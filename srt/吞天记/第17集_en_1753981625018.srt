00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Untamed

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
By the will of heaven, the emperor has made an edict.

4
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I know that the emperor's sister, Princess Wu You,

5
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
is well dressed and well-behaved, and is a gentle and kind person.

6
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
After that, the late Sun Dao Jiu, the late emperor of the state,

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
is a noble and dignified person.

8
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
They are a perfect match.

9
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Therefore, I order to grant them a marriage.

10
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The wedding will be held on the day of the next day.

11
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That's all.

12
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Please accept the edict, Your Holiness.

13
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm leaving.

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You are so stubborn.

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I will show you the real face sooner or later.

16
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Since I have granted the marriage,

17
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I can move to Wu You Palace in this name

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
to protect my sister.

19
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Your Majesty, the late emperor has moved to Wu You Palace

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and lived with the princess.

21
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What?

22
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Damn Sun Dao Jiu.

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
How dare you be so rude to me?

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
How dare you be so rude?

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm going to kill him.

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The late emperor is a good swordsman.

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We can't afford to offend him.

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You're still talking nonsense.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Do you think I don't know my own name?

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I deserve to die.

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You just let the evil two generals out.

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm going to kill that bitch's mother.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm going to kill that bitch's mother.

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yuan Hao wants the army to understand.

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But Yuan Xi is not a Taoist.

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Why would he want the soul of the dead?

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm afraid what we see is not his true face.

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What Yu means is Yuan Xi is secretly practicing Taoism?

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Your Highness.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Your Highness.

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Your Highness, something bad happened.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What's the hurry?

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The guard in the cell told me

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
that the evil two generals were released by His Majesty

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
and went to deal with Gao Ling Jun.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Deal with Gao Ling Jun?

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'll give you a death sentence

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
for killing Gao Ling Jun.

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'll give you ten thousand taels of gold.

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll give you ten thousand taels of gold.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Brother, kill them.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Brother.

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Kill them.

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Kill them all.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Poor guys.

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You're all poor guys.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You can't kill anyone.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You're so bold.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
How dare you kill Gao Ling Jun?

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Give me your life.

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You're all poor guys.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Gao Ling Jun has no grudge against you.

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What do you want to do?

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You're just a money-lender.

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Brother, kill him.

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Who are you?

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Who are you?

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm the supervisor of the Sword Sect of the Heaven.

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The princess asked me to save you.

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
A niece?

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You're Sun Dao Jiu, the famous one.

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
If I leave now,

75
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I might let you go.

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Brother, he thinks he can beat you.

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You can't see it.

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Be careful.

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
He's a master of the first-class of the Ning Qi.

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
He has thousands of lives.

81
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Kill them.

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Brother.

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You killed Zhang Hui with a stick?

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You killed my brother.

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I want your life.

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Be careful with the gold coins.

87
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You'll die if you hit me.

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Baby.

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Don't hide.

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
This thing is useful to me.

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'll use the swallow to stop you.

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm the best in the world.

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You're hit by the gold coins.

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's okay.

95
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You're fine.

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You're so strong.

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Say something to kill him.

98
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Let him continue to make money.

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I need more of this.

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You're a little trick.

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You deserve to die.

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You little bastard.

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I want you to die.

104
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You're a dead man.

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's unreasonable.

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The gold coin.

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I know.

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You want to get my money.

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Get out of here.

110
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm hit.

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What's the use of this thing to you?

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I have my own use.

113
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Why does this figure look familiar?

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Why is he here?

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You.

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What are you doing?

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You can't interfere with the mortal world.

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Don't you know?

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You killed me.

120
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You're a man of your life.

121
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'll take care of this.

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Sun Dajiang.

123
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You can't kill me.

124
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm the emperor.

125
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You don't deserve to be the emperor.

126
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I want half of it.

127
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I don't believe it.

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You're a god.

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You dare to fight me.

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I can't spare you.

131
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
God of Heaven.

132
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I didn't say anything.

133
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Sun Dajiang.

134
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm here.

135
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Mother.

136
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Help me.

137
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Calm down.

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The emperor heard that someone was in trouble here.

139
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So he brought someone to suppress.

140
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He didn't expect that the news was fake.

141
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So he created this scene.

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yes.

143
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
That's it.

144
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
If there's a next time,

145
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
don't blame me for changing his name to emperor.

146
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You scared me to death.

147
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
This damn Sun Dajiang.

148
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
How dare you kill me.

149
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Get up.

150
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Don't you feel ashamed?

151
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yes.

152
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Go back to the palace.

153
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You didn't discuss with me.

154
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
When can you be as steady as Chen?

155
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I did this for Dongyue.

156
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Mother, you're a liar.

157
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You're still being stubborn.

158
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Sun Dajiang is the one who is wronged.

159
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I can't even suppress him when I move out.

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We must get rid of him.

161
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Move out?

162
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You won't tell Sun Dajiang about your father?

163
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
No.

164
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Qingqi...

165
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
How could you say that?

166
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Calm down.

167
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I was wronged.

168
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's useless to punish him now.

169
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
There's only one person to be killed now.

170
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Sun Dajiang.

171
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
He's close to me.

172
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
He came to me from the Dao Sect in Central Plains.

173
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
We can kill him and kill Sun Dajiang.

174
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
No.

175
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'll kill him myself.

176
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Impossible.

177
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
He's back to life.

178
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You're disappointed.

179
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's not easy to die.

180
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The world is in danger.

181
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The dead will survive.

182
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
He's back to life.

183
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Xia, get me a Martial Soul.

184
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The Martial Soul is replaced by the beast.

185
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'll give it to you.

186
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You can't live without me.

187
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What Martial Soul is this?

188
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Why is it so powerful?
