1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Î£

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
White, white young man in the mud

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You broke down the mountain and played a game with me

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The moon is full of greenery, the mountains are lonely

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The road ahead is not long, the wind is too strong, I am too crazy

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,500
The mountain is still hanging, the heart is beating

21
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,000
Only one side is flat, the other is solid

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,500
I dare to break through the night

23
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,500
The wind, the snow, the moon, the people, the peach blossoms

24
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,500
The world is so beautiful

25
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,500
The Legend of Chusen

26
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,500
Episode 14

27
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,500
The Moon and the Moon

28
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,500
Episode 14

29
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,500
The Moon and the Moon

30
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,500
Ayu is as easy as when she was a child.

31
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,500
Actually I didn't have any arrangement.

32
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,500
By then, I would have used this Sword-Slaying Talisman to die with them.

33
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,500
If you want to take away the princess,

34
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,500
Unless you break through her body.

35
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,500
That's right!

36
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,500
Get out! Get out!

37
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,500
Get out! Get out!

38
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,500
Get out! Get out!

39
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,500
Get out! Get out!

40
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,500
Get out! Get out!

41
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,500
You bunch of rascals!

42
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,500
Your Majesty, let these fishermen clean up.

43
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,500
Don't get in the way of business.

44
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,500
Your Majesty!

45
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,500
Your Majesty!

46
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,500
Come and save us!

47
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,500
Your Majesty!

48
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
It's this stinky monkey.

49
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,500
Your Majesty!

50
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,500
The princess was taken away by them!

51
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,500
Your Majesty!

52
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,500
What a mistake!

53
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
You should have made the rescue yourself.

54
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Fairy,

55
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
Why did you do it here?

56
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,500
It's the Fairy's fault.

57
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,500
I didn't know that.

58
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,500
But why did you do it here?

59
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,500
The truth is,

60
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
I practiced it here.

61
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Shiliang,

62
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,500
Protect me.

63
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,500
I won't let you down.

64
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,500
A little Sword-Slaying Talisman

65
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,500
can't do anything to me.

66
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,500
Don't worry.

67
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,500
Once I've practiced you,

68
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,500
I'll send your lover to reunite with you.

69
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,500
How dare you ruin my plan!

70
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,500
Die!

71
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,500
Golden Sword!

72
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,500
You've done so much for the nine-fold body.

73
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,500
You're not a genius.

74
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,500
But the more genius you are,

75
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
the more enjoyable it is to kill.

76
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,500
Kill him!

77
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,500
Golden Light,

78
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,500
Golden Sword,

79
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,500
Kill him!

80
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,500
Behind you!

81
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
I killed him when I was ten years old.

82
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,500
Now I have 361 lives.

83
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,500
You're the next one.

84
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
Sword-Slaying Sword!

85
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Shuhu,

86
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,500
this is good.

87
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,500
You're a bit like me.

88
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
Nine-fold body,

89
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,500
you're good at it.

90
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
Let me see

91
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,500
what else you can do.

92
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,500
Dark Dragon Soul!

93
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,500
Who's stronger?

94
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,500
You're stronger than you are now.

95
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,500
You're just a slave to everything.

96
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,500
God-Slaying Stick!

97
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,500
Come here!

98
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
Ten-fold body,

99
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,500
ten-fold body,

100
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,500
ten-fold body,

101
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,500
ten-fold body,

102
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,500
Ten-fold body,

103
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,500
kill me if you want.

104
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,500
I thought you were a brave man.

105
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,500
What the hell are you doing?

106
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,500
If you tell us the truth,

107
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
we can consider keeping you alive.

108
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,500
Just

109
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,500
to make the soul skill

110
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
to kill the seven ghosts

111
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,500
and the seven heavens.

112
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,500
You're the daughter of the seven clouds.

113
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,500
If you practice,

114
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,500
you can get the heaven's power.

115
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,500
The ghost's pulse will affect the stars.

116
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,500
That's right.

117
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
By then,

118
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,500
all the immortals in the world will be no match for you.

119
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,500
Yuan Xi and the others agreed.

120
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
As long as I, Dongsheng Kingdom,

121
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,500
get ten Soul-blasting Pill

122
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,500
and 200,000 Sea Lords,

123
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,500
I can marry you to my kingdom.

124
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,500
That's all I know.

125
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,500
I'll let you go today.

126
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,500
I'll order you to go back

127
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,500
and take back the 200,000 Sea Lords.

128
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,500
If you dare to step into the Eastern Yue Kingdom again,

129
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
I'll kill you.

130
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,500
Thank you.

131
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,500
Die!

132
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
Can you help me go back and get the Soul-blasting Pill?

133
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,500
My eyes!

134
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,500
My eyes!

135
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
If you dare to touch the thoughts that shouldn't be touched,

136
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,500
you'll get more than one eye.

137
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,500
Your Highness!

138
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,500
It's the princess and the empress!

139
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,500
Your Highness!

140
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,500
Your Highness!

141
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,500
You...

142
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,500
All right, all right.

143
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,500
Don't touch me!

144
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,500
I'm back.

145
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Your Highness, Your Highness,

146
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
are you all right?

147
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
How are Youming Ji and the Nine-Winged King?

148
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,500
Youling Ji has been captured.

149
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,500
The Nine-Winged King is the first to be crowned.

150
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,500
He can't be allowed to enter the Eastern Yue Kingdom.

151
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,500
If the Nine-Winged King is not counted,

152
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,500
I'll take the key.

153
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,500
One died and one was saved.

154
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,500
Sun Dao Jiu is also difficult to kill.

155
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Fortunately, the Soul-blasting Pill has been taken.

156
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,500
The navy is still not here.

157
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
It's all the fault of that girl and Sun Dao Jiu.

158
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
And those people outside.

159
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
Because Wu You is going to rebel against the emperor.

160
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,500
There is no emperor's attitude in the world.

161
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
Look at Chen'er, she's as bad as you.

162
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,500
Why don't you give Wu You and Sun Dao Jiu a marriage?

163
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,500
This way, not only can you cover the mouths of those people,

164
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,500
but also can you practice for your mother and save time.

165
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Chen'er is right.

166
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,500
Chen'er, Chen'er.

167
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,500
From childhood to adulthood, you only have Chen'er in your eyes.

168
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,500
Chen'er.

169
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,500
Why are you still here?

170
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
Do you want me to teach you by myself?

171
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,500
Mother, I'm leaving.

172
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Master, Sun Dao Jiu is in the Eastern Yue Empire.

173
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,500
He killed the Soul-blasting Pill.

174
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,500
I'm afraid he'll summon the Seven Devils of the Red Sea.

175
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,500
You're worried that the Seven Devils of the Red Sea will be angry with you.

176
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,500
With the current power of the Seven Devils of the Red Sea,

177
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,500
I'm afraid no one can defeat the Eastern Yue capital.

178
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
The blood is coming.

179
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,500
There is no need to fear him.

180
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,500
Besides, I'm Sun Dao Jiu who killed his disciple.

181
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,500
Master, you're right.

182
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
Sun Dao Jiu, Wu You,

183
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,500
you all embarrassed me in front of my mother.

184
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
I'll let you know sooner or later

185
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,500
what the emperor is angry about.

186
