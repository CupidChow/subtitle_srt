1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,420
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,720
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:51,840
Tbeiter Xie

18
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,840
Episode 1

19
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,840
You're fooling me.

20
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,840
I don't care who you are.

21
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,840
Just kill me once more.

22
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,840
You're really talking nonsense.

23
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,840
Why are you still looking at me?

24
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,840
Just go!

25
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
Now you're dead and you're still alive.

26
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,840
You killed Zhao Chuan.

27
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,840
If the tribe knows about this,

28
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,840
you can't even leave.

29
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,840
Old man, let's go together.

30
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,840
I don't need you to care.

31
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,840
If you don't run away,

32
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,840
I'll kill myself on the tombstone.

33
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,840
Old man,

34
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,840
you've given up so many times.

35
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,840
Next time, you can change your mind.

36
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,840
How can you run away with me?

37
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,840
You've escaped from the Eastern Yue State.

38
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,840
Now I don't want to escape anymore.

39
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:12,020
I'll be a

40
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
Where am I?

41
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
What's this?

42
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,840
The mortal.

43
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,840
For thousands of years,

44
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,840
no one has been able to enter my realm.

45
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,840
You've inherited my inheritance

46
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,840
after you were born.

47
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,840
Now,

48
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,840
as long as you obey me,

49
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,840
I'll let you have endless wealth.

50
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,840
And power.

51
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,840
Who's that little devil?

52
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,840
Let go!

53
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,840
I'm a demon

54
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,840
who has been killed by thousands of people.

55
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,840
If you don't let go,

56
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,840
I'll blow you to death.

57
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,840
Let go!

58
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,840
You're not happy.

59
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,840
You're not a good person.

60
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,840
You blew yourself to death.

61
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,840
You'll be in trouble next time.

62
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,840
If you don't have the skills I had back then,

63
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,840
I wouldn't have been able to point at you.

64
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,840
First,

65
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,840
I'll start with the mortal.

66
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,840
First, I'll cut the flesh.

67
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,840
Second, I'll use the demon.

68
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,840
Third, I'll train my bones.

69
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,840
Fourth, I'll use the five-storied six-storied.

70
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,840
After I've changed my blood,

71
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,840
I'll learn the whole body.

72
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,840
Finally,

73
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,840
I'll train my spirit.

74
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,840
Spirit and flesh are one and the same.

75
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,840
You're too slow.

76
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,840
You're really bad at this.

77
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,840
You've only made it through three levels in a month.

78
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,840
You're like me back then.

79
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,840
Why is the battlefield over there so big?

80
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,840
I think I should be able to train normally.

81
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,840
With your strength,

82
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,840
you can make a living by making a living.

83
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,840
I advise you not to meddle in other people's business.

84
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,840
Just focus on training outside.

85
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,840
You're talking too much.

86
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,840
You're really a coward in my eyes.

87
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,840
Yin Lu!

88
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,840
My spirit is running out of power.

89
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,840
Turn around!

90
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,840
You've only made it through three levels.

91
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,840
You can't beat the six-storied black bear spirit.

92
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,840
Hurry and turn around.

93
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,840
I can escape myself.

94
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,840
I can't be a showman.

95
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,840
Senior, you've found a way to deal with it.

96
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,840
The black bear spirit seems to be out of control.

97
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,840
It's out of control.

98
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
I don't know.

99
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,840
I came to check the movement of the demon hand.

100
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,840
There's still something wrong.

101
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,840
Oh, right.

102
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,840
I forgot to ask what your name is.

103
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,840
My name is Su.

104
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,840
Be careful.

105
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,840
Senior Su,

106
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,840
be careful.

107
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,840
Prince.

108
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,840
Why are you running?

109
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,840
The monster is running away.

110
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,840
Right.

111
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,840
Good chance.

112
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,840
Hit his eyes.

113
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,840
Hurry up.

114
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,840
His face.

115
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,840
What's the use of running?

116
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,840
Go back.

117
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,840
Don't listen to me.

118
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,840
I'll be back.

119
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,840
You're a fool.

120
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,840
You talk too much.

121
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,840
You...

122
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,840
Yin Lu!

123
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,840
The spirit is running out of power.

124
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,840
The black bear spirit is out of control.

125
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,840
Come on.

126
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,840
Hey!

127
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,840
This guy is okay.

128
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,840
This place is familiar to me.

129
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,840
You'll catch a cold if you wear wet clothes.

130
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,840
Eat something.

131
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,840
You can recover your strength.

132
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,840
Why don't you talk?

133
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,840
Doesn't the power of the spirit power the mind?

134
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,840
You talk too much.

135
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,840
Your wound will be infected if you wrap it like this.

136
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,840
Just bear it.

137
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,840
Why did you insist on saving me just now?

138
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,840
Maybe I was too much.

139
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,840
So I always want to do something.

140
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,840
Much better.

141
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,840
Much better.

142
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,840
Why did you appear here?

143
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,840
I heard a fight in the forest when I was training.

144
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,840
So I came to check.

145
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,840
Sister Su, let's go back and report to the leader first.

146
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,840
It's too late.

147
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,840
I'm afraid the clue will be broken when the leader comes.

148
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,840
I was just...

149
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,840
I'm sorry.

150
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,840
You brat, you have a bad habit.

151
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,840
How many beasts died here?

152
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,840
The whip of the previous Situ

153
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,840
didn't kill him.

154
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,840
What a big name!

155
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,840
Yes.

156
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,840
A while ago, the mountain range was hit by a fire.

157
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,840
Even the governor Zhao was buried in the tent.

158
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,840
He can still come out.

159
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,840
Luo Yun, hurry up.

160
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,840
Don't let him recognize you.

161
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,840
Tomorrow is the test of the evil spirit.

162
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,840
There's no need to be so generous.

163
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,840
Some problems can't be solved by escaping.

164
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,840
You're still alive.

165
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:51,180
I can't even beat a little

166
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,840
You can try.

167
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,840
How dare you!

168
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,840
Master Su is here.

169
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,840
Today,

170
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,840
I'll kill you.

171
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,840
Luo, you lure them here.

172
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,840
Let's kill them all together.

173
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,840
The evil spirit is here.

174
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,840
Five swords are combined.

175
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,840
The god sword is broken.

176
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,840
Meng Yi, Zi Yan.

177
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,840
I won't leave any of them.

178
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,840
I'll kill you.

179
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,840
I'll kill you.

180
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,840
I'll kill you.

181
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,840
I'll kill you.

182
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,840
I'll kill you.

183
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,840
I'll kill you.

184
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,840
I'll kill you.

185
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,840
I'll kill you.

186
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,840
I'll kill you.

187
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,840
I'll kill you.

188
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,840
