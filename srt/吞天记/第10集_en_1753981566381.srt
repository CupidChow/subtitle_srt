1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
She's here!

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm here, too!

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So nervous!

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh no, I can't untie you.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
alm

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Just bystander

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
take me

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Let's start.

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Beautiful

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,280
My brother is

25
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,400
over influence.

26
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,000
Wait for me.

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
wait for me here.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
it's okay.

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Did you hear that?

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Our emperor's brother Yuan Chen

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
is coming back from the palace.

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Is our Dongyue country

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
the god of Yuan Chen

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
or Yuan Hao?

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Don't talk about politics.

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Did you forget that

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Zhongwu was taken away just now?

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The fourth king

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
is the one who is the best

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
in the world.

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Li Bi.

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Your Majesty.

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Just now, the god was looking for me

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and went to the dreamland.

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You guys

64
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
are not lucky.

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Let me go.

66
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Who dares to make a scene at the ceremony?

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Bring him here.

68
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Come on.

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Let me hear

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
what you said.

71
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
These years,

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
in order to build the holy tower,

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
you destroyed the foundation

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
of our Dongyue country for decades.

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You even tried to steal the princess of Xishan

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and let hundreds of thousands of soldiers

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
kill her.

78
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You, Yuan Hao,

79
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
you deserve to be the god of Dongyue.

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You deserve to be the god of the ancestors.

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You dare to scold me?

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Kill him.

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Wait.

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Long live the god.

85
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
My good brother.

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You finally come.

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Your Majesty.

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Today is the ceremony of the sacrifice.

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
We are all the same.

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You can't see it.

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You are really the god of the Middle Way.

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You actually

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
show your anger to the common people.

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yuan Hao.

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
If he didn't take advantage of you, Yuan Chen,

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
the god's brother,

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
how dare he do something wrong?

98
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You guys

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
are just a group of one.

100
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I, the god,

101
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
will not argue with you, the common people.

102
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You are a great god.

103
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But you dare to slander me?

104
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You have to pay for it.

105
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Be good.

106
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I've raised you for so long.

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's time to work.

108
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You think you can kill me?

109
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
No one will know if you do it.

110
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I tell you.

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Those miserable people will remember.

112
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
They will bite you.

113
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Their descendants,

114
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
the descendants of the descendants will remember.

115
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You will never kill him.

116
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
One day,

117
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
someone will see

118
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
your god's head.

119
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Why are you standing here?

120
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Kill him.

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Kill him.

122
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Who killed my god?

123
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I want him to be buried.

124
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Who do you want to be buried with?

125
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The god.

126
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Who are you?

127
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Sun Daoqiu.

128
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Don't you know

129
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
that the Eastern Yue State

130
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
is under my control?

131
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You are a god.

132
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The imperial examination order of the Eastern Heaven

133
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
is to take the position of god.

134
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Sun Daoqiu.

135
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
As the next god of the country,

136
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
you want to cover up the criminal?

137
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What crime did Zhongwu commit?

138
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
He disrespected the emperor.

139
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He should be killed.

140
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yes.

141
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
He dared to slander me.

142
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You should fight.

143
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
No.

144
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You should kill.

145
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I deserve to die.

146
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
If you disrespected the emperor,

147
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
what about the god?

148
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Are you sure you want to

149
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
offend my Daozong?

150
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You are not ready to die.

151
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You are not ready to die.

152
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Okay.

153
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Let me see

154
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
how capable you are

155
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
to protect the god.

156
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
We have been friends for nine times.

157
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Nine times?

158
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Even if it's ten times,

159
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I, Yuan Chen, have been defeated.

160
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You are too weak.

161
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Defeating you is enough.

162
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You are my little stone.

163
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Lightning Sword.

164
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Dragon Moon.

165
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What?

166
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You are so arrogant.

167
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You are not that capable.

168
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Stop fighting.

169
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's more important to protect the god.

170
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Since I was born,

171
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
you are the first person

172
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
who made me bleed.

173
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm not used to it.

174
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Stay longer.

175
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You will get used to it.

176
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Today,

177
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I will make you suffer.

178
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Okay.

179
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The God of War

180
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Greetings, young master Wu.

181
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yuan Hao.

182
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
If you dare to do something ridiculous again,

183
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I will destroy your position as the emperor.

184
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yes.

185
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I will never do it again.

186
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yuan Chen.

187
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You are fighting for power and the people.

188
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Do you know your mistake?

189
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I know my mistake.

190
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm sorry for my misdeed.

191
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Please forgive me.

192
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm sorry.

193
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Next.

194
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
If Yuan Chen does it again,

195
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I will tie him up in front of you

196
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
and kowtow.

197
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You are the god who has protected the Eastern Courtyard for decades.

198
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You are just being fair.

199
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
We are in a dilemma.

200
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Can you talk to Yuan Xi?

201
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I still have to practice the elixir.

202
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I will hand over the Eastern Courtyard to you in a month.

203
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
As you wish.

204
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I have already set up a banquet for you.

205
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Please.

206
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Wu Yu.

207
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You have been involved in the war.

208
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You have just entered the battlefield.

209
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You are now the crown prince of the Eastern Courtyard.

210
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You will be the emperor of Eastern Courtyard.

211
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
A Yan.

212
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Let go.

213
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I didn't expect Yuan Xi to still refuse to let me go.

214
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
There is a dead man who makes people calm.

215
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Poor thing.

216
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
No.

217
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I will send you to see your poisoned queen.

218
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You are a traitor.

219
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
How dare you interfere in my Eastern Courtyard?

220
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's crazy.

221
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Wu Yu should die.

222
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I will kill you.

223
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Wu Yu.

224
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Wu Yu.

225
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Wu Yu.

226
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Wu Yu.

227
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Wu Yu.

228
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Wu Yu.

229
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Wu Yu.

230
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Wu Yu.

231
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Wu Yu.

232
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Wu Yu.

233
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Wu Yu.

234
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Wu Yu.

235
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Wu Yu.

236
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Wu Yu.

237
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Wu Yu.

238
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Wu Yu.

239
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Wu Yu.

240
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Wu Yu.

241
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Wu Yu.

242
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Wu Yu.

243
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Wu Yu.

244
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Wu Yu.

245
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Wu Yu.

246
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Wu Yu.

247
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Wu Yu.

248
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Wu Yu.

249
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Wu Yu.
