00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Episode 4

17
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,600
You're so strong.

18
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,920
How can you defeat him?

19
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,000
Besides,

20
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,400
you're injured in the Blood Valley.

21
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
You haven't fully recovered.

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Why are you so stubborn?

23
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
Can't we defeat him?

24
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,400
Why don't you kill me?

25
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,800
Are you going to watch the outsiders

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,400
and threaten us?

27
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,000
If my brother is still here,

28
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,600
I'll definitely

29
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,200
kill him.

30
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
Who else?

31
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,800
The Dao Sect in Central Plains rarely contacts us.

32
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,600
Why do you suddenly propose a competition

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,800
to test his ability?

34
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,400
Not only that,

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,400
I'm afraid I want to use this

36
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,200
to investigate the spirit energy fountain.

37
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,000
Jiang Xiao has the spirit energy five-fold level.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
He's really extraordinary.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,600
My son has been used to it since he was a child.

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,400
He always wants to compete with the masters of your sect.

41
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,600
He's not easy to beat.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,400
Please forgive him.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,800
Usually, the disciples of my sect

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,800
are more than the spirit energy level.

45
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,800
This is not worth mentioning.

46
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:20,800
Next.

47
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,400
Wait.

48
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,400
I know that your sect

49
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,000
has a disciple named Wu Yu.

50
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,400
Can he join the Fight Immortal Sect?

51
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,600
Wu Yu

52
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,400
has an important matter to discuss.

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,200
Xiao You, please send other disciples to compete with me.

54
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,200
Important matter?

55
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,400
I heard that a month ago,

56
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,400
your sect sent many disciples to die in the Fairyland Valley.

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,600
Is Wu Yu one of them?

58
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,400
Even your disciples

59
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,800
are also in it.

60
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,600
All the great ones are dead in it.

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,400
No wonder the rest

62
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
are all ordinary people.

63
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,000
You!

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,200
Wu Yu.

65
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,400
Yun Lin.

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,400
Mind your words.

67
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,000
But if you forget about it,

68
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,600
no one here is my opponent.

69
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,600
Nonsense.

70
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,200
What did you say?

71
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,200
You beat your own disciples who were inferior to you.

72
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,600
You're talking nonsense.

73
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,400
Do you want to see the whole world

74
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,000
or look up to yourself?

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,600
You!

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You lost to Wu Yu in the Eastern Courtyard before.

77
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,000
You want to turn it around today, right?

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You're Wu Yu's senior sister?

79
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Defeating you

80
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,800
is not defeating Wu Yu.

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I beat you.

82
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,200
Does it mean I beat the whole Middle School?

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,800
My armor is very hard.

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,200
The object in your hand

85
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,200
can't hurt me at all.

86
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,000
It's just a turtle shell.

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The Middle School doesn't have

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,600
the same treasure of the deity?

89
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,000
So,

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,600
you!

91
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,000
My strength is very strong.

92
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,800
You can't break it easily.

93
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,200
Really?

94
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,600
Take a closer look.

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,400
How dare you damage my armor?

96
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
I'll kill you!

97
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
You have power and power.

98
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,220
You'll definitely victory,

99
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,280
you hear me?

100
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,460
Wait.

101
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:29,740
Yeah.

102
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:30,640
You...

103
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,820
Where are you going?

104
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:35,640
It's not your fault.

105
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,860
Just give up.

106
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,560
You're just letting yourself get hurt.

107
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,860
I want to attack right away...

108
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,080
But I called senin...

109
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,120
Butshiyue!

110
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,460
sleeping voice

111
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,180
So he didn't die!

112
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,900
...

113
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,140
I won manicuristic.

114
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,740
He came back alive.

115
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,280
I'm worried.

116
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,640
After the IC won,

117
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,040
pardon him.

118
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,480
Yi Ling is better than you.

119
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,480
You're not strong enough.

120
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,480
You're not strong enough.

121
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,480
You...

122
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,480
You're a piece of shit.

123
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,480
You're afraid I can't even stop you.

124
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,480
Really?

125
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,480
Senior,

126
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,480
use the sword.

127
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,480
Wu Yu,

128
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,480
I've been practicing swords for over 20 years.

129
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,480
You want to compete with me?

130
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,480
Can you use the sword?

131
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,480
I'll show you.

132
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,480
You'll see.

133
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,480
You'll see.

134
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,480
I'm born with the power of the heaven and earth.

135
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,480
I can do anything.

136
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,480
I'm the king of heaven and earth.

137
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
What?

138
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,480
I'm the king of the world.

139
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,480
Don't...

140
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,480
Don't kill me.

141
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
Don't kill me.

142
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,480
Father, save me.

143
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,480
How dare you hurt my son?

144
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,480
How can a Zongmen competition not be hurt?

145
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,480
The young master is not as good as others.

146
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,480
No matter how many skills you have, it's useless.

147
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,480
Clan Leader Jiang,

148
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,480
the kids are just competing.

149
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,480
Don't lose the elders' spirit.

150
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,480
Well said.

151
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,480
You haven't congratulated the elder's disciples

152
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,480
and come back to life.

153
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,480
I'm sure you have a lot to talk about.

154
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,480
I'm not going to have this fun.

155
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,480
Clan Leader Jiang,

156
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,480
the Dao Sect in the Central Plains is very hostile.

157
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,480
Please stick to your heart.

158
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,480
Avoid miscalculation

159
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,480
and fall into evil ways.

160
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,480
Master,

161
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
the disciples are back.

162
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,480
That's good.

163
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,480
Thank you, Senior.

164
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,480
I knew you would win.

165
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,480
Brother,

166
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
I miss you so much.

167
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,480
Wu Yu!

168
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,480
Wu Yu!

169
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,480
Aunt,

170
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,480
it's good that you're back.

171
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,480
Wu Yu saved me.

172
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,480
If it weren't for him,

173
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,480
I'm afraid I would have died in the Fairy Valley.

174
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,480
Master Dao?

175
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,480
It's the Fairy of the Fools.

176
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,480
She followed the elder to protect the Fairy Valley.

177
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,480
It's almost a hundred years.

178
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,480
Thank you, Senior.

179
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,480
Sister,

180
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,480
I'll collect the waste.

181
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,480
In the heaven,

182
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,480
I'll take care of you.

183
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,480
If you want to be strong,

184
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,480
collect more waste.

185
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,480
Become the strongest in the three realms.

186
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,480
Wu Yu!

187
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,480
Wu Yu!

188
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,480
Wu Yu!

189
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,480
Wu Yu!

190
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,480
Wu Yu!

191
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,480
