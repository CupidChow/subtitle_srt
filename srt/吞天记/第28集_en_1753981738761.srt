1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Long time, no see

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Wait for me

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I swearекст

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Still no answer

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be the Kings Janeiro

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
If you have to do it, did you say that?

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I do what you do

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
All of you

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I do what you do

24
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You speak

25
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I don't look at you

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You take a picture

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I don't look at you

28
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You>-

29
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

30
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

31
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

33
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

34
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

35
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

36
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

37
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

38
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

39
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

40
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

41
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

42
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

43
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

44
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

45
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

46
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

47
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

48
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

49
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

50
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

51
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

52
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

53
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

54
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

55
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

56
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

57
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Episode 30

58
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
He has my blood.

59
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm going to take him back to Huqi Mountain.

60
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You're ridiculous.

61
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
He's not a monster at first sight.

62
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I will never let you take him back to Huqi Mountain.

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I will never let you take him back to Huqi Mountain.

64
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He has the Golden-Hedged Buddha in his body.

65
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
He has the Golden-Hedged Buddha in his body.

66
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Why are you sitting here?

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Go after him.

68
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
No need to go after him.

69
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
He will come back to us later.

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What do you mean?

71
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The show is about to start.

72
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You just wait and see.

73
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You just wait and see.

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The Black Bear Crystal is really a despicable person.

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The Black Bear Crystal is really a despicable person.

76
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
When I find the source,

77
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I will cut it into pieces.

78
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And then sew his chest into a dress and put it on.

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And then sew his chest into a dress and put it on.

80
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
If you're not stupid enough to go beyond the forbidden path,

81
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
we don't have to fall into the black bear crystal trap.

82
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The sea water and moon are suffering with us.

83
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The sea water and moon are suffering with us.

84
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You said you were going to go there.

85
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You two idiots shut up.

86
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Thanks to Mr. Kun,

87
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
you can't beat us.

88
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You can't beat us.

89
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I advise you to let us go.

90
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Otherwise, the deep-dwellers will not forgive you.

91
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
After today,

92
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
let alone the deep-dwellers,

93
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
even if your chief comes,

94
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm not afraid.

95
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What do you mean?

96
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Black Bear.

97
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Fox-teeth, I've done as you arranged.

98
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Fox-teeth, I've done as you arranged.

99
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Eight people, none of them.

100
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's that fox demon.

101
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Who is that?

102
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Is it a demon?

103
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Idiot, it's not a demon.

104
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
How can you fight with it?

105
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That's right.

106
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Do it.

107
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Okay.

108
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm from the Feng Tian Sword Sect.

109
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You can kill me if you want.

110
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
If you don't kill them,

111
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
how can you open the seal of the Demon Tower?

112
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Open the seal of the Demon Tower?

113
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Open the seal of the Demon Tower?

114
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
He...

115
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
He wants to kill us.

116
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
No, it's impossible.

117
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The seal of the Demon Tower

118
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
was set by the chief and master.

119
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's impossible for the common people to break it.

120
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Unless...

121
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Unless they know the secret.

122
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The demon knows a lot.

123
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Four...

124
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Four?

125
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
How can you break the secret

126
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
of the chief and master

127
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
if you have these people?

128
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
If the demon comes out,

129
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'll be the first one to kill it.

130
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'll be the first one to kill it.

131
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm a disciple of the Feng Tian Sword Sect.

132
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'll kill you.

133
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'll kill you.

134
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Dragon Pillar.

135
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Two moves.

136
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Chief,

137
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
although you're my blood,

138
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
it doesn't mean I'll let you die again.

139
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
If you disobey me again,

140
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
don't blame me for killing you.

141
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Four.

142
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Three.

143
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Black Bear, kill them.

144
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Black Bear, I don't believe in women.

145
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'll give you the red hair girl.

146
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I want this little girl.

147
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Don't come over.

148
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You.

149
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm your opponent.

150
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'll help you get back.

151
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Stop.

152
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Oh no.

153
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
This little girl has this move.

154
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Black Night, horizontal attack.

155
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Wuyi, you're my big brother.

156
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Let's go.

157
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The seal of the Demon Tower is not broken.

158
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Don't try to escape.

159
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Let's go.

160
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Shun Yue, hurry.

161
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Shun Yue, hurry.

162
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You.

163
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What are you doing?

164
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm staying.

165
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'll kill you.

166
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You can't die.

167
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You have to die.

168
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Black Bear.

169
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I think you're just like this when you go to Xichun.

170
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Then let you taste something powerful.

171
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Listen.

172
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Back up.

173
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
There is only one ending for you to stay with her.

174
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Go to hell.

175
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Are you okay?

176
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Watch out.

177
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Since you let them escape,

178
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'll use the Golden Armor in your body.

179
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Break the seal.

180
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Wuyi.

181
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Wuyi.

182
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Am I dead?

183
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
No.

184
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But...

185
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What's going on?

186
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Wuyi.

187
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
She's attacking me.

188
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What's that?

189
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What's that?

190
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's the second barrier.

191
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The Demon-slaying Seal.

192
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The Demon-slaying Seal?

193
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Once the first barrier is broken,

194
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
the second barrier will appear.

195
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's the whole Demon-slaying Tower.

196
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
In case the demons escape.

197
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Then everything we did was in vain.

198
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Damn it.

199
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I must cut it into pieces.

200
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The Demon-slaying Seal needs three strong Golden Elixirs

201
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
to unite.

202
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
With our power,

203
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
we can't stop it.

204
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Let's go.

205
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
How dare you

206
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
to make trouble in my valley?

207
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You're a bandit.

208
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You're not the demon of my valley.

209
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But since you're here,

210
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I don't have to go.

211
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Don't be afraid.

212
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I only killed one of them.

213
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
With our power, I'll destroy him.

214
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Who said he was the only one?

215
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm sorry.

216
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm sorry.

217
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm sorry.

218
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm sorry.

219
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm sorry.

220
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm sorry.

221
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm sorry.

222
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm sorry.

223
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm sorry.

224
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm sorry.

225
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm sorry.

226
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm sorry.

227
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm sorry.

228
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm sorry.

229
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm sorry.

230
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm sorry.

231
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm sorry.

232
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm sorry.

233
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm sorry.

234
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm sorry.

235
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm sorry.

236
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm sorry.

237
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm sorry.

238
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm sorry.

239
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm sorry.

240
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm sorry.

241
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm sorry.

242
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm sorry.

243
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm sorry.

244
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm sorry.

245
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm sorry.

246
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm sorry.

247
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm sorry.

248
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm sorry.

249
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm sorry.

250
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm sorry.

251
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm sorry.

252
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm sorry.

253
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm sorry.

254
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm sorry.

255
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm sorry.

256
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm sorry.
