1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,000
...

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
In the middle of the world

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,960
is my young年的

18
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:52,060
Water 유

19
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,300
?

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The future is not perfect, the wind is too strong

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The mountain is still strange, the heart is still beating

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The only thing left is a piece of gold

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I dare to break through the night

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The wind, the snow, the moon, the people, the grass, the flowers

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The grass, the flowers, the grass, the flowers, the grass, the flowers

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The wind, the snow, the grass, the grass, the flowers

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The grass, the flowers, the grass, the grass, the grass

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The grass, the snow, the grass, the grass, the grass

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The grass, the snow, the grass, the grass, the grass

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The grass, the snow, the grass, the grass, the grass

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The grass, the snow, the grass, the grass, the grass

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The grass, the snow, the grass, the grass, the grass

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The grass, the snow, the grass, the grass, the grass

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The grass, the snow, the grass, the grass

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The grass, the snow, the grass, the grass

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The grass, the snow, the grass, the grass

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The grass, the snow, the grass, the grass

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The grass, the snow, the grass, the grass

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The grass, the snow, the grass, the grass

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The grass, the snow, the grass, the grass

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The grass, the snow, the grass, the grass

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The grass, the snow, the grass, the grass

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The grass, the snow, the grass, the grass

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:07,460
Zhu Bai

45
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,460
What did the fairy ask me for?

46
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,460
I thought you were dead.

47
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,460
I'm lucky.

48
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,460
God can't take me.

49
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,460
You must have suffered a lot these years.

50
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,460
That day Yuan Xi sent Wanqing to kill me.

51
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,460
Fortunately, my master saved my life.

52
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,460
Everyone took good care of me.

53
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,460
But you, sister,

54
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,460
were married to the tyrant by these little people.

55
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,460
I can't spare them.

56
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,460
Yuan Xi and her son tried their best to succeed this alliance.

57
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,460
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,460
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,460
I'm sorry.

60
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,460
I'm sorry.

61
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,460
I'm sorry.

62
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,460
Yuan Xi and her son tried their best to succeed this alliance.

63
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,460
I'm afraid there's something wrong with Dongsheng.

64
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,460
His Majesty is here.

65
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,460
God,

66
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,460
why are you here?

67
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,460
I was attacked by the snake demon on my way back to the palace.

68
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,460
God Sun saved me.

69
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,460
I want to thank you.

70
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,460
So I invited him to the palace.

71
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,460
This girl,

72
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,460
is she trying to get my son to get married?

73
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,460
I won't let you get away with this.

74
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,460
I heard that there are demons in the city.

75
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,460
I'm going to get a thousand elite soldiers to guard Wuyo Palace

76
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,460
to protect you.

77
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,460
Thank you, Your Majesty.

78
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,460
And...

79
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,460
Have you ever heard of

80
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,460
the national poet of the Nine Kings,

81
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,460
You Lingji?

82
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,460
He's a master of the Ningqi Sect.

83
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,460
Even Sun Shangxian

84
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,460
is no match for him.

85
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,460
What do you mean, Your Majesty?

86
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,460
What do I mean?

87
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,460
Your little girl

88
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,460
can escape from me.

89
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,460
A Sun Shangxian

90
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,460
can't fight against the whole Dongsheng.

91
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,460
I understand.

92
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,460
Good.

93
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,460
You're a bad monkey.

94
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,460
I'll pull your...

95
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,460
I'm not as sharp as a bad monkey.

96
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,460
Get married and go back to the palace.

97
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,460
Sister.

98
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,460
Yu.

99
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,460
Do you remember Zhongwu?

100
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,460
After you left,

101
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,460
he followed me

102
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,460
and helped me do things.

103
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,460
Zhongwu found out that Yuan Xi sent people to take over the refugees in the southeast.

104
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,460
I'm afraid there's something wrong with this.

105
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,460
What does he want to do?

106
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,460
No clue.

107
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,460
Yuan Hao sent soldiers to imprison me.

108
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,460
I can't act.

109
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,460
You take this to find Zhongwu.

110
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,460
I have to help him.

111
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,460
What about the marriage?

112
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,460
Go.

113
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,460
This is a long-term plan.

114
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,460
You Lingji is hard to deal with.

115
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,460
If you don't get away with it,

116
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,860
I'll go to the

117
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,460
death of my late father.

118
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,460
How's it going?

119
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,460
If nothing happens,

120
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,460
we can do it as planned.

121
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,460
Good job.

122
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,460
Besides,

123
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,460
it's a big deal.

124
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,460
If you're not careful, you'll get burned.

125
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,460
No one else can know.

126
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,460
Wanqing is dead.

127
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,460
He was killed by the knife.

128
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,460
Please don't be angry.

129
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,460
Wanqing can't hide his power.

130
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,460
If he's not killed by Sun Daojiu today,

131
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,460
he'll be killed by Sun Dao Shi tomorrow.

132
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,460
It's too late to die.

133
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,460
Mother.

134
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,460
Mother.

135
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,460
Bad news.

136
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,460
You're so reckless.

137
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,460
How can you be so impolite?

138
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,460
I just went to the Wuyou Palace.

139
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,460
I saw that Wuyou invited Sun Daojiu.

140
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,460
They said they were effective.

141
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,460
That's called a close friend.

142
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,460
Two people who can't fight.

143
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,460
How can they hook him up?

144
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,460
You don't know that?

145
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,460
Wuyou was attacked by the snake demon.

146
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,460
Sun Daojiu saved her.

147
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,460
She's a person who's giving out the news.

148
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,460
If she really hooks up with Sun Daojiu,

149
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,460
do you think you can get the 200,000 navy of the Jiu Shi Army?

150
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,460
Don't worry.

151
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,460
I've warned her.

152
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,460
Wuyou, the dead girl,

153
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,460
will never dare to make a mistake.

154
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,460
Wuyou doesn't dare.

155
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,460
It doesn't mean Sun Daojiu doesn't dare.

156
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,460
Mother.

157
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,460
Do you think Wuyou, the dead girl,

158
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,460
will really hook Sun Daojiu up to get married?

159
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,460
Wuyou is the best at captivating people.

160
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,460
She knows Sun Daojiu is as evil as an enemy.

161
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,460
She will definitely use her

162
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,460
to deal with the Jiu Shi Army.

163
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,460
What should we do, Mother?

164
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,460
It's not good for us if she hooks up with Sun Daojiu.

165
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,460
Since Sun Daojiu can't be used by us,

166
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,460
it can't be used by her.

167
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,460
White-haired Shihong.

168
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,460
Sun Daojiu is yours.

169
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,460
Yes.

170
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,460
How should I explain to the Sword Sect?

171
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,460
Sun Daojiu is as evil as an enemy.

172
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,460
He will be killed by the evil demon.

173
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,460
The Sword Sect will not blame us.

174
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,460
So clever.

175
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,460
Come on, sir.

176
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,460
I'll feed you grapes.

177
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,460
Yes.

178
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,460
Miss, I want to ask you something.

179
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,460
Sir.

180
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,460
You can't drink this cup of wine.

181
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,460
Who is it?

182
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,460
The Deity.

183
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,460
The Princess asked me to help you.

184
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,460
This is indeed the gold hairpin of Miss.

185
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,460
But why are you here?

186
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,460
The Deity doesn't know that

187
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,460
the Golden-Haired Tower is a place of circulation.

188
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,460
There is another way.

189
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,460
Yunxi hid people here.

190
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,460
There are some clues.

191
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,460
What's that sound?

192
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,460
Move away.

193
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,460
What a big bone.

194
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,460
A demon with ten demons.

195
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,460
Who is this?

196
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,460
Great.

197
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,460
gospel.

198
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,460
Is she a hero?

199
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,460
Regarding speed of Education,

200
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,460
we may lose.

201
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,460
Yes!

202
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,380
Go you

203
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,620
What happened inside

204
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,960
Such a big move

205
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,880
Are you fighting

206
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,040
Get in quickly

207
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,160
Don't get into trouble

208
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,460
Where are they?

209
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:40,220
Odin has stepped on the

210
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:51,820
world

211
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:03,040
I'm going to make a

212
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,180
little bit of a

213
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,100
little bit of a

214
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,820
little bit of a

215
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,540
little bit of a

216
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,140
little bit of a

217
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,780
little bit of a

218
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,860
little bit of a

219
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,860
little bit of a

220
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,860
little bit of a

221
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,860
little bit of a

222
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,100
little bit of a

223
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,100
little bit of a

224
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,100
little bit of a

225
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,100
little bit of a

226
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,380
When it starts it

227
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,380
starts to traveling

228
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,380
It starts to væiver

229
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,380
It starts to w scrambled

230
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,380
It's fast

231
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,380
It's a little slow

232
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,340
Qui-

233
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,200
Nan

234
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,520
