1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
incredibly lovely

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
amazing

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I heard of

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,600
a белый шел Д

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
какución

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Гроб

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
brushing

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Love is hard to bear,

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Grief is hard to bear.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Like a butterfly,

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The soul is lost.

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The broken heart is broken.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Looking back,

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The world is broken.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The broken heart is broken.

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The broken heart is broken.

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Lan Shui Yue?

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's you again.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
We are really far apart.

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I know that you hate this Wu Yu.

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I happened to meet him.

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I brought him and the fat pig together.

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I brought him and the fat pig together.

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'll teach you a lesson.

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Fat pig?

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Fat pig?

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Sister Su Si, are you talking about me?

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Who else is it?

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You're a dead fat pig.

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
If I didn't bet on losing,

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I wouldn't have lied to you and beat you up.

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I wouldn't have lied to you and beat you up.

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You're so bad.

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Sister Su Si, I...

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Stop.

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Is it fun to play with others?

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You're dead.

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You're talking for others.

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Ning Hong Yi, you and I will deal with Wu Yu.

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Zhao Chang Tian, Yi Qing Feng, Su Ci, you...

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Wait.

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Sister Su Si,

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
will you talk to me after you beat me up?

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Idiot.

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Watch this.

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So you will talk to me, right?

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'll dodge.

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay, I won't.

77
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I won't dodge.

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
This idiot.

79
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You still have the guts to beat others.

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You're really a bastard.

81
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Sister Su Si,

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I didn't understand what you said.

83
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
This kid is a bit capable.

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Fat pig, let go of me.

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Okay.

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Wait.

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
No.

88
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I can't even deal with Tang Batian.

89
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'll deal with that fat pig after I get rid of you.

90
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Sister Su Si, I'm here to save you.

91
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Stop.

92
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Catch me.

93
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yi Qing Feng, Zhao Chang Tian,

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
cut that fat pig off.

95
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yin Yan Wu.

96
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yin Yan Wu.

97
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Xue Zhi Shan.

98
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yi Long Pan Zhu.

99
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Senior Hong Yi planted the fairy roots one year ago.

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Now he is the fifth-level of the Neng Qi.

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The power is far above you.

102
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Wu Yue, today is your death day.

103
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Sister Su Si, give me your hand.

104
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Go away.

105
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I don't even want to die for you.

106
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Xue Yue.

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Be careful.

108
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Go.

109
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
This... this is a demon's seal.

110
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's a big demon.

111
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Help.

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Help.

113
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Don't touch him.

114
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The demon's pit has a poison.

115
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Their lives...

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Don't touch him.

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Xue Yue, help.

118
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Save him first.

119
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Help.

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Brother Wu.

121
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Brother Wu, he's coming again.

122
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yi Long Pan Zhu.

123
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Sister Su Si.

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Sister Su Si.

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
He was going to kill you.

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Why did you risk your life to save him?

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
He's not a human.

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
He's a demon.

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
He's a demon.

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
He's a demon.

131
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
He's a demon.

132
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
He risked his life to save him.

133
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's his business to kill me.

134
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's my business to save him.

135
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
If he dies in front of me like that,

136
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm afraid I'll never forgive myself in my life.

137
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Sister Su Si.

138
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What is love in the world?

139
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's just a matter of life and death.

140
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But you can't be stupid enough to not care about your life.

141
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You're such a fool.

142
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Brother Wu, you're so nice to me.

143
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You saved my life just now.

144
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
From now on, you're my big brother.

145
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Wu Yue.

146
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
We haven't settled our score yet.

147
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What happened before has been cleared with you.

148
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You're provoking me again and again.

149
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You think I'm not angry?

150
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You want to be angry in front of my grandma?

151
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'll kill you.

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You're the one who wants to die.

153
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Let go of me.

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
What are you doing?

155
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Wu Yue, let go of Shui Yue.

156
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
As long as you promise not to bother me again,

157
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'll be magnanimous today.

158
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Let you go.

159
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I... I promise you.

160
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
If you dare to break your promise,

161
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I won't forgive you.

162
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Let's go.

163
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'll kill him.

164
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
No hurry.

165
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Follow him.

166
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Shui Yue, why are you still chasing Wu Yue?

167
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Don't tell me you like him.

168
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You fool.

169
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Do you think I like him?

170
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
If you talk nonsense again,

171
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'll tear your mouth.

172
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'll tear your mouth.

173
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The smell of you is so fragrant.

174
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yes.

175
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Me?

176
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Guess.

177
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Among the new core disciples,

178
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
there is no such person as you.

179
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's a demon.

180
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The blood of a woman

181
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
is more delicious than that of a man.

182
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The test of the eternal land

183
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
will begin immediately.

184
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Today,

185
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
we'll be in a tight spot.

186
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Brother Luo,

187
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
you lure them here.

188
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
