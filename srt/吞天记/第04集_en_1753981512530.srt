1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,000
No letters written criminal or offense in writings.

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,980
Somewhere in a corner,

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:47,040
A white-skinned young man

18
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,760
He courageously defends his country,

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:57,460
The country had failed and fallen into the well.

20
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,460
Episode 14

21
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,460
The Heavens are in danger

22
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,460
and the Heavens are fighting

23
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,460
and the Earth is fighting

24
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,460
and the demons are fighting

25
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,460
Congratulations to all of you for passing the Immortal Riding Path

26
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,460
Next,

27
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,460
is the Immortal Riding Platform Battle

28
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,460
Whoever can grab the immortal ball

29
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,460
and stand on the Immortal Riding Platform

30
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,460
until the end

31
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,460
will be the winner

32
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,460
Okay, let's go

33
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,460
The winner can get two treasures

34
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,460
The first one is the elixir of peace

35
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,460
This is the elixir that the Gold Elixir Master made

36
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,460
It can help to break the impurities and get into the peace

37
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,460
The second one is the best weapon

38
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,460
It's the best weapon

39
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,460
Don't talk about the new disciples

40
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,460
Even the core disciples of Su Yan Li

41
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,460
I'm afraid there's only one

42
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,460
When the immortal ball falls

43
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,460
the battle will begin

44
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,460
I want to play with you

45
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,460
I'm not good enough for you

46
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,460
Go

47
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,460
Kill them

48
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,460
How good are you

49
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,460
Little flower pillow

50
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,460
You're a despicable person

51
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,460
You're a despicable person

52
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,460
Who do you want to trick

53
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,460
The way of battle

54
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,460
is not easy

55
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,460
I only talk about winning

56
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,460
no matter what

57
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,460
Welcome the snake cloth

58
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,460
Wuyi, good job

59
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,460
This is a big deal

60
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,460
It's a five-level battle

61
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,460
It's a big deal

62
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,460
It seems that Wuyi has at least

63
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,460
a battle of the five-level battle

64
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,460
As long as you help me defeat Wuyi

65
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,460
I'll give you two treasures

66
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,460
after you get the elixir

67
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,460
Really

68
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,460
I, Zhao Dan Long, will keep my word

69
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,460
I won't let you go

70
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,460
I don't believe you

71
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,460
Everyone, as long as you help me defeat Wuyi

72
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,460
and get the first one

73
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,460
I'm willing to give you the elixir

74
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,460
as a revenge

75
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,460
You mean the elixir

76
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,460
Take the money

77
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,460
and work hard

78
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,460
You're a despicable person

79
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,460
You're a despicable person

80
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,460
Four times the elixir

81
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,460
plus five times the elixir

82
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,460
Wuyi only has four times the elixir

83
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,460
Even if he has six times the elixir

84
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,460
I'm afraid he's going to lose

85
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,460
Zhao Dan Long has a lot of tricks

86
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,460
I think he's a lot of tricks

87
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,460
I think Wuyi has a lot of potential

88
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,460
Wuyi, are you going down the stage by yourself?

89
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,460
Or should we invite you down?

90
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,460
One more to one

91
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,460
Let's go together

92
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,460
If you have the courage, don't blame us

93
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,460
for being cruel

94
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,460
Zhao Shi's thirteen arrows

95
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,460
One sword is a cloud

96
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,460
Be careful

97
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,460
The feeling of being angry

98
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,460
is not good

99
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,460
Go down the stage and be naughty

100
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,460
Otherwise, your five organs and six organs

101
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,460
will be crushed

102
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,460
If you have the guts

103
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,460
I'll take you down

104
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,460
and see you die

105
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,460
Despicable

106
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,460
Please

107
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,460
You really want to fight us

108
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,460
I just can't stand you bullying people

109
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,460
Then let's see if your king is capable

110
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,460
to solve it

111
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,460
You don't have to help me

112
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,460
You saved me on the mountain

113
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,460
My king doesn't like to owe people

114
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,460
Cloudy sky

115
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,460
Three arrows fall into the clouds

116
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,460
Wuyi

117
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,460
Finally

118
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,460
What a bad weapon

119
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,460
It's in my ear

120
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,460
Wuyi

121
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,460
You pushed the weapon out of the body

122
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,460
You can't live

123
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,460
These arrows want to kill me

124
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,460
I'm far worse

125
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,460
Five-fold

126
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,460
He used the arrow to break the five organs and six organs

127
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,460
to the fifth part of the body

128
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,460
The extreme pain of the ten thousand arrows

129
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,460
can be tolerated

130
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,460
Wuyi is not a problem

131
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,460
Let go, stop him

132
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,460
You are a bunch of useless

133
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,460
You have been fighting me for so many years

134
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,460
You didn't even hurt Wuyi

135
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,460
You are useless

136
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,460
Money is not enough

137
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,460
You are a bunch of useless

138
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,460
Wuyi is empty

139
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,460
Open fire

140
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,460
Congratulations to Wuyi

141
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,460
You are the first

142
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,460
Great

143
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,460
I have my own style

144
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,460
In a year

145
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,460
Wuyi has finally entered the immortal gate

146
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,460
Don't worry

147
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,460
I will make them pay

148
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,460
I will make them pay

149
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,460
Where are you going

150
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,460
at this time

151
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,460
I prepared a small gift for him

152
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,460
I prepared a small gift for him

153
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,460
You are idle

154
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,460
Wuyi got the first place

155
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,460
This is a big news

156
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,460
Congratulations

157
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,460
You are good

158
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,460
I have a special weapon

159
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,460
I use a stick

160
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,460
From today

161
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,460
You are my disciple

162
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,460
Come with me

163
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,460
I will watch an old man from Yanli

164
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,460
Can I send him home first

165
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,460
Yes

166
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,460
Where is Sun Daojiu

167
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,460
It seems that Situ Jin took him back to the immortal garden

168
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,460
Old man

169
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,460
Sun Daojiu

170
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,460
Sun Daojiu

171
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,460
You still drink after you die

172
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,460
You are really a good person

173
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,460
You are really a good person

174
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,460
Old man

175
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,460
I am back

176
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,460
Situ Jin

177
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,460
You are really despicable

178
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,460
That little bastard should be very angry now

179
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,460
The more angry the better

180
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,460
I'm afraid that little bastard has no blood

181
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,460
I'm afraid that little bastard has no blood

182
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,460
What do you mean

183
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,460
I hope he makes me angry

184
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,460
It's better to kill a few more people

185
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,460
Then we can make a fair and just move on

186
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,460
Defend the rules of the clan

187
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,460
Defend the rules of the clan

188
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,460
Situ Jin

189
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,460
I want you to blood and blood

190
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,460
I want you to blood and blood

191
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,460
Eternal place trial

192
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,460
Eternal place trial

193
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,460
