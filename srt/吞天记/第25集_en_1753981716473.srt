1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:48,820
Huge

16
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,820
B Era

17
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,200
Oh!

18
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,200
He's gone!

19
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,160
Hey!

20
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,440
Hohohoho!

21
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,820
quite obvious

22
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,680
So I have a power over enough

23
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,560
I hope nothing will go wrong

24
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,280
Kiki

25
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,400
Such an absent Courts

26
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,240
only one thing can stop you

27
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,240
What's that?

28
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,360
I cannot go

29
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,160
No

30
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,400
Snot

31
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
Young Master.

33
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
Brother,

34
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
you don't have to worry about making me happy.

35
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
I'm fine by myself.

36
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
Young Master,

37
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,400
just look at her.

38
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Brother, I'm fine.

39
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,400
You don't have to...

40
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
Brother!

41
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,400
Brother,

42
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,400
you're dressed up to make me happy.

43
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,400
You're my real brother.

44
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,400
Young Master,

45
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,400
because...

46
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,400
Brother!

47
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,400
There's another one.

48
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,400
Brother, help!

49
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,400
She's a demon!

50
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
She's a demon!

51
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,400
I can't move.

52
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,400
There's no man in this world

53
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,400
who can escape from me.

54
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
Brother, let's go!

55
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,400
You're lucky today.

56
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,400
You two are the only ones

57
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,400
who can escape from me.

58
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
You brat!

59
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,400
You don't know if you're hit by a spell!

60
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
Protect your health!

61
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
Watch your heart!

62
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,400
She can get rid of my control of the power of the soul,

63
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,400
but she has a few abilities.

64
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,400
Unlike this little fatty,

65
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,400
she doesn't carry any burdens.

66
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,400
She's in the West City, cursing the heavens!

67
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,400
Let her go!

68
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400
You're so young and handsome,

69
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,400
yet you dare to show off in front of me.

70
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
Brother,

71
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,400
you're really not afraid of death?

72
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,400
You can still climb up?

73
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,400
I'll have to show you something amazing.

74
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,400
I'll take you to the sky!

75
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,400
Brother,

76
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
just give up.

77
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,400
You're no match for me.

78
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,400
It's...

79
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
so heavy...

80
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,400
Little Thing,

81
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
I'm...

82
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,400
You brat,

83
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,400
I've been practicing the Golden Armor for days.

84
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,400
You've got me a big favor to do.

85
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
What?

86
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,400
Golden Armor, change to the second form!

87
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,400
I'll use the Golden Armor!

88
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,400
This brat is so smart.

89
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,400
After he's done with his treasure hunt,

90
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,400
he might be able to break through the Seven Wings of the Nying Qi today.

91
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,400
He might be able to destroy the deep-seated old man

92
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,400
and make your dream come true!

93
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,400
He's got me a life.

94
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,400
Get out if you don't want to die!

95
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,400
You brat sure has a sharp tongue.

96
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,400
I didn't expect you to suffer so much.

97
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
You don't know how good my sister is.

98
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
I'll take you to the sky!

99
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
I'll use the Golden Armor!

100
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,400
You brat is quite capable.

101
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Cut the crap!

102
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
I'll take your life!

103
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
I'll use the Golden Armor!

104
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
I'll take your life!

105
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
Blood Moon Sting!

106
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,400
How come?

107
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,400
You're the only one I have.

108
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
You can't kill me.

109
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
Hongyi!

110
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
As long as the demon is strong,

111
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
no matter how strong the demon is,

112
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,400
you're nothing but a poor wooden object.

113
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
That's right.

114
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
And he can't kill us.

115
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,400
I'll kill him with my sword!

116
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,400
How dare you humiliate me in the Golden Pavilion?

117
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,400
I'll teach you a lesson!

118
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
Blood Moon Sting!

119
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,400
I'll use the Golden Armor!

120
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,400
I'll use the Golden Armor!

121
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,400
I'll use the Golden Armor!

122
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,400
You old bastard!

123
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
One day,

124
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
I'll make sure you die in a place where you can't be buried!

125
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
Since I can't kill you,

126
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
I'll cut your hands and feet

127
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
and make you suffer for the rest of your life!

128
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,400
No!

129
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
What's going on?

130
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,400
What's going on?

131
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,400
Zishi!

132
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
Hongyi!

133
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
Red Flame!

134
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,400
He's so skilled.

135
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,400
He's so skilled.

136
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,400
He's so skilled.

137
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
I'm afraid he has some kind of a legend.

138
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
I'm afraid he has some kind of a legend.

139
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,400
If he can get his hands on it,

140
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
I'm afraid he can get his hands on it.

141
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
Dragon Slash!

142
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
Ren Qianchi!

143
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,400
You bastard!

144
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
You're lucky this time.

145
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
If I see you again next time,

146
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,400
I'll suck your oxygen!

147
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,400
I thought you were so good.

148
00:07:51,400 --> 00:08:16,400
I knew you'd get away,

149
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,400
I knew you'd get away,

150
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,000
I just hate that you saved me

151
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and you still don't admit it.

152
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Whatever you think.

153
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Idiot, wake up.

154
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,400
Big brother, where's the fox demon?

155
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,400
It ran away.

156
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,800
Damn Wu Yu, how dare you defame me!

157
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,000
Next time, I will pull out your sword and skin!

158
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,600
Killing your peers is a big crime.

159
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
Shui Yue, are you really going to kill him?

160
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
You idiot.

161
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
No one will think you're dumb if you don't tell me.

162
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
I will tear your mouth apart sooner or later.

163
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,600
Chase!

164
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,600
These Martial Souls are all replaced by the beast.

165
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
I'll give them to you.

166
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,600
You can't live without the fox demon.

167
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,600
What Martial Soul is this?

168
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Why is the power so powerful?

169
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
I'm very interested in your new Martial Soul.

170
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,600
This Martial Soul is interesting.

171
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
I'm sorry.

172
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
I'm sorry.

173
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
I'm sorry.

174
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
I'm sorry.

175
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
I'm sorry.

177
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
I'm sorry.

178
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
I'm sorry.

179
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
I'm sorry.

180
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
I'm sorry.

181
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
I'm sorry.

182
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
I'm sorry.

183
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
I'm sorry.

184
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
I'm sorry.

185
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
I'm sorry.

186
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
I'm sorry.

187
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
I'm sorry.

188
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
I'm sorry.

189
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
I'm sorry.
