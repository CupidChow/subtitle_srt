1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,500
This really is too cruel!

16
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,000
Never mind.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Ezreal's music is already that bad?

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Well, use her music to make yourself happier.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I won't.

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm so sorry, you guys.

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Please sing some more.

22
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,000
Here we go.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,500
Let's go.

24
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,500
Show's over.

25
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,500
Tommy safe.

26
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,500
The mountain is lonely in the heart

27
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:05,500
The road ahead is not long, the wind is laughing, I am too crazy

28
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,500
The mountain is still strange, the heart is struggling

29
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,500
Only a little bit of the old house is left

30
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,500
I dare to break through the night

31
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,500
The wind, the snow, the moon, the people, the peach blossoms

32
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,500
The winter is over, there is a spring in the field

33
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,500
The night is over, the wind is laughing

34
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:30,500
Love and hate are hard to endure

35
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:37,500
The mountain is lost

36
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:44,500
The broken heart is broken

37
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:50,500
When you look back, the world is over

38
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,500
I'll give it to you

39
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,500
I'll beat you up

40
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,500
I dare to sell my skills in front of my grandmother

41
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,500
Double-edged sword

42
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,500
My clothes

43
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,500
The fire burned my clothes and I want to run

44
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,500
Stop for me

45
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,500
Don't hide if you can

46
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,500
You stole my magic and insulted me

47
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,500
I burned your clothes and we kissed

48
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,500
Who kissed you

49
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,500
Say it

50
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,500
How is it

51
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,500
I don't understand

52
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,500
It seems to be kissed

53
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,500
Kissed

54
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,500
You mean Wu Yu and Lan Shuiyue kissed

55
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,500
It seems to be what happened

56
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,500
I'll listen to it again

57
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,500
Congratulations, Junior Brother

58
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,500
You really have no back to open the devil

59
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,500
No back to open the devil

60
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,500
No back to open the devil

61
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
No back to open the devil

62
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,500
Thank you

63
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,500
Wu Yu, I can't be with you

64
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,500
You are dead

65
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
This

66
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,500
Did Lan Shuiyue be forced by Wu Yu

67
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,500
Which one

68
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
I

69
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,500
You are indeed the master's disciple

70
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,500
Powerful

71
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,500
Damn Wu Yu

72
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,500
Let him run

73
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Shuiyue, you are here

74
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,500
I

75
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,500
Sorry, I was wrong

76
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,500
Li Qingfeng, Zhao Chang Tian

77
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,500
You stop for me

78
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,500
Shuiyue, you are

79
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,500
Don't you want to protect me

80
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,500
Catch Wu Yu

81
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,500
Don't look at him

82
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,500
Wu Yu, you kid

83
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,500
Junior sister, rest assured

84
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,500
I will never let him go

85
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,500
And me Zhao Chang Tian

86
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,500
Nine dragon hajus

87
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,500
One sentence

88
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,500
Fireball

89
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,500
Fire dragon

90
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,500
No death

91
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,500
This is really powerful

92
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,500
If it is completely completed

93
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,500
Fire dragon

94
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Seven powers can't imagine

95
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,500
I want to say

96
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,500
You really haven't seen the world

97
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
Where is this power?

98
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,500
I can only say

99
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,500
It's far away from me

100
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,500
Wu Yu

101
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,500
Senior sister

102
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,500
Why are you here

103
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,500
I heard you kissed Lan Shuiyue

104
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,500
Is it

105
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,500
Where did you say that

106
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,500
Now the whole clan is rumored

107
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
You kissed Lan Shuiyue in the Wenda Tower

108
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,500
And said you

109
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,500
Say what

110
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,500
Say you are already married

111
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,500
Become a fairy

112
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,500
Nonsense

113
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,500
I won't kiss Lan Shuiyue

114
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,500
I won't be with her

115
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,500
Become a fairy

116
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,500
Master and Lan Huayun are not compatible

117
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Of course I don't want us

118
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,500
I have a relationship with his disciples

119
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,500
Moreover, Lan Shuiyue is too big

120
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,500
Not good for you

121
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
Don't communicate with him in the future

122
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,500
I just saw you practice the nine dragon hajus

123
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,500
If you want to test his power

124
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,500
I can be your opponent

125
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,500
Really

126
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,500
Come on

127
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,500
it is good

128
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,500
One dragon plate

129
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,500
Wu Yu

130
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,500
Are you okay

131
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
Senior sister is really a good dancer

132
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,500
I can't even hold one move

133
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,500
With your talent and effort

134
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,500
Plus the missing fairy roots

135
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
After that, it will surpass me and your brother Mo

136
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,500
Wu Yu

137
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,500
Lan Shuiyue

138
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,500
You shameless good-looking picture

139
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,500
I'll kill you today

140
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,500
Don't be so bold

141
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,500
Su Yanli, don't you dare to do anything

142
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,500
Wu Yu's rotten mouth is nonsense

143
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
Now the whole Bibo Qun Mountain is looking for him to kiss me

144
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
I'll make him pay for me today

145
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,500
When did I ever say kiss you

146
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,500
Did you hear

147
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,500
My junior brother doesn't like you

148
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Don't be so self-conceited

149
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,500
Want to die

150
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,500
Shuiyue

151
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
Shuiyue, are you okay?

152
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,500
What are you doing

153
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,500
Kill me

154
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,500
Wu Yu

155
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,500
You will destroy my junior sister

156
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,500
Today is a clear day

157
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,500
I must get justice for her

158
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,500
And I, Zhao Changtian

159
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Kill

160
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,500
Who is the emperor

161
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,500
Clouds down

162
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,500
Happy Xiong Feng

163
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
Send up

164
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,500
Mo Shishu

165
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Mo Shixiu

166
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,500
You are so blind

167
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,500
Mo Shishu

168
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,500
This has nothing to do with you

169
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,500
Feng Que, you'd better not interfere

170
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,500
You want to touch my junior brother and junior sister

171
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
I don't help

172
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Do you want to move the chair to watch the battle

173
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,500
Yi Qingfeng

174
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,500
Do you have a bag in your head?

175
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,500
You

176
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,500
Junior brother

177
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,500
Senior brother heard that

178
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,500
You put Lan Shuiyue

179
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Lan Shuiyue

180
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,500
That one

181
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Really

182
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,500
Who told you this version

183
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,500
ridiculous

184
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
My Fenghua and Xuefeng are all this

185
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
Junior sister, which version are you spreading?

186
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,500
No way

187
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,500
Lan Shuiyue

188
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,500
Let's find a place with more people

189
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Explain things clearly

190
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,500
Refine each other's innocence

191
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,500
Do you think

192
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,500
Shuiyue

193
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
Today Mo Shishu and Su Yanli are all here

194
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
I'm afraid we can't win

195
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Why don't you stop the rumors first

196
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,500
I'll find another chance to teach Wu Yu this kid

197
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,500
I'll give you a chance

198
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Go to the Dobao Valley

199
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,500
The teachers and the disciples of the family

200
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,500
Isn't it that water does not break the river?

201
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
Why are they together

202
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
I heard that Wu Yu and Lan Shuiyue are getting along

203
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,500
So their relationship is good

204
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
Not only did it get better

205
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
I heard that

206
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,500
Both of them are double-bride

207
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,500
Became an immortal

208
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,500
Shut up

209
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
I have nothing to do with Wu Yu

210
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,500
Who dares to talk nonsense

211
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,500
Don't blame me

212
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,500
Everyone

213
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
I have nothing to do with Lan Shuiyue

214
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,500
These days, the rumors are spreading

215
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
Please don't believe

216
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Don't worry, we understand

217
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
Yes, you two have nothing to do with it

218
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,500
We know it clearly

219
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,500
Wu Yu

220
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,500
They will believe if I kill you

221
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,500
The eternal trial

222
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
Immediately start

223
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,500
Today

224
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
The sword can't be cut

225
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,500
Brother Luo, you lure them over

226
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Let's kill them all together

227
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,500
Nie Kai Shanggu

228
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,500
The sword is broken

229
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
Meng Yi, Li En

230
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,500
One is not left

231
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,500
