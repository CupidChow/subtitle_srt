1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Ta train

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:51,000
immigrant

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The moon is full of stars, the mountains are lonely

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The road ahead is not smooth, the wind is laughing, I'm too crazy

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The mountain is still hanging, the heart is beating

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Only one side is as old as the old

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I dare to break through the night

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The wind, the snow, the moon, the people are all running away

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm afraid you'll be here in winter

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The evening sunset in the middle of the fall

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Love is hard to bear, hatred is hard to bear

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
In the night, the soul is lost

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The broken heart is broken

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You look back, the world is so beautiful

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
A Yi, you're a dog

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
A Qi

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
This is the ancient murderer of the second level of the soul, the Tien Tien Fae

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Fu Yue, you're dead this time

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Tien Tien Fae, kill him

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The god of death

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Everyone, run

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Don't cry, kid

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
When I finish solving these problems

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'll take you to eat sweet and spicy

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:40,240
Golden

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,760
You!

41
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,000
It's you!

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,200
Today is different from the past.

43
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,400
If you dare to disobey His Majesty again,

44
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,920
I'll catch you.

45
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
What the hell, Your Majesty?

46
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,920
I only know one His Majesty.

47
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,920
Shut up!

48
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,760
Let's get out of here.

49
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,200
Leave it to us soldiers.

50
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,800
What about the people?

51
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,600
I used to be

52
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,240
a soldier too.

53
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,000
How can you stop me

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,440
from guarding the family?

55
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,760
Dad, you're too old.

56
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,840
I always

57
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,760
practice a skill of running knives.

58
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,440
I have no place to use it.

59
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,040
Today, I'll try it with these beasts.

60
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,600
You talk more than me, old woman.

61
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,240
You...

62
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,720
Are you all so fierce?

63
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,600
Let's go.

64
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,320
We can't be weak as soldiers.

65
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,280
Kill them.

66
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:39,760
Yes.

67
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,360
Come on.

68
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,360
I'm still alive.

69
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,680
Don't you dare to make trouble in my Eastern Courtyard.

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,160
The beasts with three spirit energy and two-time mirror

71
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,440
are no match for him.

72
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,280
He's too strong.

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,720
Ayu, are you okay?

74
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,560
It's okay.

75
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,840
Let's get rid of this devil first.

76
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,440
You think you're a kid?

77
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,800
I'll kill you.

78
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,280
Three second and four minutes.

79
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,880
ormal strength results in

80
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,320
Hong yet.

81
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:34,440
ginseng

82
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,680
OH ohh

83
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,280
oh

84
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,760
MLJ

85
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,480
мор

86
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,480
I'm not afraid

87
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
You bastard

88
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,480
The firepower of this fire is not weaker than the three-dimensional fire

89
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,480
You can instantly turn into ashes

90
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,480
Quickly look at the star

91
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,480
I'll teach you a trick

92
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,480
Hang this fire

93
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,480
Nian Fan brain

94
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,480
You live and die

95
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,480
One hit

96
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,480
The big skill is strong

97
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,480
The moon is full of bones

98
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,480
The star is stuck in the body

99
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,480
A little boy who doesn't know how to count

100
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,480
What to fight with this fairy

101
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,480
It's killing me

102
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,480
That's right

103
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,480
Father is a three-dimensional mirror

104
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,480
Just rely on his physical ten times

105
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,480
How can it be a father's opponent

106
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,480
This time he is forced to die

107
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,480
Nian Fan brain

108
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,480
You live and die

109
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,480
One hit

110
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,480
The big skill is strong

111
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,480
The moon is full of bones

112
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,480
The star is stuck in the body

113
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,480
Nian Fan brain

114
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,480
You live and die

115
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,480
So strong power

116
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,480
The star is full of bones

117
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,480
The fire is full of bones

118
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,480
The star is stuck in the body

119
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,480
One hit

120
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,480
father

121
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,480
It's not good

122
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,480
That kid blocked the eye

123
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,480
Messy formation

124
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,480
Father, are you okay?

125
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,480
As long as you get the power of the sky

126
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,480
Everything can break the system

127
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,480
Only with the right path

128
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,480
You are also dead

129
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:28,480
You all love me

130
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
Haotian

131
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,480
I don't know how to read

132
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,480
You even killed your own child

133
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,480
You are so cruel

134
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,480
Poison

135
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,480
Isn't it called revenge?

136
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,480
I'll show you

137
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,480
You pay the price

138
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,480
Heaven's book

139
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,480
Don't want to get

140
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,480
Let the world feel the power of the spring

141
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,480
Let the world feel the power of the spring

142
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
Catch me

143
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,480
Little Su

144
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,480
You think you can force the level to the west

145
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,480
Can you beat me?

146
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,480
Dream

147
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,480
The god of death

148
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,480
The god of death

149
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,480
The god of death

150
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,480
