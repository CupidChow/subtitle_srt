00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,500
group

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Part Los

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,560
$

33
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:45,980
Ge .

34
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,260
Ge .

35
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,560
field

36
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,980
Field

37
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,040
Are you It was the same

38
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,880
Finally, the evil spirit of the evil spirit has come out.

39
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
It's time to sweep the dust away.

40
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,040
What's that?

41
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,920
Purple-red circle.

42
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,080
Only when the evil spirit breaks through,

43
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,520
it will trigger the world's eerie sound.

44
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,920
That direction is the West River.

45
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,960
Sister, take Master Dao to the secret room.

46
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,000
I'll go and find out.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,920
Be careful.

48
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,880
It's so late.

49
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,440
Where is the High Immortal going?

50
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,720
Oh my god.

51
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,800
It's so late.

52
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,280
What's the matter?

53
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,880
If you don't die,

54
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,440
I can't sleep.

55
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,680
It seems that you and Hao Tian are friends.

56
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,280
You've been practicing Taoism.

57
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,360
You're really good at it.

58
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,840
Sun Douzi,

59
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,880
I'm a noble immortal who is good at serving the country.

60
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,600
Don't interfere with my royal family.

61
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,480
You will die today.

62
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,680
Sister,

63
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,760
take Master Dao away.

64
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,600
It's not easy to die.

65
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,080
Nine, ten, ten.

66
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,480
Nine, ten, ten.

67
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,080
Ten percent of the body is broken,

68
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,080
but there is a strength of one percent of the soul.

69
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,160
You really can't underestimate it.

70
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,320
Today, I'll show you

71
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,040
the strength of the second percent of the soul.

72
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,400
Don't get close.

73
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,200
You are afraid of me?

74
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,520
revenues

75
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,600
blood

76
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,800
scrap

77
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,000
Do you want to die?

78
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,200
No.

79
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,000
嗯

80
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,040
I may as well die.

81
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,560
Bye.

82
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,760
Direction General домой, bring Huan IU back.

83
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,520
不专专

84
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,440
Wait for me to go to help.

85
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,520
Spread the Five Properties.

86
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,600
OK.

87
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,440
And then I must cut you off!

88
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,440
With Bangladesh Women!

89
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,760
We need more δαδί части!

90
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,720
Anya Wai!

91
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,680
No!

92
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:12,620
No!

93
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:12,840
No!

94
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:13,720
No!

95
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,420
Corner,

96
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,000
I will write to you!

97
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,540
paper doesn't

98
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,300
Why did you do this to me?

99
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,380
Look at me.

100
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,260
Who am I?

101
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,020
Wu Yu!

102
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,660
Xun Xi!

103
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,940
You killed my parents

104
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,140
and took the throne.

105
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,220
Did you expect this to happen?

106
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,780
Wan Qing, you useless woman!

107
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,500
I only hate you for not killing you with your own hands!

108
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,420
You and Hao Tianhao were together.

109
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,700
Did he also

110
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,340
take part in that?

111
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,020
So what if he did?

112
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,500
So what if he didn't?

113
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,140
You're just a dog in the dog's den now.

114
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,300
I thought you could defeat us.

115
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,580
If I kill you today,

116
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,580
I'll kill Hao Tianhao tomorrow.

117
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,780
I won't let you go

118
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,180
even if I have to die.

119
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,500
Naive.

120
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,220
After tonight,

121
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,220
I'll kill you

122
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,580
and the whole Zhengdao

123
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,700
without any consideration for Hao Tianhao.

124
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,620
You'll all die!

125
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,020
What do you mean?

126
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,900
You think I want the Eastern Courtyard

127
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,700
after I killed your parents?

128
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,780
What he wants

129
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,620
is not these.

130
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,900
It's the power to swallow the sky.

131
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,500
Only when thousands of people

132
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,300
use their flesh and blood to open the Big Swallow Formation

133
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,180
can they awaken the Swallow Formation.

134
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,620
That's why there are so many refugees in the capital.

135
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,900
So you're the ones who are cheating.

136
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,220
We'll all die!

137
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:55,740
Tell me.

138
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,060
Where is Hao Tianhao?

139
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,420
You want to know?

140
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,580
I won't tell you.

141
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,220
You and the whole city

142
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,140
will die!

143
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,820
Your useless parents

144
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,340
have been waiting for you for a long time.

145
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:14,980
I'll kill you!

146
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,100
Just turn your trick around!

147
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,260
Absorb the Great De J criminals!

148
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,740
Bullshit!

149
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,220
Your Highness.

150
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,220
You...

151
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,220
You...

152
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,220
You should have just died.

153
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,220
Please save Wu Yu.

154
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,220
Mother.

155
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,220
You should have given your life to your father.

156
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,220
He would have taken your life

157
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,220
and made you suffer more than death.

158
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,220
The Spring Spirit Order.

159
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,220
Is it right?

160
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,220
This is defective.

161
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,220
Spring Spirit Order?

162
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,220
The Spring Spirit Order is the power of the upper body.

163
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,220
It can remove all demons.

164
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,220
The power of blood loss to remove all demons

165
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,220
can wake up the evil monster, the Spring Spirit.

166
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,220
This is defective.

167
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,220
I'm afraid the people in Dongyue City

168
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,220
can't live longer than tonight.

169
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,220
The world is too complicated.

170
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,220
Why are they fighting for power?

171
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,220
It seems that the time has come.

172
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,220
It's okay.

173
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,220
That's the problem.

174
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,220
The Sword-Penny Tower is really problematic.

175
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,220
Go to guard the gate.

176
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,220
Don't let the monsters enter the city.

177
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,220
Go.

178
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,220
It's too dark.

179
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,220
Luo Yan Jun, the second team, is in danger.

180
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,220
Wait for my order.

181
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,220
Father.

182
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,220
Mother was killed by Wu Yu.

183
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,220
You have to avenge her.

184
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,220
Sun Dao Jiu is Wu Yu.

185
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,220
He will avenge her.

186
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,220
But don't worry, father.

187
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,220
I've already tied Wu You here.

188
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,220
The Daughter of Qi Yun

189
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,220
can't do much to the Sky Formation.

190
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,220
I'll kill you.

191
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,220
I'll kill you with my life.

192
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,220
I'll kill you, you bitch.

193
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,220
