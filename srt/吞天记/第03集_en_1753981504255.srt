1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Last time in the Alliance, I have let you off once.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This time,

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
take your people and leave quickly.

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Senior Su, after handling the private affairs,

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I will leave.

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You think I'm your family?

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You're being too harsh.

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I have a small thing to tell you.

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
My third brother is old.

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
He's already reached the peak of his body at the age of 13.

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The Master of the Five Cultes is very fond of my third brother.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Get lost!

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Thank you, High Immortal.

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Don't tell anyone about what happened last night.

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The Immortal's Way, the Immortal's Platform.

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
There will be three waves of monsters on the Immortal's Way.

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But the red fire will not escape the danger.

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Those who have not yet reached the Immortal's Way

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
can only go to the Immortal's Platform.

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What's so good about the garbage?

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
A bunch of garbage.

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
For a small qualification to enter the door,

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
you fight for yourself.

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Don't you think it's interesting?

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The Yanli Envoy's decree.

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This time, the Yanli Wind has a good idea.

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's a good person.

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
If you get the first place in the Immortal's Door Exam,

74
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'll buy that jar of snow wine for you for 30 years.

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's a deal.

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Old man, you grab it.

77
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm going to speed up.

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm a old man.

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Be brave.

80
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Hold on.

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The battle of the Immortal's Way

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
begins now.

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
This year, the competition is very intense.

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
No.

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Come on.

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Oh my god.

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Little rascal.

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You're brave today.

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm still a flower pot.

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You said that.

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Don't cry later.

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Have fun with them.

93
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You take me as a shield.

94
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Zhao Danlong, you shield me.

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Be careful.

96
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Thanks.

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Are you Wu Yu?

98
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
My name is Qingmeng.

99
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You're good at fighting.

100
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But why haven't I seen you before?

101
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Take care of yourself.

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What's the point of begging for snakes?

103
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I have a diamond mirror.

104
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You know it.

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The first place today is definitely my Qingmeng.

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Don't grab it.

107
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That's not for sure.

108
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Wu Yu was taught by Master Yanli.

109
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's mainly his own fault.

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
How can he be so good?

111
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's good.

112
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
If he died so easily in the test,

113
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I wouldn't see the big gift I prepared for him.

114
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I will be heartbroken.

115
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
This kid is not simple.

116
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Don't take it lightly.

117
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Brother Kang is so reliable.

118
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's very good.

119
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Your Highness.

120
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The sword is sharp and the white deer is the frost.

121
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The so-called one person in the water.

122
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Brother Kang, he bullied me.

123
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm a book.

124
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You dare to provoke my people.

125
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Brother Situ is serious.

126
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm just a flower, a well, a beauty.

127
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Save me.

128
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Not bad.

129
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You have a little bit of a similar style.

130
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The last test is the most dangerous.

131
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Let them explore.

132
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Kill them.

133
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Go.

134
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's a tough break.

135
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It can definitely withstand the five-fold sky.

136
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Go.

137
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Who can kill them?

138
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Come on.

139
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Be careful.

140
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
He's in the fourth round of the break.

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
He can kill them all at once.

142
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So powerful.

143
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
This woman is really strong.

144
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Where is Yunmu?

145
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You think you are me?

146
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You are a bad guy.

147
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Where is Yunmu?

148
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You think you are me?

149
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You are a bad guy.

150
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
He is imitating the part of the bloodless woman.

151
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Why are they all here?

152
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Mr. Mo, the woman is also here.

153
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Wind up.

154
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Flower road.

155
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The seventh final round.

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
We can't win.

157
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Stop.

158
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
The third round.

159
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
One sword, the cloud.

160
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The snake's cloth.

161
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The sword of the mountain.

162
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The cloud of blood.

163
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The sword of the mountain.

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Push.

165
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I must pass the test.

166
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
If I die...

167
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Your sword is broken.

168
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What kind of fight do you want?

169
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The cloud.

170
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
As long as I can find the weakest part of him.

171
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I can take him down with one move.

172
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You and the broken stick can still go up.

173
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,480
I wish I could be a gentleman

174
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Exterminating and un тяжELLT.

175
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
needle day TV

176
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Who will run the first one?

177
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's not Wu-yue.

178
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
If it's really him.

179
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It will be wonderful.

180
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's Wu-yue.

181
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Do you see it?

182
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I was howled by him.

183
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Old man Si, you must think about your future.

184
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's really a great success.

185
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
