1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,540
please come 좀下來

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Episode 16

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,500
Let's go.

18
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,000
Are you here to take us

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,500
to the Fairy Envoy Council?

20
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,000
The Fairy Envoy Council?

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,500
You don't even know the Fairy Envoy Council?

22
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,000
You're not sent by Mr. Bai.

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Mr. Bai said there were demons in the city last night.

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
He told us to stay here and not run around.

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
These two people...

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Are they demons?

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Fairy Envoy,

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
is Mr. Bai

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
the one who said that?

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Everyone,

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
we're not demons.

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
There are demons here.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We're here to save you.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Go away!

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We're not going anywhere

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
except for the Fairy Envoy Council.

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The voice came from over there.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Go over there.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yes.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Fairy Envoy,

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
go.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That Fairy Envoy Council

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
sounds strange.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's obviously for these refugees.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It seems that the refugees are looking for the Immortals

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
at this Fairy Envoy Council.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Where are the refugees that Princess saved?

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The Fairy Temple is three miles away from here.

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The Fairy Envoy wants to ask them about the Fairy Envoy Council.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Bring me there.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The Fairy Envoy, come with me.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You're useless!

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The demons you raised

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
should be replaced.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's time to replace them.

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Even a little Sun Dao Jiu

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
can't be solved.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Sun Dao Jiu is a spy of the Heaven-Slaying Sect.

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
If he dies,

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
the Feng Xue Cliff will investigate.

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
If you mess up my business,

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
who will take responsibility?

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Sun Dao Jiu's death

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
will only be the death of the demon-slaying demon.

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Feng Xue Cliff is not to be blamed for the Eastern Moon.

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Please rest assured.

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You underestimated Feng Xue Cliff.

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That old man is not easy to deal with.

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But it's okay.

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I've always been at your service.

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
How is the Fairy Envoy Council preparing?

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It will be held as scheduled tomorrow.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That's right.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
After the medicine is sent out,

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
those people will no longer be human.

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You must send people to take care of it.

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If you run out

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and are discovered by the Taoist,

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
things will be troublesome.

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I understand.

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Where are they?

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Why are they gone?

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The Fairy Envoy Council.

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Go to the Mirror Tower.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The Mirror Tower again?

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Why is he not hiding at all?

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Is he really serious?

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll go first.

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Don't be so stubborn.

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What are you doing?

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You old man.

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Don't be so stubborn.

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
This is...

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The Taoist.

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What?

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:20,540
A

97
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Where is the monster?

98
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Protect the Taoist.

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Monkey King.

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
How dare you?

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
How dare you mess up the Taoist Council?

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Kill him.

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
How dare you make trouble again?

104
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Aren't you that...

105
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You stinky head.

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You killed people again.

107
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Monkey King.

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Your fart is really not simple.

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
How dare you protect the monster?

110
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Come on.

111
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Take him down.

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
He is not a monster.

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You say it's not.

114
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Take him down.

115
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Stop.

116
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Who is it?

117
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Who is it?

118
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Who is it?

119
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Monkey King is saved.

120
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Isn't that...

121
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Isn't that the former guardian deity?

122
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Is this really the Taoist Council?

123
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
We thought too much before.

124
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Hao Tian.

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
How could it be him?

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Don't worry.

127
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Dongyue is not a monster.

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That's just a normal monkey.

129
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The auspicious time has come.

130
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Let's start.

131
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The fairy is about to lose her magic.

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Treat your illness.

133
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Stop.

134
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Stop.

135
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You are saved.

136
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Your illness is cured.

137
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You are saved.

138
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Thank you, fairy.

139
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's really a normal magic.

140
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Mr. Sun.

141
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
This is the fairy tree soul pill

142
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
that I sent to you by Hao Tian.

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It can cure hundreds of diseases.

144
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Please smile.

145
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Master.

146
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Does this thing really cure hundreds of diseases?

147
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Why don't you try it?

148
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
No, no.

149
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm just trying.

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Master, you...

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The jade qi is young and has a clear vein.

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's a magical pill.

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Hao Tian.

154
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What the hell is in your throat?

155
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Thank you, fairy.

156
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Sun Dao Jiu.

157
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
How can I let you see what you want to see?

158
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Master.

159
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Since this is a formal council,

160
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
is Yuan Xin really a good fairy?

161
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I can't see the problem yet.

162
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
But you'd better keep an eye on these refugees.

163
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
If anything happens, tell me immediately.

164
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yes.

165
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
God has come.

166
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
He is about to die.

167
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The heaven and earth are in place.

168
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The god of death is here.

169
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
God of heaven and earth, please help us.

170
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Kill them.

171
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's been three days since the auspicious time.

172
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's too late to change.

173
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You go to Dongyue quickly.

174
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Take back the daughter of Qiyun.

175
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I will bring Wu You back.

176
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Change her power of Qiyun.

177
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I wish Dongsheng country a long life.

178
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The eternal land trial will begin immediately.

179
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Today, the tea will not fly.

180
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Brother Luo, you lure them here.

181
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Let's kill them all together.

182
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
The god of death is here.

183
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The god of death is here.

184
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The five palaces are in harmony.

185
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The god of heaven is here.

186
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Meng Yi, Zi Yan, don't leave any of them.

187
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
The god of death is here.

188
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
The god of heaven is here.

189
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The god of death is here.

190
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The god of heaven is here.
