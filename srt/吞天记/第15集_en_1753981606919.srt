1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,500
Song of the Moon

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,600
Is this the pattern of communication between red and white?

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,480
I have the ingredients of red food and drinks with factories cooked to the bullets.

18
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,780
If there's magic in Yuyunsha Wanted to be a graduate at the end of the year.

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,940
I started to do it here.

20
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,940
Now I have nothing.

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,960
It's a big deal for you, huh?

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:04,960
I'm going to the mountains and the sea

23
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,960
I'm going to the mountains and the sea

24
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,960
I'm going to the mountains and the sea

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,960
I'm going to the mountains and the sea

26
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,960
I'm going to the mountains and the sea

27
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,960
I'm going to the mountains and the sea

28
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,960
I'm going to the mountains and the sea

29
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,960
I'm going to the mountains and the sea

30
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,960
I'm going to the mountains and the sea

31
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,960
I'm going to the mountains and the sea

32
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,960
I'm going to the mountains and the sea

33
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,960
I'm going to the mountains and the sea

34
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,960
I'm going to the mountains and the sea

35
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,960
Episode 1

36
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,960
The last time I lost, this time you die.

37
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,960
You kill him.

38
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,960
I?

39
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,960
I?

40
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,960
I?

41
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,960
I?

42
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,960
I?

43
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,960
I?

44
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,960
I?

45
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,960
I?

46
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,960
I?

47
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,960
I?

48
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,960
Didn't it stop?

49
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,960
Didn't it stop?

50
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,960
One.

51
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,960
One.

52
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,960
State of the Pro amenity.

53
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,600
crooked

54
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,960
crooked

55
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,960
crooked

56
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,960
mess

57
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,960
mess

58
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
I'll let you go.

59
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
Let me go.

60
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,960
Let you go?

61
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
Sure.

62
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,960
Go ask those people who were killed by you.

63
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,960
If they're willing to let you go,

64
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,960
I'll let you go.

65
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,960
You killed the people of Eastern God.

66
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,960
Have you asked your ancestors?

67
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
The evil demon, Gui,

68
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
has been killed by you.

69
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,960
The evil demon, Gui,

70
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,960
killed the innocent.

71
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,960
He deserves to die.

72
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Why should I ask you?

73
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
If you kill him,

74
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,960
you're an enemy to our Chihai Clan.

75
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,960
What's the point of

76
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,960
killing the demons?

77
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,960
Good.

78
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,960
Very good.

79
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,960
I'll remember this.

80
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,960
But...

81
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,960
He...

82
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,960
How dare he!

83
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,960
He deserves to die!

84
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,960
I told you just now.

85
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,960
Whoever makes trouble for me

86
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,960
will die.

87
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,960
I'll make you pay.

88
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,960
If you do,

89
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,960
I'll kill you.

90
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,960
I'll kill you.

91
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,960
Master.

92
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,960
It's late.

93
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,960
You're a good man.

94
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,960
Don't worry.

95
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,960
I won't tell His Highness.

96
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,960
But, Master.

97
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,960
I don't know who...

98
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,960
He was saved by the Five-Lore.

99
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,960
His parents...

100
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,960
You bastard!

101
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,960
You killed my people.

102
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,960
What do you think of the Eastern God?

103
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,960
You're so clumsy.

104
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,960
What do you think of

105
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,960
the princess's marriage?

106
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,960
You...

107
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
Master, be gentle.

108
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,960
Don't worry.

109
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,960
We've made a deal.

110
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,960
We'll stop them together.

111
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,960
Safety first.

112
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,960
I'll do it when it's necessary.

113
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,960
Thank you.

114
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,960
Is this the way of the immortals?

115
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,960
I'll do it when it's necessary.

116
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,960
No, no, no.

117
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,960
I'll do it when it's necessary.

118
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,960
Miss.

119
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,960
Can the Five-Lore survive?

120
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,960
If he dies under Sun Dao Jiu,

121
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,960
he won't survive.

122
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,960
But with my help,

123
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,960
he can survive.

124
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,960
I appreciate it.

125
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,960
If he's not useful,

126
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,960
I won't save him.

127
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,960
I'll teach him a good lesson.

128
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,960
But Sun Dao Jiu is a bad guy.

129
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,960
Just kill him.

130
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,960
No.

131
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,960
He's just a nine-year-old.

132
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,960
But he can't be easily moved by the Sword Sect.

133
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,960
You should take Wu You away as soon as possible.

134
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,960
As long as it's done,

135
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,960
the Sword Sect will be a dead end.

136
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,960
Take the carriage to the gate tomorrow.

137
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,960
He can't go.

138
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,960
Master, I...

139
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
I...

140
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,960
Go to sleep when you're sleepy.

141
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,960
I'm not sleepy at all.

142
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,960
You're just a stubborn person.

143
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,960
Master.

144
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,960
Don't stand on ceremony.

145
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,960
How can I do that?

146
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,960
All right, go back to your room and rest.

147
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,960
I have something to talk to you.

148
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,960
Ni Chang, you're weird.

149
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,960
You're just like when you were a kid.

150
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,960
I'm embarrassed to say that.

151
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,960
You two always make me worried.

152
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,960
What are you writing?

153
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,960
A plan to defeat Yuan Xi and her son.

154
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,960
I always think so far.

155
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,960
I've been telling you since I was a kid.

156
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,960
A person who is a son should be a man of his word.

157
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,960
Only then can...

158
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,960
Only then can he be a good leader.

159
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,960
You're a good leader.

160
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,960
I'm a good leader.

161
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,960
I'm a good leader.

162
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,960
Only then can he be a good leader.

163
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,960
He can be a good leader.

164
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,960
And...

165
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,960
How old are you?

166
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,960
Which one is so old?

167
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,960
This is the Sword-slaying Talisman.

168
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,960
It's more powerful than the power of Ning Qi Jing Yi Chong.

169
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,960
Sister, use it to defend yourself.

170
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,960
What's the use of you to use this magic treasure for me?

171
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,960
I have cultivation.

172
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,960
Sword-slaying Talisman can only be used to squeeze the sky.

173
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,960
Sister, don't worry.

174
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,960
When I have another cultivation,

175
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,960
I can definitely sweep away the evil ways of Dongsheng Kingdom.

176
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,960
After this trouble is over,

177
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,960
I will send Yuan Xi and her son back to my father's blood.

178
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,960
If you're still obsessed with me,

179
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,960
I don't mind blood-sucking the Gao Lin Army.

180
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,960
I can't let the Muzu and Ayu

181
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,960
fall into danger because of me.

182
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,960
Hey, you brat.

183
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,960
You're pretty fast today.

184
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,960
After a few more days,

185
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,960
you'll be able to use the magic.

186
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,960
It's not enough.

187
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,960
You can't reach it if you're fast.

188
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,960
