1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
fork

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,500
In the

17
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,900
mountain

18
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:57,000
sciences

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Episode 2

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Tomorrow,

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
that guy's barrier will be removed.

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
This is the experience Master gave me.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
With your level of breaking the ten-level,

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
the stupidness will rise again.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
After the test,

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'll arrange for you to leave.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Don't do anything that Second Brother didn't do.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Tomorrow,

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
use his life

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
to pay respects to my big brother.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Brother Kang,

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
is Xiao Yue much better today?

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The End

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's been a year.

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It seems that only you remember me.

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Sister Su.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This is the best dance school

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
that Master gave me.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You have time to practice more.

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Thank you, Head Coach.

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Thank you, Sister.

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Half a year ago,

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I tried to be successful in the age of old,

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and became a disciple of the Master of the Guardian.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You should be more careful.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I can't protect you.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Don't worry, Sister Su.

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I can handle it.

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Sister Su, wait.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I want to pay respects to Sun Bo.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Can you give me a ride?

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Then come with me.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Thank you, Sister Su.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Sister Qing, don't wait.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
When I go back,

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I have a lot of treasures there.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I promise you'll like them.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Sister Qing,

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
you look even better when you're angry.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It smells so good.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I love it.

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You didn't hit me.

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Sister Qing,

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
if you can catch up with me,

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'll do anything for you.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Wu Yu!

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Long time no see.

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I knew I could wait for you here.

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Give it back to me.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Where did you get a fierce and ugly monkey?

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
He is Wu Yu.

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Si Tu Ming Lang beat him for a year.

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
He can't live for three days.

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You're too high-handed.

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I guess it's only one day.

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
No, it's half a day.

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Shut up!

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Go away, you annoying guys.

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You bastard!

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I've been busy for half a year.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I didn't even get a single finger from Sister Qing.

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You're back and you're pulling my hand.

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
How dare you!

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Sister Qing,

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
when you're done with your brother's bravado,

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
don't be too obsessed with this.

87
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Brother Yu is a man of nine-fold.

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
He's good at fencing and martial arts.

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
He's also a top-notch martial artist.

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
He's a great fighter.

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Still fighting?

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Master Wu, please spare me.

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Please don't kill me.

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
If you dare to kill me again,

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll be sorry.

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yes, Master Wu.

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I won't do it again.

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Stop.

99
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Master Wu,

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
what else do you want me to do?

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I understand.

102
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I understand.

103
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I understand.

104
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I understand.

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I understand.

106
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I understand.

107
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Master Wu, don't worry.

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'll clean up right now.

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You two,

110
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
watch me.

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Brother Yu, let me help you.

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Hurry up.

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What's your level?

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
This stinky monkey is so annoying.

115
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Old man,

116
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm back to see you.

117
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
This is good wine.

118
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Try it.

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It must be stronger than the wine you make.

120
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
If you drink too much, you won't get drunk,

121
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
and you won't talk nonsense.

122
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You'll be reasonable.

123
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I finally feel quiet.

124
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But it's been a year

125
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and I feel a little too quiet.

126
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's you.

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I thought

128
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Situ Ming Lang would do it himself.

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Cut the crap.

130
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I want your name.

131
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Show me your face.

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You thief.

133
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
How dare you come to the school and do nothing?

134
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'll help you.

135
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You can try my ultimate martial arts.

136
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You're not my opponent.

137
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You're very sharp.

138
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Then I'll cut you into pieces.

139
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'll cut you into pieces.

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You brat.

141
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You're full of tricks.

142
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Don't let him get you.

143
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You're a powerful martial artist.

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Why are you willing to sacrifice your life for Situ Kang?

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Eighteen years ago,

146
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
he saved my life.

147
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
One year ago, you killed him.

148
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Today, I'll kill you.

149
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You're a bad girl.

150
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'll take you as my slave.

151
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You're a bad girl.

152
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You're a bad girl.

153
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Go back and tell Situ Ming Lang

154
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
that I'll wait for his fight at any time.

155
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'll kill you.

156
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Be careful.

157
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Be careful.

158
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
With so many hidden weapons,

159
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
the King of Qin can't even avoid them.

160
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And this fire in the alley.

161
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's not even a little bit.

162
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You brat.

163
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
When did you start to like playing with fire?

164
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Get out.

165
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Don't burn my house.

166
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'll kill you.

167
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'll kill you.

168
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'll kill you.

169
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Why did he suddenly get out of the house?

170
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You can't kill me.

171
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Stop being obsessed.

172
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I don't know where to go.

173
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Peach blossoms are already falling.

174
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Little Spring Wind.

175
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Little Spring Wind.

176
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm very interested in your new Martial Soul.

177
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
This is Martial Soul.

178
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's interesting.

179
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm going to kill you.

180
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm going to kill you.

181
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm going to kill you.

182
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm going to kill you.

183
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm going to kill you.

184
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm going to kill you.

185
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm going to kill you.

186
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm going to kill you.

187
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm going to kill you.

188
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm going to kill you.

189
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
