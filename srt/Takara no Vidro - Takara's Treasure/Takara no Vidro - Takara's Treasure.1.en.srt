1
00:00:46,616 --> 00:00:48,248
You didn't forget anything, right?

2
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:50,176
Don't get lost, baby.

3
00:00:51,293 --> 00:00:52,490
Don't worry.

4
00:00:52,611 --> 00:00:55,810
Once you go to university,
you must make friends first.

5
00:00:56,196 --> 00:00:58,710
Don't hang out with the wrong crowd.

6
00:01:00,236 --> 00:01:03,350
Understood. Thank you, Mom.

7
00:01:04,122 --> 00:01:05,122
Bye.

8
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,404
Stationary.

9
00:01:17,201 --> 00:01:18,641
Notebooks.

10
00:01:20,816 --> 00:01:22,951
Student ID.

11
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:28,067
(Nakaba University
Nakano Taishin)

12
00:01:30,506 --> 00:01:33,030
I finally found you.

13
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,364
Okame-kun,

14
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:46,260
I'll do my best.

15
00:01:47,215 --> 00:01:49,420
Please watch over me.

16
00:01:56,847 --> 00:01:59,698
Don't just stand there.

17
00:01:59,983 --> 00:02:02,723
Keep your hands in front of you.

18
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:06,139
Oh, I'm sorry.

19
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,955
For attendance, to be counted,

20
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,266
you must be in the classroom
ten minutes before the buzzer.

21
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,793
The orientation is boring.

22
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:25,400
At least take the first day seriously.

23
00:02:25,537 --> 00:02:28,984
Hey, let's go to a coffee shop
after class. There's a new place.

24
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,217
- In Shibuya?
- Yes.

25
00:02:30,341 --> 00:02:31,848
- Let's.
- Not bad.

26
00:02:32,147 --> 00:02:34,318
Central dialect.

27
00:02:34,817 --> 00:02:37,654
Don't hang out with the wrong crowd.

28
00:02:38,474 --> 00:02:42,775
What's considered the wrong crowd?

29
00:02:42,786 --> 00:02:44,580
That's the end of the orientation.

30
00:02:45,112 --> 00:02:46,175
Thank you, everyone.

31
00:02:46,214 --> 00:02:48,519
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

32
00:02:49,415 --> 00:02:51,210
- I get what you mean.
- Uh...

33
00:02:51,235 --> 00:02:53,815
Let's change it up.

34
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:56,447
You've got a great idea.

35
00:03:04,745 --> 00:03:07,590
- Wanna to join our club?
- We'll wait.

36
00:03:07,615 --> 00:03:09,315
Feel free to come.

37
00:03:09,326 --> 00:03:11,239
Wanna join Film Study Club?

38
00:03:11,263 --> 00:03:15,399
Is that person around here?

39
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:18,080
Hey, wanna join Hiking Club?

40
00:03:19,134 --> 00:03:21,705
(A Camp to Experience the Hiking Club)

41
00:03:21,903 --> 00:03:25,140
- Hiking?
- Oh? You're interested?

42
00:03:26,154 --> 00:03:27,154
Yes.

43
00:03:27,526 --> 00:03:30,016
My hometown has a lot of mountains.

44
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:33,380
Oh, you speak a dialect.
Where are you from?

45
00:03:33,405 --> 00:03:34,801
Wait, let me guess.

46
00:03:35,432 --> 00:03:37,612
Hiroshima. No. Tokushima.

47
00:03:37,637 --> 00:03:38,999
- You're babbling.
- I'm not.

48
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,703
What's the mountain near your house?

49
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:43,332
Uh...

50
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,542
Oh, you know each other?

51
00:04:27,536 --> 00:04:28,659
No.

52
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:33,111
Would you...

53
00:04:33,771 --> 00:04:36,065
please say something?

54
00:04:41,203 --> 00:04:42,617
A, B, C,

55
00:04:43,614 --> 00:04:46,136
D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N.

56
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,415
Seriously?

57
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,665
You can't do that.

58
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,101
More.

59
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,255
Would you finish it?

60
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,826
- To Z?
- You want tone marks too?

61
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,880
Tone marks too.

62
00:04:58,891 --> 00:05:00,101
He wants tone marks too.

63
00:05:00,112 --> 00:05:01,987
No, it's annoying.

64
00:05:05,701 --> 00:05:07,313
What's wrong, Tiny?

65
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:13,709
What's wrong, Tiny?

66
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:18,480
I finally found you.

67
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,682
My name is...

68
00:05:22,861 --> 00:05:24,801
Nakano Taishin.

69
00:05:26,374 --> 00:05:27,374
Uh...

70
00:05:28,325 --> 00:05:32,112
You comforted me in Fukuoka last year.

71
00:05:35,941 --> 00:05:37,110
Ah!

72
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:39,879
You're the one who was crying?

73
00:05:40,983 --> 00:05:44,728
I wanted to see you again,
so I applied to this university.

74
00:05:45,743 --> 00:05:46,743
So?

75
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:49,933
Eh?

76
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:53,620
You said you came
all the way here to find me.

77
00:05:54,031 --> 00:05:56,086
Now that you found me, what's next?

78
00:05:57,001 --> 00:05:59,526
You think you owe me. It's annoying.

79
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:02,310
Annoying?

80
00:06:02,335 --> 00:06:06,120
It's creepy enough you picked
this school over that nonsense.

81
00:06:08,547 --> 00:06:09,547
I'm gonna go.

82
00:06:14,418 --> 00:06:16,353
Okame-kun...

83
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:23,467
He called me annoying and creepy.

84
00:07:04,556 --> 00:07:10,049
"Takara's Treasure"

85
00:07:15,013 --> 00:07:18,655

86
00:07:38,769 --> 00:07:40,769
(How's the university?)

87
00:07:42,585 --> 00:07:44,935
You're okay, Taishin.

88
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:51,860
You're okay, Taishin.

89
00:07:52,218 --> 00:07:54,487
You're okay, Taishin.

90
00:07:55,313 --> 00:07:57,826
Thanks, Okame-kun.

91
00:08:02,369 --> 00:08:07,689
"A Camp to Experience the Hiking Club."

92
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:13,428
That's it.

93
00:08:20,273 --> 00:08:22,431
Oh, the kid from the other day.

94
00:08:23,263 --> 00:08:25,893
- Yes.
- I'm glad you came.

95
00:08:25,925 --> 00:08:28,831
You were insulted the other day.
I've been worried.

96
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,039
What about that senior?

97
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,222
Oh, he's over there.

98
00:08:35,247 --> 00:08:37,247
- He's so cool.
- So handsome.

99
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:42,068
Damn it. He's still popular this year.

100
00:08:42,093 --> 00:08:46,057
I'm sick of people who came for him
and not for the mountain.

101
00:08:46,082 --> 00:08:49,206
Didn't you join our club
last year for Takara too?

102
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,808
Yes. Do you have a problem?

103
00:08:51,796 --> 00:08:53,356
Takara?

104
00:08:53,381 --> 00:08:55,710
Eh? You didn't know his name?

105
00:08:57,334 --> 00:08:58,599
Shiga Takara.

106
00:08:58,624 --> 00:09:01,280
Written with a kanji character
for "treasure."

107
00:09:03,866 --> 00:09:07,283
Shiga Takara.

108
00:09:09,027 --> 00:09:10,644
You came too?

109
00:09:12,106 --> 00:09:13,106
Yes.

110
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,980
After I turned you down harshly.
You have balls.

111
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:19,334
Well...

112
00:09:20,091 --> 00:09:23,005
I still wanted to thank you.

113
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:25,593
Once I got to thank you...

114
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,694
I'll...

115
00:09:30,292 --> 00:09:32,726
Fine. I'll hear you out.

116
00:09:34,563 --> 00:09:36,578
But only on the summit.

117
00:09:37,897 --> 00:09:42,070
- Eh?
- Wait, Takara. Hear him out.

118
00:09:42,587 --> 00:09:43,923
I'm taking off now!

119
00:09:43,948 --> 00:09:45,221
Follow me!

120
00:09:45,245 --> 00:09:46,260
- Yes.
- Yes.

121
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,276
I guess you have to try
to get to the summit.

122
00:09:56,005 --> 00:09:57,095
Eh?

123
00:10:13,692 --> 00:10:16,076
Is this really the trail for beginners?

124
00:10:16,101 --> 00:10:18,999
I didn't know it'd be this tough.

125
00:10:19,127 --> 00:10:21,352
Let me know if you give up!

126
00:10:21,385 --> 00:10:23,641
I'll walk you down.

127
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,889
I give up. I can't go on.

128
00:10:26,914 --> 00:10:28,433
Me too.

129
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:33,380
Our "shedding plan"
works as usual this year.

130
00:10:33,405 --> 00:10:37,120
Because girls who came
for Senior Takara usually give up here.

131
00:10:37,145 --> 00:10:41,800
So the people left are either really
love hiking or are really into Takara.

132
00:10:41,825 --> 00:10:43,639
I managed last year.

133
00:10:44,317 --> 00:10:46,617
Of course the winner would boast.

134
00:10:49,792 --> 00:10:51,361
We're taking a break up ahead?

135
00:10:51,386 --> 00:10:53,610
Yes. Let's go a little further.

136
00:10:53,635 --> 00:10:54,635
- Mm.
- Mm.

137
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,446
Male fern.

138
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,261
A lot of people gave up.

139
00:11:13,286 --> 00:11:14,725
You're right.

140
00:11:23,468 --> 00:11:25,328
Japanese mugwort.

141
00:11:26,178 --> 00:11:27,710
Viola mandshurica.

142
00:11:29,761 --> 00:11:31,789
Bittercress.

143
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:53,890
Amazing.

144
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,409
Pitch your tents before it gets dark.

145
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,527
- Yes.
- Yes.

146
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,248
- Akira, drive the tent pegs.
- Okay.

147
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:13,946
We reached the summit.

148
00:12:14,356 --> 00:12:16,316
But when should I thank him?

149
00:12:16,341 --> 00:12:17,415
Wait up.

150
00:12:19,535 --> 00:12:20,744
Sorry.

151
00:12:22,317 --> 00:12:23,712
It's okay.

152
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:25,936
Please watch your step.

153
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,797
Eh, what did you say?

154
00:12:29,656 --> 00:12:31,936
No, nothing.

155
00:12:33,036 --> 00:12:34,048
Is that so?

156
00:12:34,273 --> 00:12:36,116
- Let's go.
- Sorry.

157
00:12:42,556 --> 00:12:44,024
Ow.

158
00:12:57,906 --> 00:13:00,067
The night's still young.

159
00:13:07,357 --> 00:13:10,665
I can't approach him and thank him now.

160
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:20,273
Eh?

161
00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:23,134
Let me see your leg.

162
00:13:27,551 --> 00:13:28,700
Ow.

163
00:13:35,464 --> 00:13:37,336
You really sprained it.

164
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,979
Why didn't you say anything?

165
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,930
You could've told your tentmate.

166
00:13:49,857 --> 00:13:51,687
Well, you were...

167
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:55,337
far away.

168
00:13:57,575 --> 00:13:59,395
You didn't have to tell me.

169
00:14:00,203 --> 00:14:01,343
Are you dumb?

170
00:14:06,037 --> 00:14:07,231
Well, I...

171
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,341
speak a dialect.

172
00:14:11,881 --> 00:14:14,574
People might not have understood me.

173
00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:17,236
They would have.

174
00:14:19,812 --> 00:14:22,406
Like right now.
We understand each other.

175
00:14:24,382 --> 00:14:25,382
Eh?

176
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,760
I know a lot of things worry you.

177
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,882
But try not to overthink.

178
00:14:37,212 --> 00:14:38,539
Senior...

179
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,385
You really are kind.

180
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:48,237
Just like back then.

181
00:14:51,118 --> 00:14:52,408
Back then?

182
00:15:02,692 --> 00:15:04,432
What's wrong, Tiny?

183
00:15:07,671 --> 00:15:09,021
Isn't this a little overkill?

184
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,608
I walked past here during the day.

185
00:15:16,086 --> 00:15:17,429
You've just been sitting here?

186
00:15:26,819 --> 00:15:31,772
I'm not allowed to talk to strangers.

187
00:15:33,874 --> 00:15:35,918
I'm just a tourist.

188
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,935
I came here to hike.

189
00:15:38,455 --> 00:15:40,120
I'm about to leave.

190
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,895
So...

191
00:15:47,727 --> 00:15:48,727
What happened?

192
00:15:51,358 --> 00:15:53,816
I can't leave with this on my mind.

193
00:15:57,792 --> 00:15:59,134
What's hurting you?

194
00:16:04,743 --> 00:16:06,605
The parrot I kept...

195
00:16:08,088 --> 00:16:09,864
He's dead.

196
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,390
He was a very talkative bird.

197
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:24,515
But I don't hear his voice
in my house anymore.

198
00:16:31,898 --> 00:16:33,983
I hate not hearing anything.

199
00:16:35,448 --> 00:16:36,448
I hate it.

200
00:16:39,181 --> 00:16:40,501
It's torture.

201
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:45,329
Is that so?

202
00:16:48,936 --> 00:16:52,525
To lose a family member, it's torture.

203
00:16:57,597 --> 00:16:58,936
Still,

204
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:02,012
we must keep living our lives.

205
00:17:03,924 --> 00:17:05,716
We must move on.

206
00:17:11,345 --> 00:17:12,481
Move on...

207
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:27,384
Okame-kun...

208
00:17:29,202 --> 00:17:32,461
would have wanted me to do that.

209
00:17:36,258 --> 00:17:37,387
I agree.

210
00:17:41,408 --> 00:17:43,001
So you should go home.

211
00:17:44,754 --> 00:17:46,161
Your family...

212
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:50,504
Did they let you come out here
and cry alone without caring?

213
00:17:52,247 --> 00:17:53,369
They didn't.

214
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,250
Is that so?

215
00:18:00,588 --> 00:18:02,322
So you'll be okay.

216
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,290
I'll be okay?

217
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:12,466
Mm.

218
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:17,635
You'll be okay eventually.

219
00:18:23,346 --> 00:18:25,582
I'll walk you home
when you're done crying.

220
00:18:27,434 --> 00:18:28,475
Mister?

221
00:18:32,405 --> 00:18:35,994
Where are you from?

222
00:18:38,626 --> 00:18:39,760
Tokyo.

223
00:18:40,694 --> 00:18:45,094
I'm a student at Nakaba University.

224
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:50,687
What happened back then...

225
00:18:52,545 --> 00:18:54,555
help me come to terms with...

226
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,740
Okame-kun's death.

227
00:19:01,511 --> 00:19:03,532
Thank you.

228
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:12,050
Even though it might be trivial to you.

229
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:17,554
I'm starting to remember things.

230
00:19:18,476 --> 00:19:20,789
I thought you were in junior high.

231
00:19:21,339 --> 00:19:22,339
Eh?

232
00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:25,169
So...

233
00:19:28,173 --> 00:19:30,001
are you happy you got to thank me?

234
00:19:32,524 --> 00:19:33,948
Deep down...

235
00:19:35,011 --> 00:19:37,151
what did I really want

236
00:19:38,698 --> 00:19:41,940
after finding this person?

237
00:19:54,104 --> 00:19:55,707
Actually...

238
00:19:59,238 --> 00:20:01,238
I wanted to...

239
00:20:02,442 --> 00:20:05,392
be closer to you.

240
00:20:08,116 --> 00:20:09,474
Closer?

241
00:20:19,072 --> 00:20:21,072
Close enough to hear your voice,

242
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:26,026
to touch your hands.

243
00:20:30,123 --> 00:20:31,664
That's creepy.

244
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:35,344
I think you'll be okay.

245
00:20:36,981 --> 00:20:38,600
Thank you very much.

246
00:20:38,836 --> 00:20:42,298
Just go to sleep and elevate your foot.

247
00:20:43,514 --> 00:20:44,565
I will.

248
00:20:48,176 --> 00:20:49,396
So you...

249
00:20:51,861 --> 00:20:53,545
like mountains?

250
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,045
Eh?

251
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:57,355
Well,

252
00:20:58,276 --> 00:21:01,018
I noticed you were
knowledgeable about plants.

253
00:21:02,744 --> 00:21:08,230
I loved hanging out
on the mountain near my house.

254
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,833
That's why I love mountains.

255
00:21:24,635 --> 00:21:29,557
That was the first time he smiled at me.

256
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:40,607
I got to talk a lot to Senior Takara.

257
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:45,159
If Okame-kun were here...

258
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,421
Taishin, great job!

259
00:21:49,895 --> 00:21:52,082
He would have said that.

260
00:22:09,877 --> 00:22:11,424
What a beautiful day.

261
00:22:11,449 --> 00:22:12,849
Good morning.

262
00:22:13,048 --> 00:22:14,139
Good morning.

263
00:22:14,693 --> 00:22:18,166
Oh, you were with us at the orientation.

264
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,215
You noticed me?

265
00:22:20,985 --> 00:22:23,160
Eh, you hurt your foot? Are you okay?

266
00:22:24,456 --> 00:22:28,760
I sprained my ankle a little,
but I'm okay now.

267
00:22:29,573 --> 00:22:32,706
Yeah? If you run into trouble,
you can let us know.

268
00:22:33,381 --> 00:22:34,904
Oh, well...

269
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,758
So you understand what I'm saying?

270
00:22:39,354 --> 00:22:40,584
Of course we do.

271
00:22:40,805 --> 00:22:42,726
That's a relief.

272
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,141
You're so cute.

273
00:22:46,121 --> 00:22:47,694
Let's walk to class together.

274
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:48,440
Mm.

275
00:22:49,123 --> 00:22:50,123
Let's go.

276
00:22:51,376 --> 00:22:54,307
It's exactly like he told me.

277
00:22:55,267 --> 00:22:59,524
From now on, I should be
able to survive in Tokyo.

278
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:05,113
Takara, what's wrong?

279
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:08,834
Nothing.

280
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:13,825
(Next episode)
Looks like the sky's in there, right?

281
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:17,800
They say last year's Miss Nakaba
has her eye on Senior Takara.

282
00:23:17,825 --> 00:23:19,700
Don't be too trusting.

283
00:23:19,725 --> 00:23:23,690
You're not alone, Senior.
I wanted you to know that.

284
00:23:27,176 --> 00:23:31,180
Is he going to date her?

285
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:34,860
Because someone who seems kind
might not really be kind.
