"Takara's Treasure"
(Episode 5)

2
00:01:38,972 --> 00:01:40,622
(Examination time 10.30-12.00)

3
00:01:40,647 --> 00:01:44,863
During the first exams
since I started university,

4
00:01:46,512 --> 00:01:50,434
even though things are chaotic
and time passes very quickly,

5
00:01:52,235 --> 00:01:54,810
I managed to survive.

6
00:01:54,835 --> 00:01:55,786
(Hiking Club)

7
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,129
I'll give you details in the group chat.

8
00:01:59,154 --> 00:02:01,671
See you at the meeting
after school starts.

9
00:02:02,138 --> 00:02:04,192
Thank you for today!

10
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:06,307
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

11
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:11,312
Thank you for today.

12
00:02:11,337 --> 00:02:12,716
Thank you for today.

13
00:02:14,153 --> 00:02:15,153
Wait a minute.

14
00:02:16,073 --> 00:02:18,305
I won't see Senior Takara for a month.

15
00:02:19,412 --> 00:02:21,652
How will I survive?

16
00:02:23,254 --> 00:02:24,797
That's right.

17
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:30,855
I won't see him for a while.

18
00:02:31,538 --> 00:02:34,283
Takara, are you hiking
with your grandfather again this year?

19
00:02:34,693 --> 00:02:37,363
Mm, I'll be on a flight
the night after tomorrow.

20
00:02:37,388 --> 00:02:39,718
So how long will you
be gone this time?

21
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,451
Two weeks.

22
00:02:41,476 --> 00:02:45,027
I wanna try hiking abroad so bad.

23
00:02:45,052 --> 00:02:47,648
My parents have been
pestering me to come home.

24
00:02:47,673 --> 00:02:51,255
That's what parents do.
It means you're their favorite.

25
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,093
But the bullet train is expensive.

26
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,740
I'm going home next month too.

27
00:02:54,765 --> 00:02:56,411
Really? How?

28
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:03,793
Uh, Senior.

29
00:03:06,704 --> 00:03:07,704
What?

30
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:10,002
Well...

31
00:03:13,381 --> 00:03:15,059
Is everything okay?

32
00:03:18,707 --> 00:03:20,438
Uh, it's just...

33
00:03:21,358 --> 00:03:23,991
you seem different.

34
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:36,367
Hey, Takara.

35
00:03:36,392 --> 00:03:37,832
Let's eat on our way home.

36
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,069
- Mm, sure.
- What should we get?

37
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:43,740
- Ramen.
- Ramen again?

38
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:51,497
How were the exams?

39
00:03:51,528 --> 00:03:52,711
Did you ace them?

40
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:58,128
Of course I did. I studied my butt off.

41
00:03:58,325 --> 00:03:59,367
Great.

42
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:02,925
Oh, when will you come home?

43
00:04:03,703 --> 00:04:04,703
Uh...

44
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,672
I promised my friends
we'd go on a trip together.

45
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:11,817
I might be able to come home next month.

46
00:04:12,495 --> 00:04:13,495
Yeah?

47
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,455
Your dad and Chizuru miss you.
Please at least show your face.

48
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:19,629
Mm.

49
00:04:27,346 --> 00:04:28,517
Let's eat.

50
00:04:59,154 --> 00:05:01,541
(Takara:
Are you taking cultural sociology?

51
00:05:01,566 --> 00:05:02,566
(Taishin: I am.)

52
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,681
(Takara: sent file)

53
00:05:03,706 --> 00:05:04,765
(Taishin: Thank you.)

54
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,298
I'm so free.

55
00:05:18,812 --> 00:05:21,387
There's nothing to do.

56
00:05:21,815 --> 00:05:23,371
Where have you been to lately?

57
00:05:23,694 --> 00:05:27,172
Oh, Akira-kun and I went to...

58
00:05:27,197 --> 00:05:28,320
What? On a date?

59
00:05:28,437 --> 00:05:29,437
Mm.

60
00:05:31,971 --> 00:05:33,820
Don't tell me that was...

61
00:05:33,845 --> 00:05:34,655
Ruirui.

62
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,315
Really? He's already back to work?

63
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:41,015
Yes, he's in a musical. It's super cool.

64
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,317
I'm happy for you.

65
00:05:47,605 --> 00:05:48,621
Oh.

66
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:50,828
Hm? What's the matter?

67
00:05:51,426 --> 00:05:54,928
My club's gonna play sparklers.

68
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,923
Oh, Akira-kun told me that.

69
00:05:57,045 --> 00:05:58,794
Non-club members can join.

70
00:05:58,818 --> 00:06:00,567
Sounds fun. Shall we go?

71
00:06:00,592 --> 00:06:01,673
Mm, what day?

72
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,210
Let me check.

73
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,668
Will he come?

74
00:07:05,876 --> 00:07:06,876
Hello?

75
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,920
Mm.

76
00:07:09,828 --> 00:07:11,078
I just got home.

77
00:07:15,671 --> 00:07:17,276
Don't worry.

78
00:07:17,795 --> 00:07:19,602
I'm not a kid anymore.

79
00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:27,699
Next time's probably the winter break.

80
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,709
Mm. Bye.

81
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:50,417
(Taishin: I'll come.)

82
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,950
Hm?

83
00:08:57,464 --> 00:09:00,222
You don't usually
come to play sparklers.

84
00:09:00,247 --> 00:09:01,586
Leave me alone.

85
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,403
Put all of them in this?

86
00:09:03,428 --> 00:09:05,888
That's right. We'll add ice later.

87
00:09:10,225 --> 00:09:11,225
Hm?

88
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:13,150
The shrine?

89
00:09:13,356 --> 00:09:14,974
Eh? What's the matter?

90
00:09:26,697 --> 00:09:27,697
Excuse me.

91
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:30,492
Did you come alone?

92
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,178
Where's your mom?

93
00:09:34,852 --> 00:09:37,207
What's your name?

94
00:09:40,066 --> 00:09:43,365
Uh, my name is Nakano Taishin.

95
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:47,953
We shouldn't tell strangers our name.

96
00:09:51,793 --> 00:09:53,253
I'm sorry.

97
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:56,090
Well, it's just...

98
00:09:58,232 --> 00:10:00,106
What are you doing?

99
00:10:00,131 --> 00:10:02,173
Oh, Senior Takara.

100
00:10:02,431 --> 00:10:03,679
How did you get here?

101
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,706
I should be asking you that.
This is not the assembly area.

102
00:10:06,717 --> 00:10:08,386
Eh? Really?

103
00:10:13,349 --> 00:10:14,372
What's up?

104
00:10:14,602 --> 00:10:15,602
Are you lost?

105
00:10:15,798 --> 00:10:16,936
I'm not lost.

106
00:10:18,774 --> 00:10:20,815
I ran away from home.

107
00:10:22,713 --> 00:10:23,713
Eh?

108
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:36,240
Mom said she'd play with me today,
but she broke her promise.

109
00:10:38,117 --> 00:10:39,139
Is that so?

110
00:10:39,957 --> 00:10:41,487
That's a shame.

111
00:10:43,171 --> 00:10:44,825
I hate my mom.

112
00:10:46,764 --> 00:10:48,454
She must be worried about you.

113
00:10:48,993 --> 00:10:51,464
She obviously puts her work before me.

114
00:11:04,395 --> 00:11:06,395
(Ramune)

115
00:11:06,862 --> 00:11:08,072
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

116
00:11:08,097 --> 00:11:09,715
- Three Ramunes, please.
- Sure.

117
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,864
Three hundred yen.

118
00:11:13,812 --> 00:11:15,589
- Here.
- Okay. No change.

119
00:11:18,222 --> 00:11:19,390
Here you go.

120
00:11:19,415 --> 00:11:20,606
- Thank you.
- Sure.

121
00:11:26,576 --> 00:11:27,896
Here. Drink.

122
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,830
You too.

123
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:33,138
Thank you.

124
00:11:33,338 --> 00:11:34,799
Oh. For the drink.

125
00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:38,409
I can afford to treat you this.

126
00:11:43,945 --> 00:11:44,945
Watch.

127
00:11:49,952 --> 00:11:51,000
Wow.

128
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:54,096
- You try.
- Mm.

129
00:12:14,911 --> 00:12:16,911
Wow, awesome!

130
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,827
So good!

131
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Right?

132
00:12:36,234 --> 00:12:38,927
Your mom's so mean.

133
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,855
Putting her work before her own child.

134
00:12:43,294 --> 00:12:44,333
Eh?

135
00:12:44,748 --> 00:12:47,027
Probably cuts corners on the job too.

136
00:12:47,346 --> 00:12:48,346
She doesn't!

137
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:52,277
Mom's busy, but she still cooks for me

138
00:12:52,302 --> 00:12:56,393
so I'm not lonely even though I don't
have a father. Mom's not mean at all!

139
00:13:02,217 --> 00:13:03,500
I see you understand.

140
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:07,770
Give me the bottle.

141
00:13:22,263 --> 00:13:24,875
It's so pretty.
It's like the sky's in there.

142
00:13:27,923 --> 00:13:29,833
I used to think that way.

143
00:13:33,902 --> 00:13:34,991
My mom...

144
00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:39,040
Will she be angry?

145
00:13:42,668 --> 00:13:44,836
If you care about her that much,

146
00:13:48,847 --> 00:13:50,076
don't do this again.

147
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,110
Come on. Let's get you home.

148
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:56,135
Eh?

149
00:13:56,326 --> 00:13:57,506
Let's go.

150
00:14:08,345 --> 00:14:09,345
Eh?

151
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What's the matter?

152
00:14:15,108 --> 00:14:17,802
I can't remember the way home.

153
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:20,802
Seriously?

154
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,706
What should I do?

155
00:14:26,082 --> 00:14:27,090
What's the address?

156
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:31,840
You probably don't know.

157
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:36,408
There's something green binding it.

158
00:14:37,182 --> 00:14:38,182
Binding it?

159
00:14:38,368 --> 00:14:42,058
And there's a path for walking.

160
00:14:44,138 --> 00:14:45,532
I can't think of anything.

161
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:47,887
Oh.

162
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:51,229
I might have an idea.

163
00:14:56,513 --> 00:14:57,917
Is it the place?

164
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,380
This is where I passed by.

165
00:15:03,024 --> 00:15:04,024
This too.

166
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,565
How did you know?

167
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:13,237
I had the same thought
when I almost got lost earlier.

168
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,709
So your brain works like a child's.

169
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,688
Don't tell me
you're secretly insulting me.

170
00:15:22,728 --> 00:15:24,264
That was a compliment.

171
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,501
Come on. Let's hurry
before you forget the way.

172
00:15:28,526 --> 00:15:29,526
Mm.

173
00:15:45,596 --> 00:15:46,875
Is it here?

174
00:15:46,907 --> 00:15:48,010
Mm.

175
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,115
Oh.

176
00:15:51,296 --> 00:15:52,549
Kairi!

177
00:15:53,591 --> 00:15:54,682
Kairi!

178
00:15:57,701 --> 00:15:58,900
That's my mom.

179
00:16:03,257 --> 00:16:04,445
You'll be okay.

180
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:14,277
Mom!

181
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:17,860
Kairi.

182
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:20,553
Where have you been?

183
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:22,251
You're not working?

184
00:16:23,968 --> 00:16:26,240
I was so worried about you
I couldn't work.

185
00:16:29,181 --> 00:16:31,116
Thank God you're safe.

186
00:16:31,594 --> 00:16:33,597
- I'm sorry.
- Mm.

187
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:39,029
Mom, those guys brought me home.

188
00:16:42,317 --> 00:16:44,115
Thank you very much.

189
00:16:44,872 --> 00:16:46,785
And I'm sorry for the trouble.

190
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:48,017
Not at all.

191
00:16:48,387 --> 00:16:50,212
It's no trouble.

192
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,623
I almost forget, Mom. Here.

193
00:16:56,077 --> 00:16:57,796
- For me?
- Mm.

194
00:16:58,649 --> 00:16:59,795
Thank you.

195
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:03,807
Glass is artificial.

196
00:17:09,335 --> 00:17:11,005
- It's beautiful.
- Mm.

197
00:17:22,201 --> 00:17:23,822
Bye-bye!

198
00:17:24,633 --> 00:17:26,104
Bye-bye!

199
00:17:27,502 --> 00:17:28,572
Let's go.

200
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:41,139
Let's get back.

201
00:17:41,577 --> 00:17:42,577
Yes.

202
00:17:47,298 --> 00:17:49,362
Are you serious?

203
00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:54,371
What should I do?

204
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:58,744
Come on.

205
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:01,189
Eh? I don't think that's a good idea.

206
00:18:01,232 --> 00:18:03,394
Don't overthink and waste time.

207
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:05,398
I have an extra pair of sneakers.

208
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,590
Come on.

209
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:09,795
Eh?

210
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,859
Your back is... really broad.

211
00:18:24,623 --> 00:18:27,137
Well, unlike you, I work out.

212
00:18:31,514 --> 00:18:33,793
It's dark already.

213
00:18:34,735 --> 00:18:38,122
Mm. The others must have
started playing sparklers.

214
00:18:40,372 --> 00:18:44,312
You really are a kind person.

215
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,625
Huh?

216
00:18:47,646 --> 00:18:52,126
That kid was happy about
both Ramune and the marble.

217
00:18:55,376 --> 00:18:56,924
That was my hope.

218
00:18:59,783 --> 00:19:01,291
Why do you...

219
00:19:02,636 --> 00:19:04,645
like marbles?

220
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:14,085
Because they're more beautiful
than the real thing.

221
00:19:16,174 --> 00:19:17,726
The real thing?

222
00:19:22,443 --> 00:19:24,306
All right. We're here.

223
00:19:25,175 --> 00:19:27,215
Oh, Tai-chan!

224
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,753
Takara took forever.

225
00:19:28,778 --> 00:19:30,521
Sorry I'm late.

226
00:19:31,115 --> 00:19:33,095
But what's wrong with Nakano-kun?

227
00:19:34,175 --> 00:19:35,815
One of his flip flops broke.

228
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,136
Get me my sneakers.

229
00:19:38,621 --> 00:19:41,229
Eh? Where's your bag?

230
00:19:51,459 --> 00:19:53,405
- So beautiful.
- Really beautiful.

231
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,724
- Amazing.
- Right?

232
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:57,250
Try twirling them.

233
00:20:00,803 --> 00:20:02,530
- Be careful. It's hot.
- Be careful.

234
00:20:03,659 --> 00:20:07,946
Every couple looks very in love.

235
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,308
People are pairing off
during school breaks.

236
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,800
Every couple looks so excited.

237
00:20:14,392 --> 00:20:16,774
But when people get to know each other,

238
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:19,297
they can develop
feelings for each other.

239
00:20:20,316 --> 00:20:23,135
Is that how it works?

240
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,160
Mm.

241
00:20:26,665 --> 00:20:29,514
By the way, Yui-san,
are you dating anyone?

242
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:32,133
Don't bother hitting on me.
I'm fine like this.

243
00:20:32,655 --> 00:20:34,655
So heartless.

244
00:20:43,394 --> 00:20:44,394
Senior.

245
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:47,455
Here.

246
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:58,733
They say people pair off
during summer breaks.

247
00:20:59,615 --> 00:21:01,240
That may be true.

248
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:07,324
So... don't you do that?

249
00:21:08,547 --> 00:21:09,547
Huh?

250
00:21:09,558 --> 00:21:13,096
I mean you're popular.

251
00:21:13,263 --> 00:21:17,085
So I'm wondering
why you're not dating anyone.

252
00:21:24,455 --> 00:21:26,482
(Kawai Momoka)

253
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,456
Eh?

254
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,682
You're not taking the call?

255
00:21:36,933 --> 00:21:37,933
Mm.

256
00:21:44,987 --> 00:21:46,016
Oh.

257
00:21:53,074 --> 00:21:54,314
It's over.

258
00:22:03,804 --> 00:22:07,897
Who was it that called him just now?

259
00:22:15,658 --> 00:22:19,840
What is this feeling?

260
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:16,690
(Next episode)
Is that his girlfriend?

261
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:20,145
I think he's got a crush on
an older girl outside of our university.

262
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,756
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

263
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:26,310
I want to know
everything about you, Senior.

264
00:23:29,165 --> 00:23:30,915
It's none of your business.

265
00:23:31,349 --> 00:23:33,640
He might die

266
00:23:34,378 --> 00:23:37,350
if no one takes care of him.
