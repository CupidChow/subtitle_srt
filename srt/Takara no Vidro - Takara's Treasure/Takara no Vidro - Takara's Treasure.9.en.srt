1
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,042
That guy showed up unexpectedly.

2
00:00:22,613 --> 00:00:24,450
That guy...

3
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:39,363
So you should go home.

4
00:00:41,045 --> 00:00:43,278
Your family...

5
00:00:43,302 --> 00:00:46,672
Did they let you come out here
and cry alone without caring?

6
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:50,321
They didn't.

7
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,817
Both my parents are kind.

8
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,530
I don't want cheap things like this.

9
00:01:05,262 --> 00:01:06,262
Is that so?

10
00:01:10,434 --> 00:01:12,037
So you'll be okay.

11
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:17,324
I'll walk you home
when you're done crying.

12
00:01:19,472 --> 00:01:20,592
Mister?

13
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:27,705
Where are you from?

14
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:33,241
Tokyo.

15
00:01:34,566 --> 00:01:39,139
I'm a student at Nakaba University.

16
00:01:43,183 --> 00:01:45,396
I couldn't take my eyes off him.

17
00:01:46,295 --> 00:01:48,092
Like the marble on that day.

18
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,526
I'm the only one reflecting
in those flickering eyes.

19
00:02:52,254 --> 00:02:57,560
"Takara's Treasure"
(Episode 9)

20
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,710
Silly face.

21
00:03:20,143 --> 00:03:21,538
Senior.

22
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,196
Is there something wrong?

23
00:03:24,608 --> 00:03:25,608
No.

24
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,990
I just thought you looked happy.

25
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:37,617
Wanna come to my place today?

26
00:03:38,275 --> 00:03:39,800
I can?

27
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:44,011
Your face is really silly.

28
00:03:46,735 --> 00:03:47,858
Senior,

29
00:03:48,672 --> 00:03:50,875
I picked up all the trash.

30
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:53,436
You didn't have to do that.

31
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,939
Some of it was mine.

32
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,190
All done.

33
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:11,421
So I guess I should go home.

34
00:04:13,006 --> 00:04:15,221
Go to campus from here tomorrow.

35
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,880
Eh?

36
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,323
No point in going home now.

37
00:04:22,735 --> 00:04:25,272
But I don't have any clothes.

38
00:04:26,851 --> 00:04:28,390
Just wear my stuff.

39
00:04:31,044 --> 00:04:32,513
I can?

40
00:04:43,544 --> 00:04:48,535
- You're embarrassed.
- You talk too much.

41
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,940
- I don't.
- Don't talk.

42
00:04:51,965 --> 00:04:53,329
You're embarrassed?

43
00:04:53,354 --> 00:04:56,594
- I'm not.
- So what are you?

44
00:04:57,503 --> 00:04:58,886
I'm not embarrassed.

45
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,700
Senior?

46
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:09,163
Senior Takara?

47
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:18,024
Uh, breakfast's ready.
Do you want to eat it now?

48
00:05:22,763 --> 00:05:25,328
Mm, thank you.

49
00:05:25,548 --> 00:05:26,548
Yes.

50
00:05:32,451 --> 00:05:35,027
At first it was just a fleeting thought.

51
00:05:37,273 --> 00:05:41,948
Eating together.
Going to campus from my place.

52
00:05:43,049 --> 00:05:45,118
Letting him wear my clothes.

53
00:05:50,929 --> 00:05:53,153
Letting him playing with my marbles.

54
00:05:55,631 --> 00:06:00,423
But he's always cheerful
like a crazy person.

55
00:06:15,155 --> 00:06:16,661
But I don't dare pick him up.

56
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:21,335
Because he's not a marble.

57
00:06:28,436 --> 00:06:31,052
Senior, your detergent's almost out.

58
00:06:31,077 --> 00:06:34,527
Well, let's buy it on our way back.

59
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:39,379
The shop at the intersection is cheaper
than the one in front of the station.

60
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:40,442
I'll buy it for you.

61
00:06:41,956 --> 00:06:43,414
Are you a housewife?

62
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:46,626
Gee, you're being ridiculous.

63
00:06:48,523 --> 00:06:52,045
Do Tai-chan and Senior Takara
seem awfully chummy these days?

64
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,794
Yes, they're always together.

65
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:56,019
And sometimes he
leaves with Senior Takara.

66
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:58,046
They're like this at the club too.

67
00:06:58,086 --> 00:06:59,423
Oh, Akira-kun.

68
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:03,878
I've never seen the stoic
Senior Takara making that face.

69
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:05,609
- Mm.
- So noble.

70
00:07:06,547 --> 00:07:09,905
It's really strange
he cares that much about a junior.

71
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:14,000
It's cool to see many sides of our idol,
but it feels inexplicably complicated.

72
00:07:15,049 --> 00:07:19,675
It's good to know someone cold as ice
like him can make such a gentle face.

73
00:07:23,451 --> 00:07:24,993
(Hiking Club)

74
00:07:38,851 --> 00:07:40,626
- Yo.
- Whoa!

75
00:07:41,248 --> 00:07:44,460
- You startled me.
- Takara, you've been distant lately.

76
00:07:44,485 --> 00:07:45,608
About what?

77
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:49,537
Well, these days
you seem close to Nakano.

78
00:07:50,193 --> 00:07:51,765
- Is that so?
- Mm.

79
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:56,743
I've been busy looking for work.
Pay me some attention?

80
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:03,704
But when you graduate,
Nakano will feel lonely.

81
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,240
Maybe not.

82
00:08:07,352 --> 00:08:09,715
Of course he will.
He's so attached to you.

83
00:08:14,609 --> 00:08:15,518
What's wrong?

84
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:17,486
It's nothing.

85
00:08:21,609 --> 00:08:24,002
Oh, wanna choose our next mountain?

86
00:08:25,262 --> 00:08:29,759
- Right.
- Where are we going? Let me see.

87
00:08:30,064 --> 00:08:32,286
Mm, this one's doable.

88
00:08:32,337 --> 00:08:35,477
- Oh, this one?
- Right? Where else?

89
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:44,534
Senior?

90
00:08:45,729 --> 00:08:47,563
What is this?

91
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:52,313
Oh, the photos my grandfather took.

92
00:08:53,682 --> 00:08:55,755
So awesome.

93
00:08:56,574 --> 00:08:58,588
Mountains in other countries?

94
00:08:59,847 --> 00:09:02,597
He's a world traveler.

95
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:09,716
I wanna try that someday.

96
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,692
Wanna go hiking together?

97
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:20,309
Eh?

98
00:09:22,006 --> 00:09:24,976
On a mountain around here.

99
00:09:25,969 --> 00:09:27,411
I'd love to!

100
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:28,916
Lower your voice.

101
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:32,020
I'm sorry.

102
00:09:34,118 --> 00:09:35,158
Uh...

103
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:40,965
When you said "together,"
you mean just the two of us?

104
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:42,816
Of course.

105
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:47,271
Yes, I'll look forward to it.

106
00:09:52,905 --> 00:09:54,505
When the time comes,

107
00:09:56,783 --> 00:09:59,021
there's something I want you to decide.

108
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,818
Understood.

109
00:10:04,527 --> 00:10:09,836
You answered so quickly.
Now I wanna say it here.

110
00:10:11,631 --> 00:10:14,012
You're right.

111
00:10:16,021 --> 00:10:17,177
But I...

112
00:10:19,461 --> 00:10:22,370
think you'd rather say it
on the mountain.

113
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:52,418
This is the mountain from my first hike.

114
00:10:57,311 --> 00:10:59,664
I'm getting nostalgic.

115
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:07,181
I don't get why they always choose places
unsuitable for beginners every year.

116
00:11:08,063 --> 00:11:13,224
It's to shed people who came for you.

117
00:11:15,017 --> 00:11:16,017
Hm?

118
00:11:17,874 --> 00:11:19,138
Nothing.

119
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,902
You look a lot more competent.

120
00:11:25,674 --> 00:11:27,588
Is that so?

121
00:11:29,275 --> 00:11:30,455
Let's go.

122
00:11:47,564 --> 00:11:48,810
Refreshing, right?

123
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:50,045
Yes.

124
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:59,017
Hm, you're still doing okay.

125
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:01,749
Yes, I'm still doing okay.

126
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:05,015
Back then you were gasping.

127
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:09,208
Well, I've hiked up
many mountains this year.

128
00:12:18,492 --> 00:12:19,492
Wow.

129
00:12:21,978 --> 00:12:25,931
There are Sargent's cherry here.

130
00:12:26,891 --> 00:12:29,495
During your first hike,
you noticed these things.

131
00:12:30,348 --> 00:12:31,348
Eh?

132
00:12:34,332 --> 00:12:36,690
You were watching me?

133
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:39,259
Mm.

134
00:12:39,631 --> 00:12:43,436
Ugh, I was so embarrassing.

135
00:12:53,532 --> 00:12:54,632
Se...

136
00:12:54,657 --> 00:12:56,197
Senior?

137
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:58,783
You don't like it?

138
00:12:59,692 --> 00:13:00,745
No.

139
00:13:02,186 --> 00:13:03,923
It's not like that.

140
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:06,893
Let's go.

141
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,710
Yes.

142
00:13:19,219 --> 00:13:20,485
- One, two.
- One, two.

143
00:13:22,774 --> 00:13:24,454
- Okay.
- Hold that side.

144
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:25,479
Yes.

145
00:13:26,516 --> 00:13:27,792
Attach it to the hook.

146
00:13:27,817 --> 00:13:29,368
Oh, understood.

147
00:13:38,003 --> 00:13:39,540
It'll be ready soon.

148
00:13:40,349 --> 00:13:41,959
I'll make some coffee.

149
00:13:42,403 --> 00:13:43,507
Thank you.

150
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:52,576
Wow, it looks delicious.

151
00:13:59,043 --> 00:14:00,548
This is fun.

152
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,960
Mm.

153
00:14:07,148 --> 00:14:09,861
It's so beautiful.

154
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:13,118
Mm.

155
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,936
I'd love to come here again.

156
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:28,989
Senior?

157
00:14:34,154 --> 00:14:36,887
I don't know if there'll be a next time.

158
00:14:38,975 --> 00:14:39,975
Eh?

159
00:14:41,635 --> 00:14:43,357
After I graduate,

160
00:14:44,486 --> 00:14:47,499
I'm gonna hike up mountains
around the world with my grandfather.

161
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:53,868
You won't you come here again
because you'll go abroad next year?

162
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,866
Can't I be with you until then?

163
00:15:08,602 --> 00:15:09,745
No.

164
00:15:13,405 --> 00:15:15,015
That's not what I meant.

165
00:15:17,624 --> 00:15:19,961
It makes me wanna take you with me.

166
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:23,959
Eh?

167
00:15:29,016 --> 00:15:30,478
Even though I...

168
00:15:32,267 --> 00:15:34,665
had already chosen
my path for the future,

169
00:15:37,108 --> 00:15:40,291
I was still being irresponsible
and got involved with you.

170
00:15:43,497 --> 00:15:44,850
So,

171
00:15:46,276 --> 00:15:48,761
should we stop this relationship here

172
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,956
or should we keep going?

173
00:15:59,238 --> 00:16:00,801
You decide.

174
00:16:04,848 --> 00:16:05,848
Eh?

175
00:16:11,864 --> 00:16:15,155
I've been collecting marbles
since I was a kid.

176
00:16:18,004 --> 00:16:20,690
If I want something, I must have it.

177
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,691
I'm just like my mother.

178
00:16:27,869 --> 00:16:30,323
People who want to
monopolize what they want

179
00:16:31,745 --> 00:16:33,919
and care only about themselves.

180
00:16:36,468 --> 00:16:37,527
So...

181
00:16:41,111 --> 00:16:43,476
I might break your heart.

182
00:16:48,318 --> 00:16:49,440
So I...

183
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,344
I say we keep going.

184
00:17:00,888 --> 00:17:05,610
I always thought you often talked
about things that were hard to understand.

185
00:17:07,814 --> 00:17:09,164
But don't tell me...

186
00:17:11,474 --> 00:17:15,668
that you're afraid of falling in love.

187
00:17:20,811 --> 00:17:24,591
You're nothing like your mother.

188
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:32,778
You really saved me when we first met.

189
00:17:34,765 --> 00:17:37,452
Meeting you back then...

190
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:41,590
has brought me here now.

191
00:17:43,705 --> 00:17:48,044
Senior Takara,
you've been taking care of me.

192
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:52,040
You're a kind person, Senior.

193
00:18:00,387 --> 00:18:01,610
That's...

194
00:18:03,224 --> 00:18:05,572
The marble you gave me.

195
00:18:15,092 --> 00:18:20,937
You gave me
the most beautiful thing, didn't you?

196
00:18:22,711 --> 00:18:24,582
So...

197
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:29,920
it's the most beautiful thing
for me too.

198
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:44,875
I...

199
00:18:46,847 --> 00:18:49,830
want to be with you forever.

200
00:19:03,835 --> 00:19:08,901
I don't want to stop this relationship.

201
00:19:14,261 --> 00:19:21,244
Because you gave me the courage
to move forward.

202
00:19:33,295 --> 00:19:34,578
Is that so?

203
00:19:38,132 --> 00:19:39,575
You're right.

204
00:20:08,366 --> 00:20:09,695
Thank you.

205
00:20:46,237 --> 00:20:47,457
But...

206
00:20:49,468 --> 00:20:51,688
if you don't want to stop,

207
00:20:55,349 --> 00:20:58,777
don't look at me as just a kind senior.

208
00:21:02,392 --> 00:21:03,778
But...

209
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:07,157
you're a good person.

210
00:21:14,475 --> 00:21:15,680
The point is...

211
00:21:18,015 --> 00:21:23,015
even I don't know what will happen next.

212
00:21:28,013 --> 00:21:30,073
If you agree to continue,

213
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,876
I don't care about anything else.

214
00:21:42,423 --> 00:21:43,423
But...

215
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:48,344
if I don't like something you do,
I'll let you know.

216
00:21:56,727 --> 00:21:59,216
Armpit. Don't touch my armpit.

217
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:04,261
It looks like this guy
I inadvertently picked up...

218
00:22:06,234 --> 00:22:11,125
will stay in my hand and still only
have eyes for me as he always does.

219
00:22:19,118 --> 00:22:21,665
(Chizuru: Bro, Mom's in trouble!
Come home immediately!)

220
00:23:12,066 --> 00:23:13,860
(Next episode)
Stay safe.

221
00:23:13,885 --> 00:23:14,602
Yes.

222
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:17,100
Taishin changed after meeting you.

223
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:19,513
It's cool to meet up
with someone we like.

224
00:23:19,538 --> 00:23:23,975
I've finally become someone you like?

225
00:23:28,172 --> 00:23:32,881
I didn't think being with someone
would feel like this.

226
00:23:32,984 --> 00:23:35,827
Because I want to
continue being with you.
