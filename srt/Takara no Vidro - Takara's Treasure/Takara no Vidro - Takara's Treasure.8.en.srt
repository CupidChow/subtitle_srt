1
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:03,816
Mm.

2
00:00:04,456 --> 00:00:07,880
And what do these rocks
and this oil look like?

3
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:11,506
It's called a stone diffuser.

4
00:00:11,858 --> 00:00:15,353
Pretty stones diffuse an aroma
when you drop an essential oil on them.

5
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:20,380
Oh, I found wooden sticks in a bottle.

6
00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:23,559
I told you they were stones,
not wooden sticks.

7
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,760
The items the model Mimi-chan posted
aren't available here yet.

8
00:00:27,785 --> 00:00:28,785
Mm.

9
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:31,011
I'll find them and send them to you.

10
00:00:31,382 --> 00:00:33,971
Mm, thank you. I'm counting on you.

11
00:00:33,996 --> 00:00:34,996
Mm.

12
00:00:37,427 --> 00:00:39,674
Well? What did you find out?

13
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:46,211
It's a set of rocks and oil.
It's called an aroma diffuser.

14
00:00:46,236 --> 00:00:48,758
- Mm.
- And it's only sold in Tokyo,

15
00:00:50,345 --> 00:00:52,654
Oh, aroma stones.

16
00:00:53,351 --> 00:00:55,671
If that's what you want, wait a sec.

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,320
Ah.

18
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:01,691
Mm, she probably means this.

19
00:01:01,824 --> 00:01:04,239
- Oh, thank you.
- Mm.

20
00:01:15,852 --> 00:01:20,264
If I remember correctly,
Senior has them in his room as well.

21
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:30,202
Okay, I'll date you.

22
00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:38,417
Am I really dating Senior now?

23
00:01:51,126 --> 00:01:58,204
Or maybe he and I
don't suit each other at all.

24
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:07,460
So expensive.

25
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:55,169
"Takara's Treasure"
(Episode 8)

26
00:02:58,057 --> 00:03:00,957
Yesterday I went to Mr. Masaya's shop.

27
00:03:01,105 --> 00:03:03,636
Yeah? You went shopping?

28
00:03:03,661 --> 00:03:09,385
Yes, I bought a diff... diff... diffu...

29
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,410
Hm?

30
00:03:10,435 --> 00:03:14,765
They're fragrant stones
that are also in your room.

31
00:03:16,657 --> 00:03:18,357
Oh, a diffuser?

32
00:03:18,382 --> 00:03:22,068
Ah, that's right.
I'm interested in it too.

33
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,034
This scent is only sold in Tokyo.

34
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:27,742
Is that so?

35
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:29,695
Eh?

36
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,324
Someone gave it to me.

37
00:03:32,327 --> 00:03:33,844
Is that so?

38
00:03:34,303 --> 00:03:38,843
Maybe from a club member as my birthday
present last year. So I left it out.

39
00:03:41,403 --> 00:03:43,103
I see.

40
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:53,823
Uh...

41
00:03:56,911 --> 00:03:58,024
What's up?

42
00:03:59,985 --> 00:04:01,407
Why the face?

43
00:04:04,346 --> 00:04:05,694
Or...

44
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,305
maybe I really don't suit you.

45
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,460
Huh?

46
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:18,211
Bubbly people who seem fitting
with stylish, beautiful, cute things

47
00:04:18,236 --> 00:04:24,699
like a diffuser or things of that sort
might suit you better.

48
00:04:25,462 --> 00:04:31,050
But if we break off this relationship,
you will feel uncomfortable

49
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,379
and I won't be able to be with you.

50
00:04:35,206 --> 00:04:39,679
Plus, you're not really into me.

51
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:43,125
So I don't know what to do.

52
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:50,140
Does dating mean you must be 100%
into each other from the beginning?

53
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,150
Eh?

54
00:04:55,326 --> 00:04:58,544
We can go slow
until we're 100% into each other.

55
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,800
But I can't help thinking
we don't suit each other at all.

56
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:07,516
I don't care if we suit each other.

57
00:05:10,131 --> 00:05:16,940
So I can try until you're 100% into me?

58
00:05:20,373 --> 00:05:23,641
But there are some things that
doing them would be in vain.

59
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:25,701
Eh?

60
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,339
Who knows about the future.

61
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:32,093
You're right.

62
00:05:32,117 --> 00:05:34,789
It's probably only ten now.

63
00:05:34,814 --> 00:05:36,899
No, probably lower than that.

64
00:05:37,454 --> 00:05:39,892
- Probably five.
- I give up.

65
00:05:43,965 --> 00:05:46,825
Wanna go somewhere next week?

66
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,680
Eh?

67
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,120
Let's hang out this coming holiday.

68
00:05:54,207 --> 00:05:55,207
Yes.

69
00:05:55,798 --> 00:05:59,051
I'll think about where we should go.

70
00:05:59,929 --> 00:06:01,909
We can go where you wanna go.

71
00:06:02,706 --> 00:06:04,206
Understood.

72
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,810
Is this...

73
00:06:12,578 --> 00:06:13,666
a date?

74
00:06:18,514 --> 00:06:20,811
Oh, where should I go?

75
00:06:21,372 --> 00:06:23,078
Hm? You already have a plan?

76
00:06:23,103 --> 00:06:26,223
- Next week is Akira-kun's birthday.
- A date?

77
00:06:26,248 --> 00:06:28,709
- I'm so jealous.
- A date...

78
00:06:29,096 --> 00:06:31,913
Hey, where are you two going on a date?

79
00:06:32,365 --> 00:06:36,391
Mm, so far we've only
been to Ruirui's events,

80
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:39,038
so I don't know
where we should go this time.

81
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,384
- I like amusement parks.
- So childish.

82
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:46,111
I take my dates to
a haunted house to make them scream.

83
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:49,481
What if it's your birthday, Tai-chan?
Where do you wanna go?

84
00:06:49,506 --> 00:06:50,875
I wanna know too.

85
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,926
Eh?

86
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,180
I'd be glad just having someone
who wants to take me somewhere.

87
00:06:56,357 --> 00:06:58,875
Tai-chan really is noble.

88
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,342
In the end,
it's the feeling that matters most.

89
00:07:01,869 --> 00:07:02,883
Is that so?

90
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:05,867
Of course. It's about attentiveness.

91
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,262
- Takara?
- Huh?

92
00:07:10,356 --> 00:07:12,037
It's my birthday next week.

93
00:07:12,905 --> 00:07:14,694
Happy birthday.

94
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:16,264
Show some enthusiasm.

95
00:07:17,022 --> 00:07:19,821
- Celebrating with your girlfriend?
- Yeah.

96
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:24,366
But a student life passes quickly.

97
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:26,209
I agree.

98
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:31,786
We've been together since high school,
but soon we must go our separate ways.

99
00:07:33,136 --> 00:07:34,369
Feeling lonely?

100
00:07:34,394 --> 00:07:35,834
Of course I am.

101
00:07:36,953 --> 00:07:38,452
Let's get together sometime.

102
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,316
That's a given.

103
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:43,617
But once we start working,

104
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,766
we won't have this freedom.

105
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,993
Mm.

106
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:52,342
- What will you do?
- Hm?

107
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,578
Gonna live with your grandpa?

108
00:07:58,592 --> 00:07:59,789
About that,

109
00:08:00,726 --> 00:08:02,182
I don't know yet.

110
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,500
(Tokyo Guide)

111
00:08:06,524 --> 00:08:09,810
Where should we go?

112
00:08:14,897 --> 00:08:15,897
Hm?

113
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:21,601
(Red-flanked Bluetails, "Blue Birds
That Bring Joy," Still a Sight in Kanto)

114
00:08:25,334 --> 00:08:27,170
This is it.

115
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:33,845
What is this?

116
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,170
Today we're gonna birdwatch.

117
00:08:37,189 --> 00:08:38,189
Yeah?

118
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,136
Here's the guide.

119
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:50,662
We'll start by finding a rare bird
called the "red-flanked bluetail."

120
00:08:50,673 --> 00:08:51,960
(Birdwatching Guide)
Right.

121
00:08:51,971 --> 00:08:55,316
Plus lots of flowers are blooming.
Let's walk around and birdwatch.

122
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,979
There's also this delicious
spiced curry. We'll have lunch there.

123
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:05,306
- You don't like spicy food.
- I'm okay if it's from spices.

124
00:09:06,115 --> 00:09:07,248
I'm so confused.

125
00:09:07,272 --> 00:09:12,253
Then we'll stop at a great coffee shop
nearby. I have it all planned out.

126
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:14,763
Sure.

127
00:09:14,894 --> 00:09:16,121
Then let's go.

128
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:18,147
Okay.

129
00:09:30,652 --> 00:09:32,129
Have you found one?

130
00:09:33,264 --> 00:09:35,751
Hm, I haven't.

131
00:09:39,891 --> 00:09:40,956
Oh!

132
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,132
Huh?

133
00:09:43,024 --> 00:09:45,385
That's a great cormorant.

134
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,365
Oh, do you know great cormorants?

135
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,629
Mm.

136
00:09:50,782 --> 00:09:53,476
Great cormorants are cool.

137
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:56,869
They're birds,
but they can dive to catch fish.

138
00:09:57,807 --> 00:10:00,181
So cool that they can both swim and fly.

139
00:10:01,925 --> 00:10:03,378
Yeah, you're right.

140
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,554
It's almost noon.
Senior, are you hungry yet?

141
00:10:14,193 --> 00:10:15,293
A little.

142
00:10:15,388 --> 00:10:19,930
So let's pause the birdwatching
and go eat some curry.

143
00:10:24,003 --> 00:10:25,367
Let's eat.

144
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:28,207
Let's eat.

145
00:10:36,695 --> 00:10:37,719
Mm.

146
00:10:38,376 --> 00:10:39,684
It's so good.

147
00:10:42,088 --> 00:10:43,088
It's good.

148
00:10:43,448 --> 00:10:45,693
I've never eaten curry like this before.

149
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:50,781
Because I only know the curry
we cook when we go camping.

150
00:10:51,512 --> 00:10:53,176
That kind's good too.

151
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:59,638
I remember the first time
I hiked with everyone from the club.

152
00:11:02,491 --> 00:11:03,491
Mm.

153
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:07,210
I wanna do that with everyone again.

154
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,380
I know.

155
00:11:14,571 --> 00:11:16,421
Even though they always make a fuss.

156
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:19,312
But lately,

157
00:11:19,908 --> 00:11:22,914
more people couldn't join
because they had to apply for jobs.

158
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,728
Will you find work too?

159
00:11:30,662 --> 00:11:32,086
Haven't decided yet.

160
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:34,009
Yeah.

161
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:40,099
What about you?

162
00:11:41,626 --> 00:11:45,392
I haven't thought of anything yet.

163
00:11:47,516 --> 00:11:49,138
Well, you're still a freshman.

164
00:11:49,164 --> 00:11:50,164
Right.

165
00:11:51,556 --> 00:11:52,563
Plus,

166
00:11:53,844 --> 00:11:58,484
I chose this university
because I wanted to see you.

167
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,956
But it's been really fun.

168
00:12:03,995 --> 00:12:07,695
I got to both make friends
and learn how to hike.

169
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,723
It's all because of you.

170
00:12:11,614 --> 00:12:13,249
Thank you very much.

171
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,799
- Listen...
- Oh, Senior.

172
00:12:24,824 --> 00:12:26,825
I actually have something good.

173
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,850
Huh?

174
00:12:28,212 --> 00:12:30,316
If you want it spicier, add this.

175
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:32,888
Chili sauce?

176
00:12:34,232 --> 00:12:36,252
You didn't need to bring it.

177
00:12:36,277 --> 00:12:38,350
Well, my goal is to reach 100%.

178
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,226
Want me to do yours too?

179
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,714
No, it's okay. I'm good.

180
00:12:53,756 --> 00:12:56,934
They're so hard to find.

181
00:12:57,182 --> 00:12:58,182
I know.

182
00:12:58,475 --> 00:13:01,309
Uh, Senior, are you thirsty?

183
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:02,779
A little bit.

184
00:13:02,804 --> 00:13:04,635
Then I'll go buy us drinks.

185
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,660
Mm.

186
00:13:09,301 --> 00:13:10,301
Eh?

187
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:13,930
Eh?

188
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:15,690
What's wrong?

189
00:13:17,176 --> 00:13:19,302
Uh, I...

190
00:13:21,274 --> 00:13:23,914
I lost my wallet.

191
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,090
Huh?

192
00:13:27,156 --> 00:13:29,076
I remember I just used it.

193
00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:32,609
It should be in this park.

194
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,017
Is it at the table we were just at?

195
00:13:40,572 --> 00:13:42,447
Let's look there first.

196
00:13:43,815 --> 00:13:44,815
Yes.

197
00:13:48,115 --> 00:13:50,442
It's about this size.

198
00:13:51,028 --> 00:13:53,229
There's a key chain on it too.

199
00:13:56,805 --> 00:13:58,057
It's black, right?

200
00:13:59,963 --> 00:14:01,463
How big is it again?

201
00:14:03,071 --> 00:14:05,085
A small square shape.

202
00:14:06,183 --> 00:14:07,881
My house key's on it too.

203
00:14:11,372 --> 00:14:12,476
It's not here.

204
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:17,298
But if you dropped it,
we should've heard it.

205
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:22,089
I'm really sorry.

206
00:14:25,376 --> 00:14:27,641
No need to apologize. Let's find it.

207
00:14:29,372 --> 00:14:30,372
Yes.

208
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,480
Yes.

209
00:14:53,098 --> 00:14:54,098
Yes.

210
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:56,823
I see.

211
00:14:57,551 --> 00:14:58,758
Is that so?

212
00:15:00,392 --> 00:15:01,392
Understood.

213
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,090
No one has taken it to the police yet.

214
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,866
Should we try looking over there?

215
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:21,379
Uh...

216
00:15:22,348 --> 00:15:24,093
I can do it alone.

217
00:15:26,547 --> 00:15:27,560
Why?

218
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:33,370
I can't trouble you further.

219
00:15:35,994 --> 00:15:39,974
It was me who got distracted.

220
00:15:41,531 --> 00:15:42,847
All day today.

221
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,557
I'm really sorry.

222
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:53,703
I got so distracted I lost my wallet.

223
00:15:54,613 --> 00:15:56,582
What the heck am I doing?

224
00:16:01,007 --> 00:16:02,172
Listen to me.

225
00:16:03,105 --> 00:16:04,839
- You and I...
- Uh...

226
00:16:06,816 --> 00:16:09,203
Sorry to interrupt.

227
00:16:09,637 --> 00:16:13,078
I heard you guys talking about a wallet.

228
00:16:13,701 --> 00:16:14,701
Eh?

229
00:16:15,268 --> 00:16:20,054
I mean, did you lose your wallet?

230
00:16:22,913 --> 00:16:24,124
I did.

231
00:16:24,348 --> 00:16:25,379
Oh.

232
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,144
Is it this one?

233
00:16:36,593 --> 00:16:39,362
Yes, it is.

234
00:16:39,604 --> 00:16:41,373
That's a relief.

235
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,412
I just found it over there.

236
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:47,744
I was gonna take it to the police box.

237
00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:50,493
I'm glad you found it.

238
00:16:51,502 --> 00:16:53,045
Thank you very much.

239
00:16:53,293 --> 00:16:55,492
Uh, I should repay you...

240
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:58,423
It's okay. You don't have to.

241
00:16:58,448 --> 00:17:01,876
Luckily I found it before dark.

242
00:17:02,892 --> 00:17:04,797
You guys get home safe.

243
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,316
Yes.

244
00:17:22,555 --> 00:17:23,555
Here.

245
00:17:26,196 --> 00:17:27,196
Oh.

246
00:17:28,002 --> 00:17:29,518
Thank you.

247
00:17:41,723 --> 00:17:42,749
Senior.

248
00:17:44,682 --> 00:17:46,095
Why?

249
00:17:47,058 --> 00:17:48,058
Why what?

250
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:56,023
Why aren't you angry
and still kind to me?

251
00:18:00,961 --> 00:18:02,023
I can't...

252
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,820
even make you happy.

253
00:18:14,207 --> 00:18:15,601
What kind of bird are they?

254
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:19,682
Eh?

255
00:18:21,469 --> 00:18:24,918
Those bluetail something
you wanted to show me today.

256
00:18:24,943 --> 00:18:26,336
What are they like?

257
00:18:28,988 --> 00:18:30,254
Uh...

258
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,076
They're small birds, about 14 cm long.

259
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:39,360
They say if you see them,
you'll be happy.

260
00:18:40,637 --> 00:18:44,503
The name "bluetail"
comes from their blue tail.

261
00:18:45,076 --> 00:18:47,221
They're very beautiful.

262
00:18:48,826 --> 00:18:51,521
Small blue birds.

263
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:56,036
That's why...

264
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,891
I wanted to see one with you.

265
00:19:07,058 --> 00:19:11,805
I'm not here today to do
serious birdwatching with you.

266
00:19:16,476 --> 00:19:18,403
What do you mean?

267
00:19:20,842 --> 00:19:24,798
I came to discover
what you enjoyed doing.

268
00:19:26,778 --> 00:19:28,724
I just came for that.

269
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:35,645
Despite unexpected things, if today
ends well, it would've been fun.

270
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,304
Senior...

271
00:19:50,478 --> 00:19:52,569
this attitude of yours...

272
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:57,028
I love it.

273
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:08,656
Anyway,

274
00:20:13,236 --> 00:20:17,480
the fact that you got your wallet back
shows that they exist.

275
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,220
These birds.

276
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,847
You're right.

277
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,720
Oh.

278
00:20:30,825 --> 00:20:31,825
Eh?

279
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,840
Kidding.

280
00:20:33,026 --> 00:20:35,729
Jeez, don't do that to me.

281
00:20:38,189 --> 00:20:43,767
Look, Okame-kun.
This senior seems really interesting.

282
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:56,388
I hope we'll get to make
many more memories together.

283
00:21:10,305 --> 00:21:11,873
- Listen...
- Oh, senior.

284
00:21:11,898 --> 00:21:13,783
I actually have something good.

285
00:21:16,426 --> 00:21:18,620
Anyway, back there,

286
00:21:19,585 --> 00:21:22,494
it seemed like
he wanted to say something.

287
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,969
(October 12, Mizumoto Park)

288
00:21:45,994 --> 00:21:47,994
(Album successfully created)

289
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:50,891
(Taishin: Thank you for today.)

290
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,403
(Are you well?
It's starting to get cold here.)

291
00:22:12,428 --> 00:22:14,587
(When will you come after graduation?)

292
00:22:14,598 --> 00:22:15,598
(Hoei)

293
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:20,056
I have to explain this to him.

294
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:16,960
(Next episode) I couldn't take my eyes
off you. Like the marble on that day.

295
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,660
There's something I want you to decide.

296
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:20,933
Understood.

297
00:23:22,064 --> 00:23:27,299
Because you gave me
the courage to move forward.

298
00:23:28,627 --> 00:23:31,327
If I want something, I must have it.

299
00:23:32,054 --> 00:23:33,670
I'm just like my mother.

300
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:37,126
You're a kind person, Senior.
