00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,762
(Kawai Momoka)

2
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:31,471
Tai-chan, good morning!

3
00:00:32,188 --> 00:00:33,343
Good morning.

4
00:00:33,368 --> 00:00:35,885
The summer break was so short.

5
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,043
We got two months off.

6
00:00:38,211 --> 00:00:40,595
Summer breaks are fun.

7
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,305
- Right? You get to travel.
- Mm.

8
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,095
Here. Pictures from
when we were playing sparklers.

9
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,116
Oh, thank you.

10
00:00:47,141 --> 00:00:49,090
- Check them out.
- Really?

11
00:00:52,435 --> 00:00:55,794
Wow, a rare picture of Senior Takara.

12
00:00:56,467 --> 00:00:57,467
Mm.

13
00:00:58,354 --> 00:01:03,890
It was the summer break where
I got a little closer to Senior Takara.

14
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,136
(Hiking Club)

15
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:14,690
You guys are probably still distracted
now that the new semester began.

16
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:17,377
Tomorrow we will hike up Mount Takao!

17
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:18,916
- Yay!
- Yay!

18
00:01:19,226 --> 00:01:20,805
Hiking...

19
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,447
But this time
it's gonna be a relaxing hike.

20
00:01:23,471 --> 00:01:26,253
Freshmen can come.
Think of it as a field trip.

21
00:01:26,264 --> 00:01:27,721
What's the budget for snacks?

22
00:01:27,802 --> 00:01:30,357
Just 500 yen. Not one yen more.

23
00:01:30,461 --> 00:01:31,963
Why are you so strict?

24
00:01:31,974 --> 00:01:33,470
Do bananas qualify as snacks?

25
00:01:33,495 --> 00:01:36,115
They do because
they have nutritional value.

26
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,930
Can you come up with a new joke?

27
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:41,532
- Sorry. I have to take this call.
- Mm.

28
00:01:44,834 --> 00:01:48,260
So let's get into planning groups.

29
00:01:48,285 --> 00:01:51,007
How is he so cool
just going out to take the call?

30
00:01:51,032 --> 00:01:52,925
He's been getting lots of calls.

31
00:01:53,763 --> 00:01:56,394
Mm, especially lately.

32
00:01:56,419 --> 00:01:57,810
Who's been calling him?

33
00:01:57,835 --> 00:01:59,255
I wouldn't know.

34
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,981
I know who because I overheard them.

35
00:02:03,006 --> 00:02:04,758
Were you eavesdropping?

36
00:02:04,835 --> 00:02:08,895
I just happened to hear a woman's voice.

37
00:02:09,175 --> 00:02:10,409
- A woman?
- Mm.

38
00:02:10,434 --> 00:02:13,636
I think Takara finally
got himself a girlfriend.

39
00:02:13,674 --> 00:02:15,375
Is that so?

40
00:02:16,128 --> 00:02:16,870
Mm.

41
00:02:17,357 --> 00:02:19,346
Is this the person who...

42
00:02:21,587 --> 00:02:23,686
(Kawai Momoka)
called him back then?

43
00:02:24,029 --> 00:02:26,550
Hey, don't speculate.

44
00:02:26,575 --> 00:02:30,390
Yes, because as far as I know,
he doesn't have a girlfriend.

45
00:02:30,415 --> 00:02:31,415
No way he does.

46
00:02:31,426 --> 00:02:34,616
That's what you hope. Think about it.

47
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:37,287
How could someone
so handsome not have a girlfriend?

48
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:42,524
If I had to guess, he's probably madly
in love with an older girl off-campus.

49
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,694
No, no way!

50
00:02:45,212 --> 00:02:49,549
Don't tell me his possessive older
girlfriend has been checking in on him.

51
00:02:49,574 --> 00:02:52,892
That's not him being madly in love.

52
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,456
You're overthinking this.

53
00:02:55,785 --> 00:02:57,754
Senior...

54
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,479
has a girlfriend...

55
00:03:42,484 --> 00:03:47,809
"Takara's Treasure"
(Episode 6)

56
00:03:51,473 --> 00:03:53,211
Back there, was he...

57
00:03:53,907 --> 00:03:58,980
missing his girlfriend?

58
00:04:03,114 --> 00:04:06,453
It feels strange in my chest again.

59
00:04:17,255 --> 00:04:18,702
Is the meeting over?

60
00:04:18,727 --> 00:04:20,690
Uh, yes.

61
00:04:21,336 --> 00:04:24,291
We'll meet at the foot
of the mountain tomorrow at nine.

62
00:04:25,763 --> 00:04:26,804
Noted.

63
00:04:31,798 --> 00:04:32,798
What's up?

64
00:04:34,396 --> 00:04:36,114
No, it's just...

65
00:04:37,256 --> 00:04:38,256
It's just...

66
00:04:40,085 --> 00:04:43,083
Bananas are delicious
when we eat them on a mountain.

67
00:04:44,248 --> 00:04:45,585
What's up with you?

68
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:51,031
- By the way,
- Hmm.

69
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:55,068
you've been getting
a lot of calls lately.

70
00:04:55,804 --> 00:04:57,894
Who's been calling you?

71
00:05:01,627 --> 00:05:03,757
It's none of your business.

72
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,857
This is bad.

73
00:05:16,925 --> 00:05:19,182
I can't fall asleep.

74
00:05:41,154 --> 00:05:45,259
I actually managed to get close to him.

75
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:53,250
Did I offend him?

76
00:06:03,937 --> 00:06:04,937
Yes?

77
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,342
What's wrong? You sound angry.

78
00:06:08,305 --> 00:06:09,615
Oh, it's you, Grandpa.

79
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,448
Yes, it's your grandpa.

80
00:06:12,465 --> 00:06:14,306
Did you answer without checking?

81
00:06:16,117 --> 00:06:17,344
Kind of.

82
00:06:18,747 --> 00:06:20,187
What's wrong?

83
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:21,980
Are you okay?

84
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,630
Eh?

85
00:06:24,641 --> 00:06:26,682
You sound so down.

86
00:06:29,227 --> 00:06:30,661
I'm not feeling down.

87
00:06:31,117 --> 00:06:33,215
Got into a fight with your friend?

88
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,999
I said no.

89
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,241
Say what you feel, Takara.

90
00:06:45,829 --> 00:06:46,940
This is bad.

91
00:06:48,183 --> 00:06:50,538
I didn't sleep a wink.

92
00:06:59,531 --> 00:07:06,104
I really have to clear things up
with Senior Takara today.

93
00:07:12,047 --> 00:07:13,047
Huh?

94
00:07:17,255 --> 00:07:18,255
Eh?

95
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:23,432
(Takara: I have a cold.
I'll pass today.)

96
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,545
Did he get a fever?

97
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:28,121
(Akira: Really?)

98
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:33,578
(Minami: Can you manage by yourself?)
Will I bother him if I contact him?

99
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:38,491
But...

100
00:07:40,636 --> 00:07:42,990
if his fever gets high
that he can't move...

101
00:07:43,014 --> 00:07:44,740
Anybody...

102
00:07:45,474 --> 00:07:48,665
If no one's taking care of him...

103
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,814
he might die.

104
00:07:58,685 --> 00:08:00,805
Hello, what's up, Nakano-kun?

105
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,084
- I'll check on Senior Takara.
- Eh?

106
00:08:04,872 --> 00:08:05,872
Hello?

107
00:08:06,161 --> 00:08:07,816
Hello, Nakano-kun?

108
00:08:07,841 --> 00:08:09,297
What happened?

109
00:08:22,632 --> 00:08:24,810
Showing up unannounced.

110
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,058
Will it be okay?

111
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,009
(Taishin: I'm coming to you.)

112
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:31,426
But...

113
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,966
No.

114
00:08:34,343 --> 00:08:37,671
If I get there too late,
that would be worse.

115
00:08:47,237 --> 00:08:48,669
What do you want?

116
00:08:49,135 --> 00:08:50,452
Hey, Takara...

117
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,831
Is that his girlfriend?

118
00:08:55,856 --> 00:08:57,692
Why are you being so cold?

119
00:08:58,308 --> 00:09:00,508
Because you showed up at my place.

120
00:09:00,762 --> 00:09:02,083
I had no choice.

121
00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:06,693
Because you wouldn't answer
my calls and listen to reason.

122
00:09:07,122 --> 00:09:08,212
Let's be honest.

123
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:11,860
What else is there to talk about?

124
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,471
Please.

125
00:09:16,425 --> 00:09:18,717
You're all I have!

126
00:09:20,932 --> 00:09:22,676
I'm all you have, my ass.

127
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:26,220
You left me.

128
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,003
Always.

129
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:34,749
You're always like this.

130
00:09:36,224 --> 00:09:39,604
Always looking down on other people.

131
00:09:41,642 --> 00:09:44,045
Even if someone's in trouble,
you won't help.

132
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,587
You're so cold-hearted.

133
00:09:52,328 --> 00:09:53,868
That's not true.

134
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:55,095
Nakano?

135
00:09:56,455 --> 00:09:59,455
Senior Takara isn't cold-hearted.

136
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,800
He's unbelievably kind.

137
00:10:02,825 --> 00:10:03,825
Huh?

138
00:10:03,867 --> 00:10:04,983
Hey, Nakano...

139
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:08,076
When I was sad and cried,
he was kind to me.

140
00:10:08,584 --> 00:10:11,904
When I sprained my ankle,
he was there for me.

141
00:10:12,495 --> 00:10:15,838
- And he saved me from that crazy uncle.
- Crazy uncle?

142
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:16,849
He's...

143
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:20,949
always there when I'm in trouble.

144
00:10:21,518 --> 00:10:24,471
And he doesn't look down on anyone.

145
00:10:27,435 --> 00:10:29,290
For someone who knows nothing,

146
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:33,965
you shouldn't talk like
you've known him forever.

147
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,568
- Huh?
- And...

148
00:10:38,152 --> 00:10:41,210
he has a cold right now.

149
00:10:42,631 --> 00:10:44,112
I will take care of him.

150
00:10:44,391 --> 00:10:45,929
Are you done here?

151
00:10:48,558 --> 00:10:49,850
Did you hear that?

152
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,727
I understand what you want to say.

153
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,292
But quit hoping.

154
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,095
Don't come here again.

155
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:00,769
Is that so?

156
00:11:01,531 --> 00:11:03,229
You really are cold-blooded.

157
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:07,016
What did you say? He's not cold-blooded!

158
00:11:07,027 --> 00:11:08,725
Hey, take it easy.

159
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:12,621
Who is that woman?

160
00:11:16,023 --> 00:11:17,209
That person...

161
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,671
is my mother.

162
00:11:23,979 --> 00:11:24,979
Eh?

163
00:11:33,715 --> 00:11:35,227
Are you still worried?

164
00:11:37,495 --> 00:11:38,768
Well, I...

165
00:11:39,124 --> 00:11:43,133
was rude to your mother.

166
00:11:43,178 --> 00:11:44,255
Rude?

167
00:11:45,533 --> 00:11:48,793
- I'm gonna apologize to her right now.
- No need.

168
00:11:50,384 --> 00:11:52,019
Why did you come anyway?

169
00:11:55,774 --> 00:11:59,103
You said you had a cold.

170
00:11:59,512 --> 00:12:01,041
So I was worried.

171
00:12:02,185 --> 00:12:05,870
I bought a lot of things.
Vegetables and medicine.

172
00:12:07,683 --> 00:12:09,706
I'm just a little sore.

173
00:12:10,228 --> 00:12:12,101
You're more motherly than my mom.

174
00:12:13,595 --> 00:12:15,200
I'm sorry.

175
00:12:18,886 --> 00:12:19,886
Never mind.

176
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:24,006
Because my mother
never once did this for me.

177
00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:28,569
Eh?

178
00:12:30,622 --> 00:12:33,606
It's a boring story.
You don't need to hear it.

179
00:12:45,217 --> 00:12:46,284
I...

180
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:52,245
want to know everything about you.

181
00:13:03,747 --> 00:13:04,841
My parents...

182
00:13:06,882 --> 00:13:08,105
got a divorce.

183
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,802
This is getting out of hand.

184
00:13:10,929 --> 00:13:12,833
How much more do you need to be happy?!

185
00:13:12,996 --> 00:13:14,133
What did you say?

186
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,790
What if they call me poor?!

187
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:24,242
They kept fighting over
my mother's lavish spending.

188
00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:26,267
I never said that!

189
00:13:26,292 --> 00:13:29,805
- So their marriage deteriorated.
- Would you stop already?!

190
00:13:31,617 --> 00:13:32,617
But...

191
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:35,131
I can't take this anymore!

192
00:13:35,484 --> 00:13:40,384
The person who always got me out
of the house was my grandfather.

193
00:13:44,196 --> 00:13:45,702
Come on, drink this.

194
00:13:46,655 --> 00:13:48,001
What is it?

195
00:13:48,025 --> 00:13:50,098
Oh, you've never had this?

196
00:13:50,469 --> 00:13:52,565
- No.
- That won't do.

197
00:13:53,765 --> 00:13:56,889
It's Ramune,
the coolest drink in the world.

198
00:13:57,412 --> 00:13:59,811
Life isn't worth living without it.

199
00:14:01,345 --> 00:14:02,647
Look closely.

200
00:14:05,151 --> 00:14:06,776
Come on, try it.

201
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:12,582
Yummy.

202
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:22,400
There's something in the bottle.

203
00:14:22,425 --> 00:14:24,985
That thing? It's a marble.

204
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:30,952
It won't come out.

205
00:14:31,192 --> 00:14:32,035
Give it here.

206
00:14:33,031 --> 00:14:35,976
In the past, I just broke the bottles.

207
00:14:36,937 --> 00:14:37,937
Here.

208
00:14:42,228 --> 00:14:43,800
It's so shiny.

209
00:14:43,957 --> 00:14:45,809
What is it made of?

210
00:14:46,181 --> 00:14:47,479
It's made of glass.

211
00:14:47,884 --> 00:14:48,884
Glass?

212
00:14:56,349 --> 00:14:58,923
There's an upside-down sky inside.

213
00:14:59,696 --> 00:15:01,620
Really? Upside down?

214
00:15:02,342 --> 00:15:04,797
It's prettier than the ones Mom has.

215
00:15:05,408 --> 00:15:07,031
Is it very expensive?

216
00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:10,811
Mm, expensive things
aren't always beautiful.

217
00:15:11,507 --> 00:15:14,342
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

218
00:15:17,213 --> 00:15:19,313
Let's just say to your mother,

219
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:22,119
jewelry is beautiful.

220
00:15:22,318 --> 00:15:24,854
But to you, marbles are.

221
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:26,236
Hm.

222
00:15:28,704 --> 00:15:31,749
There's something I consider beautiful.

223
00:15:33,797 --> 00:15:36,021
Like your grandma in the sky.

224
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,918
The sky.

225
00:15:39,328 --> 00:15:40,378
The stars.

226
00:15:41,225 --> 00:15:43,665
And the mountains.

227
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,310
Mountains?

228
00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:46,743
That's right. Mountains.

229
00:15:47,384 --> 00:15:49,692
Next time I'll take you with me.

230
00:15:50,551 --> 00:15:51,247
Hm.

231
00:15:52,544 --> 00:15:54,000
My grandfather's...

232
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,186
always looking out for me.

233
00:15:59,373 --> 00:16:00,442
But...

234
00:16:08,312 --> 00:16:09,465
Mom.

235
00:16:10,331 --> 00:16:11,641
This is for you.

236
00:16:14,537 --> 00:16:17,808
It's a marble.
It's sparkling and beautiful.

237
00:16:24,863 --> 00:16:26,768
I don't want cheap things like this.

238
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,079
Then they divorced and my father raised me.

239
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:39,390
But she still shows up like that
to ask me for his money.

240
00:16:42,226 --> 00:16:44,076
Is that so?

241
00:16:45,848 --> 00:16:48,866
I had no idea.

242
00:16:49,862 --> 00:16:52,533
Never mind that.
Because I didn't tell anyone.

243
00:16:55,535 --> 00:16:59,045
I'm sorry for pestering you about it

244
00:17:00,661 --> 00:17:03,646
when it has nothing to do with me.

245
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,199
Sorry about yesterday.

246
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:15,577
One more thing.

247
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:19,979
You saved me by talking back
to my mom like that.

248
00:17:22,888 --> 00:17:23,888
Thank you.

249
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,623
There's something...

250
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:36,620
I have in common with her.

251
00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:39,509
Eh?

252
00:17:41,946 --> 00:17:44,369
So I've always hated it.

253
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,646
What do you two have in common?

254
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:53,730
I...

255
00:17:56,073 --> 00:17:57,800
Just like my mother...

256
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,281
When we want something, we...

257
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,000
Are you warm?

258
00:18:24,361 --> 00:18:25,361
Eh?

259
00:18:25,757 --> 00:18:26,757
Oh.

260
00:18:27,758 --> 00:18:31,606
There are things
that have been bothering me lately.

261
00:18:32,795 --> 00:18:34,409
So I've been losing sleep.

262
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:38,362
My brain feels kinda fuzzy.

263
00:18:43,503 --> 00:18:45,597
You've got a fever
over anxiety like a child.

264
00:18:46,304 --> 00:18:47,400
Put these on.

265
00:18:53,397 --> 00:18:54,783
His...

266
00:18:56,307 --> 00:18:57,778
clothes...

267
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,156
Here. Drink this.

268
00:19:03,454 --> 00:19:06,948
There's no need.
I already feel guilty as it is.

269
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:09,451
Just do it.

270
00:19:12,427 --> 00:19:13,730
Come on, put it on.

271
00:19:25,451 --> 00:19:26,686
Get some sleep.

272
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:36,092
I'm sorry.

273
00:19:38,215 --> 00:19:40,311
I came to take care of you.

274
00:19:40,453 --> 00:19:44,121
Now I'm the one being taken care of.

275
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:49,229
Sorry for making you worried.

276
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:53,870
Uh...

277
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:02,356
You're a kind person.

278
00:20:02,939 --> 00:20:04,294
What are you talking about?

279
00:20:16,626 --> 00:20:17,626
I...

280
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:24,201
I'm glad I got to meet you.

281
00:20:27,758 --> 00:20:29,854
I'm glad we met again.

282
00:20:31,651 --> 00:20:33,904
And I'm glad you've been kind to me.

283
00:20:35,006 --> 00:20:37,435
I'm really happy.

284
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:42,987
But I'm always nervous.

285
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:49,446
And I've kept causing you trouble.

286
00:20:50,521 --> 00:20:51,941
That's not true.

287
00:20:55,197 --> 00:20:56,747
I find it strange.

288
00:21:00,736 --> 00:21:02,220
You're...

289
00:21:03,935 --> 00:21:05,434
not my friend.

290
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,525
You're certainly not my family.

291
00:21:12,701 --> 00:21:15,528
Even though I saw you as my idol,

292
00:21:16,707 --> 00:21:19,107
it turned out that you weren't.

293
00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:23,689
So...

294
00:21:25,273 --> 00:21:27,605
what it is...

295
00:21:33,931 --> 00:21:36,207
that I'm feeling?

296
00:21:46,122 --> 00:21:48,779
What kind of affection is this?

297
00:21:52,608 --> 00:21:53,608
Nakano.

298
00:22:03,263 --> 00:22:04,963
You really are dumb.

299
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,679
(Next episode)
It's possible.

300
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,643
It wasn't a dream.

301
00:23:14,654 --> 00:23:16,490
I'd like to know more.

302
00:23:16,921 --> 00:23:21,460
You've become the junior
I don't know how to handle

303
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:23,505
or won't be able to handle.

304
00:23:26,737 --> 00:23:27,948
What should I do?

305
00:23:29,285 --> 00:23:33,210
If I want something,
I'll find a way to have it.

306
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:35,125
I'm sorry.
