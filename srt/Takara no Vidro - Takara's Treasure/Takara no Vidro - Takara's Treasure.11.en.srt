1
00:00:01,272 --> 00:00:04,390
You didn't forget anything, right?
Don't get lost, baby.

2
00:00:04,415 --> 00:00:05,415
Mm.

3
00:00:05,796 --> 00:00:09,890
But I'm already in my second year.
I don't get lost anymore.

4
00:00:10,075 --> 00:00:11,778
True, you're right.

5
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:16,171
Having said that, I feel like
we talked like this before.

6
00:00:16,196 --> 00:00:17,764
We did?

7
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,661
You told me Tokyo was scary.

8
00:00:21,832 --> 00:00:24,304
(Tomiko)
Yes, it is scary.

9
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:29,036
But Tokyo isn't as scary as you think.

10
00:00:30,325 --> 00:00:31,729
What about Senior Takara?

11
00:00:31,754 --> 00:00:32,854
Is he well?

12
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:37,784
He's hiking abroad right now.

13
00:00:38,446 --> 00:00:40,663
I haven't seen him in a while.

14
00:00:40,844 --> 00:00:42,184
Oh, is that so?

15
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:43,209
Mm.

16
00:00:43,396 --> 00:00:48,240
Ah, that's right, radishes.
If I send you extra, will he eat them?

17
00:00:48,943 --> 00:00:51,584
No need to send more radishes.

18
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,497
Talk to you later.

19
00:00:55,858 --> 00:00:56,858
Mm.

20
00:00:57,433 --> 00:00:58,507
Later.

21
00:01:09,252 --> 00:01:12,844
Time in Tokyo passes
in the blink of an eye.

22
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:18,489
I'm in my second year,
and Senior Takara is in his fourth.

23
00:01:20,257 --> 00:01:21,628
I've just realized

24
00:01:22,396 --> 00:01:29,173
soon my life with him
in university will end.

25
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,071
"Takara's Treasure"
(Spin off)

26
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:20,137
(Taishin's Turning 20)

27
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,556
This will be the freshmen's
first serious hike.

28
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,239
(Not just mountains. Conquer ourselves too.)
So there's training.

29
00:02:26,263 --> 00:02:29,259
Everyone, make sure
you have all the equipment.

30
00:02:29,622 --> 00:02:33,006
After that there's a hiking trip
after the summer break.

31
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:36,676
Nakano-kun, please explain
to the new kids what they should bring.

32
00:02:37,821 --> 00:02:38,905
- I will.
- Mm.

33
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:42,814
So let's end this meeting.
Thanks, everyone.

34
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:44,980
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

35
00:02:45,005 --> 00:02:48,056
Uh, I'll explain the equipment over here.

36
00:02:50,868 --> 00:02:53,359
When I went last time, it rained.

37
00:02:53,384 --> 00:02:57,688
So I think you should bring
a raincoat like this too.

38
00:02:58,313 --> 00:03:02,230
There's a good shop nearby.
I'll send you the shop's website.

39
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:04,557
- Thank you.
- Mm.

40
00:03:05,755 --> 00:03:07,903
- Hey.
- Are you joining us today?

41
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:10,939
Senior.

42
00:03:11,478 --> 00:03:15,587
I didn't think that Nakano would be
teaching younger students.

43
00:03:16,128 --> 00:03:18,933
But it doesn't suit you.
And what's that hairstyle?

44
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,529
Don't be rude.

45
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:23,089
The suit looks better than you.

46
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,440
I don't enjoy wearing it.

47
00:03:25,465 --> 00:03:28,074
Try wearing this
to apply for a job. It sucks.

48
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:31,615
- Senior Takara wearing a suit...
- Senior Takara wearing a suit...

49
00:03:31,827 --> 00:03:35,674
But Takara, you looked for work
over there. It's difficult, isn't it?

50
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:37,497
Well, to some extent.

51
00:03:37,522 --> 00:03:39,638
I wish I could speak English.

52
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:42,110
Oh, I almost forgot.

53
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:45,212
I returned the ice axe
I borrowed. Thank you.

54
00:03:45,236 --> 00:03:48,065
That's right. You said
you went hiking with your grandpa.

55
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:50,236
Where did you hike this time?

56
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:53,108
- Morocco.
- Don't tell me it was Toubkal.

57
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:55,715
- Yes.
- I'm so jealous.

58
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,718
We're all humans.
Where did I go wrong?

59
00:03:58,743 --> 00:04:01,766
This is not the time
to complain about that.

60
00:04:02,154 --> 00:04:03,718
Look at this.

61
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,628
(Resignation Form).
I've gotten used to these.

62
00:04:07,725 --> 00:04:12,861
Must've been too brutal for the girls
who'd had designs on Senior Takara.

63
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:16,255
When Takara graduates,
this club may be dissolved.

64
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:20,242
Alright. You guys,
I'll leave the club in your hands.

65
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:23,758
Hey, don't jinx it.

66
00:04:23,783 --> 00:04:27,673
Senior Takara is really popular.

67
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:29,133
It's your responsibility.

68
00:04:29,158 --> 00:04:30,336
I'm not involved.

69
00:04:30,695 --> 00:04:32,850
Other fourth-years
have to apply for jobs.

70
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,027
They're robably not free
to help recruit people.

71
00:04:35,052 --> 00:04:38,779
In the end, us fourth-year students
who are cursed to love mountains

72
00:04:38,803 --> 00:04:42,112
will take a break from job hunting
and join the club's activities.

73
00:04:42,137 --> 00:04:45,519
- I got the job. Don't involve me.
- Oh, you did?

74
00:04:46,346 --> 00:04:47,346
I'll off.

75
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:48,935
- Mm.
- See you later.

76
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,720
- I'm gonna go.
- See you later.

77
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,988
- See you.
- See you.

78
00:04:55,197 --> 00:04:57,649
Those two are so chummy.

79
00:04:57,673 --> 00:05:01,627
Yeah. Takara finally
found a friend he could talk to.

80
00:05:01,794 --> 00:05:04,414
What are you on about?
I'm his best friend.

81
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:05,772
Right?

82
00:05:06,536 --> 00:05:07,536
Sure.

83
00:05:07,881 --> 00:05:11,259
I have a secret I haven't told anyone.

84
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,171
It is...

85
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,951
(Stoic But Loving Senior and Junior
with a Rural Accent) this original novel.

86
00:05:18,604 --> 00:05:20,975
Right. It all started with...

87
00:05:21,524 --> 00:05:24,500
Nakano-kun's words
at last year's welcoming party.

88
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:27,878
They allowed me to witness
the most shocking scene.

89
00:05:34,477 --> 00:05:38,071
After that I couldn't sleep for days.

90
00:05:39,003 --> 00:05:42,346
The next thing I knew,
I'd begun logging their behaviors.

91
00:05:43,538 --> 00:05:45,045
Sorry, I have to take this.

92
00:05:47,437 --> 00:05:51,450
Let's get together and plan.

93
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:05,652
The problem is I secretly
started writing this novel

94
00:06:05,662 --> 00:06:07,701
to vent the feelings
I couldn't lock away.

95
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,203
The next thing I knew,
I'd gained quite a lot of readers.

96
00:06:11,856 --> 00:06:14,428
For my readers' sake,
I couldn't turn back.

97
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:15,775
(Awesome! Rooting for you!)

98
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,380
I need to collect more information.

99
00:06:23,246 --> 00:06:24,586
Senior Yui?

100
00:06:26,154 --> 00:06:28,142
Gee, Yukawa.

101
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:31,711
Eh? Why did you say "Gee"?

102
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:33,369
Finished all your classes?

103
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:35,470
Mm, I did. Why do you ask?

104
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,232
I'd like to leave with you.

105
00:06:37,257 --> 00:06:39,850
Uh, sorry, you can't.
I have something to do.

106
00:06:40,966 --> 00:06:43,538
Senior, don't say that.

107
00:06:55,037 --> 00:06:56,949
You can stay until Sunday, right?

108
00:06:57,235 --> 00:07:01,115
Yes, I brought textbooks for Monday.

109
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:04,558
We finally get to relax.

110
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,077
Well, you were there for three weeks.

111
00:07:10,981 --> 00:07:15,123
I feel like it's been a very long time.

112
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,900
I guess.

113
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,781
How was it?

114
00:07:22,196 --> 00:07:24,814
You don't get to hike
with your grandpa often.

115
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:27,936
There was very little snow left

116
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,492
but it felt good.

117
00:07:31,448 --> 00:07:32,682
Wanna see the pictures?

118
00:07:33,363 --> 00:07:34,373
I do.

119
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:48,988
Wow, awesome.

120
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,520
Isn't it beautiful?

121
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:53,718
I've never seen a view like this.

122
00:07:54,737 --> 00:07:57,885
I'd love to visit someday.

123
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:06,675
But I don't have a passport.

124
00:08:07,558 --> 00:08:10,568
And I have to increase my stamina first.

125
00:08:15,224 --> 00:08:18,612
Oh, right. Grandpa gave me souvenirs.

126
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:28,457
It's alcohol.

127
00:08:29,356 --> 00:08:30,996
You can't drink yet.

128
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,160
That's right. Because I'm not 20 yet.

129
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:42,941
Well, actually,

130
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:46,431
I can drink it tomorrow.

131
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:49,211
Huh? Is tomorrow your...

132
00:08:50,027 --> 00:08:51,071
Yes.

133
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,873
It's my birthday.

134
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,179
Why didn't you tell me?

135
00:08:57,902 --> 00:09:02,902
I thought it would seem arrogant
if I told you myself.

136
00:09:06,428 --> 00:09:08,509
You're talking like that again.

137
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,234
But you'll be 20...

138
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:13,673
tomorrow, right?

139
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:16,066
Yes.

140
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:21,526
So I'll do it tomorrow.

141
00:09:23,327 --> 00:09:24,327
Eh?

142
00:09:24,873 --> 00:09:29,914
I'll cook. I don't have anything
to give you. At least let me feed you.

143
00:09:32,207 --> 00:09:37,909
You're gonna cook for me? Am I dreaming?

144
00:09:39,859 --> 00:09:42,029
I'll check on you too when you're drunk.

145
00:09:44,764 --> 00:09:46,448
This won't do.

146
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,166
Total writer's block.

147
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,696
What should I write
to make it satisfying?

148
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:59,627
Wanna play on the swings together?

149
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:05,458
No, not like that. That's not it.

150
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,714
It looks delicious, right?

151
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:13,053
- Well.
- Oh, it startled me.

152
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,882
Eh, what the heck?

153
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:20,027
Strawberry and banana filling.

154
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:23,835
Let's sit and eat there.

155
00:10:23,969 --> 00:10:25,948
- They're coming.
- Sure.

156
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:32,139
Am I in luck or what?

157
00:10:34,511 --> 00:10:36,716
Hmm. So delicious.

158
00:10:37,657 --> 00:10:39,645
You have a sweet tooth.

159
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:44,081
I do. Sweets make me happy.

160
00:10:44,106 --> 00:10:46,261
Is that so?

161
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,592
Oh, would you like a bite?

162
00:10:50,655 --> 00:10:53,055
But you don't like sweets.

163
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:59,147
Eh? Wait a minute.

164
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,062
The story is moving too fast.

165
00:11:03,728 --> 00:11:07,198
I think you taste better than the crepe.

166
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,585
Eh?

167
00:11:10,861 --> 00:11:12,007
Senior?

168
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,317
Very sweet.

169
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:35,209
- Agh!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

170
00:11:35,451 --> 00:11:38,049
What are you doing here, Senior?

171
00:11:38,074 --> 00:11:39,884
- It's you.
- Yes.

172
00:11:40,892 --> 00:11:43,338
Your timing really sucks. Wait there.

173
00:11:43,363 --> 00:11:44,751
My timing sucks?

174
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,454
Eh?

175
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:48,702
Oh? Eh?

176
00:11:52,197 --> 00:11:53,657
Where are they?

177
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,708
What are you gonna cook for me?

178
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,683
My family always celebrates
special days with this dish.

179
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:12,234
I'm gonna make roast beef.

180
00:12:13,194 --> 00:12:14,861
Wow.

181
00:12:27,573 --> 00:12:28,573
Agh!

182
00:12:29,607 --> 00:12:33,264
- Huh?
- Senior, cutting that way is dangerous.

183
00:12:34,092 --> 00:12:35,092
How?

184
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,066
When you cut stuff,
shape your left hand like this.

185
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,879
Like a cat's paw. Meow.

186
00:12:43,131 --> 00:12:44,131
Meow?

187
00:12:44,653 --> 00:12:46,469
Please give me the knife.

188
00:12:50,638 --> 00:12:55,726
Bend your fingers like this
so you won't cut yourself.

189
00:12:58,097 --> 00:13:00,897
Here. You try.

190
00:13:06,975 --> 00:13:07,880
Like this?

191
00:13:07,905 --> 00:13:09,903
Yes. Good job.

192
00:13:11,383 --> 00:13:12,710
I see.

193
00:13:37,273 --> 00:13:38,513
Here you go.

194
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,583
Wow. This looks delicious.

195
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,088
But it took a bit of time.

196
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:58,080
My first beer.

197
00:13:59,101 --> 00:14:00,741
Tell me if you don't like it.

198
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:02,591
I will.

199
00:14:04,751 --> 00:14:05,853
So...

200
00:14:06,318 --> 00:14:07,630
happy birthday.

201
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:09,759
Thank you.

202
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:19,011
So bitter.

203
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:22,144
The first time is like this.

204
00:14:23,206 --> 00:14:27,167
So this is beer
that everyone enjoys drinking.

205
00:14:28,376 --> 00:14:30,748
There are many types of beer.

206
00:14:32,611 --> 00:14:33,941
Is that so?

207
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:42,809
But you're probably too young for beer.

208
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:44,883
Try drinking this.

209
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,799
What is it?

210
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:49,220
A fuzzy navel.

211
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:51,387
Probably more your speed.

212
00:14:57,124 --> 00:14:58,196
Hmm.

213
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,960
It's delicious. Just like fruit juice.

214
00:15:04,514 --> 00:15:07,592
Hey, it's easy to drink,
but don't drink the whole glass.

215
00:15:12,027 --> 00:15:13,224
Let's eat.

216
00:15:14,051 --> 00:15:15,160
Let's eat.

217
00:15:24,806 --> 00:15:26,657
Hmm, delicious.

218
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:29,491
Hmm.

219
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,430
Uh...

220
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:46,375
There's something
I've been keeping quiet.

221
00:15:47,902 --> 00:15:49,743
I'm sure of it today.

222
00:15:51,925 --> 00:15:53,008
Senior.

223
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:54,826
I like you.

224
00:15:55,869 --> 00:15:56,972
I like you.

225
00:15:58,643 --> 00:15:59,858
Please date me.

226
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:03,356
Please date me.

227
00:16:05,311 --> 00:16:07,327
Uh, Senior Yui, are you listening?

228
00:16:07,352 --> 00:16:10,070
Sorry, I don't have time to listen yet.

229
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:11,223
Oh.

230
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,299
I mustered up all my courage just now.

231
00:16:18,391 --> 00:16:20,070
But what are you doing?

232
00:16:20,095 --> 00:16:23,220
You're loud. Can you be quiet?
Things are getting heady.

233
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,199
I was the one following you here.

234
00:16:27,623 --> 00:16:28,791
Understood.

235
00:16:30,043 --> 00:16:31,119
I'll shut up.

236
00:16:32,372 --> 00:16:35,807
Before I forget this feeling.

237
00:16:44,761 --> 00:16:48,422
During the three weeks you went hiking,

238
00:16:48,447 --> 00:16:51,000
I tried very hard to wait.

239
00:16:51,025 --> 00:16:52,812
You've said that three times already.

240
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:54,792
I'll keep saying it.

241
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:57,562
Are you okay?

242
00:16:57,587 --> 00:17:01,076
How can I be okay?

243
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:04,820
Senior, are you listening?

244
00:17:05,611 --> 00:17:07,561
You're annoying when you're drunk.

245
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,295
Don't say I'm annoying.

246
00:17:13,994 --> 00:17:16,465
Damn it, I hear you.

247
00:17:19,386 --> 00:17:22,811
It's so good being this close.

248
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,795
Mm.

249
00:17:26,674 --> 00:17:29,774
Even though I acted normal
in front of everyone,

250
00:17:31,374 --> 00:17:35,982
but I was so lonely when you were away.

251
00:17:51,421 --> 00:17:52,499
Senior...

252
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,685
Remember what we talked about

253
00:18:00,238 --> 00:18:01,633
on the mountain that day?

254
00:18:07,968 --> 00:18:08,968
I...

255
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:13,930
want to be with you forever.

256
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:19,358
At the time...

257
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:24,780
I thought everything was gonna be okay.

258
00:18:27,337 --> 00:18:28,424
But...

259
00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:32,841
We were apart for just a short time.

260
00:18:34,506 --> 00:18:36,806
People can be so greedy.

261
00:18:56,741 --> 00:18:58,834
I used to think the same thing.

262
00:19:04,557 --> 00:19:05,557
Eh?

263
00:19:10,436 --> 00:19:15,653
In the end, the time difference made it
difficult for us to communicate with each other.

264
00:19:17,328 --> 00:19:19,648
So I thought it must've
made you lonely.

265
00:19:23,022 --> 00:19:24,084
But...

266
00:19:31,192 --> 00:19:34,605
Even though I might
make you lonely again...

267
00:19:41,332 --> 00:19:44,254
I'll want you to speak your mind.

268
00:19:51,943 --> 00:19:54,182
Because I want to be with you too.

269
00:20:09,428 --> 00:20:10,923
Hey, are you okay?

270
00:20:28,163 --> 00:20:29,163
Nakano?

271
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:39,316
I was talking about something serious.

272
00:21:21,268 --> 00:21:22,268
Good morning.

273
00:21:23,912 --> 00:21:25,473
Good morning.

274
00:21:27,137 --> 00:21:28,192
Remember anything?

275
00:21:31,087 --> 00:21:32,167
Uh...

276
00:21:33,106 --> 00:21:34,187
I...

277
00:21:34,424 --> 00:21:36,160
with you...

278
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:42,195
The only thing I understand clearly
is how you are when you're drunk.

279
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,803
Is this the effect of alcohol?

280
00:21:51,252 --> 00:21:53,392
But you've grown up a little.

281
00:21:58,718 --> 00:21:59,718
But it...

282
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,489
was fun.

283
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,770
Very fun.

284
00:22:12,246 --> 00:22:15,450
Take a shower
and let's go for a walk, Taishin.

285
00:22:17,072 --> 00:22:18,072
Yes.

286
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,584
Eh?

287
00:22:22,077 --> 00:22:23,687
What did you just say?

288
00:22:28,727 --> 00:22:30,408
Huh? What?

289
00:22:32,155 --> 00:22:34,938
Call me by my first name again.

290
00:22:37,927 --> 00:22:38,927
No way.

291
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,512
Eh? Please, I'm begging you.

292
00:22:41,537 --> 00:22:43,688
Just one more time, Senior.

293
00:22:47,396 --> 00:22:48,396
Senior?

294
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,540
Please.

295
00:22:52,195 --> 00:22:53,241
One more time.

296
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:54,605
Senior?

297
