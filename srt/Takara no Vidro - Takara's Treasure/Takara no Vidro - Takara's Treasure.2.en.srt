1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Senior, I'm sorry for making you wait.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
How was it?

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The doctor says it got a lot better.
I'm fine now.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Thank you for coming with me.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
No big deal. Plus the club president
kept pestering me.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Look, Takara. You have to take care
of Nakano-kun until his ankle's healed.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Why me?

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Don't argue.
This is the president's order.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Damn it.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It can't be helped.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Not like that.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Eh?

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'll let you hang onto my arm
until we reach the ropeway.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You don't need to.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I can hop with one leg to get there.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You can't do that.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Let's go.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm glad it's better.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Because I want to go hiking again.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Don't force yourself.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
If you get hurt again, I won't help you.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Come on. Let's go.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I never thought I'd be walking
with the person from back then.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You know your way home, right?

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Uh, yes.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I have to make a stop.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Bye.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
A general store?

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
He's laughing.

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
He's capable of making that face.

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
"Takara's Treasure"
(Episode 2)

32
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I haven't seen Akira lately.

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Is he doing well?

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah.

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yeah?

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Here. Thanks for coming.

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
- Mm.
- Mm.

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Who's that? Someone you know?

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That guy.

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What are you looking at?

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Uh, I'm sorry.

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I got a little curious.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You like fashion accessories?

44
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
No.

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You seem to like them more.

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Not exactly.

47
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But I thought I'd look better with them.

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Look better?

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I didn't want you to think

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I was lame when I finally found you.

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I don't like those flashy earrings.

52
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Eh?

53
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But someone like you...

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Those would suit you.

55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Those are...

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
diamonds?

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
They're glass.

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Wow.

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Glass can be so beautiful.

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Would they suit me?

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Your eyes...

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
My eyes?

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
No.

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Nothing.

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You can leave.

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Thank you very much.

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Hold on.

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
From now on, can I...

69
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
talk to you on campus?

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I guess so.

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Thank you.

72
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So I'll see you on campus.

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
That's not the way to your place.

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Eh?

75
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You live here?

76
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yes.

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Is that a good idea?

78
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Eh? Did something horrible happen here?

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That's the problem.

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
A klutz like you should live
in a place with auto locks.

81
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I changed schools at the last minute
so there weren't good places left.

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Oh, but it's clean inside.

83
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You wanna come in for tea?

84
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Don't be too trusting.

85
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Eh?

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Because someone who seems kind
might not really be kind.

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm off.

88
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
(Watch your step)

89
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yesterday Senior said something
I didn't quite understand.

90
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Ow.

91
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Does your leg hurt?

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But it's almost healed.

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Come on.

94
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Take a seat.

95
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Thank you very much.

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
A university student?

97
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yes. I just started.

98
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That's nice. Experiencing new things.

99
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
They gave me extra pork.

100
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Congrats.

101
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Tai-chan! Tai-chan!

102
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Tai-chan. Over here. Over here.

103
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Tai-chan?

104
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You mean me?

105
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yes. Tai-chan is short for Taishin.

106
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Sit here. Let's eat together.

107
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
- Come on, sit down.
- Mm.

108
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Please.

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Please take a seat.

110
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Tai-chan, did you pick a club?

111
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
- Think I'm gonna join the hiking club.
- Yeah?

112
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Oh, a handsome senior's in that club.

113
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Is it Senior Takara?
The freshies are talking about him.

114
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Is that so?

115
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But have you heard the rumor?

116
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What rumor?

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
They say last year's Miss Nakaba
has her eye set on Senior Takara.

118
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Eh?

119
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So he's really popular.
Because he's gorgeous.

120
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Oh. Is that so?

121
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Is Senior around here?

122
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
- Senior...
- Takara-kun.

123
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What are you doing?

124
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Uh...

125
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
They say last year's Miss Nakaba
has her eye set on Senior Takara.

126
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
They looked perfect for each other.

127
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Maybe...

128
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
he bought it for her.

129
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Hey.

130
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Oh, Nakano-kun.

131
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
How's your ankle?

132
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's getting better.

133
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Plus, Senior Takara
has been taking care of me.

134
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Taken care of by Senior Takara.

135
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm so jealous.

136
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
There we go again.

137
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Maybe it's his good karma.

138
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Good karma?

139
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Are you here to see Takara?

140
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Sorry, some girl called him away.

141
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I didn't know that. Was she Miss Nakaba?

142
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Who knows.

143
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm jealous he gets hit on
by someone that pretty.

144
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Will Senior Takara reciprocate?

145
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Please don't. I'm in shock.

146
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Hey, don't tell me
you have your eye on that girl.

147
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
No.

148
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I never dated anyone

149
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
so I don't really
understand these things.

150
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
That's so noble.

151
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Noble?

152
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
- Ignore her.
- What do you mean by that?

153
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Or is that considered strange?

154
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
These things are subjective.

155
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Just go at your own pace.

156
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Is he going to...

157
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
date her?

158
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Why wouldn't you date me?

159
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You're single right now.

160
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I think I'm good enough for you.

161
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
- So...
- You...

162
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
must see me as an object.

163
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I can't stand that kind of person.

164
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Cruel.

165
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
No wonder you've always been alone.

166
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Uh, Senior...

167
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That was the first time
I saw him making that face.

168
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Tai-chan, you're more
distracted than usual.

169
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You can say what's bothering you.

170
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Actually...

171
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
a senior who helped me in the past
doesn't look very happy,

172
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
so I want to do something for him.

173
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But I have no idea what to do.

174
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Mm.

175
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Maybe give him a present.

176
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Like a snack. Does he eat sweets?

177
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I have no idea.

178
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I don't know anything about him.

179
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Is there something he likes?

180
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Something he likes...

181
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Hey, Takara.

182
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Did you really say no to her?

183
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You're being annoying.

184
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What a shame.

185
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Why won't you date anyone?

186
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
My reason...

187
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
doesn't matter.

188
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Welcome.

189
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Oh, you're the kid hovering over
the window when Takara were here.

190
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Hovering?

191
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Are you Takara's friend?
But you don't look it.

192
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm not his friend.

193
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
But I'm his junior.

194
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Really? That's weird.

195
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
He has a soft spot for younger ones.

196
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
A soft spot?

197
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What brings you here today?

198
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I pick my own products,
so there are all kinds of stuff.

199
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Well...

200
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What did Senior Takara
buy the other day?

201
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
The other day?

202
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Oh! There were custom-made items.

203
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Do you mind telling me what they were?

204
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Eh?

205
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
When he bought them,
he was laughing with happiness.

206
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So I thought if I buy them for him,
he might feel better.

207
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
What? Does that guy look sad?

208
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Yes.

209
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That's why I'd like you to tell me.

210
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I see. I'll make an exception for you.

211
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Marbles?

212
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Yes, Takara likes glassware.

213
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I don't know why,
but he seems to love marbles.

214
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I see.

215
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
He's a kid at heart
despite his appearance.

216
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
He's collecting them.

217
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'd like to buy them.

218
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That was quick.

219
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'll wrap them for you.

220
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
He can be difficult,
but deep down he's a good guy.

221
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yes.

222
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
These earrings.

223
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Oh, those things. Pretty, aren't they?

224
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Do you like them?

225
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
- Try them on.
- I can?

226
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Mm. Use the mirror there.

227
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Wow.

228
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Eh?

229
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Perfect. They're perfect for you.

230
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You have an attractive face.

231
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Sometimes plain jewelry is enough.

232
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Attractive?

233
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Has no one ever told you
your eyes are very beautiful?

234
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
They're shiny like glass.

235
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
- Oh, don't stare at me.
- I can't?

236
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's not that.
It just feels like I'm being pulled in.

237
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Will he like them?

238
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You.

239
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
We meet again.

240
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
- Thank you for the other day.
- No need.

241
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm glad you remember.

242
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Doing some shopping today?

243
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yes.

244
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I bought a present

245
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
and these.

246
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I see. They look very good on you.

247
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Hey.

248
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Senior.

249
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Are you joining our club?
The president pestered me to ask you.

250
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Uh...

251
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Yes.

252
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Oh, right.
I have to submit an application.

253
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Give me your phone.

254
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's our club's group chat.

255
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
There'll be a welcoming party.
Say hi in there.

256
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm off.

257
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Uh, Senior.

258
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What?

259
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I want to give you something.

260
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Eh?

261
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Did I forget them?

262
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Huh?

263
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You're going straight home?

264
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Yes.

265
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm going that way anyway.

266
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'll stop by your place.

267
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Here.

268
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
For you.

269
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What is it?

270
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You've helped me with many things.

271
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And I came across
that incident the other day.

272
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I don't know how to explain it.

273
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
But I wanted you to smile.

274
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That blabbermouth.

275
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I asked him to tell me.

276
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Because you looked so happy
when you looked at marbles.

277
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I might not know anything about you.

278
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
But I wanted to cheer you up.

279
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Besides...

280
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
you're not alone, Senior.

281
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I wanted you to know that.

282
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Looks like the sky's in there, right?

283
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Eh?

284
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I had so much fun looking at them
when I was a kid.

285
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
So it became a habit.

286
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Thanks.

287
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You can have one.

288
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Thank you.

289
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Oh.

290
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I finally bought them.

291
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Do I look creepy wearing them?

292
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Mm.

293
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I thought so. I'm sorry.

294
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I've gotten to know him
a little better now.

295
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
(Next episode)
Something he finds interesting?

296
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Despite his appearance, he's attentive.
Keep on keeping on.

297
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Doesn't matter if they're men or women.
Just pick someone you can trust.

298
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Are you okay, Senior?

299
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
The messages you've been
sending were super lame.

300
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Lame?

301
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'll be right there.
