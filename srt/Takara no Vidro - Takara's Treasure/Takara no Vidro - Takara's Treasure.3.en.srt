1
00:00:11,853 --> 00:00:13,240
You can have one.

2
00:00:15,535 --> 00:00:17,240
Thank you.

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,500
I ended up accepting it from him.

4
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:49,660
I'm Nakano Taishin.

5
00:00:51,197 --> 00:00:54,955
Freshman.

6
00:00:56,418 --> 00:01:02,640
Please be kind.

7
00:01:05,862 --> 00:01:08,133
(I'm Nakano Taishin.
Freshman. Please be kind.)

8
00:01:08,158 --> 00:01:09,452
(Please be kind.)

9
00:01:10,164 --> 00:01:11,164
(bowing)

10
00:01:11,763 --> 00:01:13,301
Whoa.

11
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,633
Everyone replies so quickly.

12
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,580
We meet again.

13
00:01:30,793 --> 00:01:32,352
The guy from the other day.

14
00:01:32,983 --> 00:01:34,706
Did your ankle heal?

15
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:38,011
Yes, I'm fine now.

16
00:01:38,497 --> 00:01:39,863
Glad to hear that.

17
00:01:40,737 --> 00:01:43,390
What a kind man.

18
00:01:47,385 --> 00:01:48,447
Eh?

19
00:01:49,267 --> 00:01:50,267
Hm?

20
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:51,930
It came off.

21
00:01:51,962 --> 00:01:52,962
Eh?

22
00:01:54,142 --> 00:01:55,142
Ah.

23
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,187
If you don't mind...

24
00:01:58,953 --> 00:01:59,953
please use this.

25
00:02:01,897 --> 00:02:03,014
Thanks.

26
00:02:04,383 --> 00:02:06,526
You're such a good kid.

27
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:16,333
(Takara: Please be kind.)

28
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:06,279
"Takara's Treasure"
(Episode 3)

29
00:03:10,217 --> 00:03:14,357
We managed to shed a lot of freshmen
who had their eyes on you.

30
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,969
Anyway, Nakano is the kid who talked
to you at the orientation, right?

31
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:22,987
He joined our club.

32
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:26,121
(Taishin)

33
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:30,218
All right, consider it accepted.

34
00:03:30,675 --> 00:03:32,769
Sorry for the late submission.

35
00:03:32,794 --> 00:03:35,851
It's okay because
we haven't gotten many applications.

36
00:03:42,354 --> 00:03:45,829
The jackets you guys wore.

37
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:46,892
Hm?

38
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:49,948
Where can I buy one?

39
00:03:50,848 --> 00:03:57,020
Because I wanna have
hiking clothes and gear.

40
00:03:57,045 --> 00:04:00,060
Well, in this area...

41
00:04:02,724 --> 00:04:06,876
This shop also sells hiking gear.
Try there.

42
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:09,723
Wait.

43
00:04:10,372 --> 00:04:12,833
- This shop.
- Eh? You know it?

44
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:22,241
Oh.

45
00:04:23,668 --> 00:04:26,237
Oh, you're Takara's junior.

46
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:29,249
Well, why are you here?

47
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:30,869
Uh...

48
00:04:31,216 --> 00:04:35,876
I wanted hiking gear and the club
president recommended this shop.

49
00:04:52,634 --> 00:04:56,611
I can't tell which type works best.

50
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,389
What are you looking for?

51
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:04,984
I have no idea what to buy.

52
00:05:05,867 --> 00:05:08,988
The other day on the hike,
you were wearing a jacket, right?

53
00:05:09,404 --> 00:05:10,519
Yes.

54
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,247
What about t-shirts?

55
00:05:12,532 --> 00:05:13,532
Do you own any?

56
00:05:14,176 --> 00:05:15,176
Eh?

57
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:16,340
Quick dry ones.

58
00:05:18,471 --> 00:05:19,471
No.

59
00:05:20,984 --> 00:05:24,453
It's gonna be warm soon.
You have to own one.

60
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,096
Wow, this is surprising.

61
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,499
Takara acting like a senior.

62
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,591
Quit watching and take
care of the customers.

63
00:05:34,616 --> 00:05:38,238
His senior's already taking care of him.

64
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:39,824
Shut up.

65
00:05:40,414 --> 00:05:41,777
And stop slacking off.

66
00:05:41,802 --> 00:05:42,802
Yes, sir.

67
00:05:57,348 --> 00:06:00,050
Thank you for helping me pick.

68
00:06:00,075 --> 00:06:01,075
Mm.

69
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:04,114
I gotta go to my part-time job.

70
00:06:06,185 --> 00:06:07,185
Wait.

71
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,561
If I'm in trouble,

72
00:06:13,404 --> 00:06:16,076
do you mind if I contact you?

73
00:06:16,787 --> 00:06:17,943
What trouble?

74
00:06:21,742 --> 00:06:23,200
No idea.

75
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:26,080
I won't take ridiculous calls.

76
00:06:30,049 --> 00:06:34,848
Despite his appearance,
he's attentive. Keep trying.

77
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:36,367
Yes.

78
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,210
Here.

79
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,346
Thank you.

80
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,748
We meet again.

81
00:06:49,878 --> 00:06:50,878
Oh.

82
00:06:50,937 --> 00:06:53,363
What a coincidence.

83
00:06:53,722 --> 00:06:54,803
Today...

84
00:06:55,678 --> 00:06:57,315
you're out shopping again?

85
00:06:58,419 --> 00:06:59,419
Yes.

86
00:06:59,716 --> 00:07:01,789
I was with my senior just now.

87
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:03,128
Is that so?

88
00:07:03,713 --> 00:07:05,127
That sounds fun.

89
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:14,997
Is that so?

90
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:17,450
It's good you thanked him.

91
00:07:19,453 --> 00:07:23,126
I made a few friends.
And I joined a club.

92
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,054
And I got to talking with the shop owner

93
00:07:26,064 --> 00:07:29,167
and an uncle I met on a bus.

94
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,583
That's good, honey.

95
00:07:32,003 --> 00:07:36,255
But there aren't only
good people out there. Be careful.

96
00:07:36,466 --> 00:07:38,738
I know that.

97
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,141
But listen to me.

98
00:07:41,232 --> 00:07:44,038
The messages you've been
sending were super lame.

99
00:07:44,218 --> 00:07:46,025
Eh? Lame?

100
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:49,266
Instead of photos of mountains
and trees we already have here,

101
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,438
send photos that represent
the capital city.

102
00:07:54,137 --> 00:07:56,460
Represent the capital city?

103
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,903
Like what?

104
00:07:59,361 --> 00:08:00,361
Eh?

105
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:05,066
Like Naka-Meguro where celebrities live.

106
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,820
Naka-Meguro?

107
00:08:14,732 --> 00:08:17,863
Hey, what's with the message
you just sent me?

108
00:08:17,888 --> 00:08:18,888
Eh?

109
00:08:18,946 --> 00:08:21,106
Don't send me weird stuff during class.

110
00:08:21,193 --> 00:08:22,358
What did you send?

111
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,160
This.

112
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:28,372
- What's this?
- Eh?

113
00:08:28,397 --> 00:08:30,744
I sent a message as an uncle for fun.

114
00:08:30,825 --> 00:08:34,994
It's super creepy.
You should focus on the class.

115
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:36,019
Well.

116
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:38,964
- You're not one for small talk, Mei.
- Mm.

117
00:08:39,082 --> 00:08:41,198
You always use "Copy that" stickers.

118
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,270
There wasn't a topic to discuss.

119
00:08:43,985 --> 00:08:47,092
Topics don't just happen naturally.

120
00:08:48,538 --> 00:08:49,818
We have to create them.

121
00:08:50,723 --> 00:08:52,303
She says with such pride.

122
00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:57,237
There are a lot of things
the other person finds interesting.

123
00:08:57,872 --> 00:08:59,949
That's because you're hyperactive.

124
00:09:00,725 --> 00:09:01,725
Right?

125
00:09:02,128 --> 00:09:03,128
Eh?

126
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,700
Mm.

127
00:09:08,892 --> 00:09:12,900
Things the other person
finds interesting?

128
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:24,761
You always eat that.
Aren't you sick of it?

129
00:09:25,258 --> 00:09:26,404
Not at all.

130
00:09:26,688 --> 00:09:29,239
- You also got your usual.
- Eh?

131
00:09:29,531 --> 00:09:32,938
- I feel I'm getting famous.
- For what?

132
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:34,018
Ramen.

133
00:09:44,135 --> 00:09:46,060
Skateboards.

134
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:50,667
(Best Hiking Spots Around the Country)

135
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:52,334
Mountains.

136
00:09:52,974 --> 00:09:54,540
Coffee.

137
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:29,028
(Taishin: I'm in. Please be kind.)

138
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,231
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

139
00:10:33,255 --> 00:10:35,525
Little bro, heading home already?

140
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,850
Come drink with us.

141
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,670
Don't you have things to do?

142
00:10:38,695 --> 00:10:41,448
You're always working.
You never go out with us.

143
00:10:41,473 --> 00:10:42,473
He's right.

144
00:10:43,277 --> 00:10:45,673
All right, I hear you. I'll go.

145
00:10:47,741 --> 00:10:48,741
Get off me.

146
00:10:48,974 --> 00:10:50,149
What's wrong with this?

147
00:11:10,305 --> 00:11:13,747
Such beautiful blossoms.

148
00:11:19,217 --> 00:11:22,959
Should I send this to him?

149
00:11:24,107 --> 00:11:25,213
Wait.

150
00:11:25,712 --> 00:11:27,185
But it's lame, isn't it?

151
00:11:32,624 --> 00:11:33,937
We meet again.

152
00:11:35,685 --> 00:11:37,278
Haven't had dinner, have you?

153
00:11:38,145 --> 00:11:40,573
You must feel dismayed
living in Tokyo by yourself.

154
00:11:41,122 --> 00:11:43,970
I just bought you grilled chicken.

155
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:47,386
If you don't mind,
can I go to your apartment?

156
00:11:47,996 --> 00:11:48,996
Eh?

157
00:11:53,886 --> 00:11:54,886
I don't think so.

158
00:11:55,687 --> 00:11:56,687
Uh...

159
00:11:58,436 --> 00:11:59,761
I'm gonna go.

160
00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:38,367
Eh?

161
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,126
What's wrong?

162
00:12:41,071 --> 00:12:42,175
Are you okay?

163
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:47,716
Come on.
Let's have grilled chicken together.

164
00:12:48,964 --> 00:12:49,964
Please.

165
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,710
Hey!

166
00:13:02,922 --> 00:13:05,037
I wanna be popular.

167
00:13:06,402 --> 00:13:08,397
What do I have to do to be popular?

168
00:13:08,408 --> 00:13:11,521
Move to a country
filled with popular people.

169
00:13:11,546 --> 00:13:13,172
I can't afford that!

170
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,820
Hey, Takara, any suggestions?

171
00:13:16,526 --> 00:13:17,670
Keep trying.

172
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,610
Hey, don't just say that.

173
00:13:19,755 --> 00:13:24,271
Don't you have a cheaper way
for me to get popular, teacher?

174
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,992
(Nakano Taishin)
Mm, let's see.

175
00:13:28,883 --> 00:13:31,810
Maybe move to Turkey? I heard
the Japanese find them attractive.

176
00:13:31,821 --> 00:13:34,222
Wait, why do I have to
move to another country?

177
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:36,314
- Will that work? Who would do it?
- Why not?

178
00:13:36,325 --> 00:13:37,325
What's up?

179
00:13:40,671 --> 00:13:42,312
Hey, can you hear me?

180
00:13:43,191 --> 00:13:45,718
Oh, uh, senior.

181
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,413
Well, right now...

182
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:51,716
there's this uncle...

183
00:13:52,773 --> 00:13:53,773
Huh?

184
00:13:54,704 --> 00:13:56,982
There's this uncle...

185
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,896
asking to come in my apartment.

186
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:03,296
He's been standing outside.

187
00:14:03,966 --> 00:14:04,966
For real?

188
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,146
Is he dangerous?

189
00:14:08,202 --> 00:14:09,202
No.

190
00:14:10,248 --> 00:14:12,409
He's not dangerous per se.

191
00:14:17,032 --> 00:14:18,234
But I'm...

192
00:14:19,105 --> 00:14:20,105
afraid.

193
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:24,897
- Gotta go.
- Hey!

194
00:14:25,138 --> 00:14:28,189
Was that a girl, sir?
Did a girl call you, Takara-san?

195
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:29,535
Was that a girl, sir?!

196
00:14:33,392 --> 00:14:34,630
I'm on my way.

197
00:14:35,144 --> 00:14:36,634
Don't open the door.

198
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:39,398
I'll be right there.

199
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,430
Hang in there.

200
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,419
I will.

201
00:15:12,158 --> 00:15:13,463
What's wrong?

202
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,265
The chicken will go cold.

203
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:48,535
Well...

204
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:52,243
You finally answered.

205
00:15:54,863 --> 00:15:56,044
Well...

206
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:02,066
You showing up at my place like this...

207
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,207
To be honest...

208
00:16:06,355 --> 00:16:08,890
it makes me uncomfortable.

209
00:16:09,006 --> 00:16:10,108
Eh?

210
00:16:10,373 --> 00:16:11,554
Why?

211
00:16:13,525 --> 00:16:17,620
You were willing to open up to me.

212
00:16:18,528 --> 00:16:21,068
And you gave me that kind of smile.

213
00:16:23,188 --> 00:16:24,701
It'll be okay.

214
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,838
Open the door for me, please.

215
00:16:42,745 --> 00:16:43,745
Uncle.

216
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:48,786
Why are you here?

217
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:50,888
Well.

218
00:16:51,146 --> 00:16:53,647
I was just asking him
to have dinner with me.

219
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:56,058
Put yourself in his shoes.

220
00:16:56,786 --> 00:16:58,701
The guy in there is afraid of you.

221
00:17:00,246 --> 00:17:01,246
Eh?

222
00:17:01,345 --> 00:17:02,745
If you keep this up,

223
00:17:03,336 --> 00:17:04,611
I'll call the police.

224
00:17:05,969 --> 00:17:07,805
That wasn't my intention.

225
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,555
You find me that disgusting?

226
00:17:20,827 --> 00:17:22,030
Is that true?

227
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,327
I'm sorry.

228
00:17:48,055 --> 00:17:49,402
You can open the door.

229
00:18:05,905 --> 00:18:06,914
Hey.

230
00:18:08,276 --> 00:18:09,369
Are you okay?

231
00:18:13,082 --> 00:18:14,770
You must have been terrified.

232
00:18:16,901 --> 00:18:18,241
Let's get inside.

233
00:18:31,887 --> 00:18:33,117
Senior...

234
00:18:33,722 --> 00:18:36,198
You stink of booze.

235
00:18:38,938 --> 00:18:40,790
Is that the first thing you say to me?

236
00:18:42,636 --> 00:18:44,851
You're lucky I was drinking nearby.

237
00:18:47,872 --> 00:18:49,171
I'm sorry.

238
00:18:51,154 --> 00:18:52,643
The next thing I knew,

239
00:18:53,447 --> 00:18:55,094
I was already calling you.

240
00:19:00,164 --> 00:19:02,060
Do you know that uncle?

241
00:19:04,008 --> 00:19:05,008
Uh...

242
00:19:07,089 --> 00:19:08,158
Lately,

243
00:19:09,141 --> 00:19:12,441
we've been running into each other
on the bus or a sidewalk.

244
00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:16,092
So we started talking.

245
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:20,965
He's a classic stalker.

246
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,079
He's been targeting you.

247
00:19:28,149 --> 00:19:33,311
And if I were anything like him,
I would've already taken care of you.

248
00:19:38,374 --> 00:19:39,611
But I'm...

249
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,559
a man.

250
00:19:43,178 --> 00:19:45,660
Some men find other men attractive.

251
00:19:48,107 --> 00:19:49,976
Is that so?

252
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:55,862
Some would misunderstand you
even when you've done nothing wrong.

253
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:01,566
Doesn't matter if they're men or women.
Just pick someone you can trust.

254
00:20:08,603 --> 00:20:09,603
So...

255
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:16,612
I can pick you?

256
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,580
Don't know.

257
00:20:27,653 --> 00:20:30,070
Just don't talk to strangers.

258
00:20:31,936 --> 00:20:33,415
Well, I was...

259
00:20:34,954 --> 00:20:37,853
happy he praised me about my earrings.

260
00:20:37,947 --> 00:20:38,947
Huh?

261
00:20:39,193 --> 00:20:41,193
You're so gullible.

262
00:20:41,218 --> 00:20:42,218
Eh?

263
00:20:55,764 --> 00:20:56,867
Senior!

264
00:21:00,275 --> 00:21:01,474
Well...

265
00:21:03,465 --> 00:21:06,296
Thank you very much for yesterday.

266
00:21:07,253 --> 00:21:08,253
Mm.

267
00:21:09,178 --> 00:21:13,518
I was hesitant about what I
should talk about with you over text,

268
00:21:13,795 --> 00:21:17,191
but I ended up starting out
by calling you about yesterday.

269
00:21:18,148 --> 00:21:19,928
If yesterday didn't happen,

270
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,351
what would you have sent me?

271
00:21:28,379 --> 00:21:30,840
I wanted to send you this.

272
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:32,972
A pot marigold?

273
00:21:33,658 --> 00:21:36,678
You really are a senior. You're awesome.

274
00:21:37,614 --> 00:21:38,823
Are you insulting me?

275
00:21:39,379 --> 00:21:40,379
Eh?

276
00:21:46,143 --> 00:21:47,407
At the time...

277
00:21:48,665 --> 00:21:52,558
I was so terrified I couldn't think.

278
00:21:55,371 --> 00:21:59,411
The next thing I knew,
I was already calling him.

279
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,225
If it's this stuff,

280
00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:06,170
I can send it to you?

281
00:22:06,195 --> 00:22:07,469
You're a pest.

282
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:10,325
Eh? So what am I allowed to send you?

283
00:22:11,126 --> 00:22:12,151
Don't know.

284
00:22:12,376 --> 00:22:13,464
Eh?

285
00:22:14,057 --> 00:22:16,462
The person I thought of...

286
00:22:17,443 --> 00:22:21,203
wasn't anyone else, but only him.

287
00:23:13,874 --> 00:23:18,409
(Next episode)
I might be fanboying for him right now.

288
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:22,000
When did our relationship
turn into that?

289
00:23:22,082 --> 00:23:25,981
So what is this I'm feeling, senior?

290
00:23:29,043 --> 00:23:31,003
It might not be a laughing matter.

291
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:31,958
Eh?

292
00:23:31,969 --> 00:23:36,220
The sorrow from losing one's idol
cannot be healed.

293
00:23:36,365 --> 00:23:37,365
Are you free?

294
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:38,800
Eh?
