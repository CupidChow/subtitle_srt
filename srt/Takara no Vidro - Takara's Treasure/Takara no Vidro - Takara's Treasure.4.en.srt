1
00:00:00,617 --> 00:00:03,168
So I consulted Kenzo as well.

2
00:00:03,665 --> 00:00:07,903
But if I attend that concert,
I might not make it to class in time.

3
00:00:07,928 --> 00:00:10,839
I'll tell you later whose concert it is.

4
00:00:10,864 --> 00:00:11,870
(Emiri)

5
00:00:11,895 --> 00:00:15,475
The point is, I need someone
cover for me at the roll call.

6
00:00:15,499 --> 00:00:18,340
But if this gets out, I'll be screwed.

7
00:00:18,365 --> 00:00:19,365
Mm.

8
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:24,847
If I act like this as a freshman, I
might not get to be a sophomore.

9
00:00:27,675 --> 00:00:29,363
Eh? Tai-chan, are you listening?

10
00:00:33,548 --> 00:00:34,720
Emiri.

11
00:00:34,944 --> 00:00:38,482
What should I wear to the welcome party?

12
00:00:40,322 --> 00:00:42,377
Dressed how you're usually dressed.

13
00:00:42,402 --> 00:00:45,429
Oh, my bus's here. Gotta go.

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,002
Eh?

15
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,824
(Takara: Don't say anything weird today)
Huh?

16
00:00:58,849 --> 00:01:00,661
Say something weird?

17
00:01:04,168 --> 00:01:06,093
Oh, I'm late!

18
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:08,256
Oh!

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,950
I accidentally sent a weird sticker.
What do I do?

20
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,470
(Taishin: Chirping)
What is this?

21
00:02:26,964 --> 00:02:32,901
"Takara's Treasure"
(Episode 4)

22
00:02:45,676 --> 00:02:46,676
I'm late.

23
00:02:48,413 --> 00:02:49,547
Where is it?

24
00:02:50,527 --> 00:02:52,604
Where is this shop?

25
00:02:58,081 --> 00:02:59,363
Is it there?

26
00:03:16,635 --> 00:03:19,430
Oh, Nakano-kun! Nakano-kun has arrived.

27
00:03:19,455 --> 00:03:22,354
Oh, it's you.
You're smaller than what I heard.

28
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,589
So cute. Are you dating anyone?

29
00:03:24,614 --> 00:03:25,887
Uh, I...

30
00:03:25,911 --> 00:03:28,211
Hey, don't talk at him all at once.

31
00:03:28,236 --> 00:03:29,618
He can't answer you all.

32
00:03:29,653 --> 00:03:31,943
- Come sit here.
- Go sit.

33
00:03:34,766 --> 00:03:36,400
What do you want? Can you drink alcohol?

34
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:39,264
He's a minor. Order him a soda pop.

35
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:40,289
That's right.

36
00:03:41,282 --> 00:03:42,945
Well? What drink do you want?

37
00:03:43,093 --> 00:03:44,186
Yes.

38
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,361
- This is delicious.
- It's delicious.

39
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:51,159
Eat up.

40
00:03:51,184 --> 00:03:54,155
- I want alcohol too.
- Mm, me too.

41
00:03:55,366 --> 00:03:56,722
Wanna order more?

42
00:04:02,982 --> 00:04:08,100
I wanna climb Mount Kilimanjaro
before I graduate. What do you think?

43
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,220
It's good. I already did it.

44
00:04:10,245 --> 00:04:11,322
For real?

45
00:04:11,347 --> 00:04:13,213
Mm, in high school.

46
00:04:13,237 --> 00:04:15,860
The Marangu route has mountain huts.

47
00:04:15,885 --> 00:04:18,445
If you're careful about
altitude sickness, you can do it.

48
00:04:18,474 --> 00:04:21,673
There's also a safari.
Many cool animals. You'll love it.

49
00:04:21,698 --> 00:04:23,004
Yeah?

50
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:26,216
I learn new things when I consult with you.

51
00:04:26,613 --> 00:04:28,426
We have to get the check soon.

52
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,600
He's really cool.

53
00:04:32,762 --> 00:04:35,472
I heard the rumor so I'm curious.

54
00:04:35,497 --> 00:04:37,821
Did you really follow Takara here?

55
00:04:37,846 --> 00:04:39,140
You decided based on that?

56
00:04:39,165 --> 00:04:41,000
There's nothing wrong with it.

57
00:04:41,025 --> 00:04:45,266
We have different motivations.
Even I followed him to this club.

58
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,083
But if that's the only reason,
then it's like falling in love.

59
00:04:48,094 --> 00:04:49,746
- That's true.
- Right?

60
00:04:49,771 --> 00:04:50,771
Right?

61
00:04:53,023 --> 00:04:55,294
Some men find other men attractive.

62
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,151
Well...

63
00:05:03,363 --> 00:05:08,026
Is it true that
some men find other men attractive?

64
00:05:09,429 --> 00:05:10,429
Eh?

65
00:05:10,842 --> 00:05:12,057
- What do you mean?
- Eh?

66
00:05:12,068 --> 00:05:15,624
Uh, no. It's not that deep.

67
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:16,901
I just...

68
00:05:16,926 --> 00:05:19,819
So innocent. How adorable.

69
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,109
What was that signal?

70
00:05:28,134 --> 00:05:29,735
- The shhh?
- I saw it.

71
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,613
Now I'm curious.
What's going on between you and him?

72
00:05:34,528 --> 00:05:37,508
See? He's shut his mouth now.
Hey, Takara!

73
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,250
Hey, Takara!

74
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,427
- Takara!
- Jeez!

75
00:05:41,437 --> 00:05:44,414
People can like whoever they want!

76
00:05:44,715 --> 00:05:46,215
Like I like mountains.

77
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,197
It's Nakano-kun's business who he likes.

78
00:05:49,222 --> 00:05:50,423
Right?

79
00:05:51,624 --> 00:05:52,753
I see.

80
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:55,977
Attraction comes in many forms.

81
00:05:56,014 --> 00:05:57,159
Are you guys drinking?

82
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,850
It's rare to see
Minami-san drunk like this.

83
00:06:00,821 --> 00:06:05,101
So what is this I'm feeling?

84
00:06:08,917 --> 00:06:11,058
Madly in love.

85
00:06:11,082 --> 00:06:12,745
Has you fallen in love, Emiri?

86
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:14,923
That's right.

87
00:06:14,948 --> 00:06:18,524
The visual of "Ruirui"
this time is amazing.

88
00:06:18,549 --> 00:06:20,464
Visual? Ruirui?

89
00:06:20,489 --> 00:06:22,032
It means attractive.

90
00:06:22,057 --> 00:06:23,431
Hey, look at this.

91
00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:29,339
Colorful Diamond?
I think I've heard of them.

92
00:06:29,364 --> 00:06:32,033
Wow, he's so cool.

93
00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:33,308
Right?

94
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,426
When I studied for entrance exams
and got sad after coming to Tokyo,

95
00:06:37,451 --> 00:06:39,628
Ruirui helped me get through it.

96
00:06:39,653 --> 00:06:41,689
Oh, you might like...

97
00:06:41,714 --> 00:06:43,631
And he has a catch phrase.

98
00:06:45,328 --> 00:06:47,288
"Obsessed with improving myself.

99
00:06:47,313 --> 00:06:49,630
The bright center, Furukawa Rui.

100
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,940
Glittering rays!"

101
00:06:58,015 --> 00:07:00,406
Now I'm afraid. What's with him?

102
00:07:01,122 --> 00:07:03,477
- Oh, Senior Akira.
- Hey.

103
00:07:04,586 --> 00:07:07,642
Don't tell me you love Color Di.
I love them too.

104
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:09,690
Eh? We stan the same band?

105
00:07:09,715 --> 00:07:12,410
Yes, I just went to
their concert the other day.

106
00:07:12,445 --> 00:07:15,990
I went too. Ruirui is so cool.

107
00:07:16,015 --> 00:07:17,930
He is. He's super cool.

108
00:07:17,955 --> 00:07:19,510
Their songs are also inspiring.

109
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:22,115
Mains give us goals in life.

110
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:23,342
Mains?

111
00:07:23,624 --> 00:07:25,028
Mains are...

112
00:07:25,675 --> 00:07:28,015
Hm, how should I explain it?

113
00:07:28,927 --> 00:07:32,250
A main is the only person
we keep thinking about.

114
00:07:32,275 --> 00:07:34,771
And we want them to be happy.

115
00:07:35,076 --> 00:07:37,151
It's like premium love.

116
00:07:37,784 --> 00:07:41,525
A man can have a male main?

117
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,090
Sure. There's no gender discrimination
when it comes to mains.

118
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:49,250
To me, Ruirui is cool and admirable.

119
00:07:50,698 --> 00:07:52,610
I see.

120
00:08:02,895 --> 00:08:08,930
Someone cool and admirable?

121
00:08:16,743 --> 00:08:18,149
Core muscles...

122
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:23,110
I'm sorry.

123
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,214
What got you so distracted?
It's dangerous.

124
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:31,890
I got distracted thinking about "mains."

125
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:33,638
Huh?

126
00:08:34,072 --> 00:08:36,378
Oh, nothing.

127
00:08:36,848 --> 00:08:39,324
Are you going home, Senior?

128
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,553
Well, not really.

129
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,286
Where are you going?

130
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,238
Why do I have to
report everything to you?

131
00:08:46,574 --> 00:08:47,721
Are you my wife?

132
00:08:48,976 --> 00:08:50,376
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:54,996 --> 00:08:56,272
Are you free?

134
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,208
Eh?

135
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,000
Yes, I have nothing but time.

136
00:09:12,924 --> 00:09:14,703
I can't do it..

137
00:09:16,394 --> 00:09:18,414
Your core is too weak.

138
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:21,720
If you're not fit,
you'll get hurt during hikes.

139
00:09:22,821 --> 00:09:23,821
Yes.

140
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,148
Take a break.

141
00:09:28,054 --> 00:09:29,639
Thank you.

142
00:09:29,664 --> 00:09:32,599
I'll show you another exercise.

143
00:09:52,095 --> 00:09:54,512
So cool.

144
00:09:56,431 --> 00:10:02,930
Maybe I see him as my main.

145
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,326
(Emiri's Lesson on Mains)

146
00:10:07,143 --> 00:10:11,573
I will give you important points
about "being a stan."

147
00:10:11,795 --> 00:10:13,112
Remember them well.

148
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,547
Yes.

149
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,589
One, a main is noble.

150
00:10:17,975 --> 00:10:22,822
We will only think about our main
and want to know everything about them.

151
00:10:24,293 --> 00:10:26,106
Noble.

152
00:10:28,489 --> 00:10:32,223
Excuse me. Could you please
tell me how to get to this station?

153
00:10:34,195 --> 00:10:35,805
Oh, sure.

154
00:10:36,193 --> 00:10:39,529
Go straight on. And
then turn right at the bank.

155
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:42,765
You'll see the station
on your right. Good enough?

156
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,690
- Got it. Thank you.
- No problem. Where are you from?

157
00:10:45,715 --> 00:10:48,674
- I'm from...
- So cool.

158
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:51,301
Two,

159
00:10:51,312 --> 00:10:57,245
use the same items to understand
our main better and enjoy being a stan.

160
00:10:57,737 --> 00:10:59,526
The same items.

161
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,517
Excuse me.

162
00:11:54,065 --> 00:11:58,801
He's using this brand of water bottles?

163
00:12:00,306 --> 00:12:01,306
Three,

164
00:12:01,317 --> 00:12:05,258
it's a stan's duty to live our life
without getting our main in trouble.

165
00:12:05,886 --> 00:12:08,360
Don't get our main in trouble.

166
00:12:09,177 --> 00:12:09,896
Got it.

167
00:12:22,047 --> 00:12:23,697
What's with him?

168
00:12:29,184 --> 00:12:33,109
Must not get him in trouble.

169
00:12:37,762 --> 00:12:41,912
Being a stan is so fun.

170
00:12:44,236 --> 00:12:47,100
Because I get to know
all sorts of things about him.

171
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:53,002
But if Okame-kun were here,
we would've had so much fun.

172
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,670
Eh?

173
00:13:09,662 --> 00:13:10,422
Emiri.

174
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:11,814
Not yet.

175
00:13:12,514 --> 00:13:13,581
Eh?

176
00:13:13,605 --> 00:13:15,858
You saw the news about
his withdrawal I sent you?

177
00:13:16,782 --> 00:13:17,782
Mm.

178
00:13:19,283 --> 00:13:24,293
The sorrow from losing one's main
cannot be healed.

179
00:13:27,442 --> 00:13:31,663
I can't live
in the world without Ruirui.

180
00:13:32,992 --> 00:13:34,339
I'm starving.

181
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,274
Oh, sorry.

182
00:13:40,156 --> 00:13:41,274
What happened?

183
00:13:41,285 --> 00:13:42,342
I'll tell you later.

184
00:13:43,648 --> 00:13:46,490
Sorry, I need to be alone for a while.

185
00:13:51,727 --> 00:13:52,727
Emiri.

186
00:13:54,775 --> 00:13:59,255
(Colorful Diamond's Furukawa Rui
Announces His Withdrawal from the Band)

187
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:11,668
Hey.

188
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,220
What's with you lately? Why are you
secretly following me around?

189
00:14:17,001 --> 00:14:18,309
I'm your stan.

190
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:19,825
Huh?

191
00:14:20,436 --> 00:14:24,138
There's a rule that a stan must not
interfere with their main's life, so I...

192
00:14:24,162 --> 00:14:26,056
What exactly is a main?

193
00:14:29,003 --> 00:14:30,396
I...

194
00:14:31,177 --> 00:14:33,567
admire you, Senior.

195
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:38,444
So I thought you were my main.

196
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:43,584
When did our relationship
turn into that?

197
00:14:45,836 --> 00:14:46,914
But...

198
00:14:49,008 --> 00:14:53,940
So what is this I'm feeling, senior?

199
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,190
Huh?

200
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,910
Hey, have you seen Emiri-chan?

201
00:15:04,214 --> 00:15:05,303
I haven't.

202
00:15:05,342 --> 00:15:07,324
We haven't been able to contact her.

203
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,993
She looked so down, so we thought
she might do something shortsighted.

204
00:15:18,955 --> 00:15:22,731
Where is she? Or did she leave campus?

205
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,507
Does anyone know where she lives?

206
00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:26,212
We don't have the address.

207
00:15:26,775 --> 00:15:30,120
But aren't we being dramatic?
It's just one idol.

208
00:15:30,202 --> 00:15:32,168
She might be home sleeping.

209
00:15:32,193 --> 00:15:33,593
It's a very big deal.

210
00:15:34,428 --> 00:15:38,103
Her main is very important to her.

211
00:15:38,113 --> 00:15:39,626
He's a part of her life.

212
00:15:39,651 --> 00:15:41,309
For real?

213
00:15:41,832 --> 00:15:43,500
Maybe I should get a main.

214
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:51,789
It might not be a laughing matter.

215
00:15:58,701 --> 00:15:59,701
Eh?

216
00:16:05,785 --> 00:16:06,968
Emiri!

217
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,341
Calm down! Don't be reckless!

218
00:16:09,538 --> 00:16:12,201
I didn't realize
it was this serious for you. I'm sorry!

219
00:16:12,226 --> 00:16:13,614
Come back in!

220
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,862
I don't wanna lose a friend
I just got close to!

221
00:16:18,113 --> 00:16:19,644
- Emiri!
- Wait!

222
00:16:19,669 --> 00:16:20,860
Why are you stopping me?

223
00:16:20,885 --> 00:16:23,709
Emiri might jump.

224
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:25,519
No, look closely.

225
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:29,470
Maybe she's...

226
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:42,289
♪ Like cherry pink ♪

227
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:45,059
♪ The beginning of love ♪

228
00:16:50,286 --> 00:16:52,838
Eh? What is everyone doing here?

229
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:02,791
Here.

230
00:17:03,942 --> 00:17:05,209
Thank you.

231
00:17:07,304 --> 00:17:09,027
I'm sorry for worrying you guys.

232
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:12,682
I wanted to listen to
Ruirui's favorite song.

233
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:15,572
I'm just glad you're safe.

234
00:17:15,597 --> 00:17:19,628
We thought you couldn't take the pain
of your main leaving the band.

235
00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:23,530
I am hurt that he left the band.

236
00:17:24,368 --> 00:17:26,576
But it's the path he chose.

237
00:17:26,648 --> 00:17:28,313
So I'll always root for him.

238
00:17:29,218 --> 00:17:32,937
Because I think supporting
Ruirui's choices is also a stan's duty.

239
00:17:34,164 --> 00:17:36,603
Supporting his choices?

240
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,167
Without getting involved?

241
00:17:40,062 --> 00:17:41,264
Getting involved?

242
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:47,077
Of course not.
Because I'm a Ruirui stan.

243
00:17:48,247 --> 00:17:50,975
I just watch him from a distance.

244
00:17:52,507 --> 00:17:55,407
I won't even dare be in his presence.

245
00:17:57,485 --> 00:17:59,589
You really are an exemplary stan.

246
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:02,968
Let's do karaoke
and sing Color Di songs today.

247
00:18:03,023 --> 00:18:04,320
Let's cry together.

248
00:18:04,345 --> 00:18:06,667
Senior, thank you.

249
00:18:06,692 --> 00:18:08,597
Can I tag along?

250
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:09,919
I wanna go too.

251
00:18:09,944 --> 00:18:12,326
Sure, but don't sing songs
from other bands.

252
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:13,804
Jeez.

253
00:18:14,315 --> 00:18:16,177
Have you ever listened to this band?

254
00:18:24,862 --> 00:18:25,862
Then I'll...

255
00:18:27,979 --> 00:18:29,385
say goodbye here.

256
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,535
See you later, Senior.

257
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,900
I'll see you home.

258
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,537
Oh, you don't have to.

259
00:18:45,803 --> 00:18:50,768
I can't cause my main any more trouble.

260
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,989
You won't shut up.

261
00:18:53,346 --> 00:18:55,906
You might run into another creepy uncle.

262
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,699
Come on.

263
00:19:02,705 --> 00:19:03,705
Yes.

264
00:19:14,763 --> 00:19:18,047
Our relationship isn't one
between a main and his stan.

265
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,096
But...

266
00:19:27,813 --> 00:19:30,602
But when I listened to Emiri's story,

267
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,540
it completely matched my life.

268
00:19:39,983 --> 00:19:43,463
Let's just say that you and I are equal.

269
00:19:45,095 --> 00:19:46,598
Equal?

270
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:50,220
Yes, no one is higher
or lower than the other.

271
00:19:55,949 --> 00:19:57,306
I...

272
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,700
want to be next to you, Senior.

273
00:20:01,355 --> 00:20:04,832
And I want to know more about you.

274
00:20:06,983 --> 00:20:09,016
I can do that?

275
00:20:11,756 --> 00:20:13,176
Do as you please.

276
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:14,589
Eh?

277
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:15,717
But...

278
00:20:16,203 --> 00:20:17,838
stop sneaking around.

279
00:20:18,571 --> 00:20:19,771
Be candid.

280
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:23,255
Yes.

281
00:20:29,582 --> 00:20:30,618
So...

282
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,503
may I call you Senior Takara?

283
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:37,012
- No first name. It's a no go.
- Why not?

284
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,000
You said we were equal.

285
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,739
That was about something else.
It's not related.

286
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,716
So hard to understand.

287
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:52,825
So what is this I'm feeling?

288
00:20:58,113 --> 00:21:00,946
It's clearly love.

289
00:21:01,128 --> 00:21:03,552
Wow, your hair is so soft.

290
00:21:03,577 --> 00:21:06,000
- Like a dog's fur.
- Hey, wait a minute.

291
00:21:07,372 --> 00:21:08,549
What does this mean?

292
00:21:08,574 --> 00:21:11,658
Oh, we agreed to date each other.

293
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:13,203
- Right?
- Right?

294
00:21:13,486 --> 00:21:15,574
But what about Ruirui?

295
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:19,292
Tai-chan, a main is just a main.

296
00:21:19,494 --> 00:21:22,002
I don't want to date my main.

297
00:21:22,027 --> 00:21:25,300
And we'll continue to root for Ruirui.

298
00:21:25,573 --> 00:21:26,857
- Right?
- Right?

299
00:21:27,124 --> 00:21:29,411
Oh, I forgot, look at this.

300
00:21:32,365 --> 00:21:34,436
So...

301
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,420
liking a main...

302
00:21:38,405 --> 00:21:41,811
is what exactly?

303
00:21:43,486 --> 00:21:44,486
Tai-chan?

304
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:47,091
Hey, Tai-chan!

305
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,767
It probably caught Taishin off guard.

306
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,740
- He's in shock.
- Yeah.

307
00:23:13,193 --> 00:23:14,416
(Next episode)

308
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,549
It's so pretty.
It's like the sky's in there.

309
00:23:16,574 --> 00:23:18,424
I used to think that way.

310
00:23:18,449 --> 00:23:23,449
I wonder why you're not dating anyone.

311
00:23:23,474 --> 00:23:27,569
What exactly is this feeling?

312
00:23:28,362 --> 00:23:30,310
This is where I passed by.

313
00:23:30,864 --> 00:23:33,378
Why do you like marbles?

314
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,115
Because they're more beautiful
than the real thing.
