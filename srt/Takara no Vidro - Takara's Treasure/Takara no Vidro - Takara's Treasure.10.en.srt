1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:04,540
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

2
00:00:04,962 --> 00:00:06,357
Have you contacted them?

3
00:00:07,584 --> 00:00:10,697
I haven't got any details yet.

4
00:00:12,784 --> 00:00:16,331
Is my mom gonna be okay?

5
00:00:26,323 --> 00:00:27,476
I'll wait for you.

6
00:00:28,276 --> 00:00:29,415
Stay safe.

7
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:32,333
I will.

8
00:00:32,648 --> 00:00:34,077
Thank you.

9
00:00:34,418 --> 00:00:35,578
I'm gonna go.

10
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:51,697
"Takara's Treasure"
(Final Episode)

11
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:53,450
(Nakano)

12
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:55,254
Mom!

13
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,578
Taishin, you've come home?

14
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:02,711
Eh?

15
00:01:02,847 --> 00:01:07,229
My goodness, you should have told me
you were coming home..

16
00:01:09,184 --> 00:01:11,624
Are you okay?

17
00:01:12,474 --> 00:01:13,646
Oh, this?

18
00:01:14,334 --> 00:01:17,676
I just had a fall and broke my arm.

19
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,315
An ambulance was called. It was a mess.

20
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,643
Oh, my God.

21
00:01:24,213 --> 00:01:26,493
Did you come back
because you were worried?

22
00:01:27,335 --> 00:01:32,242
I thought it was something more serious.

23
00:01:32,267 --> 00:01:34,394
A broken arm is serious.

24
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,883
Chizuru?

25
00:01:35,907 --> 00:01:38,109
Did you summon Taishin?

26
00:01:38,134 --> 00:01:41,000
Well, he wouldn't come home.

27
00:01:41,025 --> 00:01:43,491
He wouldn't have returned
if nothing happened.

28
00:01:43,515 --> 00:01:45,595
We were all so lonely.

29
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,721
Whoa!

30
00:01:47,297 --> 00:01:50,510
Taishin. You finally came home.

31
00:01:50,535 --> 00:01:51,750
Dad?

32
00:01:51,775 --> 00:01:56,158
You wouldn't come home.
Chizuru was sulking.

33
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:57,579
Dad.

34
00:01:57,604 --> 00:02:00,202
- She was lonely.
- Yeah.

35
00:02:00,242 --> 00:02:02,660
Why do you keep talking nonsense?

36
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,140
- Hey!
- That hurts.

37
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:07,145
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- We were all lonely.

38
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,897
I'm glad your mom's okay.

39
00:02:11,925 --> 00:02:14,929
Yes. I'm relieved.

40
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,735
So when will you come back?

41
00:02:19,342 --> 00:02:23,972
I think I'll take the bus arriving
in Tokyo the night after tomorrow.

42
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,130
I'll just relax at home until then.

43
00:02:30,742 --> 00:02:31,742
Is that so?

44
00:02:37,221 --> 00:02:38,221
Senior?

45
00:02:39,715 --> 00:02:40,715
Hm?

46
00:02:42,173 --> 00:02:45,025
Are you playing with the marbles?

47
00:02:47,313 --> 00:02:48,732
How did you know?

48
00:02:51,192 --> 00:02:56,329
Well, you always play
with them after a shower.

49
00:03:00,606 --> 00:03:03,783
And you must be
lying down and rolling around.

50
00:03:04,178 --> 00:03:05,178
Eh?

51
00:03:07,429 --> 00:03:09,869
How did you know?

52
00:03:11,237 --> 00:03:13,837
You always go straight
to bed after a shower.

53
00:03:18,336 --> 00:03:19,439
Awesome.

54
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,610
You know me well.

55
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,226
It's so strange to me.

56
00:03:31,222 --> 00:03:32,222
Strange?

57
00:03:34,015 --> 00:03:38,370
Even though you sound so close,

58
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,319
right now...

59
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,000
you're physically so far away.

60
00:03:49,113 --> 00:03:51,600
Well, we're currently
in Tokyo and Kyushu.

61
00:03:53,551 --> 00:03:55,953
You're right...

62
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:03,117
It's like when I hear your voice...

63
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,133
I just...

64
00:04:09,137 --> 00:04:10,440
feel...

65
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,954
the urge to see you...

66
00:04:19,981 --> 00:04:21,014
Hey?

67
00:04:21,463 --> 00:04:22,506
Nakano?

68
00:04:28,757 --> 00:04:30,716
He fell asleep on me.

69
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:48,183
- I'm gonna pay Daisuke a visit.
- Okay.

70
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,773
Wait, wanna give him this radish?

71
00:04:51,205 --> 00:04:52,996
- Nah.
- Mm.

72
00:04:54,203 --> 00:04:55,403
Oh.

73
00:04:56,052 --> 00:04:57,632
Ow, ow, ow.

74
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:03,918
Huh?

75
00:05:04,406 --> 00:05:06,351
(Senior Takara)
Taishin's phone.

76
00:05:06,376 --> 00:05:07,492
Taishin!

77
00:05:07,716 --> 00:05:09,185
Taishin! Eh?

78
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:11,604
I accidentally answered.

79
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:12,629
Hello?

80
00:05:13,127 --> 00:05:14,127
Nakano?

81
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,500
Uh, I'm sorry.

82
00:05:16,612 --> 00:05:18,058
I accidentally answered.

83
00:05:18,226 --> 00:05:19,226
Eh?

84
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:22,659
Uh, I'm Taishin's mother.

85
00:05:23,434 --> 00:05:24,511
Oh.

86
00:05:25,503 --> 00:05:26,870
Nice to speak to you.

87
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:30,314
We study at the same university.

88
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:32,226
Oh, you're Senior Takara.

89
00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:34,309
Eh?

90
00:05:35,581 --> 00:05:36,438
I am.

91
00:05:36,623 --> 00:05:38,435
He told me about you.

92
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,506
Thanks for taking care of him.

93
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:43,445
I'm the one who should thank you.

94
00:05:44,147 --> 00:05:48,320
Taishin's gone to see Daisuke-kun,
his childhood friend.

95
00:05:49,127 --> 00:05:50,127
I see.

96
00:05:50,597 --> 00:05:51,892
I'll call again later.

97
00:05:53,642 --> 00:05:54,887
Oh, hold on.

98
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:01,792
Actually, I want to thank you.

99
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,330
Thank me?

100
00:06:03,355 --> 00:06:04,428
Mm.

101
00:06:04,983 --> 00:06:08,836
When Okame-kun died,
Taishin couldn't accept it.

102
00:06:09,743 --> 00:06:13,852
Because he was like a family member
who'd been with us for a long time.

103
00:06:13,877 --> 00:06:15,730
Taishin was devastated.

104
00:06:19,207 --> 00:06:22,627
He stormed out and refused to come home.

105
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,600
When we talked about going out
to look for him, he came back.

106
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:29,807
I see.

107
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,867
That incident.

108
00:06:33,683 --> 00:06:36,826
Suddenly he said he was going to Tokyo.

109
00:06:38,105 --> 00:06:41,396
Even though I got lonely
when he abruptly left, I was glad.

110
00:06:42,078 --> 00:06:47,057
Because in the end, the happy-go-lucky
Taishin found his own path.

111
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:53,844
I think he changed after meeting you.

112
00:06:56,386 --> 00:06:59,111
Anyway, please stay close to him.

113
00:07:01,364 --> 00:07:02,364
I will.

114
00:07:04,241 --> 00:07:06,749
By the way, next time come visit us.

115
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,960
Eh?

116
00:07:15,407 --> 00:07:16,407
I will.

117
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,763
I forgot my phone!

118
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:22,978
Oh, Mom, what are you doing?

119
00:07:23,753 --> 00:07:26,703
Taishin, I'm sorry.
Senior Takara called.

120
00:07:26,728 --> 00:07:29,532
Senior Takara called? Why?

121
00:07:29,707 --> 00:07:31,427
I accidentally answered.

122
00:07:31,474 --> 00:07:34,429
What were you thinking?

123
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:37,325
Senior, I'm sorry.

124
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,480
Will he eat our radishes?

125
00:07:39,505 --> 00:07:41,335
Don't suggest radishes.

126
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,230
Mom.

127
00:08:38,453 --> 00:08:42,026
(I've returned to Tokyo.)

128
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:57,210
(Can I come by right now?)

129
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:04,594
Going there this late,
I would be bothering him.

130
00:09:27,841 --> 00:09:28,841
Eh?

131
00:09:35,532 --> 00:09:36,764
Was that...

132
00:09:37,725 --> 00:09:40,648
The bell rang, right?

133
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:47,045
At this hour?

134
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:55,409
Don't tell me it's happening again.

135
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,964
W-w-w-weapon.

136
00:10:00,762 --> 00:10:01,908
Weapon.

137
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:25,932
Who...

138
00:10:26,563 --> 00:10:27,895
Who's there?

139
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:33,836
It's me.

140
00:10:50,766 --> 00:10:52,155
Why are you holding a pan?

141
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,940
It's...

142
00:10:54,665 --> 00:10:57,565
It's you. Why...

143
00:11:00,835 --> 00:11:02,776
Eh? Wait a sec.

144
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,679
Last night...

145
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,792
you said you wanted to see me.

146
00:11:19,606 --> 00:11:20,629
I did.

147
00:11:21,696 --> 00:11:22,696
Eh?

148
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:25,698
So you came to see me?

149
00:11:29,107 --> 00:11:30,123
Yes.

150
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,390
At the time...

151
00:11:39,108 --> 00:11:40,108
Hm?

152
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,892
When we first met on campus.

153
00:11:47,677 --> 00:11:51,847
I'm sorry I talked to you that way.

154
00:11:54,001 --> 00:11:55,001
Oh.

155
00:11:55,782 --> 00:12:00,782
But what you said was true.

156
00:12:06,928 --> 00:12:08,928
I didn't know missing someone...

157
00:12:11,555 --> 00:12:13,880
would feel like this.

158
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,711
I never thought that I'd...

159
00:12:23,789 --> 00:12:25,860
just show up here to see you.

160
00:12:42,802 --> 00:12:45,986
I missed you too.

161
00:12:58,032 --> 00:12:59,776
Sorry for coming at this hour.

162
00:13:01,584 --> 00:13:02,584
Don't.

163
00:13:04,385 --> 00:13:10,984
Because I was thinking about asking
if I could come by as well.

164
00:13:14,612 --> 00:13:16,414
Why didn't you ask?

165
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,058
I was worried...

166
00:13:21,853 --> 00:13:24,653
you might find me annoying.

167
00:13:30,222 --> 00:13:31,308
Oh!

168
00:13:37,871 --> 00:13:39,678
You're just so...

169
00:13:44,487 --> 00:13:45,487
Senior,

170
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,437
what's wrong?

171
00:13:57,563 --> 00:13:59,563
When you weren't at my place,

172
00:14:01,547 --> 00:14:03,260
I got anxious for some reason.

173
00:14:07,275 --> 00:14:08,925
You were?

174
00:14:17,577 --> 00:14:19,934
I wish you'd stay at my place forever.

175
00:14:25,378 --> 00:14:26,378
Eh?

176
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:33,734
I missed those things.

177
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,178
I'm so afraid of myself.

178
00:14:41,482 --> 00:14:42,760
Afraid?

179
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:54,646
You said I was nothing like my mom.

180
00:14:58,542 --> 00:15:00,542
But I may accidentally...

181
00:15:05,746 --> 00:15:08,896
do bad things to you too.

182
00:15:11,073 --> 00:15:13,639
In the end,
I won't be able to protect you.

183
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,588
Plus I showed up like this.

184
00:15:19,432 --> 00:15:21,190
I'm more annoying than you.

185
00:15:40,218 --> 00:15:43,181
Why on earth are you crying?

186
00:16:03,869 --> 00:16:06,244
Because you...

187
00:16:10,556 --> 00:16:12,414
are not annoying at all.

188
00:16:22,218 --> 00:16:23,750
And you...

189
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:29,387
really care about me.

190
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,445
So I'm happy.

191
00:16:48,822 --> 00:16:50,114
But Senior,

192
00:17:03,141 --> 00:17:04,141
I...

193
00:17:06,311 --> 00:17:11,798
I don't want you
to be afraid of yourself.

194
00:17:15,317 --> 00:17:16,787
And I...

195
00:17:19,075 --> 00:17:20,826
already told you...

196
00:17:23,637 --> 00:17:26,464
that if I didn't like something,
I'd let you know.

197
00:17:30,499 --> 00:17:37,424
And so far you haven't done
anything I don't like.

198
00:17:45,802 --> 00:17:50,317
Is that enough to ease your mind?

199
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,287
Senior Takara,

200
00:18:06,744 --> 00:18:08,228
I like you the most.

201
00:18:11,361 --> 00:18:13,713
I want to keep seeing you.

202
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:22,972
So I want you to tell me everything
you're thinking like you just did.

203
00:18:31,053 --> 00:18:32,053
Eh?

204
00:18:33,994 --> 00:18:34,994
It's just...

205
00:18:36,255 --> 00:18:39,235
you really are amazing.

206
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:41,640
Amazing?

207
00:18:44,629 --> 00:18:46,543
Suddenly flirting with me.

208
00:19:10,088 --> 00:19:11,088
Thanks,

209
00:19:14,457 --> 00:19:15,457
Taishin.

210
00:19:22,526 --> 00:19:23,526
Yes.

211
00:19:36,986 --> 00:19:41,704
I was completely shocked
my mom just started talking to you.

212
00:19:42,271 --> 00:19:43,271
Me too.

213
00:19:44,053 --> 00:19:48,093
Then my mom kept saying
how good of a person you were.

214
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:51,389
She invited me to visit your home.

215
00:19:52,408 --> 00:19:53,408
Eh?

216
00:19:53,846 --> 00:19:55,853
That was so rude.

217
00:19:57,261 --> 00:19:58,267
Nah.

218
00:19:58,775 --> 00:20:00,894
I think she's just like you.

219
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,507
Really?

220
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,080
Mm.

221
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,740
He grew up in a good family.

222
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,188
So who is Daisuke?

223
00:20:18,421 --> 00:20:19,421
Eh?

224
00:20:19,446 --> 00:20:23,886
Oh, my childhood friend. We studied
together until we graduated high school.

225
00:20:24,783 --> 00:20:25,783
Yeah?

226
00:20:27,045 --> 00:20:28,045
Eh?

227
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:31,129
Don't tell me you're jealous.

228
00:20:31,508 --> 00:20:33,225
That Senior Takara?

229
00:20:34,177 --> 00:20:35,187
Shut up.

230
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:36,777
Eh?

231
00:20:40,412 --> 00:20:44,032
I guess this is what it's like.

232
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,080
Eh?

233
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:50,919
As expected,

234
00:20:51,305 --> 00:20:53,032
I'm a possessive bastard.

235
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,452
Plus I'm jealous
of your childhood friend.

236
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,790
I couldn't stand missing you
and just showed up here.

237
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,709
It was a ridiculous thing to do.

238
00:21:08,564 --> 00:21:09,564
But...

239
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,543
it's not all bad.

240
00:21:25,364 --> 00:21:29,948
I had fun visiting you yesterday.

241
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,412
It's wonderful to see someone we like.

242
00:21:55,493 --> 00:21:56,832
Senior Takara,

243
00:22:01,024 --> 00:22:02,270
right now...

244
00:22:04,765 --> 00:22:06,653
what level am I at?

245
00:22:08,348 --> 00:22:09,851
Out of hundred percent.

246
00:22:14,771 --> 00:22:15,967
Have I...

247
00:22:17,826 --> 00:22:22,714
become someone you like?

248
00:22:33,511 --> 00:22:35,381
You're so dumb.

249
00:22:52,729 --> 00:22:55,145
Ever since I met him,

250
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,901
every day of my life
has been incredibly sparkling.

251
00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:06,602
Like the marble I got that day.

252
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:13,119
(Takara's Treasure Spinoff)
I have a secret I haven't told anyone.

253
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,155
What are you doing?

254
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:15,764
You're loud. Shut up.

255
00:23:15,775 --> 00:23:18,441
I want you to speak your mind.

256
00:23:18,452 --> 00:23:22,105
We were apart for just a short time.
People can be so greedy.

257
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:30,390
It all started when I witnessed
a shocking incident last year.

258
00:23:31,739 --> 00:23:34,459
I was so lonely when you were away.
