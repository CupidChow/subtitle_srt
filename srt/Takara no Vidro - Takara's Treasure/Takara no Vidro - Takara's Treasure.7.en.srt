1
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,451
What should I do?

2
00:01:05,694 --> 00:01:10,799
"Takara's Treasure"
(Episode 7)

3
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:13,823
Here.

4
00:01:15,884 --> 00:01:17,519
Thank you.

5
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:22,834
I'm sorry that I was out like a light.

6
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:24,039
You were.

7
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:28,346
Where did you sleep last night?

8
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,507
I slept in that area.

9
00:01:32,064 --> 00:01:37,566
Oh, I'm sorry I took your bed.

10
00:01:42,775 --> 00:01:45,522
Hm, the fever has gone down.

11
00:01:47,794 --> 00:01:49,001
Yes.

12
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:51,831
I'm better now.

13
00:01:53,576 --> 00:01:56,911
Don't be so nervous.
Where's your eagerness from yesterday?

14
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,883
Yesterday I acted very rude.

15
00:02:02,908 --> 00:02:05,111
I told you to forget it.

16
00:02:08,683 --> 00:02:10,602
Not only that...

17
00:02:19,158 --> 00:02:20,318
What else?

18
00:02:21,393 --> 00:02:25,702
Well, it's probably nothing.

19
00:02:26,712 --> 00:02:28,019
So...

20
00:02:28,812 --> 00:02:31,534
what I'm feeling...

21
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,129
What kind of affection is this?

22
00:02:39,613 --> 00:02:42,295
That must have been a dream.

23
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:45,198
It must have.

24
00:02:48,732 --> 00:02:50,956
That thing about you liking me?

25
00:02:52,814 --> 00:02:56,609
Wasn't I dreaming that?

26
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,180
You weren't?

27
00:03:03,921 --> 00:03:11,754
I'm sorry. My brain's so fuzzy
I can't quite connect the dots.

28
00:03:13,524 --> 00:03:15,128
It was a matter of...

29
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:16,385
Were you joking?

30
00:03:26,063 --> 00:03:27,121
Jo...

31
00:03:30,429 --> 00:03:31,429
king...

32
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:41,754
No.

33
00:03:44,743 --> 00:03:46,573
I wasn't...

34
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,487
really joking.

35
00:04:05,176 --> 00:04:06,558
I...

36
00:04:09,687 --> 00:04:11,418
like...

37
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,274
you, Senior.

38
00:04:24,087 --> 00:04:25,581
But...

39
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,368
you're probably annoyed by that.

40
00:04:29,432 --> 00:04:32,624
Just pretend that I was joking.

41
00:04:34,727 --> 00:04:36,438
I'm sorry...

42
00:04:38,297 --> 00:04:40,234
for saying such a weird thing.

43
00:04:49,616 --> 00:04:54,869
So I'm to pretend like I didn't hear
it and act like nothing's changed?

44
00:04:58,532 --> 00:04:59,746
Yes.

45
00:05:01,944 --> 00:05:04,452
But I'm not good at pretending.

46
00:05:07,444 --> 00:05:08,444
Eh?

47
00:05:10,054 --> 00:05:15,871
You will become the junior
I don't know how to handle.

48
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,350
I won't be able to tease you again.

49
00:05:34,473 --> 00:05:35,473
Come here.

50
00:06:11,107 --> 00:06:14,808
You've cried in front of me
too many times.

51
00:06:17,859 --> 00:06:19,296
I'm sorry.

52
00:06:22,953 --> 00:06:27,540
There's a scenario that won't make me
uncomfortable and won't make you cry.

53
00:06:34,354 --> 00:06:36,324
I can't think of anything.

54
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:40,080
I mean you can say it another way.

55
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:47,164
Say it another way?

56
00:06:52,422 --> 00:06:57,527
I want you to continue teasing me.

57
00:06:57,824 --> 00:06:58,824
Failed.

58
00:06:59,262 --> 00:07:00,262
Eh?

59
00:07:00,943 --> 00:07:04,240
There's a win-win scenario, isn't there?

60
00:07:17,872 --> 00:07:20,752
But that way...

61
00:07:23,018 --> 00:07:26,401
won't I be the only one who's happy?

62
00:07:28,151 --> 00:07:29,521
Try saying it.

63
00:07:32,632 --> 00:07:36,302
But I don't dare say that...

64
00:07:40,021 --> 00:07:43,697
"I like you. Please date me."

65
00:07:43,774 --> 00:07:45,189
There you've said it.

66
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,840
Oh?

67
00:07:58,989 --> 00:07:59,989
Eh?

68
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:02,633
It's possible.

69
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:06,791
Eh?

70
00:08:11,822 --> 00:08:14,040
Okay, I'll date you.

71
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,096
You'll date me?

72
00:08:27,566 --> 00:08:32,364
You're going to date me?

73
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,599
That's what I'm saying.

74
00:08:37,361 --> 00:08:42,268
You like me too?

75
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:45,693
I didn't say that.

76
00:08:47,122 --> 00:08:49,330
So why...

77
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:58,083
I planned to let it go
if you hadn't caught on.

78
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:03,133
But once you caught on,
you immediately backed off.

79
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,146
Eh?

80
00:09:07,989 --> 00:09:10,963
That upset and annoyed me.

81
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,967
Are you saying...

82
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:20,243
you were desperate?

83
00:09:22,054 --> 00:09:24,381
Who would kiss anyone
out of desperation?

84
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:27,484
Kiss...

85
00:09:32,469 --> 00:09:34,390
You really are slow.

86
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:45,639
Welcome. Oh, Takara, are you here alone?

87
00:09:45,664 --> 00:09:46,664
No.

88
00:09:47,724 --> 00:09:48,724
There's two of us.

89
00:09:48,735 --> 00:09:49,735
Okay.

90
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:53,964
You normally don't bring anyone with you.

91
00:09:54,764 --> 00:09:58,304
- I'll have the usual.
- All right. What about you, son?

92
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:01,262
Eh, uh, I'll have...

93
00:10:02,176 --> 00:10:05,596
- what he's having.
- Sure.

94
00:10:06,488 --> 00:10:07,812
Are you sure?

95
00:10:08,303 --> 00:10:09,303
Eh?

96
00:10:09,723 --> 00:10:12,723
It's the most delicious dish here,

97
00:10:12,748 --> 00:10:15,648
- but you should get the normal...
- No, I want the same.

98
00:10:16,765 --> 00:10:19,519
Here, satisfyingly spicy.

99
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:25,160
Bright red.

100
00:10:25,642 --> 00:10:28,124
That's why I told you
to order the normal version.

101
00:10:29,616 --> 00:10:31,127
Let's eat.

102
00:10:40,935 --> 00:10:42,158
I'll dig in.

103
00:10:44,054 --> 00:10:45,054
Let's eat.

104
00:10:57,387 --> 00:10:58,594
So spicy.

105
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:15,262
Don't force yourself. I'll eat it.

106
00:11:17,305 --> 00:11:19,376
- Want to order another bowl?
- No.

107
00:11:19,811 --> 00:11:22,511
It's spicy but it's delicious.

108
00:11:24,174 --> 00:11:25,174
Yeah?

109
00:11:26,401 --> 00:11:27,661
You're brave.

110
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:33,111
Are you a regular here?

111
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:36,829
I come here a lot.

112
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,609
That's right. You like ramen.

113
00:11:42,187 --> 00:11:43,187
And you?

114
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:45,579
Eh?

115
00:11:47,652 --> 00:11:49,162
What do you like?

116
00:11:50,907 --> 00:11:51,907
Uh...

117
00:11:54,913 --> 00:11:56,913
I like...

118
00:12:03,121 --> 00:12:06,784
Dumbass. Not that. I meant food.

119
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,913
Oh, food?

120
00:12:10,387 --> 00:12:12,387
Uh, I like...

121
00:12:14,215 --> 00:12:15,215
pudding.

122
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,370
Pudding?

123
00:12:22,532 --> 00:12:23,982
Will I be able to eat it?

124
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:42,915
A dream, a hallucination, a fantasy.

125
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:46,257
It wasn't any of the three.

126
00:12:48,822 --> 00:12:54,256
Because my mouth still burns.

127
00:12:55,987 --> 00:12:59,737
These clothes are also too baggy.

128
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:06,690
And Senior Takara is really here.

129
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,824
What's wrong?

130
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:24,292
Are you really real?

131
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,200
Huh?

132
00:13:29,898 --> 00:13:31,507
This isn't...

133
00:13:33,478 --> 00:13:36,402
really a dream, right?

134
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:43,858
Are we really dating?

135
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:48,833
Ow.

136
00:13:49,557 --> 00:13:51,015
Understand now?

137
00:13:51,785 --> 00:13:53,288
It's not a dream, right?

138
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,150
No.

139
00:13:57,902 --> 00:14:00,040
- Go sit over there.
- Eh?

140
00:14:17,292 --> 00:14:21,104
So this is not a dream.

141
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,326
That guy just now looks so cool.

142
00:14:26,351 --> 00:14:28,726
I thought he was a model
because he's tall.

143
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,107
- I wish he was my boyfriend.
- I wouldn't dare stand next to him.

144
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:36,589
Stand next to him?

145
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:41,008
Here.

146
00:14:41,112 --> 00:14:42,112
Oh.

147
00:14:45,595 --> 00:14:46,595
This is...

148
00:14:47,917 --> 00:14:50,759
Strawberry pudding flavor,
limited time offer.

149
00:14:51,843 --> 00:14:53,243
Cleanse your palate.

150
00:14:55,425 --> 00:14:56,910
Thank you.

151
00:14:58,034 --> 00:15:00,903
Oh, where's yours?

152
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:03,142
It's too sweet for me.

153
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,793
I'm gonna drink it.

154
00:15:16,597 --> 00:15:18,183
It's delicious.

155
00:15:18,974 --> 00:15:20,978
Must be super sweet.

156
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,321
Oh, would you like some?

157
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:26,293
No, I'd rather not.

158
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,490
"Today...

159
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:45,440
Thank you very much.

160
00:15:46,595 --> 00:15:49,037
Both the ramen

161
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:56,985
and the strawberry pudding were delicious.

162
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:04,719
I'd like you

163
00:16:04,743 --> 00:16:11,300
to recommend me more things."

164
00:16:18,796 --> 00:16:20,104
(Senior Takara)

165
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:21,129
Eh?

166
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:32,965
Hello?

167
00:16:34,418 --> 00:16:35,434
Hey.

168
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,694
Is there something wrong?

169
00:16:38,473 --> 00:16:41,000
No, I'm too lazy to type.

170
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:44,996
Eh? So you called me?

171
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,776
Is it wrong?

172
00:16:47,437 --> 00:16:49,243
Not at all. Uh...

173
00:16:51,403 --> 00:16:53,640
I'm actually happy.

174
00:16:57,542 --> 00:16:58,542
Uh...

175
00:16:59,924 --> 00:17:04,538
I'd like you to
recommend me more things.

176
00:17:06,308 --> 00:17:08,942
What do you want me to recommend?

177
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,970
It can be anything.

178
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:16,958
I'll do mountains.

179
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:22,533
Senior, you really like mountains.

180
00:17:23,724 --> 00:17:24,832
Well.

181
00:17:26,157 --> 00:17:28,498
When did you start liking them?

182
00:17:29,574 --> 00:17:30,708
When?

183
00:17:34,193 --> 00:17:36,790
Probably after my grandpa
took me to one.

184
00:17:48,305 --> 00:17:51,140
Well? Isn't it cool here?

185
00:17:52,165 --> 00:17:54,140
Is this your "beauty"?

186
00:17:54,212 --> 00:17:55,540
That's right.

187
00:17:57,512 --> 00:18:01,212
When I come here, I feel relaxed.

188
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:02,901
Really?

189
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:11,504
I understand it's beautiful
but it feels strange.

190
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,130
Strange?

191
00:18:17,676 --> 00:18:19,300
The sound of the river.

192
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,607
The sound of rustling trees.

193
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:26,077
There are a lot of sounds
but it's peaceful.

194
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,940
It's like...

195
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,194
Mm...

196
00:18:34,193 --> 00:18:36,026
I don't know how to say it.

197
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,400
Is that so? You like it.

198
00:18:41,562 --> 00:18:43,951
You're just like me.

199
00:18:44,701 --> 00:18:46,390
You like mountains?

200
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:51,925
That's right.
There's a mountain I'd like to climb.

201
00:18:52,394 --> 00:18:53,986
What mountain?

202
00:18:54,552 --> 00:18:57,000
It's called the Matterhorn.

203
00:18:58,191 --> 00:19:00,220
I'd love to see it too.

204
00:19:05,532 --> 00:19:08,712
Have you been to the Matterhorn?

205
00:19:10,953 --> 00:19:13,062
No, not yet.

206
00:19:14,656 --> 00:19:16,764
I hope you make it there someday.

207
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:21,166
I do too.

208
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,787
What's funny?

209
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:29,134
Nothing.

210
00:19:32,768 --> 00:19:34,836
I've learned something about you.

211
00:19:36,857 --> 00:19:38,313
So I'm happy.

212
00:19:40,256 --> 00:19:41,256
Yeah?

213
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,383
It's late. Go to bed.

214
00:19:46,805 --> 00:19:47,805
Uh...

215
00:19:48,876 --> 00:19:49,876
Yes.

216
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,900
See you tomorrow on campus.

217
00:19:57,512 --> 00:20:00,055
Mm. Good night.

218
00:20:02,771 --> 00:20:04,287
Good night.

219
00:20:21,266 --> 00:20:22,590
That's right.

220
00:20:23,113 --> 00:20:26,234
But yours is wonderful too.

221
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:29,450
Hey, Takara, say hello.

222
00:20:29,474 --> 00:20:32,040
Wow, is this Takara-kun?

223
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:34,319
Cute as a doll.

224
00:20:34,344 --> 00:20:38,264
Isn't he? Fortunately,
he doesn't look like his father.

225
00:20:40,362 --> 00:20:43,210
But you're beautiful, Momoka-san.

226
00:20:43,262 --> 00:20:44,866
Well, you're too kind.

227
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:49,048
You're really are adorable.

228
00:20:52,765 --> 00:20:57,695
That ring is so beautiful.
I wish I had one.

229
00:21:00,304 --> 00:21:02,584
You already have a lot.

230
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:05,870
No, they're not enough.

231
00:21:06,456 --> 00:21:10,800
If I want something,
I'll find a way to have it.

232
00:21:27,727 --> 00:21:30,014
Oh, Senior Takara.

233
00:21:30,565 --> 00:21:34,780
- Whoa, I haven't seen Senior Takara in ages.
- Go talk to him.

234
00:21:34,805 --> 00:21:38,675
No, I can't. I don't dare.

235
00:21:45,092 --> 00:21:47,794
Hey, have you watched
Ruirui's live stream?

236
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:50,097
He was so handsome I was shocked.

237
00:21:50,121 --> 00:21:52,410
I have. I took a lot of screenshots.

238
00:21:52,695 --> 00:21:55,391
- Right?
- What are they talking about?

239
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:58,123
But they look happy.
They suit each other.

240
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,075
- So cool, right?
- So cool.

241
00:22:00,465 --> 00:22:01,465
Hey,

242
00:22:02,282 --> 00:22:06,512
- what does "suit each other" mean?
- Eh?

243
00:22:06,537 --> 00:22:07,792
Hm...

244
00:22:07,803 --> 00:22:10,887
Like they have similar personalities.
Their vibes are compatible.

245
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,248
You're right.

246
00:22:12,378 --> 00:22:15,368
Like being next to the other person
and not feeling alienated.

247
00:22:15,378 --> 00:22:16,378
Mm.

248
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:28,814
Oh.

249
00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:34,111
- Were you waiting for me?
- Mm.

250
00:22:34,892 --> 00:22:37,090
Let's walk to
the train station together.

251
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:38,873
Sure.

252
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,817
Senior Takara is within arm's reach.

253
00:22:51,431 --> 00:22:52,895
I'm so happy.

254
00:22:53,824 --> 00:22:55,925
I am happy...

255
00:23:01,195 --> 00:23:05,475
but maybe he and I...

256
00:23:06,338 --> 00:23:09,338
don't suit each other.

257
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,690
(Next episode)
Is this a date?

258
00:23:14,816 --> 00:23:15,883
Let's go.

259
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:19,730
Does dating mean you must be fully
into each other from the beginning?

260
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:24,370
Can I try until you're fully into me?

261
00:23:28,335 --> 00:23:30,737
- What is this?
- Are you going with your grandpa?

262
00:23:30,762 --> 00:23:31,880
I don't know yet.

263
00:23:31,905 --> 00:23:36,263
Or maybe he and I
don't suit each other at all.
