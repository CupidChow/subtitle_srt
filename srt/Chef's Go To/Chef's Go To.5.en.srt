SCENES OF ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION

00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:11,211
<i>-Thank you so much.</i>
<i>-Thanks.</i>

5
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:12,579
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:15,048
THE FOODIES FINISH EATING
PORK <i>GOPCHANG </i>HOT POT

7
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,618
-Where do we go next?
-Let's go for round two.

8
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,052
-OK.
-This neighborhood's nice.

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,022
There's a nice corner store nearby.

10
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:23,090
-Really?
-Yes.

11
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:25,859
-Are we having ice cream for round two?
-Yes.

12
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:27,194
-Really?
-Yes.

13
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:29,263
But I need more alcohol.

14
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:30,597
CRAVING MORE ALCOHOL

15
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:33,433
This store will meet your needs.

16
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,768
-Is that so?
-Yes.

17
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:36,537
-Do they have everything?
-Yes.

18
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:38,205
HEADING TO THE STORE

19
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:43,977
What I realized in this town is
that the signs are all old-fashioned.

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,451
THE ALLEY IS LINED WITH OLD SIGNS

21
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,521
JEONNONG-DONG IS AN OLD, SMALL TOWN

22
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:55,856
COMPUTERIZED LAUNDRY

23
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:57,724
Remember this when we were little?

24
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,493
They didn't say computerized laundry,

25
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,762
-but computer instead.
-Exactly.

26
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,630
Why did they add "computer" to signs?

27
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:05,766
-Maybe because they used machines?
-Maybe.

28
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,601
The office is named after the realtor.

29
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:09,570
It says Gyeongjin Real Estate.

30
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:12,506
I don't like the name of this office.

31
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:13,740
But it feels friendly.

32
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,376
"Used Electronics Store."

33
00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:18,278
This place is amazing.

34
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:20,948
It says "Uiseong Electronics,
Used Electronics Store."

35
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:23,417
Preserving old signs is considered cool.

36
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:24,952
Absolutely. I agree.

37
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,920
It's not vintage. It's just stylish.

38
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:30,357
-You can't make signs like this anymore.
-Right.

39
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:31,758
This looks nice, Taehoon.

40
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:33,293
-It sure is.
-This lamp.

41
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:37,297
THIS ICONIC LAMP
GIVES OFF JEONNONG-DONG VIBES

42
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:39,933
I'll gift you this
when you open your restaurant, Namno.

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,034
-This one?
-Yes.

44
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,170
-Buy me one right now.
-For his new house?

45
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:45,706
-I want it now. I don't have a lamp.
-Let's hurry.

46
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,275
It might use a lot of power
since it's an old one.

47
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:56,950
THROUGH AN OLD WINDING ALLEY

48
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,157
SLOW DOWN AND YOU'LL GET THERE

49
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:07,294
-Hold on.
-Where is it?

50
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:09,029
-Is that it with the sign--
-See?

51
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:10,430
-Is it this one?
-No.

52
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:13,100
Is it the Busan Store
with "cigarette" on the sign?

53
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,768
-Where?
-There.

54
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:17,838
-The faded red sign.
-It blends in with the neighborhood.

55
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:19,940
A STORE THAT FITS WELL
WITH THE NEIGHBORHOOD

56
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:22,442
-It's a corner store.
-They even have a waiting area.

57
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,877
-Really?
-Yes.

58
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:26,013
-Stop lying. Hold on.
-Where is it?

59
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,181
Look here.

60
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,615
-What's that?
-Look at that.

61
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,953
-Do you have to wait to buy things?
-Do that many people come to shop here?

62
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,122
-It has one.
-You have to wait.

63
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:36,190
-Really?
-Yes.

64
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:39,493
Why would you wait in a hair salon?

65
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,695
Let's go inside.

66
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:44,164
It's cool that they didn't renew the sign.

67
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:47,267
-Wait.
-The hair salon remains just as it was.

68
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,770
Now I get it.

69
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,305
WAITING AREA LOOKS LIKE A SALON

70
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,106
Is this a store?

71
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,276
I think I get it.
You shop in the store and drink beer here.

72
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,579
-Let's go in first.
-This is awesome.

73
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,147
-Right?
-It has many hidden spots.

74
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:01,849
-Really?
-This is so cool.

75
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:05,452
-Are we eating here then?
-Let's head inside first.

76
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,222
Just tell us already. I'm dying to know.

77
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,159
TIME TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH

78
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:14,862
BUSAN STORE

79
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,800
-There's a kitchen.
-Hello, Auntie.

80
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,502
-Hello.
-Hi.

81
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:22,636
There's a kitchen?

82
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,639
-Come on in.
-This is the place for round two.

83
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,575
-Nice to meet you.
-It's an honor.

84
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:30,844
-This is a restaurant?
-It's a corner store.

85
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:33,847
-It used to be one. Now it's a diner.
-This is incredible.

86
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:34,948
-Come in.
-Let's go.

87
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:37,217
-Watch your head.
-Let's take a look.

88
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:39,620
This is super cool.

89
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,321
THE STORE GIVES OFF A RETRO FEEL

90
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,489
What is all this?

91
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:46,793
-A beer diner?
-It's a small store that sells beer.

92
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,395
<i>In the old days, people drank</i>

93
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:50,430
<i>-in front of corner stores.</i>
<i>-That's right.</i>

94
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,833
<i>They would sit and have fun</i>
<i>on the low wooden bench…</i>

95
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,401
<i>-Right.</i>
<i>-…in the daytime.</i>

96
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:56,637
<i>And then drink beer</i>
<i>or </i>makgeolli <i>in the evening.</i>

97
00:03:58,005 --> 00:04:00,774
Wait, why is it called Busan Store?

98
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:05,479
I asked if it was because the owner was
from Busan, but that's not it.

99
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:08,282
-The first owner was from Busan.
-I see.

100
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:11,785
The new owner took over
and kept the store's original name.

101
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:12,986
<i>They didn't change it.</i>

102
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,556
<i>-It's been here for about 30 years.</i>
<i>-That's a long time.</i>

103
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,791
TODAY'S GO-TO SPOT HAS
STOOD HERE FOR 30 YEARS

104
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,660
There are so many dishes.

105
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:20,861
-I know.
-It's amazing.

106
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,764
-It's like a snack bar.
-Exactly.

107
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,668
-They even have <i>gopchang </i>hot pot.
-It's on the menu!

108
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,404
I want dried monkfish.

109
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:33,340
CHICKEN SOUP, <i>YUKHOE,</i>
PORK BELLY, <i>GOPCHANG </i>HOT POT

110
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,609
THIS SPOT IS LIKE A PROPER RESTAURANT

111
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,544
-When I come here--
-He's our guide.

112
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:41,048
-I'll write it down for you.
-I have some dishes I want you to try.

113
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,516
-The first is <i>gimbap</i>.
-Okay.

114
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,053
<i>Tteokbokki </i>is a must with <i>gimbap.</i>

115
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,021
-Of course, we're having soju.
-Really?

116
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,923
Wait, <i>gimbap </i>with soju?

117
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,192
I recommend the spicy chili <i>gimbap </i>here.

118
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,294
-Is that good?
-The spicy chili <i>gimbap.</i>

119
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:56,129
-The SCG.
-Right.

120
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:02,703
SPREAD RICE EVENLY
ON TOP OF THE DRIED SEAWEED

121
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:07,207
PLACE DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS ON TOP

122
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:11,411
ADD LOTS OF CHOPPED CHILI PEPPERS

123
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:16,016
ROLL IT TIGHTLY BUT GENTLY
SO AS NOT TO BURST IT

124
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:20,053
SLICE IT INTO BITE-SIZED PIECES

125
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:23,924
MOUTH-WATERING SPICY CHILI <i>GIMBAP </i>IS READY

126
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,759
<i>-What else?</i>
<i>-What else should we order?</i>

127
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:27,594
-Pork cutlet.
-Pork cutlet?

128
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,363
Pork cutlet at a corner store.

129
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,331
-You will be surprised.
-The large one?

130
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:33,100
The large one costs 10,000 won.

131
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,268
Let's check its size.

132
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,904
-Of course.
-Is it a good value for money?

133
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,412
POUND THE PORK EVENLY

134
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,049
COAT IT WITH BREADCRUMBS
AFTER DIPPING IT IN EGG WASH

135
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:55,556
DROP IT IN PRE-HEATED OIL

136
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,926
AFTER DEEP-FRYING WITH A DELICIOUS SIZZLE

137
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,564
THE OLD-SCHOOL PORK CUTLET IS READY

138
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,500
Next up is <i>yukhoe.</i>

139
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:07,701
<i>-Yukhoe?</i>
-Yes.

140
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,236
It's called "fresh <i>yukhoe."</i>

141
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:14,975
When the owners receive an order,
they go buy fresh beef for that day,

142
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,511
-and make the <i>yukhoe </i>fresh.
-That's how it was named.

143
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:18,712
FRESHLY-MADE <i>YUKHOE</i>

144
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,914
We will try these three dishes today.

145
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:22,850
There's no cash register here, either.

146
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,586
-We write it here.
-It's handwritten.

147
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:29,590
Yes, people order while drinking alcohol.
The customers write it themselves.

148
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:33,093
Is it for their conscience?
It's like investigating a crime scene.

149
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:36,964
You can double-check the order
with their handwriting.

150
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,366
"Hey, Self-Made Chef!
Isn't this your handwriting?"

151
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:40,767
Is that how it goes?

152
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:41,902
-I'm sorry.
-No worries.

153
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:45,539
Chef Taehoon wrote it,
so he will take full responsibility.

154
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:46,740
I see.

155
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,876
I'll take full responsibility

156
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,944
-if you dine and dash.
-All right.

157
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,412
Auntie.

158
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,549
-What would you like to order?
-One spicy chili <i>gimbap.</i>

159
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:57,718
-Okay.
-Then, pork cutlet and fresh <i>yukhoe.</i>

160
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,620
-Those are our best dishes.
-Is that so?

161
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,723
-Will you be buying the beef right away?
-Yes, at the butcher's.

162
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,259
-Do you buy it and make it yourself?
-Of course.

163
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:08,061
-You can't order it after 8:00 p.m.
-Really?

164
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:10,430
-It's when the butcher closes.
-They're closed.

165
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:13,300
She might get mad at the customer.
"Why'd you come so late?"

166
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:15,068
-"Come early for <i>yukhoe."</i>
-"Early."

167
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:16,937
-"You should've come yesterday."
-Right.

168
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:19,907
-Do we write our order for drinks here?
-Will you have soju?

169
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:21,108
-No.
-I'll have soju.

170
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:22,576
-Just take it out.
-Really?

171
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:23,944
-Yes.
-All right.

172
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:25,345
-Here you go.
-Zero sugar?

173
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:26,413
-Yes.
-You drink zero?

174
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,481
-Is this okay?
-Yes.

175
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:29,583
-Should I place them here?
-Side dishes?

176
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:35,055
-These are all my favorites.
-I made them myself.

177
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,324
Radish and green onion kimchi,
and garlic stems.

178
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:39,526
-This store is a proper restaurant.
-Right.

179
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:45,032
<i>There are green onion kimchi, young</i>
<i>radish kimchi, garlic stems, and peanuts.</i>

180
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,501
<i>-Seasoned laver flakes.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

181
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:49,837
<i>It's amazing that she makes</i>
<i>all these herself.</i>

182
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,605
-Enjoy.
-Look here.

183
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:53,140
There's a slush soju fridge.

184
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:56,643
-Is there something else?
-You can take it out yourself.

185
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,045
THE SIGNATURE SLUSH SOJU

186
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:05,052
SHAKING

187
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:13,493
ALCOHOL IS A MUST ON CHEF'S GO-TO

188
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:16,496
-Let's have a good time.
-Cheers.

189
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:17,664
LET'S GO

190
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:21,268
A GLASS OF SOJU HERE AND THERE

191
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:26,907
FIRST DISH, <i>GIMBAP</i>

192
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:29,510
-Here's the spicy chili <i>gimbap.</i>
-The <i>gimbap </i>is here.

193
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,712
It's like homemade <i>gimbap.</i>

194
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:33,547
Just like the ones our moms made.

195
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:35,782
-Those have a strong sesame oil aroma.
-Exactly.

196
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,017
-Let's eat.
-It's simple.

197
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:38,218
-With sesame seeds.
-Yes.

198
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:41,255
SIMPLE BUT MADE WITH LOVE

199
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:44,291
-I can see the Cheongyang peppers.
-It's like homemade <i>gimbap.</i>

200
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:45,759
-It's simple.
-Like my mom's.

201
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:47,094
TAKING A BITE

202
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:50,631
It's delicious.

203
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,232
NODDING AT HOW TASTY IT IS

204
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:54,067
-Great.
-It's fantastic.

205
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:58,205
-It has a nice, spicy finish.
-Cheongyang peppers.

206
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:03,443
-Just a little bit.
-I get why you'd drink soju with <i>gimbap.</i>

207
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:10,751
AN ADDICTIVE PAIRING OF <i>GIMBAP </i>AND SOJU

208
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:12,186
While eating this…

209
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,454
-Remind you of something?
-Yes.

210
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:16,390
-Since it's a bit spicy…
-Right.

211
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,792
…try it with seasoned laver flakes.

212
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,962
-Laver flakes on <i>gimbap.</i>
-This is the stuff.

213
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:24,198
Man, it's so yummy.

214
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,599
-It's nice and sweet.
-Yes.

215
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,000
JUST PERFECT

216
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:31,905
IT BALANCES OUT THE SPICINESS

217
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:36,844
<i>It's moist, crunchy,</i>
<i>and well-coated with seasoning.</i>

218
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:40,113
-This sure is homemade <i>gimbap.</i>
-Absolutely.

219
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:41,915
-Isn't it good?
-Yes.

220
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,183
AGREES RIGHT AWAY

221
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,219
I usually hate moist seaweed flakes.

222
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:48,922
-Me too.
-But it's good because it's moist.

223
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:50,557
Umami enhances the sweetness.

224
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:52,960
Let's play rock, paper, scissors
for this last bite.

225
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,194
-All right.
-Okay.

226
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,163
-I'll just eat it.
-No way.

227
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,364
Absolutely not.

228
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,032
-Does the winner get it?
-Yes.

229
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,467
Rock, paper, scissors!

230
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:03,370
Rock, paper, scissors.

231
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,339
I'll eat it.

232
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:08,509
-He's eating the end pieces.
-There's joy in them.

233
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,944
The end pieces have more filling.

234
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:14,147
THE END PIECES ARE THE HIGHLIGHT OF <i>GIMBAP</i>

235
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:15,983
The ingredients are longer.

236
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:20,087
If the pickled radish is bigger
in the end pieces, you taste it more.

237
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:23,156
-What kind of <i>gimbap </i>do you like?
-For me…

238
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:25,559
-Everyone has a preference.
-Right.

239
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:28,695
These days, I have enough money
to get beef <i>gimbap.</i>

240
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:30,030
-Impressive.
-He has money.

241
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:32,266
-The most expensive one.
-He makes good money.

242
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,434
Tuna <i>gimbap </i>was the best I could afford.

243
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:36,937
Namno is picking up the tab today anyway.

244
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:38,605
-Oh, right.
-If you want more--

245
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:40,240
-I'm paying for this, too?
-Yes.

246
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,475
You're paying for all.

247
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:43,510
-You lost, so you're paying.
-All day.

248
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:45,112
-For the whole day?
-Yes.

249
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:48,182
That's what we agreed on.

250
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:49,850
I'm reporting you to the police.

251
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,690
THE SECOND DISH ARRIVES
WHILE THEY ARE CHATTING

252
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:00,627
-Oh, it's a big pork cutlet.
-This is amazing.

253
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:02,896
-Hold on.
-What?

254
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:05,699
This isn't just a simple dish
drizzled with sauce.

255
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,701
LARGE PORK CUTLET

256
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:12,706
NOT A PLAIN PORK CUTLET,
BUT A KOREAN-STYLE WESTERN CUISINE

257
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,745
CRISPY PORK CUTLET
DIPPED IN TANGY SAUCE FULL OF VEGGIES

258
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:23,483
LET'S DIG IN

259
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,086
BLOWING BEFORE TAKING A BITE

260
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:27,154
It looks good.

261
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:29,189
CAN'T HELP BUT EXCLAIM

262
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:31,291
Try it. It's scrumptious.

263
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,228
-It's a big portion.
-Yes, it is.

264
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:37,130
-There are three pieces, not two?
-It's three pieces.

265
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:44,204
A LARGE SERVING SIZE

266
00:11:46,507 --> 00:11:48,775
IT LOOKS LIKE TWO PIECES,
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY THREE

267
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,846
Let's fill our glasses with soju.

268
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,681
This is…

269
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,351
It tastes even better.

270
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,520
ONE BITE HIGHLIGHTS THE TRADITIONAL TASTE

271
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:01,421
It tastes just like the old days.

272
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:04,825
-Exactly.
-This is worth 10,000 won.

273
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:09,796
-Look at the breadcrumbs.
-They use moist breadcrumbs here.

274
00:12:10,364 --> 00:12:14,134
Wet breadcrumbs are full of moisture,
so it gets crispier.

275
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:18,505
This tastes like it was made
by one of my friend's moms,

276
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,140
-who's a great cook.
-Exactly.

277
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:25,512
THE IDEAL HANDMADE PORK CUTLET

278
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,916
-Are these bell peppers?
-Yes, they are.

279
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,551
Bell peppers are expensive now.

280
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:33,387
It's sweet and sour.
How come it tastes like this?

281
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:35,522
-It probably costs more than the meat.
-Yum.

282
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,024
I want to say something.

283
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:41,361
People don't eat the veggies
in <i>kkanpunggi </i>or <i>tangsuyuk.</i>

284
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,897
-They don't eat them.
-People pick them out.

285
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:46,099
But you shouldn't do that.

286
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,969
-You have to eat it together.
-You should eat it all.

287
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:51,171
I thought they were
only there for decoration.

288
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:53,340
-No, they're not.
-People have that misconception.

289
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:56,743
-They have purpose.
-They must be there for a reason.

290
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:00,280
-It's irresistible.
-My glass is empty.

291
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:02,516
IT CALLS FOR SOJU

292
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,352
It's soju that goes well
with pork cutlet, not beer.

293
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:07,821
STARES

294
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,224
-It's really--
-Hey.

295
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,792
-It's really--
-Hey.

296
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:13,660
ANGRY NAMNO

297
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,662
FEELING HIS GAZE

298
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:19,399
I'M WATCHING YOU

299
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:23,704
-It's so good.
-I'm loving this.

300
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,673
A HALF-EMPTY GLASS IS UNACCEPTABLE
AMONG DRINKERS

301
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,177
-This is the best bar snack for soju.
-Yes, the soju tastes sweet.

302
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:32,446
The sauce is sweet and sour.

303
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,082
PREFERS PORK CUTLET OVER ALCOHOL

304
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,852
There's an endless debate over pork cutlet
and stir-fried spicy pork.

305
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,188
-I always go for cutlet.
-How about you, Namno?

306
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:44,157
-It's hard to choose.
-Why can't we eat both?

307
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:46,593
What if you had to choose one?

308
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,595
-Of two?
-Pork cutlet or spicy pork?

309
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:49,730
I'd just die.

310
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,033
It's impossible. I can't choose.

311
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,303
If I had to choose,
I'd prefer stir-fried spicy pork.

312
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:01,141
Stir-fried spicy pork is a dish
that's more Korean.

313
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:04,444
-I see.
-That's why I like it more.

314
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,213
-Think it over.
-Since we have--

315
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,447
-Reconsider it.
-Okay.

316
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:09,116
I choose pork cutlet.

317
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:10,184
QUICKLY CHANGING SIDES

318
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,685
-I choose pork cutlet.
-Me too.

319
00:14:11,752 --> 00:14:12,753
EVERYONE PICKS CUTLET

320
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:18,492
ENDING THE DEBATE ON COMFORT FOOD
JUST FOR TODAY

321
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,694
-What's next?
-We ordered <i>yukhoe.</i>

322
00:14:20,761 --> 00:14:22,930
Oh, right. I'm a big fan of <i>yukhoe.</i>

323
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,731
-Do you like it?
-Absolutely.

324
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:31,972
THE OWNER STEPS OUT WHEN <i>YUKHOE </i>IS ORDERED

325
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:39,446
HE HEADS SOMEWHERE DOWN THE ALLEY

326
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,683
HE ARRIVES AT A TRADITIONAL MARKET

327
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:46,019
-Hello.
-Hi.

328
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:47,221
Hi, there.

329
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:50,757
AS SOON AS HE GETS AN ORDER

330
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:52,259
Goodbye.

331
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,194
-Thank you.
-Bye.

332
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:55,662
HE BUYS FRESH BEEF

333
00:14:58,065 --> 00:14:59,166
He's slicing raw beef.

334
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,002
I can hear it, too.

335
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:03,837
MOUTH-WATERING SOUND OF SLICING <i>YUKHOE</i>

336
00:15:04,505 --> 00:15:07,174
NUTTY PINE NUTS AND SESAME OIL

337
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:11,578
MAKING SWEET <i>YUKHOE </i>SEASONING
WITH MINCED GARLIC AND BLACK PEPPER

338
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:15,616
MIX IT ALL TOGETHER WITH THE FRESH BEEF

339
00:15:16,817 --> 00:15:20,687
PLATE THE FOOD NICELY

340
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:25,259
FRESH <i>YUKHOE</i>

341
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:27,761
HERE'S YOUR <i>YUKHOE</i>

342
00:15:27,828 --> 00:15:29,396
-Did you make this now?
-Yes.

343
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:30,898
They buy it at the market.

344
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:32,866
-Auntie, may I ask you a question?
-Sure.

345
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:36,603
How did you go from running a store
to running a restaurant?

346
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,173
-The corner store wasn't doing well.
-I see.

347
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,375
-Really?
-Business was really bad.

348
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:47,314
We used up the deposit and had to leave,
and we had no choice left.

349
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:49,550
I made spicy braised chicken
and cold noodles

350
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,686
and shared them with neighbors.
They said I should pursue this.

351
00:15:52,753 --> 00:15:54,121
-I see.
-Okay.

352
00:15:54,188 --> 00:15:57,524
-Because you're a great cook.
-So, I started making <i>gimbap.</i>

353
00:15:58,025 --> 00:16:00,561
-That led to more dishes and more people.
-Yes.

354
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,130
How come you're using that hair salon
as a waiting area?

355
00:16:03,197 --> 00:16:06,834
It was for customers
waiting outside in the cold.

356
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,802
It's for people who come from afar.

357
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:10,971
I felt so bad
for the people waiting outside.

358
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:13,173
They were shivering.

359
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,442
-I bought the place as a waiting area.
-Hold on.

360
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:18,278
Why do you think so many
customers come here?

361
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:20,414
-The food is tasty.
-That's the main reason.

362
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,216
-Next is hospitality.
-Right.

363
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:25,552
I stay true to my mindset,
and I don't raise prices despite costs.

364
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,456
She's always cheerful
whenever I come here.

365
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:31,158
I always give a warm welcome.

366
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:35,062
A WAITING AREA FOR CUSTOMERS

367
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:37,297
BUSAN STORE WAITING AREA

368
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,501
THEY ADDED MORE DISHES FOR CUSTOMERS

369
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:43,103
CLAM STEW, TOFU HOT POT, <i>GOPCHANG </i>HOT POT

370
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:49,042
THE COUPLE COOKS WITH LOVE

371
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:54,014
BUSAN STORE REMAINS IN THE SAME SPOT

372
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:55,883
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

373
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:03,390
KIWI, PEAR, AND EGG YOLK ARE ADDED
TO THE FRESH <i>YUKHOE</i>

374
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:05,425
-Let's try it your way.
-Okay.

375
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,427
-Are you making a dip?
-No.

376
00:17:07,995 --> 00:17:09,696
-You're beating the eggs.
-Yes.

377
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:12,032
POURING OVER THE <i>YUKHOE</i>

378
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:13,100
Let it seep through.

379
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:21,008
A RICH FLAVOR ADDED TO THE FRESH <i>YUKHOE</i>

380
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:23,510
<i>-It has pine nuts.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

381
00:17:23,577 --> 00:17:25,712
-Let's try it.
-That's a lot of pine nuts.

382
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:29,249
-How much is this?
-It's 30,000 won.

383
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:32,753
<i>That's about 50 grams of beef.</i>

384
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,688
-With 50 grams…
-A 30,000-won <i>yukhoe.</i>

385
00:17:34,755 --> 00:17:37,858
-Is that a good price?
-Pine nuts are expensive.

386
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:38,959
Let me have a bite.

387
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:42,629
TAEHOON TAKES A BIG BITE

388
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:46,433
Taehoon, is it delicious?

389
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,701
I think he likes it.

390
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:50,804
-Is it amazing?
-It's so good that it makes you cackle?

391
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:54,241
Yes, it's absolutely incredible.

392
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:58,045
The seasoning is just…

393
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,014
There are no words for this.

394
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:02,850
<i>-It's excellent.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>

395
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,585
THE PERFECT MEAT AND SEASONING

396
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:06,687
This is perfect with soju.

397
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,489
-Drink up.
-Pour me some.

398
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:11,658
SATISFIED NAMNO

399
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:14,795
I'M SORRY, PORK CUTLET

400
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:19,566
SNATCHES A SESAME SEED OFF TAEHOON'S FACE
AND POPS IT IN HIS MOUTH

401
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:22,803
Actually, I've never had <i>yukhoe </i>with kiwi.

402
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,271
I should try it together.

403
00:18:24,338 --> 00:18:26,406
We add blended kiwi
to the braised short ribs.

404
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:29,409
-As a meat tenderizer?
-Right.

405
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,880
-First of all, the beef is so fresh.
-Exactly.

406
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:35,249
The flavors are well-balanced.

407
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:36,517
Wait, the seasoning…

408
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:41,889
WHAT IS THIS?

409
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:42,990
They go well together.

410
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:46,293
I love it when the seeds pop.

411
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,461
UNEXPECTED KIWI PAIRING

412
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:50,564
Your cackle after eating was genuine.

413
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:51,965
I think the owner is

414
00:18:52,032 --> 00:18:53,100
"WHAT'S HER IDENTITY?"

415
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:56,403
the Master of Seasoning.

416
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:00,174
<i>The flavor of pine nuts,</i>
<i>the chewiness of raw beef,</i>

417
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,176
<i>-and the seasoning go well together.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

418
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:04,711
This might be sweet to someone.

419
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:06,547
But it's not just sweet.

420
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:09,716
The rich flavor deepens
the more you chew, so it gets better.

421
00:19:09,783 --> 00:19:12,019
Let's say we have <i>yukhoe </i>in the middle.

422
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:14,922
Then, we have saltiness on the left
and sweetness on the right.

423
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,290
They don't cross the line.

424
00:19:17,124 --> 00:19:19,927
They go back and forth,
but remain where they are.

425
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,663
Garlic and pine nuts
could feel like too much.

426
00:19:23,197 --> 00:19:25,098
<i>But it's not when you try it.</i>

427
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,403
When I came here, I was amazed
to see <i>yukhoe </i>on the menu.

428
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:32,139
It was nice that
they made it with fresh beef.

429
00:19:32,206 --> 00:19:35,409
I could tell the owner's experience
from this plate of <i>yukhoe.</i>

430
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:38,045
<i>The seasoning and balance were perfect.</i>

431
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:40,013
Should we order one more?

432
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:42,749
Shall we?

433
00:19:42,816 --> 00:19:44,084
This place is the best.

434
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:48,188
-It's great for shows.
-They have everything here.

435
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:53,827
SPICY CHILI <i>GIMBAP </i>WITH A CLEAN AFTERTASTE

436
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:58,532
SWEET, SOUR, AND CRISPY PORK CUTLET

437
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:03,303
FRESH <i>YUKHOE</i>
WHICH BECOMES UNAVAILABLE AFTER 8:00 P.M.

438
00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:04,938
I'm full.

439
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:07,441
-Taehoon, are you full?
-My stomach is about to burst.

440
00:20:07,508 --> 00:20:11,111
-I'm still hungry.
-But I think we should still eat <i>ramyeon.</i>

441
00:20:11,178 --> 00:20:13,814
-We definitely should.
-The kimchi here is so yummy.

442
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:17,184
<i>I feel like I need to try the </i>ramyeon<i>.</i>
<i>I think I'll regret it if I don't.</i>

443
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:20,153
CRAVING <i>RAMYEON</i>
DUE TO THE VARIETY OF KIMCHI

444
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,489
Namno always says,
<i>"Ramyeon </i>should be cooked

445
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:24,491
-in an even number of servings."
-Right.

446
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:26,960
-It started when we were little.
-Really?

447
00:20:27,027 --> 00:20:30,230
-We made big amounts of <i>ramyeon </i>as kids.
-How many did you two eat?

448
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:32,866
I used to eat up to six servings
in high school.

449
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:33,934
-By yourself?
-Yes.

450
00:20:34,001 --> 00:20:36,436
-We didn't use saucepans to make it.
-Except the soup.

451
00:20:37,037 --> 00:20:39,173
We didn't like small pots.
We used a stock pot.

452
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,707
We cooked it on the stove.

453
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:44,344
-High schoolers don't have any money.
-Right.

454
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:46,747
-It was hard to even buy some<i>.</i>
-That's right.

455
00:20:47,147 --> 00:20:49,583
But you ate six servings
when times were tough?

456
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,785
Do you have any stories?

457
00:20:51,852 --> 00:20:56,456
-About what?
-Comfort foods when you were struggling.

458
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:02,396
-There was something that made me smile.
-What?

459
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:04,631
-Was it a dish?
-It wasn't a meal.

460
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:06,300
<i>Custard cupcakes.</i>

461
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:08,001
<i>-The snack?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

462
00:21:08,068 --> 00:21:11,538
<i>-Why?</i>
<i>-When times were tough, I would eat…</i>

463
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:13,740
<i>-Tasty.</i>
<i>-…a frozen custard cupcake with milk.</i>

464
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:15,175
<i>It tasted like heaven.</i>

465
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:17,544
-I have something like that, too.
-What?

466
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:20,414
I hated it when I was little,
but I love it now.

467
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:23,717
-It's cold noodles.
-I see.

468
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:26,486
My family ran a cold noodle shop,
but it closed down.

469
00:21:27,521 --> 00:21:29,756
I got bullied a lot in middle school.

470
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,860
They'd say, "Your mom's wearing
an apron on a motorcycle."

471
00:21:32,926 --> 00:21:36,163
-Don't you also know that feeling?
-Of course.

472
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,798
Your parents did food deliveries.

473
00:21:37,865 --> 00:21:40,734
I was hurt when I was little.
That's why I hated that food.

474
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:44,471
<i>I started eating cold noodles again</i>
<i>when I was in my mid-20s.</i>

475
00:21:44,538 --> 00:21:46,540
<i>-When you were a kid…</i>
<i>-I just hated it.</i>

476
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,276
My parents ran a Chinese restaurant.

477
00:21:49,343 --> 00:21:53,580
-Right, you told us before.
-Yes, they ran it for about 17 years.

478
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:55,282
I don't really eat <i>jjajangmyeon.</i>

479
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:57,518
-Still?
-Yes, even now.

480
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:00,521
Here are your instant black noodles.

481
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:02,823
-Do you eat instant black noodles?
-Of course.

482
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:06,026
I love it<i>. </i>Nice timing.

483
00:22:08,095 --> 00:22:09,496
GREAT WITH GREEN ONION KIMCHI

484
00:22:09,563 --> 00:22:10,764
<i>Eat them together.</i>

485
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:14,635
<i>Green onion kimchi has</i>
<i>a bit of a bitter taste.</i>

486
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:17,804
It goes well with the black noodle's
salty and sweet flavor.

487
00:22:19,072 --> 00:22:22,476
My gosh, look at this.
I'm full, but why am I eating this?

488
00:22:22,543 --> 00:22:24,211
-"My gosh"?
-I understand.

489
00:22:24,278 --> 00:22:28,348
We would've stopped eating,
but we keep receiving good food.

490
00:22:28,415 --> 00:22:30,317
-It smells different.
-Exactly.

491
00:22:31,251 --> 00:22:36,390
People don't realize this,
but bitter flavor is very important.

492
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:39,326
-I mixed it again.
-Oh, in here?

493
00:22:39,393 --> 00:22:41,195
SLURPS IT WITH GREEN ONION KIMCHI

494
00:22:41,261 --> 00:22:42,796
This is unbelievable.

495
00:22:43,997 --> 00:22:46,600
INSTANT BLACK NOODLES <i>MUKBANG</i>
BY A CHINESE CUISINE CHEF

496
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:50,204
-Why does watching him eat make me laugh?
-Just amazing.

497
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:54,508
<i>He says he's full, but he's eating.</i>

498
00:22:54,575 --> 00:22:55,776
YOU FORGET YOU'RE FULL

499
00:22:56,677 --> 00:23:00,514
THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM
FOR THE ADDICTIVE INSTANT BLACK NOODLES

500
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:02,716
HERE COMES THE <i>RAMYEON</i>

501
00:23:02,783 --> 00:23:04,484
-Here you go.
-Oh, my gosh.

502
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:06,854
-Homemade.
-Is it store-bought?

503
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,889
Hold on, Taehoon.
We need to show them this.

504
00:23:08,956 --> 00:23:10,724
-He's the <i>ramyeon </i>expert.
-I am.

505
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:13,093
I can tell by the water.

506
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,829
-You added a little water for the eggs.
-That's right.

507
00:23:17,264 --> 00:23:18,265
-Is it perfect?
-Yes.

508
00:23:18,332 --> 00:23:19,600
Look at this.

509
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:21,268
RIGHT AMOUNT OF WATER WITH THE EGGS

510
00:23:21,335 --> 00:23:23,136
-Now the kimchi.
-Eat it with kimchi.

511
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,143
A BITE WITH KIMCHI

512
00:23:30,944 --> 00:23:32,012
This is crazy.

513
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,080
-Is it amazing?
-Yes.

514
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:34,147
Let's dig in.

515
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,585
-Look at the chewy noodles.
-Seriously.

516
00:23:38,652 --> 00:23:40,687
It's like simple, homemade <i>ramyeon.</i>

517
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:44,591
<i>RAMYEON </i>EXPERT ALSO DIGS IN

518
00:23:45,826 --> 00:23:50,597
<i>RAMYEON MUKBANG </i>GOES ON
FOR THOSE WHO ARE FULL

519
00:23:50,664 --> 00:23:55,235
I wanted to ask
what your go-to spots mean to you.

520
00:23:55,302 --> 00:23:57,804
It's about whether I can
spend time in the place.

521
00:23:58,272 --> 00:24:02,876
I ask myself if it's comfortable for me
spending two or three hours here.

522
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:04,978
Go-to spots are supposed
to be comfortable.

523
00:24:05,045 --> 00:24:08,982
The act of going out to eat
requires you to make reservations…

524
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:12,152
-It isn't easy.
-…do your hair, and dress up.

525
00:24:12,219 --> 00:24:13,587
It takes hours.

526
00:24:13,654 --> 00:24:16,456
-Almost a full day.
-It takes up half of the day.

527
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:20,294
So, if I'm enjoying my time,
I think it becomes my go-to spot.

528
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:25,165
If we spend a nice time here together,

529
00:24:25,232 --> 00:24:29,503
then this place becomes
my go-to restaurant.

530
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,271
That's why you like this area.

531
00:24:31,338 --> 00:24:33,307
-Exactly.
-I get it.

532
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:36,777
<i>I'm excited when I walk these streets.</i>

533
00:24:36,844 --> 00:24:40,147
<i>The time I spend looking forward</i>
<i>to coming here is the fun of it.</i>

534
00:24:40,214 --> 00:24:41,548
EXCITED FOR HIS GO-TO SPOT

535
00:24:44,618 --> 00:24:49,423
AT THE END OF THE ALLEY
LIES HIS GO-TO PLACE

536
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:51,458
BUSAN STORE

537
00:24:54,862 --> 00:24:55,863
That's impressive.

538
00:24:57,931 --> 00:25:00,467
-What did he say?
-I liked what he said.

539
00:25:00,534 --> 00:25:01,935
-Okay.
-Weren't you listening?

540
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:03,871
-Why won't you listen?
-I'm drunk.

541
00:25:03,937 --> 00:25:04,938
TEACHING NAMNO LESSONS

542
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:07,307
If you're finished, there's dessert left.

543
00:25:08,141 --> 00:25:11,945
-Just kill us already.
-There's always room for dessert.

544
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:13,013
-Let's go.
-Okay.

545
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,516
-That was a great meal.
-Namno will be paying.

546
00:25:15,582 --> 00:25:16,850
-Because he lost.
-Right.

547
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:19,186
I thought round two was it.

548
00:25:21,822 --> 00:25:23,323
<i>Man, that was an incredible meal.</i>

549
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,692
<i>-Auntie.</i>
<i>-Yes?</i>

550
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:29,229
<i>-You're an expert in seasoning.</i>
<i>-Seasoning is the most important thing.</i>

551
00:25:29,296 --> 00:25:31,465
<i>-It's unbelievable.</i>
<i>-Seasoning is important.</i>

552
00:25:32,132 --> 00:25:33,700
Here you go. Thank you.

553
00:25:33,767 --> 00:25:35,068
-Was the food okay?
-Yes.

554
00:25:35,135 --> 00:25:36,470
FOOD IS ON NAMNO

555
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:38,805
-I'll come back in three days.
-Sure.

556
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:40,641
CAN'T WAIT TO RETURN TO THIS GO-TO SPOT

557
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:51,985
-Let's take a stroll to digest our food.
-Sounds great. Let's walk.

558
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:55,389
We're not having jumbo dumplings, are we?
I see the sign.

559
00:25:55,923 --> 00:25:57,691
-We're here.
-Here it is.

560
00:25:57,758 --> 00:25:59,459
-Here?
-Old-school cream-filled bread.

561
00:25:59,526 --> 00:26:01,895
Our last stop is
old-school cream-filled bread.

562
00:26:01,962 --> 00:26:03,363
-Am I right?
-Yes.

563
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:07,935
<i>-The whipped cream here is cold.</i>
<i>-Have a bite.</i>

564
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:09,970
You have to eat it quickly.

565
00:26:10,037 --> 00:26:12,039
HOT AND COLD
FROZEN CREAM AND TOASTED BUN

566
00:26:12,105 --> 00:26:13,941
-It's frozen.
-Yes.

567
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:15,142
This is insane.

568
00:26:16,043 --> 00:26:18,612
Even if you're full,
this tastes great after spicy food.

569
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:20,547
-It's like ice cream.
-Yes.

570
00:26:21,114 --> 00:26:23,116
<i>-This is terrific.</i>
<i>-I can eat more now.</i>

571
00:26:23,183 --> 00:26:24,184
<i>Let's go eat more.</i>

572
00:26:24,952 --> 00:26:25,986
<i>I think I can.</i>

573
00:26:26,053 --> 00:26:27,754
It's time for dinner. Let's go eat.

574
00:26:27,821 --> 00:26:29,623
-Of course.
-Let's go have dinner.

575
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,326
-Do you know a good place?
-Yes. Have dinner first.

576
00:26:32,392 --> 00:26:34,595
-This is amazing.
-I love this neighborhood.
