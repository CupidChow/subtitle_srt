HOEHYEON-DONG, SEOUL

5
00:00:07,183 --> 00:00:10,820
<i>-We're at Namdaemun.</i>
<i>-Yes, this is the famous Namdaemun Market.</i>

6
00:00:12,355 --> 00:00:15,292
<i>-It's packed with people.</i>
<i>-That's how a market should be.</i>

7
00:00:16,026 --> 00:00:19,362
-Do you come here often?
-Absolutely.

8
00:00:20,263 --> 00:00:24,701
<i>The Namdaemun Market</i>
<i>has been running for over 600 years.</i>

9
00:00:26,136 --> 00:00:29,439
<i>-There are tons of clothing stores.</i>
<i>-They are well-made.</i>

10
00:00:29,506 --> 00:00:30,807
LOTS OF CLOTHING STORES

11
00:00:30,874 --> 00:00:32,943
<i>It's a long-standing, huge market.</i>

12
00:00:33,476 --> 00:00:36,947
-It's known for its variety of good foods.
-Exactly.

13
00:00:37,013 --> 00:00:40,617
I've never been there,
but I heard the <i>Kalguksu </i>Alley is famous.

14
00:00:40,684 --> 00:00:43,019
<i>KALGUKSU </i>ALLEY IS A MUST-VISIT

15
00:00:43,086 --> 00:00:45,322
<i>I've also heard of Hairtail Alley.</i>

16
00:00:45,388 --> 00:00:47,457
ANOTHER MUST-VISIT, HAIRTAIL ALLEY

17
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,928
THERE ARE MANY OTHER FOOD OPTIONS AS WELL

18
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:56,833
300,000 TO 500,000 PEOPLE VISIT
THIS STREET FOOD MECCA EVERY DAY

19
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,303
Anyway, I'm very curious
to meet today's chef.

20
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,638
Who invited today's chef?

21
00:01:01,705 --> 00:01:03,640
-I did.
-The hairy guy did.

22
00:01:03,707 --> 00:01:06,843
He's the top street food chef.
That's why we came to this market.

23
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,378
-Does he make street food?
-Yes.

24
00:01:08,445 --> 00:01:11,681
-He's the best.
-Who could it be?

25
00:01:11,748 --> 00:01:14,084
He's a food truck legend in the US.

26
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,119
His business earns
60 billion won annually.

27
00:01:16,186 --> 00:01:18,388
-Dang, that's a lot.
-Definitely.

28
00:01:18,455 --> 00:01:21,691
He is a very close friend of mine.

29
00:01:21,758 --> 00:01:23,493
-I can say this with confidence.
-Okay.

30
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,130
But I've never met him in person.

31
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,399
We go way back.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,935
It's been about six to seven years.

33
00:01:32,002 --> 00:01:34,604
-For that many years…
-Someone is coming.

34
00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:36,339
Is he here already? He's here!

35
00:01:37,374 --> 00:01:40,844
-I finally get to meet him.
-What's happening?

36
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:43,613
-Hello.
-You've never met him, right?

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,482
It's our first time meeting.

38
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:48,919
I'm Song Junghun from Utah.

39
00:01:48,985 --> 00:01:51,087
I started my business in a small truck,

40
00:01:51,154 --> 00:01:53,123
and I'm working hard
to promote Korean food.

41
00:01:53,924 --> 00:01:59,129
<i>CUPBAP </i>IS RICE IN A CUP
WITH KOREAN TOPPINGS

42
00:01:59,195 --> 00:02:01,698
-Korea!
<i>-Cupbap!</i>

43
00:02:01,765 --> 00:02:03,600

44
00:02:04,467 --> 00:02:07,404

SONG JUNGHUN
CEO OF C*PBOP IN UTAH

48
00:02:18,615 --> 00:02:22,519
I'm thrilled to meet him,
but it's awkward at the same time.

49
00:02:22,586 --> 00:02:25,055
-Hasn't it been six to seven years?
-That's right.

50
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:28,158
We've stayed in touch.
It's my first time seeing him in person.

51
00:02:28,225 --> 00:02:30,026
Neither of you can make eye contact.

52
00:02:30,093 --> 00:02:31,094
TOO SHY

53
00:02:32,996 --> 00:02:34,898
I texted you the assignment.

54
00:02:34,965 --> 00:02:36,833
-Yes, I received it.
-I got it.

55
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,169
-Did everyone do it?
-Of course.

56
00:02:39,236 --> 00:02:40,403
I prepared thoroughly.

57
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:43,540
LET'S EACH FIND A FAMOUS STREET FOOD PLACE

58
00:02:43,607 --> 00:02:44,674
DUJUN: OKAY, DAVID!

59
00:02:44,741 --> 00:02:46,776
TAEHOON: GOT IT.

60
00:02:46,843 --> 00:02:50,513
You built a successful business
with the street food, <i>cupbap.</i>

61
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,652
What do you think is important for
succeeding in the street food business?

62
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:59,589
There are three key factors
that I focus on.

63
00:02:59,656 --> 00:03:01,892
-The first one is performance.
-Performance?

64
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:06,229
Like the way you present things visually.
Visual appeal is very important.

65
00:03:06,296 --> 00:03:08,531
-Secondly, the price.
-I see.

66
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:10,433
Street food should be reasonably priced.

67
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,003
And last, but most importantly, the taste.

68
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:15,038
After hearing the three factors,

69
00:03:15,105 --> 00:03:19,109
I think the place I found
fits them perfectly.

70
00:03:19,175 --> 00:03:20,477
Really?

71
00:03:20,544 --> 00:03:22,245
It's just ahead.

72
00:03:22,312 --> 00:03:24,281
-Let's go.
-Sure.

73
00:03:24,347 --> 00:03:25,515
-I'm curious.
-Off we go.

74
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:26,950
Let's get going.

75
00:03:27,517 --> 00:03:28,718
You will be surprised.

76
00:03:28,785 --> 00:03:30,520
LEADING WITH CONFIDENCE

77
00:03:30,587 --> 00:03:33,924
I love having this food as a snack.

78
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:37,561
-I can't wait to see what it is.
-I'd better not get too excited.

79
00:03:37,627 --> 00:03:38,828
FEELING EXCITED ALREADY

80
00:03:39,663 --> 00:03:41,298
We're here.

81
00:03:41,898 --> 00:03:44,301
-Hello.
-I've never had this.

82
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:46,002
-Hello.
-Hi.

83
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:48,204
<i>-"Hotteok, </i>the best of the best."
-Here it is.

84
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:50,173
"Kim Jinho, the <i>Hotteok </i>King."

85
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,042
He does business in his name.

86
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,781
LOCATED RIGHT IN FRONT OF HOEHYEON STATION

87
00:03:58,381 --> 00:04:00,450
IRRESISTIBLE SMELL AND SOUND

88
00:04:01,017 --> 00:04:03,286
THE APPETIZING NAME, <i>HOTTEOK</i>

89
00:04:03,353 --> 00:04:04,354
<i>Hotteok?</i>

90
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:07,591
I've been here many times,
yet I've never noticed this.

91
00:04:07,657 --> 00:04:09,459
Oh, you've never had this.

92
00:04:09,526 --> 00:04:11,661
I didn't think we would eat this.

93
00:04:12,028 --> 00:04:15,865
The owner has been running
this business for 35 years.

94
00:04:15,932 --> 00:04:18,435
His son is carrying on
the family business.

95
00:04:18,501 --> 00:04:22,205
-Hello.
-He's continuing the business.

96
00:04:22,272 --> 00:04:25,809
-They sell about 1,000 of these every day.
-Really?

97
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,480
-What's the most popular item?
-It's sticky rice and honey <i>hotteok.</i>

98
00:04:30,547 --> 00:04:32,382
-Got it.
-Sticky rice and honey <i>hotteok.</i>

99
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:34,818
-Shall we have a bite?
-Sure.

100
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:38,388
-Check out his performance.
-It's awesome.

101
00:04:38,455 --> 00:04:42,759
-It's amazing. He's so quick.
-He easily flips it.

102
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,663
WITH 35 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE

00:04:47,297 --> 00:04:51,067
THE <i>HOTTEOK </i>IS PREPARED
RIGHT BEFORE THEIR EYES

104
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:55,105
WHO WILL TAKE THE FIRST BITE?

105
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:56,773
Please go ahead.

106
00:04:57,607 --> 00:05:00,710
-It's super hot. Be careful.
-Be careful with the honey.

107
00:05:00,777 --> 00:05:01,878
I've never tried this.

108
00:05:01,945 --> 00:05:04,614
<i>Hotteok </i>is famous in our country.

109
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:06,216
CHEWY

110
00:05:06,983 --> 00:05:10,287
THE <i>HOTTEOK </i>IS QUITE CHEWY

111
00:05:11,454 --> 00:05:12,789
Wow, it's scrumptious.

112
00:05:12,856 --> 00:05:16,092
I've heard that you got a patent
for your batter.

113
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,695
I didn't know you could patent that.

114
00:05:18,762 --> 00:05:21,698
-The certificate is hung over there.
-I see it.

115
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:25,402
HE PATENTED
HIS UNIQUE BATTER MIX AND RECIPE

116
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:30,674
BOOSTS THE BATTER'S CHEWINESS AND FLAVOR

117
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,476
Oh, thank you.

118
00:05:33,543 --> 00:05:34,945
TAEHOON ALSO TAKES A BITE

119
00:05:35,745 --> 00:05:36,746
It looks good.

120
00:05:38,014 --> 00:05:39,683
-Is it hot?
-Oh, no.

121
00:05:41,585 --> 00:05:42,586
How is it?

122
00:05:43,086 --> 00:05:44,087
It's tasty.

123
00:05:44,154 --> 00:05:48,291
Sir, you didn't use much oil,
but it's still amazing.

124
00:05:48,358 --> 00:05:49,826
WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY THAT?

125
00:05:49,893 --> 00:05:53,964
The <i>hotteok </i>we're familiar with
is usually made with margarine.

126
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,399
<i>They usually make it</i>
<i>with a ton of cooking oil.</i>

127
00:05:56,466 --> 00:05:58,768
<i>But there isn't much oil here.</i>

128
00:05:58,835 --> 00:06:00,637
<i>-There's only a small amount.</i>
<i>-I agree.</i>

129
00:06:00,704 --> 00:06:03,106
<i>Since it's not as oily,</i>
<i>it's a healthy snack.</i>

130
00:06:03,173 --> 00:06:04,174
<i>It's light.</i>

131
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:08,345
<i>For people with allergies,</i>
<i>we don't use peanuts or walnuts.</i>

132
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:12,215
<i>We use sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds,</i>
<i>sesame seeds, and bean powder instead.</i>

133
00:06:14,351 --> 00:06:15,752
Wow, it's incredible.

134
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,722
<i>Americans would love this</i>

135
00:06:18,788 --> 00:06:21,491
<i>-since nut allergies are common in the US.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

136
00:06:21,858 --> 00:06:23,393
Oh, this is unbelievable.

137
00:06:25,228 --> 00:06:29,065
THE MORE YOU KNOW, THE TASTIER IT IS

138
00:06:29,132 --> 00:06:31,468
-Do you remember the three key elements?
-Yes.

139
00:06:31,534 --> 00:06:34,471
-He makes it right in front of you.
-Exactly.

140
00:06:34,537 --> 00:06:36,706
1. PERFORMANCE THAT DRAWS ATTENTION

141
00:06:36,773 --> 00:06:38,909
-It's affordable as well.
-I agree.

142
00:06:38,975 --> 00:06:40,043
2. AFFORDABLE PRICE

143
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:47,050
I'm surprised that he even considered
customers with nut allergies.

144
00:06:47,117 --> 00:06:48,118
Look behind you.

145
00:06:48,184 --> 00:06:49,853
THERE ARE TOURISTS BEHIND THEM

146
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,722
You have to try this one.
It's really good.

147
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:54,658
JUNGHUN ACTIVELY PROMOTES THE <i>HOTTEOK</i>

148
00:06:54,724 --> 00:06:59,262
We used to get many Japanese
and Chinese tourists.

149
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:01,765
Now tourists are from Europe,
the Middle East…

150
00:07:01,831 --> 00:07:04,034
-From the Middle East?
-That's right.

151
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,470
I give it a 9.8 out of 10.

152
00:07:08,572 --> 00:07:11,408
-It was fantastic.
-I do my best.

153
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:14,911
<i>-Thank you, sir. Take care.</i>
<i>-Thank you.</i>

154
00:07:14,978 --> 00:07:16,980
STREET FOOD MADE WITH GREAT PERFORMANCE

155
00:07:17,047 --> 00:07:18,248
<i>Let's move on.</i>

156
00:07:20,317 --> 00:07:21,851
-I loved the <i>hotteok.</i>
-Excellent.

157
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:23,253
HEADING TO THE NEXT STOP

158
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,854
-It was a great choice.
-Right.

159
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:28,558
There's a ton of great street food
in our country.

160
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,460
But nothing beats <i>hotteok.</i>

161
00:07:30,794 --> 00:07:32,429
<i>It was good, but it's not the best.</i>

162
00:07:32,896 --> 00:07:36,233
<i>Now, this is the king of street food.</i>

163
00:07:36,299 --> 00:07:37,634
THE NUMBER ONE STREET FOOD

164
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:39,903
Tteokbokki, <i>fishcake, and deep-fried food.</i>

165
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,705
<i>Nothing compares to this.</i>

166
00:07:41,771 --> 00:07:45,976
A <i>BUNSIK </i>BAR THAT EVEN SELLS NOODLES

167
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:48,178
-Hello.
-Hi.

168
00:07:48,245 --> 00:07:49,512
-Nice to meet you, sir.
-Hi.

-He's good-looking.

00:07:51,882 --> 00:07:54,851
This store has been here for 21 years.

171
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:59,522
He took over the family business
a few years ago.

172
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:03,627
Right, I learned from my mother
and took over after being discharged.

173
00:08:03,693 --> 00:08:05,228
He's a devoted son.

174
00:08:05,295 --> 00:08:07,964
-How about having some <i>tteokbokki?</i>
-That sounds great.

175
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:10,634
-Let's have some noodles, too.
-Absolutely.

176
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,402
Wow, I can't wait to try it.

177
00:08:16,806 --> 00:08:18,375
My mouth is watering.

178
00:08:21,545 --> 00:08:23,013
Here is your <i>tteokbokki.</i>

179
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:25,749
Wow, this is the stuff.

180
00:08:25,815 --> 00:08:27,017
THE <i>TTEOKBOKKI </i>IS READY

181
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,486
EVERYONE TAKES A BITE

182
00:08:29,553 --> 00:08:31,621
-Isn't it good?
-It sure is.

183
00:08:33,123 --> 00:08:34,124
I'm loving this.

184
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:38,528
DELICIOUS FROM THE VERY FIRST BITE

185
00:08:39,563 --> 00:08:40,830
This tastes amazing.

186
00:08:40,897 --> 00:08:42,065
PLEASANTLY SPICY

187
00:08:44,935 --> 00:08:46,536
Oh, it's so chewy.

188
00:08:47,704 --> 00:08:52,008
-Is this made with wheat rice cake?
-Yes, it is.

189
00:08:52,075 --> 00:08:54,844
How long do you let the seasoning rest?

190
00:08:54,911 --> 00:08:58,114
-About two to three weeks.
-Yes, about that long.

191
00:08:58,181 --> 00:08:59,683
We make it in advance.

192
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,619
<i>-They make the seasoning beforehand.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

193
00:09:03,086 --> 00:09:05,889
<i>Unfermented and fermented seasoning</i>

194
00:09:05,956 --> 00:09:07,624
<i>-taste completely different.</i>
<i>-Really?</i>

195
00:09:08,858 --> 00:09:10,994
THE SPICINESS HAS A RICH UMAMI

196
00:09:11,061 --> 00:09:14,497
Look at the prices.
The kimchi noodles are 2,000 won.

197
00:09:14,564 --> 00:09:17,467
Wait, they even raised the price,
and it's still 2,000 won.

198
00:09:18,235 --> 00:09:20,770
-How much was it before?
-It used to cost 1,000 won.

199
00:09:20,837 --> 00:09:22,339
It's still really affordable.

200
00:09:22,405 --> 00:09:24,441
The price rose to 1,500
and then 2,000 won.

201
00:09:26,843 --> 00:09:29,379
<i>He uses the fishcake broth</i>
<i>for the noodles.</i>

202
00:09:30,513 --> 00:09:32,048
HERE YOU GO

203
00:09:32,849 --> 00:09:36,319
-Kimchi noodles are here.
-Let's each have a bite of this.

204
00:09:37,354 --> 00:09:40,891
The price is just unbelievable.

205
00:09:44,928 --> 00:09:46,563
IMMERSED IN THE NOODLES

206
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,231
Wow, he's loving it.

207
00:09:48,298 --> 00:09:49,532
How is it?

208
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,769
-Wait a second.
-Don't talk to him when he's eating.

209
00:09:53,803 --> 00:09:56,206
Wow, you have to try it with the broth.

210
00:09:56,273 --> 00:09:57,540
Kimchi is a must.

211
00:10:00,477 --> 00:10:02,245
It's rich in umami.

212
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:04,848
It went down the wrong pipe.

213
00:10:04,915 --> 00:10:06,182
SWALLOWED WRONG

214
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:07,250
Drink the broth.

215
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,189
-Isn't it delicious?
-This is insane.

216
00:10:14,224 --> 00:10:16,960
-Let me try the fishcake.
-Be careful. The broth is hot.

217
00:10:20,897 --> 00:10:21,898
It's great.

218
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:24,935
Sir, do you usually add fishcakes?

219
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:26,603
The kimchi pieces are big, too.

220
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,471
I can't believe this is only 2,000 won.

221
00:10:29,105 --> 00:10:31,741
I should come here for hangover cures.

222
00:10:32,442 --> 00:10:36,513
-Is this really 2,000 won?
-Yes, and it's a huge portion, too.

223
00:10:39,516 --> 00:10:43,887
My mother told me that there needs to be
something affordable for people to eat,

224
00:10:43,954 --> 00:10:48,058
so the market vendors and office workers
can comfortably eat it on their commute.

225
00:10:48,124 --> 00:10:50,327
CONTINUING WHAT HIS MOTHER STARTED

226
00:10:50,393 --> 00:10:54,531
When we first started
businesses in the US,

227
00:10:54,598 --> 00:10:57,534
Korean food was unfamiliar.

228
00:10:57,601 --> 00:11:00,637
We couldn't make the food too spicy
or use salted shrimp.

229
00:11:00,704 --> 00:11:02,105
-There were limitations.
-Yes.

230
00:11:02,172 --> 00:11:07,043
When I first started selling <i>cupbap, </i>many
customers threw it away after smelling it.

231
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,446
-Right.
-Because they weren't used to it.

232
00:11:09,512 --> 00:11:13,316
But now, they want more spicy food.

233
00:11:13,383 --> 00:11:15,852
-I think we've gotten past a big hurdle.
-Exactly.

234
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:19,222
They have grown accustomed to Korean food.

235
00:11:19,823 --> 00:11:21,992
<i>They moved on to the next step.</i>

236
00:11:22,058 --> 00:11:23,526
<i>-Do they enjoy it now?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

237
00:11:24,427 --> 00:11:27,731
<i>-Lots of foreigners come here to eat.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

238
00:11:27,797 --> 00:11:28,999
<i>TTEOKBOKKI </i>IS NOW POPULAR

239
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:32,002
LOOKING FORWARD
TO THE FUTURE OF KOREAN FOOD

240
00:11:32,402 --> 00:11:35,739
This place also has all three key factors.

241
00:11:35,805 --> 00:11:38,208
Performance, taste,
and especially the price.

242
00:11:38,275 --> 00:11:40,377
The price is unbelievable.

243
00:11:40,977 --> 00:11:45,115
I'm worried if they even make
a profit from this.

244
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:48,084
I love that this place
ticks all three boxes.

245
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:50,687
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you.

246
00:11:50,754 --> 00:11:52,188
-It was amazing.
-Thank you.

247
00:11:52,856 --> 00:11:55,525
SIGNATURE STREET FOOD
AT A REASONABLE PRICE

248
00:11:56,326 --> 00:11:57,360
Let's get going.

249
00:11:57,427 --> 00:11:59,129
TIME FOR DUJUN'S STREET FOOD

250
00:12:00,163 --> 00:12:02,732
I love the vibes in the Namdaemun Market.

251
00:12:03,533 --> 00:12:06,236
PACKED WITH TOURISTS EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK

252
00:12:07,671 --> 00:12:12,008
PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES
AND CULTURES ALL COME TOGETHER

253
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:16,846
AND ENJOY THEIR TIME IN NAMDAEMUN MARKET

254
00:12:16,913 --> 00:12:19,349
-Where is it? Are we there yet?
-It's this place.

255
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:20,517
-Really?
-Yes.

256
00:12:21,284 --> 00:12:23,620
-I love it here.
-Hello.

257
00:12:23,687 --> 00:12:25,555
FINALLY ARRIVED

258
00:12:27,257 --> 00:12:30,694
They have twisted donuts,
red bean donuts, and fresh donuts.

259
00:12:32,495 --> 00:12:35,265
-It's been here for 40 years.
-That's amazing.

260
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:39,169
-I like twisted donuts.
-These are all my favorites.

261
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:40,437
Hello, ma'am.

262
00:12:40,503 --> 00:12:44,841
-We will have two of everything here.
-Got it.

263
00:12:44,908 --> 00:12:48,078
It's 5,000 won.
Isn't that a reasonable price?

264
00:12:48,144 --> 00:12:49,346
5,000 WON FOR 6 DONUTS

265
00:12:49,412 --> 00:12:52,549
These days,
nobody sells donuts at this price.

266
00:12:52,616 --> 00:12:54,251
Less than 1,000 won for one donut.

267
00:12:54,317 --> 00:12:56,319
They make the dough and deep-fry it.

268
00:12:56,386 --> 00:12:58,922
You can see
that gigantic iron pot over there.

269
00:12:58,989 --> 00:13:01,124
-They make it with that.
-Exactly.

270
00:13:01,191 --> 00:13:04,160
-That's the old-fashioned way.
-Absolutely.

271
00:13:04,828 --> 00:13:07,097
She doesn't even use a thermometer.

272
00:13:07,898 --> 00:13:09,766
She just uses gas to heat it up.

273
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,468
That's the way to do it.

274
00:13:11,534 --> 00:13:13,603
-I agree.
-It's tasty that way.

275
00:13:14,204 --> 00:13:15,472
She's a master at this.

276
00:13:15,538 --> 00:13:17,340
GAINED EXPERIENCE OVER THE YEARS

277
00:13:17,407 --> 00:13:20,143
Did you come all the way here
to eat donuts?

278
00:13:20,844 --> 00:13:23,013
-Can we eat it here?
-Of course.

279
00:13:24,781 --> 00:13:26,383
WHAT'S SHE COATING THE DONUTS WITH?

280
00:13:28,285 --> 00:13:30,554
I have a question.

281
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:36,059
She's making two donuts for us,
and she's now coating them with sugar.

282
00:13:36,126 --> 00:13:39,529
-Is it because it might melt?
-Right, because the sugar might melt.

283
00:13:39,596 --> 00:13:44,067
The sugar will melt from the heat
if you coat it as soon as it's deep-fried.

284
00:13:44,734 --> 00:13:46,136
-Shall we try it?
-Yes.

285
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:48,905
-Try the one you want.
-Got it.

286
00:13:54,411 --> 00:13:57,214
-Do you like it?
-Yes, it's delicious.

287
00:13:58,148 --> 00:14:00,450
-It's served right after it's deep-fried.
-Yes.

288
00:14:01,251 --> 00:14:03,820
TAEHOON TAKES A BITE OF THE RED BEAN DONUT

289
00:14:04,221 --> 00:14:06,056
DEVOURS IT IMMEDIATELY

290
00:14:06,122 --> 00:14:08,792
TAKES A BITE OF THE FRESH DONUT
AND THE TWISTED DONUT, TOO

291
00:14:08,858 --> 00:14:10,794
Wow, there's filling in the fresh donut.

292
00:14:11,528 --> 00:14:14,464
-What do you call this white stuff?
-White bean paste.

293
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:17,000
LIGHT AND SWEET PASTE
MADE WITH WHITE KIDNEY BEANS

294
00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:19,069
I love the sugary first bite,

295
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:23,373
but I also love it
when the donut melts in my mouth.

296
00:14:24,374 --> 00:14:27,377
And coating twisted donuts with sugar
is such a classic.

297
00:14:27,444 --> 00:14:29,212
-Definitely.
-This is the stuff.

298
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,683
Korean bakeries are trending
overseas these days.

299
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,652
They're called K-bakeries.

300
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:38,455
-These donuts are a staple for us.
-Right.

301
00:14:38,521 --> 00:14:40,423
-You can say it's one of the basics.
-Yes.

302
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,193
It looks like tourists
come here to try this.

303
00:14:43,727 --> 00:14:46,129
TOURISTS BEHIND THEM SEEM TO BE DEBATING

304
00:14:49,032 --> 00:14:50,033
HE'S PROMOTING THEM

305
00:14:55,205 --> 00:14:57,841
You ready? Here it comes.

306
00:14:57,908 --> 00:14:59,109
OPEN UP, HERE IT COMES

307
00:14:59,175 --> 00:15:00,477
GOT IT IN ONE GO

308
00:15:00,544 --> 00:15:01,711
Well done.

309
00:15:04,414 --> 00:15:05,916
YUM

310
00:15:12,856 --> 00:15:16,293
I'm so proud to see
many tourists come and go.

311
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:19,996
And they just try the food.
They were all eating when we were.

312
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,365
-And they really liked it.
-Exactly.

313
00:15:23,099 --> 00:15:25,502
-The donuts were awesome.
-Thank you, ma'am.

314
00:15:25,569 --> 00:15:27,504
K-BAKERY FLAVORS FASCINATE TOURISTS

315
00:15:27,571 --> 00:15:33,376
The three spots you introduced today
had really delicious food.

316
00:15:34,211 --> 00:15:36,546
But I have a go-to place
that I visit the most.

317
00:15:37,347 --> 00:15:40,317
I wanted to share this Namdaemun spot
with you all.

318
00:15:40,383 --> 00:15:42,552
How about we go there today?

319
00:15:42,619 --> 00:15:44,821
-Let's go, then.
-Do you trust me?

320
00:15:44,888 --> 00:15:46,623
-Of course.
-Let's get going.

321
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,291
Off we go.

322
00:15:48,358 --> 00:15:51,995
OFF TO SONG JUNGHUN'S GO-TO PLACE

323
00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:53,797
-Junghun.
-Yes?

324
00:15:53,863 --> 00:15:54,864
Are we there yet?

325
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:57,667
Just a bit further up. It's on the right.

326
00:15:57,734 --> 00:15:59,703
It will probably be packed with people.

327
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:03,373
They sell 7,000 to 8,000 pieces
of this food every day.

328
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,575
-Wait, 8,000?
-Yes.

329
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,646
-We're here. There's a line.
-There it is.

330
00:16:09,713 --> 00:16:11,314
Look at that steam coming out.

331
00:16:11,381 --> 00:16:13,149
This is the place.

332
00:16:13,216 --> 00:16:15,752
The performance is insane
even from out front.

333
00:16:15,819 --> 00:16:18,955
-Did you see the steam? It's unreal.
-It's jaw-dropping.

334
00:16:19,022 --> 00:16:22,225
<i>The crowd rushes to the store</i>
<i>when the steam comes out.</i>

335
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:24,928
<i>They're all foreigners.</i>
<i>Wow, there are tons of customers.</i>

336
00:16:24,995 --> 00:16:27,697
-Shall we go in?
-Is it possible?

337
00:16:27,764 --> 00:16:29,466
There's a place to eat inside.

338
00:16:30,033 --> 00:16:31,468
-Welcome.
-Excuse me.

339
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:34,604
PASSING THROUGH THE CROWD OF CUSTOMERS

340
00:16:36,773 --> 00:16:39,409
-Hello.
-Wow, what's this?

341
00:16:39,476 --> 00:16:42,779
-Hello, can we get through here?
-Yes, we have to pass through.

342
00:16:44,014 --> 00:16:46,116
-This is amazing.
-Look at them making it.

343
00:16:46,182 --> 00:16:47,751
They're super fast.

344
00:16:51,655 --> 00:16:56,126
-They're faster than machines.
-It's all handmade here.

345
00:16:56,192 --> 00:17:00,163
They steam and sell them
out front right away.

346
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,798
I see, everything is handmade.

347
00:17:01,865 --> 00:17:03,066
Sir, we'll head upstairs.

348
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:04,601
-Go up this way.
-Got it.

349
00:17:04,668 --> 00:17:06,169
-This was a surprise.
-Be careful.

350
00:17:07,103 --> 00:17:08,104
NARROW STAIRS

351
00:17:08,171 --> 00:17:09,839
The first floor is the kitchen.

352
00:17:09,906 --> 00:17:12,409
Are the upper floors where people eat?

353
00:17:12,475 --> 00:17:15,912
-It's very narrow here…
-Is there a dining area upstairs?

354
00:17:15,979 --> 00:17:18,548
-It's totally old school.
-Yes, there's a dining area.

355
00:17:18,615 --> 00:17:20,317
You may think it ends here.

356
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,119
-Is there another floor?
-Do we climb the stairs again?

357
00:17:23,186 --> 00:17:25,622
-Is there a third floor?
-Wow, so many stairs.

358
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:28,858
How good is this place to have…

359
00:17:28,925 --> 00:17:30,927
Right, maybe they kept adding more levels.

360
00:17:30,994 --> 00:17:32,128
Oh, my knees.

361
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,065
We're here.

362
00:17:35,131 --> 00:17:37,334
You take off your shoes
and sit here and eat.

363
00:17:38,101 --> 00:17:40,503
-This has a vintage vibe.
-It's unbelievable.

364
00:17:41,238 --> 00:17:43,773
<i>-Get a cushion, everyone.</i>
<i>-Oh, there are cushions.</i>

365
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,709
<i>-Oh, no.</i>
<i>-My knees.</i>

366
00:17:45,775 --> 00:17:47,911
THEIR LEGS ACHE AFTER THE CLIMB

367
00:17:47,978 --> 00:17:50,213
What do you think of this place?

368
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,215
It's rare to see
places like this nowadays.

369
00:17:52,282 --> 00:17:54,050
It's hard to see this in Seoul.

370
00:17:54,117 --> 00:17:56,052
Look at the hanging dishcloth.

371
00:17:57,821 --> 00:18:01,625
It would be perfect
with some toilet paper hanging there.

372
00:18:02,192 --> 00:18:03,460
There's a mic over there.

373
00:18:04,194 --> 00:18:05,195
What is it for?

374
00:18:05,262 --> 00:18:06,830
-You're right.
-There's a mic.

375
00:18:06,897 --> 00:18:10,967
The staff calls out the orders
to the cooks downstairs.

376
00:18:11,635 --> 00:18:13,570
-That's how they do it.
-That's incredible.

377
00:18:14,137 --> 00:18:15,138
This is new.

378
00:18:15,205 --> 00:18:20,577
You can't help but have high expectations
after seeing the entrance and first floor.

379
00:18:20,644 --> 00:18:22,012
That's how I felt immediately.

380
00:18:22,078 --> 00:18:25,916
After I get off the plane,
I come straight here.

381
00:18:26,283 --> 00:18:28,051
GETTING MORE CURIOUS

382
00:18:28,118 --> 00:18:29,352
Why don't you order for us?

383
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:31,454
-Can I order my favorites?
-Of course.

384
00:18:31,521 --> 00:18:33,890
The owner is way down there.

385
00:18:33,957 --> 00:18:36,893
So, we have to shout out to him,
and he'll come up.

386
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,395
Because there's no bell.

387
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:40,530
-Shall we call him on three?
-Sure.

388
00:18:40,597 --> 00:18:41,665
One, two, three.

389
00:18:41,731 --> 00:18:43,567
-Sir!
-Sir!

390
00:18:43,633 --> 00:18:45,235
-Sir!
-Sir!

391
00:18:48,338 --> 00:18:49,439
Here he comes!

392
00:18:49,506 --> 00:18:51,274
THE OWNER IS HERE

393
00:18:51,341 --> 00:18:53,610
Nice to meet you.

394
00:18:53,677 --> 00:18:55,845
-He looks so friendly.
-He brought us water.

395
00:18:55,912 --> 00:18:57,147
KWON OGI, OWNER

396
00:18:57,214 --> 00:18:59,783
-Sir, does he come here often?
-Of course.

397
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:02,919
He's the customer I feel I know best.

398
00:19:02,986 --> 00:19:05,021
I consider him my best friend.

399
00:19:05,088 --> 00:19:07,090
We will order a lot, sir.

400
00:19:07,157 --> 00:19:09,526
Sir, how long have you run this place?

401
00:19:09,593 --> 00:19:12,562
It's been about 17 to 18 years.

402
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:17,067
And I've been making dumplings
since I was 18 years old.

403
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:18,969
Wow, that's awesome.

404
00:19:19,035 --> 00:19:22,472
I'll get the kimchi dumplings
and meat dumplings that I always order.

405
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:25,709
I know the steamed buns are only
for takeout, but could we have some?

406
00:19:25,775 --> 00:19:27,911
-I want to introduce them to it.
-Got it.

407
00:19:27,978 --> 00:19:31,348
Could you order our food through the mic?

408
00:19:31,414 --> 00:19:33,516
-Would you like me to do that?
-Yes.

409
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,920
-I'll order your food that way.
-Thank you.

410
00:19:39,222 --> 00:19:42,659
One plate of kimchi dumplings,
meat dumplings, and steamed buns

411
00:19:42,726 --> 00:19:44,494
on the third floor, please.

412
00:19:48,465 --> 00:19:49,866
A plate each of kimchi dumplings,

413
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:51,601
meat dumplings, and steamed buns
on the third floor, please.

414
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:53,670
MADE THE ORDER TO THE FIRST FLOOR

415
00:19:55,772 --> 00:19:57,774
Koreans are used to this,

416
00:19:57,841 --> 00:20:00,310
but foreigners are
very unfamiliar with this.

417
00:20:00,644 --> 00:20:03,780
The owner placed the steamer
to steam the dumplings outside.

418
00:20:03,847 --> 00:20:07,117
<i>The steam pours out</i>
<i>the moment you open it.</i>

419
00:20:07,183 --> 00:20:10,387
<i>In the fall and winter,</i>
<i>there's usually more steam.</i>

420
00:20:10,453 --> 00:20:12,389
<i>-Foreigners are taken aback…</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

421
00:20:12,455 --> 00:20:14,991
<i>…since the steam bursts out in the cold.</i>

422
00:20:15,058 --> 00:20:17,427
This is also what I really like
about this place.

423
00:20:17,494 --> 00:20:20,430
The staff recognizes me
because I come very often.

424
00:20:20,497 --> 00:20:24,568
They say, "You're here again," and they
give me the dumplings that have burst.

425
00:20:24,634 --> 00:20:27,504
-"Have one more."
-Because they can't sell the damaged ones.

426
00:20:27,571 --> 00:20:30,774
You barely experience this overseas.

427
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:36,012
You would even have to pay a few dollars
for any extra sauce.

428
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:39,349
But here, they try to give more
to the customers.

429
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,784
The dumplings are ready.

430
00:20:42,185 --> 00:20:46,122
WHY ARE THE FOODIE BROTHERS SURPRISED?

431
00:20:46,189 --> 00:20:47,724
Wow, this is wild.

432
00:20:48,491 --> 00:20:49,893
INSANE VISUALS

433
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,161
It looks fantastic.

434
00:20:55,765 --> 00:21:00,670
10 SERVINGS OF JUMBO DUMPLINGS

435
00:21:04,274 --> 00:21:05,308
This is a lot.

436
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,476
STANDS UP TO PHOTOGRAPH

437
00:21:07,744 --> 00:21:10,981
2 MOUNTAINS OF DUMPLINGS

438
00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:13,183
I also brought the steamed buns.

439
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,619
Dang, look at those.

440
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,923
Try the meat first, then the kimchi,
and end with the buns.

441
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:24,027
-Because the sweet ones…
-The steamed buns are for dessert.

442
00:21:24,628 --> 00:21:28,698
MEAT JUMBO DUMPLINGS

443
00:21:29,266 --> 00:21:36,239
KIMCHI JUMBO DUMPLINGS

444
00:21:37,173 --> 00:21:41,011
STEAMED BUNS

445
00:21:42,546 --> 00:21:46,283
-Why is there so much food?
-It doesn't usually come out like this.

446
00:21:46,349 --> 00:21:49,252
It's usually four dumplings per serving.

447
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:52,889
But I ordered a lot
because it's been a long day.

448
00:21:53,924 --> 00:21:56,826
Everyone take a dumpling,

449
00:21:56,893 --> 00:21:58,895
and quickly split it in half.

450
00:21:58,962 --> 00:22:01,698
-Then the steam gushes out like this.
-Exactly.

451
00:22:01,765 --> 00:22:03,600
1. SPLIT THE MEAT JUMBO DUMPLING IN HALF

452
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:04,868
And then…

453
00:22:05,802 --> 00:22:08,238
You have to eat the entire half in one go.

454
00:22:08,905 --> 00:22:09,906
Got it.

455
00:22:09,973 --> 00:22:12,976
2. DEVOUR THE HALF IN ONE BITE

456
00:22:16,146 --> 00:22:18,882
-Wow, it's delicious.
-You have to eat it like this.

457
00:22:21,251 --> 00:22:22,419
In one go.

458
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:29,292
IT'S HOT

459
00:22:33,797 --> 00:22:38,034
<i>It's rare to see dumplings this juicy.</i>

460
00:22:38,602 --> 00:22:43,139
<i>But they're super juicy, maybe because</i>
<i>they make them and steam them right away.</i>

461
00:22:46,142 --> 00:22:48,378
FILL A WRAPPER WITH PLENTY OF FILLING

462
00:22:49,646 --> 00:22:55,318
MAKE AND STEAM THEM ON THE SPOT

463
00:22:56,786 --> 00:22:59,522
JUICY MEAT JUMBO DUMPLINGS ARE READY

464
00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:00,624
I'll have one more.

465
00:23:01,391 --> 00:23:03,059
It burst, so I'll just eat it whole.

466
00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:07,497
The dumplings are amazing here.

467
00:23:08,698 --> 00:23:10,667
DUJUN ALSO EATS ONE MORE

468
00:23:10,734 --> 00:23:11,801
Isn't it good?

469
00:23:11,868 --> 00:23:15,071
-The seasoning is perfect.
-That's why I don't add anything else.

470
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,441
And the ground pepper.

471
00:23:19,175 --> 00:23:21,044
-It's the perfect amount.
-Right.

472
00:23:21,111 --> 00:23:22,445
-It's a work of art.
-Exactly.

473
00:23:22,512 --> 00:23:25,148
I thought they hadn't added it.
I can taste it at the end.

474
00:23:25,215 --> 00:23:26,750
-There's a hint of spice.
-Yes.

475
00:23:27,784 --> 00:23:29,786
<i>There's a tiny bit of ground pepper.</i>

476
00:23:29,853 --> 00:23:31,955
<i>-You're right.</i>
<i>-It's tasty.</i>

477
00:23:34,491 --> 00:23:35,792
I'm loving this.

478
00:23:38,662 --> 00:23:41,932
It would be amazing to eat this
when it gets cold and windy.

479
00:23:41,998 --> 00:23:43,600
It's great at night, too.

480
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:45,635
It suits the vibes very well.

481
00:23:46,202 --> 00:23:48,772
And the kimchi dumplings
taste a bit stronger.

482
00:23:48,838 --> 00:23:52,809
-So, eat them after the meat dumplings.
-Got it.

483
00:23:52,876 --> 00:23:54,711
It tastes completely different.

484
00:23:54,778 --> 00:23:57,347
I like the kimchi ones a bit more.

485
00:23:58,215 --> 00:23:59,816
-Try some kimchi dumplings.
-Sure.

486
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:03,687
-How do you eat this one?
-Split it in half again.

487
00:24:03,753 --> 00:24:05,021
Okay.

488
00:24:05,622 --> 00:24:08,091
-This is also super tasty.
-It sure looks like it.

489
00:24:08,658 --> 00:24:11,861
But you can't say
this is a kimchi dumpling.

490
00:24:11,928 --> 00:24:14,130
There's a bunch of meat inside.

491
00:24:14,197 --> 00:24:16,466
I thought it was stir-fried spicy pork.

492
00:24:16,533 --> 00:24:18,068
PLENTY OF MEAT INSIDE

493
00:24:24,641 --> 00:24:26,476
YUM

494
00:24:27,978 --> 00:24:31,348
THE FOODIE BROTHERS
START DEVOURING THE DUMPLINGS

495
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:37,320
TOO BUSY EATING TO SPEAK

496
00:24:40,824 --> 00:24:42,859
-It's scrumptious.
-Right?

497
00:24:44,694 --> 00:24:47,764
-Dang, I can't get enough of this.
-Me too.

498
00:24:47,831 --> 00:24:50,600
David, I think they need
to change its name.

499
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:51,668
-To what?
-What?

500
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:54,571
"Meat kimchi dumpling."

501
00:24:54,638 --> 00:24:56,573
-There's so much meat.
-I agree.

502
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,909
<i>I get why you like this.</i>

503
00:24:58,975 --> 00:25:02,412
THE FILLING OF JUNGHUN'S FAVORITE
KIMCHI JUMBO DUMPLING

504
00:25:04,147 --> 00:25:06,216
THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE FROM OTHER PLACES

505
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:12,789
IS THE MEAT JUICE
THAT BLENDS WITH THE KIMCHI

506
00:25:14,591 --> 00:25:17,494
THE PERFECT BALANCE OF MEAT AND KIMCHI

507
00:25:17,561 --> 00:25:19,696
I personally don't like kimchi dumplings

508
00:25:19,763 --> 00:25:23,967
because my mom used to make them
whenever there was extra kimchi.

509
00:25:24,634 --> 00:25:27,437
She would always make them.

510
00:25:28,104 --> 00:25:31,141
-I had to eat them until I was sick of it.
-I see.

511
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:34,978
I don't usually eat them,
but these are really good.

512
00:25:35,045 --> 00:25:37,981
It doesn't taste like
other typical kimchi dumplings.

513
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,482
It tastes richer.

514
00:25:46,823 --> 00:25:51,528
So, I asked the owner
if he could make this without pork.

515
00:25:52,062 --> 00:25:54,564
-Did he say no?
-He says it doesn't taste the same.

516
00:25:54,631 --> 00:25:58,501
<i>The juice from the pork is a must</i>
<i>for it to taste like this.</i>

517
00:26:01,972 --> 00:26:03,106
It sure is tasty,

518
00:26:03,773 --> 00:26:07,777
but what I find interesting is
the texture of the dumpling wrapper.

519
00:26:07,844 --> 00:26:13,149
A dumpling wrapper isn't usually
this springy and chewy.

520
00:26:13,216 --> 00:26:14,351
But it's super chewy.

521
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:18,588
It's between a steamed bun
and a typical thin-skinned dumpling.

522
00:26:18,655 --> 00:26:21,091
-Exactly.
-It's nice and chewy.

523
00:26:25,695 --> 00:26:26,696
It's obvious.

524
00:26:27,797 --> 00:26:29,799
-You can tell it's handmade.
-Right.

525
00:26:30,367 --> 00:26:33,303
<i>-It's thin in some places…</i>
<i>-And thick in other parts.</i>

526
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:36,072
<i>-I love the different textures.</i>
<i>-Me too.</i>

527
00:26:36,139 --> 00:26:41,578
STARTS THE DAY BY MAKING THE DOUGH
FOR THE JUMBO DUMPLINGS

528
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,049
TAKES OFF PIECES OF DOUGH ONE BY ONE

529
00:26:46,616 --> 00:26:51,488
AND CAREFULLY MAKES THE DUMPLINGS

530
00:26:55,258 --> 00:26:59,029
THE THICKNESS VARIES BECAUSE IT'S HANDMADE

531
00:26:59,663 --> 00:27:00,730
IT'S FUN TO EAT

532
00:27:00,797 --> 00:27:01,798
It's yummy.

533
00:27:04,167 --> 00:27:05,168
It's excellent.

534
00:27:06,303 --> 00:27:07,971
I should take it to go.

535
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:10,073
It's better after it cools down.

536
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:14,311
It's the best dumplings I've ever had.
I'm obsessed.

537
00:27:14,377 --> 00:27:16,179
I absolutely love dumplings.

538
00:27:16,246 --> 00:27:19,916
I didn't have much money when I was young.

539
00:27:19,983 --> 00:27:22,752
I would ride my motorcycle
with my girlfriend.

540
00:27:22,819 --> 00:27:25,455
And there was a dumpling place
with steam pouring out.

541
00:27:26,323 --> 00:27:29,793
But I would only have
2,000 won in my pocket.

542
00:27:29,859 --> 00:27:31,261
I didn't have much money,

543
00:27:31,328 --> 00:27:36,733
so I would ride my motorcycle in the cold
and stop at the dumpling place.

544
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,803
I would buy one kimchi jumbo dumpling
and one steamed bun.

545
00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:41,671
It would be nice and warm.

546
00:27:43,073 --> 00:27:44,975
It's like a movie.

547
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:48,345
Sharing a dumpling
with your girlfriend on a cold day.

548
00:27:48,411 --> 00:27:50,380
But I hope she's his current wife.

549
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,948
She is my wife.

550
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:55,919
-What a relief.
-That's no fun.

551
00:27:55,986 --> 00:27:58,355
Tell us the truth.

552
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:03,159
-I want to stop eating, but I keep…
-You can't stop, right?

553
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,562
These are so addictive.

554
00:28:05,629 --> 00:28:09,799
I wasn't that thrilled when I heard
we were going to a dumpling place.

555
00:28:09,866 --> 00:28:11,568
"How good could dumplings be?"

556
00:28:11,635 --> 00:28:14,170
So, I thought it was
just a nostalgic place of his.

557
00:28:15,105 --> 00:28:16,740
Simply a long-standing place.

558
00:28:16,806 --> 00:28:18,475
-But it's unreal.
-It's incredible.

559
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:21,044
-Do you trust me now?
-Absolutely.

560
00:28:21,678 --> 00:28:24,180
When did you move to the US?

561
00:28:24,247 --> 00:28:27,717
-It's been over 20 years.
-You have been there a long time.

562
00:28:27,784 --> 00:28:32,188
What made you start
a <i>cupbap </i>business there?

563
00:28:32,255 --> 00:28:34,391
I saw a documentary by chance.

564
00:28:34,457 --> 00:28:36,893
It featured stores
selling <i>cupbap </i>in Noryangjin.

565
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,929
-Oh, at the <i>gosichon.</i>
-Right.

566
00:28:38,995 --> 00:28:40,964
It immediately gave me an idea.

567
00:28:41,031 --> 00:28:43,199
I thought it would be a hit in the US.

568
00:28:44,367 --> 00:28:47,837
It's simple, fun,
and easy to eat anywhere.

569
00:28:47,904 --> 00:28:50,340
I thought I should sell this overseas.

570
00:28:50,407 --> 00:28:52,876
Was it a success from the start?

571
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:54,844
I sold out on the first day,

572
00:28:54,911 --> 00:28:56,746
so I thought I had succeeded.

573
00:28:56,813 --> 00:29:01,851
But the next day, I went to a food truck
roundup where all the locals gather.

574
00:29:02,652 --> 00:29:04,788
But everyone ignored us.

575
00:29:04,854 --> 00:29:06,256
Oh, no.

576
00:29:06,323 --> 00:29:09,726
But it was before
PSY's "Gangnam Style" came out.

577
00:29:09,793 --> 00:29:13,096
I was deep in the countryside,
so no one had tried Korean food.

578
00:29:13,163 --> 00:29:16,132
It was a stranger's food
from an unfamiliar country.

579
00:29:16,199 --> 00:29:19,002
<i>I tried changing the sauce</i>
<i>that we drizzle on top.</i>

580
00:29:19,069 --> 00:29:23,406
<i>I made sauces</i>
<i>using only ingredients Americans enjoy</i>

581
00:29:23,473 --> 00:29:24,941
<i>and drizzled those on top.</i>

582
00:29:25,308 --> 00:29:27,377
It's an unfamiliar food at first,

583
00:29:27,444 --> 00:29:29,779
but they can still taste
what they're used to.

584
00:29:29,846 --> 00:29:31,581
When they keep eating,

585
00:29:31,648 --> 00:29:36,219
<i>there would be Korean toppings</i>
<i>like stir-fried spicy pork and bulgogi.</i>

586
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:41,291
<i>I tried to take an approach</i>
<i>that wouldn't put them off.</i>

587
00:29:41,925 --> 00:29:46,229
HIS BUSINESS TOOK OFF FROM THAT MOMENT

588
00:29:46,997 --> 00:29:47,998
That's awesome.

589
00:29:48,698 --> 00:29:53,003
We ordered a bunch of dumplings,
but I'm surprised we ate most of them.

590
00:29:53,069 --> 00:29:56,373
Honestly, I think I can eat a few more.

591
00:29:56,439 --> 00:29:57,440
I'm having more.

592
00:29:58,909 --> 00:30:01,144
Then what about the steamed buns?

593
00:30:01,811 --> 00:30:03,947
FORGOT ABOUT THE STEAMED BUNS FOR A SECOND

594
00:30:04,014 --> 00:30:05,715
-Shall I have one?
-Sure.

595
00:30:05,782 --> 00:30:06,783
-Oh, my.
-Is it hot?

596
00:30:07,717 --> 00:30:09,386
Should I also split this in half?

597
00:30:09,653 --> 00:30:11,788
-Of course.
-Got it.

598
00:30:11,855 --> 00:30:15,058
It looks like large steamed buns
from convenience stores.

599
00:30:19,563 --> 00:30:21,665
There's still steam coming out.

600
00:30:22,966 --> 00:30:24,367
-It's thick.
-Wow, it's good.

601
00:30:27,003 --> 00:30:30,507
The sweet red bean paste bun
is less sweet than convenience store buns.

602
00:30:30,574 --> 00:30:31,575
I agree.

603
00:30:31,641 --> 00:30:35,245
They're not overly sweet.
They didn't put too much sugar in them.

604
00:30:36,446 --> 00:30:38,915
It's the perfect ratio.

605
00:30:39,683 --> 00:30:41,484
I love the red bean aroma.

606
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,654
It isn't too much.

607
00:30:44,721 --> 00:30:50,093
If it's not properly cooked,
sometimes the red bean smells very strong.

608
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:55,565
But this tastes richer
than the steamed buns we normally eat.

609
00:30:55,632 --> 00:30:57,734
<i>-I agree.</i>
<i>-The red bean tastes great.</i>

610
00:30:57,801 --> 00:31:01,805
<i>It's neither too smooth nor is it chunky.</i>

611
00:31:01,871 --> 00:31:03,073
<i>It tastes different.</i>

612
00:31:03,707 --> 00:31:09,446
CLASSIC STEAMED BUNS
WITH A MARVELOUS FILLING

613
00:31:09,512 --> 00:31:12,182
This is the perfect dessert.

614
00:31:12,249 --> 00:31:15,352
-You should eat this at the end.
-It's too sweet at the start.

615
00:31:15,418 --> 00:31:18,088
You wrap it up with these steamed buns.

616
00:31:18,154 --> 00:31:19,356
One more thing.

617
00:31:20,323 --> 00:31:22,726
-The bun is insane.
-Exactly.

618
00:31:23,126 --> 00:31:25,295
I think they use the same dumping dough.

619
00:31:25,362 --> 00:31:27,330
So it stays chewy for a long time.

620
00:31:27,397 --> 00:31:31,234
I think you're right about the dough.

621
00:31:31,301 --> 00:31:32,969
It's a bit thicker.

622
00:31:33,036 --> 00:31:34,037
It's yummy.

623
00:31:35,071 --> 00:31:37,807
I can't stop eating this as well.
I'm in trouble.

624
00:31:38,775 --> 00:31:41,545
The texture is great,
and it smells amazing.

625
00:31:41,611 --> 00:31:44,781
How can it be this good?

626
00:31:44,848 --> 00:31:48,451
-Let's ask the owner about the food.
-That sounds great.

627
00:31:49,386 --> 00:31:50,787
Sir!

628
00:31:51,421 --> 00:31:52,656
He can't hear you.

629
00:31:52,722 --> 00:31:53,990
One, two, three.

630
00:31:54,057 --> 00:31:55,959
<i>-Sir!</i>
<i>-Sir!</i>

631
00:31:56,026 --> 00:31:58,828
<i>-You can't come here alone.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>

632
00:31:58,895 --> 00:32:00,130
CALLING THE OWNER OVER

633
00:32:01,197 --> 00:32:04,301
-Did you enjoy the food?
-Look at how much we ate.

634
00:32:04,367 --> 00:32:06,469
Oh, you sure ate a lot.

635
00:32:07,804 --> 00:32:11,608
-Let's ask about the dough.
-Are they made from the same dough?

636
00:32:11,675 --> 00:32:13,143
No, they aren't.

637
00:32:13,977 --> 00:32:16,746
We add butter to the dough
for the steamed buns.

638
00:32:16,813 --> 00:32:18,481
That's the only difference.

639
00:32:18,548 --> 00:32:20,951
That's why it tasted softer.

640
00:32:21,017 --> 00:32:25,188
Most of the employees have worked here
for over ten years.

641
00:32:27,757 --> 00:32:32,195
THE STAFF HAVE MADE DUMPLINGS
FOR A LONG TIME

642
00:32:33,063 --> 00:32:36,866
THEY HAVE GAINED KNOW-HOW
AND BUILT TRUST OVER THAT TIME

643
00:32:38,768 --> 00:32:41,972
THIS IS WHY THIS GO-TO SPOT
HAS BEEN LOVED BY MANY

644
00:32:42,038 --> 00:32:43,373
<i>Having tried their dishes,</i>

645
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,776
now I see why you love
this dumpling place.

646
00:32:46,843 --> 00:32:50,347
What does this go-to place mean to you?

647
00:32:50,413 --> 00:32:55,185
Dumplings are made
by mixing various ingredients.

648
00:32:55,252 --> 00:32:57,621
They all blend together and make it good.

649
00:32:57,687 --> 00:32:58,955
When I come to Namdaemun,

650
00:32:59,756 --> 00:33:04,661
it feels like people from different
countries come together here.

651
00:33:05,528 --> 00:33:08,632
A CULTURE OF OPEN-MINDEDNESS
AND ACCEPTANCE

652
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:13,003
<i>This is what makes Namdaemun so special.</i>

653
00:33:13,403 --> 00:33:18,508
<i>In a way, dumplings and Namdaemun</i>
<i>seem to share something in common.</i>

654
00:33:18,575 --> 00:33:21,378
A PLACE THAT FILLS YOU UP,
JUST LIKE EATING DUMPLINGS

655
00:33:22,045 --> 00:33:25,181
Seeing this, I realized
it's not just about taste.

656
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:28,952
This community really resonated with me.

657
00:33:30,787 --> 00:33:31,788
That was awesome.

658
00:33:31,855 --> 00:33:33,957
Thanks for introducing us
to this go-to place.

659
00:33:34,024 --> 00:33:37,160
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you.

660
00:33:44,968 --> 00:33:48,505
I prepared a small present
for all of you today.

661
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,775
-Did you publish a book?
-Yes.

662
00:33:51,841 --> 00:33:54,511
-This is for you, David.
-Wow, thank you.

663
00:33:54,578 --> 00:33:56,346
-For Chef Lim Taehoon.
-Thank you.

664
00:33:56,413 --> 00:33:58,882
-For Yoon Dujun.
-I'll enjoy reading this.

665
00:33:58,949 --> 00:34:00,784
He signed it in advance.

666
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,319
Wow, thank you.

667
00:34:02,385 --> 00:34:04,387
-Thank you for the book.
-You're welcome.

668
00:34:05,088 --> 00:34:07,924
-Try these steamed buns.
-They're scrumptious.

669
00:34:07,991 --> 00:34:10,360
I'll give each of you one. Here you go.

670
00:34:11,728 --> 00:34:12,796
They're still warm.

671
00:34:14,231 --> 00:34:15,398
Everyone gets one.

672
00:34:16,433 --> 00:34:17,500
Thanks for your work.

673
00:34:18,101 --> 00:34:20,136
Here you go.

674
00:34:22,939 --> 00:34:25,075
<i>-It was super fun.</i>
<i>-I had a great time.</i>
