CHANGSIN-DONG, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL

00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:12,779
DONGMYO IS A COZY PLACE
FILLED WITH OLD THINGS

4
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:16,049
THE SUN IS GRADUALLY SETTING

5
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:17,551
CHEF'S GO-TO

6
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:18,886
<i>Why are they so late?</i>

7
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:21,488
I'm hungry.

8
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,991
NAMNO IS WAITING IN AN OLD-STYLE BAR

9
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:25,993
Was the menu always this long?

10
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:31,331
There's our sign, "Chef's Go-To."

11
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,901
DUJUN WALKS WITH ANTICIPATION

12
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,304
-Hello, Namno.
-Hi, there.

13
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,540
THEY HAPPILY GREET EACH OTHER

14
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:41,575
There it is. "Donggang Bar."

15
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:43,043
It's a bar.

16
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,244
-Let's go in.
-Sure.

17
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:45,746
MINSEONG AND TAEHOON ARRIVE

18
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:47,648
-They're here.
-Hello.

19
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,716
-Hey, Namno and Dujun.
-Hello.

20
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,652
-Where are we at?
-Gosh, so loud.

21
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:52,986
-Donggang.
-Are we too loud?

22
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,922
THE BAR FILLS WITH CHATTER

23
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:59,426
-Wait, David isn't here yet.
-He's coming.

24
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:00,494
He's on his way.

25
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,462
We don't have a guest for the first time.

26
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,598
-That's right.
-Tell us about this place.

27
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,233
I love the vibe.

28
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,268
It's a secret place of mine.

29
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:09,903
I didn't want to reveal it.

30
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:12,239
-Hello!
-He's here.

31
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:14,775
-Welcome.
-Everyone is finally here.

32
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:16,743
-The last one is here.
-We're all here.

33
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,545
-He's the star.
-He's today's guest.

34
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:21,648
Welcome, Chef David Lee.

35
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:25,686
Wow, it's the first time
we've all gotten together.

36
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,487
This is the last episode.

37
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:29,256
-I'm sad it's over.
-Me too.

38
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:32,693
Did we shoot for three to four months?

39
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,862
<i>We started in August.</i>

40
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,564
<i>-Almost half a year has passed.</i>
<i>-Has it been that long?</i>

41
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:42,169
THEY FILMED TOGETHER
FOR NEARLY HALF A YEAR

42
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:46,173
-It was like a monthly get-together.
-Exactly.

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,742
-I'm sad that this is the end.
-Same.

44
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,746
This is Namno's go-to place.

45
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:56,650
We will be dining at superstar Namno's
go-to spot for our last episode.

46
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,785
-He invited us here.
-Namno is a big foodie.

47
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:03,724
I noticed that we had to take
our shoes off at the entrance.

48
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,226
-It means the food is great.
-Really?

49
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,629
-Why is that?
-Because it's been here long.

50
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:11,365
-It's been running for a long time.
-Exactly.

51
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:14,301
It's a reliable spot
since it's been around for so long.

52
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:16,470
I thought that while taking my shoes off.

53
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:19,306
It's a comfortable spot
to enjoy some drinks.

54
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:22,409
-It's a relaxing place.
-It's good for your circulation.

55
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:25,345
I came here by chance.

56
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:28,515
One day, I had a craving
for braised dishes and stew.

57
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:31,885
-But I didn't want to go to a franchise.
-I know that feeling.

58
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:34,955
I kept searching online
and ended up at Dongmyo.

59
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:38,425
-You know Dongmyo has insane vibes.
-Absolutely.

60
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,961
So I came here and ordered food.

61
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:44,565
I was purely shocked at first
because it was so good.

62
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,801
It was absolutely amazing.
I could eat food and drink.

63
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:50,504
Stumbling upon a great place
is an awesome feeling.

64
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:53,841
After that, I came here very often
for work dinners.

65
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,976
-When did you first come here?
-Six years ago.

66
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:58,312
-Wow, really?
-Yes, it's been over five years.

67
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,413
That's a long time.

68
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,783
I like this place especially
because the food isn't fancy.

69
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,051
-It's simple.
-Right.

70
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:06,320
-I can't wait.
-Is this handwritten?

71
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:10,057
-It's a really long menu.
-She has beautiful handwriting.

72
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,492
THE MENU IS HANDWRITTEN NICELY

73
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,028
What shall we order?

74
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:16,864
-Should we let Namno order?
-Let's see.

75
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,700
-There are so many.
-I'll order a dish for Minseong.

76
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:22,603
-He's the Dragon King of Yeouido.
-Right.

77
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:25,606
Since he's crazy about the sea…

78
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,140
Aren't you tired of seafood?

79
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,176
-It's all right.
-Stop it.

80
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:31,645
I like seafood more than meat.

81
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,946
It's the truth.

82
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:35,349
-Let's first order horned turbans.
-Okay.

83
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,451
-And cuttlefish.
-They're both sweet.

84
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,620
Let's order braised <i>goni </i>and fish roe.

85
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,054
It's my absolute favorite.

86
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:42,689
I'm only eating <i>goni.</i>

87
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,960
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello.

88
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,695
Just look at her.

89
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,397
PARK CHASUN
OWNER OF DONGGANG BAR

90
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:53,200
-She's like a celebrity.
-She's so stylish.

91
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:55,602
-Thank you.
-I love your hair color.

92
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:58,805
-We must go to the same hair salon.
-Sure.

93
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,576
How long have you been running this place?

94
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:06,146
-I've been here for 25 years.
-Wow, and what about before that?

95
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:09,883
And I also worked at a place nearby
for about ten years.

96
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,818
-Over 30 years.
-Almost 35 years.

97
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,854
-It's been 35 years.
-Thank you.

98
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:17,491
It's impressive that she kept
this place running for so long.

99
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:19,927
Everyone in Dongmyo knows her.

100
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,095
-Really?
-She's famous for her cooking.

101
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,433
Are these the side dishes?

102
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:29,303
The side dishes are bar snacks.

103
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:32,139
Please give us some alcohol.
We need a drink with this tofu.

104
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:36,476
-Would you like soju?
-Yes, and two bottles of beer, please.

105
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:40,013
I think Dujun will really like
the side dishes here.

106
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,081
It's handmade tofu.

107
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:45,252
-You like light and clean dishes.
-I sure do.

108
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,154
<i>-Are these the side dishes?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

109
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:49,723
<i>-I've never seen bean sprouts piled up.</i>
<i>-Me neither.</i>

110
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,325
-Is it seasoned?
-Of course.

111
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:52,693
-Oh, really?
-Hold on.

112
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,229
Did you think she'd just serve
boiled bean sprouts?

113
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,465
-It doesn't look seasoned.
-It is though.

114
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,670
EVERYONE TAKES A BITE

115
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:05,072
YUM

116
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,773
-Isn't it tasty?
-It's yummy.

117
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,175
Wow, this is so good.

118
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:10,244
The bean sprouts are great on their own.

119
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,014
And the bean sprouts are great
with the tofu and sauce.

120
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:17,017
It's like an all-purpose sauce.

121
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:19,520
I think it will also go well with this.

122
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,054
TRYING IT TOGETHER

123
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,389
Add bean sprouts on top.

124
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:26,059
-I love the sauce.
-It's amazing.

125
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:28,228
Man, it's super soft.

126
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:30,898
The side dishes are how you know
the food is good.

127
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:33,367
-Experts can tell after trying just a few.
-Exactly.

128
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:37,070
-The side dishes are just my type.
-It's fantastic.

129
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:40,541
-Let me pour you a glass.
-Sure.

130
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:41,842
TIME FOR SOME DRINKS

131
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:44,278
-Thank you.
-Sommelier is my nickname.

132
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,146
I'm amazing at mixing soju and beer.

133
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:50,350
POURS IN A BIT OF SOJU FIRST

134
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,987
ADDS REFRESHING BEER

135
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,757
THE SOJUS AND BEER ARE READY

136
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:57,824
AMAZING

137
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:04,031
-He's pushing down the foam.
-I see.

138
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,933
Cheers.

139
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:08,068
-Cheers, everyone.
-Cheers!

140
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:09,636
To another season.

141
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,738
-Are we shooting season two?
-What?

142
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:14,474
-That's a secret.
-It will come true if you repeat it.

143
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,977
It's a secret
that Taehoon is out next season.

144
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,012
I'm okay, if only you guys…

145
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:21,915
He's completely flustered!

146
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:25,419
HOW CUTE, NAMNO

147
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:27,521
Whoa, it's here.

148
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:29,656
-Wow, what's that?
-It's cuttlefish.

149
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,526
Oh, it's sliced into thick pieces.

150
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:38,198
FRESH CUTTLEFISH

151
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:42,736
AND FRESH HORNED TURBAN

152
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:45,839
How much is all this?
I can't even serve this much.

153
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,542
-It's unbelievable.
-Look at that.

154
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:49,877
I have to take a picture.

155
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:51,712
The cuttlefish is incredible.

156
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,647
THE WHITE CUTTLEFISH LOOKS FRESH

157
00:06:54,715 --> 00:07:00,387
DIPS IT IN <i>CHOJANG</i>

158
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,556
How is it, Minseong?

159
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:04,157
-Let me try it.
-Can we dig in?

160
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:08,462
It's evenly cooked
like your bok choy, right?

161
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,200
You're right.

162
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,903
-Dang, this is good.
-It's insane.

163
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,107
The owner made this <i>chojang </i>herself.

164
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:21,441
-Really?
-Yes.

165
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,810
-Let me say something as an expert.
-Oh, right.

166
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:26,647
Store-bought <i>chojang</i>
is rarely made with vinegar.

167
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:29,783
It's always made with acetic acid.

168
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,518
It's in this humongous container.

169
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:32,853
TO MAKE A LOT AT A LOW COST

170
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,988
-And it's cheap.
-Produced at a low cost.

171
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,457
No matter how hard I try
to make it at a low cost,

172
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:42,029
it far exceeds the price of the store-
bought one if I make it with vinegar.

173
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:44,131
-If I make it myself.
-He's right.

174
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,934
<i>Try it. The sourness is unique.</i>

175
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,369
<i>It's a bit more watery.</i>

176
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,173
There's even horned turban innards.

177
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,308
The innards are a must.

178
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:57,845
<i>If they aren't fresh,</i>
<i>you might get a stomachache.</i>

179
00:07:57,911 --> 00:08:00,180
I heard she gets them from Guri herself.

180
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:03,650
-The fish market in Guri?
-Yes, she buys them there.

181
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,986
-She checks them herself.
-They're delicious.

182
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:10,357
FRESH HORNED TURBAN BOUGHT EVERY MORNING

183
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:13,827
COOKED JUST RIGHT IN BOILING WATER

184
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:17,431
REMOVES EACH ONE BY HAND

185
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:21,101
SLICES INTO BIG, HEARTY PIECES

186
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:26,273
A PLATE OF FRESH HORNED TURBAN
AND INNARDS ARE READY

187
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:29,977
-It goes well with this sauce.
-It's excellent.

188
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,746
I'm loving the innards.

189
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,782
Do you usually remove the innards?

190
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,085
-No, we eat it all.
-I see.

191
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:41,588
They're usually left it,
but they aren't always served.

192
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:45,025
Places that serve frozen ones
take the innards out.

193
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:47,427
-Because they go bad easily.
-I see.

194
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:51,298
And the frozen ones
aren't sliced into thick pieces.

195
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:54,001
They're thinly sliced
because they're tough.

196
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:56,103
Look at these thick pieces.

197
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,106
-The owner guarantees their tenderness.
-They're super soft.

198
00:08:59,173 --> 00:09:01,008
THEIR HORNED TURBAN IS NICE AND CHEWY

199
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,777
Oh, they're fresh.

200
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,580
That's why they're being served.

201
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,849
YOU'RE RIGHT

202
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,151
Are you just going to state the obvious?

203
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:14,555
-He only says, "They're amazing."
-Exactly.

204
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:18,458
He's all surprised,
but only says, "They're amazing."

205
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:21,762
It means that
the dishes are really amazing.

206
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:25,032
-That's all he can say.
-Thanks for having my back.

207
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,068
He'll look at Hallasan Mountain and say,

208
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:29,870
-"It's amazing."
-"It's amazing."

209
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:32,739
"Jeju Island and Hallasan Mountain
are amazing."

210
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,374
How is the <i>chojang?</i>

211
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:35,776
-It's amazing.
-Right?

212
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:39,279
STOP TEASING ME

213
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,581
It's amazing.

214
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,082
TAEHOON'S EXPRESSIONS
1. AMAZING

215
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:44,451
The leaf mustard kimchi is amazing.

216
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:45,619
The <i>chojang </i>is amazing.

217
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:46,854
-Really?
-Isn't it good?

218
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,156
-Hey, this is major.
-Is that so?

219
00:09:49,223 --> 00:09:51,191
TAEHOON'S EXPRESSIONS
2. STATES THE OBVIOUS

220
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,392
This is ramyeon itself.

221
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:54,261
The dumplings are amazing here.

222
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:56,530
TAEHOON'S EXPRESSIONS
3. DANG

223
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:57,598
Dang.

224
00:09:58,165 --> 00:09:59,166
Dang.

225
00:10:00,234 --> 00:10:03,136
OBVIOUSLY, EVERYONE KNOWS
IT MEANS "IT'S DELICIOUS"

226
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:05,873
-Can we please have some laver rolls?
-Sure.

227
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,441
-Laver rolls?
-What's that?

228
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:09,710
LAVER ROLLS

229
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,512
<i>Is it like Chungmu </i>gimbap?

230
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:16,149
DABS A BIT OF SEASONED SOY SAUCE
ON THE RICE AND LAVER

231
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,453
ROLLS IT NICELY INTO BITE-SIZED ROLLS

232
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:24,424
IT'S NICE AND SALTY

233
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:27,794
THEIR SIGNATURE LAVER ROLLS

234
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:28,929
Here is the sauce.

235
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:30,764
-Are these cucumbers?
-Yes.

236
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:33,033
-How do we eat them?
-Just dip it in <i>chojang.</i>

237
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,368
Got it.

238
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,103
ONLY REGULARS GET CUCUMBERS

239
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,273
Middle-aged men would come in
starving after work,

240
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:42,309
-but they'd skip the main dishes.
-They only order bar snacks.

241
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:46,346
-They don't bother.
-I told them not to trouble their wives

242
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:48,315
and to just eat this here.

243
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:52,986
So I kept on serving this dish,
and now I can't stop making it.

244
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,623
TRIES ONE

245
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,125
YUM

246
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:04,231
IT'S YUMMY

247
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:09,069
DUJUN TAKES A BITE RIGHT AWAY

248
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,772
It's delicious on its own.

249
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,943
It's like when we devoured rice
with soy sauce as kids.

250
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,211
When we wouldn't eat.

251
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:20,714
Right, we would watch TV
and not eat our meals.

252
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:23,450
It's like when our moms
would try to make us eat.

253
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:28,989
I heard that eating this with cucumbers
is popular on social media.

254
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:31,325
-Like this?
-Do we add this on top?

255
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,961
Cucumbers go into <i>gimbap,</i>
so it's nothing new.

256
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,863
-Dip it in.
-We should dip it in.

257
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,431
-In <i>chojang.</i>
-Why cuttlefish?

258
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:38,899
Just dip it in <i>chojang.</i>

259
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:41,301
DIPPING IT IN <i>CHOJANG</i>

260
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,537
Come on, try it. It's amazing.

261
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:46,907
Say, "It's amazing."

262
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:49,176
-This is delicious.
-It sure is.

263
00:11:49,243 --> 00:11:52,913
Eating plain rice with laver
is absolutely incredible.

264
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,448
You just need some soy sauce.

265
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:57,751
I need to try this again.

266
00:11:57,818 --> 00:11:59,887
TRYING IT AGAIN BECAUSE IT'S SO GOOD

267
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:01,989
IT'S YUMMY

268
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,325
He doesn't usually eat this much.
I guess you really like it.

269
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,660
Look at him.

270
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:08,962
-It's good.
-Really?

271
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:10,163
EATING MORE THAN USUAL

272
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:11,999
A new dish is here.

273
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,402
-Look.
-It's braised <i>goni </i>and fish roe.

274
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:17,371
Wow, it looks spicy.

275
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:18,772
It looks amazing.

276
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,909
It's braised <i>goni </i>and fish roe.

277
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:25,546
BRAISED <i>GONI </i>AND FISH ROE

ADDS PARBOILED <i>GONI, </i>COD ROE,
AND BEAN SPROUTS

THEIR SIGNATURE DISH,
BRAISED <i>GONI </i>AND FISH ROE

282
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:44,665
-Let's dig in.
-The <i>goni </i>looks super fresh.

283
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:53,073
TRYING A BIG PIECE OF <i>GONI</i>

284
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:57,544
-Wow, it's awesome.
-Oh, it's meaty.

285
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,880
It's like foie gras from the sea.

286
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:03,984
-I ordered this for you.
-Really?

287
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:06,887
First, I ordered parboiled seafood
for Minseong

288
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:09,122
-since he likes seafood.
-How thoughtful of you.

289
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:11,191
-And you like spicy food.
-Right.

290
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:13,460
That's why I ordered this.

291
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:21,034
THIS IS SCRUMPTIOUS

292
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:23,637
<i>-The </i>goni…
<i>-This is cod </i>goni.

293
00:13:23,704 --> 00:13:26,173
<i>-Is that so?</i>
<i>-Yes, it's cod </i>goni.

294
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,042
-Isn't pollack <i>goni </i>a bit smaller?
-Yes.

295
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:33,013
This is the stuff.

296
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:35,649
There's a big roe here.

297
00:13:35,716 --> 00:13:36,950
TRYING THE ROE THIS TIME

298
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:42,155
YUM

299
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:43,991
-Try the roe.
-It's spicy.

300
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:46,994
The roe pops like caviar in your mouth.

301
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,495
<i>-It pops.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>

302
00:13:48,562 --> 00:13:50,797
ROE BURSTS LIKE CAVIAR IN YOUR MOUTH

303
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:54,067
Right?

304
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:57,304
-It's not as spicy as it looks.
-I agree.

305
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:59,940
It's something Dujun will like.

306
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:02,476
-How do I put this? It's got a kick.
-Exactly.

307
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:04,144
The spiciness is…

308
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:06,647
This is the perfect level of spiciness.

309
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:09,383
IT'S PLEASANTLY SPICY

310
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:10,450
<i>It's tasty.</i>

00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:16,890
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

312
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,793
Now it's time for a dish for David.

313
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,764
Right, you ordered for everyone else.

314
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,866
Yes, and I liked the side dishes.

315
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:28,402
-I'll order a potato pancake.
-That's my favorite.

316
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,370
I told you I like pancakes.

317
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:32,539
-Because--
-I am so into pancakes.

318
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:33,841
HILARIOUS

319
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:36,510
Please give us a potato pancake.

320
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:38,045
Give me some "I am."

321
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,249
Shall we order something else as well?

322
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:44,718
Let's try something from today's special.

323
00:14:44,785 --> 00:14:46,153
-Shall we?
-Sure.

324
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,988
Ma'am, what's on special today?

325
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:50,791
I can serve you some grilled tonguefish.

326
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:53,927
-Should we get that?
-Grilled tonguefish?

327
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:55,429
-Would you like one?
-Yes.

328
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:56,530
Got it.

329
00:14:57,965 --> 00:15:00,033
It's been so long since I had tonguefish.

330
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,468
-It's good.
-It sure is.

331
00:15:01,535 --> 00:15:02,536
It's expensive.

332
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:09,376
Shall we talk about the 20 places
we have been to up until now?

333
00:15:09,443 --> 00:15:12,079
Is there a go-to spot you remember most?

334
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:14,014
-Of course.
-Please choose one.

335
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:18,852
-Let's start with Minseong.
-I think mine will be similar to Dujun's.

336
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,121
Because we just devoured the food there.

337
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:22,656
-I remember.
-Anae's place.

338
00:15:22,723 --> 00:15:25,459
-Anae's place with the set meal.
-Was it called that?

339
00:15:25,526 --> 00:15:26,627
-Hold on…
-Ahn Jae…

340
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:27,928
Was it Ahn Jae?

341
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:31,198
-Ahn Jae Korean Restaurant.
-Yes, that's the one.

342
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:33,267
CAN'T STOP LAUGHING, GLARES

343
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:36,870
-That place was great.
-Wait, hold it in.

344
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:37,971
Grab his spoon.

345
00:15:38,539 --> 00:15:40,674
-Oh, no.
-Wife's restaurant?

346
00:15:40,741 --> 00:15:42,376
The stir-fried summer squash…

347
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:47,147
-It was delicious.
-It was totally mind-blowing.

348
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:49,216
The owner gets the ingredients

349
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:52,119
from all over the country…

350
00:15:52,186 --> 00:15:53,520
THEIR SIDE DISHES STOOD OUT

351
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:55,556
<i>You can have refills.</i>

352
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,025
-Can you get unlimited refills?
-Definitely.

353
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:01,795
NICELY PREPARED MEAL
OF STONE POT RICE AND SIDE DISHES

354
00:16:01,862 --> 00:16:05,332
-How was the squash served?
-It was stir-fried summer squash.

355
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,967
The owner used <i>yukjeot</i>.

356
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:09,770
-It was seasoned with <i>yukjeot.</i>
-Right.

357
00:16:09,837 --> 00:16:12,706
There's this unique sweetness
coming from salted shrimp.

358
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:17,311
-Is it good?
-Oh, it just melts in my mouth.

359
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:18,879
UNBELIEVABLY TENDER

360
00:16:18,946 --> 00:16:20,447
It tastes incredible.

361
00:16:20,514 --> 00:16:23,550
We need more summer squash.
Take a generous portion.

362
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:26,119
-Yes, I'll get a lot.
-It tastes unbelievable.

363
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:28,288
This is the best side dish I've had today.

364
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:30,090
-The summer squash?
-Yes.

365
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31,358
I'm obsessed with it.

366
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:33,894
Honestly, we had seven to eight refills.

367
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:34,962
The sauces were nice.

368
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:37,197
One thing about that place is

369
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:40,901
that they put extra care
into their side dishes.

370
00:16:40,968 --> 00:16:43,003
It was a rediscovery of side dishes.

371
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,571
-How about Taehoon?
-And you?

372
00:16:44,638 --> 00:16:48,342
Me? That place in Jeonnong-dong.
What was the place called?

373
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:49,576
-Busan Store?
-Yes.

374
00:16:49,643 --> 00:16:51,378
-I remember.
-Busan Store.

375
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:54,014
-It's a corner store.
-They even have a waiting area.

376
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:55,082
There's a kitchen?

377
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:58,285
-Come on in.
-This is the place for round two.

378
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:02,189
-It used to be one, but now it's a diner.
-Really? This is incredible.

379
00:17:02,256 --> 00:17:04,057
THE AUNTIE HAS GREAT COOKING SKILLS

380
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:05,325
<i>It's like homemade </i>gimbap.

381
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:07,261
-Just like the ones our moms made.
-Right.

382
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,862
SERVED COMFORT FOOD

383
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:12,833
I get why you'd drink soju with <i>gimbap.</i>

384
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,234
-Let's have some fun.
-Cheers.

385
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:15,369
THE PERFECT MEAL

386
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:18,505
DANG, IT'S GOOD

387
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:20,707
The owner buys the meat for every order.

388
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:23,777
Right, they buy fresh beef
at the butcher's and prepare it.

389
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:28,248
The <i>yukhoe </i>had tons of pine nuts in it.
And it was perfectly seasoned.

390
00:17:32,753 --> 00:17:34,755
It's absolutely incredible.

391
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:38,592
-How about you, David?
-Me?

392
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:40,093
My favorite…

393
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,129
Everyone will know what it is.

394
00:17:42,196 --> 00:17:44,064
I was pleasantly shocked there.

395
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:46,233
-The pork belly?
-Geumho Meat Restaurant.

396
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,535
-Was it a meat restaurant?
-Yes.

397
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:50,270
It was in Samcheonpo.

398
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:53,974
<i>We are in Sacheon, Gyeongsangnam-do.</i>

399
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:57,511
<i>It used to be called Samcheonpo,</i>
<i>but it's Sacheon now.</i>

400
00:17:57,578 --> 00:18:00,113
<i>We came all this way.</i>
<i>Shouldn't we eat some seafood?</i>

401
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,749
<i>-I was expecting sashimi.</i>
<i>-Me too.</i>

402
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:06,253
Look at the meat.
He's cutting it right there.

403
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,656
<i>Cut it in half, score the meat,</i>
<i>and spread it like a butterfly.</i>

404
00:18:09,723 --> 00:18:12,092
<i>It has an incredible ratio</i>
<i>of fat-to-lean meat.</i>

405
00:18:14,695 --> 00:18:16,163
Wow, thank you.

406
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,501
I was surprised that
the way you slice it actually matters.

407
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,936
The shape of the meat was fantastic.

408
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:28,742
PATS HIS HEAD BECAUSE IT'S SO GOOD

409
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:31,778
-It's the best pork I've ever had.
-You think so?

410
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:33,480
Sir, can we get another?

411
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:34,615
One more, please.

412
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:36,149
One more plate, please.

413
00:18:36,717 --> 00:18:41,221
<i>-Uncle, how many servings have we had?</i>
<i>-You've had 36.</i>

414
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:44,992
I've been to a lot of good meat places,

415
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:48,395
but this is the first place
well-built all the way from the basics.

416
00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:52,466
I think I will visit again with my family.

417
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:54,368
-And for a work dinner.
-Great.

418
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:56,303
I want to show my employees.

419
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,105
-It's in Sacheon.
-"I'll buy you pork."

420
00:18:58,172 --> 00:18:59,573
"Where?" "It's in Sacheon."

421
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,209
-Hey, you could fly there.
-Isn't that workplace abuse?

422
00:19:02,276 --> 00:19:05,212
-But they want to go there.
-Really?

423
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:07,281
-Is it because I asked them?
-Probably.

424
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:08,682
We're really going to go.

425
00:19:08,749 --> 00:19:09,883
I promised them.

426
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,119
-Are they driving?
-No.

427
00:19:12,186 --> 00:19:13,353
TEASING DAVID NONSTOP

428
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:17,257
I was really curious,
so I really wanted to visit that place.

429
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:19,226
-You have to visit.
-I will.

430
00:19:19,293 --> 00:19:22,362
-I wanted to go there, too.
-Then let's go there together.

431
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:24,631
You will be taken aback.

432
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:28,202
Namno will break Heebab's record
if he eats there.

433
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:30,671
You will probably eat 25 servings alone.

434
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:33,006
-My favorite…
-It's Namno's turn.

435
00:19:33,073 --> 00:19:37,978
It was a very delicate ingredient for me.

436
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:40,514
The fried chicken from Yeongi Bar.

437
00:19:41,582 --> 00:19:43,550
-I haven't been there.
-It's near my house.

438
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:45,853
-Namno devoured the food there.
-Right.

439
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,890
-You can see the pressure fryer.
-Oh, is this a pressure fryer?

440
00:19:49,957 --> 00:19:52,893
<i>-Not many places use this.</i>
<i>-Classic chicken spots used this.</i>

441
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,864
<i>-Yes, it's the KFC way.</i>
<i>-She's still sticking to that method.</i>

442
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:02,102
OLD-FASHIONED DEEP-FRIED CHICKEN

443
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:07,808
NAMNO ATE

444
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,343
AND ATE

445
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:11,245
AND ATE A LOT MORE

446
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:15,249
HIS HANDS AND MOUTH WERE BUSY

447
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:19,052
Namno is really killing it today.

448
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:21,088
I've never seen him like this on the show.

449
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:22,723
Really? I'm glad to hear that.

450
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:24,424
It's so delicious.

451
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:27,294
If you stop talking, it means it's good.

452
00:20:30,097 --> 00:20:32,966
I want to visit again,
but I want to eat by myself.

453
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:34,034
-By yourself?
-Yes.

454
00:20:34,101 --> 00:20:37,704
I want to eat the chicken
slowly in solitude.

455
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:39,706
And drink a lot.

456
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:42,276
-But it's hard to eat slowly there.
-I know.

457
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:44,611
-In my perspective…
-You'll eat like crazy.

458
00:20:44,678 --> 00:20:48,015
-You will dig in right away.
-I won't eat slowly like this.

459
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:51,552
I want to order three chickens
separately at my own pace.

460
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:55,255
So it doesn't get soggy.
That's what I mean by "slow."

461
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:57,958
-Dujun went to every go-to spot.
-Yes, I did.

462
00:20:58,025 --> 00:21:00,227
-What was your favorite?
-Let's see…

463
00:21:00,294 --> 00:21:03,430
-I wonder what--
-I'm curious since he went to all of them.

464
00:21:03,497 --> 00:21:04,731
I'm also curious.

465
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:07,301
I loved Saekguksi,
the one in front of my agency.

466
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:09,036
-That place was insane.
-Exactly.

467
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:13,273
I didn't know it was just ten meters down
the street from my agency.

468
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,441
Right around the corner.

469
00:21:14,508 --> 00:21:17,678
-That's my company.
-It's nice.

470
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:20,747
<i>It's right across from this building.</i>

471
00:21:20,814 --> 00:21:22,649
<i>-It just takes ten seconds.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>

472
00:21:23,417 --> 00:21:25,986
The seasonal seafood was excellent.

473
00:21:26,053 --> 00:21:28,121
And what was that side dish called?

474
00:21:28,188 --> 00:21:29,189
-<i>Pulchi.</i>
-Right.

475
00:21:29,256 --> 00:21:31,325
I couldn't stop eating that.

476
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:33,393
STIR-FRIED <i>PULCHI </i>WAS UNBELIEVABLY GOOD

477
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,568
CAN'T HELP BUT LAUGH

478
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:43,170
It's incredible.

479
00:21:44,204 --> 00:21:47,040
I loved the parboiled octopus
and braised pomfret.

480
00:21:47,107 --> 00:21:50,210
-And the mountain yam pancake.
-Yes, it was awesome.

481
00:21:50,277 --> 00:21:51,578
-I loved that.
-Me too.

482
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:53,113
-Really?
-It's scrumptious.

483
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,349
-It tastes like cheese.
-Exactly.

484
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:57,518
IT HAD A CHEESY FLAVOR

485
00:21:57,584 --> 00:21:59,319
We ate it all. Let's order one more.

486
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:01,588
We've never ordered refills of every dish.

487
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:03,023
I can't get enough of this.

488
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,391
FIRST TIME GETTING REFILLS

489
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:08,262
-I couldn't believe it was mountain yam.
-We had two.

490
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:09,630
-We had two servings.
-Yes.

491
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:11,265
Here is the potato pancake.

492
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:12,432
THE NEXT DISH IS READY

493
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:13,667
-Let's move this.
-Okay.

494
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:15,369
POTATO PANCAKE

495
00:22:15,435 --> 00:22:17,604
-It's shredded potatoes.
-Here is the sauce.

496
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:18,972
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

497
00:22:20,307 --> 00:22:23,610
CUTS THE POTATOES INTO THIN STRIPS

498
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:27,281
THOROUGHLY COATS THEM IN BATTER MIX

499
00:22:28,382 --> 00:22:31,785
FRIES IN BOILING OIL

500
00:22:32,586 --> 00:22:36,089
FRIES BOTH SIDES UNTIL GOLDEN BROWN

501
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,593
GOLDEN BROWN POTATO PANCAKE IS READY

502
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,661
Help yourselves.

503
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:42,029
LET'S DIG IN

504
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:44,731
-Let's try it.
-It's often made with grated potatoes.

505
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:46,500
This is made with julienned potatoes.

506
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:52,172
CRISPY

507
00:22:53,073 --> 00:22:54,842
Ma'am, it's super crunchy.

508
00:22:54,908 --> 00:22:56,109
Wow, it's so good.

509
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,615
It's like hash browns.

510
00:23:01,682 --> 00:23:04,718
How is this so crispy
with shredded potatoes?

511
00:23:04,785 --> 00:23:06,753
UNBELIEVABLY CRISPY

512
00:23:08,589 --> 00:23:11,391
-It's very nice.
-Kids would love this, too.

513
00:23:12,426 --> 00:23:14,862
CAN'T HELP BUT HUM AT HOW TASTY IT IS

514
00:23:14,928 --> 00:23:16,063
It's insane.

515
00:23:17,865 --> 00:23:19,967
Wow, it's delicious.

516
00:23:20,033 --> 00:23:21,068
DUNKS IT IN KETCHUP

517
00:23:21,134 --> 00:23:22,703
-It's covered.
-This is it.

518
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:25,706
EATS IT IN ONE BITE

519
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,209
-Why am I the only one eating?
-I ate a lot.

520
00:23:29,276 --> 00:23:30,277
Help yourself.

521
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:32,513
Is this your last meal? Why are you…

522
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:33,981
That's hilarious.

523
00:23:35,115 --> 00:23:37,618
Are you okay? You can't stop eating.

524
00:23:37,684 --> 00:23:40,320
HIS LOVE FOR POTATO PANCAKES
CAUSES A MISUNDERSTANDING

525
00:23:40,621 --> 00:23:42,389
-It's here.
-What did we order?

526
00:23:42,456 --> 00:23:44,258
-Grilled tonguefish.
-Right.

527
00:23:44,324 --> 00:23:46,693
<i>-This is tonguefish.</i>
<i>-Look how meaty it is.</i>

528
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,228
GRILLED TONGUEFISH IS HERE

529
00:23:49,296 --> 00:23:53,767
MOUTHWATERING VISUALS

530
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,639
<i>-Thank you.</i>
<i>-They're so big.</i>

531
00:23:58,705 --> 00:24:00,941
Shall I debone them?
Can you pass me a new spoon?

532
00:24:01,008 --> 00:24:02,543
Eat it with your hands.

533
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:04,444
Go ahead. I'll debone it for the others.

534
00:24:04,511 --> 00:24:06,580
-Okay, then.
-Sure, take one.

535
00:24:06,647 --> 00:24:08,682
I'll eat it straight from the bone.

536
00:24:08,749 --> 00:24:10,117
Gosh, that's the best part.

537
00:24:11,485 --> 00:24:13,620
What's wrong? You told me to eat it.

538
00:24:13,687 --> 00:24:15,455
-Let him take it.
-Wait…

539
00:24:15,522 --> 00:24:18,559
He's dying to eat it, okay?

540
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,694
He's practically starving.

541
00:24:20,761 --> 00:24:22,129
Is this your last meal?

542
00:24:22,196 --> 00:24:23,597
LOOKS LIKE HE'S STARVING

543
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:27,968
The bones are very thick.

544
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:30,070
I love the sides.

545
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:31,872
-The sides are great.
-Definitely.

546
00:24:32,406 --> 00:24:34,174
-The sides…
-Right.

547
00:24:34,241 --> 00:24:36,009
EATING BIG MOUTHFULS

548
00:24:36,076 --> 00:24:37,077
YUM

549
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:39,546
I thought I heard dolphins.

550
00:24:39,613 --> 00:24:40,848
TWO DOLPHINS HERE

551
00:24:42,216 --> 00:24:44,384
It's super nutty.

552
00:24:44,451 --> 00:24:47,921
NAMNO DEBONES IT FOR THEM

553
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:52,926
TAKING A BIG BITE

554
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:54,328
It tastes excellent.

555
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,031
This is really good.

556
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,504
-It's fresh.
-Yes, it's like eating by the seaside.

557
00:25:05,072 --> 00:25:07,808
ENJOYING BIG SPOONFULS
OF GRILLED TONGUEFISH

558
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:08,876
It's very creamy.

559
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,813
TASTES LIKE HEAVEN

560
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,749
Man, Taehoon is killing it today.

561
00:25:15,816 --> 00:25:18,085
HE DEVOURS THE GRILLED TONGUEFISH

562
00:25:18,151 --> 00:25:20,420
-The last time he ate like this…
-He's all in.

563
00:25:20,487 --> 00:25:22,823
…was when we had
grilled mackerel with Fabri.

564
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:28,028
<i>A set meal with stir-fried spicy pork</i>
<i>and with grilled fish.</i>

565
00:25:32,432 --> 00:25:35,135
-Wow, the mackerel is amazing.
-Really?

566
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:36,637
HE WAS OBSESSED WITH IT

567
00:25:37,304 --> 00:25:40,474
HE ATE IT STRAIGHT FROM THE BONE

568
00:25:40,908 --> 00:25:41,909
Help yourself.

569
00:25:42,576 --> 00:25:44,144
We're gobbling this up.

570
00:25:45,312 --> 00:25:47,481
FORGOT TO BREATHE WHILE CHOWING DOWN

571
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:48,749
Breathe.

572
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:50,584
Look at him.

573
00:25:50,651 --> 00:25:52,019
Can I order another mackerel?

574
00:25:52,686 --> 00:25:53,854
-Is it possible?
-Yes.

575
00:25:53,921 --> 00:25:57,858
Ma'am, can we please have
two more mackerel?

576
00:25:58,792 --> 00:26:00,360
You know how to eat that.

577
00:26:00,427 --> 00:26:02,696
-This is how you eat fish.
-He's like a cat.

578
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,231
That's hilarious.

579
00:26:04,298 --> 00:26:06,667
CHEF TAEHOON MIGHT BE A CAT

580
00:26:07,367 --> 00:26:11,271
-When I had the mackerel…
-Do you even remember that night?

581
00:26:11,338 --> 00:26:13,607
-He even stopped talking.
-That's right.

582
00:26:13,674 --> 00:26:15,576
You guys are like that sometimes.

583
00:26:15,642 --> 00:26:17,611
You get super immersed in the food.

584
00:26:17,678 --> 00:26:19,446
Do you have any favorite dishes?

585
00:26:19,513 --> 00:26:22,549
-Yes, I have some.
-I loved the deep-fried flounder.

586
00:26:23,517 --> 00:26:24,751
-I remember!
-The fish.

587
00:26:24,818 --> 00:26:26,420
-That bar.
-You and I Bar.

588
00:26:26,486 --> 00:26:28,222
-That's the one.
-In Mangwon-dong.

589
00:26:28,288 --> 00:26:29,823
Man, I was taken aback.

590
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,391
-You were like that.
-What?

591
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:33,694
You were quietly devouring the food there.

592
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,696
-I was out of my mind.
-Exactly.

593
00:26:37,364 --> 00:26:38,365
It's here.

594
00:26:39,366 --> 00:26:42,102
SHOCKED BY THE VISUALS

595
00:26:42,169 --> 00:26:44,204
I just saw it.

596
00:26:44,805 --> 00:26:46,173
SHOCKED WHEN SHE DEBONED IT

597
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,909
-Oh, my goodness.
-She pulls it apart with her hands.

598
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:53,914
YOU HAVE TO EAT IT WITH YOUR BARE HANDS

599
00:26:54,882 --> 00:26:57,184
-He eats well.
-That's tasty.

600
00:26:57,251 --> 00:26:58,719
That's hilarious.

601
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:01,054
-Fish heads are the best.
-Really?

602
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:03,490
I didn't think I'd eat so much. I love it.

603
00:27:03,557 --> 00:27:06,326
-I'll eat the last piece.
-This was so good.

604
00:27:06,393 --> 00:27:08,629
It's not the last.
There's still some left.

605
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:15,502
NAMNO DID NOT LEAVE A SINGLE CRUMB

606
00:27:17,704 --> 00:27:18,805
It was insane.

607
00:27:18,872 --> 00:27:23,477
I mean, it was so good
that I felt like I was out of this world.

608
00:27:23,544 --> 00:27:27,181
I wasn't just immersed.
My eyes popped out of my head.

609
00:27:27,247 --> 00:27:30,083
Namno ate like crazy,
more than anyone else.

610
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,318
I agree.

611
00:27:31,385 --> 00:27:33,220
GETS COMPLETELY SWEPT AWAY BY GOOD FOOD

612
00:27:34,021 --> 00:27:35,689
Has anyone visited the spots again?

613
00:27:35,756 --> 00:27:36,957
-I did.
-Where?

614
00:27:37,024 --> 00:27:38,125
Dangsan Hall.

615
00:27:38,192 --> 00:27:39,860
-The <i>gopchang </i>place.
-Right.

616
00:27:39,927 --> 00:27:43,430
-I went there six times after that.
-That's a lot.

617
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:44,731
-Seriously?
-Yes.

618
00:27:45,866 --> 00:27:48,735
<i>-It looks amazing.</i>
<i>-Looks incredible.</i>

619
00:27:48,802 --> 00:27:51,038
THE KOREAN BEEF <i>GOPCHANG</i>
WAS ON ANOTHER LEVEL

620
00:27:51,572 --> 00:27:53,607
<i>The fats taste amazing.</i>

621
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:55,375
<i>It's rich in fat.</i>

622
00:27:57,344 --> 00:28:04,051
BURSTING WITH RICHNESS

623
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:09,323
<i>Grill it nice and crisp until it's</i>
<i>crispy outside and juicy inside.</i>

624
00:28:09,957 --> 00:28:11,758
<i>-Try the brisket.</i>
<i>-Go ahead.</i>

625
00:28:12,326 --> 00:28:13,694
<i>It looks awesome.</i>

626
00:28:15,162 --> 00:28:17,598
UNBELIEVABLY TENDER

627
00:28:18,265 --> 00:28:20,100
-It's so soft.
-But wait.

628
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:21,502
These two are different.

629
00:28:21,568 --> 00:28:23,704
This is usually very hard and chewy.

630
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:27,140
It's usually tough,
but this one is nice and chewy.

631
00:28:28,308 --> 00:28:32,246
I visited that restaurant again
with Heebab.

632
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:35,249
-Who paid for the meal?
-I did…

633
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:39,686
But she didn't eat as much as I thought.

634
00:28:39,753 --> 00:28:41,388
She could've eaten more.

635
00:28:41,455 --> 00:28:45,125
Heebab loosened her belt,
and a couple of us went there to eat.

636
00:28:45,192 --> 00:28:46,660
And I paid about 900,000 won.

637
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:48,228
-Just for <i>gopchang?</i>
-Yes.

638
00:28:48,295 --> 00:28:50,163
We ate about 18 meters of it.

639
00:28:51,031 --> 00:28:53,667
But it wasn't just any <i>gopchang.</i>
It was super thick.

640
00:28:53,734 --> 00:28:55,602
THEY LOOK BACK ON FOND MEMORIES

641
00:28:56,904 --> 00:29:01,008
LAUGHING AND CHATTING TOGETHER

642
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:04,778
AS THE NIGHT GOES ON

643
00:29:04,845 --> 00:29:09,283
<i>Come to think of it, it must feel like</i>
<i>you guys finished a very long project.</i>

644
00:29:09,349 --> 00:29:10,484
<i>Half a year went by.</i>

645
00:29:10,551 --> 00:29:13,487
Our journey comes to an end
with today's episode.

646
00:29:13,554 --> 00:29:14,555
It was…

647
00:29:16,123 --> 00:29:20,861
super fun for me
to discover hidden restaurants.

648
00:29:22,696 --> 00:29:24,698
I liked that we visited them together.

649
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:28,602
We're all such different people,
but at some point…

650
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,205
I grew attached to everyone.

651
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:35,642
Honestly, I think I made
truly unforgettable memories

652
00:29:35,709 --> 00:29:37,544
because I love food so much.

653
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:39,713
I still have so many places to share.

654
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,715
-I bet you do.
-Absolutely.

655
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:46,353
I traveled to 18 countries
in search of new dishes.

656
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,288
I would love to introduce overseas spots.

657
00:29:48,355 --> 00:29:51,058
Especially since I lived in Japan
for ten years,

658
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:53,093
I know spots Koreans have never been to.

659
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,530
I have tons of old-school eateries
and other restaurants to share.

660
00:29:56,597 --> 00:29:59,199
There are still places
in Korea to introduce.

661
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:00,367
That's amazing.

662
00:30:00,434 --> 00:30:02,569
Honestly, I still have loads of places.

663
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:05,739
From the start,

664
00:30:06,406 --> 00:30:12,379
visiting these go-to spots felt like
meeting the guests' old friends.

665
00:30:12,446 --> 00:30:15,782
It was like being introduced to a friend,

666
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:18,719
so it was always heartwarming.

667
00:30:19,286 --> 00:30:22,189
It felt good to have more friends
by my side.

668
00:30:23,023 --> 00:30:24,324
That's how I feel.

669
00:30:24,391 --> 00:30:25,425
WARM AND COMFORTING

670
00:30:25,826 --> 00:30:29,296
I went to many go-to spots of other chefs.

671
00:30:29,363 --> 00:30:36,170
And as I visited those places,
I discovered more about the owners' lives.

672
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:39,873
You can get a glimpse into their lives.

673
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,675
-Right.
-They have a long history.

674
00:30:41,742 --> 00:30:44,578
-They all have unique stories.
-The food carries it.

675
00:30:44,645 --> 00:30:48,348
Each of their unique dishes tells a story.

676
00:30:48,415 --> 00:30:52,853
I felt a mix of emotions
as I tried those dishes.

677
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:57,191
-It's like stepping into their memories.
-Exactly.

678
00:30:57,257 --> 00:30:59,326
I experienced lots of things

679
00:31:00,727 --> 00:31:03,330
while I visited the 20 go-to spots.

680
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:11,438
I have been on tons
of food-related shows over the years.

681
00:31:11,505 --> 00:31:14,508
But the food on this show was the best.

682
00:31:14,575 --> 00:31:17,611
This show was very meaningful to me.

683
00:31:17,678 --> 00:31:21,281
Actually, I was very nervous at first

684
00:31:21,348 --> 00:31:24,618
to go on this journey with four chefs.

685
00:31:24,685 --> 00:31:27,120
-We were also worried about you.
-I know.

686
00:31:27,187 --> 00:31:29,423
I wondered if I could fit in.

687
00:31:29,823 --> 00:31:33,026
But everyone was super fun and caring.

688
00:31:33,093 --> 00:31:35,229
I had such a great time. Thank you.

689
00:31:36,663 --> 00:31:39,066
If there's another season,

690
00:31:39,132 --> 00:31:42,102
and if we all get to do it together…

691
00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:45,239
Risk your fee and invite
Lim Youngwoong on this show.

692
00:31:45,973 --> 00:31:47,307
-Sounds great.
-Youngwoong?

693
00:31:47,374 --> 00:31:49,009
-Yes.
-Look at him.

694
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:52,980
-He called him by his first name.
-He just casually calls him that.

695
00:31:53,046 --> 00:31:55,516
Honestly, I want to invite Sungjae.

696
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:59,419
-Who?
-I want to invite Chef Anh Sungjae.

697
00:31:59,486 --> 00:32:01,822
I heard he doesn't like you that much.

698
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:03,290
HOLD ON…

699
00:32:03,357 --> 00:32:05,325
He's flustered. I love that face.

700
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:08,929
I'll do my best,
even though they're very busy.

701
00:32:08,996 --> 00:32:12,299
-I'll ask Youngwoong.
-He said he would.

702
00:32:12,366 --> 00:32:14,835
-Don't cut this out.
-There's no need.

703
00:32:14,902 --> 00:32:16,603
-In season 2…
-I'll repeat it 5 times.

704
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,906
-Youngwoong!
-Youngwoong!

705
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:22,276
YOUNGWOONG, YOU WILL HELP ME OUT, RIGHT?

706
00:32:22,342 --> 00:32:23,844
Let's fill our glasses.

707
00:32:23,911 --> 00:32:27,214
Let's make a toast
and say goodbye to Chef's Go-To.

708
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:29,283
Well done, everyone.

709
00:32:29,349 --> 00:32:31,084
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

710
00:32:31,151 --> 00:32:32,386

Wow, what's that?

FEELING SHY

718
00:32:48,936 --> 00:32:51,004
Oh, you didn't have to.

719
00:32:52,105 --> 00:32:54,241
-Is season two…
-Let's take a picture.

720
00:32:55,943 --> 00:32:57,611
Send the picture to me.
