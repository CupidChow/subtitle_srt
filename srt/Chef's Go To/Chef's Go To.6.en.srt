00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:03,403
FOODIE BROTHERS: THE FOURTH, YOON DUJUN

2
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:06,173
THE ELDEST, KIM MINSEONG

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,909
THE SECOND, DAVID LEE

4
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:10,143
Minseong, where are we?

5
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:14,414
-We are in Sacheon, Gyeongsangnam-do.
-Sacheon?

6
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:18,252
<i>It used to be called Samcheonpo,</i>
<i>but it's Sacheon now.</i>

7
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:20,153
<i>-Did they change the name?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,221
THEY'RE IN SACHEON

9
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:26,193
WELCOME TO SACHEON

10
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:30,697
DEAR DRAGON KING, INTRODUCE US TO SACHEON

11
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:34,401
First of all, this city is my hometown.

12
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:36,336
Honestly, isn't it nice?

13
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:42,009
This is Korea's first cable car to connect
the mountain, the islands, and the sea.

14
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,945
THE FIRST CABLE CAR
LINKING MOUNTAIN, SEA, AND ISLANDS

15
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:49,049
<i>These are connecting bridges, where one is</i>
<i>cable-stayed, and the other is an arch.</i>

16
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:50,984
<i>They link the two islands.</i>

17
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,987
SAMCHEONPO BRIDGE AND CHOYANG BRIDGE

18
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:56,623
<i>It's at the center of Hallyeosudo,</i>

19
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,594
<i>and offers different types of seafood</i>
<i>depending on the season.</i>

20
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:02,329
<i>There must be different fish.</i>

21
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,298
PLENTY OF SEASONAL SEAFOOD ALL YEAR ROUND

22
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:05,866
I see you did your homework.

23
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:09,636
-He's the regional ambassador!
-I am Sacheon's regional ambassador.

24
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:14,641
WAY TO GO, SACHEON AMBASSADOR, MINSEONG!

25
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:20,380
We came all the way here.
So, who's the chef that called us here?

26
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:25,085
There's a high possibility that
it's Chef Minseong's hometown friend.

27
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:29,489
SO WHO IS IT?

28
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:32,693
Who else but me?

29
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,861
HE'S TODAY'S GUEST CHEF

30
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:38,432
I know an amazing spot with great food,
so I just had to share it.

31
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:40,634
-Are you today's chef, then?
-Of course.

32
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:42,970
-Do we have a guest, too?
-A guest?

33
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:45,272
I brought someone with a big appetite.

34
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:47,941
-Someone who eats a lot?
-Don't worry.

35
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:51,144
This person can boost
the local economy by eating.

36
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,347
-Do they eat that much?
-Yes.

37
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:56,550
When this person dines at a restaurant,
the day's revenue soars.

38
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,820
-They're capable of that.
-Why don't they come to mine?

39
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:02,789
They might've gone before.

40
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,592
Chef!

41
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,761
-Someone is calling us.
-I hear it, too.

42
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,097
Hello!

43
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:12,833
There's a camera onboard.

44
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,934
Chef!

45
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:15,102
WHO IS TODAY'S GUEST?

46
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:16,370
Who is it?

47
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,472
-Let's wave at her.
-We should greet her.

48
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:19,540
Who are you?

49
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,511
-I'm starving to death!
-It's Heebab!

50
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:25,746
I'm hungry!

51
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,050
-She says she's hungry.
-Let's go eat!

52
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:32,085
Turn the ship. Let's go right away!

53
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,255
He says to turn the ship. Let's go.

54
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,423
TODAY'S GUEST, HEEBAB

55
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:42,429
Thank you for the food. Let's finally eat.

56
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,065
SOUTH KOREA'S LEADING <i>MUKBANG </i>CREATOR

57
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:51,138
WIDELY RECOGNIZED
AS A BIG EATER AND FOODIE

58
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:55,209
SHE AND MINSEONG ARE GOOD FRIENDS

59
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:59,513
Hello, I'm Heebab, a <i>mukbang </i>creator.
Nice to meet you.

60
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:02,549
I can't open my eyes.

61
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:04,284
Are you close with Chef Minseong?

62
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:09,189
We are very close.
He has cooked for me many times.

63
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,625
I see. Nice to meet you.

64
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,094
-Have you been here before?
-Samcheonpo?

65
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:17,364
-I've been here about two times.
-Oh, that's a lot.

66
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:21,802
So, have you been to the place
that Minseong is taking us?

67
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:26,874
No, but he's a true foodie,
so I'm sure it's good.

68
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:30,310
HEEBAB CONFIRMS THAT HE IS A TRUE FOODIE

69
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,913
-I'm famished.
-Me too.

70
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,615
-Let's hurry.
-Let's go.

71
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:35,916
-Come on.
-Let's go.

72
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:38,018
-I've got it all prepared. Let's go.
-Great.

73
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:41,522
SPECIAL EPISODE 1
OF SACHEON, GYEONGSANGNAM-DO

74
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:45,225
LET'S GO TO THE FIRST GO-TO SPOT

75
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:51,265
-Minseong, we're in a residential area.
-The scenery changed.

76
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,734
-I can't see the ocean.
-It's gone.

77
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,303
A GO-TO SPOT IS HERE?

78
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,438
I don't see any restaurants here, though.

79
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:01,775
-That place is awesome.
-I suppose it's a local spot.

80
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:05,879
But I don't see any restaurants nearby.
There are no signs.

81
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:07,781
COMPLAINING DUE TO HUNGER

82
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:11,885
-We're almost there, Heejae. Just wait.
-Heebab is hungry.

83
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:13,820
She hasn't eaten.

84
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,590
END OF THE RESIDENTIAL AREA

85
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:18,058
WHERE IS HIS GO-TO SPOT?

86
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,493
Is this it?

87
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,929
-Yes, Geumho Meat Restaurant.
-Hold on.

88
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,297
Geumho Meat Restaurant.

89
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:26,300
It's so out of the blue,
with nothing else along the main road.

90
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,901
This sure is the place.

91
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:31,972
But we came all this way to Samcheonpo.
Shouldn't we eat some seafood?

92
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,741
-I was expecting sashimi.
-Me too.

93
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,677
-Let's head inside first.
-Let's go.

94
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,278
-It's the best.
-Let's go in.

95
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,249
-I love eating meat for breakfast.
-Heebab is excited.

96
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:43,684
-I love it, too.
-I love meat.

97
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:47,487
-Welcome.
-Hello.

98
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:49,756
-Hi.
-Look at this place.

99
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:52,659
-Welcome.
-You're so good-looking, sir.

100
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:56,563
TODAY'S GO-TO SPOT IS RUN
BY AN UNCLE, NOT AN AUNTIE

101
00:04:57,431 --> 00:05:00,601
IT'S NEAT AND COZY INSIDE

102
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:03,604
-They only have fresh pork here.
-That's it.

103
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,139
-Only one thing on the menu?
-They specialize in that.

104
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:08,275
DOMESTIC FRESH PORK

105
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:12,279
I myself specialize in meat dishes.
If only fresh pork is on the menu,

106
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:15,949
it means they're experienced.
He must be confident.

107
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:20,020
-How long have you been coming here?
-I've been coming here since my early 20s.

108
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:21,288
-Oh, my.
-Your early 20s?

109
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,891
My family's gravesite
is located just behind here.

110
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:26,126
We'd tidy up the gravesite
and come eat here.

111
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:27,661
HIS GO-TO SPOT IN HIS HOMETOWN

112
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:29,296
You've been coming here forever.

113
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:31,999
-Does that mean it's been 40 years?
-Stop it.

114
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,501
SENSITIVE ABOUT HIS AGE

115
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:39,006
HASN'T STOPPED COMING
TO HIS GO-TO SPOT SINCE HIS YOUTH

116
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:42,176
Heejae, I want to ask you something.

117
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,344
How much will you eat today?

118
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:46,547
-I don't eat if it's not good.
-I know that.

119
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:47,714
-Really?
-That's right.

120
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:51,385
-She's a big eater, but…
-She only eats good food.

121
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:56,423
After having my first bite,
I'll decide if I will devour it or not.

122
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,625
SHE'S GOURMET

123
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:01,094
-Should we order four servings?
-Okay.

124
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,296
-I'm hungry.
-Me too.

125
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,132
-Sir, may we have four servings?
-Of course.

126
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,936
HE SHARPENS HIS KNIFE
AS SOON AS HE GETS AN ORDER

127
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,306
AND TAKES OUT
A MASSIVE CHUNK OF FRESH PORK

128
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:15,609
Look at the meat.
He's cutting it right there.

129
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:21,248
So, will he serve us various meat cuts?

130
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:24,451
<i>He will serve us a plate of pork,</i>
<i>but it's just pork belly,</i>

131
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:27,688
<i>including the upper part of the pork neck.</i>

132
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,456
UPPER PART OF PORK NECK

133
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:35,863
WHOLE SLAB OF PORK BELLY WITH VARIOUS CUTS
INCLUDING PORK NECK AND RIB MEAT

134
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,164
We'll also get rib meat.

135
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:41,568
RIB MEAT ATTACHED TO THE WHOLE PORK BELLY

136
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,937
-He slices it thinly.
-It's like frozen pork belly.

137
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:46,373
-A bit thicker than frozen pork belly.
-I see.

138
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,709
-That's the perfect cut.
-Is that so?

139
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:52,246
It's old-fashioned.
They sliced it thinly back then.

140
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:54,181
THE CUT ENHANCES THE TASTE OF PORK BELLY

141
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:57,484
-That's a different meat cut.
-A different cut.

142
00:06:57,551 --> 00:07:00,721
-There's more fat here.
-Right, I think it's the hind leg.

143
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:06,326
In pork cuts, the meat just underneath
the rib bone tends to be quite fatty.

144
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,764
PORK BELLY NEAR THE THIGH IS RICH IN FAT

145
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:14,101
You have to throw this fat away
without hesitation.

146
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,008
Cut it in half, score it,
and spread it like a butterfly.

147
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:23,043
CUT THE FAT AT AN ANGLE

148
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,248
It has an incredible ratio
of fat-to-lean meat.

149
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,083
BALANCE BETWEEN PORK BELLY AND FAT

150
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:33,420
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE LEFTOVER FAT?

151
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:35,689
He throws away the leftover fat.

152
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,960
REMOVES THE FAT WITHOUT HESITATION

153
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,099
THROWS THE TRIMMED FAT AWAY

154
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,503
What is he doing? What technique is that?

155
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,206
He's making shallow cuts
so it doesn't curl up.

156
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:54,208
SCORING THE MEAT TO KEEP IT FROM SHRINKING

157
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:56,510
I've never seen such careful work.

158
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,979
Why is my mouth watering already?

159
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:01,215
-It's not even…
-Raw pork has never made

160
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:04,151
-my mouth water like this.
-Exactly, it's not even grilled yet.

161
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:10,190
-He plates it nicely like sashimi.
-Yes, he cuts it into pieces.

162
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:15,229
PLACING THE FRESH PORK
LIKE ASSORTED SASHIMI

163
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,066
That looks nice.

164
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:20,767
CAREFULLY ARRANGED PORK BELLY

165
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:26,073
Sir, did you use to work with fish
before running a barbecue restaurant?

166
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:27,674
-No.
-Really?

167
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:30,344
-It's like sashimi.
-It's nicely plated.

168
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,179
It's not easy for meat to look good.

169
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:34,248
-The meat quality…
-It's insane.

170
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:36,350
It's a work of art.

171
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:38,385
It looks tasty.

172
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:39,786
4 SERVINGS OF PORK BELLY

173
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:42,890
-Sir, this is four servings, right?
-Yes.

174
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:46,426
In that case, we should order
at least five more plates of this.

175
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:49,396
HEEBAB IS READY TO DEVOUR
AT LEAST 20 SERVINGS

176
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:53,000
-One plate per person.
-That still won't be enough.

177
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,236
The side dishes are here. Thank you.

178
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:00,874
-There's even aged kimchi.
-The kimchi looks great.

179
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,578
-Do we grill it together?
-Yes, you could do that.

180
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:05,746
Or eat it as it is.

181
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:06,813
AGED KIMCHI

182
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:09,583
FRESH GREEN ONION SALAD

183
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,218
CRUNCHY SEASONED BEAN SPROUT

184
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:13,053
SALTY AND TANGY PICKLED ONION

185
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:19,493
A TABLE FULL OF DISHES
TO ENJOY WITH PORK BELLY

186
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,228
MINSEONG GRILLS IT

187
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:23,030
Thank you.

188
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:25,966
The meat looks pretty.

189
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:27,267
TIME TO GRILL SOME MEAT

190
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:28,402
This is awesome.

191
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:34,775
JUST WATCHING IT STIRS YOUR APPETITE

192
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:40,881
A MOUTHWATERING SOUND

193
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:44,318
It doesn't look like the usual pork belly.

194
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:45,485
Because of the ribs.

195
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:47,287
A UNIQUE BUTTERFLY-SHAPED PORK BELLY

196
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:51,225
SMELLS IT FIRST BECAUSE HE'S HUNGRY

197
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,993
It's not good if you overcook it.

198
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,095
-Really?
-I don't overcook it, either.

199
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:57,064
-Shall we keep it at 70 percent?
-Yes.

200
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:59,967
-You and I have similar tastes.
-We sure do.

201
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:04,571
GRILL THE THINLY SLICED MEAT EVENLY

202
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:10,978
FLIP IT WHEN IT'S 70 PERCENT COOKED

203
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:15,449
GOLDEN BROWN

204
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,520
CAN'T TAKE THEIR EYES OFF
AT THE MOUTHWATERING SIGHT

205
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:25,025
-This is how we used to grill it.
-Thank you.

206
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:26,226
HOW'S THE PORK BELLY?

207
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,294
Thank you.

208
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:30,597
-Look at this.
-Thank you.

209
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:32,232
A BITE OF MEAT WITHOUT ANY SAUCE

210
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,502
TODAY'S CHEF LOOKS FORWARD
TO THEIR REACTION

211
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:39,473
My goodness.

212
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,843
She likes it. How much will you eat today?

213
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,444
SMILES AT HER FIRST BITE

214
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:47,614
It melts in your mouth.

215
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,384
THE FOREHEAD OF TRUTH

216
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,451
It melts away.

217
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:55,656
SATISFIED

218
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:58,425
Is it right to say it doesn't taste bland?

219
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:02,362
There's a sweetness that comes
from the fat, and it's so good.

220
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:08,435
This pork belly tastes like
a bite of fancy French butter.

221
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:09,670
It's so rich in flavor.

222
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:12,806
I just want to spread it on some bread.

223
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,775
THE PERFECT FAT RATIO BRINGS OUT FLAVOR

224
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:20,013
MEAT EXPERT DAVID LEE TRIES IT CAREFULLY

225
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,250
Since you're a meat expert,
what do you think of the meat quality?

226
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:24,585
It's excellent.

227
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:27,487
-It's the best pork I've ever had.
-You think so?

228
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:30,724
It's as thin as beef brisket.

229
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,360
IT'S LIKE THINLY SLICED BEEF BRISKET

230
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:37,631
I'm 30 years old.

231
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:41,068
-I could eat as many servings as my age.
-That would be 30.

232
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:45,205
HEEBAB TAKES A PIECE

233
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:47,875
-It's so yummy.
-Eat some more.

234
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,710
CONTEMPLATING

235
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,345
I'll take two pieces.

236
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,580
Two pieces at a time?

237
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:56,450
EATS TWO PIECES PER BITE

238
00:11:56,517 --> 00:12:02,289
It's been a long time since I've eaten
pork belly this thin at a restaurant.

239
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:07,928
The meat-to-fat ratio is incredible.

240
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:11,265
I love the thickness of this meat.

241
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:15,769
The thickness enhances
the fat's flavor to its fullest.

242
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:22,509
It's the same thickness that my father
first grilled for me when I was little.

243
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:25,612
There's a unique kind of satisfaction
that comes from this texture.

244
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:31,351
IS THIS REALLY PORK BELLY? IT'S FLUTTERING

245
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,954
Uncle, do you age this pork, too?

246
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:37,124
That's a must.

247
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,560
-For how many days?
-He does.

248
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,595
-About five days.
-I see.

249
00:12:41,662 --> 00:12:42,796
AGED FOR 5 DAYS

250
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:46,266
That's what brings out the umami.

251
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,102
It's like he seasoned it
with MSG beforehand.

252
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:50,671
The umami is fantastic.

253
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,539
THE PORK BELLY IS RICH IN UMAMI

254
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:58,011
I wish there were more places like this.

255
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:02,749
It's possible because it's locally sourced
and he cuts the meat himself.

256
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,785
He runs this place with his wife.

257
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:06,453
<i>They've run this for 28 years.</i>

258
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:12,125
THEY'VE MAINTAINED THIS MEAT RESTAURANT
FOR 28 YEARS THROUGH HARD WORK

259
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:14,795
Did you open this place yourself,
or did you inherit it?

260
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:16,230
-I opened it myself.
-I see.

261
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:20,200
Sir, how did you start
cutting meat like this

262
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:23,437
in such a unique way?

263
00:13:23,504 --> 00:13:26,406
There are many elderly people
living in this neighborhood.

264
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:27,975
MOST REGULARS ARE ELDERLY

265
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,844
-Their teeth…
-That's considerate of you.

266
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:34,581
<i>Many customers have bad teeth,</i>
<i>so I started cutting it thinly.</i>

267
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:38,819
<i>But young people also liked it,</i>
<i>and I liked the texture as well.</i>

268
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:41,054
<i>It all started</i>
<i>thanks to your thoughtfulness.</i>

269
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:44,591
THE OWNER'S THOUGHTFULNESS
EVEN WON OVER THE TASTES OF YOUNG PEOPLE

270
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:46,059
Anyone can do this.

271
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:47,594
It's his kindness.

272
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:51,832
-Anyone can, but they don't.
-It's troublesome.

273
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,800
People don't do this.

274
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:55,602
They serve thick cuts to customers.

275
00:13:55,669 --> 00:14:00,374
They say, "This is the trend nowadays,"
and leave it at that.

276
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,944
<i>But he even set up</i>
<i>a place to cut the meat.</i>

277
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,712
READY TO SERVE WITH DEVOTION

278
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:08,215
Green onion salad.

279
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:11,118
The green onions boost the meat's flavor.

280
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:16,557
YUMMY

281
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,661
It's irresistible.

282
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:23,463
How is it so soft?

283
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:28,168
FINDS WHAT TO EAT NEXT WHILE CHEWING

284
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:35,609
PLACES A PIECE OF MEAT ON THE LETTUCE

285
00:14:35,676 --> 00:14:37,978
EATS A SEPARATE PIECE

286
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:45,085
A MOUTHFUL OF THE MEAT WRAP

287
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,222
THUMBS UP

288
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:51,124
I wish this place didn't get too popular.

289
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:53,527
CAN'T HELP BUT VOICE HER FEELINGS

290
00:14:53,594 --> 00:14:57,397
This is a game-changer
in the pork belly business.

291
00:14:57,464 --> 00:14:58,465
Definitely.

292
00:14:58,532 --> 00:14:59,800
IT'S A REVOLUTION

293
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:01,735
It's perfect.

294
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,808
ALREADY DOWN TO THEIR LAST SERVING

295
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:09,643
Can we get another plate?

296
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,214
-You can keep it coming.
-Please keep it coming.

297
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:17,284
YOU CAN KEEP SLICING THE MEAT

298
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:19,753
I bet some people travel here
just to eat this.

299
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,324
-I would, too.
-It's worth the trip just for this.

300
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:26,760
THIS IS ENOUGH REASON TO COME TO SACHEON

301
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:32,266
HEEBAB KEEPS EATING TWO PIECES AT A TIME

302
00:15:34,568 --> 00:15:35,569
It's great.

303
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,972
-It's here.
-I love that it keeps coming.

304
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,174
ANOTHER PLATE OF MEAT

305
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,209
-This looks different.
-It's pork neck.

306
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:45,379
-You're right.
-Look at that.

307
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,882
-It's fun to keep ordering.
-You don't know what you will get.

308
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:52,519
ENJOYING A VARIETY
OF RANDOM TEXTURES AND FLAVORS

309
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:55,923
-I want to try this aged kimchi.
-Shall we grill this?

310
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,391
-Sounds great.
-Let's do that.

311
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:02,863
AGED KIMCHI PAIRS BEST WITH PORK BELLY

312
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:07,901
GRILLING AGED KIMCHI ON PORK FAT
IS GUARANTEED TO BE AMAZING

313
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:12,372
GRILL IT NICELY, AND IT'S READY TO EAT

314
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,508
Let's eat a piece with kimchi.

315
00:16:14,575 --> 00:16:17,344
-This will taste different.
-Of course.

316
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:21,181
HOW WILL AGED KIMCHI
AND PORK BELLY TASTE TOGETHER?

317
00:16:21,849 --> 00:16:25,352
EXTREMELY EXCITED

318
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:28,388
Oh, my gosh.

319
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:32,559
-Here's a sandwich.
-A meat sandwich.

320
00:16:32,626 --> 00:16:33,794
This is something new.

321
00:16:33,861 --> 00:16:35,495
AGED KIMCHI AND PORK BELLY SANDWICH

322
00:16:38,732 --> 00:16:39,733
YUMMY

323
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:47,641
ONE BITE AND YOU'LL REALIZE HOW GOOD IT IS

324
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:53,747
It's very chewy.

325
00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:55,682
HIGH-PITCH HUMS SHOW HOW GOOD IT IS

326
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,018
This kimchi is the best.

327
00:16:58,085 --> 00:17:00,354
STILL MESMERIZED BY THE AGED KIMCHI

328
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,357
It's like taking a bite of kimchi stew.

329
00:17:04,992 --> 00:17:09,463
Eating aged kimchi
grilled in this delicious pork fat

330
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:12,432
cleanses your palate.

331
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:15,702
REFRESHES THE PALATE

332
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:18,038
-This is great.
-It's so tasty.

333
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:22,209
I seriously want

334
00:17:22,276 --> 00:17:23,510
"MINSEONG IS ALSO MOVED"

335
00:17:23,577 --> 00:17:25,812
-to bring my parents here.
-Exactly.

336
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:30,284
I don't find lean meat very tasty.

337
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,187
-Fish and meat need fat for flavor.
-Right.

338
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:37,758
With just a proper amount of fat,
nothing beats its rich flavor.

339
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:39,026
People normally say

340
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:43,530
that it's safe to eat duck meat
because it contains unsaturated fats

341
00:17:43,597 --> 00:17:45,966
and pork isn't good for you
because it makes you fat.

342
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:48,302
-But pork contains unsaturated fats.
-Really?

343
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,137
-It doesn't store fat.
-I see.

344
00:17:50,838 --> 00:17:54,875
When you eat Japanese ramen these days,
you'll notice there's oil on top.

345
00:17:54,942 --> 00:17:57,077
-It's in <i>tonkotsu </i>broth.
-That's lard oil.

346
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:58,912
Lard oil?

347
00:17:58,979 --> 00:18:03,617
-I heard that lard oil is good for you.
-Yes, it was on the news not long ago.

348
00:18:03,684 --> 00:18:07,354
<i>The news rated it</i>
<i>as the eighth healthiest food.</i>

349
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:08,856
<i>-Lard oil?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

350
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:12,326
<i>-Then it's healthy food.</i>
<i>-It's high in amino acids.</i>

351
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:14,428
LARD OIL CONTAINS MANY GOOD NUTRIENTS

352
00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:18,465
IT'S NOT BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH

353
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:22,336
Is there a trend in pork belly barbecue?

354
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:23,871
-Yes.
-Of course.

355
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:28,075
In the 70s and early 80s,
they sliced the meat thin.

356
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:32,346
<i>The pork neck shoulder used to be</i>
<i>sliced thin and grilled on foil.</i>

357
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:35,582
THIN PORK SLICES GRILLED ON FOIL
OVER DIRECT HEAT IN THE 80S

358
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:37,784
<i>Next came frozen pork belly.</i>

359
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:39,887
FROZEN PORK BELLY
BECAME THICKER IN THE 90S

360
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:43,490
<i>After that, restaurants started serving</i>
<i>raw pork in whole slabs.</i>

361
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:47,427
WHOLE SLABS OF RAW PORK BELLY
GRILLED AND CUT INTO PIECES

362
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:50,430
Now, we're back to frozen pork belly.

363
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:53,400
-It keeps changing continuously.
-Exactly.

364
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:55,269
-Scored meat used to be a trend.
-Right.

365
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:57,337
Sir, can we get another plate?

366
00:18:57,404 --> 00:18:59,106
EYES FIXED

367
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:06,947
SERVING A PLATE OF PORK BELLY RIGHT AWAY

368
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:12,252
HEEBAB CAN'T TAKE HER EYES OFF THE MEAT

369
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:14,888
-How many servings did we eat?
-We've only had 20.

370
00:19:14,955 --> 00:19:17,891
-We've only had 20 servings.
-What do you mean by "only"?

371
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:21,662
UNBELIEVABLE

372
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:25,465
Sir, how much do four people usually eat?

373
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:27,534
-About ten servings.
-That sounds right.

374
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:30,804
Consider us as eight people.

375
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,775
MINSEONG FINDS HEEBAB'S
BIG APPETITE ADORABLE

376
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:39,079
-You haven't eaten enough yet.
-I feel like I haven't eaten anything.

377
00:19:39,146 --> 00:19:41,348
-Go for it, Heebab.
-I should eat rice.

378
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:43,150
Keep eating.

379
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:47,788
WE NEED TO FILL HEEBAB'S STOMACH

380
00:19:50,157 --> 00:19:52,626
SERVING HER TWO PIECES OF PORK BELLY

381
00:19:53,627 --> 00:19:56,697
A BITE OF PORK BELLY

382
00:19:58,098 --> 00:20:00,501
GONE IN NO TIME, SHE TAKES ANOTHER BITE

383
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:04,338
WHILE DUJUN EATS A SINGLE PIECE

384
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:07,174
HEEBAB DEVOURS TWO PIECES AT A TIME

385
00:20:08,075 --> 00:20:10,844
WHILE DAVID LEE EATS A SMALL WRAP

386
00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:15,315
HEEBAB EATS A BIGGER WRAP

387
00:20:17,985 --> 00:20:20,687
JAW-DROPPING TO WATCH HER EAT

388
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:24,024
CONTINUOUSLY EATING TWO PIECES
WITHOUT BLINKING AN EYE

389
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:27,427
CAN'T HELP BUT BE IN AWE

390
00:20:27,494 --> 00:20:30,230
Sir, can we get another plate?

391
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:31,365
One more, please.

392
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:32,900
ENDLESSLY ORDERS MORE SERVINGS

393
00:20:33,534 --> 00:20:36,370
SHE EATS 2 BITES, WHILE DUJUN EATS 1

394
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:38,138
HER 3RD BITE

395
00:20:38,205 --> 00:20:39,473
AND MINSEONG KEEPS GRILLING

396
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,475
HER 4TH BITE

397
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:42,910
HER 5TH BITE

398
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:44,945
I've never grilled this much in my life.

399
00:20:45,012 --> 00:20:46,113
My arm hurts.

400
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,683
I've been grilling the pork
from the start, you know?

401
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,151
One more plate, please.

402
00:20:51,218 --> 00:20:53,353
LET ME FEEL SORRY A BIT LONGER

403
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,256
We've ordered 32 servings.
Congratulations.

404
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,461
I'm full.

405
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:03,197
ONE IS FULL, THE OTHER IS HUNGRY

406
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:04,831
-My stomach will burst.
-Me too.

407
00:21:04,898 --> 00:21:06,233
HELP US

408
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,203
-I bet their stews are good.
-The soybean paste stew is good.

409
00:21:10,137 --> 00:21:13,140
SOYBEAN PASTE STEW IS SOLD IN 3 SIZES
AT A REASONABLE PRICE

410
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,076
-When do we eat the stew?
-Go ahead and order it.

411
00:21:16,143 --> 00:21:20,214
-Can we get the soybean paste stew?
-The large one, please.

412
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:22,349
SHE'S UNSTOPPABLE

413
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:25,485
-Were there different sizes?
-She whispered, "The large one."

414
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:26,820
ORDERED THE LARGE ONE SHYLY

415
00:21:26,887 --> 00:21:28,222
The stew is here.

416
00:21:30,057 --> 00:21:32,492
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

417
00:21:34,428 --> 00:21:37,865
BOILING

418
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:40,000
The color gives off old-school vibes.

419
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:44,905
SOYBEAN PASTE STEW HAS
A CLEAR, LIGHT BROWN BROTH

420
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:47,140
I'll try it first.

421
00:21:47,207 --> 00:21:49,576
TAKES A SIP OF THE BROTH FIRST

422
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:50,777
My gosh!

423
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:54,014
It's worth coming just for this stew.

424
00:21:54,748 --> 00:21:57,184
What did I tell you?

425
00:21:57,251 --> 00:22:00,220
-It's good.
-What is this? Why is it so refreshing?

426
00:22:00,287 --> 00:22:01,355
It tastes amazing.

427
00:22:02,189 --> 00:22:04,024
Each person should have one serving.

428
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:08,495
It's a digestive medicine.
It helps with digestion.

429
00:22:08,562 --> 00:22:10,364
<i>The broth is clear, but has flavor.</i>

430
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:13,000
<i>-Exactly.</i>
<i>-It isn't heavy, either.</i>

431
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,403
<i>It's like a mix of soybean paste stew</i>
<i>and soybean paste soup.</i>

432
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,905
<i>-It falls between the two.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

433
00:22:17,971 --> 00:22:19,973
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
SOYBEAN PASTE SOUP AND STEW

434
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,744
-And this place uses Manila clams.
-So, this is clam stock.

435
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:26,146
They used shucked clams.

436
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:31,151
BOIL WITH PLENTY OF SHUCKED MANILA CLAMS

437
00:22:31,218 --> 00:22:35,289
<i>They add shelled Manila clams,</i>
<i>so it's easy to eat.</i>

438
00:22:35,756 --> 00:22:38,592
<i>-This is insane. It's seafood stock.</i>
<i>-Isn't this seafood stock?</i>

439
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:40,561
<i>-It's Manila clam stock.</i>
<i>-Made of clams.</i>

440
00:22:40,627 --> 00:22:43,430
THE REFRESHING MANILA CLAMS
DEEPEN THE FLAVOR

441
00:22:43,497 --> 00:22:46,834
<i>-The tofu is sliced into flat pieces.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

442
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,436
It's so smooth, it could go up your nose.

443
00:22:49,503 --> 00:22:52,439
MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH

444
00:22:52,506 --> 00:22:54,608
It tastes super clean.

445
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:57,811
The chili is the game-changer.

446
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,348
SLICED CHEONGYANG PEPPERS

447
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:06,053
<i>It's mildly spicy.</i>

448
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:08,455
THE MILD KICK CLEANSES THE PALATE

449
00:23:09,456 --> 00:23:13,994
Since we changed the grill,
let me make a tasty food pairing.

450
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:15,429
Time for food pairs.

451
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:17,731
BUT THE GRILL IS EMPTY

452
00:23:18,198 --> 00:23:19,600
There's no meat, though.

453
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:20,667
WE DON'T HAVE ANY MEAT

454
00:23:22,936 --> 00:23:24,304
Is there no more meat?

455
00:23:25,305 --> 00:23:28,876
-There's no meat.
-He can't keep up with us.

456
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:30,844
This is my food pairing.

457
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:35,015
In the cockle season, I grill cockles,
pork belly, and aged kimchi together.

458
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:37,784
-Cockles?
-I tried grilling cockles once.

459
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:42,122
HEEBAB IS ONLY FOCUSED ON THE MEAT

460
00:23:42,189 --> 00:23:44,525
But it's not cockle season now.

461
00:23:45,726 --> 00:23:49,096
So, I use Manila clams instead.

462
00:23:49,162 --> 00:23:51,131
-You grill Manila clams?
-Yes, I do.

463
00:23:51,198 --> 00:23:53,800
-You mean the clam meat?
-Yes, shucked Manila clams.

464
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:55,636
-Here.
-Never thought of it.

465
00:23:55,702 --> 00:23:56,870
<i>It's in the stew.</i>

466
00:23:56,937 --> 00:24:00,240
USING SHUCKED MANILA CLAMS
FOR HIS FOOD PAIRING

467
00:24:00,307 --> 00:24:06,246
Pork and clams pair well
in Western dishes, too.

468
00:24:06,313 --> 00:24:07,781
It's a good pair.

469
00:24:09,683 --> 00:24:12,819
-The Manila clams are huge.
-Way to go, Samcheonpo.

470
00:24:13,587 --> 00:24:16,256
WHAT WILL IT TASTE LIKE?

471
00:24:16,323 --> 00:24:21,528
-Make a wall of pork around the grill.
-So the clams don't fall through.

472
00:24:22,729 --> 00:24:26,900
STIR-FRY CAREFULLY TO AVOID BURNING

473
00:24:27,601 --> 00:24:30,237
That's cool. This is new to me.

474
00:24:30,337 --> 00:24:31,438
NEVER SEEN IT

475
00:24:33,006 --> 00:24:38,512
HOW SHOULD WE EAT
THE PORK BELLY AND MANILA CLAMS?

476
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:39,746
Look at that.

477
00:24:41,114 --> 00:24:43,183
-Try it.
-Just these two?

478
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,587
<i>-Incredible.</i>
<i>-It's perfect.</i>

479
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:49,957
PAIR WELL-COOKED PORK BELLY
WITH MANILA CLAMS ON TOP

480
00:24:53,093 --> 00:24:56,463
GOURMET HEEBAB TAKES THE FIRST BITE

481
00:24:57,698 --> 00:25:02,569
DAVID TRIES AGED KIMCHI, MANILA CLAM,
AND PORK BELLY TOGETHER

482
00:25:05,305 --> 00:25:08,275
WHAT DOES IT TASTE LIKE?

483
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:09,776
It's chewy.

484
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:11,078
I AGREE

485
00:25:11,144 --> 00:25:12,145
It's sweet.

486
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:16,116
-It tastes sweet.
-Doesn't it enhance the flavor?

487
00:25:16,183 --> 00:25:19,887
-Grilling it in lard doubles the umami.
-It's like eating clam chowder.

488
00:25:19,953 --> 00:25:24,892
-You're right.
-It's very creamy, like white pasta.

489
00:25:25,459 --> 00:25:26,793
<i>This is unbelievable.</i>

490
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,695
<i>-Isn't it tasty?</i>
<i>-It's terrific.</i>

491
00:25:28,762 --> 00:25:32,733
CHEWY TEXTURE WITH A RICH, CREAMY FLAVOR

492
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,469
-Try grilling Manila clams at home.
-Really?

493
00:25:35,536 --> 00:25:38,005
Grill some Manila clams
and meat in a frying pan.

494
00:25:38,105 --> 00:25:39,606
Oysters and pork belly together.

495
00:25:39,673 --> 00:25:41,642
<i>I've never had shucked clams this way.</i>

496
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:45,078
STRONGLY RECOMMEND
EATING MANILA CLAMS WITH PORK BELLY

497
00:25:45,612 --> 00:25:48,916
-How was it today?
-Honestly, I was surprised today.

498
00:25:48,982 --> 00:25:50,250
HOW WAS HIS GO-TO SPOT?

499
00:25:50,317 --> 00:25:52,920
It's way better than I expected.

500
00:25:52,986 --> 00:25:56,323
-I agree.
-I was impressed by how tasty it was.

501
00:25:57,024 --> 00:26:00,160
I've been to a lot of good meat places,

502
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:03,797
but this is the first where the basics
is what made the meat taste great

503
00:26:04,464 --> 00:26:08,702
I've never been to a place that really
sticks to the fundamentals like this,

504
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:10,070
That's why the food is good.

505
00:26:10,871 --> 00:26:16,043
If this had been ordinary pork belly,
I wouldn't ever see Chef Minseong again.

506
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,811
Excuse me?

507
00:26:18,612 --> 00:26:20,581
But now I want to see you all the time.

508
00:26:21,148 --> 00:26:24,852
The food here
definitely leaves an impression.

509
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:27,921
I would come again,
even if it takes hours to get here.

510
00:26:28,522 --> 00:26:31,425
-It's worth it.
-I would take a trip here with my family.

511
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:34,061
-I want to bring someone special here.
-Exactly.

512
00:26:34,127 --> 00:26:36,363
A PLACE YOU WANT TO VISIT
WITH YOUR LOVED ONES

513
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:39,433
<i>What does this place mean to you?</i>

514
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,936
It's like a nice, cozy reception room.

515
00:26:44,338 --> 00:26:48,509
There's only one reason people come here.
It's because the quality is consistent.

516
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:52,746
You can come here anytime with anyone,
and it won't disappoint.

517
00:26:53,347 --> 00:26:55,682
-Yes, it's the best.
-Thank you for the meal.

518
00:26:55,749 --> 00:27:00,020
I'm so happy
that you three enjoyed the food.

519
00:27:00,087 --> 00:27:02,155
-I loved it.
-I couldn't be happier.

520
00:27:02,422 --> 00:27:04,324
-Thank you.
-It's nothing.

521
00:27:04,391 --> 00:27:07,494
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Uncle.

522
00:27:07,561 --> 00:27:09,329
-You're welcome.
-This was great.

523
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:13,767
<i>It won't be easy to find</i>
<i>pork belly this good anywhere else.</i>

524
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:16,003
<i>It was scrumptious.</i>
<i>I hope people come here.</i>

525
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:19,673
GEUMHO MEAT RESTAURANT

526
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,074
EPISODE 6

527
00:27:23,877 --> 00:27:29,149
-Uncle, how many servings have we had?
-You've had 36.

528
00:27:29,216 --> 00:27:31,385
Is it because
a plate contains four servings?

529
00:27:31,451 --> 00:27:33,587
I'd like to order the banquet noodles.

530
00:27:33,654 --> 00:27:36,523
HEEBAB ORDERED BANQUET NOODLES

531
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,991
If they ask where I bought it…

532
00:27:38,058 --> 00:27:39,426
SLURPING A BIG BITE

533
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:43,430
I should ask Chef Minseong
next time he visits Samcheonpo.

534
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:45,299
And ask me to bring you some meat?

535
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,035
HER SECOND SLURP

536
00:27:48,101 --> 00:27:49,670
For those who visited today…

537
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:53,207
FINISHED IN THREE SLURPS

538
00:27:53,974 --> 00:27:57,578
The stew and the banquet noodles
are perfect accompaniments to pork belly.

539
00:27:57,644 --> 00:27:58,812
They're all refreshing.

540
00:27:58,879 --> 00:28:00,414
BILL: 459,000 WON

541
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,850
