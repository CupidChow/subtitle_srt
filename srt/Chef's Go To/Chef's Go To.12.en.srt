FOODIE BROTHERS: THE FOURTH, YOON DUJUN

THE THIRD, LIM TAEHOON

YOUNGEST, YOON NAMNO

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,020
I haven't come to Gwanghwamun for so long.

5
00:00:10,086 --> 00:00:13,390
<i>I come here often</i>
<i>to visit Ky*bo B*ok C*ntre.</i>

00:00:13,456 --> 00:00:15,158
SEJONGNO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL

7
00:00:15,225 --> 00:00:18,929
There is the statue of Admiral Yi Sunsin
here at Gwanghwamun Square.

8
00:00:18,995 --> 00:00:20,230
ADMIRAL YI SUNSIN

9
00:00:20,297 --> 00:00:22,265
<i>There's a statue of King Sejong the Great.</i>

10
00:00:22,332 --> 00:00:23,333
KING SEJONG THE GREAT

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,170
<i>So, it seems to be a popular tourist area.</i>

12
00:00:29,873 --> 00:00:33,176
<i>The Government Complex Seoul</i>
<i>is right there in front of us.</i>

13
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:36,479
<i>And major corporate buildings are here,</i>
<i>so it's always crowded.</i>

14
00:00:36,546 --> 00:00:38,815
THIS AREA HAS HIGH FOOT TRAFFIC

15
00:00:38,882 --> 00:00:40,617
We should meet the chef for today.

16
00:00:40,684 --> 00:00:42,852
Who invited today's chef?

17
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:46,923
-I invited today's chef.
-Okay, Chef Taehoon invited them.

18
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,626
-They are in their 40s.
-I see.

19
00:00:49,693 --> 00:00:52,495
They have been a cook for 20 years.

20
00:00:52,963 --> 00:00:54,631
They're a Chinese cuisine chef.

21
00:00:54,698 --> 00:00:56,700
-Really?
-Yes.

22
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:58,635
-This is the most important thing.
-Okay.

23
00:00:59,569 --> 00:01:01,004
They look like Wi Hajun.

24
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:02,639
Are you talking about yourself?

25
00:01:03,373 --> 00:01:05,976
APOLOGIES TO WI HAJUN'S FANS

26
00:01:06,042 --> 00:01:08,278
Stop rambling on about yourself.

27
00:01:08,345 --> 00:01:11,348
-It's too hot right now.
-Just say it's you. It's too hot for this.

28
00:01:11,414 --> 00:01:14,351
-Are you today's chef?
-Yes.

29
00:01:14,417 --> 00:01:15,719
TODAY'S CHEF: LIM TAEHOON

30
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:17,487
I work near Gyeongbokgung Palace.

31
00:01:17,554 --> 00:01:20,590
And I used to run
two restaurants in this area.

32
00:01:20,657 --> 00:01:22,392
I know tons of good restaurants,

33
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:25,195
so I will introduce one of them to you.

34
00:01:25,262 --> 00:01:28,331
So, will it be the three of us today?

35
00:01:28,398 --> 00:01:30,500
-It feels empty with only us.
-It sure does.

36
00:01:30,567 --> 00:01:36,172
But I have a really close friend
I wanted to go to this restaurant with,

37
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,607
so I invited him.

38
00:01:37,674 --> 00:01:40,243
WHO IS THIS CLOSE FRIEND?

39
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,311
Hey, come here.

40
00:01:41,845 --> 00:01:44,681
-He's here.
-Hello.

41
00:01:45,515 --> 00:01:47,817
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

42
00:01:47,884 --> 00:01:49,753
-Hey, there.
-Good to see you.

43
00:01:50,987 --> 00:01:54,658
There comes a time
for an idea of cosmic scale.

44
00:01:54,724 --> 00:01:55,926
To put it simply,

45
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:58,094
we don't fully understand
Newtonian mechanics.

46
00:01:58,161 --> 00:02:00,864
ORBIT
SCIENCE COMMUNICATOR

47
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:03,300
Hello, I'm Orbit, a science communicator.

48
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:05,602
WELCOME

49
00:02:05,669 --> 00:02:07,971
-He's the best.
-We're having good food, right?

50
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:09,205
That's right.

51
00:02:09,272 --> 00:02:12,709
Taehoon, please tell us
about today's go-to place.

52
00:02:12,776 --> 00:02:14,477
It's a long-standing place.

53
00:02:14,544 --> 00:02:15,879
-How long?
-About 50 years.

54
00:02:15,946 --> 00:02:17,080
-Seriously?
-Yes.

55
00:02:17,147 --> 00:02:22,819
Office workers around Gyeongbokgung Palace
go there for work dinners.

56
00:02:22,886 --> 00:02:25,689
-Really?
-Yes, they go there often.

57
00:02:25,755 --> 00:02:28,024
Most work at the Government Complex Seoul.

58
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:29,125
What is its name?

59
00:02:29,726 --> 00:02:31,328
-Daebokjip.
-Okay.

60
00:02:31,394 --> 00:02:32,662
-"Bokjip"?
-Bok?

61
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:34,231
Are we having pufferfish today?

62
00:02:34,297 --> 00:02:37,000
Or maybe it just means "to bring in luck"?

63
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:38,635
-Maybe.
-Right.

64
00:02:39,236 --> 00:02:41,137
Let's get going since we're hungry.

65
00:02:41,204 --> 00:02:42,439
-Are you hungry?
-Yes.

66
00:02:42,505 --> 00:02:44,107
Being hungry is science.

67
00:02:44,774 --> 00:02:47,477
We have to eat when we feel hungry.

68
00:02:47,544 --> 00:02:49,479
-What is instinct?
-Let's see…

69
00:02:49,546 --> 00:02:55,018
Instinct is something we have long sensed
as beneficial to our survival.

70
00:02:55,085 --> 00:02:57,387
-It's connected to our survival.
-Stop. Let's go.

71
00:02:57,454 --> 00:02:59,189
-I'm hungry.
-Walking is also science.

72
00:02:59,256 --> 00:03:01,324
-Off we go.
-Going is also…

73
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:03,793
-Bipedalism is science as well.
-Come on.

74
00:03:04,861 --> 00:03:06,963
-That's hilarious.
-Let's walk on two legs.

75
00:03:09,266 --> 00:03:10,500
<i>He's so funny.</i>

76
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:12,335
WALKING ALONG THE STONE WALL PATH

77
00:03:12,402 --> 00:03:13,803
CROSS THE STREET, KEEP WALKING

78
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,807
-The restaurant is hidden in an alley.
-Okay.

79
00:03:18,475 --> 00:03:20,110
Wait, I see the sign.

80
00:03:21,177 --> 00:03:22,679
-It says "Daebokjip."
-Right.

81
00:03:22,746 --> 00:03:26,483
Wow, the building looks like
it's been here a long time.

82
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,418
THE GO-TO SPOT FEELS LIKE AN ANTIQUE

83
00:03:28,485 --> 00:03:32,589
<i>It has a traditional Korean</i>
<i>tiled roof and design.</i>

84
00:03:32,656 --> 00:03:34,124
-I see.
-It has a Korean vibe.

85
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,026
<i>It looks like an amazing restaurant.</i>

86
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,463
-Oh, there's our sign.
-It says "Chef's Go-To."

87
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,466
-Hello.
-Welcome.

88
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:45,669
THE OWNER GIVES A WARM WELCOME

89
00:03:45,735 --> 00:03:48,371
-Mom, Mr. Lim is here.
-Hello, ma'am.

90
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:50,373
-Oh, it's been a while.
-Yes, it has.

91
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,942
-Nice to see you again.
-Hello.

92
00:03:52,008 --> 00:03:53,143
BOW

93
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:55,378
-Nice to meet you.
-We have a lot of visitors.

94
00:03:55,445 --> 00:03:56,513
She is the owner.

95
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,647
HEO DONGJA
53 YEARS HERE

96
00:03:57,714 --> 00:04:00,917
-Hello.
-This place has been here for 50 years.

97
00:04:00,984 --> 00:04:04,054
I've run this place since 1973.

98
00:04:04,588 --> 00:04:07,557
<i>-Let's take our table.</i>
<i>-Sure.</i>

99
00:04:08,758 --> 00:04:12,229
-Let's have what Taehoon recommends.
-I can't wait.

100
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:14,798
-I usually have a course meal.
-Oh, there's a menu.

101
00:04:14,864 --> 00:04:18,335
WHAT'S THE FIRST COURSE ON THE MENU?

102
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:20,804
Could we please have
four servings of pork belly?

103
00:04:22,505 --> 00:04:25,108
<i>-This place is called Daebokjip.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

104
00:04:25,775 --> 00:04:27,811
What comes to mind when you think of it?

105
00:04:27,878 --> 00:04:29,512
-Pufferfish.
-Right?

106
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:32,115
This place used to sell pufferfish.

107
00:04:32,182 --> 00:04:34,684
-Now, I get it.
-That's why it's called that.

108
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:36,786
They always have "bok" in their names.

109
00:04:36,853 --> 00:04:38,755
There are many other restaurants nearby.

110
00:04:38,822 --> 00:04:41,291
How did this place become your go-to spot?

111
00:04:41,358 --> 00:04:44,961
The landlady of the building where
I opened my first restaurant, Aryang,

112
00:04:45,028 --> 00:04:48,031
-was also the landlady here.
-You wanted to make a good impression.

113
00:04:48,098 --> 00:04:50,467
No, that wasn't the reason I came here.

114
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:51,902
-You had to eat somewhere.
-No.

115
00:04:51,968 --> 00:04:54,437
-Exactly.
-You might as well eat your meals here.

116
00:04:54,504 --> 00:04:56,039
I shouldn't have invited him.

117
00:04:57,374 --> 00:04:59,643
-My bad.
-He's hilarious.

118
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:02,646
-He's going too far.
-You wanted to renew the lease.

119
00:05:02,712 --> 00:05:06,249
One time, I came here as a customer.

120
00:05:06,316 --> 00:05:09,419
But the food was unbelievably good,
so I became a regular here.

121
00:05:09,486 --> 00:05:11,788
So, how long have you been coming here?

122
00:05:11,855 --> 00:05:14,090
-About ten years.
-Ten years?

123
00:05:14,858 --> 00:05:17,594
You'd never guess
this place has been around for so long

124
00:05:17,661 --> 00:05:19,029
because it's so clean.

125
00:05:19,095 --> 00:05:20,230
I agree.

126
00:05:20,297 --> 00:05:23,900
<i>It's kind of like a really old car</i>
<i>that has been well cared for.</i>

127
00:05:23,967 --> 00:05:25,201
IT'S NEAT AND WELL-KEPT

128
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,309
There are plenty of side dishes.

129
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,410
SIDES DISHES ARE HERE

130
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,913
Try the side dishes
after they are all laid out.

131
00:05:38,415 --> 00:05:40,984
I can't believe there are this many.

132
00:05:41,484 --> 00:05:44,688
<i>These are the side dishes that come</i>
<i>with the soybean paste stew.</i>

133
00:05:44,754 --> 00:05:46,690
<i>-Is there soybean paste stew?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

134
00:05:46,756 --> 00:05:48,058
You can have it for lunch.

135
00:05:48,124 --> 00:05:49,159
SPICY RADISH SALAD

136
00:05:49,226 --> 00:05:50,694
YOUNG RADISH KIMCHI

137
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,229
SEASONED BEAN SPROUTS

138
00:05:52,295 --> 00:05:55,899
<i>There are different side dishes</i>
<i>for lunch and dinner.</i>

139
00:05:55,966 --> 00:05:57,033
5 SIDE DISHES FOR LUNCH

140
00:05:57,801 --> 00:06:00,136
What side dishes do
barbecue restaurants serve now?

141
00:06:00,203 --> 00:06:04,174
Usually, it's just kimchi,
veggies, and sauce.

142
00:06:04,241 --> 00:06:05,575
I don't think there are many.

143
00:06:05,642 --> 00:06:07,744
-There's pickled onion.
-Pickled radish slices.

144
00:06:07,811 --> 00:06:10,280
-Green onion salad, too.
-What shall we try?

145
00:06:10,347 --> 00:06:12,449
-Let's try the bean sprouts first.
-Okay.

146
00:06:13,049 --> 00:06:16,553
TRYING THE SEASONED BEAN SPROUTS FIRST

147
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,622
-It's delicious.
-Is it good?

148
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:24,060
NAMNO TAKES A BITE AS WELL

149
00:06:24,127 --> 00:06:25,462
ISN'T IT TASTY?

150
00:06:27,864 --> 00:06:30,066
-Isn't it perfectly seasoned?
-It is.

151
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:33,737
-I'm really craving rice.
-Me too.

152
00:06:33,803 --> 00:06:35,171
CRAVING RICE AFTER ONE BITE

153
00:06:35,238 --> 00:06:40,544
Actually, this isn't a favorite of mine,
so I don't usually eat it.

154
00:06:40,944 --> 00:06:44,114
SEASONED WATER PARSLEY AND CHIVE
THAT ORBIT DOESN'T USUALLY EAT

155
00:06:44,948 --> 00:06:46,917
TAKES A BITE

156
00:06:46,983 --> 00:06:47,984
Hold on.

157
00:06:49,352 --> 00:06:51,254
This is scrumptious, by the way.

158
00:06:53,523 --> 00:06:55,825
WOW

159
00:06:55,892 --> 00:06:59,062
-Wait, is this water parsley?
-You're right.

160
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,098
-It's good.
-Aren't these chives?

161
00:07:02,165 --> 00:07:03,333
Yes, it's mixed together.

162
00:07:04,034 --> 00:07:07,404
COMBINES THE CHOPPED
WATER PARSLEY AND CHIVES

163
00:07:08,371 --> 00:07:11,308
MIXES THEM THOROUGHLY
WITH SEASONING AND OTHER VEGGIES

164
00:07:11,374 --> 00:07:15,178
KO JEONGJA
HEAD CHEF OF DAEBOKJIP FOR 30 YEARS

165
00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:19,149
THE FLAVOR COMES
FROM MIXING THE WATER PARSLEY AND CHIVES

166
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:23,954
<i>It's absolutely delicious</i>
<i>because it tastes fresh and sweet.</i>

167
00:07:25,722 --> 00:07:28,825
-Let's try the young radish kimchi next.
-Looks refreshing.

168
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:33,263
TAKES A BIG BITE OF IT

169
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:40,070
AT A LOSS FOR WORDS

170
00:07:40,303 --> 00:07:42,439
I'm not overreacting. This tastes amazing.

171
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,341
Like this.

172
00:07:46,543 --> 00:07:51,114
YUM

173
00:07:51,748 --> 00:07:54,084
DUJUN ALSO TAKES A BITE

174
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,185
YUM

175
00:07:56,786 --> 00:07:59,623
-I just want to mix rice in it.
-Me too.

176
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:01,358
The flavor is very well-balanced.

177
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:05,562
-Young radish has a slightly bitter taste.
-Right.

178
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:08,832
That goes well
with the refreshing kimchi juice.

179
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,801
<i>I love those flavors in my mouth.</i>

180
00:08:11,868 --> 00:08:14,170
-I love the bitter taste.
-Exactly.

181
00:08:14,237 --> 00:08:17,107
<i>The bitterness adds depth to the flavor.</i>

182
00:08:17,173 --> 00:08:19,743
THE BITTER YOUNG RADISH KIMCHI
ENHANCES THE RICHNESS

183
00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:22,212
These side dishes pair well with meat.

184
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,281
-Absolutely.
-Water parsley, bean sprouts…

185
00:08:24,347 --> 00:08:26,383
And anchovies as well.

186
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:28,351
These are widely used in Western cuisine.

187
00:08:28,418 --> 00:08:30,654
-Right.
-They go well with meat.

188
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:34,591
ADDS GRAIN SYRUP TO SALTY DRIED ANCHOVIES

189
00:08:35,091 --> 00:08:37,494
STIR-FRIED ANCHOVIES
BOOST THE MEAT'S SALTY FLAVOR

190
00:08:38,161 --> 00:08:40,664
THE REFRESHING AND SPICY FLAVORS
COME TOGETHER WELL

191
00:08:41,231 --> 00:08:43,934
THE SPICY RADISH SALAD
CUTS THROUGH THE MEAT'S GREASINESS

192
00:08:45,335 --> 00:08:48,538
A FEAST OF SIDE DISHES
THAT IS PERFECT ALONGSIDE MEAT

193
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:54,811
It's fun to enjoy different side dishes
one at a time.

194
00:08:54,878 --> 00:08:57,547
From a scientific point of view,
cooking is…

195
00:08:57,614 --> 00:08:58,882
Cooking is science.

196
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:03,153
The bitterness in the middle
is very important.

197
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,655
-Grapefruit is a good example.
-I see.

198
00:09:05,722 --> 00:09:08,858
For instance, it's are used
in seafood dishes for a reason.

199
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:12,162
It's acidic,
but also brings out the seafood's flavor.

200
00:09:12,229 --> 00:09:15,165
The bitterness tones down
the other pungent flavors.

201
00:09:15,232 --> 00:09:19,536
We evolved to taste bitterness because
it alerts us to avoid harmful foods.

202
00:09:20,203 --> 00:09:23,039
Because bitterness
usually comes from fruit.

203
00:09:23,106 --> 00:09:25,208
-Right.
-Fruit tastes bitter

204
00:09:25,275 --> 00:09:29,145
so that we don't eat it before it ripens
and gets ready for reproduction.

205
00:09:29,212 --> 00:09:30,347
A defense mechanism.

206
00:09:30,413 --> 00:09:34,217
If I eat it now,
it won't be able to reproduce.

207
00:09:34,284 --> 00:09:35,986
PREVENTS FAILURE TO REPRODUCE

208
00:09:36,052 --> 00:09:39,256
Wow, it's impressive
when Namno talks about cooking.

209
00:09:39,322 --> 00:09:40,423
-Isn't he sexy?
-Yes.

210
00:09:40,991 --> 00:09:43,493
PROUD

211
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,595
It's finally here.

212
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:48,198
-Chef Taehoon, put it on the grill.
-Sure.

213
00:09:48,265 --> 00:09:50,333
THE PORK BELLY IS HERE

214
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,069
-It's good quality meat.
-It sure is.

215
00:09:53,136 --> 00:09:55,238
<i>It looks absolutely perfect.</i>

216
00:09:57,407 --> 00:10:01,811
THE PERFECT BALANCE OF WHITE FAT
AND BRIGHT RED LEAN MEAT

217
00:10:02,312 --> 00:10:04,681
-Taehoon, are you good at grilling?
-Of course.

218
00:10:04,748 --> 00:10:06,516
Here we go.

219
00:10:21,565 --> 00:10:24,434
CAN'T WAIT

220
00:10:24,501 --> 00:10:25,669
TO EAT IT

221
00:10:25,735 --> 00:10:28,471
-Wow, this is…
-Why does it make that sizzling sound?

222
00:10:28,538 --> 00:10:31,041
There's moisture on the meat.

223
00:10:31,107 --> 00:10:33,710
It makes that sound
as it quickly evaporates on heat.

224
00:10:33,777 --> 00:10:35,345
<i>Now I get it.</i>

225
00:10:35,412 --> 00:10:38,281
THIS IS THE SIZZLING SOUND

226
00:10:40,984 --> 00:10:44,154
-When I grill the meat…
-Oh, okay.

227
00:10:44,221 --> 00:10:47,057
-Is this your way?
-Yes, it is.

228
00:10:47,123 --> 00:10:49,125
I only flip it once.

229
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:51,361
Then I eat it once it's cooked.

230
00:10:51,428 --> 00:10:54,231
FLIP IT ONCE, AND EAT WHEN IT'S COOKED

231
00:10:55,465 --> 00:10:58,702
-But it's better to flip it several times.
-Really? Is it better?

232
00:10:58,768 --> 00:11:00,237
No, it's not.

233
00:11:00,303 --> 00:11:03,240
-Look at the thickness of the meat.
-Okay.

234
00:11:03,773 --> 00:11:05,008
-It's thin.
-Right.

235
00:11:05,075 --> 00:11:08,078
So, if you flip it too many times,

236
00:11:08,144 --> 00:11:10,146
it loses all the juice.

237
00:11:10,213 --> 00:11:14,284
Actually, keeping the meat juicy
depends on how fast you grill it.

238
00:11:14,351 --> 00:11:17,520
As time passes,
the meat gradually loses moisture.

239
00:11:17,587 --> 00:11:21,191
But if you flip it once,
one side will be overcooked.

240
00:11:21,258 --> 00:11:25,428
And the other side will still be cold,
so the temperature of the grill drops.

241
00:11:25,495 --> 00:11:27,530
-Taehoon, he says this is overcooked.
-Yes.

242
00:11:27,597 --> 00:11:28,798
EMBARRASSED

243
00:11:28,865 --> 00:11:30,467
The sides are not well-balanced.

244
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:35,305
It's better to flip it often,
but there's a drawback.

245
00:11:35,372 --> 00:11:36,740
It's a hassle.

246
00:11:36,806 --> 00:11:38,842
We don't want to waste too much energy.

247
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:40,710
I flip it once in the name of science.

248
00:11:40,777 --> 00:11:43,079
WHAT IS UP WITH HIM?

249
00:11:44,748 --> 00:11:48,552
ANYWAY, A PLATE OF PORK BELLY
IS COOKED NICELY

250
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:51,688
Let's see if this is good.

251
00:11:51,755 --> 00:11:54,024
-Have some of this.
-Okay.

252
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,959
We'll eat it ourselves. Thank you.

253
00:11:56,226 --> 00:11:59,729
When I eat pork belly,

254
00:11:59,796 --> 00:12:02,599
-I eat it with salt first.
-Exactly.

255
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,100
EAT IT WITH SALT FIRST

256
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:07,070
I'll eat it with salt, which is a classic.

257
00:12:07,137 --> 00:12:08,538
NAMNO TRIES IT FIRST

258
00:12:15,145 --> 00:12:17,013
YUM

259
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,516
-How is it?
-It's delicious.

260
00:12:20,383 --> 00:12:22,252
-It's so nutty.
-Is it good?

261
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:25,088
-It's savory and nice.
-It's awesome.

262
00:12:25,155 --> 00:12:28,725
It tastes like the pork belly
my parents used to grill for me at home

263
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:30,427
when I was little.

264
00:12:30,493 --> 00:12:33,363
The food here is nicely balanced.

265
00:12:33,964 --> 00:12:36,099
<i>The ratio of fat</i>
<i>and lean meat is excellent.</i>

266
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,168
<i>-Definitely.</i>
<i>-I'm loving it.</i>

267
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:40,337
The pork tastes very fresh.

268
00:12:40,403 --> 00:12:41,605
IT TASTES CLEAN

269
00:12:41,671 --> 00:12:43,707
It will be great with the side dishes.

270
00:12:43,773 --> 00:12:46,843
-It's even better if you eat it together.
-Exactly.

271
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,813
HE WRAPS IT
IN SEASONED WATER PARSLEY AND CHIVE

272
00:12:51,481 --> 00:12:52,716
This is incredible.

273
00:12:52,782 --> 00:12:54,551
-Isn't it tasty?
-Absolutely.

274
00:12:55,185 --> 00:12:59,322
ORBIT ALSO HAS A BITE
WITH SEASONED WATER PARSLEY AND CHIVE

275
00:13:03,226 --> 00:13:06,997
NAMNO ENJOYS THE FOOD PAIRING AS WELL

276
00:13:07,063 --> 00:13:08,331
NODS

277
00:13:08,398 --> 00:13:11,268
Orbit ate the meat wrapped
with water parsley just now.

278
00:13:11,334 --> 00:13:14,204
-Wow, it's unbelievable.
-I also ate it like that.

279
00:13:14,271 --> 00:13:17,040
This water parsley
is absolutely incredible.

280
00:13:17,107 --> 00:13:18,108
<i>Isn't it yummy?</i>

281
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:21,545
SAVORY PORK BELLY AND REFRESHING
WATER PARSLEY PAIR PERFECTLY

282
00:13:22,546 --> 00:13:26,449
TRYING MEAT WITH SEASONED
WATER PARSLEY AND CHIVE AGAIN

283
00:13:26,816 --> 00:13:28,818
I'm loving this combination.

284
00:13:28,885 --> 00:13:30,987
-With the water parsley?
-Yes, it's insane.

285
00:13:31,054 --> 00:13:33,957
-I ate all of it.
-Could we please get more water parsley?

286
00:13:34,024 --> 00:13:35,091
-Sure.
-Thank you.

287
00:13:37,661 --> 00:13:39,296
-This is excellent.
-Thank you.

288
00:13:39,362 --> 00:13:40,931
AN EXTRA PLATE

289
00:13:40,997 --> 00:13:43,266
AND ANOTHER

290
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,768
Can we get another refill?

291
00:13:44,834 --> 00:13:45,835
-Which one?
-This one.

292
00:13:45,902 --> 00:13:47,237
-Of course.
-Thank you.

293
00:13:48,004 --> 00:13:49,973
CAN'T GET ENOUGH
OF THIS AMAZING COMBINATION

294
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,475
SEASONED WATER PARSLEY AND CHIVE
WITH PORK BELLY

295
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:55,579
What's interesting
about making lettuce wraps is…

296
00:13:55,645 --> 00:14:00,016
It's an awesome way to just wrap
the side dishes that you want.

297
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,986
The meat acts like rice.

298
00:14:03,587 --> 00:14:06,223
-And then you add the side dishes.
-Exactly.

299
00:14:06,289 --> 00:14:10,560
Since it's well-balanced,
it's like eating side dishes with rice.

300
00:14:10,627 --> 00:14:11,628
It's yummy.

301
00:14:12,162 --> 00:14:14,931
The head chef has
a real talent for cooking.

302
00:14:14,998 --> 00:14:16,366
The side dishes are unreal.

303
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:18,501
I really like the food here.

304
00:14:18,568 --> 00:14:19,970
DUJUN IS ADDICTED AS WELL

305
00:14:22,305 --> 00:14:24,708
This is insanely delicious.

306
00:14:24,774 --> 00:14:25,775
SATISFIED

307
00:14:25,842 --> 00:14:27,744
This water parsley hits the spot.

308
00:14:27,811 --> 00:14:29,913
Ma'am, excuse me.

309
00:14:30,881 --> 00:14:34,284
Can we please have some cucumber salad
that's only served for dinner?

310
00:14:34,351 --> 00:14:37,087
-And the kimchi, please.
-Got it.

311
00:14:37,153 --> 00:14:38,388
Thank you so much.

312
00:14:38,455 --> 00:14:40,657
The cucumber salad
and kimchi are delicious.

313
00:14:40,724 --> 00:14:42,359
But you can only have it at dinner.

314
00:14:42,425 --> 00:14:45,128
Why are there different side dishes?

315
00:14:45,195 --> 00:14:49,933
Soybean paste stew is on the lunch menu.

316
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,502
-Customers have to eat quickly and leave.
-To save time.

317
00:14:52,569 --> 00:14:55,538
There are many civil servants
and office workers here.

318
00:14:55,605 --> 00:14:56,773
That's why it changes.

319
00:14:57,574 --> 00:15:00,310
-I want to try the soybean paste stew.
-Let's eat it later.

320
00:15:00,377 --> 00:15:01,511
-A bit later?
-Yes.

321
00:15:03,713 --> 00:15:04,848
Oh, it's here.

322
00:15:05,382 --> 00:15:06,983
Thank you.

323
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,286
CUCUMBER SALAD AND KIMCHI ARE HERE

324
00:15:09,352 --> 00:15:10,987
Wow, it looks amazing.

325
00:15:11,054 --> 00:15:12,322
CUCUMBER SALAD LOOKS GOOD

326
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:14,257
I love cucumbers.

327
00:15:14,324 --> 00:15:16,059
This kimchi is to die for.

328
00:15:16,626 --> 00:15:19,129
-All of the side dishes are so tasty.
-It's unreal.

329
00:15:19,195 --> 00:15:20,463
-It smells insane.
-I know.

330
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,098
-Can I smell it?
-Sure.

331
00:15:23,133 --> 00:15:24,134
WOW

332
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,902
It smells like tangy aged kimchi.

333
00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:27,637
-It doesn't smell bad.
-Exactly.

334
00:15:28,471 --> 00:15:31,942
<i>It's nicely fermented</i>
<i>and smells fresh, not funky.</i>

335
00:15:34,678 --> 00:15:36,346
Wow, this is the stuff.

336
00:15:37,647 --> 00:15:39,983
All of the side dishes are excellent.

337
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:43,553
I always eat cucumber salad like this.

338
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,788
TAEHOON'S TIP

339
00:15:44,854 --> 00:15:47,757
-I add a sliced cucumber and onion.
-This is new.

340
00:15:48,358 --> 00:15:49,559
And I just eat it as is.

341
00:15:50,393 --> 00:15:52,529
-Let's try it that way.
-Sure.

342
00:15:52,596 --> 00:15:54,231
I'll wrap it in a perilla leaf.

343
00:15:54,297 --> 00:15:55,799
Add the cucumber and onion.

344
00:15:55,865 --> 00:15:57,901
And then add the meat.

345
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,172
<i>-And just a bit of </i>ssamjang<i>.</i>
<i>-Got it.</i>

346
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:04,441
ADD A TINY BIT OF <i>SSAMJANG</i>

347
00:16:05,075 --> 00:16:08,211
NAMNO TAKES A BIG BITE OF THE WRAP

348
00:16:09,746 --> 00:16:12,782
THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT

349
00:16:12,849 --> 00:16:13,950
-Like this?
-Okay.

350
00:16:14,684 --> 00:16:15,685
Let's try it.

351
00:16:15,752 --> 00:16:18,121
ORBIT AND DUJUN TRY THE WRAP THEY MADE

352
00:16:18,188 --> 00:16:19,422
YUM

353
00:16:21,358 --> 00:16:23,026
Now you get why I like this.

354
00:16:24,794 --> 00:16:28,431
I feel like the cucumber brings
everything together nicely.

355
00:16:28,498 --> 00:16:30,634
It brings out
the meat and lettuce flavors.

356
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:35,405
You might get sick of eating pork belly
when it gets too greasy.

357
00:16:35,472 --> 00:16:39,109
<i>But the refreshing taste of cucumber</i>
<i>leaves your mouth feeling fresh.</i>

358
00:16:39,175 --> 00:16:40,310
<i>I agree.</i>

359
00:16:40,377 --> 00:16:44,014
THE REFRESHING FLAVOR OF CUCUMBER
BALANCES OUT THE GREASINESS

360
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,150
The kimchi is a must here.

361
00:16:47,217 --> 00:16:48,218
I see.

362
00:16:48,285 --> 00:16:49,953
-Do we grill it?
-Of course.

363
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,087
Grill the kimchi.

364
00:16:51,154 --> 00:16:54,491
PLACES A PIECE OF KIMCHI
ON THE GRILL RIGHT AWAY

365
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:56,726
I'm sorry, ma'am.

366
00:16:56,793 --> 00:16:58,361
WE ASKED FOR PERMISSION TO DO IT

367
00:16:58,428 --> 00:17:01,398
-The owners absolutely hate this.
-Exactly.

368
00:17:08,438 --> 00:17:11,441
<i>Now is the perfect time</i>
<i>to grill the kimchi.</i>

369
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:15,111
Some people put it on the grill
before it's properly heated.

370
00:17:15,178 --> 00:17:17,314
Then there's no Maillard reaction.

371
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,083
If the grill loses heat,
the meat doesn't cook properly.

372
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,484
-That's right.
-I see.

373
00:17:21,551 --> 00:17:23,420
<i>So, start grilling it after the meat.</i>

374
00:17:23,486 --> 00:17:27,524
<i>The kimchi cooks best</i>
<i>when the grill is nicely coated with oil.</i>

375
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:30,794
THE SECRET TO THE FLAVOR
IS HAVING THE MEAT WITH KIMCHI

376
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,031
IT SMELLS INSANE

377
00:17:38,835 --> 00:17:40,303
It's out of this world.

378
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,373
TRYING IT WITH THE GRILLED KIMCHI

379
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:49,079
A PERFECT HARMONY OF FLAVORS
BURSTS IN YOUR MOUTH

380
00:17:49,145 --> 00:17:52,716
NAMNO WRAPS THE PORK BELLY WITH KIMCHI
AND TAKES A BITE

381
00:17:52,782 --> 00:17:55,852
THIS IS IT

382
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,956
Pork belly and kimchi
complement each other perfectly.

383
00:18:00,023 --> 00:18:02,826
-Definitely.
-It's nicely balanced.

384
00:18:03,193 --> 00:18:07,364
It's scrumptious.
It's super salty and sweet.

385
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,132
Let me tell you about this kimchi.

386
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:14,004
They make this two to three times a year
here at the restaurant.

387
00:18:14,537 --> 00:18:16,773
I come here to visit sometimes,

388
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,942
and I watch them make kimchi.

389
00:18:19,009 --> 00:18:20,610
I even help them out.

390
00:18:20,677 --> 00:18:22,812
I get some kimchi after helping them.

391
00:18:23,747 --> 00:18:25,949
-Do they always share with those who help?
-Yes.

392
00:18:26,016 --> 00:18:27,617
-Will you come?
-Absolutely.

393
00:18:30,287 --> 00:18:33,690
AGED KIMCHI IS NICELY GRILLED
IN PORK GREASE

394
00:18:35,492 --> 00:18:40,430
THE PERFECT COMBINATION
OF WELL-GRILLED KIMCHI AND PORK BELLY

395
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:47,404
-I'm good at grilling, right?
-Yes, you are.

396
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,439
You're a master at grilling.

397
00:18:49,506 --> 00:18:52,809
And I can't get enough of this meat.

398
00:18:52,876 --> 00:18:54,711
OBSESSED WITH THE MEAT AND KIMCHI

399
00:18:55,912 --> 00:19:00,984
WRAPPING THE SIDE DISHES
WITH PERILLA LEAF AGAIN

400
00:19:01,051 --> 00:19:03,320
THIS IS THE REAL DEAL

401
00:19:03,386 --> 00:19:04,387
Wow, it's yummy.

402
00:19:04,454 --> 00:19:07,357
I don't get tired of eating
since there are various side dishes.

403
00:19:07,424 --> 00:19:09,226
-You're absolutely right.
-Yes.

404
00:19:09,292 --> 00:19:13,063
CAN'T STOP EATING THE SIDE DISHES

405
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,165
I'm really loving this.

406
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,803
INSANELY DELICIOUS

407
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:23,640
THE PORK BELLY IS COMPLETELY EATEN UP

408
00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:26,877
Shall we move on to the next course?

409
00:19:27,477 --> 00:19:29,079
What's the next course?

410
00:19:29,145 --> 00:19:30,180
WHAT'S NEXT?

411
00:19:30,747 --> 00:19:32,115
-Ma'am.
-Yes.

412
00:19:32,716 --> 00:19:36,052
-Can we please get the next dish?
-Sure.

413
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:38,755
-The next dish is soybean paste stew.
-Oh, yes.

414
00:19:38,822 --> 00:19:42,559
-Is that famous here?
-Definitely.

415
00:19:43,226 --> 00:19:45,862
The side dishes
are absolutely scrumptious.

416
00:19:47,063 --> 00:19:48,298
It tastes fantastic.

417
00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:51,801
The water parsley, chive,
and carrot go well together.

418
00:19:51,868 --> 00:19:53,336
-Dang, look at that.
-Hold on.

419
00:19:53,403 --> 00:19:56,973
Chef Taehoon already knows
we serve this in a hot pot.

420
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,442
-Not in an earthen pot?
-No, it's in a hot pot.

421
00:20:01,144 --> 00:20:04,681
SOYBEAN PASTE STEW IS SERVED IN A HOT POT

422
00:20:04,748 --> 00:20:08,151
VARIOUS VEGGIES ARE ADDED
TO THE PRE-BOILED BROTH

423
00:20:10,887 --> 00:20:13,490
-Whoa, what's this?
-We get large bowls.

424
00:20:13,557 --> 00:20:17,561
-Wow, there's a fried egg.
-Are we having bibimbap?

425
00:20:17,627 --> 00:20:19,496
We can add all the side dishes here.

426
00:20:21,097 --> 00:20:22,532
Wow, this is unreal.

427
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:26,269
-She just made the fried eggs.
-I think she just cooked it.

428
00:20:26,937 --> 00:20:30,807
MAKING THE FRIED EGG AFTER IT'S ORDERED

429
00:20:32,742 --> 00:20:33,810
MIX IT WITH SIDE DISHES

430
00:20:33,877 --> 00:20:36,012
LETTUCE AND SESAME SEEDS,
PERFECT FOR BIBIMBAP

431
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:39,049
-Is it usually served like this?
-Yes, if you order the set menu.

432
00:20:39,115 --> 00:20:42,819
If you order the set menu,
it's served like this.

433
00:20:42,886 --> 00:20:44,921
If you want to order stew
after pork belly,

434
00:20:44,988 --> 00:20:47,624
-it's also served in a hot pot.
-Got it.

435
00:20:47,691 --> 00:20:50,961
<i>Since the office workers are busy,</i>
<i>they eat their lunch quickly.</i>

436
00:20:51,027 --> 00:20:53,463
<i>-They eat it up fast.</i>
<i>-This is great.</i>

437
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,065
<i>We're treated to a nice meal.</i>

438
00:20:55,131 --> 00:20:56,266
A FULL HOT POT

439
00:20:56,333 --> 00:21:01,071
Don't you sometimes put wild chives
in this soybean paste stew?

440
00:21:01,137 --> 00:21:03,306
-Yes, it changes by season.
-Amazing.

441
00:21:03,373 --> 00:21:05,108
-Seasonal greens.
-Shepherd's purse.

442
00:21:05,175 --> 00:21:06,610
-Wow, in the spring?
-Right.

443
00:21:06,676 --> 00:21:08,478
It varies from season to season.

444
00:21:08,545 --> 00:21:10,947
<i>Sometimes, it's shepherd's purse</i>
<i>or wild chive.</i>

445
00:21:11,014 --> 00:21:12,449
<i>Sometimes it's crown daisy.</i>

446
00:21:12,515 --> 00:21:13,884
<i>That's awesome.</i>

447
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:16,686
-The fragrance fills the air.
-Yes, the fragrance.

448
00:21:18,889 --> 00:21:22,826
-Now it's time to try this stew.
-It looks mouth-watering.

449
00:21:22,893 --> 00:21:25,729
-You try it first.
-No, it's all right. Elders go first.

450
00:21:25,795 --> 00:21:26,930
It's all right.

451
00:21:27,964 --> 00:21:30,033
Dang, look at that.

452
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,902
Serving this with care…

453
00:21:33,536 --> 00:21:35,705
Wow, thank you.

454
00:21:35,772 --> 00:21:36,840
Here you go.

455
00:21:36,907 --> 00:21:38,842
-I'm excited to try this.
-Thank you.

456
00:21:40,744 --> 00:21:42,045
THE SECOND COURSE

457
00:21:42,112 --> 00:21:45,549
WHAT WILL THE CLEAR
SOYBEAN PASTE STEW TASTE LIKE?

458
00:21:49,052 --> 00:21:50,053
WOW

459
00:21:51,655 --> 00:21:54,524
Whoa, it's light and tasty.

460
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,994
How is it, Namno?

461
00:21:59,062 --> 00:22:00,564
It's different from other places.

462
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,232
-Really?
-It's completely different.

463
00:22:03,466 --> 00:22:05,902
It's on another level.

464
00:22:05,969 --> 00:22:08,238
-It's not store-bought soybean paste.
-Right.

465
00:22:08,305 --> 00:22:11,741
-Wow, the broth is clear.
-I've never had anything like this.

466
00:22:11,808 --> 00:22:14,211
It has a clean yet deep flavor.
It's interesting.

467
00:22:15,378 --> 00:22:17,147
It's like a mountain spring.

468
00:22:17,214 --> 00:22:19,983
-Wow, it's incredible.
-This is the stuff.

469
00:22:21,117 --> 00:22:23,353
It's rich in flavor.

470
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,156
Sometimes, people add
too much soybean paste like <i>jjageuri</i>,

471
00:22:26,223 --> 00:22:27,691
-which makes it thick.
-Right.

472
00:22:27,757 --> 00:22:31,628
But there's plenty of broth in this,
so it's not heavy.

473
00:22:31,695 --> 00:22:33,830
<i>-It's unbelievably good.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>

474
00:22:35,532 --> 00:22:41,037
We usually have rice
with soybean paste stew at home.

475
00:22:41,104 --> 00:22:43,673
-So, the stew is normally a bit salty.
-Yes.

476
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,910
-But this stew is perfectly seasoned.
-It's not salty at all.

477
00:22:46,977 --> 00:22:48,078
It's good on its own.

478
00:22:48,845 --> 00:22:52,349
SLURPS

479
00:22:52,415 --> 00:22:54,417
I know everything that goes on
around here.

480
00:22:54,484 --> 00:22:55,485
Go to the rooftop.

481
00:22:56,052 --> 00:22:58,655
You can see that they make
the soybean paste themselves.

482
00:22:58,722 --> 00:23:01,324
<i>There have earthenware jars up there.</i>

483
00:23:01,391 --> 00:23:02,859
<i>They make the paste once a year.</i>

484
00:23:02,926 --> 00:23:05,128
HOMEMADE SOYBEAN PASTE MADE ONCE A YEAR

485
00:23:07,063 --> 00:23:08,531
DEEP AROMA FULL OF UMAMI

486
00:23:08,598 --> 00:23:10,533
<i>And when they make the stew,</i>

487
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,837
not only do they use pork,
but ground beef as well.

488
00:23:13,904 --> 00:23:15,739
-Really?
-Is it inside?

489
00:23:16,406 --> 00:23:19,175
ADDS PLENTY OF GROUND BEEF

490
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:23,547
LETS IT SIMMER FOR A LONG TIME

491
00:23:23,613 --> 00:23:25,582
The umami comes from using lots of meat.

492
00:23:25,649 --> 00:23:27,317
Oleic acid boosts the umami.

493
00:23:27,384 --> 00:23:30,086
-What acid?
-Oleic acid. It's in meat.

494
00:23:30,153 --> 00:23:33,023
OLEIC ACID BLENDS IN
TO BOOST THE BROTH'S UMAMI FLAVOR

495
00:23:34,224 --> 00:23:38,728
<i>When they add more protein</i>
<i>to the soybean paste stew,</i>

496
00:23:38,795 --> 00:23:39,996
the fat will seep out.

497
00:23:40,063 --> 00:23:41,598
-Of course, it's tasty.
-Right.

498
00:23:41,665 --> 00:23:44,534
-You don't have to do anything.
-He explains the science well.

499
00:23:44,601 --> 00:23:46,803
He learned from Orbit
in this brief moment.

500
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:49,472
-He's a science communicator.
-They work well together.

501
00:23:49,539 --> 00:23:50,707
He learned from you.

502
00:23:50,774 --> 00:23:52,375
I knew this beforehand.

503
00:23:52,442 --> 00:23:54,211
THE SCIENCE COMMUNICATOR OF THE SHOW

504
00:23:55,245 --> 00:23:57,080
ADDS CHILI POWDER IN THE BEEF BROTH

505
00:23:59,716 --> 00:24:04,487
CHOPS THE POTATOES INTO LARGE PIECES
AND ADDS THEM TO THE BROTH

506
00:24:05,589 --> 00:24:08,992
<i>Ma'am, do you boil the stew</i>
<i>for about four hours?</i>

507
00:24:09,593 --> 00:24:11,027
<i>You boil it for three hours.</i>

508
00:24:11,828 --> 00:24:15,198
<i>-Wow, that's a long time.</i>
<i>-They work hard.</i>

509
00:24:15,265 --> 00:24:17,667
RICH AND CLEAR SOYBEAN PASTE STEW IS READY

510
00:24:17,734 --> 00:24:19,469
-Shall we make bibimbap?
-Sure.

511
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:23,406
MIX RICE AND VEGGIES TOGETHER

512
00:24:24,007 --> 00:24:26,810
First, I'll throw this in.

513
00:24:26,877 --> 00:24:29,279
-Oh, your favorite side dish.
-Exactly.

514
00:24:29,346 --> 00:24:31,548
ADDS THE SEASONED WATER PARSLEY AND CHIVE

515
00:24:31,615 --> 00:24:35,719
And then I'll put in
the young radish kimchi for texture.

516
00:24:36,786 --> 00:24:39,055
Make sure to add this.

517
00:24:39,122 --> 00:24:41,691
And seasoned bean sprouts are a must.

518
00:24:41,758 --> 00:24:43,560
CRUNCHY SEASONED BEAN SPROUTS

519
00:24:43,627 --> 00:24:46,296
Put in some spicy radish salad,
and then mix it.

520
00:24:46,363 --> 00:24:49,065
Can I add some leftover meat?

521
00:24:49,132 --> 00:24:51,334
Please cut some up for me.

522
00:24:51,401 --> 00:24:53,003
I'm adding it because I love it.

523
00:24:53,069 --> 00:24:55,839
Wait, you can just…

524
00:24:56,206 --> 00:24:58,308
-Oh, you're cutting it into strips.
-Yes.

525
00:24:59,042 --> 00:25:00,644
Wait a second.

526
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:03,413
You two are close friends, right?

527
00:25:04,047 --> 00:25:06,783
-This is hilarious.
-They don't get along well.

528
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:09,619
-Stop it. I'll give you all of it.
-Okay.

529
00:25:09,686 --> 00:25:12,088
-You need this for texture.
-Absolutely.

530
00:25:13,156 --> 00:25:15,292
And something else to boost the flavor.

531
00:25:15,358 --> 00:25:16,893
-Gochujang.
-Right.

532
00:25:17,761 --> 00:25:19,629
A SPOONFUL OF GOCHUJANG

533
00:25:19,696 --> 00:25:22,532
<i>I also want to add a bit of the broth.</i>

534
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:25,101
<i>-Look at the potatoes.</i>
<i>-He's adding some moisture.</i>

535
00:25:25,168 --> 00:25:27,304
DON'T FORGET TO ADD THE SOYBEAN PASTE STEW

536
00:25:27,871 --> 00:25:31,141
MIX

537
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,911
ORBIT'S BIBIMBAP IS READY

538
00:25:34,978 --> 00:25:36,646
<i>I'll go ahead and try this.</i>

539
00:25:37,247 --> 00:25:41,017
TAKING A BITE

540
00:25:42,052 --> 00:25:43,386
The texture is different.

541
00:25:43,453 --> 00:25:44,721
Let me try it.

542
00:25:44,788 --> 00:25:46,623
Try this part. It's nicely mixed.

543
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:47,958
Is there sesame oil?

544
00:25:48,024 --> 00:25:52,662
TAEHOON TAKES A HUGE BITE

545
00:25:52,729 --> 00:25:54,397
That's exactly how I would make it.

546
00:25:56,666 --> 00:25:58,401
-Is it the same?
-Yes.

547
00:25:59,069 --> 00:26:00,837
I want to try this part.

548
00:26:01,838 --> 00:26:04,474
I have a spoonful of potatoes and rice.

549
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:05,775
Two types of carbs.

550
00:26:05,842 --> 00:26:08,278
It's like having <i>kalguksu </i>with potatoes.

551
00:26:08,345 --> 00:26:10,447
A SPOONFUL OF TWO TYPES OF CARBS

552
00:26:10,513 --> 00:26:13,416
IT'S YUMMY

553
00:26:13,483 --> 00:26:17,120
<i>I bet tons of people come</i>
<i>to eat this for lunch.</i>

554
00:26:17,187 --> 00:26:18,788
THE EPITOME OF TASTY SIDE DISHES

555
00:26:18,855 --> 00:26:21,091
-Let's dig in.
-Absolutely.

556
00:26:24,127 --> 00:26:25,161
It's so good.

557
00:26:25,228 --> 00:26:27,430
TAEHOON TAKES A BIG BITE

558
00:26:27,497 --> 00:26:29,099
THIS IS THE STUFF

559
00:26:29,165 --> 00:26:30,267
Try this.

560
00:26:31,034 --> 00:26:33,370
-Shall I give you more rice?
-Sure.

561
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:36,373
AS HE IS ABOUT TO TAKE A BIG SPOONFUL…

562
00:26:36,439 --> 00:26:37,440
That's interesting.

563
00:26:38,408 --> 00:26:40,010
-I took all of the egg.
-Oh, no.

564
00:26:41,344 --> 00:26:42,779
THE EGG FELL IN NAMNO'S BOWL

565
00:26:42,846 --> 00:26:44,247
Did you see that just now?

566
00:26:44,781 --> 00:26:46,349
-Did you do that on purpose?
-What?

567
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:49,319
-Hey, it's just an egg.
-He was sneaky.

568
00:26:49,386 --> 00:26:51,054
But the egg is the key here.

569
00:26:51,121 --> 00:26:52,155
IT'S MINE

570
00:26:52,222 --> 00:26:53,757
There are no eggs now.

571
00:26:58,328 --> 00:27:00,830
<i>-I brought you to Daebokjip.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

572
00:27:01,765 --> 00:27:02,766
How was it?

573
00:27:03,466 --> 00:27:05,001
-I'm very happy.
-Really?

574
00:27:05,735 --> 00:27:07,904
Can I enjoy this luxury?

575
00:27:07,971 --> 00:27:09,005
Of course you can.

576
00:27:10,073 --> 00:27:12,943
I've never talked as little
about science as I did today.

577
00:27:13,777 --> 00:27:15,478
-That was little?
-You talked all day.

578
00:27:15,545 --> 00:27:17,214
-Really?
-Yes.

579
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,882
But I only sat here and ate.

580
00:27:20,884 --> 00:27:24,387
Anyway, the more information we have,

581
00:27:24,454 --> 00:27:27,290
the more varied our emotions become.

582
00:27:27,357 --> 00:27:30,827
For instance, our two chefs,
Taehoon and Namno,

583
00:27:30,894 --> 00:27:33,396
-will explain the food to us.
-Yes.

584
00:27:33,463 --> 00:27:37,367
Then, the food tastes different
after learning about new things.

585
00:27:37,434 --> 00:27:40,837
The viewers will understand
what we talked about on the show

586
00:27:40,904 --> 00:27:44,708
when they come here to try the food.

587
00:27:44,774 --> 00:27:47,911
-I loved this. It was truly healing.
-I'm glad you liked it.

588
00:27:47,978 --> 00:27:50,614
I enjoy watching Orbit's show,

589
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,949
but I've never seen him like this before.

590
00:27:53,016 --> 00:27:55,051
Yes, I didn't talk while eating.

591
00:27:55,118 --> 00:27:56,319
That's impossible.

592
00:27:58,188 --> 00:28:01,491
When I go to pork belly restaurants,

593
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:05,896
I pay attention to the side dishes,
like soybean paste stew and cold noodles.

594
00:28:05,962 --> 00:28:08,632
I think meat is pretty much
the same anywhere.

595
00:28:08,698 --> 00:28:12,302
But honestly, and I'm sorry to say this
at a barbecue restaurant,

596
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:15,605
-but the side dishes were enough for me.
-I agree.

597
00:28:15,672 --> 00:28:17,374
And the stew was awesome.

598
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,745
His idea of a good restaurant
matches mine exactly.

599
00:28:21,811 --> 00:28:23,280
-Really?
-Yes.

600
00:28:23,346 --> 00:28:24,848
The meat is important,

601
00:28:24,915 --> 00:28:28,418
but I think the combination
with the side dishes matters a lot.

602
00:28:28,485 --> 00:28:30,820
So, this place is outstanding.

603
00:28:30,887 --> 00:28:33,056
Not only is it a long-standing place,

604
00:28:33,123 --> 00:28:39,329
but I also love it when the owner
and staff welcome me warmly.

605
00:28:39,396 --> 00:28:42,032
Oh, the people are important to you.

606
00:28:42,098 --> 00:28:46,336
-Not only the quality of the food…
-The people matter as well.

607
00:28:46,403 --> 00:28:47,604
You can feel their warmth.

608
00:28:48,772 --> 00:28:51,641
That's why this is my go-to place.

609
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:54,611
-The people make you comfortable here.
-That's right.

610
00:28:54,678 --> 00:28:56,846
-And the food is great, of course.
-Definitely.

611
00:28:56,913 --> 00:28:59,049
I'm glad that you enjoyed the food.

612
00:28:59,115 --> 00:29:00,951
-It was delicious.
-I'm happy.

613
00:29:01,017 --> 00:29:02,085
Thank you for the food.

614
00:29:02,986 --> 00:29:03,987
Thank you.

615
00:29:07,757 --> 00:29:11,461
