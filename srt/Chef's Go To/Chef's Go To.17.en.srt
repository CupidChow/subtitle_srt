<i>-Are we in Gwangjin-gu?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

11
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:24,324
Okay, we will be meeting today's chef.

12
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,426
Who invited today's chef?

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,329
-Isn't it Dujun's or Taehoon's guest?
-Not mine.

14
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:30,430
Me neither.

15
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:31,598
-Who is it?
-Who, then?

16
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:33,500
-Is there no guest today?
-Wait…

17
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:35,903
Do we not have any guests anymore?

18
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,804
A SUSPICIOUS GUY APPROACHES THEM

19
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,807
-Wait…
-Do we have a guest?

20
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,310
Are there bad rumors about our show?

21
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,245
-Peekaboo!
-My goodness!

22
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,181
-Peekaboo!
-My goodness!

23
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,349
You really scared me!

24
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,051
What brings you here?

25
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:53,720
-You came back on the show.
-Ta-da.

26
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,390
<i>Buongiorno</i>, my friend.

27
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:57,991
HE VISITED US FOR EPISODE 11

28
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,227
He's a total Korean.

29
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:01,795
I'm an original Kotalian.

00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:13,707
THE FOODIE BROTHERS
WERE GENUINELY IMPRESSED

35
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:16,577
<i>I've had this dish many times,</i>
<i>but this one's totally new.</i>

36
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,512
Do you like this place?

37
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,047
-Yes.
-It's scrumptious.

38
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:21,248
EVERYONE WAS SATISFIED

39
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:23,984
If you invite me one more time…

40
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:26,119
I'll gladly introduce you to them.

41
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:27,287
HE WANTED TO COME BACK

42
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:32,993
I'm back to share another one
of my go-to spots.

43
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,494
-I'm stunned.
-What's wrong?

44
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,431
-Aren't you happy to see me?
-Of course, we are.

45
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,099
We're delighted to see you.

46
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:42,669
-I used to live in this neighborhood.
-I see.

47
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:46,473
I moved to Guui 3-dong recently.

48
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,775
-Really?
-Yes, I did.

49
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:53,313
-But I lived here until recently.
-You know this area well.

50
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,216
Isn't this wine?

51
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,451
Yes, it is.

52
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:59,486
-Then…
-This is a special gift.

53
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:04,892
This goes really well
with the restaurant we're going to.

54
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,593
-Really?
-Finally.

55
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,828
Lead the way.

56
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:09,129
-Sure.
-Let's go.

57
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:10,464
-This way.
-Off we go.

58
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:13,400
It's Chef Fabri's neighborhood.

59
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,801
-Let me tell you.
-Okay.

60
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:18,672
Guui-dong is such a great neighborhood.

61
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:21,074
There are many restaurants.

62
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,110
-And--
-So, where are we going?

63
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:24,945
-I'm dying to know.
-Me too.

64
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:26,413
He brought wine today.

65
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,249
I think he dropped us a hint.

66
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:32,319
-We have this here as well.
-What is this?

67
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:35,189
-Is it a police station?
-It's a huge one.

68
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,292
<i>It's a safe neighborhood.</i>

69
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,960
There's a fire station nearby.

70
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:42,429
-Is that so?
-And a health center over there.

71
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,332
-There's everything.
-And Konkuk University.

72
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:48,902
-Got it.
-There's also a high school.

73
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:54,408
<i>The restaurant we're going to</i>
<i>is popular among civil servants.</i>

74
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:59,513
-I can't wait.
-It's been here for ten years.

75
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,416
It's been here for ten years,
and civil servants love the food?

76
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,084
That means it's a great place.

77
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:07,688
Guess where it is.

78
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:11,258
-This is a nice business area.
-Wait, "barley rice and grilled fish."

79
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,126
<i>-It's…</i>
<i>-Is this it?</i>

80
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,429
-Yes.
-Is this your go-to place?

81
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,130
-He's right.
-Correct!

82
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,632
-Migadam!
-That's right.

83
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,568
It's right next to the police station.

84
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:24,037
Hold on, is this white wine then?

85
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:26,206
-Absolutely.
-I knew it.

86
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:27,941
-It's great with seafood.
-Right.

87
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:29,510
Let's head inside.

88
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,111
-Go in first.
-Okay.

89
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:34,515
This is not an ordinary place.
There's a <i>jangdokdae </i>outside.

90
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,083
Hello, ma'am!

91
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:39,152

95
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:46,593

-I always sit here.

96
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,063

97
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:51,999
A "GOOD RESTAURANT"

98
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:56,069
<i>It says here that</i>
<i>it's a good restaurant in Gwangjin-gu.</i>

99
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:58,338
<i>How long have you been coming here?</i>

100
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,241
Almost four years now.

101
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,377
-Really?
-Yes, it's been four years.

102
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,580
-Wow, that's amazing.
-I come here often.

103
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:09,983
-But I was in Italy for a month.
-Okay.

104
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,386
So, I really missed the food here.

105
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,188
-Wow, is it that good?
-Really?

106
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,023
-He's Korean.
-It's a local eatery.

107
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,091
-I craved it so much.
-You're a Kotalian.

108
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,293
Yes, I'm a Kotalian.

109
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,694
LOVES KOREAN FOOD

110
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,830
Look at the menu, please.
Aren't you curious?

111
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:26,033
-There's barley rice.
-Right.

112
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,469
A set meal with stir-fried spicy pork
and grilled fish.

113
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:31,839
What dishes do you recommend?

114
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:34,942
-I don't have to order.
-Why not?

115
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,111
Ma'am.

116
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:39,847
Yes, what would you like?

117
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:41,815
-What do you usually get?
-Yes.

118
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,051
What is it?

119
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,253
Chef Fabri comes every Saturday.

120
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:51,024
<i>Sometimes, he comes</i>
<i>with his wife and lovely daughter.</i>

121
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:54,228
<i>And their parents, from both sides,</i>
<i>have come here.</i>

122
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,698
Whenever he goes abroad, he comes here
right after returning to Korea.

123
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,833
-Immediately.
-Before he goes, he says,

124
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,370
"I can't come for a while."
And I ask him why.

125
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:05,405
He always says,
"I'm going abroad tomorrow."

126
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:08,208
He's a true Koren
if he calls Italy "abroad."

127
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,310
KOTALIAN FABRI IS A TRUE KOREAN

128
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,212
Then shall we have his usual…

129
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:15,048
-He eats the grilled fish set meal.
-Okay.

130
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,818
But try the stir-fried spicy pork
set meal as well.

131
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:19,920
Oh, then let's have two of each.

132
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,255
Sure, please wait a moment.

133
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,723
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

134
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,392
-She's very friendly.
-I agree.

135
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:28,161
Isn't this picture amazing?

136
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,597
They are such a loving couple.

137
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,499
I can only come here on Saturdays

138
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:36,436
because the owners
always go hiking on Sundays.

139
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,138
-I see.
-Right?

140
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:39,339
Yes, you're right.

141
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:41,909
-I already knew that.
-I see that they love hiking.

142
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:44,211
THEY CLOSE ON SUNDAYS TO GO HIKING

143
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:45,846
It's ready.

144
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:47,848
Whoa, it's here.

145
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:50,417
Barley rice should be served
in these bowls.

146
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:52,252
There so many side dishes.

147
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,820
These aren't side dishes.

148
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,656
-Do we mix these in?
-Yes.

149
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,591
-Excuse me.
-Is this for the bibimbap?

150
00:05:57,658 --> 00:05:59,226
-Yes.
-They're not side dishes.

151
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:00,961
<i>There are six types of vegetables.</i>

152
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,796
<i>These are sprouts.</i>

153
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,566
<i>These are stir-fried summer squash</i>
<i>and bean sprouts.</i>

154
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:07,701
<i>This is stir-fried oyster mushrooms.</i>

155
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:10,037
<i>-What's this?</i>
<i>-It's spicy radish salad.</i>

156
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,472
<i>-Are these dried radish leaves?</i>
<i>-Yes, exactly.</i>

157
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,642
-It's seasoned with perilla powder.
-That's right.

158
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:16,877
It's mouthwatering.

159
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:20,581
<i>I add perilla powder to the radish leaves</i>
<i>and mushrooms. We make them ourselves.</i>

160
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:22,449
Wow, this is amazing.

161
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:24,518
<i>-This is seasoned soybean paste.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

162
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:26,220
That's homemade as well.

163
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:27,387
-Really?
-Yes.

164
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,123
-This…
-Here you go.

165
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,392
I love this soybean paste.

166
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,727
It's unbelievable.

167
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:35,462
Oh, I can't wait to try it.

168
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,731
<i>We mix it with the barley rice.</i>

169
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:38,899
PERFECTLY COOKED RICE

170
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:42,069
I've never had this with gochujang,

171
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,605
because the seasoned
soybean paste is perfect.

172
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:47,541
-Is that your go-to seasoning?
-Definitely.

173
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:50,644
Wait, the table is still empty,
so does that mean…

174
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:53,046
-The side dishes.
-Oh, they have side dishes.

175
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:54,915
-There's more.
-Look carefully, please.

176
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:56,283
This is the best.

177
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,085
Cucumber and eggplant.

178
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,587
It's seasoned eggplant and cucumber salad.

179
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:02,189
SEASONED EGGPLANT

180
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,959
CUCUMBER SALAD

181
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,095
STIR-FRIED SUMMER SQUASH

182
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,763
<i>This is summer squash.</i>

183
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,932
<i>This is twisted peppers and anchovies.</i>

184
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:13,534
STIR-FRIED PEPPERS AND ANCHOVIES

185
00:07:14,368 --> 00:07:16,637
-Wow, there's green onion kimchi.
-I love it.

186
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:19,606
-These are all incredible.
-This looks great.

187
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:22,242
-Are the dishes always the same?
-They change every day.

188
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:23,310
Every day?

189
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:26,480
<i>-Wow, it's </i>cheonggukjang<i>.</i>
<i>-It sure is.</i>

190
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:27,548
<i>It smells great.</i>

191
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,684
Wow, it smells fantastic.

192
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:32,686
I really love <i>cheonggukjang</i>.

193
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:34,388
I should take a picture of this.

194
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,490
Stir-fried spicy pork and grilled fish.

195
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:38,759
-Take one when they're served.
-All right.

196
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,260
Dang, this is insane.

197
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:43,564
-The table is filled with dishes.
-Thank you.

198
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,966
<i>Whoa, this looks excellent.</i>

199
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:48,035
STIR-FRIED SPICY PORK

200
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,404
<i>It's a whole mackerel, not just half!</i>

201
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,105
<i>Each person gets a whole fish.</i>

202
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:53,574
-Really?
-Yes.

203
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,610
I get them from the market
and prep them myself.

204
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:58,745
Wow, I can't believe it.

205
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,314
We prep 100 fish daily.

206
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,449
-Even the side dishes always change.
-Yes.

207
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:04,785
And you prepare the mackerel
yourself as well.

208
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:06,086
There's no time to rest.

209
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,455
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

210
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:12,159
-Sunday is the only day you rest.
-Right, we go out hiking on Sundays.

211
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,796
-Look at this.
-Wow, this is…

212
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:19,466
It's a work of art. Don't you agree?

213
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:24,938
<i>I think set meals</i>
<i>are the highlight of Korean food.</i>

214
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,474
<i>Foreigners would be surprised to see this.</i>

215
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:32,012
-Definitely, they would be amazed.
-I get really excited.

216
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:34,014
-Isn't this exciting?
-I can't wait.

217
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:38,485
-Do you eat this in a specific order?
-Of course.

218
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:42,089
I start with the refreshing side dishes.

219
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,257
All right.

220
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:45,526
Appetizer. <i>Aperitivo</i>.

221
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,261
<i>-Aperitivo.</i>
-What?

222
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:50,597
In Italy, <i>aperitivo </i>refers to…

223
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:52,499
<i>-Aperitivo.</i>
-Right.

224
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:56,436
It's the kind of food
that stimulates your appetite.

225
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:59,339
-It's yummy.
-We eat appetizers first.

226
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,876
<i>-We're eating cold and tangy dishes first.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

227
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:06,046
-Let's try the anchovies.
-Okay.

228
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,549
YUM

229
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,484
-I'm loving the eggplant.
-Me too.

230
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,319
This is delicious.

231
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:15,722
-Oh, this is tender.
-Wow, it's scrumptious.

232
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,126
These will go wonderfully with rice.

233
00:09:19,193 --> 00:09:20,928
She's an excellent cook.

234
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:25,332
THE SIDE DISHES ARE INCREDIBLE APPETIZERS

235
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,868
Everyone, let's try the barley rice.

236
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:30,137
-Okay.
-You have to mix it well.

237
00:09:30,204 --> 00:09:32,472
-This is my favorite.
-Seasoned soybean paste.

238
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:36,510
-Okay, one, two…
-One, two…

239
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:40,047
-Isn't it too salty?
-Not at all.

240
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:41,915
-You're a true Italian!
-Of course.

241
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,584
We like our food salty.

242
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:46,653
-Italian food is super salty.
-Four scoops.

243
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,556
<i>I added five tablespoons.</i>

244
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:52,059
-Now, I'll…
-What else?

245
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:55,062
That's the seasoned dried radish leaves.

246
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:56,897
It's seasoned with perilla powder.

247
00:09:56,964 --> 00:10:00,334
-Bean sprouts and summer squash.
-Bean sprouts and summer squash.

248
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,803
-Look at the veggies.
-Stir-fried oyster mushrooms.

249
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,238
<i>He's so used to this.</i>

250
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:07,274
And spicy radish salad.

251
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:08,809
-Add this, too.
-Sprouts.

252
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:11,078
-Oh, it looks beautiful.
-Exactly.

253
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,246
EXCITED

254
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,448
Lastly, I drizzle some sesame oil on top.

255
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:18,952
I love the nuttiness.

256
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,154
-A slight touch.
-Right.

257
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:22,923
<i>Just a splash of oil.</i>

258
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,625
ADDS A BIT OF SESAME OIL

259
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,964
MIXES IT ALL UP

260
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,170
Dang, look at this.

261
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:38,505
-Wow, it looks tasty.
-It's super rich.

262
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:41,475
-I think you added too much paste.
-Not at all.

263
00:10:42,276 --> 00:10:45,679
-Wait, are you adding sesame oil first?
-Only sesame oil.

264
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,849
-Really?
-Is that it for seasoning?

265
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,185
-That's right.
-He's pouring a ton of it in.

266
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:53,754
It's like perilla oil buckwheat noodles.

267
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,557
-Wow, I've never seen this.
-My goodness.

268
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,859
<i>-Like </i>aglio e olio<i>.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>

269
00:10:58,926 --> 00:11:00,794
<i>-This is new.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

270
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:03,664
Are you not going to add Korean pecorino?

271
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,499
-That's hilarious.
-No Korean pecorino?

272
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:06,934
Only sesame oil?

273
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,304
-I can add the <i>cheonggukjang</i>.
-Will you mix that in?

274
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,472
I'll only add the tofu from the stew.

275
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:15,042
<i>-Oh, just the tofu.</i>
<i>-That's right.</i>

276
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,878
-And I'll mix it together.
-The sesame oil…

277
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:19,079
<i>For glossiness.</i>

278
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:22,249
<i>Why did you put in so much sesame oil?</i>

279
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,451
SHALL WE DIG IN?

280
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:25,519
Let's try it.

281
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,155
He's a true Korean.

282
00:11:28,222 --> 00:11:31,558
TAKES A BIG BITE OF BARLEY BIBIMBAP

283
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,227
HE'S GETTING GOOSEBUMPS

284
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:34,661
Is it good?

285
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,364
Gosh, it's probably salty.

286
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:39,166
-This is it.
-It's salty.

287
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:42,636
-It's been such a long time.
-It looks like he's crying.

288
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:46,039
-I've been waiting for this moment.
-Is that so?

289
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:48,642
Is it that good? I'm dying to try it.

290
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,178
<i>It's not as salty as you think.</i>

291
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:55,215
<i>-Really?</i>
<i>-It's nutty and rich.</i>

292
00:11:55,616 --> 00:11:56,750
Try it.

293
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:57,918
Can we try it?

294
00:11:57,985 --> 00:12:02,489
THE FOODIE BROTHERS ARE EAGER TO TRY IT

295
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:05,492
WHAT WILL IT TASTE LIKE?

296
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:07,961
-It's not salty.
-I told you.

297
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,364
Wait, no, it's salty.

298
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,633
It's salty.

299
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:14,234
-Is it?
-Yes.

300
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,803
Oh, no. Is it that salty?

301
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:18,772
It's not salty.

302
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,207
IT'S PERFECT FOR FABRI

303
00:12:20,274 --> 00:12:22,943
-It's salty like Western food.
-Hold on, David.

304
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,011
Honestly, it's not.

305
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:27,848
-It's good, but it's a bit salty for me.
-Me too.

306
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:32,052
I guess you two are used to salty food.

307
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,120
SIMILAR TASTES

308
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:35,222
-It's not salty.
-It's perfect.

309
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:37,291
-Let's try mine.
-Sure.

310
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:41,328
-Of course.
-I'll try a spoonful of yours.

311
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:43,697
REPLACES HIS SPOON WITH A NEW ONE

312
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:47,701
I'm suddenly proud of my bibimbap.

313
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:49,670
-Really?
-It tastes super healthy.

314
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,179
-Eating this after that…
-It's feels healthy.

315
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:01,248
Oh, no. Why is it so bland?

316
00:13:01,315 --> 00:13:05,219
I'll add more <i>cheonggukjang</i>
or eat it with the side dishes.

317
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,254
It's a substitute for plain rice.

318
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:09,957
-This is a Korean-style dish.
-I agree.

319
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:13,527
<i>-It goes well with the side dishes.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>

320
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:18,532
Rice and various side dishes are
the essence of Korean cuisine.

321
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:20,234
They make Korean food special.

322
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,470
Do they only serve single dishes in Italy?

323
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:28,342
Yes, we don't have side dishes.
Firstly, we don't share food that often.

324
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:32,513
Each person gets a whole pizza.

325
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:33,981
I see.

326
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,484
-I'll go next.
-It's Taehoon's turn.

327
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:39,887
I'll go with gochujang.

328
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,190
That much?

329
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:44,591
PLENTY OF GOCHUJANG

330
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:46,627
-That's a lot.
-Wait a minute.

331
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:49,563
-He added as much as I did.
-No, but I'll add this, too.

332
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,864
He needs to add more.

333
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:52,833
Do you like salty food? That's a lot.

334
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:54,468
Wait, everyone.

335
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:58,138
<i>-I guess we've all lived a tough life.</i>
<i>-Maybe.</i>

336
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:00,040
Let's see, I'll…

337
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:02,376
-Do you like spicy radish salad?
-Yes.

338
00:14:03,744 --> 00:14:05,746
Wow, that's a great idea.

339
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:07,581
I also add…

340
00:14:07,648 --> 00:14:08,882
It's anchovy bibimbap.

341
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:11,318
ADDS STIR-FRIED ANCHOVIES
AND POURS THE SAUCE ON TOP

342
00:14:11,385 --> 00:14:13,554
-It's sweet and tangy.
-I'm also adding it.

343
00:14:14,755 --> 00:14:16,657
I'll copy what he did.

344
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:19,326
<i>It looks mouthwatering.</i>

345
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:21,228
<i>There are various textures.</i>

346
00:14:21,295 --> 00:14:23,397
<i>It has a hint of sourness.</i>

347
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:26,433
APPETIZING GOCHUJANG BIBIMBAP IS READY

348
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,203
-I'll try it first.
-I'm curious.

349
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:32,806
-This is the stuff.
-Really?

350
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:35,375
<i>This is the classic bibimbap of Korea.</i>

351
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:36,543
This is perfect.

352
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,513
-Why are you so confident?
-Just try it.

353
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,082
-This is better than I thought.
-Right?

354
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,751
Gochujang is a classic.

355
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:46,253
-It's delicious.
-It's yummy.

356
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,689
-It's not salty.
-Is this gochujang not spicy?

357
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:50,357
It's not, Fabri.

358
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:53,894
FABRI IS CURIOUS
ABOUT THE GOCHUJANG FLAVOR

359
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:55,996
IT'S NOT SPICY, RIGHT?

360
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:57,397
-It's not spicy.
-Wait.

361
00:14:57,965 --> 00:15:01,001
-I can taste a fruity flavor.
-Really?

362
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:05,272
Ma'am, this is my first time
trying your gochujang.

363
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:06,874
-Really?
-Yes.

364
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,175
-It's tasty.
-Is that so?

365
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:10,744
Hold on, could there possibly be…

366
00:15:10,811 --> 00:15:12,946
"ANALYZING THE FLAVOR"

367
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:14,681
…green plum syrup in this?

368
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:17,017
Yes, and I make it myself.

369
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:20,020
HOMEMADE GREEN PLUM SYRUP

370
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,722
I can smell the green plum.

371
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:24,224
-There's a bit of acidity.
-Exactly.

372
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,093
I also add something else.

373
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,095
I'm the only one who knows what it is.

374
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:29,630
They don't add it anywhere else.

375
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:36,236
SHE MAKES THE SYRUP HERSELF
AND LETS IT MATURE FOR A YEAR

376
00:15:36,837 --> 00:15:40,240
THE SECRET TO THEIR GOCHUJANG
IS GREEN PLUM SYRUP AND <i>MAKGEOLLI</i>

377
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:44,211
THEIR VERY OWN SPECIAL GOCHUJANG

378
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:52,653
THEY ALSO ADD GREEN PLUM SYRUP
TO THEIR SIDE DISHES TO BOOST UMAMI

379
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:55,789
It's awesome.

380
00:15:55,856 --> 00:16:00,360
I can tell she's an amazing cook because
the side dishes are perfectly seasoned.

381
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:01,628
I agree.

382
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:03,163
I can't stop eating them.

383
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,865
Does everyone like <i>cheonggukjang</i>?

384
00:16:04,932 --> 00:16:06,767
-Of course.
-I love it.

385
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:09,336
<i>People either love it or hate it.</i>

386
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:10,671
<i>Really?</i>

387
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:12,773
It's boiling.

388
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,842
It's like the tofu is dancing.

389
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:16,977
I love <i>cheonggukjang</i>.

390
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:18,545
-Me too.
-It's a favorite.

391
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:19,613
It's fantastic.

392
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,383
As you can see, there's radish inside.

393
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:27,221
<i>-Really?</i>
<i>-Yes, so it tastes very clean.</i>

394
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,022
Oh, it's refreshing.

395
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:30,457
It's refreshing and clean.

396
00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:33,827
SLURPS THE <i>CHEONGGUKJANG</i>

397
00:16:33,894 --> 00:16:35,963
It's super rich, but how do I put this?

398
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:38,298
The reason why people dislike this…

399
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:40,567
-It's subtle.
-It's not as pungent.

400
00:16:40,634 --> 00:16:43,971
Of course, you can obviously smell it,
but it's not heavy.

401
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:46,073
-Definitely.
-I'm obsessed with this.

402
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,041
DUJUN ADDS PLENTY OF STEW TO THE RICE

403
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:52,079
<i>-Are you adding the stew?</i>
<i>-Yes, and the soybean breaks apart easily.</i>

404
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:54,281
This is like <i>cheonggukjang omurice.</i>

405
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:55,649
TOPS IT WITH VEGGIES

406
00:16:55,716 --> 00:16:57,518
<i>-It looks great.</i>
<i>-This is the stuff.</i>

407
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:01,955
Oh, I can't wait.

408
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:05,993
Everyone, take a bite of my version.

409
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:10,731
I think this <i>cheonggukjang</i>
is absolutely delicious.

410
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:12,165
It's unbelievably good.

411
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,037
-I'll take a big bite.
-Sure.

412
00:17:17,738 --> 00:17:20,140
-This is obviously good.
-Absolutely.

413
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,208
YUM

414
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:23,210
I can't get enough of this stew.

415
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,846
It's amazing. Hold on.

416
00:17:25,913 --> 00:17:27,514
-But it's bland.
-Really?

417
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:30,117
Mine and Taehoon's dishes are just right.

418
00:17:30,184 --> 00:17:31,618
Yours and David's are bland.

419
00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:35,022
Honestly, Chef Fabri's bibimbap
was the best.

420
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:37,457
-I agree.
-Personally.

421
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:40,160
Regulars know what is good.

422
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:42,496
Shall we try the mackerel next?

423
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:44,798
-Sure.
-Let's try it.

424
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:49,169
Isn't it cool that
we each get a whole mackerel?

425
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:50,671
They're very generous.

426
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:58,011
THEY PREP 100 FRESH MACKEREL EVERY DAY

427
00:18:00,314 --> 00:18:06,153
ADDS SALT TO THE PREPPED FISH
AND RESTS IT FOR A DAY

428
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:14,494
GRILLS FOR 10 MINUTES SO THE OIL SEEPS OUT

429
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:21,168
GOLDEN BROWN

430
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:26,507
GRILLED SALTED MACKEREL,
CRISPY OUTSIDE AND JUICY INSIDE

431
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:28,742
Let's split it evenly in half.

432
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:30,410
-Don't debone my side.
-Okay.

433
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:33,780
Chef, help yourself.
It's been a while since you've had this.

434
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,951
Here you go.

435
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:40,821
DAVID GIVES HIM A BIG PIECE

436
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:43,457
-Wow, the mackerel is amazing.
-Really?

437
00:18:43,524 --> 00:18:44,525
Take the larger half.

438
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:47,261
Thank you.

439
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:48,562
CRISPY PART

440
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:50,764
WOW

441
00:18:50,831 --> 00:18:53,367
This is the crunchy part.

442
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:55,636
-It's like mackerel chips.
-Exactly.

443
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:01,909
DEVOURING THE GRILLED MACKEREL

444
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,044
The belly of the mackerel is the best.

445
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:06,647
Yes, I agree.

446
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:07,781
TAKES A BITE

447
00:19:07,848 --> 00:19:09,416
Oh, I love fish.

448
00:19:12,286 --> 00:19:14,588
-Isn't it delicious?
-Yes.

449
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:16,223
<i>And the…</i>

450
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,591
THE MACKEREL SKIN IS CRISPY

451
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:19,493
<i>The skin is extremely crispy.</i>

452
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,362
This is incredible. It's my favorite part.

453
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:26,166
It isn't too salty, either.

454
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:27,668
Right, it's lightly salted.

455
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:28,936
It's seasoned just right.

456
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:34,808
Salted mackerel is usually very salty,
but this isn't that salty.

457
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:36,944
It has a mild flavor.

458
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,312
I'm addicted to the skin.

459
00:19:39,146 --> 00:19:40,214
We're gobbling this up.

460
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,715
EATS IT STRAIGHT FROM THE BONE

461
00:19:41,782 --> 00:19:43,450
-This is…
-It's so good.

462
00:19:44,084 --> 00:19:45,185
Help yourself.

463
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:46,420
Wow, if it's this good…

464
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:48,488
I could come every day.

465
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:51,391
QUIETLY ENJOYING THE MACKEREL

466
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:53,794
YUM

467
00:19:54,795 --> 00:19:55,996
Breathe.

468
00:19:56,897 --> 00:19:59,333
-Look at him.
-Dang, how do I put this?

469
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:01,802
<i>It's just the right amount of fat.</i>

470
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:05,272
-It's moist and very light. It's great.
-It's tasty.

471
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:08,375
ADDICTED TO MACKEREL
USES BOTH HANDS TO EAT IT

472
00:20:08,442 --> 00:20:10,077
<i>Take a piece of kimchi.</i>

473
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:11,645
GREEN ONION KIMCHI PAIRS WELL

474
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:16,750
WRAPS THE BARLEY RICE IN KIMCHI

475
00:20:16,817 --> 00:20:18,252
<i>And a piece of mackerel.</i>

476
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:20,153
<i>Like this.</i>

477
00:20:20,988 --> 00:20:26,460
This is what I'm talking about. Oh, wait.

478
00:20:26,527 --> 00:20:29,263
-Don't forget the green onion kimchi.
-Okay.

479
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:31,365
It's a must.

480
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:35,002
FABRI ADDS GREEN ONION KIMCHI

481
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,671
Oh, yes. It's ready.

482
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:39,439
Do you think I can eat it one bite?

483
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:40,607
I don't know.

484
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:42,676
TAKES A HUGE BITE

485
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:44,311
Wow, it's unbelievable.

486
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:48,515
-The green onion kimchi is awesome.
-Really?

487
00:20:50,017 --> 00:20:52,786
-I should try it since you say so.
-It's insane.

488
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:57,891
SPICY GREEN ONION KIMCHI
REFRESHES YOUR PALATE

489
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,560
This kimchi is irresistible.

490
00:21:01,662 --> 00:21:03,730
EVERYONE DEVOURS THE FOOD

491
00:21:04,164 --> 00:21:05,165
Everyone.

492
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:08,035
GULPING IT DOWN

493
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:11,638
Do you agree that
the food here is amazing?

494
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:13,841
-Of course.
-Definitely.

495
00:21:13,907 --> 00:21:16,710
I'm almost done with mine.

496
00:21:17,578 --> 00:21:20,280
It's time to add <i>cheonggukjang</i>.

497
00:21:20,347 --> 00:21:23,784
If you add stew to that,
it's going to be super salty.

498
00:21:23,851 --> 00:21:26,086
-Right.
-No way.

499
00:21:26,153 --> 00:21:27,955
Don't worry.

500
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:32,192
-It won't be salty.
-I can't believe it.

501
00:21:33,093 --> 00:21:34,294
It'll be delicious.

502
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:37,264
THE REGULAR ASSURES YOU IT'S GOOD

503
00:21:37,998 --> 00:21:39,433
YUM

504
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:40,501
It's not salty.

505
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:41,902
Absolutely.

506
00:21:42,603 --> 00:21:44,271
Let's try the stir-fried spicy pork.

507
00:21:44,338 --> 00:21:48,342
-I haven't had this in a while.
-I see.

508
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:51,678
I specialize in seafood,
so I usually opt for the seafood.

509
00:21:51,745 --> 00:21:53,747
TIME TO TRY THE PORK THE OWNER RECOMMENDED

510
00:21:58,385 --> 00:22:00,921
Wow, it's super tender.

511
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:03,891
-Dang, they're amazing cooks.
-I agree.

512
00:22:03,957 --> 00:22:07,728
USES THE CHEWY AND TENDER
PORK NECK SHOULDER

513
00:22:09,196 --> 00:22:13,967
THE STIR-FRIED SPICY PORK
HAS A SMOKY FLAVOR

514
00:22:14,635 --> 00:22:18,038
IT'S SWEET AND SALTY,
EVERYONE WILL LOVE THIS

515
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:21,608
<i>This isn't spicy at all.</i>

516
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:23,777
<i>-It's just how I like it.</i>
<i>-It's mildly spicy.</i>

517
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:26,780
-Isn't it good?
-Yes, it's excellent.

518
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:28,115
CAN'T STOP EATING

519
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:30,651
So many dishes,
yet I'm enjoying every single one.

520
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:32,052
I'm eating nonstop.

521
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:35,022
And the barley rice
is easy on the stomach.

522
00:22:35,088 --> 00:22:37,391
Since the side dishes change every day,

523
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:39,626
I bet the civil servants love this spot.

524
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:41,028
Oh, now I get it.

525
00:22:41,094 --> 00:22:45,966
That's why this restaurant is so popular.

526
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:47,501
You don't get tired of this.

527
00:22:47,568 --> 00:22:50,871
Can I… order another mackerel?

528
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:52,706
-Is it possible?
-Yes.

529
00:22:52,773 --> 00:22:56,710
Ma'am, can we please have
two more mackerel?

530
00:22:56,777 --> 00:23:02,816
It needs to be paired
with a special drink.

531
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:03,884
Right.

532
00:23:06,153 --> 00:23:10,090
It's incredibly nice, right?

533
00:23:10,157 --> 00:23:12,793
TAEHOON EVEN WANTS THE BONES
OF FABRI AND DUJUN'S MACKEREL

534
00:23:19,032 --> 00:23:21,034
OVERJOYED

535
00:23:21,101 --> 00:23:22,102
Nice.

536
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,137
Good.

537
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:26,540
You know how to eat that.

538
00:23:26,607 --> 00:23:28,575
-This is how you eat fish.
-He's like a cat.

539
00:23:29,142 --> 00:23:30,143
That's hilarious.

540
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,812
I'M OBSESSED WITH THIS

541
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:33,347
Here's some more mackerel.

542
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:34,648
GRILLED RIGHT AWAY

543
00:23:34,715 --> 00:23:36,483
-This is insane.
-Thank you, ma'am.

544
00:23:38,151 --> 00:23:39,486
It's here.

545
00:23:39,553 --> 00:23:41,288
-It's time.
-Enjoy.

546
00:23:41,355 --> 00:23:44,358
It's finally time to drink wine.

547
00:23:44,725 --> 00:23:46,326
Here it is.

548
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:48,996
What kind of wine is it?

549
00:23:49,062 --> 00:23:50,964
I brought white wine.

550
00:23:51,031 --> 00:23:54,067
-Okay.
-It's from Northern Italy.

551
00:23:54,134 --> 00:23:56,937
It's an incredible Chardonnay wine.

552
00:23:57,004 --> 00:24:00,140
THE QUEEN OF WHITE WINE
WITH A SMOOTH AND RICH BODY

553
00:24:00,207 --> 00:24:03,010
-Hands up, then hands down.
-That's it.

554
00:24:04,144 --> 00:24:05,412
-Pop!
-Pop.

555
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:07,281
Yay, congratulations!

556
00:24:07,347 --> 00:24:10,050
There's a reason I chose this wine.

557
00:24:10,117 --> 00:24:16,657
<i>Wine with high acidity and a fruity taste</i>

558
00:24:16,723 --> 00:24:19,660
<i>pairs perfectly with Korean food.</i>

559
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:20,928
Thank you.

560
00:24:20,994 --> 00:24:22,829
CELEBRATING THEIR SECOND GATHERING

561
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:23,931
Thanks.

562
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:28,435
Thank you.

563
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:32,439
-Its golden color is beautiful.
-Smell the aroma.

564
00:24:32,506 --> 00:24:35,676
-You've chosen two great restaurants.
-It smells great.

565
00:24:35,742 --> 00:24:37,244
Thank you for sharing them.

566
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:38,812
-Thank you.
-Cheers.

567
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:40,314
CHEERS TO HIS GO-TO SPOT

568
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:42,983
SLURP

569
00:24:44,518 --> 00:24:46,687
SAVORS IT FOR A LONG TIME

570
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:50,924
-Now we're talking.
-Oh, it's smooth.

571
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:52,860
It cleanses…

572
00:24:52,926 --> 00:24:54,928
-It refreshes your palate.
-Exactly.

573
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:56,563
It resets your palate.

574
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:59,566
-Try the mackerel again.
-Got it.

575
00:24:59,633 --> 00:25:01,635
-It's a restart.
-Of course.

576
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:04,171
-Let's eat the mackerel.
-Now I get it.

577
00:25:04,238 --> 00:25:07,374
It really clears the taste buds
after eating stew and pork.

578
00:25:07,441 --> 00:25:08,509
It's refreshing.

579
00:25:08,575 --> 00:25:10,210
Split it in half.

580
00:25:10,277 --> 00:25:11,945
I'll eat the side with the bones.

581
00:25:13,747 --> 00:25:15,549
I'm sorry, mackerel.

582
00:25:16,483 --> 00:25:18,752
EATS IT RIGHT OFF THE FISH

583
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:20,821
It glistens nicely.

584
00:25:23,457 --> 00:25:24,725
This is the stuff.

585
00:25:25,926 --> 00:25:29,196
ENJOYING MACKEREL AGAIN
LIKE IT'S THEIR FIRST TIME

586
00:25:29,263 --> 00:25:32,566
It's a bit greasy after eating this

587
00:25:32,633 --> 00:25:35,202
-because it's very oily.
-Right.

588
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:36,336
-Take a sip.
-Of course.

589
00:25:36,403 --> 00:25:37,804
JUST WHEN YOU NEED A REFRESHER

590
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:39,773
<i>-Salute.</i>
<i>-Salute.</i>

591
00:25:40,807 --> 00:25:42,042
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

592
00:25:48,515 --> 00:25:50,284
It's another restart.

593
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,919
It resets your palate.

594
00:25:51,985 --> 00:25:54,021
It complements the dish nicely.

595
00:25:54,087 --> 00:25:58,125
I think I can eat
two more mackerel with this wine.

596
00:25:58,792 --> 00:26:01,094
-I'm serious.
-Taehoon.

597
00:26:01,161 --> 00:26:04,164
Didn't you say
you only drink one type of wine?

598
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:06,099
-Only Pinot Noir.
-Pinot Noir?

599
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:09,403
Really? But is it from Italy?

600
00:26:09,469 --> 00:26:11,371
Or is it from France?

601
00:26:11,438 --> 00:26:13,006
ITALIAN WINE OR FRENCH WINE

602
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:14,074
From Burgundy.

603
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:18,612
You're a bad… bad person.

604
00:26:20,347 --> 00:26:22,950
-"Bad person."
-A very bad person.

605
00:26:23,016 --> 00:26:24,218
Don't get me wrong.

606
00:26:24,484 --> 00:26:27,187
When I first started drinking wine,

607
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:29,823
I was introduced to French wine.

608
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:33,727
I'm not okay with that.

609
00:26:33,794 --> 00:26:36,029
That's unacceptable.

610
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:38,532
Because, as an Italian,

611
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:43,570
coffee and wine just run through my veins.

612
00:26:43,637 --> 00:26:45,606
HE'S SERIOUS ABOUT COFFEE AND WINE

613
00:26:45,672 --> 00:26:48,475
Fabri, after drinking a glass of this,

614
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:50,944
I think I'll be drinking more
of this Italian wine.

615
00:26:51,011 --> 00:26:52,212
Okay, great.

616
00:26:53,881 --> 00:26:55,349
<i>Salute.</i>

617
00:26:55,415 --> 00:26:57,918
WINE FROM ITALY IS THE BEST

618
00:27:00,754 --> 00:27:02,589
Thank you so much for today.

619
00:27:02,656 --> 00:27:04,558
It was the best meal on this show so far.

620
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:05,959
I agree.

621
00:27:06,026 --> 00:27:07,227
Fabri, great choice.

622
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:09,329
-It's definitely the best.
-Thank you.

623
00:27:09,396 --> 00:27:12,699
Without a doubt,
his love for Korean food is undeniable.

624
00:27:12,766 --> 00:27:14,535
Absolutely.

625
00:27:14,601 --> 00:27:20,007
That's why I moved
all the way to Korea from Italy.

626
00:27:20,073 --> 00:27:22,209
-Right.
-No explanation needed.

627
00:27:22,276 --> 00:27:24,111
When I was in Italy,

628
00:27:24,178 --> 00:27:28,715
I did a lot of research on Korean food.

629
00:27:28,782 --> 00:27:34,521
But I began studying more
after I came here.

630
00:27:34,588 --> 00:27:37,224
-I learned from Monk Jeong Kwan.
-Right.

631
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:41,828
<i>-I studied temple food.</i>
<i>-That's impressive.</i>

632
00:27:42,496 --> 00:27:46,800
CHEF FABRI TAKES THE LEAD
IN GLOBALIZING KOREAN FOOD

633
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:53,073
These days,
all I can think about is Korean food.

634
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,575
That's remarkable.

635
00:27:56,076 --> 00:27:59,713
THE FOODIE BROTHERS ENJOYED KOREAN FOOD
WITH WINE THANKS TO KOTALIAN FABRI

636
00:28:00,314 --> 00:28:06,186
I love this place because they put
so much effort into their food.

637
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:08,889
-I totally agree.
-Also…

638
00:28:09,489 --> 00:28:12,926
And the owners are wonderful people.

639
00:28:12,993 --> 00:28:14,761
They're good-hearted.

640
00:28:14,828 --> 00:28:19,199
They really focus
on the quality of their food.

641
00:28:19,266 --> 00:28:22,369
As a chef, I really respect that.

642
00:28:22,436 --> 00:28:23,704
I love their food.

643
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,005
It's absolutely amazing.

644
00:28:25,072 --> 00:28:26,673
-Oh, yes.
<i>-Salute!</i>

645
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:30,777
