1
00:00:01,945 --> 00:00:03,880
DAECHI-DONG, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL

2
00:00:03,947 --> 00:00:05,415
<i>Where are we today, Taehoon?</i>

3
00:00:05,482 --> 00:00:08,285
<i>-We are at Teheran-ro.</i>
<i>-I see.</i>

4
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:10,987
<i>-There are tons of people.</i>
<i>-I agree.</i>

5
00:00:11,054 --> 00:00:14,024
<i>Today's go-to spot is in this building.</i>

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,859
<i>Wow, it's different today.</i>

7
00:00:15,926 --> 00:00:18,762
<i>We've always visited old-school eateries.</i>
<i>This is too fancy.</i>

8
00:00:20,864 --> 00:00:23,166
TODAY'S FOODIE BROTHERS:
THE THIRD, LIM TAEHOON

9
00:00:25,402 --> 00:00:27,604
THE ELDEST, KIM MINSEONG

10
00:00:29,673 --> 00:00:32,008
THE FOURTH, YOON DUJUN

11
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:36,146
ALL DRESSED UP

12
00:00:36,213 --> 00:00:41,218
We've never dressed in suits
when going to a go-to spot before.

13
00:00:41,585 --> 00:00:42,852
You look uncomfortable.

14
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:44,921
Are you okay? You seem annoyed.

15
00:00:44,988 --> 00:00:46,156
IRRITATED

16
00:00:46,223 --> 00:00:48,692
I was annoyed as soon as
I got the suit call.

17
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:51,661
Why did you tell us to dress up today?

18
00:00:51,728 --> 00:00:55,332
Today's guest is
a very important person to me.

19
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:57,867
He has been a chef for 50 years.

20
00:00:59,035 --> 00:01:02,539
And my relationship with him runs deep.

21
00:01:03,139 --> 00:01:04,307
<i>-Oh, really?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

22
00:01:04,374 --> 00:01:07,510
-Minseong, how long have you been a chef?
-About 30 years.

23
00:01:07,577 --> 00:01:09,713
Wow, the guest has
20 more years of experience.

24
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:13,250
-He's waiting, so let's get moving.
-Of course.

25
00:01:13,316 --> 00:01:15,018
-Let's hurry up.
-Sure.

26
00:01:15,085 --> 00:01:16,586
OFF WE GO TO MEET THE GUEST

27
00:01:18,154 --> 00:01:19,356
It's luxurious.

28
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,192
It's unlike the spots we've been going to.

29
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:23,627
Honestly, I agree.

30
00:01:23,693 --> 00:01:26,429
<i>-Oh, look at the chandelier.</i>
<i>-It has three tiers.</i>

31
00:01:28,198 --> 00:01:30,033
<i>-"Dongboseong."</i>
<i>-"Dongboseong."</i>

32
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,668
<i>That's a classy name.</i>

33
00:01:32,936 --> 00:01:35,639
<i>Look how elegant this place is.</i>

34
00:01:35,705 --> 00:01:37,173
A SPACIOUS DINING AREA

35
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:39,576
<i>-It's extraordinary.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>

36
00:01:40,477 --> 00:01:41,978
<i>Is this our first Chinese spot?</i>

37
00:01:42,045 --> 00:01:44,214
<i>-It is.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

38
00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:45,916
There it is. Wait a second.

39
00:01:45,982 --> 00:01:47,484
-Hold on.
-Look at that.

40
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:49,819
-Let's see.
-Look, "Lim Taehoon."

41
00:01:49,886 --> 00:01:50,987
My name is right there.

42
00:01:51,054 --> 00:01:52,556
It says, "Lim Taehoon."

43
00:01:52,622 --> 00:01:54,190
WELCOMING THE FOODIE BROTHERS

44
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:56,259
Oh, look at this here.

45
00:01:56,326 --> 00:01:58,929
-It's decorated in gold.
-They're gold horses.

46
00:01:58,995 --> 00:02:01,298
<i>-It's a gold carriage.</i>
<i>-There are eight horses.</i>

47
00:02:01,698 --> 00:02:03,233
<i>Wow, it's fancy.</i>

48
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:06,603
Now do you get why we dressed up?

49
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,004
Yes, it's super elegant.

50
00:02:08,672 --> 00:02:10,106
It's a bit overwhelming.

51
00:02:10,173 --> 00:02:11,608
-Where is our room?
-Over here.

52
00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:13,043
-The room at the end?
-Yes.

53
00:02:13,109 --> 00:02:14,244
TO WHERE THE GUEST IS

54
00:02:19,516 --> 00:02:20,517
Good afternoon, sir!

55
00:02:23,386 --> 00:02:25,522
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

56
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:27,257
Hey, Taehoon.

57
00:02:28,124 --> 00:02:29,759
Hello, it's been a while.

58
00:02:30,393 --> 00:02:32,195
-How have you been?
-Great.

59
00:02:32,262 --> 00:02:34,097
-He's my master.
-How's it going?

60
00:02:35,165 --> 00:02:38,101
-Hello, it's a pleasure to meet you.
-Great to meet you.

61
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:39,936
TODAY'S CHEF
YEO KYUNGRAE

62
00:02:41,338 --> 00:02:44,808
HE'S BEEN A CHINESE CUISINE CHEF
FOR 51 YEARS

63
00:02:47,077 --> 00:02:51,681
HIS REPUTATION EXTENDS
BEYOND KOREA TO CHINA AS WELL

64
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:55,952
HE'S A BIG NAME IN CHINESE CUISINE

65
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:58,655
-Pleased to meet you.
-Glad to meet you.

66
00:02:58,722 --> 00:03:01,892
How do you feel, Taehoon?
You're quite different today.

67
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,561
You seem a bit relaxed,
or are you feeling nervous?

68
00:03:04,628 --> 00:03:06,463
I can't help it. My mentor is here.

69
00:03:06,529 --> 00:03:08,531
-You're nervous.
-You shouldn't be.

70
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:11,534
I didn't learn from him directly.

71
00:03:11,601 --> 00:03:16,373
But I learned his recipes from his book,
so he's always been my teacher.

72
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:18,575
-You got lots of help.
-Absolutely.

73
00:03:18,642 --> 00:03:22,646
By the way,
I think this restaurant is unbelievable.

74
00:03:22,712 --> 00:03:26,650
-We checked it out on our way through…
-They gave us a spacious room.

75
00:03:26,716 --> 00:03:30,487
I've heard many important people
come here to dine.

76
00:03:30,554 --> 00:03:32,289
-This restaurant?
-Yes.

77
00:03:32,355 --> 00:03:36,593
This Chinese restaurant is famous
and has been running for a long time.

78
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,397
This place has been called Dongboseong

79
00:03:40,463 --> 00:03:44,401
for about 30 or 40 years.
It used to be in the Namsan Mountain.

80
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:48,004
<i>Overseas Chinese living in Korea</i>
<i>would have weddings in big restaurants.</i>

81
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:50,840
<i>It then moved to Myeongdong</i>
<i>and later to Gangnam.</i>

82
00:03:50,907 --> 00:03:53,510
<i>-We get to come here thanks to you.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>

83
00:03:53,577 --> 00:03:55,111
LONG-STANDING CHINESE RESTAURANT

84
00:03:55,178 --> 00:03:56,379
Check out the menu.

85
00:03:56,446 --> 00:03:58,014
TIME TO LOOK AT THE MENU

86
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:01,651
You'll see that there are
tons of dishes here.

87
00:04:03,753 --> 00:04:05,855
NEVER-ENDING MENU

88
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:11,595
Wow, there are 69 dishes on the menu.

89
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:15,131
There used to be about 100 to 200 dishes.

90
00:04:15,198 --> 00:04:17,534
But it's simplified these days.

91
00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:18,802
This is simplified?

92
00:04:18,868 --> 00:04:21,671
Oh, I want these
braised stuffed sea cucumbers

93
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:23,707
and lobster with chili sauce.

94
00:04:23,773 --> 00:04:26,643
-I'm craving this.
-I also want Mongolian beef.

95
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,212
Wow, shrimp with creamy sauce
sounds amazing.

96
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,482
It looks like you're craving everything,
so I'll tell you how to order.

97
00:04:32,549 --> 00:04:34,084
First, close the menu.

98
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,353
-Hold on…
-He told us to shut it.

99
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:38,188
-Really?
-It's no use looking at this.

100
00:04:38,255 --> 00:04:39,356
Manager.

101
00:04:40,657 --> 00:04:43,960
-Please bring us my favorite dishes.
-Sure.

102
00:04:44,027 --> 00:04:46,663
Since you're a regular here, she knows.

103
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:51,001
There are many dishes here
that you can't eat elsewhere.

104
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:55,338
You will probably see some new dishes
that you've never had.

105
00:04:55,405 --> 00:04:57,307
You will enjoy it.

106
00:04:57,841 --> 00:05:01,344
-I can't wait.
-I'm eager to try his recommendations.

107
00:05:01,411 --> 00:05:02,412
Me too.

108
00:05:02,812 --> 00:05:04,381
-Whoa, it's here.
-I'm excited.

109
00:05:04,447 --> 00:05:05,782
Wow, it looks amazing.

110
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:07,817
<i>It's Chef Yeo Kyungrae's favorites.</i>

111
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:10,520
-What's that?
<i>-Naengchae?</i>

112
00:05:10,587 --> 00:05:13,623
-This is the four-item <i>naengchae.</i>
-They're served separately.

113
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,660
-What is this called?
-Four-item <i>naengchae.</i>

114
00:05:16,726 --> 00:05:18,295
There are four types of <i>naengchae.</i>

115
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:20,030
I've never seen it served this way.

116
00:05:20,096 --> 00:05:23,033
I've seen them all served on one plate,
but never separately.

117
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:25,302
<i>We're familiar with</i>
<i>the cold jellyfish salad.</i>

118
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:28,238
This is century eggs with tofu.

119
00:05:28,305 --> 00:05:31,341
-Soft tofu.
-It's duck eggs with soft tofu.

120
00:05:33,643 --> 00:05:35,445
Here is the seasoned pork liver.

121
00:05:36,179 --> 00:05:38,315
-Is this liver?
-Yes.

122
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:40,250
This is smoked pufferfish.

123
00:05:40,317 --> 00:05:41,985
-Pufferfish?
-Yes.

124
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:49,859
1ST COURSE: FOUR-ITEM <i>NAENGCHAE</i>

125
00:05:51,261 --> 00:05:54,564
-Are these all <i>naengchae?</i>
-Yes.

126
00:05:54,631 --> 00:05:59,236
In Chinese cuisine,
<i>naengchae </i>dishes are appetizers.

127
00:05:59,302 --> 00:06:01,705
These dishes have strong sauces.

128
00:06:01,771 --> 00:06:04,841
After you eat them,
they stimulate your appetite.

129
00:06:04,908 --> 00:06:06,877
<i>They get the stomach moving.</i>

130
00:06:06,943 --> 00:06:08,311
THEY INCREASE YOUR APPETITE

131
00:06:08,378 --> 00:06:10,680
-Let me serve it to you.
-Hello, everyone.

132
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:14,951
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

133
00:06:15,018 --> 00:06:16,286
-Hi.
-Let's see…

134
00:06:16,353 --> 00:06:18,555
-Why don't you come here?
-Shall I go to there?

135
00:06:18,622 --> 00:06:20,257
I have a question for you.

136
00:06:20,323 --> 00:06:22,859
Who is your hairstylist? You look amazing.

137
00:06:22,926 --> 00:06:24,127
STARTS WITH A COMPLIMENT

138
00:06:24,194 --> 00:06:25,595
I want to change my style.

139
00:06:25,662 --> 00:06:27,063
It's definitely possible.

140
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,965
WHO MADE DUJUN SO FLUSTERED?

141
00:06:29,032 --> 00:06:30,200
As soon as he walks in…

142
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:31,301
Nice to meet you.

143
00:06:31,368 --> 00:06:32,369
Hello, Master Yeo.

144
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:35,372
-Hey, there.
-Hiya.

145
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:38,708
DAM SORYONG
HEAD CHEF OF DONGBOSEONG

146
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:43,013
I have worked
with Chef Dam Soryong for a long time,

147
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:44,748
so we're close friends.

148
00:06:44,814 --> 00:06:48,118
At one point,
he was the most famous chef in Korea.

149
00:06:48,184 --> 00:06:51,187
He's bright and cheerful.
You saw him joke around, right?

150
00:06:52,088 --> 00:06:53,089
He's talented.

151
00:06:53,156 --> 00:06:54,991
I also know Chef Dam Soryong…

152
00:06:55,058 --> 00:06:56,760
-Do you know each other?
-Yes.

153
00:06:56,826 --> 00:07:00,997
-He was the head chef of Harimgak.
-The biggest Chinese restaurant in Korea.

154
00:07:01,064 --> 00:07:03,433
-He has 30 years of experience.
-The head chef.

155
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,436
He knows a lot about me.
I thought he forgot.

156
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:08,672
Thank you.

157
00:07:09,205 --> 00:07:11,675
I heard these are all <i>naengchae.</i>

158
00:07:11,741 --> 00:07:16,479
I never knew <i>naengchae </i>were appetizers.

159
00:07:16,546 --> 00:07:20,183
People think that
<i>naengchae </i>are just cold dishes.

160
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,719
But they are also appetizers.

161
00:07:22,786 --> 00:07:26,289
<i>So, they can be hot or cold dishes.</i>
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

162
00:07:26,356 --> 00:07:31,695
I've never seen four-dish <i>naengchae</i>
served on separate dishes.

163
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:33,330
This is the old-fashioned way.

164
00:07:33,396 --> 00:07:37,601
<i>These days, they're served on</i>
<i>a single plate, but this is the old way.</i>

165
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:41,371
<i>They traditionally make it like this</i>
<i>when there's a family event.</i>

166
00:07:42,205 --> 00:07:46,610
If they're served on a single plate,
all the different sauces mix together.

167
00:07:46,676 --> 00:07:49,980
So, they're served separately
to maintain their distinct flavors.

168
00:07:50,647 --> 00:07:53,316
-Then shall we try them?
-Yes.

169
00:07:53,383 --> 00:07:55,285
Please enjoy. I'll come back later.

170
00:07:55,352 --> 00:07:56,353
Thanks for the food.

171
00:07:57,854 --> 00:08:01,892
STARTING WITH THE COLD JELLYFISH SALAD

172
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:03,526
Thank you.

173
00:08:06,463 --> 00:08:10,033
TAKING A HEARTY BITE

174
00:08:12,135 --> 00:08:13,937
YUM

175
00:08:17,173 --> 00:08:21,177
TAEHOON CAREFULLY SAVORS THE FOOD

176
00:08:21,811 --> 00:08:22,812
NODS

177
00:08:24,714 --> 00:08:26,650
How is the cold jellyfish salad?

178
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:27,851
I'm loving it.

179
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:29,019
It's not overly sour.

180
00:08:29,085 --> 00:08:32,188
Usually, it has a ton of mustard,
which hits the nose.

181
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,491
I think it's slightly bland.

182
00:08:34,558 --> 00:08:37,627
In Chinese cuisine,
mustard isn't added to this.

183
00:08:37,694 --> 00:08:38,728
Is that so?

184
00:08:38,795 --> 00:08:42,098
<i>They mix it in garlic sauce,</i>
<i>so it's tangy and sweet.</i>

185
00:08:42,165 --> 00:08:46,136
Usually, there are cucumbers
in cold jellyfish salad.

186
00:08:46,202 --> 00:08:47,871
But there's napa cabbage instead.

187
00:08:47,938 --> 00:08:52,275
<i>It tastes more refreshing</i>
<i>with the napa cabbage.</i>

188
00:08:52,342 --> 00:08:53,476
<i>I see.</i>

189
00:08:53,543 --> 00:08:56,613
Usually, there are cucumbers in this dish.

190
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,982
-That's the classic way.
-Exactly.

191
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:03,954
Just note that if you see napa cabbage,
it means they're sticking to tradition.

192
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,958
Keep in mind that these chefs
have many years of experience.

193
00:09:08,024 --> 00:09:09,559
-Good to know.
-Definitely.

194
00:09:09,626 --> 00:09:12,929
-I'll show off my new knowledge.
-You should also add this instead.

195
00:09:12,996 --> 00:09:15,565
-Yes, I learned something today.
-For the tradition.

196
00:09:15,632 --> 00:09:18,268
TAEHOON GAINED A LOT OF INSIGHT TODAY

197
00:09:20,237 --> 00:09:21,638
I'm really craving this.

198
00:09:22,072 --> 00:09:23,807
-The century egg…
-Shall we try?

199
00:09:23,873 --> 00:09:27,077
THE NEXT DISH IS
CENTURY EGG WITH SOFT TOFU

200
00:09:27,143 --> 00:09:29,379
-Is the black stuff duck eggs?
-Yes.

201
00:09:29,446 --> 00:09:31,147
<i>The century eggs are good.</i>

202
00:09:31,214 --> 00:09:32,549
<i>They have a nutty flavor.</i>

203
00:09:32,616 --> 00:09:34,651
I'd like to know why they're black.

204
00:09:34,718 --> 00:09:36,953
-They're fermented duck eggs.
-That's right.

205
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,256
<i>In China, they ferment</i>
<i>in earthenware jars.</i>

206
00:09:39,322 --> 00:09:42,993
<i>They add rice straw and bran</i>
<i>while fermenting them.</i>

207
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:44,794
<i>That's how they make century eggs.</i>

208
00:09:44,861 --> 00:09:46,096
CENTURY EGG

209
00:09:46,162 --> 00:09:48,732
A CLEAR PATTERN OF PINE FLOWERS

210
00:09:51,134 --> 00:09:54,471
WHAT WILL IT TASTE LIKE?

211
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,641
It's nutty.

212
00:10:01,444 --> 00:10:02,445
YUM

213
00:10:02,979 --> 00:10:04,681
The soft tofu is so light.

214
00:10:05,382 --> 00:10:07,884
-But the century egg is milder.
-Yes.

215
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:11,021
It has a rich flavor,
and the yolk is savory.

216
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:12,088
<i>Right.</i>

217
00:10:12,522 --> 00:10:16,159
-Wow, the sauce is super strong.
-I agree.

218
00:10:16,226 --> 00:10:19,229
It has a tangy, sweet, and strong flavor,

219
00:10:19,296 --> 00:10:21,865
<i>so you can say that</i>
<i>these Chinese appetizers</i>

220
00:10:21,932 --> 00:10:24,434
<i>stimulate your appetite once you taste it.</i>

221
00:10:25,035 --> 00:10:27,504
And if you like cilantro, add some in.

222
00:10:27,571 --> 00:10:29,673
-Of course.
-I'll add some.

223
00:10:29,739 --> 00:10:32,175
-I love cilantro.
-Can I have some?

224
00:10:32,242 --> 00:10:33,243
Oh, thank you.

225
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,878
THE CILANTRO-LOVER TAKES A HEAP

226
00:10:36,146 --> 00:10:41,051
In China, they ferment them
in earthenware jars.

227
00:10:42,752 --> 00:10:44,421
CHEF KYUNGRAE ADDS CILANTRO

228
00:10:44,487 --> 00:10:46,623
The yolk is very rich.

229
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:51,027
I feel like I'm eating real Chinese food
after adding the cilantro.

230
00:10:51,728 --> 00:10:54,731
Why is this glass here?

231
00:10:54,798 --> 00:10:58,435
Since I invited Master Yeo today,

232
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:00,971
I brought a meaningful bottle of alcohol.

233
00:11:01,037 --> 00:11:02,739
-Oh, you brought alcohol?
-Yes.

234
00:11:02,806 --> 00:11:03,907
How is it meaningful?

235
00:11:04,407 --> 00:11:05,408
Here it is.

236
00:11:07,377 --> 00:11:09,045
-It's an M6.
-It looks like a trophy.

237
00:11:09,112 --> 00:11:12,716
I'll tell you why it's significant.
This is called M*ngzhilan.

238
00:11:12,782 --> 00:11:16,519
It means "a boundless dream."

239
00:11:16,586 --> 00:11:18,989
And it reminds me
of my dream master, Chef Yeo.

240
00:11:21,124 --> 00:11:22,959
I brought this because I met him.

241
00:11:23,026 --> 00:11:24,160
He's great at this.

242
00:11:26,363 --> 00:11:27,364
Here we go.

243
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,736
-It's renowned as a top-quality liquor.
-Really?

244
00:11:34,938 --> 00:11:36,373
Oh, you pour it in here.

245
00:11:36,439 --> 00:11:37,440
INTO A DECANTER

246
00:11:37,507 --> 00:11:39,709
-Let me serve Master Yeo first.
-All right.

247
00:11:40,677 --> 00:11:42,312
I'll have half a glass, please.

248
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,282
You like having a sip of it.

249
00:11:45,348 --> 00:11:47,584
Yes, that tastes the best.

250
00:11:48,018 --> 00:11:49,019
Thank you.

251
00:11:53,623 --> 00:11:54,991
Let's be careful not to spill.

252
00:11:55,058 --> 00:11:57,394
MASTER YEO POURS A GLASS FOR TAEHOON

253
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,096
-It smells very sweet.
-The <i>naengchae…</i>

254
00:12:00,163 --> 00:12:01,965
Cheers, everyone.

255
00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:04,234
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

256
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:05,902
-It's an honor.
-Cheers.

257
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:15,545
EVERYONE IS RELISHING THE FLAVOR

258
00:12:17,514 --> 00:12:18,748
Dang, this is insane.

259
00:12:19,883 --> 00:12:21,484
-Isn't the aroma nice?
-Yes.

260
00:12:22,219 --> 00:12:23,620
It has a fruity scent.

261
00:12:23,687 --> 00:12:24,721
Wow, it's fantastic.

262
00:12:24,788 --> 00:12:28,458
-It pairs well with the <i>naengchae.</i>
-It sure does.

263
00:12:28,525 --> 00:12:30,727
<i>It goes well</i>
<i>with this tangy and sweet dish.</i>

264
00:12:30,794 --> 00:12:33,863
THE SWEET FLAVOR IS PERFECT
WITH THE SWEET AND SOUR <i>NAENGCHAE</i>

265
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,265
<i>What shall we try next?</i>

266
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:38,668
-I want to try this.
-The liver?

267
00:12:38,735 --> 00:12:40,637
-What's in this?
-Liver and green onions.

268
00:12:40,704 --> 00:12:42,272
<i>-Is it pork liver?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

269
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:44,241
<i>It goes well with the green onions.</i>

270
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:49,512
Let me do it.

271
00:12:50,046 --> 00:12:54,017
It's totally different from the liver
that comes with <i>sundae.</i>

272
00:12:54,084 --> 00:12:55,852
-It looks similar.
-It's the texture.

273
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,454
It's got a different bite to it.

274
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,989
<i>This is more chewy.</i>

275
00:12:59,055 --> 00:13:00,423
IT HAS A NICE, CHEWY TEXTURE

276
00:13:01,558 --> 00:13:04,694
TAEHOON HAS IT WITH CILANTRO

277
00:13:05,228 --> 00:13:07,530
I think I had this in China before.

278
00:13:07,597 --> 00:13:09,466
This is made the old-fashioned way,

279
00:13:09,532 --> 00:13:11,635
so there aren't
many places that make this.

280
00:13:13,703 --> 00:13:15,906
DUJUN TAKES A BIG BITE

281
00:13:15,972 --> 00:13:17,407
It's completely different.

282
00:13:17,474 --> 00:13:18,642
CAN'T HELP BUT EXCLAIM

283
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,210
-I'll try this, too.
-Sure.

284
00:13:20,277 --> 00:13:23,179
-Is this pufferfish?
-Yes.

285
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,515
It's not salty at all.

286
00:13:25,582 --> 00:13:27,050
You're right.

287
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,123
YUM

288
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:36,726
At first, I thought it was a bit dry.

289
00:13:36,793 --> 00:13:39,429
But the more I chew it…
It's extremely moist.

290
00:13:39,496 --> 00:13:41,598
THE MORE YOU CHEW IT,
THE MORE MOIST IT GETS

291
00:13:41,665 --> 00:13:45,669
Master, this tastes
like the pork jerky in China.

292
00:13:45,735 --> 00:13:48,405
That's because it's made in a similar way.

293
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:52,709
<i>It's sweet and salty like jerky.</i>

294
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,346
I've never seen pufferfish jerky
in a Chinese restaurant.

295
00:13:56,413 --> 00:13:57,948
I didn't even know it existed.

296
00:13:58,014 --> 00:14:02,285
It's because ordinary restaurants
don't usually make this.

297
00:14:03,353 --> 00:14:05,422
I really want to learn how to make this.

298
00:14:05,488 --> 00:14:07,057
I should work here for a while.

299
00:14:07,557 --> 00:14:09,826
It's a whole new world of <i>naengchae.</i>

300
00:14:09,893 --> 00:14:12,229
I didn't know these were
all called <i>naengchae.</i>

301
00:14:12,295 --> 00:14:14,264
There are a hundred kinds of <i>naengchae.</i>

302
00:14:14,331 --> 00:14:17,067
Only the popular <i>naengchae </i>dishes are

303
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:20,370
on the menu
in Chinese restaurants in Korea.

304
00:14:20,437 --> 00:14:22,806
<i>There are more dishes out there.</i>

305
00:14:22,872 --> 00:14:24,374
<i>I'm already full from these.</i>

306
00:14:24,441 --> 00:14:26,443
A NEW WORLD OF CHINESE
<i>NAENGCHAE </i>IS HERE

307
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,812
SURPRISED

308
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,915
Wow, there are so many dishes.

309
00:14:31,982 --> 00:14:33,149
THE MAIN DISHES ARE HERE

310
00:14:33,216 --> 00:14:36,353
-This is <i>sajadu.</i>
-<i>Sajadu?</i>

311
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:38,488
<i>SAJADU</i>

312
00:14:38,555 --> 00:14:41,691
-This is Sichuan-style braised chicken.
-Thank you.

313
00:14:41,758 --> 00:14:42,993
<i>Wow, this is insane.</i>

314
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:44,527
SICHUAN-STYLE BRAISED CHICKEN

315
00:14:44,594 --> 00:14:47,230
Here are the deep-fried beef ribs.

316
00:14:47,297 --> 00:14:49,299
-Whoa, beef ribs?
-Wow, what's this?

317
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:51,968
-Where else would you get to eat this?
-Exactly.

318
00:14:52,035 --> 00:14:54,437
<i>-These are seerfish dumplings.</i>
<i>-Really?</i>

319
00:14:54,504 --> 00:14:55,505
SEERFISH DUMPLINGS

320
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:02,012
2ND COURSE: SIGNATURE DISHES

321
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:03,346
AND A SECRET DISH

322
00:15:03,413 --> 00:15:04,648
<i>-Let's try them.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

323
00:15:04,714 --> 00:15:09,252
Let's try the ribs first
since they get tough when they get cold.

324
00:15:09,319 --> 00:15:11,922
-It looks unbelievable.
-Definitely.

325
00:15:11,988 --> 00:15:13,223
Let's eat with our hands.

326
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,724
How many pieces are there?

327
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,761
Wow, I'll also take a piece.

328
00:15:17,827 --> 00:15:18,995
STRAIGHT OUT OF A COMIC

329
00:15:19,062 --> 00:15:20,697
I've only seen this in comic.

330
00:15:21,364 --> 00:15:22,499
Wait, this is…

331
00:15:25,302 --> 00:15:29,039
RIBS ARE BEST EATEN BY HAND

332
00:15:31,007 --> 00:15:32,108
This is huge.

333
00:15:33,243 --> 00:15:35,378
-It's super tender.
-I absolutely agree.

334
00:15:36,146 --> 00:15:39,282
-The meat just comes off the bone.
-It sure does.

335
00:15:39,983 --> 00:15:44,120
It's slightly crispy outside
and super juicy inside.

336
00:15:44,454 --> 00:15:46,456
The inside is like braised short ribs.

337
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:50,160
STEAMS BEEF RIBS FOR 2 HOURS

338
00:15:51,161 --> 00:15:53,797
COATS THEM IN FRYING BATTER MIX

339
00:15:54,965 --> 00:15:57,701
DUNKS THEM IN HOT OIL

340
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:04,274
CRISPY OUTSIDE AND JUICY INSIDE,
DEEP-FRIED BEEF RIBS

341
00:16:04,641 --> 00:16:05,642
This is delicious.

342
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:09,646
TAKES ONE MORE BITE

343
00:16:09,713 --> 00:16:12,115
What is this crispy stuff on the outside?

344
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,851
IT'S COVERED IN CRISPY FLAKES

345
00:16:14,918 --> 00:16:16,453
<i>I love the aroma.</i>

346
00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:21,358
TAEHOON AND MINSEONG ALSO TAKE A BITE

347
00:16:21,424 --> 00:16:24,427
-These are some kind of flakes…
-Isn't it scrumptious?

348
00:16:24,494 --> 00:16:27,230
When chefs master the basics,

349
00:16:27,297 --> 00:16:31,368
they add their own special twist on them.

350
00:16:31,434 --> 00:16:34,738
I heard these were originally
Hong Kong-style deep-fried beef ribs.

351
00:16:35,372 --> 00:16:36,406
BIPUNGDANG

352
00:16:36,473 --> 00:16:38,808
RECIPE ORIGINATING FROM
THE BIPUNGDANG AREA

353
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,011
STIR-FRIES SEAFOOD
WITH BREADCRUMBS, GARLIC…

354
00:16:41,645 --> 00:16:46,216
ADAPTED THE BIPUNGDANG RECIPE
TO MAKE CHINESE DEEP-FRIED BEEF RIBS

355
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,986
STIR-FRIES IT WITH
DEEP-FRIED GARLIC AND SHALLOTS

356
00:16:53,523 --> 00:16:58,028
THE CRISPINESS AND RICH FLAVOR
FILL YOUR MOUTH

357
00:17:01,831 --> 00:17:02,966
You ate it all.

358
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:04,568
It's incredible.

359
00:17:04,935 --> 00:17:07,137
-I can smell the meaty aroma.
-Right.

360
00:17:08,004 --> 00:17:09,272
Let's try the next dish.

361
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:11,975
-These are meatballs.
-Is this <i>sajadu?</i>

362
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:13,543
-Yes.
-What does that mean?

363
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,512
-It means "lion head."
-Exactly.

364
00:17:16,046 --> 00:17:18,248
<i>Oh, now I get it.</i>

365
00:17:18,315 --> 00:17:21,651
THE NAME COMES FROM ITS BUMPY SURFACE,
WHICH RESEMBLES A LION'S HEAD

366
00:17:22,252 --> 00:17:25,222
The chefs who can make it super tender
are true experts.

367
00:17:25,288 --> 00:17:27,857
-Thank you.
-Skillful chefs make it tender.

368
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,994
The more tender it is,
the more skilled the chef.

369
00:17:31,595 --> 00:17:33,964
Wow, I stuck my chopsticks in,
and it's so soft.

370
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:38,101
Dang, it splits open
the moment I touch it with my chopsticks.

371
00:17:39,035 --> 00:17:40,136
<i>I can't believe this.</i>

372
00:17:40,237 --> 00:17:43,106
IT JUST FALLS APART WITH CHOPSTICKS

373
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:50,647
TAKES A BITE

374
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,051
Dujun will be taken aback.

375
00:17:56,286 --> 00:17:58,788
TAKES A BITE

376
00:18:01,691 --> 00:18:03,460
It's like tofu on the inside.

377
00:18:04,027 --> 00:18:06,663
<i>-It's not like meat.</i>
<i>-It's super soft.</i>

378
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,098
<i>It's extremely tender.</i>

379
00:18:08,164 --> 00:18:09,633
MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH LIKE TOFU

380
00:18:09,699 --> 00:18:11,601
-Is there water chestnut in here?
-Yes.

381
00:18:11,668 --> 00:18:14,037
-What's inside?
-Water chestnut.

382
00:18:14,104 --> 00:18:15,472
It's called water chestnut.

383
00:18:15,906 --> 00:18:17,607
THE FRUIT OF THE AQUATIC PLANT <i>MAREUM</i>

384
00:18:17,674 --> 00:18:19,876
CALLED WATER CHESTNUT
FOR ITS CHESTNUT-LIKE TASTE

385
00:18:20,744 --> 00:18:25,782
CRUNCHY WATER CHESTNUTS
COMPLEMENT THE TENDER PORK

386
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:31,488
I heard that <i>sajadu </i>has long been
a signature dish of this restaurant.

387
00:18:31,555 --> 00:18:32,589
I see.

388
00:18:32,656 --> 00:18:35,859
Actually, I'm working on this dish
as a new menu item at my restaurant.

389
00:18:35,926 --> 00:18:38,194
-Oh, really?
-It's super tender.

390
00:18:38,261 --> 00:18:39,429
More than mine.

391
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:44,534
CAN'T HELP BUT ACKNOWLEDGE
ITS EXTREME TENDERNESS

392
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:46,836
Shall we change plates?

393
00:18:46,903 --> 00:18:48,505
-I'll move it to the side.
-Okay.

394
00:18:49,239 --> 00:18:51,942
-Help yourselves to a knife.
-Sure.

395
00:18:52,008 --> 00:18:54,010
It's packed with green onions.

396
00:18:54,077 --> 00:18:56,680
-I guess they add it for the aroma.
-Oh, thank you.

397
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,316
AROMATIC

398
00:18:59,382 --> 00:19:00,884
<i>Sichuan-style braised chicken.</i>

399
00:19:00,951 --> 00:19:04,521
SICHUAN-STYLE BRAISED CHICKEN

400
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,959
WHAT DOES IT TASTE LIKE?

401
00:19:17,634 --> 00:19:19,202
It's super light.

402
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:21,338
It doesn't taste like it smells.

403
00:19:21,404 --> 00:19:25,375
<i>The sauce looks very spicy and strong,</i>
<i>but it's not.</i>

404
00:19:25,442 --> 00:19:27,811
<i>It's just lightly seasoned.</i>

405
00:19:27,878 --> 00:19:31,047
It's not spicy.
It's just smooth and easy to eat.

406
00:19:31,114 --> 00:19:35,986
Master, Sichuan food
is usually a bit spicy.

407
00:19:36,052 --> 00:19:39,522
There's a lot of <i>mala,</i>
and it's strong and salty.

408
00:19:39,589 --> 00:19:42,893
As I said before,
when chefs master the basics,

409
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:46,963
they change the recipes
in their own special style.

410
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:50,033
Chef Dam Soryong put his own spin on it.

411
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,702
<i>There's a sauce called black bean sauce.</i>

412
00:19:54,938 --> 00:19:58,174
MADE FROM FERMENTING BLACK BEANS

413
00:19:58,975 --> 00:20:02,412
KNOWN FOR ITS ACIDITY AND CHEWINESS

414
00:20:04,881 --> 00:20:08,585
THIS SICHUAN-STYLE BRAISED CHICKEN
IS MADE WITH BLACK BEAN SAUCE

415
00:20:11,021 --> 00:20:14,524
<i>At first sight,</i>
<i>the sauce seems super strong,</i>

416
00:20:14,591 --> 00:20:16,593
<i>but it's toned down to a mild flavor.</i>

417
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,661
<i>I see.</i>

418
00:20:18,828 --> 00:20:21,598
-It looks salty.
-But it's actually not.

419
00:20:21,665 --> 00:20:25,302
The sauce has a spicy kick at the end.

420
00:20:25,368 --> 00:20:26,603
<i>It's certainly there.</i>

421
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,872
<i>-It's spicy.</i>
<i>-It sure is.</i>

422
00:20:28,939 --> 00:20:30,941
<i>There's a hint of spice.</i>

423
00:20:31,007 --> 00:20:32,943
A TOUCH OF SPICE HIDDEN INSIDE

424
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:35,712
-Let's try the fish dumplings.
-Sure.

425
00:20:36,446 --> 00:20:40,016
<i>They usually use seerfish</i>
<i>for the stuffing.</i>

426
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,451
<i>They're filled with it.</i>

427
00:20:41,985 --> 00:20:43,620
-Fish dumplings?
-Yes.

428
00:20:43,687 --> 00:20:46,189
-I don't think I've ever had one.
-What do we dip it in?

429
00:20:46,256 --> 00:20:48,258
-The mustard sauce.
-Okay.

430
00:20:48,325 --> 00:20:51,061
-You can also eat it as is.
-I'll try it without sauce.

431
00:20:51,127 --> 00:20:52,896
It's great without any sauce.

432
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,467
The dumplings have plenty of fish juice
in them, so people love them.

433
00:20:57,534 --> 00:20:59,369
Wow, this is interesting.

434
00:21:01,605 --> 00:21:06,643
TRYING IT WITH MUSTARD SAUCE THIS TIME

435
00:21:09,446 --> 00:21:12,115
SATISFIED

436
00:21:12,182 --> 00:21:16,052
-It's not fishy at all.
-I totally agree.

437
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:19,122
Man, it's like eating
scrumptious fishcakes.

438
00:21:19,189 --> 00:21:22,893
It's like fishcakes
made entirely from seerfish.

439
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:24,628
<i>Yes, I'm loving this.</i>

440
00:21:24,694 --> 00:21:26,529
RICH AND FLAVORFUL, LIKE FISHCAKE

441
00:21:26,596 --> 00:21:29,132
-Help yourself.
-I'll have one more.

442
00:21:29,199 --> 00:21:31,268
They're extremely juicy.

443
00:21:31,334 --> 00:21:35,338
They would've been so good
if we had eaten them warm.

444
00:21:36,606 --> 00:21:37,841
It's time for a drink.

445
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:39,709
Of course.

446
00:21:40,677 --> 00:21:43,880
The juiciness calls for a drink.

447
00:21:44,481 --> 00:21:46,283
<i>"The juiciness calls for a drink."</i>

448
00:21:46,349 --> 00:21:47,417
<i>Dang, this is good.</i>

449
00:21:53,857 --> 00:21:56,459
We're having a real treat
thanks to Master Yeo.

450
00:21:58,828 --> 00:22:01,765
Wow, here comes another masterpiece.

451
00:22:03,099 --> 00:22:05,702
-Chef, the food is amazing.
-Hi, it's me again.

452
00:22:05,769 --> 00:22:07,037
THE CHEF HAS A SECRET DISH

453
00:22:07,103 --> 00:22:08,104
The last dish is here.

454
00:22:09,806 --> 00:22:12,409
-What is this?
-It's sea bream.

455
00:22:12,475 --> 00:22:15,345
<i>-Is it sweet and sour sea bream?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

456
00:22:15,412 --> 00:22:16,680
<i>It's humongous.</i>

457
00:22:19,082 --> 00:22:22,285
THOROUGHLY COATS
THE LARGE SEA BREAM IN BATTER MIX

458
00:22:24,221 --> 00:22:27,390
GENTLY PUTS IT INTO BOILING OIL,
STARTING WITH THE HEAD

459
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:31,061
IT'S BEAUTIFULLY DEEP-FRIED

460
00:22:32,662 --> 00:22:37,400
ADDS VARIOUS VEGETABLES AND CONDIMENTS
TO MAKE SAUCE WITH THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY

461
00:22:38,201 --> 00:22:41,504
CAREFULLY POURS IT
ONTO THE DEEP-FRIED SEA BREAM

462
00:22:42,105 --> 00:22:45,008
DELICIOUS SWEET AND SOUR
SEA BREAM IS READY

463
00:22:45,075 --> 00:22:48,345
From the beginning
of the full course meal,

464
00:22:48,411 --> 00:22:50,413
<i>there were appetizers</i>

465
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,481
"FROM THE APPETIZERS"

466
00:22:51,548 --> 00:22:54,384
<i>and there were dishes</i>
<i>with beef and chicken.</i>

467
00:22:54,451 --> 00:22:55,552
BRAISED CHICKEN

468
00:22:55,619 --> 00:22:57,787
<i>I prepared a diverse selection of dishes.</i>

469
00:22:57,854 --> 00:22:59,856
<i>There are all types of protein here.</i>

470
00:22:59,923 --> 00:23:02,959
<i>"Eo" </i>is the Chinese word for fish.

471
00:23:03,026 --> 00:23:06,863
It's pronounced the same as the word
for "relaxed" in Chinese.

472
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:09,499
<i>That's why fish dishes</i>
<i>are served at the end.</i>

473
00:23:09,566 --> 00:23:12,736
<i>There's a special meaning to it,</i>
<i>so you have to try it.</i>

474
00:23:12,802 --> 00:23:13,803
<i>Got it.</i>

475
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:16,539
We also think of fish as a boat.

476
00:23:16,606 --> 00:23:18,708
We can't turn it over.

477
00:23:18,775 --> 00:23:21,111
-Because boats shouldn't capsize.
-Exactly.

478
00:23:21,177 --> 00:23:26,149
So we have to carefully debone it
with all our hearts.

479
00:23:26,716 --> 00:23:28,418
There's a story behind the fish.

480
00:23:30,153 --> 00:23:31,421
Let me serve it.

481
00:23:31,488 --> 00:23:32,756
CHEF DAM DEBONES IT HIMSELF

482
00:23:32,822 --> 00:23:35,158
I'll serve the best part to Master Yeo.

483
00:23:38,061 --> 00:23:39,763
It's packed with love.

484
00:23:42,432 --> 00:23:44,000
It's full of love.

485
00:23:44,067 --> 00:23:45,835
David would've loved this.

486
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:47,871
Chef, you're an expert at this.

487
00:23:47,938 --> 00:23:50,240
I'm great at deboning.

488
00:23:51,408 --> 00:23:54,311
That's why I like to say,
"From bone to bon appétit."

489
00:23:55,011 --> 00:23:56,012
Oh, no.

490
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:57,080
DIZZY FROM THE JOKE

491
00:23:57,147 --> 00:23:59,983
We also need to order other dishes.

492
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,885
Let's try the beef brisket <i>jjamppong.</i>

493
00:24:01,952 --> 00:24:04,020
-Why don't we also try the <i>jjajangmyeon?</i>
-Yes.

494
00:24:04,087 --> 00:24:05,622
Would you like two of each?

495
00:24:05,689 --> 00:24:07,557
-Sure.
-Got it.

496
00:24:07,624 --> 00:24:09,626
-Have a good time.
-Thank you.

497
00:24:10,827 --> 00:24:13,530
WHAT DOES THE LAST DISH
OF THE FULL COURSE MEAL TASTE LIKE?

498
00:24:14,197 --> 00:24:15,365
YUM

499
00:24:17,801 --> 00:24:20,971
AS THE DRAGON KING OF YEOUIDO,
HE TRIES IT AFTER OBSERVING CAREFULLY

500
00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:24,674
-Minseong, is this red sea bream?
-Yes, it is.

501
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:27,177
-It's a wild-caught sea bream.
-I see.

502
00:24:27,244 --> 00:24:30,580
It's delicious
because it's nicely deep-fried.

503
00:24:30,647 --> 00:24:32,349
<i>If it's this big,</i>

504
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,517
<i>it's hard to deep-fry it.</i>

505
00:24:36,486 --> 00:24:38,688
-I'm loving this.
-Wow, it's awesome.

506
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,591
-It's not fishy.
-Not at all.

507
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:45,195
The sauce is sweet, salty, and sour.

508
00:24:45,262 --> 00:24:46,963
<i>-It's perfect.</i>
<i>-It's scrumptious.</i>

509
00:24:47,664 --> 00:24:52,135
<i>Tangsuyuk </i>is made with various ingredients
such as pork, chicken, or fish.

510
00:24:53,003 --> 00:24:54,704
This is perfectly seasoned.

511
00:24:55,305 --> 00:24:57,807
<i>The sauce pairs well with the sea bream.</i>

512
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:01,077
<i>It's perfectly balanced.</i>

513
00:25:01,144 --> 00:25:04,848
The fish is naturally seasoned as well.

514
00:25:04,915 --> 00:25:07,551
I have a question about the sauce
for this fish dish.

515
00:25:07,617 --> 00:25:09,085
Is the sauce always on top?

516
00:25:09,152 --> 00:25:10,687
Is it never on the side?

517
00:25:10,754 --> 00:25:16,226
Pouring the sauce over it
is the classic way.

518
00:25:16,293 --> 00:25:19,162
-Sauce on the side is a Korean thing.
-Oh, really?

519
00:25:19,229 --> 00:25:22,165
When the food is delivered,
the portion shrinks with the sauce.

520
00:25:22,232 --> 00:25:23,233
And it gets soggy.

521
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,569
Taehoon and I both delivered food,
so we know.

522
00:25:26,102 --> 00:25:27,837
<i>That's why that option exists.</i>

523
00:25:27,904 --> 00:25:30,040
THE CRISPY EXTERIOR SOAKS UP THE SAUCE

524
00:25:31,241 --> 00:25:35,545
It's my first time trying all of these,
except the cold jellyfish salad.

525
00:25:35,612 --> 00:25:37,113
<i>-Really?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

526
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,684
I think you enjoyed the food overall.

527
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:44,321
Absolutely, there weren't any dishes
that were difficult to eat.

528
00:25:44,387 --> 00:25:48,225
I could taste the natural flavors
of the ingredients.

529
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:51,428
When I visited the Shandong area,

530
00:25:51,494 --> 00:25:53,496
they didn't use many spices.

531
00:25:53,563 --> 00:25:54,764
-Really?
-No, they don't.

532
00:25:54,831 --> 00:25:56,399
It's more commonly used inland.

533
00:25:56,466 --> 00:26:00,570
The food is milder,
so the natural flavors come through more.

534
00:26:00,637 --> 00:26:04,341
Even the umami comes
from the ingredients' natural flavors.

535
00:26:04,407 --> 00:26:06,977
<i>It puts more emphasis on that.</i>

536
00:26:08,111 --> 00:26:10,680
Chef, you have 50 years of experience…

537
00:26:10,747 --> 00:26:13,149
-It will soon be 51 years.
-That's amazing.

538
00:26:13,216 --> 00:26:14,985
He celebrated his 50th anniversary.

539
00:26:15,051 --> 00:26:17,787
Fifty years have flown by
in the blink of an eye.

540
00:26:17,854 --> 00:26:20,056
How did you start making Chinese food?

541
00:26:20,857 --> 00:26:26,129
At that time,
I personally wanted to study more.

542
00:26:26,196 --> 00:26:28,398
But my family was poor.
My father wasn't around.

543
00:26:28,465 --> 00:26:31,134
So, I had to make money and learn a skill.

544
00:26:31,201 --> 00:26:33,136
I remember crying for a whole week.

545
00:26:34,104 --> 00:26:35,672
I really wanted to study.

546
00:26:35,739 --> 00:26:39,142
You started delivering food
when you were 15 years old, right?

547
00:26:39,209 --> 00:26:42,546
Right, that happened unintentionally.

548
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,282
I saw Chinese restaurants as depressing.

549
00:26:45,348 --> 00:26:47,517
You can easily fall into crime doing that.

550
00:26:47,584 --> 00:26:48,585
That's right.

551
00:26:48,652 --> 00:26:54,391
One day, I realized that
if no one was going to save me,

552
00:26:54,457 --> 00:26:55,825
I had to save myself.

553
00:26:55,892 --> 00:26:57,427
That's why I started cooking.

554
00:26:57,494 --> 00:27:00,764
And then I went to a huge restaurant.

555
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:05,602
I saw a few chefs who made food
as if it were a work of art.

556
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:07,470
My eyes popped open.

557
00:27:07,537 --> 00:27:10,140
It lowered my chances
of becoming a troubled teen

558
00:27:10,206 --> 00:27:12,342
because I met good mentors and seniors.

559
00:27:12,409 --> 00:27:15,412
That experience made me who I am today.

560
00:27:15,478 --> 00:27:16,780
That's right.

561
00:27:16,846 --> 00:27:18,615
HE HAS BECOME THE CHEF HE IS TODAY

562
00:27:22,185 --> 00:27:23,753
What would you like?

563
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,556
-I'll have the <i>jjamppong.</i>
-Sure, it's beef brisket <i>jjamppong.</i>

564
00:27:26,623 --> 00:27:28,959
-That's a huge portion.
-It's a lot…

565
00:27:29,025 --> 00:27:31,294
-I'll have <i>jjajangmyeon.</i>
-That's a lot.

566
00:27:32,596 --> 00:27:35,198
<i>JJAJANGMYEON </i>WITH SEAFOOD

567
00:27:35,632 --> 00:27:40,704
3RD COURSE: NOODLES

568
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:44,674
Wow, I love that we're having
a full course of Chinese food.

569
00:27:44,741 --> 00:27:48,078
There shouldn't be an aftertaste
after eating lots of Chinese food.

570
00:27:48,144 --> 00:27:51,748
I don't think there's much of that today.

571
00:27:51,815 --> 00:27:54,217
I feel like Chinese food
is usually greasy,

572
00:27:54,284 --> 00:27:55,819
but it was very light today.

573
00:27:55,886 --> 00:27:58,788
There's a reason I ordered noodles.

574
00:27:58,855 --> 00:28:02,259
There are hundreds of strands of noodles.

575
00:28:02,325 --> 00:28:07,297
<i>I hope our friendship remains unbroken</i>
<i>like these noodles.</i>

576
00:28:07,364 --> 00:28:08,632
<i>Thank you for the food.</i>

577
00:28:09,366 --> 00:28:11,635
-Thank you.
-Look at this.

578
00:28:12,469 --> 00:28:14,437
The noodles are long.

579
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:16,940
-They signify "live a long life."
-Yes.

580
00:28:17,007 --> 00:28:18,308
It carries a good meaning.

581
00:28:19,709 --> 00:28:23,313
There's something called "long noodles."

582
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:27,284
It's usually used for important birthdays
like someone's 70th or 80th birthday.

583
00:28:31,121 --> 00:28:32,122
Hold on.

584
00:28:33,323 --> 00:28:34,324
What's this?

585
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:40,463
-It's a shiitake mushroom.
-Yes, they use that instead of meat.

586
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:45,569
It's like I'm chewing meat,
but it's a shiitake mushroom.

587
00:28:47,203 --> 00:28:49,139
WHAT DOES THE BEEF BRISKET TASTE LIKE?

588
00:28:49,205 --> 00:28:50,874
This is beef brisket <i>jjamppong…</i>

589
00:28:52,642 --> 00:28:55,445
SLURPS

590
00:28:56,146 --> 00:28:58,949
SLURPS AGAIN

591
00:28:59,749 --> 00:29:02,619
SLURPS AGAIN

592
00:29:02,686 --> 00:29:04,287
MINSEONG IS OBSESSED WITH IT

593
00:29:04,354 --> 00:29:05,488
I'm loving this.

594
00:29:05,555 --> 00:29:06,690
Minseong, how is it?

595
00:29:06,756 --> 00:29:10,293
The <i>jjamppong </i>has a spicy kick to it.

596
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:15,532
<i>The fat from the beef brisket melted</i>
<i>into the broth, and is delicious.</i>

597
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:17,467
<i>-I see.</i>
<i>-It has a slightly smoky flavor.</i>

598
00:29:23,373 --> 00:29:26,076
AT A LOSS FOR WORDS

599
00:29:28,178 --> 00:29:30,947
The broth is rich and flavorful.

600
00:29:33,917 --> 00:29:37,821
CAN'T STOP EATING
THE BEEF BRISKET <i>JJAMPPONG</i>

601
00:29:41,591 --> 00:29:42,592
Man, it's insane.

602
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,631
Thanks to Chef Yeo,
we had a fantastic experience today.

603
00:29:47,697 --> 00:29:49,766
I can't breathe because I'm so full.

604
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:52,969
I'm full, and I had a proper meal
of traditional Chinese food.

605
00:29:53,036 --> 00:29:55,405
I even learned a lot today.

606
00:29:55,472 --> 00:29:58,508
I'm happy to have spent time
with Master Yeo.

607
00:29:58,575 --> 00:30:01,778
Just stay right by his side
and learn from him.

608
00:30:01,845 --> 00:30:04,481
We're chefs.

609
00:30:04,548 --> 00:30:07,384
If you can have someone supportive
by your side,

610
00:30:08,051 --> 00:30:09,886
that's the best.

611
00:30:10,453 --> 00:30:12,022
When I was young

612
00:30:12,856 --> 00:30:14,858
and when I was about Chef Lim's age,

613
00:30:14,925 --> 00:30:18,728
I think I learned
from amazing mentors and seniors.

614
00:30:19,162 --> 00:30:23,333
I received good advice
and lessons about life from them.

615
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,003
If Chef Lim Taehoon is surrounded
by good people like that,

616
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,806
you will have a bright future
ahead of you.

617
00:30:29,873 --> 00:30:30,941
I'm rooting for you.

618
00:30:31,007 --> 00:30:32,242
Thank you so much.

619
00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:33,677
I only need you by my side.

620
00:30:34,711 --> 00:30:37,113
I learned so much thanks to you.

621
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,583
I'm not an expert in Chinese cuisine,

622
00:30:39,649 --> 00:30:41,685
but I got to enjoy it
and learn new things.

623
00:30:41,751 --> 00:30:44,054
It was a great opportunity
that opened my eyes.

624
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,324
I had fun exploring
a new world of delicious food.

625
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,459
I get why he brought us here.

626
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,763
-What should we do with all the leftovers?
-Let's take them home.

627
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:59,669
In China, if there are no leftovers
after serving your guests,

628
00:30:59,736 --> 00:31:01,838
it means you didn't treat them properly.

629
00:31:01,905 --> 00:31:06,209
So, leaving some food
is considered polite.

630
00:31:06,276 --> 00:31:09,679
TODAY'S GO-TO SPOT SERVED A HEARTY MEAL
THAT EVEN FILLED THEIR HEARTS

631
00:31:09,746 --> 00:31:12,349
Chef, thank you for the delicious meal.

632
00:31:12,415 --> 00:31:13,617
Thank you.

633
00:31:13,683 --> 00:31:15,919
THANK YOU FOR THE MEAL, AS ALWAYS

634
00:31:20,023 --> 00:31:22,492
EPISODE 18:
