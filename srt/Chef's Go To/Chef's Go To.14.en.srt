00:00:01,111 --> 00:00:02,479
THE FOURTH, YOON DUJUN

2
00:00:02,546 --> 00:00:04,180
THE ELDEST, KIM MINSEONG

3
00:00:04,247 --> 00:00:06,182
THE SECOND, DAVID LEE

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,153
<i>-The weather is cooling down.</i>
<i>-I agree.</i>

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,389
<i>I wore my jacket.</i>
<i>It was cold in the morning.</i>

6
00:00:12,455 --> 00:00:14,291
A BREEZE IS BLOWING
OVER SEOKCHON LAKE

7
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:17,027
<i>I hear the crowds screaming.</i>

8
00:00:17,093 --> 00:00:19,629
A MAGICAL THEME PARK IS
FLOATING ABOVE THE LAKE

9
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,232
-It's going to drop.
-Here it goes.

10
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:26,403
VERTICAL DROP

11
00:00:26,469 --> 00:00:27,470
I CAN'T LOOK

12
00:00:27,537 --> 00:00:28,838
Hello, David and Minseong!

13
00:00:29,873 --> 00:00:31,474
-How have you been?
-How's it going?

14
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:33,209
-How is everything?
-It's good.

15
00:00:33,276 --> 00:00:34,578
We are here at Jamsil.

16
00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:37,614
We can hear their screams from behind us.

17
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:40,450
-Do you like rides?
-I'm scared of them.

18
00:00:40,517 --> 00:00:42,052
You couldn't pay me to ride them.

19
00:00:42,552 --> 00:00:45,021
-I'm relieved to hear that.
-It's a "no" for me.

20
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:47,424
Who invited today's chef?

21
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,994
-I invited today's chef.
-All right.

22
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:52,629
Give us a small hint.

23
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,032
-Chef Side Dish.
-What?

24
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,769
There are many chefs with that nickname.

25
00:00:59,836 --> 00:01:02,439
-But he's a rising chef.
-Got it.

26
00:01:02,505 --> 00:01:05,909
If you make side dishes,
you have to be an expert at everything.

27
00:01:05,976 --> 00:01:08,645
-That's right.
-From stir-fried dishes to braised ones.

28
00:01:08,712 --> 00:01:09,980
And have tons of knowledge.

29
00:01:10,046 --> 00:01:13,617
I'm excited to go to the restaurant
that this chef recommends.

30
00:01:13,683 --> 00:01:15,919
-Absolutely.
-It's bound to be good.

31
00:01:15,986 --> 00:01:18,388
-He should be here soon.
-He's a bit late.

32
00:01:19,656 --> 00:01:22,092
A MYSTERIOUS GUY COMES RUNNING FROM AFAR

33
00:01:23,426 --> 00:01:25,095
BUT HE'S TOO SLOW

34
00:01:25,161 --> 00:01:28,732
HE'S SLOWER THAN SOMEONE WHO'S WALKING

35
00:01:28,798 --> 00:01:29,833
LIGHTLY

36
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,934
He's here.

37
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:33,069
Are you running or walking?

38
00:01:33,136 --> 00:01:35,305
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

39
00:01:35,372 --> 00:01:36,439
Hello.

40
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,643
-Hello.
-He looks like Sean from Jinusean.

41
00:01:40,343 --> 00:01:41,778
I thought Sean was running.

42
00:01:41,845 --> 00:01:44,314
Slow jogging is popular these days.

43
00:01:44,381 --> 00:01:47,450
-Really?
-Yes, I exercised before we eat.

44
00:01:47,517 --> 00:01:50,387
I'm Song Haseulram,
and I make side dishes.

45
00:01:50,453 --> 00:01:52,956
-Nice to meet you.
-I'm glad to meet you.

46
00:01:53,924 --> 00:01:57,894
RATHER THAN EXPENSIVE
AND FANCY FINE DINING DISHES

47
00:01:58,495 --> 00:02:01,164
HE MAKES EVERYDAY SIDE DISHES

48
00:02:01,765 --> 00:02:04,768
HE RESEARCHES THE INFINITE POSSIBILITIES
OF FAMILIAR INGREDIENTS

49
00:02:05,535 --> 00:02:08,438
CHEF SIDE DISH, SONG HASEULRAM

50
00:02:08,672 --> 00:02:11,641
I know that you sell side dishes.
How is your store doing?

51
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:14,377
It's in Seongsu-dong.
I sell on the first floor.

52
00:02:14,444 --> 00:02:15,712
The second floor is a pub.

53
00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:17,881
-A side dish pub is cool.
-What's that?

54
00:02:17,948 --> 00:02:20,483
-Are side dishes the bar snacks?
-Exactly.

55
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,285
I used to cook in Spain.

56
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:23,653
-They're like tapas.
-Right.

57
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,556
-I think tapas are similar to side dishes.
-I see.

58
00:02:26,623 --> 00:02:29,526
<i>You can pick the side dishes</i>
<i>and eat them on the second floor.</i>

59
00:02:29,593 --> 00:02:34,464
I've also been receiving requests
to develop dishes with local ingredients,

60
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:36,833
so I'm creating recipes with them.

61
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,034
That's awesome.

62
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:42,872
You're here to introduce your go-to place.
Can you tell us about it?

63
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:47,310
Since I usually make side dishes,
I can guarantee that they are great.

64
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:53,550
And the rice that complements
the side dishes is absolutely scrumptious.

65
00:02:53,617 --> 00:02:55,552
A side-dish chef guarantees others' sides.

66
00:02:55,619 --> 00:02:57,487
-He's piqued my curiosity.
-Same.

67
00:02:57,554 --> 00:03:00,156
-You must have high standards.
-I'm excited.

68
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:02,392
I'm sure you will all love it.

69
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,795
It's a ten-minute walk from Seokchon Lake.

70
00:03:05,862 --> 00:03:09,199
-It's nearby.
-How long will it take if we slow jog?

71
00:03:09,266 --> 00:03:11,568
-If we slow-jog…
-About 30 minutes?

72
00:03:12,335 --> 00:03:14,204
-Thirty minutes?
-Then let's slow jog.

73
00:03:14,271 --> 00:03:16,740
-Let's go.
-Off we go.

74
00:03:16,806 --> 00:03:19,542
I feel like walking would be faster.

75
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:22,145
Power walking is way faster, isn't it?

76
00:03:22,212 --> 00:03:25,649
-My knees are starting to hurt.
-Mine too.

77
00:03:25,715 --> 00:03:28,018
-I'm just going to walk.
-Let's go eat.

78
00:03:28,084 --> 00:03:29,219
EXERCISING BEFORE EATING

79
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,055
<i>The weather is amazing.</i>

80
00:03:32,656 --> 00:03:36,026
<i>-It suddenly cooled down.</i>
<i>-It sure did.</i>

81
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,195
<i>This is an intersection</i>
<i>with many academies.</i>

82
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:41,298
<i>-There are so many of them.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

83
00:03:41,364 --> 00:03:44,534
<i>I see math, English, concept-focused,</i>
<i>and creative learning academies.</i>

84
00:03:45,368 --> 00:03:50,273
This neighborhood has been here
for a long time,

85
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,842
so there are
many hidden old-school eateries here.

86
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:54,411
You bet.

87
00:03:55,312 --> 00:03:57,814
Where is today's go-to spot?

88
00:03:58,715 --> 00:04:01,318
-It's right over there.
-"Ahn Jae Korean Restaurant"?

89
00:04:01,384 --> 00:04:02,385
<i>That's right.</i>

90
00:04:05,388 --> 00:04:06,656
THEY SELL KOREAN FOOD

91
00:04:06,723 --> 00:04:07,991
It looks neat.

92
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,860
It just has a simple sign.

93
00:04:11,928 --> 00:04:13,563
FINALLY ARRIVED

94
00:04:14,164 --> 00:04:16,833
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello, sir.

95
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,168
We also met a few days ago.

96
00:04:18,235 --> 00:04:19,769
AHN JAEMAN, OWNER

97
00:04:19,836 --> 00:04:22,973
-Hello.
-I feel like we're friends.

98
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:25,041
THE OWNER ALSO HAS A SHAVED HEAD

99
00:04:25,108 --> 00:04:27,711
<i>The restaurant is nice and neat.</i>

100
00:04:27,777 --> 00:04:29,813
<i>And you can tell they sell Korean food.</i>

101
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,816
<i>-It looks like they have stone pot rice.</i>
<i>-Really?</i>

102
00:04:32,883 --> 00:04:34,851
<i>"Stone pot rice made fresh</i>
<i>from good rice."</i>

103
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:37,554
<i>-I love it.</i>
<i>-I haven't had it in a long time.</i>

104
00:04:37,621 --> 00:04:38,722
<i>I'm excited to try it.</i>

105
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:42,792
I'll take care of ordering the food.

106
00:04:42,859 --> 00:04:44,461
-That's the best.
-Absolutely.

107
00:04:44,527 --> 00:04:46,196
I love it when the chef orders.

108
00:04:46,263 --> 00:04:47,364
-Sir.
-Yes.

109
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,099
He's confident about his choices.

110
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:51,167
-We'll order four basic set meals.
-Sure.

111
00:04:51,234 --> 00:04:55,605
And 400 grams of Eonyang-style
charcoal-grilled bulgogi, please.

112
00:04:55,672 --> 00:04:57,574
Got it. I will prepare them with care.

113
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:59,075
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

114
00:04:59,142 --> 00:05:00,310
GLAD TO SEE A SHAVED HEAD

115
00:05:00,377 --> 00:05:03,980
How did you become a regular
at this restaurant?

116
00:05:04,047 --> 00:05:07,817
I heard of a restaurant
that gets high-quality ingredients

117
00:05:07,884 --> 00:05:10,954
from all over the country
and makes its own side dishes.

118
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:12,822
I sell side dishes, so I was curious.

119
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:15,859
I loved the food here,
so I come once in a while.

120
00:05:15,926 --> 00:05:18,828
What side dish would you pick
if you had to eat only one?

121
00:05:18,895 --> 00:05:22,465
-I love leaf mustard kimchi.
-It's the god of kimchi.

122
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:24,200
That's hilarious.

123
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:26,870
I'll serve the side dishes first.

124
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:29,272
WOW

125
00:05:30,507 --> 00:05:32,776
-That's the leaf mustard kimchi.
-It sure is.

126
00:05:33,243 --> 00:05:34,244
Enjoy.

127
00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:37,747
-Can you introduce them to us?
-Of course.

128
00:05:37,814 --> 00:05:40,383
You probably already know this,
but it's from Yeosu.

129
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:44,054
-It's kimchi from Yeosu.
-It's the best.

130
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,155
LEAF MUSTARD KIMCHI

131
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:47,257
<i>And these are pine mushrooms.</i>

132
00:05:47,324 --> 00:05:48,558
BRAISED PINE MUSHROOM

133
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,961
<i>This is Gwangcheon salted baby octopus.</i>

134
00:05:52,462 --> 00:05:56,333
<i>Pickled chili and seasoned chili</i>
<i>made from chilis sourced from Miryang.</i>

135
00:05:57,434 --> 00:05:58,902
<i>Stir-fried summer squash.</i>

136
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:00,170
<i>My mouth is watering.</i>

137
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,806
<i>The </i>jangjorim <i>looks amazing.</i>

138
00:06:02,872 --> 00:06:04,074
KOREAN BEEF <i>JANGJORIM</i>

139
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,144
<i>And seasoned young radish greens</i>
<i>from Pocheon.</i>

140
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:09,779
WOW

141
00:06:09,846 --> 00:06:12,582
-And there are more side dishes.
-Where are they?

142
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:15,018
-Let's get them together.
-Sure.

143
00:06:15,485 --> 00:06:16,553
WHOA

144
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,621
Look here.

145
00:06:19,256 --> 00:06:20,390
You can have refills.

146
00:06:20,457 --> 00:06:22,826
-Can you get unlimited refills?
-Definitely.

147
00:06:25,495 --> 00:06:27,964
PLEASE FEEL FREE
TO HELP YOURSELF TO REFILLS

148
00:06:28,398 --> 00:06:29,733
<i>Get a ton of everything.</i>

149
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:31,067
UNLIMITED REFILLS

150
00:06:31,134 --> 00:06:33,837
-Get heaps of it.
-There's everything here.

151
00:06:33,904 --> 00:06:35,138
This one is new.

152
00:06:35,205 --> 00:06:38,408
Right, these are
eggplant kimchi and <i>geotjeori</i>.

153
00:06:40,043 --> 00:06:43,480
-I'll get the <i>geotjeori</i>. Looks delicious.
-I'll get the eggplant kimchi.

154
00:06:43,547 --> 00:06:44,681
MORE SIDE DISHES

155
00:06:44,748 --> 00:06:46,249
Eggplant kimchi is interesting.

156
00:06:46,316 --> 00:06:47,851
TWO MORE SIDE DISHES COMING

157
00:06:49,886 --> 00:06:51,021
Ta-da.

158
00:06:51,087 --> 00:06:53,023
We brought eggplant kimchi and <i>geotjeori</i>.

159
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:54,391
TEN SIDE DISHES ARE SERVED

160
00:06:55,058 --> 00:06:58,161
<i>-Let's try each one's favorite one.</i>
<i>-Sure.</i>

161
00:07:00,497 --> 00:07:03,099
You know, I'm from Jeolla-do.

162
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,869
My family home is in Suncheon and Yeosu.

163
00:07:05,936 --> 00:07:07,504
-I'll start with this.
-Of course.

164
00:07:07,571 --> 00:07:09,472
CHOOSES THE YEOSU LEAF MUSTARD KIMCHI

165
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:16,079
YUM

166
00:07:22,252 --> 00:07:24,821
I just had the leaf mustard kimchi.

167
00:07:25,522 --> 00:07:26,923
And I can't stop eating it.

168
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,426
<i>It's like how my mom used to make it.</i>

169
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:31,061
<i>-Really?</i>
<i>-It's nice and clean.</i>

170
00:07:32,028 --> 00:07:35,098
The unique aroma
of the leaf mustard comes through.

171
00:07:35,165 --> 00:07:36,600
It's perfectly fermented.

172
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,469
You can really taste
the natural ingredients.

173
00:07:41,037 --> 00:07:42,038
<i>I'm loving this.</i>

174
00:07:42,105 --> 00:07:44,808
THE YEOSU LEAF MUSTARD KIMCHI
HAS A PIQUANT AFTERTASTE

175
00:07:44,874 --> 00:07:48,178
I want to try
the stir-fried summer squash.

176
00:07:48,245 --> 00:07:51,314
I loved it whenever my mom
made this side dish.

177
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:52,716
<i>I should compare them.</i>

178
00:07:52,782 --> 00:07:55,085
WILL IT SUIT DUJUN'S TASTE?

179
00:07:57,754 --> 00:08:01,391
-Is it good?
-Oh, it just melts in my mouth.

180
00:08:02,993 --> 00:08:04,227
It tastes incredible.

181
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:09,099
The summer squash is unbelievable.

182
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:11,067
It's nicely stir-fried and seasoned.

183
00:08:11,134 --> 00:08:15,105
-What's unique about this is that--
-It's sliced thick.

184
00:08:15,171 --> 00:08:16,873
Yes, it's thicker than other places.

185
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,777
<i>He slices it thick on purpose</i>
<i>so we can taste the sweetness.</i>

186
00:08:21,811 --> 00:08:24,014
<i>Looking at these side dishes,</i>

187
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,350
<i>I can tell the owner wants to bring out</i>

188
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:31,121
<i>the natural flavors of the ingredients.</i>

189
00:08:32,622 --> 00:08:36,059
HE LIGHTLY STIR-FRIES THE SUMMER SQUASH

190
00:08:36,126 --> 00:08:39,563
HE ADDS MINCED GARLIC

191
00:08:40,897 --> 00:08:44,534
HE ADDS THE SPECIAL INGREDIENT,
SALTED SHRIMP

192
00:08:46,303 --> 00:08:49,839
HE STIR-FRIES IT AGAIN, AND IT'S READY

193
00:08:53,043 --> 00:08:55,178
<i>The sweetness from the shrimp shines.</i>

194
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:57,681
And then the saltiness kicks in.

195
00:08:57,747 --> 00:09:00,884
Of all the salted shrimps,
like <i>ojeot, yukjeot, chujeot,</i>

196
00:09:00,951 --> 00:09:03,720
<i>yukjeot </i>is regarded as the best.

197
00:09:03,787 --> 00:09:05,121
<i>Why is it called </i>yukjeot<i>?</i>

198
00:09:05,188 --> 00:09:07,390
<i>Because it's made with June shrimp.</i>

199
00:09:07,457 --> 00:09:11,061
<i>The shrimp are at their fullest in June.</i>

200
00:09:11,127 --> 00:09:13,230
<i>Its sweetness fills your mouth.</i>

201
00:09:13,296 --> 00:09:16,600
<i>If you make salted shrimp with it,</i>
<i>the juice is sweet as well.</i>

202
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,401
UNBELIEVABLY RICH WITH UMAMI

203
00:09:18,468 --> 00:09:24,708
I don't think I've ever seen <i>yukjeot</i>
this big used in ordinary side dishes.

204
00:09:24,774 --> 00:09:28,912
This isn't just a common side dish
you eat with rice.

205
00:09:28,979 --> 00:09:31,848
This side dish is like a main dish.

206
00:09:31,915 --> 00:09:35,819
<i>That's why I think he used</i>
<i>this expensive </i>yukjeot <i>to season this.</i>

207
00:09:37,454 --> 00:09:40,190
I can't help it. I have to try this one.

208
00:09:40,257 --> 00:09:42,292
-The pine mushroom?
-Let's try this.

209
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:44,494
I'm curious how this will taste.

210
00:09:44,561 --> 00:09:46,062
MINSEONG TRIES THE PINE MUSHROOM

211
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:48,899
-It looks like he's chewing on meat.
-I agree.

212
00:09:48,965 --> 00:09:50,433
I should try it, too.

213
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,570
THE FOODIE BROTHERS ALL TAKE A BITE

214
00:09:58,675 --> 00:10:00,310
Wow, it's incredibly tender.

215
00:10:00,377 --> 00:10:01,611
It's amazing.

216
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:06,650
It looks like he didn't use
too much oil to make this.

217
00:10:06,716 --> 00:10:10,387
<i>He just stir-fried them</i>
<i>with a bit of oil and water in a pan.</i>

218
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:16,660
HE ADDS IN PLENTY OF SOY SAUCE

219
00:10:17,527 --> 00:10:20,330
HE SIMMERS THEM UNTIL THEY TURN BROWN

220
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,169
THE YANGPYEONG
BRAISED PINE MUSHROOM ARE READY

221
00:10:26,236 --> 00:10:28,605
I'm not familiar with pine mushroom.

222
00:10:28,672 --> 00:10:29,806
What is it like?

223
00:10:29,873 --> 00:10:32,409
<i>It's more chewy</i>
<i>than an ordinary shiitake mushroom.</i>

224
00:10:32,475 --> 00:10:34,544
<i>It has a firm texture.</i>

225
00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:38,648
<i>Shiitake mushrooms are more common</i>
<i>because pine mushrooms are expensive.</i>

226
00:10:39,182 --> 00:10:42,419
You don't need meat
if you have mushrooms like these.

227
00:10:42,485 --> 00:10:45,021
They'd be perfect
with just rice and kimchi.

228
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,691
<i>This is excellent.</i>

229
00:10:47,757 --> 00:10:50,727
THIS SIDE DISH TAKES MUSHROOMS
TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL

230
00:10:50,794 --> 00:10:54,231
I'll choose the seasoned
young radish greens.

231
00:10:54,297 --> 00:10:55,966
-Let's try it.
-You try it first.

232
00:10:56,032 --> 00:11:00,403
<i>I love the fragrance of young radish,</i>
<i>so I'll try this.</i>

233
00:11:01,805 --> 00:11:02,973
It's tender.

234
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,042
-The aroma is nice.
-Right.

235
00:11:06,943 --> 00:11:10,814
HOW DOES THIS SIDE DISH TASTE?

236
00:11:10,881 --> 00:11:11,882
It's refreshing.

237
00:11:13,516 --> 00:11:16,987
DUJUN ALSO TAKES A BITE

238
00:11:17,554 --> 00:11:20,624
How do I put this? It tastes fresh.

239
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,359
This is the stuff.

240
00:11:22,993 --> 00:11:25,929
It's like Korean arugula.

241
00:11:25,996 --> 00:11:27,664
-Exactly.
-It's quite peppery.

242
00:11:27,731 --> 00:11:28,798
Absolutely.

243
00:11:28,865 --> 00:11:31,434
People love young radish greens.

244
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:35,639
The younger the greens,
the spicier they are at the end.

245
00:11:35,705 --> 00:11:39,209
<i>It's rare to eat young radish greens</i>
<i>as a salad like this.</i>

246
00:11:39,776 --> 00:11:41,411
<i>-It's very tender.</i>
<i>-It's so good.</i>

247
00:11:41,478 --> 00:11:44,714
<i>-You have to use the new sprouts.</i>
<i>-Definitely.</i>

248
00:11:44,781 --> 00:11:49,553
In Jeolla-do, they wrap sashimi
and even meat in young radish.

249
00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:51,187
-Really?
-Yes, they do that.

250
00:11:51,254 --> 00:11:53,490
It's served when you go
to a <i>ssambap </i>restaurant.

251
00:11:54,357 --> 00:11:57,928
<i>At first, you think it's arugula,</i>
<i>but it's just young radish.</i>

252
00:11:57,994 --> 00:12:00,664
Gosh, since you're experts,
you explain it so well.

253
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:06,236
And the owner received green plum syrup
made by his mother in Miryang.

254
00:12:06,303 --> 00:12:10,407
<i>It's homemade green plum syrup,</i>
<i>which he uses as a dressing.</i>

255
00:12:10,473 --> 00:12:13,577
<i>This green plum syrup tastes</i>
<i>like fresh tomatoes.</i>

256
00:12:13,643 --> 00:12:16,746
-Yes, there's also garlic.
-I thought he mixed in tomato juice.

257
00:12:17,347 --> 00:12:21,585
So, this cleanses your palate
before you eat the other dishes.

258
00:12:21,651 --> 00:12:23,887
<i>And then you can eat</i>
<i>the rest of your meal.</i>

259
00:12:23,954 --> 00:12:25,455
ACTS AS AN APPETIZER

260
00:12:26,289 --> 00:12:28,892
This is bad.
I'm going to need so much rice for this.

261
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,427
REMARKABLE SIDE DISHES

262
00:12:30,493 --> 00:12:32,729
The owner gets the ingredients

263
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:36,499
from all over the country
and prepares them.

264
00:12:36,566 --> 00:12:39,135
For the Gwangcheon salted baby octopus,

265
00:12:39,202 --> 00:12:41,638
<i>he goes to Gwangcheon himself</i>
<i>to get the ingredients.</i>

266
00:12:41,705 --> 00:12:44,174
<i>He has done business</i>
<i>with them for seven years,</i>

267
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:46,276
<i>so he only gets it from them.</i>

268
00:12:46,843 --> 00:12:53,183
SIDE DISHES MADE FROM LOCAL INGREDIENTS
FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY

269
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,853
At first, it's challenging
to find new suppliers.

270
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,822
-It's very difficult.
-Right.

271
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:00,991
-It's hard to find good ingredients.
-True.

272
00:13:01,057 --> 00:13:03,493
It's even harder
to constantly do business with them.

273
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,130
-That's the hardest part.
-It's such a hassle every time.

274
00:13:07,197 --> 00:13:08,832
-He knows all about it.
-I agree.

275
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:11,668
<i>It's hard when you have lots of suppliers.</i>

276
00:13:11,735 --> 00:13:13,403
<i>Wow, I can't even imagine.</i>

277
00:13:14,004 --> 00:13:15,605
I'm obsessed with these dishes.

278
00:13:16,072 --> 00:13:17,474
-Bring rice.
-I'm craving more.

279
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,142
When will the rice come out?

280
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:21,645
STONE POT RICE FOR THE FOODIE BROTHERS

281
00:13:21,711 --> 00:13:24,014
COOKS FOR EIGHT MINUTES

282
00:13:24,948 --> 00:13:28,785
ON MY WAY TO MEET YOU

283
00:13:29,553 --> 00:13:31,221
Wow, it's here.

284
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:33,290
The stone pot rice is ready.

285
00:13:33,356 --> 00:13:35,492
-It's Suhyangmi stone pot rice.
-Thank you.

286
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:36,793
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

287
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,495
Be careful. It's hot.

288
00:13:38,562 --> 00:13:40,130
There's no scorched rice in there.

289
00:13:40,196 --> 00:13:44,067
It's Suhyangmi stone pot rice
without the scorched rice?

290
00:13:44,134 --> 00:13:47,404
-Right, we don't scorch the rice.
-I see.

291
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,506
-Is there a reason for that?
-Yes.

292
00:13:49,573 --> 00:13:51,408
Is it because of the smell?

293
00:13:51,474 --> 00:13:53,009
That's one reason.

294
00:13:53,076 --> 00:13:55,712
The other reason is that
if you heat it over high heat,

295
00:13:55,779 --> 00:13:57,881
it overcooks,
and the texture just isn't great.

296
00:13:57,948 --> 00:14:01,818
So, I wanted to preserve the texture
and fragrance of the rice.

297
00:14:01,885 --> 00:14:03,853
<i>-That's why I don't scorch the rice.</i>
<i>-I see.</i>

298
00:14:05,522 --> 00:14:08,291
The rice smells so rich and nice.

299
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,795
<i>It smells nutty.</i>

300
00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:13,930
GIVES OFF A DEEP, FRAGRANT AROMA

301
00:14:14,598 --> 00:14:18,201
I made this barley tea
from the barley my mother grew.

302
00:14:18,768 --> 00:14:21,705
Add the barley tea
so you can drink it like <i>sungnyung</i>.

303
00:14:21,771 --> 00:14:24,107
-That sounds great.
-That's a good idea.

304
00:14:25,141 --> 00:14:26,376
Is there soup as well?

305
00:14:26,443 --> 00:14:28,211
DRIED POLLACK SEAWEED SOUP

306
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:33,783
Is there a reason you source local
ingredients from all over the country?

307
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:39,222
Vegetables and other ingredients
are auctioned and sent to wholesalers.

308
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:42,959
<i>And in the process,</i>
<i>they lose their original flavor.</i>

309
00:14:44,895 --> 00:14:48,331
<i>So that's why we always</i>
<i>source them straight from the farm.</i>

310
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,968
You must have very high standards.

311
00:14:52,035 --> 00:14:55,372
The last time I came here,
he boiled the bamboo shoots himself.

312
00:14:55,438 --> 00:14:57,107
<i>-Really?</i>
<i>-That's right.</i>

313
00:14:57,173 --> 00:15:00,377
<i>He seasoned them with perilla powder,</i>
<i>which was so good.</i>

314
00:15:01,311 --> 00:15:03,313
I want to serve you
some other side dishes.

315
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:07,250
So, I would love to bring out
some of the autumnal side dishes

316
00:15:07,317 --> 00:15:11,555
and the pickled wild greens
we served in the spring.

317
00:15:11,621 --> 00:15:13,623
-Really?
-It's an honor.

318
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:18,228
These are chili chips made from chilis
my mother dried in Miryang.

319
00:15:18,295 --> 00:15:20,497
-Okay.
-It's made with chilis.

320
00:15:20,564 --> 00:15:22,532
-And this is--
-Dried persimmons!

321
00:15:22,599 --> 00:15:25,001
MIRYANG PICKLED DRIED PERSIMMONS

322
00:15:25,068 --> 00:15:29,306
And these are <i>ogapisun</i>
picked in the Gyeryongsan Mountain.

323
00:15:29,372 --> 00:15:31,274
An herbalist there sends them to me.

324
00:15:31,341 --> 00:15:32,976
This is all that's left.

325
00:15:33,043 --> 00:15:34,778
There will be more next year.

326
00:15:34,844 --> 00:15:37,480
-Wow, thank you.
-We're lucky to have these.

327
00:15:37,547 --> 00:15:39,049
The rice is the main dish.

328
00:15:39,115 --> 00:15:42,252
Why don't you try the rice and soup first?

329
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:43,987
-All right.
-Got it.

330
00:15:44,054 --> 00:15:45,689
TAKES A BITE

331
00:15:48,225 --> 00:15:49,793
It's so nutty.

332
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:59,836
What makes Suhyangmi so different?
The aroma is very rich and intense.

333
00:15:59,903 --> 00:16:03,306
There are more kinds of rice these days.

334
00:16:03,373 --> 00:16:05,408
-That's right.
-It has a nice aroma.

335
00:16:05,475 --> 00:16:10,447
<i>And this rice is more moist and sticky</i>
<i>when compared to other varieties.</i>

336
00:16:11,081 --> 00:16:12,182
Like the owner said,

337
00:16:12,249 --> 00:16:15,318
if you try to overheat this
to make scorched rice,

338
00:16:15,385 --> 00:16:18,188
I think it will interfere
with the rice's natural aroma.

339
00:16:19,422 --> 00:16:21,858
-Is this dried pollack seaweed soup?
-Yes, it's good.

340
00:16:21,925 --> 00:16:25,328
TIME TO TRY THE DRIED POLLACK SEAWEED SOUP

341
00:16:25,395 --> 00:16:26,796
This is top-quality soup.

342
00:16:27,931 --> 00:16:30,000
How is the soup, everyone? I love it.

343
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:32,068
It's light and tasty.

344
00:16:32,135 --> 00:16:35,739
<i>He only used dried pollack and seaweed,</i>
<i>so it's very light.</i>

345
00:16:36,273 --> 00:16:37,908
<i>It's not too strong.</i>

346
00:16:37,974 --> 00:16:40,477
I feel like it balances out
the other dishes.

347
00:16:40,544 --> 00:16:44,014
The overall seasoning isn't too strong.

348
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,282
It goes down easily.

349
00:16:45,882 --> 00:16:46,983
And it's fantastic.

350
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:50,887
HOW DO THE SEASONAL SIDES TASTE?

351
00:16:50,954 --> 00:16:53,189
<i>Are these the new ones</i>
<i>the owner served us?</i>

352
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:57,227
-What did he say this was?
-Pickled dried persimmons.

353
00:16:57,294 --> 00:16:58,295
DRIED PERSIMMONS

354
00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:00,897
Whoa, try this side dish.

355
00:17:01,765 --> 00:17:03,099
It's spicier than I expected.

356
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,003
He mixed dried persimmons with gochujang.

357
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,439
COMBINED DRIED PERSIMMONS WITH GOCHUJANG

358
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,143
PICKED PERSIMMONS GROWN
UNDER THE HOT MIRYANG SUN

359
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:15,445
MADE INTO DRIED PERSIMMONS

360
00:17:15,512 --> 00:17:16,980
<i>The dried persimmons are sweet.</i>

361
00:17:17,047 --> 00:17:19,616
<i>The owner enjoys natural sweet flavors.</i>

362
00:17:19,683 --> 00:17:22,886
<i>He mixed them</i>
<i>with green plum syrup gochujang.</i>

363
00:17:22,953 --> 00:17:25,388
<i>-I can smell the green plum.</i>
<i>-Me too.</i>

364
00:17:28,258 --> 00:17:32,162
THE MIRYANG PICKLED DRIED PERSIMMONS
ARE READY

365
00:17:32,229 --> 00:17:35,732
If you taste the food here,
you won't find any artificial sweetness.

366
00:17:36,366 --> 00:17:39,769
I like the fact that the flavors
come entirely from the natural sweetness

367
00:17:39,836 --> 00:17:42,472
of the vegetables and other ingredients.

368
00:17:43,106 --> 00:17:45,408
-Shall we try the <i>ogapi?</i>
-Sure.

369
00:17:45,942 --> 00:17:47,210
-Have you seen this?
-No.

370
00:17:47,277 --> 00:17:49,512
I've never seen
pickled thorny <i>ogapi, </i>either.

371
00:17:54,284 --> 00:17:55,352
Oh, the fragrance…

372
00:17:57,654 --> 00:17:58,688
The <i>ogapi…</i>

373
00:17:58,755 --> 00:18:00,657
Is the scent coming from the <i>ogapi?</i>

374
00:18:00,724 --> 00:18:02,626
It's very aromatic.

375
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,861
How can I explain this smell?

376
00:18:06,763 --> 00:18:11,434
It has that unique bitterness
and aroma that wild greens have.

377
00:18:11,501 --> 00:18:13,270
-It's extremely appealing.
-Look.

378
00:18:13,336 --> 00:18:15,705
This would be the fanciest side dish here.

379
00:18:15,772 --> 00:18:16,873
Wow, this is…

380
00:18:17,941 --> 00:18:20,310
<i>Ogapi </i>has all sorts of scents.

381
00:18:20,844 --> 00:18:24,180
<i>You can smell the aroma</i>
<i>even from just a small bite.</i>

382
00:18:24,247 --> 00:18:25,248
<i>It's so cool.</i>

383
00:18:25,949 --> 00:18:28,351
Wow, I'm in trouble.
I'm going to need so much rice.

384
00:18:30,253 --> 00:18:34,991
A SCOOP OF RICE WITH PICKLED THORNY <i>OGAPI</i>

385
00:18:35,692 --> 00:18:41,364
ANOTHER SCOOP OF RICE
WITH SOY-BRAISED CHILI

386
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:44,868
Salted baby octopus
on a spoonful of warm Suhyangmi rice.

387
00:18:44,935 --> 00:18:48,972
A SCOOP OF RICE WITH SALTED BABY OCTOPUS

388
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,408
This is a work of art.

389
00:18:52,509 --> 00:18:53,910
A PIECE OF EGGPLANT KIMCHI

390
00:18:53,977 --> 00:18:56,513
<i>I've never heard of eggplant kimchi.</i>
<i>This is cool.</i>

391
00:18:59,316 --> 00:19:01,017
I'm loving the wild greens.

392
00:19:01,585 --> 00:19:04,120
<i>There isn't much texture</i>
<i>if there's only eggplant,</i>

393
00:19:04,187 --> 00:19:06,189
<i>so he added chives.</i>

394
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:10,927
We need a foreign guest on the show.

395
00:19:11,528 --> 00:19:13,129
-To bring them here?
-Exactly.

396
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:19,035
What led you to become a chef
specializing in side dishes?

397
00:19:19,102 --> 00:19:21,271
I used to work
in a fine dining restaurant.

398
00:19:21,338 --> 00:19:25,542
I spent some time cooking
in a M*chelin restaurant in Spain.

399
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:28,411
<i>I used to cook in a M*chelin restaurant</i>
<i>in Korea as well.</i>

400
00:19:29,346 --> 00:19:33,416
Fine dining restaurants
are often hard to access

401
00:19:33,483 --> 00:19:35,886
due to price and other factors.

402
00:19:35,952 --> 00:19:40,223
"How could I make my food
accessible to more people?"

403
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,726
I kept contemplating this.

404
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:46,029
<i>Even if they aren't</i>
<i>the ingredients we usually eat,</i>

405
00:19:46,096 --> 00:19:48,298
<i>I wanted to use them in Korean dishes.</i>

406
00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:50,133
<i>So I decided to run a side dish store.</i>

407
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,801
HE USES UNFAMILIAR INGREDIENTS

408
00:19:51,868 --> 00:19:55,272
Is it common for chefs to switch careers
and start making side dishes?

409
00:19:55,338 --> 00:19:57,474
It hardly ever happens.

410
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,177
There aren't many chefs who want
to take the time to research ingredients.

411
00:20:01,912 --> 00:20:04,114
Here is the main dish.

412
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,483
This is Eonyang-style bulgogi.

413
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,651
TODAY'S MAIN MENU

414
00:20:07,717 --> 00:20:09,085
This looks insane.

415
00:20:09,152 --> 00:20:10,220
My mouth is watering.

416
00:20:11,721 --> 00:20:16,126
ALL OF THE DISHES ARE FINALLY SERVED

417
00:20:16,793 --> 00:20:19,563
I'm taking a high-angle shot.
It's the trend these days.

418
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,865
<i>The whole table has to be in full view.</i>

419
00:20:21,932 --> 00:20:23,366
A TABLE FULL OF SIDE DISHES

420
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:26,403
-I can smell the charcoal.
-The scent rises.

421
00:20:26,937 --> 00:20:29,239
It's different from the bulgogi
we usually eat.

422
00:20:29,306 --> 00:20:30,941
It looks extremely crispy.

423
00:20:31,575 --> 00:20:34,477
This is called crispy bulgogi.

424
00:20:34,544 --> 00:20:35,979
-In fact…
-I've heard it before.

425
00:20:36,046 --> 00:20:39,216
Eonyang-style bulgogi is crispy bulgogi.

426
00:20:39,282 --> 00:20:42,185
There are three types of bulgogi
in this country.

427
00:20:42,252 --> 00:20:43,720
<i>First, Seoul-style bulgogi,</i>

428
00:20:43,787 --> 00:20:46,156
<i>which has a bit of broth, veggies,</i>
<i>and glass noodles.</i>

429
00:20:46,223 --> 00:20:48,959
ADD VEGGIES AND GLASS NOODLES
TO THE BROTH AND LET IT SIMMER

430
00:20:50,427 --> 00:20:51,995
<i>Second, Gwangyang-style bulgogi.</i>

431
00:20:52,062 --> 00:20:55,699
<i>It's not marinated in advance</i>
<i>like spicy stir-fried meat.</i>

432
00:20:55,765 --> 00:20:58,969
<i>You season it on the spot and grill it.</i>

433
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:03,240
<i>Lastly, Eonyang-style bulgogi.</i>

434
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,842
<i>Marinate it and grill it</i>
<i>until it's crispy.</i>

435
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:08,678
MARINATE THINLY SLICED MEAT
AND COOK UNTIL CRISPY

436
00:21:09,379 --> 00:21:11,548
This is Eonyang-style bulgogi
among the three.

437
00:21:11,615 --> 00:21:13,550
This is premium Korean beef.

438
00:21:13,617 --> 00:21:15,018
TOP-QUALITY KOREAN BEEF

439
00:21:15,085 --> 00:21:17,888
<i>-It's made with top round beef.</i>
<i>-This is a luxury.</i>

440
00:21:17,954 --> 00:21:19,289
TIME FOR A TASTY TREAT

441
00:21:19,356 --> 00:21:20,757
Let me try it.

442
00:21:21,892 --> 00:21:23,526
I love the smoky aroma.

443
00:21:23,593 --> 00:21:25,795
TAKES A BITE WHILE ENJOYING THE SMELL

444
00:21:29,532 --> 00:21:30,901
Wow, it's scrumptious.

445
00:21:31,668 --> 00:21:32,869
How is it, Minseong?

446
00:21:33,937 --> 00:21:35,038
Don't talk to me.

447
00:21:35,105 --> 00:21:36,473
AT A LOSS FOR WORDS

448
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:38,508
This sweetness brings me joy.

449
00:21:38,575 --> 00:21:39,643
It tastes healthy.

450
00:21:39,709 --> 00:21:40,977
-It's not too strong.
-No.

451
00:21:41,044 --> 00:21:45,448
The key lies in how he balances
the sweetness.

452
00:21:45,515 --> 00:21:50,420
And the secret to this bulgogi
is that he doesn't use soy sauce in it.

453
00:21:50,487 --> 00:21:52,055
Wait, he didn't use soy sauce?

454
00:21:52,122 --> 00:21:53,189
-No.
-Then what…

455
00:21:54,391 --> 00:21:57,460
BULGOGI IS GRILLED
OVER HIGH-QUALITY CHARCOAL

456
00:21:58,895 --> 00:22:02,032
A DELICATE, SWEET AROMA SEEPS THROUGH

457
00:22:03,633 --> 00:22:07,037
<i>It's seasoned with salt</i>
<i>that has been refined for eight years.</i>

458
00:22:07,103 --> 00:22:09,973
<i>The owner adds green plum syrup</i>
<i>for sweetness.</i>

459
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,343
<i>And it's grilled over charcoal right away.</i>

460
00:22:14,411 --> 00:22:18,248
THIS COMBINATION ENHANCES
THE NATURAL FLAVOR OF THE MEAT

461
00:22:18,315 --> 00:22:20,116
<i>Bulgogi is usually sweet.</i>

462
00:22:20,183 --> 00:22:23,186
<i>-Is the sweetness from green plum syrup?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

463
00:22:24,054 --> 00:22:25,789
<i>I can keep eating this.</i>

464
00:22:25,855 --> 00:22:27,958
The smoky aroma is amazing.

465
00:22:29,993 --> 00:22:33,029
Why don't you try the bulgogi
with the young radish?

466
00:22:33,096 --> 00:22:35,398
-Sure.
-It's a great pairing.

467
00:22:35,465 --> 00:22:37,200
-Let me try it.
-Yes.

468
00:22:37,267 --> 00:22:40,103
Place a piece of bulgogi on top.

469
00:22:40,704 --> 00:22:43,173
-Bulgogi and…
-Add a bit of salted baby octopus.

470
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,942
-Really?
-Yes, add a bit on top.

471
00:22:46,843 --> 00:22:48,345
I'll wrap it with this.

472
00:22:48,411 --> 00:22:54,050
WRAP EVERYTHING UP
IN POCHEON SEASONED YOUNG RADISH GREENS

473
00:22:58,655 --> 00:23:02,192
It pairs well with the refreshing
young radish greens.

474
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:03,894
It's so yummy.

475
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:08,365
DUJUN ADDS THE SALTED BABY OCTOPUS
ON TOP LIKE DAVID

476
00:23:09,466 --> 00:23:12,335
Sir, can we get
more salted baby octopus and…

477
00:23:12,402 --> 00:23:14,971
-I'll get some more.
-Oh, is it self-service?

478
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:17,507
-Yes.
-Let's get some more summer squash.

479
00:23:18,174 --> 00:23:19,542
What else do we need?

480
00:23:19,609 --> 00:23:21,344
Let's stop here. No need to be greedy.

481
00:23:21,411 --> 00:23:22,946
We shouldn't waste food.

482
00:23:23,013 --> 00:23:24,814
SCOOPS SOME SALTED BABY OCTOPUS

483
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:27,584
We need more summer squash.
Take a generous portion.

484
00:23:27,651 --> 00:23:30,487
-Yes, I'll get a lot.
-It tastes unbelievable.

485
00:23:31,655 --> 00:23:35,091
ADDICTIVE SUMMER SQUASH

486
00:23:35,158 --> 00:23:38,762
This is the best side dish I've had today.

487
00:23:38,828 --> 00:23:40,597
-The summer squash?
-Yes.

488
00:23:40,664 --> 00:23:41,765
I'm obsessed with it.

489
00:23:41,831 --> 00:23:42,966
ONE MORE BITE

490
00:23:43,033 --> 00:23:45,702
The salted shrimp
is salty and sweet as well.

491
00:23:46,236 --> 00:23:47,437
It's perfectly balanced.

492
00:23:48,104 --> 00:23:50,774
If side dishes were served
in other countries,

493
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,242
no one would eat them.

494
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:54,144
They would wait for the main dish.

495
00:23:54,211 --> 00:23:59,049
Are foreigners not familiar
with the concept of side dishes?

496
00:23:59,115 --> 00:24:01,351
They're not.
They think that, if they eat them,

497
00:24:01,952 --> 00:24:04,354
they will be charged for the sides.

498
00:24:04,421 --> 00:24:05,922
They'd be curious, though.

499
00:24:05,989 --> 00:24:09,226
These side dishes are
a unique culture of ours.

500
00:24:09,292 --> 00:24:11,728
-This is the true warmth of Korea.
-Exactly.

501
00:24:11,795 --> 00:24:14,364
In other words,
the owners are exhausted from cooking.

502
00:24:14,431 --> 00:24:17,100
WORN OUT FROM MAKING THE SIDE DISHES

503
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:21,271
Dujun, what is your
favorite side dish pairing?

504
00:24:22,239 --> 00:24:26,009
I just tried the <i>jangjorim</i>
with the quail eggs.

505
00:24:26,076 --> 00:24:29,112
-It's not salty at all.
-It's light.

506
00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:31,281
I'll place a piece of meat atop the rice.

507
00:24:32,315 --> 00:24:34,184
-Nice.
-What will go well with this?

508
00:24:35,151 --> 00:24:37,854
-Try it with the summer squash.
-Got it.

509
00:24:37,921 --> 00:24:39,322
-That's it.
-Add a piece.

510
00:24:39,389 --> 00:24:41,057
ADDING STIR-FRIED SUMMER SQUASH

511
00:24:41,124 --> 00:24:42,125
Let's try it.

512
00:24:42,192 --> 00:24:44,661
ENJOYING IT IN A SINGLE BITE

513
00:24:49,499 --> 00:24:51,501
The <i>jangjorim </i>is a bit salty,

514
00:24:51,568 --> 00:24:53,336
and the summer squash is sweet,

515
00:24:53,403 --> 00:24:55,105
so it's perfectly balanced.

516
00:24:55,171 --> 00:24:56,473
Let me see…

517
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,377
-I'll go for a dark pairing.
-What does that mean?

518
00:25:01,044 --> 00:25:02,479
-You mean the mushroom.
-Yes.

519
00:25:02,546 --> 00:25:03,947
BRAISED PINE MUSHROOM

520
00:25:04,014 --> 00:25:05,949
-And pickled chili.
-Okay.

521
00:25:06,016 --> 00:25:07,584
For a bit of acidity.

522
00:25:08,585 --> 00:25:11,087
I loved the aroma
of this pickled thorny <i>ogapi.</i>

523
00:25:11,154 --> 00:25:12,889
Add a bit of fragrance.

524
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:14,758
Together on top.

525
00:25:14,824 --> 00:25:16,793
-It's a vegetarian pairing.
-Exactly.

526
00:25:19,963 --> 00:25:23,533
EASILY DEVOURS IT IN ONE BITE

527
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,170
We're having enough food,
but why does my mouth water?

528
00:25:27,237 --> 00:25:28,238
Me too.

529
00:25:28,305 --> 00:25:30,607
MOUTHWATERING

530
00:25:31,207 --> 00:25:32,976
I ate a mouthful of greens.

531
00:25:33,043 --> 00:25:34,811
-I see.
-I could feel its fresh energy.

532
00:25:34,878 --> 00:25:37,147
Right, he ate mushrooms and <i>ogapi.</i>

533
00:25:37,214 --> 00:25:38,481
And chili.

534
00:25:38,548 --> 00:25:39,883
My pairing is simple.

535
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,751
I'll start with bulgogi.

536
00:25:42,586 --> 00:25:44,087
Place it on top of the rice.

537
00:25:44,154 --> 00:25:45,422
Meat as always?

538
00:25:45,488 --> 00:25:47,457
He chose the leaf mustard kimchi.

539
00:25:48,091 --> 00:25:50,360
Dang, this is the stuff.

540
00:25:51,361 --> 00:25:52,529
It's a classic pairing.

541
00:25:53,463 --> 00:25:56,132
MOUTHWATERING AGAIN

542
00:25:58,235 --> 00:26:00,837
If it's too bland, add a piece of chili.

543
00:26:00,904 --> 00:26:04,341
ADD SEASONED CRISP CHILI
IF SOMETHING FEELS LIKE IT'S MISSING

544
00:26:04,407 --> 00:26:06,176
WOW

545
00:26:06,443 --> 00:26:08,144
I'm not just full…

546
00:26:08,211 --> 00:26:10,013
-I'm happy.
-…I feel healthy.

547
00:26:11,047 --> 00:26:13,550
I haven't had a meal like this
in a long time.

548
00:26:14,384 --> 00:26:16,052
It's hard to come by.

549
00:26:17,287 --> 00:26:21,591
When you have a Korean course meal,
there are only a few side dishes you like.

550
00:26:21,658 --> 00:26:26,029
<i>There are so many good dishes here</i>
<i>that I don't know what to eat next.</i>

551
00:26:26,563 --> 00:26:29,432
WHEN YOU CAN'T CHOOSE WHAT TO EAT NEXT

552
00:26:30,033 --> 00:26:32,369
TRY THE BRAISED PINE MUSHROOM

553
00:26:32,435 --> 00:26:36,973
AND SEASONED CRISP CHILI

554
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,609
JUST DON'T STOP EATING

555
00:26:39,676 --> 00:26:40,677
Try this.

556
00:26:41,177 --> 00:26:43,113
-Wait…
-Did you try it?

557
00:26:43,179 --> 00:26:44,414
-Not yet.
-Try it.

558
00:26:44,481 --> 00:26:47,350
-It's not spicy.
-There's a reason he made it this way.

559
00:26:48,151 --> 00:26:50,887
-He blanched it briefly.
-It's full of flavor.

560
00:26:50,954 --> 00:26:54,291
Yes, the spiciness really comes through.

561
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:01,965
EVERYONE STARTS DEVOURING THE FOOD

562
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:09,372
EVERYONE STOPS TALKING AND DIGS IN

563
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,474
Wait a second.

564
00:27:12,142 --> 00:27:14,744
-We have never been this quiet.
-Definitely.

565
00:27:14,811 --> 00:27:18,815
We have to talk for the show,
but it's hard because the food is insane.

566
00:27:24,054 --> 00:27:27,023
WHAT WILL THEY FINISH THE MEAL WITH?

567
00:27:28,425 --> 00:27:30,560
The barley tea is nice.

568
00:27:32,062 --> 00:27:33,697
<i>There's no need for scorched rice.</i>

569
00:27:33,763 --> 00:27:36,666
CLEAN AND NUTTY BARLEY TEA

570
00:27:37,334 --> 00:27:40,537
DRINKING STRAIGHT FROM THE STONE POT

571
00:27:44,241 --> 00:27:47,677
I get super full when I eat too much rice,
but I feel great today.

572
00:27:47,744 --> 00:27:48,979
A FILLING BUT NICE MEAL

573
00:27:49,045 --> 00:27:52,182
Side dishes are so familiar to us

574
00:27:52,249 --> 00:27:55,752
that we often take them for granted.

575
00:27:55,819 --> 00:28:00,290
Personally, I really enjoyed trying
all of these new side dishes.

576
00:28:00,357 --> 00:28:02,058
I cleaned my plate.

577
00:28:03,126 --> 00:28:05,695
-I ate every last bite.
-Me too.

578
00:28:05,762 --> 00:28:07,664
I ate it all. I even ate all of the soup.

579
00:28:07,731 --> 00:28:09,599
<i>Wow, we devoured everything.</i>

580
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,768
<i>This is insane.</i>

581
00:28:11,835 --> 00:28:13,036
<i>It was an amazing meal.</i>

582
00:28:13,103 --> 00:28:15,105
-Thank you.
-Thank you for the food.

583
00:28:16,373 --> 00:28:17,741
Chef Song Haseulram,

584
00:28:17,807 --> 00:28:20,644
what does this go-to spot mean to you?

585
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:23,146
This place? Let me see…

586
00:28:23,213 --> 00:28:26,349
Like you said, blood sugar spikes
and low-sugar foods are hot topics.

587
00:28:26,416 --> 00:28:31,221
People are concerned about their health.
We're all trying to eat healthy.

588
00:28:31,288 --> 00:28:34,524
But rather than eating a lot of good food,

589
00:28:34,591 --> 00:28:37,861
it's more important to avoid bad food.

590
00:28:37,928 --> 00:28:43,199
Mothers usually want to provide us
with healthy food.

591
00:28:43,266 --> 00:28:44,467
Just like that,

592
00:28:44,534 --> 00:28:45,835
even when we can't go home,

593
00:28:45,902 --> 00:28:50,607
this go-to spot lets us enjoy
homemade food just like our mothers'.

594
00:28:50,674 --> 00:28:52,442
That's what this place means to me.

595
00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:55,579
-It's a substitute for your mom's meals.
-That's right.

596
00:28:55,645 --> 00:28:56,947
Thank you for the food.

597
00:28:57,013 --> 00:28:58,281
-Thank you.
-It was awesome.

598
00:28:58,348 --> 00:28:59,716
AHN JAE KOREAN RESTAURANT

599
00:28:59,783 --> 00:29:01,017
THANKS FOR THE MEAL

600
00:29:01,084 --> 00:29:02,752
<i>I want to bring my family here.</i>

601
00:29:05,655 --> 00:29:10,360
THE MAIN CHARACTERS OF A MEAL,
A NEW APPRECIATION FOR SIDE DISHES
