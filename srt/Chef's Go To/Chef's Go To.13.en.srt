THE THIRD, LIM TAEHOON

00:00:08,218 --> 00:00:09,719
<i>We're at Cheongdam Intersection.</i>

SCENES OF ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION

7
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:16,993
<i>This place feels fancy.</i>

8
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,863
I've been coming here
since I was a senior in high school.

9
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,965
It's been about 18 years.

10
00:00:22,032 --> 00:00:26,002
I became a head chef
for the first time in Cheongdam-dong.

11
00:00:26,069 --> 00:00:27,370
You have memories here.

12
00:00:27,437 --> 00:00:31,107
Who invited today's chef?

13
00:00:31,174 --> 00:00:34,110
I invited my favorite little brother.

14
00:00:34,177 --> 00:00:36,179
-Really?
-That's right.

15
00:00:36,246 --> 00:00:39,249
None of the invited chefs
were younger than you.

16
00:00:39,316 --> 00:00:43,920
Right, and you will be surprised
because he's a good-looking chef.

17
00:00:43,987 --> 00:00:45,522
He's unnecessarily handsome.

18
00:00:46,623 --> 00:00:48,258
<i>He's as tall as a model.</i>

19
00:00:48,325 --> 00:00:50,927
TALL LIKE A MODEL

20
00:00:51,595 --> 00:00:53,129
<i>And he's charming.</i>

21
00:00:53,196 --> 00:00:54,798
HE HAS AN ATTRACTIVE FACE

22
00:00:54,864 --> 00:00:58,068
I didn't know you had
a good-looking friend.

23
00:00:58,134 --> 00:01:01,171
Not all of my friends are like me.

24
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:02,906
I do have some handsome friends.

25
00:01:02,973 --> 00:01:07,878
You two can't hold a peaceful conversation
for longer than a minute.

26
00:01:07,944 --> 00:01:10,780
He's a very close friend,
but he's still at work.

27
00:01:11,815 --> 00:01:12,883
Isn't this a first?

28
00:01:12,949 --> 00:01:16,219
So, he told me we can start without him.

29
00:01:16,286 --> 00:01:18,455
-That's very Gen Z of him.
-Right.

30
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:20,223
Then let's get going, shall we?

31
00:01:20,991 --> 00:01:23,894
Dang, this place is so familiar.

32
00:01:24,694 --> 00:01:30,267
<i>Cheongdam-dong is home</i>
<i>to many entertainment agencies.</i>

33
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:33,870
I'm surprised that
my agency is just up ahead.

34
00:01:33,937 --> 00:01:35,272
<i>-Really?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

35
00:01:35,338 --> 00:01:37,207
DUJUN'S AGENCY IS RIGHT AHEAD?

36
00:01:37,274 --> 00:01:40,277
-That's the building for my agency.
-No way.

37
00:01:40,944 --> 00:01:44,447
<i>It used to be</i>
<i>the J*P Entertainment building.</i>

38
00:01:44,514 --> 00:01:47,651
-That's my company.
-It's nice.

39
00:01:47,717 --> 00:01:49,753
It's so close from here.

40
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,788
-Is this the place?
-It sure is.

41
00:01:51,855 --> 00:01:54,891
<i>It's right across from this building.</i>

42
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,893
<i>-It just takes ten seconds.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>

43
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,562
But I didn't know it was here.

44
00:01:58,628 --> 00:02:00,430
You rarely visit nearby restaurants.

45
00:02:00,497 --> 00:02:02,799
-Let's head inside. Namno, you go first.
-Sure.

46
00:02:06,202 --> 00:02:07,504
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

47
00:02:07,571 --> 00:02:08,838
OWNER OF SAEKGUKSI

48
00:02:08,905 --> 00:02:11,741
-Did you make a reservation?
-It's booked under Yoon Namno.

49
00:02:11,808 --> 00:02:14,144
There are no reservations under that name.

50
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:18,148
-Did we not make a reservation?
-It's booked under "Cooking Maniac."

51
00:02:18,882 --> 00:02:21,952
-That's me.
-Pleased to meet you.

52
00:02:22,552 --> 00:02:25,255
THE MOMENT YOU WALK
INTO THE COZY RESTAURANT

53
00:02:26,156 --> 00:02:30,227
SMALL AND CUTE DECORATIONS STAND OUT

54
00:02:30,594 --> 00:02:31,962
Saekguksi.

55
00:02:32,028 --> 00:02:33,997
-Saekguksi.
-I guess they sell noodles.

56
00:02:34,064 --> 00:02:36,766
The noodles must be tasty.
But it isn't on the menu.

57
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:37,901
NO NOODLES?

58
00:02:37,968 --> 00:02:40,704
-Why are there no noodles?
-It's explained here.

59
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,674
"Noodles were sold in 2009,
but are no longer offered."

60
00:02:44,741 --> 00:02:47,444
-They will be sold occasionally.
-I see.

61
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:51,548
I guess they really did sell noodles
since <i>guksi </i>is in their name.

62
00:02:51,615 --> 00:02:53,550
If she opened in 2009, it's been a while.

63
00:02:53,617 --> 00:02:57,120
I debuted in 2009,
so it opened around that time.

64
00:02:58,054 --> 00:02:59,155
Where is he?

65
00:02:59,222 --> 00:03:02,125
It's awkward being
in an unfamiliar restaurant.

66
00:03:02,692 --> 00:03:04,794
-Hold on.
-Is he here?

67
00:03:06,296 --> 00:03:07,330
He's here.

68
00:03:07,397 --> 00:03:08,565
Hello.

69
00:03:08,632 --> 00:03:10,066
TODAY'S CHEF FINALLY ARRIVED

70
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:11,234
Nice to meet you.

71
00:03:11,301 --> 00:03:13,103
He came straight from work.

72
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:16,106
I just got off. I couldn't even change.

73
00:03:16,172 --> 00:03:17,173
CHEF BAE GYEONGJUN

74
00:03:17,974 --> 00:03:21,711
CHEF ANH SUNGJAE'S APPRENTICE
WHO WORKED IN A 3-STAR RESTAURANT

75
00:03:22,512 --> 00:03:26,750
CURRENTLY THE HEAD CHEF
OF A KOREAN WOOD-FIRED RESTAURANT

76
00:03:28,351 --> 00:03:32,422
TODAY'S CHEF, BAE GYEONGJUN

77
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:34,524
Did you really come straight from work?

78
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:37,060
Yes, I was worried
about keeping everyone waiting.

79
00:03:37,127 --> 00:03:40,030
Right, he was probably very anxious.

80
00:03:40,096 --> 00:03:41,965
Today was a busy day, too.

81
00:03:42,032 --> 00:03:44,267
-He's still wearing his uniform.
-I am.

82
00:03:44,334 --> 00:03:46,870
-You're the first to wear that here.
-Really?

83
00:03:46,937 --> 00:03:48,004
That's why I smell.

84
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:51,741
Dang, you both look amazing.

85
00:03:51,808 --> 00:03:53,543
Stop it.

86
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,645
-They're handsome.
-Nice to meet you.

87
00:03:55,712 --> 00:03:57,013
What's up with this seating?

88
00:03:57,881 --> 00:04:01,351
Maybe this seating arrangement
was intentional.

89
00:04:01,418 --> 00:04:05,422
Excuse me, but what year were you born?

90
00:04:05,488 --> 00:04:06,523
I was born in 1994.

91
00:04:07,357 --> 00:04:09,559
You're the youngest chef
to be on this show.

92
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:12,329
Is that so? That's why Namno seems happy.

93
00:04:12,395 --> 00:04:13,863
He's never been this excited.

94
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,765
He's always teased by the older chefs,

95
00:04:15,832 --> 00:04:17,100
but now that I'm here…

96
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:20,604
Anyway, what should we order
in this restaurant?

97
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,541
The owner makes everything herself here,
so I thought it would take some time.

98
00:04:24,608 --> 00:04:26,843
-So, I called in advance.
-You're the best.

99
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,112
I already ordered the food.

100
00:04:29,179 --> 00:04:32,148
I thought this place would sell noodles,
but they don't.

101
00:04:32,215 --> 00:04:34,317
Actually, those places have good food.

102
00:04:34,384 --> 00:04:37,053
The last place sold pork belly,
but used sell pufferfish.

103
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,290
-You're right.
-Right, those are the good restaurants.

104
00:04:40,357 --> 00:04:42,826
-The fresh ingredients.
-I love seasonal food.

105
00:04:42,893 --> 00:04:44,494
THEY ARE EXCITED

106
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:47,130
-Here you go.
-Wow, the side dishes.

107
00:04:47,197 --> 00:04:48,632
SIDE DISHES ARE SERVED FIRST

108
00:04:48,698 --> 00:04:49,866
They're scrumptious.

109
00:04:50,867 --> 00:04:52,502
<i>-Is this baby octopus?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

110
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:54,404
STIR-FRIED BABY OCTOPUS

111
00:04:54,471 --> 00:04:57,474
<i>-This is seaweed sprout.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

112
00:04:58,275 --> 00:05:00,477
<i>-Is this </i>pulchi?
<i>-Yes.</i>

113
00:05:00,544 --> 00:05:03,813
-What's <i>pulchi?</i>
-It's baby cutlassfish.

114
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,150
How long have you been coming here?

115
00:05:07,217 --> 00:05:09,886
I first came here for a work dinner,
and the food was good.

116
00:05:09,953 --> 00:05:12,589
-It was light and delicious.
-I see.

117
00:05:12,656 --> 00:05:15,692
The side dishes alone just blew me away.

118
00:05:16,493 --> 00:05:17,928
I loved the <i>pulchi.</i>

119
00:05:17,994 --> 00:05:19,596
-I've never seen this.
-Let's try.

120
00:05:19,663 --> 00:05:21,031
Shall we start with this?

121
00:05:21,097 --> 00:05:24,000
WHAT DOES IT TASTE LIKE?

122
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:30,140
It's incredible.

123
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,009
My mouth waters the moment I taste it.

124
00:05:33,076 --> 00:05:34,411
As soon as you eat it.

125
00:05:34,477 --> 00:05:37,347
-It tastes like dried filefish.
-Exactly.

126
00:05:37,414 --> 00:05:39,382
It's still a bit chewy.

127
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:42,953
<i>-It's slightly salty.</i>
<i>-It tastes upscale.</i>

128
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:44,688
<i>-It looks fancy.</i>
<i>-It's nice.</i>

129
00:05:44,754 --> 00:05:46,856
I think I would come here just for this.

130
00:05:46,923 --> 00:05:48,425
I know, right?

131
00:05:48,491 --> 00:05:50,527
-What's this?
-It's baby octopus.

132
00:05:50,594 --> 00:05:53,263
-I think it's a special dish.
-How adorable.

133
00:05:53,897 --> 00:05:54,898
It looks amazing.

134
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:59,336
TAEHOON AND NAMNO TAKE A BITE

135
00:05:59,903 --> 00:06:00,904
WOW

136
00:06:02,739 --> 00:06:06,810
Chef Gyeongjun has a delicate palate
and is very picky.

137
00:06:07,677 --> 00:06:10,380
I understand why he likes this place.

138
00:06:10,447 --> 00:06:12,449
THIS GO-TO SPOT MEETS HIS STANDARDS

139
00:06:12,515 --> 00:06:16,086
Compared to other baby octopus dishes,
this isn't flavored too strongly.

140
00:06:16,152 --> 00:06:19,189
<i>-Usually, it's very salty right away.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

141
00:06:19,256 --> 00:06:22,425
-But it's perfectly seasoned.
-I agree.

142
00:06:22,492 --> 00:06:24,895
This also sparks your appetite.

143
00:06:24,961 --> 00:06:26,963
-Try the seaweed sprout.
-I love this.

144
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:30,934
It's a type of seaweed
that has a firm and chewy texture.

145
00:06:31,001 --> 00:06:33,803
<i>It's great if you dip it</i>
<i>in </i>chojang <i>like we do with kelp.</i>

146
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,106
The ingredients are unique.

147
00:06:36,172 --> 00:06:39,075
The side dishes instantly won my heart.

148
00:06:39,142 --> 00:06:41,378
<i>I can't believe all three</i>
<i>of them are yummy.</i>

149
00:06:41,444 --> 00:06:44,514
-I agree.
-The main dish must be unbelievable.

150
00:06:45,181 --> 00:06:46,683
You can look forward to it.

151
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,652
-He's arrogant today.
-He sure is.

152
00:06:48,718 --> 00:06:51,555
I'm just saying that
because I've got everything prepared.

153
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:56,326
THE HIGHLY-ANTICIPATED FIRST DISH IS HERE

154
00:06:56,393 --> 00:06:58,595
Wow, my heart is beating fast.

155
00:06:58,662 --> 00:07:00,664
CAN'T HELP BUT BE AMAZED

156
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,499
Here is the parboiled octopus.

157
00:07:02,566 --> 00:07:05,135
-This is a huge portion.
-I have to take a picture.

158
00:07:06,436 --> 00:07:12,008
NICELY SLICES THE HUGE OCTOPUS

159
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,446
CAREFULLY ARRANGES THEM ON A PLATE

160
00:07:18,515 --> 00:07:22,552
DELICIOUS PARBOILED OCTOPUS IS READY

161
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,688
WITH THREE TYPES OF SAUCE

162
00:07:24,754 --> 00:07:27,157
<i>CHOJANG, </i>WASABI SOY SAUCE,
AND SESAME OIL AND SALT

163
00:07:27,224 --> 00:07:29,526
Could we please get
the other sauce as well?

164
00:07:29,593 --> 00:07:30,727
-The one you like?
-Yes.

165
00:07:30,794 --> 00:07:32,395
-Sure.
-Is there another sauce?

166
00:07:32,462 --> 00:07:35,065
Is it a special sauce for regulars?

167
00:07:35,131 --> 00:07:38,902
It's usually only these sauces,
but she sometimes serves another one.

168
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:41,004
-Shall we dig in?
-Absolutely.

169
00:07:41,071 --> 00:07:42,472
What do I dip this in?

170
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,541
-Start with the sesame oil and salt.
-Okay.

171
00:07:45,575 --> 00:07:46,576
This is a must.

172
00:07:49,913 --> 00:07:50,914
DEEPLY MOVED ALREADY

173
00:07:50,981 --> 00:07:53,717
Rather than dipping seafood in <i>chojang,</i>

174
00:07:53,783 --> 00:07:55,819
I like to eat it with a sauce like this.

175
00:07:55,886 --> 00:07:57,721
Wow, I've got goosebumps.

176
00:07:57,787 --> 00:07:59,723
DUJUN HAS GOOSEBUMPS

177
00:08:01,424 --> 00:08:03,126
-I could chew on this all day.
-Yes.

178
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,328
It's not hard to chew at all.

179
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,766
CHEF GYEONGJUN ALSO TAKES A BITE

180
00:08:10,734 --> 00:08:12,002
She boiled it so well.

181
00:08:12,836 --> 00:08:14,237
-Isn't it perfect?
-Yes.

182
00:08:14,304 --> 00:08:16,840
-It's chewy and tender.
-I agree.

183
00:08:16,907 --> 00:08:19,910
I might be overreacting,
but it's like gummy bears.

184
00:08:19,976 --> 00:08:22,646
Gummy bears? That's a nice way to say it.

185
00:08:22,712 --> 00:08:24,915
Those are sweet, and this is as well.

186
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:26,550
<i>The chewiness doesn't bother me.</i>

187
00:08:26,616 --> 00:08:31,087
You probably know this,
but it's hard to boil octopus like this.

188
00:08:31,154 --> 00:08:34,124
-Of course.
-It's a very delicate ingredient.

189
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,026
It can get tough.

190
00:08:36,092 --> 00:08:39,563
If it isn't fully cooked,
it becomes hard to chew.

191
00:08:39,629 --> 00:08:41,831
<i>And if it's cooked for too long,</i>
<i>it's tough.</i>

192
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:45,502
<i>-This is boiled to perfection.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>

193
00:08:45,569 --> 00:08:47,404
I love the sesame oil and salt.

194
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,839
<i>The little bit of garlic is amazing.</i>

195
00:08:49,906 --> 00:08:51,508
<i>-The garlic in this sauce?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

196
00:08:51,575 --> 00:08:53,310
<i>I've never seen garlic in this.</i>

197
00:08:53,376 --> 00:08:55,245
EVEN THE SAUCE IS THOUGHTFULLY MADE

198
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,714
-More!
-Here's the sauce.

199
00:08:57,781 --> 00:08:58,782
Whoa, what's this?

200
00:08:58,848 --> 00:09:00,150
It's water parsley sauce.

201
00:09:00,217 --> 00:09:02,252
-Is this the sauce you asked for?
-Yes.

202
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:03,753
SAUCE FOR THE REGULARS

203
00:09:04,754 --> 00:09:07,224
My heart is racing. Thank you.

204
00:09:08,024 --> 00:09:09,025
SMELLS GOOD

205
00:09:10,994 --> 00:09:14,231
There are bits
of Cheongyang peppers in this, too.

206
00:09:14,297 --> 00:09:15,599
DIPPING IN THE SAUCE

207
00:09:15,665 --> 00:09:18,468
-Shall I have it with the water parsley?
-Yes.

208
00:09:18,535 --> 00:09:19,936
CAN'T HELP BUT LAUGH

209
00:09:20,003 --> 00:09:22,405
I'll have it with the octopus.
I'm excited.

210
00:09:22,472 --> 00:09:23,773
Hey, this is major.

211
00:09:24,441 --> 00:09:25,809
Is that so?

212
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,278
Water parsley is a game-changer.

213
00:09:29,012 --> 00:09:30,847
It's like I'm eating a salad.

214
00:09:32,883 --> 00:09:34,718
DUJUN IS ADDICTED TO THE FRAGRANT SAUCE

215
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:37,153
-It's aromatic.
-What's in this sauce?

216
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,755
IT SPARKS A CHEF'S CURIOSITY

217
00:09:38,822 --> 00:09:42,826
Onions, Cheongyang peppers,
and chili powder.

218
00:09:42,893 --> 00:09:45,095
<i>There's a lot of chili. And vinegar.</i>

219
00:09:45,161 --> 00:09:47,964
THE RICH FLAVOR COMES
FROM VARIOUS SEASONINGS AND INGREDIENTS

220
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,267
-Will you make it?
-You will sell it in Doryang.

221
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,735
-It's irresistible.
-Right?

222
00:09:51,801 --> 00:09:54,304
<i>I can't stop eating this with the octopus.</i>

223
00:09:54,371 --> 00:09:55,672
<i>This is insane.</i>

224
00:09:55,739 --> 00:09:57,574
Parboiled octopus is a common dish.

225
00:09:57,641 --> 00:10:00,877
But I get why Gyeongjun recommended this.
It's delicious.

226
00:10:00,944 --> 00:10:02,812
It's hard to make a common dish so well.

227
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,382
<i>This is the best</i>
<i>parboiled octopus I've had.</i>

228
00:10:05,448 --> 00:10:07,150
THE OCTOPUS IS GOOD WITH THE SAUCE

229
00:10:07,217 --> 00:10:08,552
Gyeongjun, I can't help it.

230
00:10:08,618 --> 00:10:11,054
-Let's order some drinks.
-Sure.

231
00:10:11,121 --> 00:10:14,424
-Order what you like.
-Okay, I'll order <i>tokkuri.</i>

232
00:10:15,892 --> 00:10:18,094
<i>-Tokkuri?</i>
-What's <i>tokkuri?</i>

233
00:10:18,161 --> 00:10:23,133
<i>Tokkuri </i>is a traditional
Japanese gourd-shaped liquor bottle.

234
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:25,101
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

235
00:10:25,168 --> 00:10:29,706
So, is it always called <i>tokkuri</i>
no matter what alcohol is inside?

236
00:10:29,773 --> 00:10:31,741
-Usually…
-Sake is usually inside it.

237
00:10:31,808 --> 00:10:33,209
That's right.

238
00:10:33,276 --> 00:10:35,111
Do you prefer sake cold or warm?

239
00:10:35,178 --> 00:10:36,746
-Do you like it warm?
-Yes.

240
00:10:36,813 --> 00:10:38,949
-Really?
-Yes.

241
00:10:39,015 --> 00:10:41,418
I don't think I've ever had warm alcohol.

242
00:10:41,484 --> 00:10:44,454
There's a reason
sake is served cold or hot.

243
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:47,991
It's because the taste and fragrance
of the alcohol are different.

244
00:10:48,058 --> 00:10:49,092
Exactly.

245
00:10:49,826 --> 00:10:51,494
-Could we please have <i>tokkuri?</i>
-Sure.

246
00:10:51,561 --> 00:10:54,931
-One hot and one cold, please.
-Got it.

247
00:10:54,998 --> 00:10:57,234
-Oh, it's pretty.
-Wow, that's the cold one.

248
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,368
This is the hot one.

249
00:10:59,569 --> 00:11:01,805
-Look at the steam.
-Thank you.

250
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,743
STARTING WITH A GLASS OF COLD SAKE

251
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,011
Thank you.

252
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:10,814
My heart is fluttering.

253
00:11:10,881 --> 00:11:12,816
Namno is feeling excited again.

254
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,218
-To our health.
-Cheers.

255
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:23,526
Oh, it's sweet.

256
00:11:26,062 --> 00:11:27,297
This is unreal.

257
00:11:27,931 --> 00:11:31,935
EATING IT WITH PARBOILED OCTOPUS
AND WATER PARSLEY SAUCE

258
00:11:32,736 --> 00:11:35,972
PERFECT PAIRING WITH THE SAKE

259
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:38,875
-It's overflowing.
-I'll do it since it's hot.

260
00:11:38,942 --> 00:11:40,377
TAEHOON POURS THE WARM SAKE

261
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,445
I'll try the warm one.

262
00:11:46,716 --> 00:11:47,784
Gulp it down.

263
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:51,454
-It's completely different.
-Really?

264
00:11:51,521 --> 00:11:55,292
The first sip of the cold sake

265
00:11:55,892 --> 00:11:59,296
<i>is fragrant at first,</i>
<i>but has a smooth finish.</i>

266
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,999
<i>The aroma of the warm one</i>
<i>fills your mouth.</i>

267
00:12:04,534 --> 00:12:06,870
It's a bit tough to swallow.

268
00:12:06,937 --> 00:12:08,505
-Is that so?
-Just a bit.

269
00:12:08,572 --> 00:12:11,074
It probably tastes stronger
since it's served hot.

270
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:12,309
It's totally different.

271
00:12:15,111 --> 00:12:19,249
CHEF GYEONGJUN TAKES A SIP
OF THE WARM SAKE

272
00:12:19,316 --> 00:12:20,984
What do you like more? Be honest.

273
00:12:21,051 --> 00:12:22,819
-What tastes better?
-The warm one.

274
00:12:22,886 --> 00:12:25,322
Really? How about you, Namno?

275
00:12:25,388 --> 00:12:26,990
-The cold one.
-I thought so.

276
00:12:27,057 --> 00:12:28,225
HE LIKES COLD DRINKS

277
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:31,595
The cold one goes well with sashimi.

278
00:12:31,661 --> 00:12:34,197
It goes perfectly with it.

279
00:12:34,264 --> 00:12:38,235
In winter, warm sake with fishcake
or <i>motsunabe </i>is the best.

280
00:12:39,402 --> 00:12:42,806
The day couldn't be better.

281
00:12:43,974 --> 00:12:45,342
This is nice.

282
00:12:45,408 --> 00:12:48,645
Taehoon, you're drinking a lot today.

283
00:12:48,712 --> 00:12:49,980
You can't help it here.

284
00:12:50,046 --> 00:12:51,781
Alcohol is a must.

285
00:12:51,848 --> 00:12:53,717
<i>You have to drink it with this octopus.</i>

286
00:12:53,783 --> 00:12:55,785
THE PARBOILED OCTOPUS MAKES YOU CRAVE SAKE

287
00:12:55,852 --> 00:12:56,920
Who ate all of this?

288
00:12:57,854 --> 00:12:59,055
Where did it go?

289
00:12:59,723 --> 00:13:00,724
It's all gone.

290
00:13:01,191 --> 00:13:02,826
-Shall we order some more?
-Sure.

291
00:13:02,893 --> 00:13:04,227
Let's keep them coming.

292
00:13:04,294 --> 00:13:05,629
-Ma'am.
-Yes.

293
00:13:05,695 --> 00:13:07,464
Could we please get some more octopus?

294
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,932
-Do you want more?
-Yes.

295
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:11,701
-Come to think of it, I'm a bit upset.
-Why?

296
00:13:11,768 --> 00:13:13,303
Why did you never bring me here?

297
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,172
Call me right away
when you find a place like this.

298
00:13:16,907 --> 00:13:19,509
TAEHOON QUIETLY GRABS A LEMON
THAT CAME WITH THE OCTOPUS

299
00:13:19,576 --> 00:13:22,479
Dang, he's squeezing the lemon.

300
00:13:23,613 --> 00:13:24,681
He's adding sugar.

301
00:13:24,748 --> 00:13:25,849
ALSO ADDS SUGAR

302
00:13:26,816 --> 00:13:28,218
I think he's making a sauce.

303
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:30,554
This would be a good pairing.

304
00:13:31,588 --> 00:13:32,589
Sesame oil and salt?

305
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:35,058
SESAME OIL AND SALT

306
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,159
And minced garlic.

307
00:13:36,226 --> 00:13:39,095
ADDS MINCED GARLIC AS WELL

308
00:13:39,162 --> 00:13:40,163
It's ready.

309
00:13:42,732 --> 00:13:46,903
DRIZZLE THE MIXED SAUCE
ON TOP OF THE PARBOILED OCTOPUS

310
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,805
Isn't this a cold salad?

311
00:13:48,872 --> 00:13:50,840
Yes, it's like cold jellyfish salad.

312
00:13:50,907 --> 00:13:51,975
<i>It's a new version.</i>

313
00:13:52,042 --> 00:13:53,877
TRANSFORMED INTO COLD OCTOPUS SALAD

314
00:13:53,944 --> 00:13:54,945
How did he…

315
00:13:56,179 --> 00:13:57,514
He whipped that up quickly.

316
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,751
It's excellent.

317
00:14:02,285 --> 00:14:03,954
Oh, this is great.

318
00:14:04,921 --> 00:14:06,790
The acidity bursts in my mouth.

319
00:14:06,856 --> 00:14:08,425
-Isn't it refreshing?
-Yes.

320
00:14:08,491 --> 00:14:10,660
The minced garlic is a must.

321
00:14:10,727 --> 00:14:13,263
It's like a dessert
if you add lemon and sugar.

322
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,865
You'd mix it in alcohol.
The garlic and salt are good.

323
00:14:15,932 --> 00:14:18,635
This sweet dish is a delicacy.

324
00:14:18,702 --> 00:14:21,838
CAN'T HELP BUT EXCLAIM
AT HOW ADDICTING IT IS

325
00:14:21,905 --> 00:14:24,741
It really is like a salad.
You made a salad dressing.

326
00:14:24,808 --> 00:14:27,410
There's octopus salad
in places like Italy.

327
00:14:27,477 --> 00:14:30,480
-I'm loving this.
-I'm excited for the next dish.

328
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:32,549
Wait, the next dish is ready.

329
00:14:32,616 --> 00:14:34,150
-Wow, what's this?
-It's here.

330
00:14:34,217 --> 00:14:35,785
-Pancake?
-I thought it was pizza.

331
00:14:35,852 --> 00:14:36,920
It's a potato pancake.

332
00:14:36,987 --> 00:14:38,455
-Finally.
-A potato pancake?

333
00:14:38,521 --> 00:14:41,024
Dang, it smells unbelievable.

334
00:14:41,091 --> 00:14:42,092
FASCINATING SMELL

335
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:44,461
It looks insane.

336
00:14:44,527 --> 00:14:45,562
IT CATCHES THE EYE

337
00:14:45,629 --> 00:14:47,397
-Let's have a bite.
-Let's try it.

338
00:14:48,031 --> 00:14:49,566
Do we just split it up?

339
00:14:51,234 --> 00:14:53,303
-Is there no sauce for this?
-The potatoes…

340
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,971
Just try it without the sauce.

341
00:14:55,038 --> 00:14:58,108
TAKING A BITE WITHOUT ANY SAUCE

342
00:14:59,042 --> 00:15:00,143
It's seasoned already.

343
00:15:01,745 --> 00:15:03,213
What's this?

344
00:15:04,214 --> 00:15:06,983
Isn't this taro? What is this?

345
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,786
<i>-Is it cheese?</i>
<i>-Did she mix something with the potatoes?</i>

346
00:15:09,853 --> 00:15:10,987
<i>I always order this.</i>

347
00:15:11,054 --> 00:15:12,822
-It's a mountain yam pancake.
-Really?

348
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:14,291
THE ANSWER IS YAM PANCAKE

349
00:15:14,357 --> 00:15:16,192
Wow, this is delicious.

350
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:18,361
You didn't know
it was a mountain yam, right?

351
00:15:18,428 --> 00:15:19,963
-Have you had this before?
-No.

352
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,132
-I've never had this before.
-It's fantastic.

353
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:25,669
-She blends it after it's ordered.
-Oh, really?

354
00:15:25,735 --> 00:15:28,038
The color changes
if you blend it in advance.

355
00:15:28,104 --> 00:15:30,440
-And water comes out.
-So you can't prep in advance.

356
00:15:31,207 --> 00:15:33,109
FOR THE BEST QUALITY

357
00:15:33,176 --> 00:15:35,512
SHE REMOVES THE SKIN
AND CHOPS IT AFTER IT'S ORDERED

358
00:15:38,815 --> 00:15:43,620
SHE BLENDS THE MOUNTAIN YAM
WITH POLLACK ROE

359
00:15:44,487 --> 00:15:48,358
SHE POURS THE FINELY-GROUND MOUNTAIN YAM
AND POLLACK ROE ON TOP OF THE OIL

360
00:15:49,025 --> 00:15:51,861
SHE ADDS SAVORY POLLACK ROE TOPPINGS

361
00:15:53,797 --> 00:15:58,602
HOW TO THOROUGHLY COOK IT:
CAREFULLY FLIP IT FOUR TIMES

362
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:01,204
MAKE HOLES HERE AND THERE

363
00:16:02,038 --> 00:16:04,874
COOK IT OVER LOW HEAT FOR A LONG TIME

364
00:16:05,675 --> 00:16:09,379
POLLACK ROE MOUNTAIN YAM PANCAKE
MADE WITH LOTS OF LOVE

365
00:16:12,315 --> 00:16:13,350
This is the stuff.

366
00:16:14,017 --> 00:16:16,586
-Yes, it's so good.
-Isn't it kind of creamy?

367
00:16:16,653 --> 00:16:18,288
You just gobble it up.

368
00:16:18,355 --> 00:16:20,724
-It tastes like cheese.
-Exactly.

369
00:16:21,725 --> 00:16:24,961
The texture just fills your mouth.

370
00:16:25,028 --> 00:16:27,831
It's like cotton candy.
It melts in your mouth.

371
00:16:28,598 --> 00:16:30,634
<i>-And it's like cheese.</i>
<i>-I agree.</i>

372
00:16:31,368 --> 00:16:34,638
I'm loving the pollack roe
inside the pancake.

373
00:16:34,704 --> 00:16:36,573
<i>It really enhances the umami.</i>

374
00:16:37,674 --> 00:16:42,512
Actually, I like dipping oily food
like pancakes in <i>chojang.</i>

375
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:45,115
-Dip it in <i>chojang.</i>
-Sure.

376
00:16:45,181 --> 00:16:46,750
I really like that combination.

377
00:16:47,617 --> 00:16:48,618
Ma'am.

378
00:16:48,685 --> 00:16:51,788
TAKING A BITE

379
00:16:51,855 --> 00:16:53,723
Oh, the <i>chojang </i>is incredible.

380
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,958
-Really?
-Isn't it good?

381
00:16:55,792 --> 00:16:56,893
-Really?
-Isn't it good?

382
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,595
DUJUN TRIES IT

383
00:17:00,764 --> 00:17:01,765
YUM

384
00:17:02,465 --> 00:17:04,134
I've never had it with <i>chojang.</i>

385
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,368
HIS FIRST TIME

386
00:17:05,435 --> 00:17:07,304
I never thought you could do that.

387
00:17:07,604 --> 00:17:09,539
<i>Chojang </i>pairs well with greasy food.

388
00:17:10,106 --> 00:17:11,942
They balance each other perfectly.

389
00:17:12,842 --> 00:17:15,045
<i>-It's scrumptious.</i>
<i>-Right?</i>

390
00:17:15,111 --> 00:17:17,814
FOUND A NEW PAIRING, PANCAKE AND <i>CHOJANG</i>

391
00:17:17,881 --> 00:17:19,883
We ate it all. Let's order one more.

392
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:20,951
Ma'am.

393
00:17:21,017 --> 00:17:22,852
DEVOURED IT IN SECONDS AGAIN

394
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:25,655
-Could we please get another pancake?
-Got it.

395
00:17:25,722 --> 00:17:27,924
We've never ordered refills of every dish.

396
00:17:27,991 --> 00:17:29,359
I can't get enough of this.

397
00:17:30,994 --> 00:17:34,664
NAMNO GETS TO TAKE THE LAST BITE,
AS ALWAYS

398
00:17:35,332 --> 00:17:37,534
I get why he was so confident.

399
00:17:37,601 --> 00:17:40,170
-It's fantastic.
-You can keep being so.

400
00:17:40,904 --> 00:17:45,775
Honestly, what was
your first impression of Chef Namno?

401
00:17:46,376 --> 00:17:47,444
You have to be honest.

402
00:17:47,978 --> 00:17:49,112
At first?

403
00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:52,515
But I had heard things
about him before we met.

404
00:17:52,582 --> 00:17:53,950
What did you hear?

405
00:17:54,017 --> 00:17:55,118
"There's a weird guy."

406
00:17:56,152 --> 00:17:57,621
-"He's a funny guy."
-Yup.

407
00:17:59,322 --> 00:18:02,492
-Just like his nickname, there's a maniac.
-I heard that, too.

408
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,894
I kept hearing this stuff.

409
00:18:04,527 --> 00:18:07,063
How was he when you actually met him?

410
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,933
At that time, everyone said
he looked intimidating.

411
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,635
But I didn't think so.

412
00:18:11,701 --> 00:18:14,337
He seemed like a fun guy.
I wanted to be his friend.

413
00:18:14,404 --> 00:18:15,572
Oh, really?

414
00:18:15,639 --> 00:18:17,073
You can't lie on this show.

415
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,508
It's the truth.

416
00:18:18,575 --> 00:18:21,878
But he changed a little after being on TV.

417
00:18:21,945 --> 00:18:23,280
-He changed, right?
-Taehoon?

418
00:18:23,346 --> 00:18:24,981
-He's not the same.
-Me? Why?

419
00:18:25,048 --> 00:18:28,084
He puts his hands in his pockets
more than he used to.

420
00:18:28,151 --> 00:18:30,620
-He acts cocky.
-I sweat a lot.

421
00:18:31,421 --> 00:18:34,591
My hands get sweaty.
That's why I stick them in my pockets.

422
00:18:34,658 --> 00:18:36,426
-It's a misunderstanding.
-I'm joking.

423
00:18:36,493 --> 00:18:37,861
No, you're not.

424
00:18:38,762 --> 00:18:41,264
When we drink in places like this,

425
00:18:41,331 --> 00:18:43,466
he tells me to order anything I want.

426
00:18:43,533 --> 00:18:48,471
-I've always wanted to do that.
-I know that feeling.

427
00:18:48,538 --> 00:18:52,676
He was like, "I'll have all of this."
I thought he was out of his mind.

428
00:18:53,443 --> 00:18:55,412
He's a good guy who buys me everything.

429
00:18:57,847 --> 00:19:00,150
-Finally.
-It's here.

430
00:19:00,217 --> 00:19:01,451
TODAY'S LAST DISH IS HERE

431
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:03,920
What is this?

432
00:19:05,288 --> 00:19:07,424
WRAPPING IT UP WITH A WARM DISH

433
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:14,397
BRAISED POMFRET

434
00:19:14,464 --> 00:19:16,066
This is braised pomfret.

435
00:19:16,132 --> 00:19:17,400
Dang, it smells insane.

436
00:19:17,901 --> 00:19:21,338
I always order this at the end
after drinking alcohol.

437
00:19:21,404 --> 00:19:22,405
-This dish?
-Yes.

438
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,941
<i>I start with the parboiled octopus.</i>

439
00:19:25,775 --> 00:19:27,811
<i>-And then eat the pancake.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

440
00:19:28,812 --> 00:19:30,380
<i>And then this is the main dish.</i>

441
00:19:30,447 --> 00:19:31,715
<i>Gosh, this looks amazing.</i>

442
00:19:32,315 --> 00:19:36,019
The seasoning doesn't seem too heavy.

443
00:19:36,086 --> 00:19:39,322
<i>-It looks less spicy than I expected.</i>
<i>-Yes, it's mild.</i>

444
00:19:39,389 --> 00:19:40,724
<i>It's not strong.</i>

445
00:19:41,691 --> 00:19:43,593
But why is the pomfret so big?

446
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,595
SCOOPS A LARGE PIECE OF POMFRET

447
00:19:46,229 --> 00:19:47,230
Thank you.

448
00:19:47,297 --> 00:19:50,033
Pomfret is amazing during this season.

449
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,368
-In the summer.
-Exactly.

450
00:19:52,736 --> 00:19:56,172
Pomfret smells really fishy
if it's not cooked properly.

451
00:19:56,773 --> 00:19:59,576
-But it smells super clean. It's aromatic.
-I agree.

452
00:19:59,643 --> 00:20:00,810
A FRESH, LINGERING SCENT

453
00:20:00,877 --> 00:20:02,712
Dang, this is…

454
00:20:03,547 --> 00:20:05,715
Gosh, I bet it tastes unbelievable.

455
00:20:07,817 --> 00:20:09,819
TRYING THE POMFRET FIRST

456
00:20:11,454 --> 00:20:12,589
How is it?

457
00:20:13,189 --> 00:20:15,825
Wow, it's extremely fresh.

458
00:20:16,393 --> 00:20:17,394
Really?

459
00:20:19,996 --> 00:20:22,399
IT SUITS DUJUN'S TASTE PERFECTLY

460
00:20:22,465 --> 00:20:25,802
The flesh separates easily
along the grain.

461
00:20:25,869 --> 00:20:29,039
<i>-You can tell it's fresh.</i>
<i>-It's delicious and light.</i>

462
00:20:29,105 --> 00:20:32,342
It's perfectly seasoned
and not too strong.

463
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,182
THIS IS THE STUFF

464
00:20:39,883 --> 00:20:42,319
NAMNO EATS IT OFF THE PLATE

465
00:20:45,188 --> 00:20:46,923
There's a certain way to eat this.

466
00:20:47,424 --> 00:20:50,160
-You have to eat it with radish.
-Exactly.

467
00:20:50,227 --> 00:20:51,528
It's a must.

468
00:20:52,262 --> 00:20:54,998
TAKING A PIECE OF POMFRET WITH RADISH

469
00:20:55,065 --> 00:20:56,066
Oh, no.

470
00:20:58,935 --> 00:20:59,936
The radish is amazing.

471
00:21:00,003 --> 00:21:01,171
I KNEW IT

472
00:21:02,872 --> 00:21:05,909
ONLY TRYING THE RADISH THIS TIME

473
00:21:05,976 --> 00:21:09,279
-I love the texture of this.
-It's the perfect pairing.

474
00:21:09,346 --> 00:21:13,283
-The radish isn't overcooked.
-I agree.

475
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,652
<i>And it isn't even undercooked.</i>
<i>It's just right.</i>

476
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,622
<i>It's the perfect wrap.</i>

477
00:21:18,688 --> 00:21:20,523
<i>Wrap it like you're making </i>gimbap.

478
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,858
A PERFECT FINISHING TOUCH

479
00:21:22,225 --> 00:21:23,526
I'm obsessed with this.

480
00:21:24,227 --> 00:21:26,897
Potato and radish
in braised fish is the best.

481
00:21:26,963 --> 00:21:30,901
The fish flavor seeps into the radish,
which makes it delicious.

482
00:21:34,037 --> 00:21:35,639
-I get why it's thinly sliced.
-Why?

483
00:21:35,705 --> 00:21:38,408
She cooks it once it's ordered.

484
00:21:38,475 --> 00:21:40,343
<i>That's why she made thin slices.</i>

485
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,412
<i>To make it cook quickly.</i>

486
00:21:42,479 --> 00:21:45,415
Usually, it's served in thick slices
in braised dishes.

487
00:21:45,482 --> 00:21:47,584
-So, you scoop it up like pudding.
-Right.

488
00:21:47,651 --> 00:21:50,887
I like that it's nicely cooked.

489
00:21:50,954 --> 00:21:55,325
If it's just cooked over high heat,
it becomes mashed and broken up.

490
00:21:55,392 --> 00:21:57,594
<i>But this has the right amount of texture.</i>

491
00:21:57,661 --> 00:21:59,729
<i>The texture comes through.</i>

492
00:21:59,796 --> 00:22:02,432
<i>When it's cooked this much,</i>

493
00:22:02,499 --> 00:22:05,902
-the seasoning doesn't seep in very well.
-Right.

494
00:22:05,969 --> 00:22:07,904
-It's well seasoned.
-How is this possible?

495
00:22:07,971 --> 00:22:13,043
I asked the owner what her method was
for making it like this.

496
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:17,314
<i>She boils it down over low heat.</i>

497
00:22:17,948 --> 00:22:20,784
<i>It simmers for about 20 minutes.</i>

498
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:23,520
SHE LETS IT SIMMER FOR 20 MINUTES
OVER LOW HEAT

499
00:22:24,421 --> 00:22:27,457
Sometimes, you learn something
in order to sell it.

500
00:22:27,524 --> 00:22:30,427
And sometimes, you just want
to learn this to make it at home.

501
00:22:30,493 --> 00:22:32,229
-I'm craving rice.
-Me too.

502
00:22:32,762 --> 00:22:34,231
Do they have rice?

503
00:22:34,297 --> 00:22:38,835
It's not on the menu,
but she brings me instant rice sometimes.

504
00:22:38,902 --> 00:22:40,370
-Really?
-Yes.

505
00:22:40,437 --> 00:22:41,805
-Ma'am.
-Yes.

506
00:22:41,871 --> 00:22:44,708
Could we please have two bowls of rice?

507
00:22:44,774 --> 00:22:47,444
Do you serve instant rice,
even if it's not on the menu?

508
00:22:47,811 --> 00:22:50,780
-The food is incredible.
-Thank you.

509
00:22:54,784 --> 00:22:56,486
<i>She gave us kimchi with the rice.</i>

510
00:22:56,553 --> 00:22:58,121
<i>She said it's homemade.</i>

511
00:22:58,722 --> 00:22:59,723
What kimchi is this?

512
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:01,625
NAMNO SLURPS IT FIRST

513
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:04,928
-What is it?
-Come on, try it.

514
00:23:04,995 --> 00:23:06,696
-It's young radish kimchi.
-Got it.

515
00:23:06,763 --> 00:23:09,232
THE YOUNG RADISH KIMCHI GOT NAMNO EXCITED

516
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:10,433
Wow, it's refreshing.

517
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:12,769
The other one is cabbage kimchi.

518
00:23:12,836 --> 00:23:14,804
Really? Oh, it sure is cabbage.

519
00:23:16,306 --> 00:23:19,376
IT'S HARD TO COME BY CABBAGE KIMCHI

520
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,078
-I've never had this.
-Me neither.

521
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,349
The spiciness kicks in immediately.

522
00:23:26,783 --> 00:23:29,920
WIDE-EYED

523
00:23:29,986 --> 00:23:32,255
It looks like ordinary kimchi.

524
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:35,926
But how do I put this?
It just melts in my mouth.

525
00:23:35,992 --> 00:23:39,296
Napa cabbage is also sweet,
but regular cabbage is sweeter.

526
00:23:39,362 --> 00:23:40,497
Exactly.

527
00:23:40,564 --> 00:23:44,467
It's like pickled cabbage.
What is it called?

528
00:23:44,534 --> 00:23:47,070
-Sauerkraut.
-Yes, that's it.

529
00:23:47,137 --> 00:23:49,506
-You usually eat sauerkraut with sausages.
-Right.

530
00:23:49,573 --> 00:23:50,740
GERMAN PICKLED CABBAGE

531
00:23:50,807 --> 00:23:54,778
I was craving pickled vegetables
since this is a bit greasy.

532
00:23:55,378 --> 00:23:58,348
It's perfect for balancing out
the greasiness.

533
00:23:58,415 --> 00:24:02,419
The sourness and sweetness come through
because it's fermented.

534
00:24:02,485 --> 00:24:06,122
<i>-It's fantastic.</i>
<i>-Fermentation brings out the sweetness.</i>

535
00:24:06,189 --> 00:24:08,091
<i>Even the kimchi is delicious here.</i>

536
00:24:09,726 --> 00:24:12,295
Did you try it? Isn't it awesome?

537
00:24:12,829 --> 00:24:14,698
I love the broth with fish meat.

538
00:24:14,764 --> 00:24:16,566
You have to eat the fish pieces.

539
00:24:17,467 --> 00:24:19,469
-Shall I try the fish pieces?
-Of course.

540
00:24:25,842 --> 00:24:27,777
TOUCHED RIGHT AWAY BY THE TASTE

541
00:24:27,844 --> 00:24:29,813
I love the broth with fish flesh.

542
00:24:31,615 --> 00:24:34,084
CHEF GYEONGJUN ENJOYS A BIG SPOONFUL

543
00:24:37,721 --> 00:24:39,189
I'm in love with this pancake.

544
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,661
SURPRISED

545
00:24:44,728 --> 00:24:48,265
I dunked the rice in the broth
and was left breathless from the flavor

546
00:24:48,899 --> 00:24:50,834
<i>-Was it that good?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

547
00:24:50,901 --> 00:24:53,136
<i>It's dangerous.</i>
<i>You won't stop eating rice.</i>

548
00:24:53,203 --> 00:24:54,204
<i>Wow, this is good.</i>

549
00:24:55,772 --> 00:24:58,441
We have tried various dishes so far.

550
00:24:58,508 --> 00:25:01,444
-Gyeongjun's course is a huge success.
-Definitely.

551
00:25:02,045 --> 00:25:04,047
DEVOURED IN NO TIME

552
00:25:04,114 --> 00:25:06,082
I should come here again tomorrow.

553
00:25:06,149 --> 00:25:08,051
You're serious about that.

554
00:25:08,118 --> 00:25:11,755
A lot of chefs must already know
about this place.

555
00:25:11,821 --> 00:25:13,089
But I've never heard of it.

556
00:25:13,156 --> 00:25:17,160
They haven't been here before,
but they love it when they come here.

557
00:25:17,227 --> 00:25:19,496
I think they'll fall in love
with this place.

558
00:25:19,563 --> 00:25:20,964
THIS SPOT CAPTIVATED THE CHEFS

559
00:25:21,731 --> 00:25:22,999
WHAT DOES THIS PLACE MEAN?

560
00:25:23,066 --> 00:25:27,037
This place comes to my mind after work.

561
00:25:27,103 --> 00:25:29,039
It's a spot I can visit anytime.

562
00:25:29,105 --> 00:25:32,442
It's not a fancy place
or anything like that.

563
00:25:32,509 --> 00:25:35,245
It's like going over to a friend's house.

564
00:25:35,312 --> 00:25:36,947
-You're treated well.
-Exactly.

565
00:25:37,013 --> 00:25:39,049
It's like food your friend's mom made.

566
00:25:39,115 --> 00:25:41,918
-That's it.
-A friend's mom who's an amazing cook.

567
00:25:41,985 --> 00:25:45,055
She's your friend's mom,
but also a former chef.

568
00:25:45,121 --> 00:25:48,358
Gyeongjun rushed here
to introduce us to his go-to spot.

569
00:25:48,425 --> 00:25:51,127
He couldn't even change
his clothes after work.

570
00:25:51,194 --> 00:25:53,430
-Thank you so much for this.
-Thank you.

571
00:25:53,496 --> 00:25:55,498
I'm grateful you enjoyed the food.

572
00:25:55,565 --> 00:25:57,033
Aren't you happy it's nearby?

573
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,002
My agency is right around the corner.

574
00:25:59,069 --> 00:26:01,438
-Really?
-It's just 10 meters down the street.

575
00:26:01,504 --> 00:26:04,241
I can come here when there's a table.

576
00:26:04,307 --> 00:26:05,375
-This is nice.
-Right.

577
00:26:05,442 --> 00:26:07,677
We had an amazing meal today,
thanks to you.

578
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,379
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

579
00:26:09,446 --> 00:26:12,749
THANK YOU FOR THE MEAL, AS ALWAYS

580
00:26:16,286 --> 00:26:20,390
A SMALL DETAIL MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE,
A TABLE FULL OF BAR SNACKS MADE WITH CARE
