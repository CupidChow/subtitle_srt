00:00:01,535 --> 00:00:03,737
JEONNONG-DONG, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL

2
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:06,874
THIS CONTAINS SCENES
OF ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION

3
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:10,277
THE STREET IS LINED WITH OLD SHOPS

4
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:12,446
TIME SEEMS TO SLOW DOWN

5
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,748
AND LINGER HERE

6
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:19,920
WHICH FOODIE BROTHERS CAME
TO JEONNONG-DONG TODAY?

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,689
THE FOURTH, YOON DUJUN
THE THIRD, LIM TAEHOON

8
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,358
THE YOUNGEST, YOON NAMNO

9
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,827
What neighborhood are we in?

10
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:28,862
It seems like we're on military leave

11
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,464
-in a small town.
-Exactly.

12
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,232
-It's kind of like Gapyeong.
-Right.

13
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,234
The bathhouse sign looks old, too.

14
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:37,204
Hongjitang, inns.

15
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:39,873
I've never seen a doghouse outside

16
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,609
-like this in Seoul.
-Right.

17
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:43,944
Seriously.

18
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:46,713
-It's well-built.
-Yes, it looks nice.

19
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,249
-It's a stray cat's house.
-Really?

20
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:50,851
I see.

21
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:55,322
-Hello.
-Ma'am, have you always lived here?

22
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,325
-I've lived here for 60 years.
-That long?

23
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,163
-Have you ever seen any of us on TV?
-This guy.

24
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,898
Wait, she picked Namno.

25
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:06,733
-I think he does <i>mukbang.</i>
<i>-Mukbang?</i>

26
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,835
I've seen him often.

27
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,003
My grandson watches it
as soon as he wakes up.

28
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,305
I knew it.

29
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,006
-But he's a chef, ma'am.
-Right.

30
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,074
They're both chefs.

31
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:17,311
Think of him as a chef who loves food.

32
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:20,080
-I've seen you eat lots of steamed rice.
-That's hilarious.

33
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,217
-You're right.
-Are there a lot

34
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:26,086
of good restaurants in this neighborhood?

35
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:28,322
The barley rice here is good.

36
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:30,557
-It's 5,000 won. It's so good.
-It sure is.

37
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,593
You can't find food for 5,000 won now.

38
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:35,128
-And the <i>buchimgae </i>is only 500 won.
-Really?

39
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:36,196
-That's right.
-Yes.

40
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,265
The Jeonnong Market bean pancake
is 500 won.

41
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:40,033
-It's on the internet.
-Right.

42
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,535
-It's amazing.
-It's tasty.

43
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,070
Everything there is good.

44
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:46,206
-Anyway, we'll go try some good food here.
-Good luck.

45
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,608
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

46
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:48,809
-Thank you.
-Take care.

47
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:49,877
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

48
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:52,145
A FUN MEET-UP WITH JEONNONG-DONG RESIDENTS

49
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:59,119
Have any of you been here before?
I've actually never heard of this place.

50
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:03,457
-How about you?
-I don't think I've ever come here.

51
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:04,892
I'm not familiar, either.

52
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,961
So, I invited a good restaurant guide
who lives here.

53
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:10,230
We should be cautious
calling someone the best.

54
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:13,100
-Nobody beats this chef in his field.
-What type of cuisine?

55
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,603
Yes, it's called teppanyaki.
I think this chef is the best in that.

56
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,939
A CHEF WHOM NAMNO DEEMS BEST IN TEPPANYAKI

57
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:20,941
We should meet this chef.

58
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,677
Why isn't he coming?
I told him not to be late.

59
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:26,079
IN AN ALLEY IN JEONNONG-DONG

60
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:29,183
CARRYING A STRANGE BRIEFCASE

61
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,317
-Wait.
-Look.

62
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:32,486
-Wait a second.
-Hello.

63
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:34,788
-What's with the 007 briefcase?
-What's that?

64
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:36,023
-Hello.
-Hi.

65
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,891
It feels like he's acting.

66
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,726
You're so good-looking.

67
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:40,827
MOVE ASIDE

68
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,063
-I'm such a fan.
-Nice to meet you.

69
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,300
I'm Cooking Maniac's friend,
Lee Gyeongjin.

70
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:50,003
HE STUDIED ABROAD IN JAPAN,
HOME OF TEPPANYAKI

71
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:53,073
HE WORKED IN A 3-STAR M*CHELIN RESTAURANT

72
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:57,444
HE'S CURRENTLY THE HEAD CHEF
AT KOREA'S TOP LUXURY HOTEL

73
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:01,515
HE BRINGS INGREDIENTS TO LIFE
ON THE GRIDDLE

74
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:04,651
THE MAESTRO OF TEPPANYAKI

75
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:08,322
TODAY'S CHEF, LEE GYEONGJIN,
THE KING OF TEPPANYAKI

76
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,023
-Chef Lee Gyeongjin.
-Right.

77
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,392
Actually, I've seen you
on shows with Namno.

78
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,294
People might recognize you, too.

79
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,663
I bring him to shoots
because I care about him.

80
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,699
-But this will be the last time.
-I see.

81
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:22,169
I prepared a lot for today,
so I even brought a briefcase.

82
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:25,105
Has anyone recognized you
after going on shows with Namno?

83
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:27,341
Not as much as Namno…

84
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,409
-But?
-…but I've been recognized twice

85
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,945
-on the subway.
-You made an impression, then.

86
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,180
Isn't it funny he's happy

87
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:36,350
-to be recognized twice?
-But it might be my imagination.

88
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,885
Right, that happens a lot.

89
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:41,154
Please introduce Jeonnong-dong.
We're not familiar with this area.

90
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,091
It may be obvious, but this area
looks like it's frozen in time.

91
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,158
-I agree.
-Yes.

92
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:49,296
The buildings and signs haven't changed
in many years.

93
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:51,598
-How long have you lived here?
-Just two years.

94
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:52,699
-Really?
-Yes.

95
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,469
-I thought you'd been here 10 years.
-Did you grow up here?

96
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:57,638
It's been 3 years
since I came back to Korea.

97
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,373
It's two-thirds of my time here,

98
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,241
-so that's a long time.
-Got it.

99
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,811
WHAT'S HIS GO-TO PLACE HERE?

100
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:06,647
<i>As a local here,</i>

101
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,949
-I'll introduce an old-school eatery.
-Let's go.

102
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:11,418
-I'll be your guide.
-Off we go.

103
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:15,923
<i>-The buildings are all low here.</i>
<i>-You're right.</i>

104
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,058
All of the buildings are old.

105
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,159
RETRO VIBES

106
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:20,894
It doesn't feel like Seoul.

107
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:23,564
-Look at the vending machine.
-It's so old.

108
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,631
It sure is.

109
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,867
I used this ages ago.

110
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,136
I've tried using
the creamer option on this.

111
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:30,671
-There's milk.
-Right.

112
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,506
-Oh, the creamer milk.
-Exactly.

113
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:34,308
-Right.
-That was unbelievable.

114
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,576
-Creamer milk.
-Right.

115
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,178
-They used to have one in every store.
-Right.

116
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:39,813
This place brings back memories.

117
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:41,882
STROLLING THROUGH THE ALLEY

118
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,051
We're walking through the alley.

119
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:46,887
<i>It gives old-school vibes.</i>

120
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,722
GETTING NOSTALGIC

121
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:49,790
I love the vibes.

122
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:52,426
I loved the vibe when I first came here.

123
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:53,660
This is cool.

124
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,063
Here we are.

125
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,431
Look at that.

126
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,399
-Now you'll start to feel it.
-My gosh.

127
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:03,070
-It's like we're stuck in time.
-This is great.

128
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,372
JEONNONG-DONG STREET
WITH OLD-SCHOOL EATERIES

129
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,508
OLD-SCHOOL <i>GUKBAP, </i>BEEF INTESTINE STEW

130
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:10,244
COZY OLD-SCHOOL EATERIES FILL THE STREETS

131
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,779
COLD NOODLES
COLD SOYBEAN NOODLE SOUP

132
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:14,348
Where are we eating?

133
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,283
There are so many restaurants.

134
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,585
We're going to Eunha Gopchang.

135
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:19,720
-Eunha Gopchang?
-Yes.

136
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,822
CHEF'S GO-TO

137
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:23,690
CHEF LEE GYEONGJIN'S GO-TO PLACE

138
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:24,858
EUNHA'S PLACE

139
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:28,328
<i>It's been here forever. They expanded</i>
<i>by taking over nearby shops.</i>

140
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,797
<i>The restaurant must've gotten bigger.</i>

141
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:31,865
GREW OVER THE YEARS

142
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,335
ENTERING WITH EXCITEMENT

143
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,271
Hello.

144
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,572
-Hello.
-Hi.

145
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,208
-Welcome.
-It's packed in here.

146
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:44,311
-Come on in.
-Welcome. Come on in.

147
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:45,979
-She's the owner.
-Hello, ma'am.

148
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:48,215
-She's the founding auntie.
-I see.

149
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:50,250
-Thanks.
-She's second in command.

150
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,921
-Is she your daughter?
-I'm her daughter-in-law.

151
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:58,125
46 YEARS AGO IN JEONNONG-DONG

152
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,094
THE MOTHER-IN-LAW STARTED THE RESTAURANT

153
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:04,598
AND THE DAUGHTER-IN-LAW
EXPANDED THE FAMILY BUSINESS

154
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:08,101
THE REASON IT'S BUSTLING WITH PEOPLE
EVEN DURING THE DAY ON WEEKDAYS

155
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:12,606
IS THE IRRESISTIBLE AND RICH FLAVORS
OF ITS FOOD

156
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:15,642
DEVOURING THE FOOD, BITE AFTER BITE

157
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,712
FILLS YOUR HEART WITH JOY

158
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,715
Look at the newspapers.

159
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:23,550
-Do you feel the vibe?
-Yes.

160
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:24,685
Look.

161
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:25,853
Look behind you.

162
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:28,288
The date reads 2014.

163
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:29,690
-Is it the year 2014?
-Yes.

164
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:30,991
THE DATE SAYS 2014

165
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:37,698
The store was renovated using newspapers
dated the same day in 2014.

166
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,934
THE WALL OF NEWSPAPERS REFLECTS
A DECADE OF HISTORY

167
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:45,272
FEELING THE NOSTALGIC VIBES OF THE PAST

169
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,642
WE WERE HERE

170
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:50,644
JUST KEEP GOING
SO DELICIOUS

171
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:54,214
-The cross-shaped fluorescent lights.
-Look at the hangers.

172
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,149
VINTAGE ITEMS THAT ADD A NOSTALGIC VIBE

173
00:06:57,885 --> 00:07:00,587
-The nostalgic vibe feels amazing.
-Yes, I'm loving it.

174
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:04,791
The funny thing is
that there's no cash register here.

175
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:06,426
-No.
-She handwrites them.

176
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:09,663
-Isn't that a very old-fashioned way?
-They still use that method.

177
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,598
TAKING ORDERS BY WRITING THEM DOWN

178
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,469
There's only one item on the menu,
hot pot.

179
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:16,737
You just choose the size.

180
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:17,804
PORK <i>GOPCHANG </i>HOT POT

181
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,173
WHAT WILL THE FOODIES HAVE?

182
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,141
THE LARGE ONE

183
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:25,245
When you look up
the top three <i>gopchang </i>spots in Seoul,

184
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:28,115
three places come up,
and two of them sell beef <i>gopchang.</i>

185
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:30,484
-This is the only one with pork <i>gopchang.</i>
-Pork<i>.</i>

186
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:33,020
Oh, really? Is this spot on the list?

187
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:34,588
Look up the top 3 <i>gopchang </i>spots…

188
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,024
-Is this the only spot with pork <i>gopchang?</i>
-Yes.

189
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,761
I've had a lot of beef <i>gopchang </i>hot pot.

190
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,663
I really love it.

191
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,832
But I've never had pork <i>gopchang </i>hot pot.

192
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,334
-Really?
-Yes.

193
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:50,137
Do people not eat it that much?

194
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:52,206
-Not everyone likes it.
-Okay.

195
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:54,074
Why is that?

196
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,777
-It smells a bit…
-Is it from the pork innards?

197
00:07:56,844 --> 00:07:59,413
It's quite gamey.
I won't say that it smells.

198
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,514
-It's the aroma.
-Yes.

199
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:03,817
The meaty aroma is
a matter of personal preference.

200
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:07,321
HALF-EXCITED, HALF-WORRIED

201
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:09,456
COOKING BEGINS AMIDST TAEHOON'S WORRIES

202
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:11,725
FRESHLY DELIVERED PORK <i>GOPCHANG</i>

203
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:15,696
ADDING THE SPECIAL SAUCE
AND VARIOUS SEASONINGS

204
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,170
AFTER BOILING IT OVER HIGH HEAT

205
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:28,442
THEIR MAIN DISH IS GETTING COOKED

206
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:34,448
PORK <i>GOPCHANG </i>HOT POT IS READY

207
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:38,652
FINALLY GETTING UP CLOSE WITH TODAY'S DISH

208
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:42,656
PORK <i>GOPCHANG </i>HOT POT

209
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:49,796
IT'S BEEN PRE-BOILED,
BUT CAN BE ENJOYED AS IT SIMMERS

210
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,869
TIME TO GET LOST IN PORK <i>GOPCHANG </i>HOT POT

211
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,906
-It's like <i>gopchang </i>stew.
-Yes, it's slightly different.

212
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,908
It only has a little broth.

213
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,311
So, you start with the broth
as it simmers.

214
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,479
It looks good.

215
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,347
SUPER EXCITED

216
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:11,485
DUJUN IS EXCITED BY THE SMELL
OF PORK <i>GOPCHANG </i>HOT POT

217
00:09:12,186 --> 00:09:15,055
TAEHOON TRIES SNIFFING GENTLY

218
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:19,426
SIPS WATER FOR NO REASON

219
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:20,627
You know,

220
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,596
-I'm nervous.
-What for?

221
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:23,764
-Why?
-Is it the smell?

222
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:26,266
Do you usually dislike this type of smell?

223
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,401
WHY IS TAEHOON NERVOUS?

224
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:32,940
Usually, when I eat the innards,
I can't eat it if it has a strong smell.

225
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:35,509
-I see.
-I'm picky when it comes to pork.

226
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:38,478
I thought chefs would like
almost everything.

227
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:40,180
Chefs dislike some foods, too.

228
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,849
EXACTLY

229
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,417
-Try the broth first.
-Yum.

230
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:45,219
-Shall we try it?
-Yes.

231
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:46,753
STARTING OFF WITH THE BROTH

232
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:48,322
Have some broth first.

233
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:50,490
SERVING EACH OF THEM A SCOOPFUL

234
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:52,793
-Serve him first. Try a little.
-Thank you.

235
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,462
SERVED FIRST TO THE BEGINNER

236
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,130
Shall we toast?

237
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:58,532
-Cheers.
-Shall we?

238
00:09:58,599 --> 00:09:59,800
-Cheers.
-Of course.

239
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:02,069
-Thank you.
-Cheers.

240
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:03,670
BOTTOMS UP

241
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:08,609
TAEHOON CAREFULLY SIPS IT

242
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:11,078
It tastes nice and clean.

243
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,714
-How does it taste?
-It's good.

244
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,682
Right now for me,

245
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,417
TAEHOON'S FIRST IMPRESSION

246
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:18,719
-I like it.
-Really?

247
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:19,820
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

248
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:21,455
A POSITIVE START

249
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:26,360
TAKING ONE MORE SIP WITH AN OPEN MIND

250
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:27,995
It's smooth.

251
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:30,163
How do I say this?

252
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,901
I thought it would have a thick texture.

253
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,769
But it's lighter than I thought.

254
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:38,138
-It's kind of like spicy fish stew.
-Exactly.

255
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:40,574
It tastes like spicy fish stew
like Namno said.

256
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:45,479
If you compare the innards
of beef and pork,

257
00:10:45,546 --> 00:10:47,181
beef has a milder taste.

258
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,583
-People are more hesitant about pork.
-Right.

259
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:53,654
But this place resolved
most of those problems.

260
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,088
It has a clean scent to it.

261
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,292
When I first came here, I only had
the broth because my teeth hurt.

262
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,828
Then, I kept coming back here
for the broth.

263
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:07,568
BEGINNERS WILL EASILY ENJOY
THIS REFRESHING BROTH

264
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,638
How can <i>gopchang </i>hot pot taste like this?

265
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:17,578
I carefully asked the owner
for the secret to this broth.

266
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:19,947
I'm curious since I'm a chef.

267
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:23,150
You can use pork stock,
but they only use mineral water.

268
00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:24,885
-Mineral water?
-That's why.

269
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:26,320
That's why it has a clean flavor.

270
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:30,891
If they had used pork stock,
Chef Taehoon might not have liked it.

271
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,260
-They added crown daisy.
-Yes, and perilla leaf.

272
00:11:33,327 --> 00:11:35,429
That's why it tasted like spicy fish stew.

273
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:39,333
TWO SECRETS TO THIS PORK <i>GOPCHANG </i>HOT POT

274
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,969
1. ADD MINERAL WATER INSTEAD OF STOCK

275
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,771
IT KEEPS THE BROTH SMOOTH

276
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:49,810
ONCE THE MINERAL WATER STARTS TO BOIL

277
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,847
2. ADD FRAGRANT CROWN DAISY
AND PERILLA LEAVES

278
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:59,887
ALL OF THESE BLEND WELL TOGETHER

279
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:05,025
AND THEIR SIGNATURE BROTH IS MADE

280
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:06,860
How did you two become friends?

281
00:12:07,628 --> 00:12:10,964
When we were in 9th grade, I entered
a high school entrance exam contest.

282
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:13,333
-A contest?
-Yes, for a culinary school in Busan.

283
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,603
<i>-Namno won first place, as always.</i>
<i>-Gyeongjin won second place.</i>

284
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:18,639
-Even at that time?
-Yes.

285
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:21,808
Namno took the elite course in cooking.

286
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,777
It wasn't that sophisticated.

287
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:26,847
-That's how we became friends.
-You two became close.

288
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:28,749
My parents ran a Chinese restaurant.

289
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:31,351
I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THAT

290
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,221
<i>At that time, I asked Namno</i>
<i>what he wanted to eat.</i>

291
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:36,123
<i>-He said he wanted </i>jjamppong.
<i>-I see.</i>

292
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,558
<i>We ate that together.</i>

293
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:43,063
<i>After we gradually got close,</i>
<i>I asked if he was planning to enroll.</i>

294
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,966
Namno wanted to enroll,
but he had no place to stay.

295
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:48,535
-He must've lived in Seoul.
-That's right.

296
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:51,271
-And you were a student.
-Yes, he was a minor.

297
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:56,910
I told my parents he wanted to attend the
school. I asked if he could live with us.

298
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:59,613
-That's insane.
-I got permission the day I met him.

299
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,316
-Your parents were amazing.
-Like marriage approval.

300
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:05,452
<i>Starting then, we went to school</i>
<i>and lived together.</i>

301
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,455
THEY STARTED LIVING TOGETHER

302
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,824
For 2.5 years, we were always together.

303
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:13,260
-I see.
-Unless we went to the bathroom.

304
00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:15,929
It's true. We were together all the time.

305
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,632
A NEW MEMBER IN GYEONGJIN'S FAMILY

306
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:21,935
THEY EVEN TOOK FAMILY TRIPS TOGETHER

307
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:26,673
THEY EVEN WENT
ON EXTENDED FAMILY TRIPS TOGETHER

308
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,675
But for two and a half years,

309
00:13:29,343 --> 00:13:33,080
-you must've thought of him as your rival.
-That's right.

310
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,214
While living together?

311
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:36,650
It's kind of like that movie <i>The Match.</i>

312
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,318
I agree.

313
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:41,788
Sometimes, he was my rival,
and other times, he was a great friend.

314
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:42,856
-Right.
-I see.

315
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:45,425
CHEF'S GO-TO

316
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,427
<i>I have my own way of eating this </i>gopchang.

317
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:50,197
As you can see, the pieces are really big.

318
00:13:50,264 --> 00:13:53,934
HUGE <i>GOPCHANG </i>PIECES IN THE POT,
TOO BIG TO EAT IN ONE BITE

319
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:55,102
-It's big.
-Yes.

320
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:56,537
But I don't cut it.

321
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:59,139
Do you eat it as it is?
Isn't it tough to chew?

322
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:00,707
-Will it be okay?
-The thing is…

323
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:02,943
It's surprisingly soft for its size.

324
00:14:03,644 --> 00:14:05,812
Here's how I eat this.

325
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,748
First, I let it cool off since it's hot.

326
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:09,550
-Let it cool off.
-Right.

327
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:12,319
Dip it in the broth like it's a sauce,
then eat it.

328
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:14,388
DIPPING IT IN SOUP
AND EATING IT IN ONE BITE

329
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:19,259
It's soft despite the size.

330
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,262
So, we dip it like
when we eat shabu-shabu.

331
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:29,036
Gosh, it's so tender.

332
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:36,109
ENJOYING THE CHEWY TEXTURE
OF <i>GOPCHANG </i>DIPPED IN BROTH

333
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:37,511
It's softer than I thought.

334
00:14:37,578 --> 00:14:39,012
I thought it would be tough.

335
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:41,448
-It tastes good with a clean aftertaste.
-Yes.

336
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:43,016
MEANWHILE

337
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,651
Oh, it's so soft.

338
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:45,719
How is it?

339
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:49,323
-Oh, no.
-He doesn't…

340
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,791
-Taehoon…
-Hold on.

341
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:52,793
You can't always enjoy all the food.

342
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,429
I can read his mind.

343
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:57,965
-You want to cut it, don't you?
-Yes.

344
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,535
-I see.
-For what reason?

345
00:15:01,602 --> 00:15:03,604
It's my preference.

346
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:08,275
If you want to enjoy
the soft and chewy texture in your mouth,

347
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:10,277
you can eat it in one bite.

348
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:13,213
-But I just personally like to cut it up.
-Sure.

349
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,748
Don't just sit there. Cut it.

350
00:15:14,815 --> 00:15:16,783
CUTTING IT FOR <i>GOPCHANG </i>HOT POT BEGINNERS

351
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:21,355
WILL THIS MAKE A DIFFERENCE?

352
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,625
I'll take a bite of the piece.

353
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:27,427
-Can we dip it in here?
-I'll try it with the special sauce.

354
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:32,232
HOW WILL IT TASTE THIS TIME?

355
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,401
SUPER NERVOUS

356
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:35,936
It's easier to swallow.

357
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:38,305
Everyone, please cut the <i>gopchang</i>
when you're here.

358
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:39,506
That's right.

359
00:15:39,573 --> 00:15:41,308
-It's nice as it is, too.
-Thanks.

360
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,609
WE RESPECT EVERYONE'S TASTE

361
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:45,846
-Try the sauce. It's good.
-Okay.

362
00:15:45,913 --> 00:15:48,248
-It has a special ingredient.
-What's inside?

363
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:51,151
-Is this perilla powder on top?
-Yes.

364
00:15:51,652 --> 00:15:52,653
-It's thick.
-Right.

365
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:59,259
TAKING A BITE WITH PLENTY OF SAUCE

366
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:03,163
-It goes well together.
-It does.

367
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:06,099
With the powder,
it tastes like backbone stew.

368
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,167
-Exactly.
-Right?

369
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,770
Even more
with perilla leaf and crown daisy.

370
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:13,273
PERFECT PAIRING OF <i>GOPCHANG</i>
WITH CROWN DAISY AND PERILLA LEAF

371
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:18,278
AND THE SPECIAL SAUCE
WITH PLENTY OF PERILLA POWDER

372
00:16:18,946 --> 00:16:20,914
Let me try the broth again.

373
00:16:21,682 --> 00:16:24,718
Hot pot usually tastes better
the longer you simmer it.

374
00:16:24,785 --> 00:16:25,886
-Right.
-I agree.

375
00:16:25,953 --> 00:16:27,688
I'll give it another try.

376
00:16:31,592 --> 00:16:33,594
At first, it tasted like

377
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:36,597
-freshly boiled spicy fish stew.
-Right.

378
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:37,664
But now…

379
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:42,369
the umami really stands out.

380
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:43,871
THE RICH UMAMI INTENSIFIES

381
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,843
-It got much thicker.
-Yes, it's getting thicker.

382
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,178
One more important thing.

383
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:53,347
After cooking it for a long time,

384
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:54,615
-it's softer now.
-It is.

385
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:59,052
That's right. They pre-boiled it,
but it gets cooked once again here.

386
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,120
It's really tender.

387
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,990
For Chef Gyeongjin…

388
00:17:03,891 --> 00:17:05,058
-Thanks.
-…I won't cut it.

389
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,293
All right.

390
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,195
HAVING FUN

391
00:17:08,262 --> 00:17:10,864
Namno, please bring the veggies
for the wrap.

392
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,867
-They have veggies for wraps?
-Yes, over there.

393
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:17,271
They have unlimited servings
of perilla leaves and crown daisies.

394
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:23,010
These veggies are expensive these days,
but it's unlimited here.

395
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,778
Do we add them in?

396
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:27,147
Is there a special way to eat this?

397
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:29,883
You can add them in the pot
or make a wrap.

398
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,218
-A wrap?
-Yes.

399
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:33,420
-Try it as a wrap.
-Let's try it.

400
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:36,089
Don't these look so fresh?

401
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,625
GRASSY SCENT

402
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:40,961
Add plenty of <i>gopchang.</i>

403
00:17:41,028 --> 00:17:42,629
-Yes.
-Gosh, that's hot.

404
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:45,365
I'll add lots of sauce.

405
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:46,667
PLENTY OF THE SPECIAL SAUCE

406
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:51,071
DUJUN EATS HIS HANDMADE WRAP

407
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:58,312
HE USES HIS MOUTH TO WRAP THE INGREDIENTS

408
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,114
TAEHOON ALSO TRIES THE WRAP

409
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:05,252
When making a wrap,
it has to be strongly seasoned.

410
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:07,421
Man, it's amazing.

411
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:09,423
-The aroma?
-Yes.

412
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,291
I think

413
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:13,961
SUDDENLY GETTING ANXIOUS

414
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:15,562
I'll come here to eat this.

415
00:18:15,629 --> 00:18:16,830
Definitely.

416
00:18:16,897 --> 00:18:19,132
We've tried the cooked perilla leaves,

417
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:23,070
but wrapping it in uncooked perilla leaf
tastes very fresh.

418
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:24,238
DOUBLE THE FRESHNESS

419
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:28,075
The perilla leaf balances out
the strong flavor of the <i>gopchang.</i>

420
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,610
-Right.
-It's captivating.

421
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:33,514
FALLING IN LOVE WITH <i>GOPCHANG</i>

422
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,317
-I'm glad that you like it.
-You seem to be enjoying it.

423
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:38,385
It's delicious.

424
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:40,220
You must've been worried.

425
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:42,456
It would've been perfect

426
00:18:42,523 --> 00:18:44,191
-if you had cut the <i>gopchang.</i>
-Right.

427
00:18:44,258 --> 00:18:46,159
-But still--
-You insisted on that.

428
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:48,195
That's how we get to know each other.

429
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:50,631
I brought something today.

430
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:52,599
I heard Namno once made

431
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,635
-a perilla leaf drink for you.
-Hold on.

432
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:56,003
-What's that?
-I prepared

433
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:58,472
a 007 briefcase like James Bond.

434
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:00,007
What is all that?

435
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:01,208
What did you bring?

436
00:19:01,275 --> 00:19:04,311
-I was told to do whatever I wanted.
-Go for it.

437
00:19:04,378 --> 00:19:05,512
Do whatever you want.

438
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:06,813
DO AS YOU WISH, CHEF

439
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,116
-Isn't this a metal briefcase?
-Yes.

440
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,484
-Have a look.
-Oh my gosh.

441
00:19:11,185 --> 00:19:13,754
I brought this so you can
fully enjoy the food here.

442
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:18,992
FULL OF PROFESSIONAL COOKING TOOLS

443
00:19:20,294 --> 00:19:24,198
FILLED WITH VARIOUS INGREDIENTS
AND CONDIMENTS

444
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:27,601
You should've filmed in the kitchen.
Why did you bring all this?

445
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:30,971
I know Namno makes lots of cocktails

446
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:32,606
-by mixing soju and beer<i>.</i>
-Look.

447
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:34,474
-Yes, he makes cocktails.
-Right.

448
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,343
Let me make you a cocktail today.

449
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,645
-On the spot?
-Of course.

450
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:41,014
-Try it and give an honest opinion.
-Okay.

451
00:19:41,081 --> 00:19:43,450
The perilla leaf cocktail
he made last time was good.

452
00:19:43,984 --> 00:19:47,721
APPEARED IN THE FIRST EPISODE
OF <i>CHEF'S GO-TO</i>

453
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,724
THE MOJITO BLEW EVERYONE AWAY

454
00:19:51,058 --> 00:19:53,493
WILL GYEONGJIN OUTDO NAMNO?

455
00:19:53,994 --> 00:19:58,131
I used to make this often
when I was studying abroad in Japan.

456
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,000
This is <i>umeboshi.</i>

457
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:03,237
<i>-Umeboshi?</i>
-Yes, it's pickled green plum.

458
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:06,340
-In Korea, we use sugar to make it.
-Yes.

459
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:09,176
But Japan adds salt to it.

460
00:20:09,243 --> 00:20:12,379
In other words,
this cocktail includes salt.

461
00:20:12,446 --> 00:20:13,914
-Does it taste salty?
-Yes.

462
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:15,349
I wonder how it tastes.

463
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:17,951
-That's how they make highball in Japan.
-Right.

464
00:20:18,986 --> 00:20:20,153
So, you crush it.

465
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,990
This is <i>shiso </i>which we are familiar with.

466
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,759
-Red <i>shiso.</i>
-Red ones.

467
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,096
I only used perilla leaves and soda.

468
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:31,398
Why did you bring so much?

469
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,169
CHEF GYEONGJIN STAYS FOCUSED,
PUSHES THROUGH

470
00:20:36,136 --> 00:20:38,839
THE <i>UMEBOSHI </i>COCKTAIL IS READY

471
00:20:39,473 --> 00:20:40,541
Let's make a toast.

472
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:42,142
LET'S TRY THE COCKTAIL

473
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:43,310
-Thank you.
-Cheers.

474
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:47,748
CHUGS IT DOWN DESPITE COMPLAINING ABOUT IT

475
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:50,551
-It tastes a bit salty.
-It sure does.

476
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:54,288
-When we sweat in summer, we lose sodium.
-We need to replenish it.

477
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:55,355
Exactly.

478
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:58,625
How is it? You've tasted both of ours.

479
00:20:59,026 --> 00:21:00,460
WHICH ONE DOES DUJUN LIKE?

480
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:02,896
Namno wins!

481
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,531
I'm joking.

482
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,466
JUST JOKING

483
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:07,801
-I like yours.
-Thank you.

484
00:21:07,868 --> 00:21:10,537
I like this more
because I love the <i>shiso </i>aroma.

485
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:11,839
Got it.

486
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:14,007
It hits the spot. It's so tasty.

487
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:16,410
-And it pairs well with <i>gopchang.</i>
-Right.

488
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:17,744
I totally agree.

489
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:20,013
It tones down the greasiness.

490
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,081
It's irresistible.

491
00:21:21,515 --> 00:21:24,685
-Then, am I the winner?
-Of course, you win.

492
00:21:25,052 --> 00:21:26,119
I'm loving it.

493
00:21:26,186 --> 00:21:27,988
MEANWHILE, HIS COCKTAIL IS UNFINISHED

494
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:30,157
OH, NO

495
00:21:30,224 --> 00:21:31,358
Let me explain.

496
00:21:31,425 --> 00:21:33,994
This drink contains a range of aromas.

497
00:21:34,061 --> 00:21:37,831
I love the aromas, but it tastes…

498
00:21:37,898 --> 00:21:38,932
-Salty?
-…salty.

499
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:40,033
I see.

500
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,569
It's salty, but I haven't sweated enough.

501
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:44,137
Do you not like Chef Gyeongjin?

502
00:21:44,204 --> 00:21:45,205
-Do you hate me?
-No.

503
00:21:45,272 --> 00:21:46,840
-Oh.
-You didn't like his cocktail.

504
00:21:46,907 --> 00:21:49,209
-Hey, I liked the <i>gopchang. </i>It's good.
-Got it.

505
00:21:50,244 --> 00:21:52,679
-Taehoon, wait a minute.
-He's adorable.

506
00:21:52,746 --> 00:21:54,781
I'll make a sauce for you.

507
00:21:54,848 --> 00:21:57,885
<i>Namno will make a food pairing.</i>

508
00:21:57,951 --> 00:21:58,952
<i>Will Namno go first?</i>

509
00:21:59,853 --> 00:22:01,121
He has a high success rate.

510
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:02,856
-For food pairings?
-Yes.

511
00:22:02,923 --> 00:22:04,691
-He won last week, too.
-I see.

512
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:07,427
Today's penalty is paying
for everything we eat today.

513
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:11,198
-We'll go to other spots to eat after.
-Sure.

514
00:22:11,265 --> 00:22:12,366
Covering the bill?

515
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:14,168
-Everything?
-I'm in.

516
00:22:14,234 --> 00:22:15,536
SOUNDS GREAT, I'M IN

517
00:22:16,103 --> 00:22:17,204
I'll start first.

518
00:22:17,271 --> 00:22:20,641
Every country has dishes
made with innards.

519
00:22:21,241 --> 00:22:23,177
<i>There's </i>motsunabe <i>in Japan.</i>

520
00:22:23,243 --> 00:22:25,045
<i>-Right.</i>
<i>-Yes, it's </i>daechang <i>hot pot.</i>

521
00:22:25,112 --> 00:22:27,047
<i>And there's a dip for it.</i>

522
00:22:27,114 --> 00:22:28,982
SOY SAUCE MIXED WITH YUZU AND VINEGAR

523
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:30,817
I'll make a Japanese-style sauce.

524
00:22:31,585 --> 00:22:34,154
I'll only use soy sauce and vinegar.

525
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:36,356
-Soy sauce with vinegar?
-Yes.

526
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:39,092
We already have a great sauce here.
I'll mix these three.

527
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,195
Today's pairing is too simple.

528
00:22:41,628 --> 00:22:44,631
-Wait, you will love this.
-You don't look too excited.

529
00:22:45,399 --> 00:22:47,267
When you add this in,

530
00:22:47,334 --> 00:22:49,870
add a bit more of the vinegar.

531
00:22:49,937 --> 00:22:52,039
NAMNO'S PAIRING:
1. ADD VINEGAR TO SOY SAUCE

532
00:22:52,506 --> 00:22:54,575
2. ADD PLENTY OF THE SPECIAL SAUCE

533
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:56,376
He's putting in a generous amount.

534
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:58,145
Like this.

535
00:22:58,212 --> 00:22:59,613
3. MIX THE SAUCE UNTIL SMOOTH

536
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,582
-That's not all, is it?
-I'm done.

537
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:04,918
-It looks like a fried dumpling dip.
-Exactly.

538
00:23:04,985 --> 00:23:06,720
Like <i>doubanjiang </i>with chili powder.

539
00:23:06,787 --> 00:23:08,722
-Enjoy.
-I'm excited.

540
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:12,893
SAUCE BY NAMNO, THE REIGNING CHAMPION

541
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,294
Dunk it in.

542
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:16,296
WILL THEY LIKE IT?

543
00:23:16,363 --> 00:23:19,099
It's good.

544
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,401
Wait. My gosh.

545
00:23:22,603 --> 00:23:25,506
-Eating it with this sauce…
-It's totally different.

546
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:26,607
Absolutely.

547
00:23:28,442 --> 00:23:30,043
-It's nice.
-This is the stuff.

548
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:34,481
He added lots of vinegar,
so it tasted somewhat refreshing

549
00:23:34,548 --> 00:23:35,782
and even more refined.

550
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:38,352
<i>Gopchang </i>always leaves an oily aftertaste.

551
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:40,354
-It's greasy.
-Exactly.

552
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,089
I love this soy sauce with vinegar.

553
00:23:42,155 --> 00:23:45,692
When eating Japan's <i>motsunabe,</i>
you dip it in ponzu.

554
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:48,762
Ponzu is a blend mainly
of soy sauce and vinegar.

555
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:51,598
It cuts through the greasiness and smell.

556
00:23:51,665 --> 00:23:54,601
-It softens the strong taste of innards.
-Right.

557
00:23:54,668 --> 00:23:57,604
It's smooth and delicious,
so you can eat more.

558
00:23:57,671 --> 00:23:59,206
ONE MORE DELICIOUS BITE

559
00:24:00,974 --> 00:24:02,709
I MIGHT LOSE…

560
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:06,146
-Let me open up the 007 briefcase again.
-Sure.

561
00:24:06,747 --> 00:24:08,448
-He's got everything.
-Of course.

562
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:09,516
What is it?

563
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,552
Oh, I know this!

564
00:24:12,686 --> 00:24:13,687
Hey.

565
00:24:13,754 --> 00:24:15,656
A MYSTERIOUS-LOOKING MORTAR AND PESTLE

566
00:24:15,722 --> 00:24:17,624
-Are those pine nuts?
-Yes.

567
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:21,128
Whenever I come here,

568
00:24:21,195 --> 00:24:25,199
I've always thought
these crown daisies tasted good.

569
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:28,569
I thought of making crown daisy pesto
like basil pesto.

570
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:30,671
-That's a good idea.
-Right.

571
00:24:30,737 --> 00:24:34,541
-Everyone, pesto is made with no heat.
-Yes, you grind fresh ingredients.

572
00:24:35,175 --> 00:24:37,277
It brings out the freshness.

573
00:24:37,344 --> 00:24:39,847
Traditionally, you grind it
with a mortar and pestle.

574
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:42,516
-Do they do that in Europe?
-Yes.

575
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:45,319
HOW BASIL PESTO IS MADE

576
00:24:45,385 --> 00:24:48,121
CHEF GYEONGJIN'S PAIRING

577
00:24:48,188 --> 00:24:50,290
-Add some garlic.
-Garlic.

578
00:24:50,357 --> 00:24:51,491
-I see.
-Garlic.

579
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:53,527
1. GRIND PINE NUTS AND GARLIC

580
00:24:55,062 --> 00:24:57,264
WORKING HARD

581
00:24:57,331 --> 00:24:58,332
It won't take long.

582
00:24:58,866 --> 00:25:01,902
It's taking too long.
Bring a blender next time.

583
00:25:02,503 --> 00:25:05,172
-I'll make it at my own pace.
-Of course.

584
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:06,874
-Take your time.
-It's important

585
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,910
for chefs not to be swayed by others.

586
00:25:09,977 --> 00:25:14,081
This place is known for their delicious
and fresh crown daisies.

587
00:25:14,147 --> 00:25:19,353
3. GRIND PLENTY OF CROWN DAISIES
IN THE EMPTY MORTAR

588
00:25:20,087 --> 00:25:22,122
-You're grinding all of them.
-Yes.

589
00:25:22,189 --> 00:25:24,925
-The aroma--
-Yes, it brings out the scent.

590
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,528
Add the garlic.

591
00:25:27,594 --> 00:25:30,130
4. ADD ALL THE GROUND INGREDIENTS
AND DRIZZLE LIME JUICE

592
00:25:30,764 --> 00:25:32,866
-What's that?
-It's lime.

593
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:36,803
5. GIVE EVERYTHING A LIGHT GRIND ONCE MORE

594
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,505
-Is that it?
-Yes.

595
00:25:38,572 --> 00:25:40,274
-That's it?
-Yes.

596
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:43,410
-Oh, you don't grind it finely.
-That's the key.

597
00:25:45,245 --> 00:25:48,448
-The crown daisy aroma smells different.
-Isn't it nice?

598
00:25:48,515 --> 00:25:51,485
-It's cool.
-It's better if you take a bigger bite.

599
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:55,322
TAEHOON TASTES A BIT OF THE SAUCE

600
00:25:55,956 --> 00:25:57,124
IS IT THAT GOOD?

601
00:25:57,191 --> 00:25:58,258
It's good.

602
00:25:58,325 --> 00:25:59,760
Load it up.

603
00:25:59,826 --> 00:26:04,531
THE ALL-TIME SECOND PLACE
CHEF GYEONGJIN IS EAGER TO WIN

604
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:11,238
HOW DOES THE CROWN DAISY PESTO TASTE?

605
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:14,508
NAMNO AND TAEHOON EACH HAVE A BITE

606
00:26:14,842 --> 00:26:16,343
Oh, it has an exotic flavor.

607
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:18,145
How interesting.

608
00:26:18,212 --> 00:26:21,014
THE MAGICAL SAUCE TURNS IT
INTO A DISH FROM ANOTHER CULTURE

609
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:23,517
-We're familiar with basil pesto.
-Yes.

610
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:28,155
I think crown daisies are
just as good as European herbs.

611
00:26:29,056 --> 00:26:31,491
The pine nut aroma lingers in my mouth.

612
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:34,228
<i>I ground them roughly on purpose.</i>

613
00:26:34,294 --> 00:26:36,496
THE PINE NUTS PERFECTED THE SAUCE

614
00:26:36,563 --> 00:26:38,332
Who will be the judge?

615
00:26:38,632 --> 00:26:39,800
Let's ask the customers.

616
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:41,235
SHALL WE ASK THE REGULARS?

617
00:26:41,301 --> 00:26:42,569
-That sounds fun.
-Yes.

618
00:26:42,636 --> 00:26:43,971
How about the citizens here?

619
00:26:44,538 --> 00:26:47,674
-Pick the one that tastes better.
-Got it.

620
00:26:47,741 --> 00:26:50,344
Do you have any <i>gopchang </i>left?
Dip it in this sauce.

621
00:26:51,645 --> 00:26:52,646
THE JUDGES TRY IT

622
00:26:52,713 --> 00:26:53,714
I'm curious.

623
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,083
They're very serious.

624
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:57,851
Excuse me, can I say something?

625
00:26:57,918 --> 00:26:59,186
This only took ten seconds.

626
00:26:59,253 --> 00:27:00,821
-That's not fair.
-Ten seconds.

627
00:27:00,888 --> 00:27:02,823
-It's competitive.
-I came here to win.

628
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,725
I'M HERE TO WIN

629
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,093
So, who is the winner?

630
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,428
I'm feeling nervous.

631
00:27:09,263 --> 00:27:10,864
A REVENGE MATCH OF CHILDHOOD RIVALS

632
00:27:11,365 --> 00:27:12,366
THE WINNER IS

633
00:27:12,432 --> 00:27:13,600
-Who is it?
-Be honest.

634
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:15,536
CHEF LEE GYEONGJIN

635
00:27:16,103 --> 00:27:17,304
Really?

636
00:27:17,704 --> 00:27:19,039
Gosh, congratulations.

637
00:27:20,274 --> 00:27:21,575
I didn't set this up.

638
00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:23,343
Why did you choose his sauce?

639
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,179
-We voted.
-Okay.

640
00:27:25,245 --> 00:27:28,215
The crown daisy and perilla leaf
tasted familiar.

641
00:27:28,282 --> 00:27:30,651
-Right.
-It went well with the <i>gopchang.</i>

642
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:34,388
-Crown daisy is the key ingredient here.
-Exactly.

643
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:37,324
He must have gotten bonus points for that.

644
00:27:37,391 --> 00:27:40,327
Do you want everyone here
to start grinding the ingredients?

645
00:27:40,861 --> 00:27:41,929
OUR CHOICE STANDS

646
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:43,430
With a mortar and pestle.

647
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:45,098
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

648
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:46,733
Today's loser, Yoon Namno.

649
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,801
Yoon Namno!

650
00:27:48,435 --> 00:27:49,570
-Hey.
-Namno is treating.

651
00:27:49,636 --> 00:27:51,138
I was going to cover the bill.

652
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:53,507
-Since your friend came?
-Yes.

653
00:27:53,974 --> 00:27:57,845
Lastly, fried rice is a must
in this restaurant.

654
00:27:57,911 --> 00:27:59,346
Do we have to eat more?

655
00:27:59,413 --> 00:28:02,282
-Shall we have a taste?
-Just one serving.

656
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:05,185
USING THE <i>GOPCHANG </i>POT TO MAKE FRIED RICE

657
00:28:05,252 --> 00:28:06,253
There's garlic.

658
00:28:06,787 --> 00:28:07,888
Here's the fried rice.

659
00:28:08,889 --> 00:28:10,791
-It's the classic one.
-I love the smell.

660
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:13,527
ALREADY GIVES OFF A SAVORY SCENT

661
00:28:13,594 --> 00:28:15,128
Auntie, it's so delicious.

662
00:28:15,195 --> 00:28:16,196
Thank you.

663
00:28:18,165 --> 00:28:21,969
THE FRIED RICE INGREDIENTS
COME TOGETHER IN THE POT

664
00:28:25,072 --> 00:28:26,073
It looks great.

665
00:28:27,608 --> 00:28:30,577
THE FRIED RICE IS FINISHED
RIGHT BEFORE THEIR EYES

666
00:28:30,644 --> 00:28:32,412
Let's dig in.

667
00:28:33,013 --> 00:28:35,349
-I like to scorch fried rice…
-Do you scorch it?

668
00:28:35,415 --> 00:28:36,517
-…before I eat.
-Yes.

669
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:39,019
Then, I scrape it off.
That's the fun of it.

670
00:28:40,787 --> 00:28:46,093
HAVING A BITE OF SCORCHED FRIED RICE

671
00:28:47,361 --> 00:28:49,930
THE FLAVOR OF PORK <i>GOPCHANG </i>HOT POT
SEEPS INTO THE RICE

672
00:28:49,997 --> 00:28:52,833
What's interesting is
that it tastes like spicy fish stew.

673
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,936
-The more you eat it.
-It gets richer.

674
00:28:56,003 --> 00:28:57,371
It's not too heavy, either.

675
00:28:57,704 --> 00:29:00,841
Overall, the food tastes crisp and clean.

676
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:06,513
FULLY ENJOYED THE MEAL
FROM START TO FINISH

677
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,248
This was our first meal of the day.

678
00:29:08,315 --> 00:29:11,985
-Honestly, I felt a bit worried…
-Right.

679
00:29:12,052 --> 00:29:13,754
…to eat <i>gopchang </i>hot pot.

680
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:18,225
But it was gentler on the stomach
than any other dish.

681
00:29:18,792 --> 00:29:20,160
And it tasted amazing.

682
00:29:20,227 --> 00:29:23,830
I loved the <i>umeboshi </i>highball
he made for us.

683
00:29:23,897 --> 00:29:25,365
I was super happy today.

684
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:28,035
It was the best daytime drink
and bar snack.

685
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:31,038
If I had to describe it
in terms of alcohol,

686
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:33,774
it was like drinking a bottle of wine.

687
00:29:34,308 --> 00:29:38,478
Wine tastes different
depending on when you drink it.

688
00:29:39,379 --> 00:29:40,380
WHAT A GREAT COMMENT

689
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:42,549
You sounded so cool.

690
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:47,721
The <i>gopchang </i>hot pot tasted
completely different from start to finish.

691
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:49,423
First it was light and rich later.

692
00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:50,924
-As time passed?
-Yes.

693
00:29:50,991 --> 00:29:52,926
It was like enjoying a glass of wine.

694
00:29:54,027 --> 00:29:56,630
<i>-That was awesome.</i>
<i>-Thank you.</i>

695
00:29:57,231 --> 00:29:58,232
<i>What a great meal.</i>

696
00:30:04,505 --> 00:30:05,739
EUNHA GOPCHANG

697
00:30:05,806 --> 00:30:09,343
As time passes by,
the fried rice sticks to the pot.

698
00:30:09,409 --> 00:30:11,778
We will turn this into porridge.

699
00:30:11,845 --> 00:30:13,213
-Porridge?
-Yes.

702
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,895
Man, it's mouth-watering.

703
00:30:28,462 --> 00:30:29,563
-Let's try it.
-Sure.

704
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:30,631
It looks terrific.

705
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:34,201
THE FOODIE BROTHERS
DEVOUR THE FOOD ENDLESSLY

706
00:30:35,435 --> 00:30:36,670
Thank you for the food.

707
00:30:36,737 --> 00:30:38,238
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

708
00:30:38,305 --> 00:30:39,640
-Are you paying in full?
-Hmm?

709
00:30:39,706 --> 00:30:41,008
-In full?
-Do I look poor?
