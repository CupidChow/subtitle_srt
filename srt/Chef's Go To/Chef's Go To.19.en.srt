I'm loving the vibes here, David.

9
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,027
It's unique, isn't it?

10
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,463
SPACIOUS AREA WITH A CASUAL DESIGN

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,631

00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:37,804
IT FEELS SOMEWHAT EXOTIC HERE

14
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:41,575
-Did you recommend this place yourself?
-Yes, I did.

15
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:43,443
I'm a regular here.

16
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:48,782
A lot of American-style barbecue spots
have popped up in Korea.

17
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:50,918
-This is one of the first ones.
-Really?

18
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:53,720
So, it helped introduce
American-style barbecue here.

19
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,591
-Man, you can hear the knife sharpening.
-It's insane.

20
00:00:57,658 --> 00:01:00,060
WE ARE NOW OPEN

00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:05,098
MOUTHWATERING VISUALS

22
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,035
<i>-Are we having a meat party?</i>
<i>-Of course.</i>

23
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,604
-Guests are a must at a party.
-Exactly.

24
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:13,640
I invited a friend to today's party.

25
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:15,209
-A chef?
-No.

26
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,110
Okay, they're not.

27
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:20,380
She became the CEO
of her own company recently.

28
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:21,582
SHE STARTED A BUSINESS

29
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,650
<i>What kind of business?</i>

30
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,419
<i>She's in the fashion industry.</i>

31
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:26,854
SHE STARTED A FASHION BUSINESS

32
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,690
She's also a celebrity.

33
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,459
She won an Excellence Award
at the awards show.

34
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:34,528
<i>I wonder who she is. I bet she's famous.</i>

35
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:38,398
<i>-Isn't that the second-place prize?</i>
<i>-Yes, it's just below the Grand Prize.</i>

36
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:41,568
And the third clue is
that she's an actress.

37
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,039
-Is she the same age as you?
-Yes, she is.

38
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,174
-Really?
-Yes.

39
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:49,977
I'm also surprised.
I can't believe an actress is my friend.

40
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:54,515
Wow, I have absolutely no clue who she is.

41
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:56,817
This is it.

42
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:59,052
"Chef's Go-To."

43
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:01,889
Who is she?

44
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:03,557
Oh, she's here.

45
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:05,559
-Oh, she's here.
-Wait.

46
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,827
-Hold on.
-Hello.

48
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,065
Hello, my friend!

49
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,138
NOT ONLY DOES SHE STAR
IN MOVIES, DRAMAS, AND VARIETY SHOWS,

50
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:22,176
BUT SHE ALSO STARTED
A Y*UTUBE CHANNEL AND A BUSINESS

00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:25,879
TODAY'S GUEST
SONG JIHYO

52
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:28,081
Hi, there. My friend.

53
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,783
Long time no see.

54
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,386
-Nice to see you.
-Dujun, how have you been?

55
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,054
It's a pleasure to meet you.

56
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:35,489
GREETING DUJUN AND NAMNO

57
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:36,790
They're the same age?

58
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:39,960
-I was taken aback as well.
-Stop it. Please sit down.

59
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:42,563
-It's great to see you.
-You too.

60
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,565
-Dujun, it's been a really long time.
-Yes.

61
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:48,769
I met her ten years ago
while shooting for <i>Running Man.</i>

62
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,604
-That long ago?
-Yes, over ten years.

63
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,873
How do you two know each other?

64
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,577
We went to Vietnam together
to shoot a show.

65
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,913
<i>Honestly, I first knew him as a chef.</i>

66
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,548
SHE ONLY THOUGHT HE WAS A CHEF

67
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:04,718
And I was shocked to hear
he was the same age as me.

68
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:07,788
-I told her to show me her ID.
-We showed our IDs.

69
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:08,856
She didn't believe me.

70
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,292
<i>I had a fun time.</i>

71
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,228
<i>I had such a great time in Vietnam.</i>

72
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:15,529
<i>I had fun, too.</i>

73
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,531
<i>It was such a nice time.</i>

74
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:19,266
THAT'S HOW THEY BECAME FRIENDS

75
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:22,135
-We drank a ton.
-Right.

76
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,504
I see.

77
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,639
-She's a true friend.
-Absolutely.

78
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,976
How often do you come here?

79
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:30,844
About once a week.

80
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,446
-Once a week?
-Really?

81
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:34,648
My family loves it here.

82
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,384
<i>The kids love the food.</i>
<i>"Dad, let's go to Linus'."</i>

83
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:38,986
HIS KIDS LOVE THIS PLACE

84
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,289
ESPECIALLY HIS YOUNGEST, MATTHEW

85
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:49,162
HE HAS BEEN EATING MEAT HERE
WITH HIS BARE HANDS SINCE HE WAS A BABY

86
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:53,066
-I love the vibes here.
-Isn't it great?

87
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,968
<i>-It's like a foreign country.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>

88
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:56,937
<i>There are many foreigners here.</i>

89
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,207
<i>They might think</i>
<i>they're in a different country.</i>

90
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:03,210
IT'S BUSTLING WITH FOREIGN GUESTS
AT AN EARLY HOUR

91
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:07,080
That's why I became a regular here.

92
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:10,584
Since I lived abroad for a long time,

93
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:13,720
this place cheers me up
whenever I miss it.

94
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,023
Where are you from?

95
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,492
-I'm from New York.
-Oh, New York?

96
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,594
SUDDENLY STARTED SPEAKING IN ENGLISH

97
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:22,129
I can't believe we're sober.

98
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:26,667
-These two were always drunk.
-They have a similar sense of humor.

99
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:31,538
Since you're here, we should have a party.

100
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,140
Let's order some party food.

101
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:34,508
You know he's a meat-lover.

102
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:37,811
But for me,
eating meat in the morning is a bit…

103
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:39,379
-Tough?
-Yes.

104
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,148
-But I want to see the menu.
-Okay.

105
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:43,016
<i>Here is the menu.</i>

106
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,786
<i>It looks like an American menu.</i>

107
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:47,921
<i>-Do menus look like this in the US?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

108
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:49,256
<i>It's packed with dishes.</i>

109
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,692
Excuse me.

110
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,493
Hey.

111
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,697
KIM LINUS
OWNER OF LINUS' BBQ

112
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,032
-Is he your bro?
-Yes, he is.

113
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:03,737
-Nice to meet you.
-Now she's your friend.

114
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,539
When did you open this place?

115
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:09,510
Oh, about 12 years ago…

116
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:10,744
We're on our 12th year.

117
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:13,814
-That's amazing.
-It's a long-standing place.

118
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:16,483
What's the most popular dish?

119
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,185
It's the Mega Platter.

120
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:19,720
THREE TYPES OF BBQ AND SIDES

121
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,723
-Is it bigger than that one?
-Yes, it has all of it.

122
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,258
-Even the fries?
-Of course.

123
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,894
We serve fries in a cart.

124
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,161
-Really?
-Yes.

125
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:29,630
-Fugly Nachos?
-Fugly Nachos.

126
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,398
We'll get the Fugly Nachos for you.

127
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:33,367
Two bourbon sweet teas and…

128
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,569
-Two lagers?
-Yes, two lagers.

129
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:37,838
Which lager is famous in the US?

130
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:40,507
-The bagpipe pilsner.
-Right.

131
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:42,910
Wow, I love pilsner.

132
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:44,978
SHE'S HILARIOUS

133
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:47,147
I can't wait for the delicious food.

134
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:48,849
I will do my best.

135
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:53,387
Not only is there American-style barbecue,
but there's also Korean-style.

136
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,488
Absolutely.

137
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:57,324
-Pork belly is Korean-style barbecue.
-Exactly.

138
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:59,092
-That's barbecue as well.
-Right.

139
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,595
But what's different
about the American-style?

140
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,064
<i>There's a gigantic smoking chamber.</i>

141
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:07,367
<i>They make a fire with firewood,</i>
<i>and the smoke rises.</i>

142
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:10,404
<i>They use the smoke and heat</i>

143
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,341
<i>to slowly cook the meat until it's tender.</i>

144
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:17,077
<i>-It's classic barbecue.</i>
<i>-I see.</i>

145
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:20,681
<i>I can't wait to try it.</i>

146
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,349
WHAT WILL IT TASTE LIKE?

147
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,484
I'm so hungry.

148
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,254
I worked out hard yesterday
and didn't eat breakfast today.

149
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:28,989
Hey, I also worked out yesterday.

150
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,658
My arms, back, and quads…

151
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:35,162
-It's the perfect day to eat meat.
-My body is worn out.

152
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,598
It's the perfect food
to prevent muscle loss.

153
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:38,699
You need protein.

154
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,901
-Look at that.
-It's here.

155
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:44,238
-Wait, this is…
-This is insane.

156
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:46,707
-It's just my kind of food.
-Thank you.

157
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,811
Wow, look at this. The kids would love it.

158
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:52,846
UNBELIEVABLE SPREAD

159
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:56,350
<i>-It looks amazing.</i>
<i>-Whoa, I can't believe this.</i>

160
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,918
THREE TYPES OF BARBECUE

161
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:02,956
We cook it very low, very slow
because, to get it juicy…

162
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,491
Sounds awesome.

163
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:06,426
These are the sides.

164
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:09,630
<i>This is our smoked chicken. Take a look.</i>

165
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:11,098
<i>We have two kinds of coleslaw.</i>

166
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,833
<i>The original refreshing coleslaw</i>

167
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,968
<i>and the mayonnaise coleslaw.</i>

168
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:16,904
<i>-The more common type in Korea.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

169
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,605
<i>These are handmade sausages.</i>

170
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:22,109
<i>These are hard taco chips.</i>

171
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:23,310
<i>Oh, they're hard.</i>

172
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:27,848
<i>These are slider buns on the side.</i>

173
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,218
-Where shall I put the beer?
-Over here, please.

174
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:32,452
BEER IS READY

175
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,987
-Wow, this is…
-Thank you.

176
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:35,556
THE BOURBON SWEET TEA IS HERE

177
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,425
-David, is there whiskey in this?
-Yes, it's bourbon.

178
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:40,894
<i>It's made with bourbon and peach iced tea.</i>

179
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,729
CARAMEL-FLAVORED BOURBON

180
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,399
AND PEACH-FLAVORED ICED TEA ARE MIXED

181
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,367
<i>Thank you for the food.</i>

182
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:48,502
<i>-Thank you.</i>
<i>-Enjoy.</i>

183
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:50,904
-Let's begin.
-How do we eat this?

184
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,006
-Tell us which cuts…
-Tell us how…

185
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:55,375
Let me tell you what these are.

186
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:57,744
<i>This is called brisket.</i>

187
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,313
<i>And this is pulled pork.</i>

188
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,582
<i>-It's pork neck.</i>
<i>-It's pulled into pieces.</i>

189
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,084
<i>And this is baby back rib.</i>
<i>It's pork spareribs.</i>

190
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,019
<i>We usually have that grilled with salt.</i>

191
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:09,323
But they put sauce on the spareribs
and smoked it.

192
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:11,725
<i>-It's cooked in a different way.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

193
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:19,533
JIHYO CAREFULLY TRIES THE BABY BACK RIB

194
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,840
It melts on my tongue.

195
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:31,078
-The cartilage on the bone just melts…
-Yes, it dissolves.

196
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:33,480
It just falls off the bone.

197
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:36,984
TIME TO DIG INTO THE BABY BACK RIBS

198
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,355
Wow, Namno, this is…

199
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:43,690
This is the best.

200
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:46,560
It doesn't taste like this
when cooked in an oven.

201
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:50,797
It completely tenderizes
all of the tissues,

202
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,534
<i>muscles, and fat on the meat.</i>

203
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,068
<i>-With the heat?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

204
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,005
The meat is totally different here.

205
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:00,607
-The texture is different.
-And the scent.

206
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:03,076
The sauce is spicy and tasty.

207
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:04,978
<i>They keep coating it.</i>

208
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:06,880
<i>With this sauce?</i>

209
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:10,117
<i>It boosts the fragrance and taste.</i>

210
00:09:10,184 --> 00:09:11,518
DEEPENS THE WHOLE FLAVOR

211
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:13,487
<i>I get why children love this.</i>

212
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:16,023
THE MORE YOU EAT THEM,
THE MORE ADDICTIVE THEY ARE

213
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,192
Wow, I'm obsessed with this.

214
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:19,393
CAN'T BELIEVE THIS

215
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:22,596
It's hard to find something like this
in our country.

216
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:25,832
<i>-David, is this pork?</i>
<i>-Yes, it's pork neck.</i>

217
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,734
TIME FOR PULLED PORK

218
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,475
YUM

219
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,010
Wow, it smells awesome.

220
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,147
Man, it's smokier
than I thought it would be.

221
00:09:40,214 --> 00:09:43,817
I'm loving this smoky wood flavor.

222
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:48,222
It's like pork
that's been steamed until tender.

223
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,124
-And torn into pieces.
-Right.

224
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:52,860
Like pork <i>jangjorim.</i>

225
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:58,565
When I was filming in Jeju Island,
I ate something called <i>momguk.</i>

226
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:01,168
<i>-That's so yummy. I love it.</i>
<i>-Really?</i>

227
00:10:01,235 --> 00:10:03,770
JEJU ISLAND'S SOUP
MADE WITH PORK BROTH AND GULFWEED

228
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:06,139
<i>When they make it,</i>

229
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:09,042
<i>they boil the pork until it's very tender.</i>

230
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,712
<i>They pull the meat apart by hand.</i>

231
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,780
IT'S TENDER ENOUGH
TO SHRED WITH YOUR HANDS

232
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:18,085
<i>This pulled pork feels like that.</i>
<i>It just goes down easily.</i>

233
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:24,124
THE TENDER TEXTURE IS SIMILAR
TO THE PORK IN <i>MOMGUK</i>

234
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:26,026
TAKES ONE MORE BITE

235
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:28,662
I thought you said
you don't eat meat in the morning.

236
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:30,097
WELL, THAT IS…

237
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,965
I lied.

238
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:36,236
Just kidding.

239
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,072
-Wait a second.
-You have sauce…

240
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:42,876
-Why do I keep getting food on my mouth?
-It means the food is good.

241
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:45,345
I'll help protect the actress's dignity.

242
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:46,413
It's okay.

243
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,849
Let's tell her at the end.
She'll keep making a mess.

244
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:53,487
<i>This is tasty. Try it.</i>

245
00:10:53,554 --> 00:10:56,089
TIME FOR A PIECE OF BRISKET

246
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:00,961
EATS IT IN ONE BITE

247
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:03,997
It's super tender.

248
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:08,402
NAMNO ALSO TAKES A BITE

249
00:11:10,571 --> 00:11:12,172
THIS IS THE STUFF

250
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:13,507
Wow, this is great.

251
00:11:13,574 --> 00:11:14,875
-Isn't it yummy?
-Yes.

252
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:17,644
<i>-David, did they apply a rub?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

253
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:20,581
<i>The fragrance is very unique.</i>

254
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:25,452
SMOKES THE BRISKET FOR OVER 16 HOURS

255
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,489
IT CARAMELIZES
INTO A DARK, CRISPY OUTER LAYER

256
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:34,228
WHAT DOES THE INSIDE
OF THE BLACK BRISKET LOOK LIKE?

257
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:38,065
OVERFLOWING WITH MEAT JUICE
AS SOON AS YOU CUT INTO IT

258
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:43,136
It's perfectly seasoned.

259
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,138
-I'm craving alcohol.
-Me too.

260
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,542
Jihyo, thank you for coming today.

261
00:11:48,609 --> 00:11:50,077
Please enjoy the food.

262
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,512
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

263
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:57,784
DANG, IT'S GOOD

264
00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:01,388
A SIP OF BOURBON SWEET TEA AS WELL

265
00:12:02,256 --> 00:12:03,957
-Isn't it good?
-Yes.

266
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:07,728
<i>Drinks that go down easy are dangerous.</i>
<i>You can't stop drinking.</i>

267
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,632
You've tried all three meats.
What do you think?

268
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:13,267
-Aren't they all different?
-Yes.

269
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,937
The baby back ribs have a strong sauce.

270
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:18,572
A SPICY AND SWEET SAUCE

271
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,940
<i>And the others…</i>

272
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:22,276
<i>-They're light.</i>
<i>-…maintained the natural flavors.</i>

273
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:25,712
ENJOYING THE NATURAL FLAVORS
OF BRISKET AND PULLED PORK

274
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:30,450
Not only is it a great meal,
but it's even better with drinks.

275
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:33,754
JIHYO TRIES SOMETHING

276
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,821
WOW

277
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,425
Please try this one. It's excellent.

278
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:41,495
WHAT IS IT?

279
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:43,797
<i>-The sausage?</i>
<i>-Yes, it's so good.</i>

280
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:46,033
THEY MADE THESE THEMSELVES

281
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:48,902
They taste very unique.

282
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:50,804
It's super light.

283
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:56,944
AT A LOSS FOR WORDS

284
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,412
These are unbelievable.

285
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:00,180
-They're tasty.
-So good.

286
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:05,219
Usually, there's an aftertaste
after eating sausages.

287
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,388
<i>-But this doesn't have that at all.</i>
<i>-It just tastes like meat.</i>

288
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:13,427
When it starts to taste overly greasy,
this coleslaw balances it out.

289
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:14,962
TRIES THE REFRESHING COLESLAW

290
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:20,200
DUJUN TRIES IT AS WELL

291
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,136
-I'm loving this.
-It's yummy.

292
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:25,939
<i>The white one tastes</i>
<i>like the usual kind we eat.</i>

293
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:27,641
<i>And the pink one is very unique.</i>

294
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:31,778
<i>This is the Southern-style one.</i>
<i>It's made with vinegar.</i>

295
00:13:32,346 --> 00:13:34,181
<i>I prefer this one. It's tangy.</i>

296
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:37,618
I should try the taco chips.

297
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:39,653
-Oh, me too.
-The hard taco chips?

298
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,790
I'll add some chicken to this.

299
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:46,026
ADDS SMOKED CHICKEN

300
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:48,395
This is <i>pico de gallo.</i>

301
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,698
-What? <i>Ppikku?</i>
-It's called <i>pico de gallo.</i>

302
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,168
"What? Ppikku?"

303
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:55,702
<i>Pico de gallo.</i>

304
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:57,638
<i>-Pico de gallo?</i>
-Yes.

305
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:01,375
It's a tomato salsa that's
typically served with Mexican tacos.

306
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,377
MEXICAN-STYLE SALSA WITH TOMATO AND ONION

307
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:06,280
And drizzle a bit of spicy sauce on top.

308
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,716
DRIZZLES BARBECUE SAUCE, AND IT'S READY

309
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:12,886
Tortilla.

310
00:14:13,754 --> 00:14:17,224
WHAT WILL JIHYO'S TACO TASTE LIKE?

311
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:20,794
Wow, this is the perfect beer snack.

312
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,629
I'm totally craving beer.

313
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,399
-Right?
-You're a true meat lover.

314
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:27,201
You are an expert in meat dishes.

315
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:28,569
MY FRIEND IS A MEAT GANGSTER

316
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:33,106
Jihyo, you're drinking it with a straw.

317
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:36,877
It kind of looks
like you're drinking lemonade.

318
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:38,545
-I can't believe it's beer.
-Wait.

319
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:40,581
IT'S ACTUALLY BEER

320
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:42,049
Surprisingly, it's beer.

321
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,550
FINISHED A GLASS

322
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:45,252
Excuse me.

323
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:48,188
Can I please have another glass?
Thank you.

324
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:49,389
-One more beer?
-Yes.

325
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:52,292
-Yes, one more beer.
-Just one more.

326
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:54,494
You speak English well.

327
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,331
It's fine as long as they understand you.

328
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,867
That's what I think. It's all good.

329
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:02,703
I heard you started a business.
Tell us about it.

330
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:05,038
I started a lingerie business.

331
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:06,807
-It's a fashion business.
-I see.

332
00:15:06,874 --> 00:15:07,908
It's trendy.

333
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:10,210
<i>It's my own brand,</i>

334
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:13,447
<i>and I design the lingerie myself.</i>

335
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:17,818
-I heard it's really comfortable.
-Wait.

336
00:15:17,885 --> 00:15:21,722
HOW DOES HE KNOW THAT?

337
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:23,590
-My wife got it as a gift.
-My goodness.

338
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:26,226
HIS WIFE WAS GIFTED

339
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:27,394
"I wore it today."

340
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:31,031
I didn't see that coming.
Your wife said so.

341
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:32,099
ALMOST MISUNDERSTOOD

342
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:36,503
Jihyo gifted my wife tons of the lingerie,
and she said that it was so comfortable.

343
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,438
-I'm glad she likes it.
-And it's pretty.

344
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:43,377
I've always loved fashion
and creating things.

345
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,779
-I see.
-So, I started my own business.

346
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:47,848
Didn't you attend
the film festival recently?

347
00:15:47,915 --> 00:15:50,684
Yes, I attended
the Jeonju International Film Festival.

348
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:52,986
-That's amazing.
-You're so busy.

349
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:55,923
What do you do in your free time?

350
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,357
I drink.

351
00:15:58,292 --> 00:15:59,960
-What's wrong?
-I love that.

352
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:02,329
GRADUALLY FALLING
FOR HER EASYGOING PERSONALITY

353
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:04,898
These are great dishes
to share while chatting.

354
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:07,935
I think we could chat all night
over these dishes.

355
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:09,469
We can eat it as it is.

356
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:12,773
But there's another way
that kids enjoy this.

357
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,043
They grab a piece of sweet cornbread

358
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:19,079
and add the ingredients
and sauce that they like.

359
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:20,414
MAKE A BURGER WITH THE BUN

360
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,548
Make your own burger.

361
00:16:21,615 --> 00:16:22,616
SOUNDS FUN

362
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,652
Wow, look at Namno.

363
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:28,455
I applied different sauces to each side.

364
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:31,658
Spicy sauce on one side
and sweet chili on the other.

365
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,527
And some pulled pork.

366
00:16:33,594 --> 00:16:35,229
PLENTY OF PULLED PORK

367
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,030
What was the name again?

368
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:38,866
<i>Pico de gallo. </i>It's tomato salsa.

369
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:41,969
<i>And some brisket.</i>

370
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:43,670
ADDS BRISKET ON TOP

371
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:45,239
He added two kinds of meat.

372
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:47,074
-Yes.
-It looks good.

373
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,509
He sure did.

374
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:53,547
Actually, it's common to add pulled pork
onto the bun and eat it.

375
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:56,550
People usually eat it sloppily like that.

376
00:16:56,617 --> 00:16:58,852
But I thought it would be better
with brisket.

377
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,554
BRISKET ADDS TO THE RICH FLAVOR

378
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:02,589
TOPS IT WITH COLESLAW

379
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:04,858
-He's adding everything.
-My gosh.

380
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:06,460
This is a classic burger.

381
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:07,928
-Really?
-Yes.

382
00:17:07,995 --> 00:17:10,764
I've seen something like this
at a handmade burger joint.

383
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:13,333
You just need a skewer in the middle.

384
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,402
We don't need a skewer here.
I just need to…

385
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:16,970
Press it down.

386
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,639
Then the sauce drips out.

387
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,475
Don't we see that a lot in commercials?

388
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:23,644
-Drenched in the sauce.
-Absolutely.

389
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:26,847
TRYING IT RIGHT AWAY

390
00:17:26,914 --> 00:17:29,116
-Wow, look at him.
-He's loving it.

391
00:17:29,183 --> 00:17:31,118
Man, that's insane.

392
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:32,786
You see…

393
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,890
-I feel energized, you know?
-Absolutely.

394
00:17:36,957 --> 00:17:39,159
I'm recharged. I feel pumped.

395
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,295
Let me make one, too.

396
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:45,132
-You're adding chicken.
-Yes, I am.

397
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:49,570
I didn't stack the meat.
I spread it out in one layer.

398
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,007
I'm going to make another one,
so I'm not going to put the top bun on.

399
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,375
That's a good strategy.

400
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:58,145
And add the sauce.

401
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:02,249
TAKES A BITE

402
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:06,653
YUM

403
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,122
Is it good?

404
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:10,691
Absolutely. Very good.

405
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,025
"Very good."

406
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,794
-The bun is delicious.
-I agree.

407
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:15,095
-It sure is.
-It's sweet.

408
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:17,397
-The bread…
-It's cornbread.

409
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:18,899
It's nutty.

410
00:18:18,966 --> 00:18:20,968
Do you make this with butter?

411
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:25,639
<i>There's butter in there,</i>
<i>but the main ingredient is corn.</i>

412
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:28,308
<i>-I'm obsessed with this.</i>
<i>-It's golden and sweet.</i>

413
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:30,344
Cheers.

414
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,612
CHEERS TO THE TASTY BUN

415
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:35,516
I'm amazed that I'm eating meat
this early, and that I'm also drinking.

416
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:36,683
Of course.

417
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,785
-Day drinking is the best.
-It's the best.

418
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:41,755
Jihyo is incredible.

419
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:47,294
CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THE PERFECT
COMBINATION OF BEER AND BARBECUE

420
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:50,130
-Oh, yay!
-He's speaking English again.

421
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:52,199
-Dessert.
-Wow, dessert?

422
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:54,034
-Dessert?
-It's in a cart.

423
00:18:54,101 --> 00:18:57,070
Wow, very heavy dessert.

424
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:58,205
WHAT'S THE NEXT DISH?

425
00:18:58,272 --> 00:19:00,807
-Wow, thank you.
-Gosh, this is my favorite.

426
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:05,579
These are Fugly Nachos and the Fries Cart.

427
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:06,947
FRIES CART

428
00:19:07,014 --> 00:19:09,583
People literally come here
just for the onion rings.

429
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,385
Really? Is it that good?

430
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:13,220
<i>I always order onion rings twice.</i>

431
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:15,455
<i>-It's good.</i>
<i>-Yes, these are our onion rings.</i>

432
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:18,592
-This is also interesting.
-What is it?

433
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:21,728
<i>It's deep-fried mac and cheese balls.</i>

434
00:19:22,196 --> 00:19:25,465
-Mac and cheese?
-Yes, it's filled with it.

435
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:28,702
There's jalapeño and bacon inside.

436
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:30,404
It's good for blood circulation.

437
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:33,240
-You will feel pumped.
-Definitely.

438
00:19:33,307 --> 00:19:35,709
The last one is deep-fried pickles.

439
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:38,011
-I've never seen this.
-Deep-fried pickles.

440
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:39,913
<i>-This is popular in the US.</i>
<i>-Really?</i>

441
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,149
<i>Yes, it's famous in the South.</i>

442
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:45,686
THOROUGHLY COAT THE DILL PICKLES IN BATTER

443
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:52,359
DEEP-FRY IT WHOLE

444
00:19:52,426 --> 00:19:55,295
Pickles are very moist…

445
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:56,630
-Right.
-It's very…

446
00:19:57,231 --> 00:20:00,868
It's very moist.
Is it okay to deep-fry it?

447
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:02,069
-It's okay.
-Really?

448
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:05,539
-We let it dry a bit.
-Oh, I see.

449
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:06,673
I'm curious.

450
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,776
<i>-This is our white sauce.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

451
00:20:09,843 --> 00:20:12,112
WHITE SAUCE MADE
WITH VINEGAR AND MAYONNAISE

452
00:20:12,813 --> 00:20:15,215
-Grab a pickle.
-Okay.

453
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,653
Let me take one and try it.

454
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:23,724
HALF EXCITED, HALF WORRIED

455
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,925
I've never had this.

456
00:20:24,992 --> 00:20:28,929
-We think that pickles are too wet.
-Right.

457
00:20:28,996 --> 00:20:32,099
It's like wondering how people
make deep-fried ice cream.

458
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:33,300
Exactly.

459
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,235
It's a delicacy.

460
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:41,909
Wait, it's very sour.

461
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:45,546
This is like pickled vegetables in Korea.

462
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:48,549
-They are also sour like this.
-Right.

463
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:50,450
They're a lot better when cooked.

464
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:53,420
-Is it like when we grill kimchi?
-Absolutely.

465
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:57,624
THEY ARE FULL OF FLAVOR
AFTER BEING DEEP-FRIED

466
00:20:57,691 --> 00:21:01,895
<i>I see how pickles and deep-frying</i>
<i>really complement each other.</i>

467
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,400
Let's try the onion rings that you like.
Dang, it's sour.

468
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:10,070
-I love onions, especially raw ones.
-Onions are tasty.

469
00:21:13,974 --> 00:21:16,143
-Gosh, this is hot.
-Be careful.

470
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:18,745
Look at this.

471
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,350
-The onions are very fresh.
-I agree.

472
00:21:24,151 --> 00:21:26,486
-It's still crunchy.
-It sure is.

473
00:21:26,553 --> 00:21:28,088
<i>Once I take a bite…</i>

474
00:21:28,155 --> 00:21:30,090
<i>-The juice comes out.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>

475
00:21:30,724 --> 00:21:31,725
<i>This is fantastic.</i>

476
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:37,564
The outside is crispy,
while the inside is very juicy.

477
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,766
-I agree.
-It goes well with the sauce.

478
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,702
IT PAIRS WELL WITH THE SAUCE

479
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:45,606
Isn't it hard to make it this good?

480
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:50,677
People think that deep-fried vegetables
are easy to make.

481
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:53,547
But actually, it's harder
to deep-fry veggies than meat.

482
00:21:54,248 --> 00:21:55,716
<i>-It's hard.</i>
<i>-It cooks too fast.</i>

483
00:21:55,782 --> 00:21:58,085
<i>The timing is important</i>
<i>to bring out the texture.</i>

484
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,620
REQUIRES EXPERT SKILLS

485
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:02,322
WHAT'S NEXT?

486
00:22:02,756 --> 00:22:06,927
NAMNO TRIES THE DEEP-FRIED
MAC AND CHEESE BALLS

487
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:08,395
This is the stuff.

488
00:22:08,462 --> 00:22:11,498
The owner has a unique style of cooking.

489
00:22:11,565 --> 00:22:13,500
Yes, it's so American.

490
00:22:14,301 --> 00:22:17,704
<i>It's the kind of food that hits the spot</i>
<i>when you're starving.</i>

491
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:19,106
PACKED WITH MAC AND CHEESE

492
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:21,041
It looks hot.

493
00:22:21,108 --> 00:22:24,745
TAKES A CAREFUL BITE THIS TIME

494
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:28,882
-You know fried rice.
-Of course.

495
00:22:28,949 --> 00:22:33,887
It's like packing it with fried rice
and taking a huge bite.

496
00:22:33,954 --> 00:22:35,455
I get what you're saying.

497
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:38,225
<i>-It's like eating delicious rice balls.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>

498
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:44,398
It feels really satisfying
when you take a full bite.

499
00:22:45,232 --> 00:22:47,000
A WHOLE NEW WORLD OF FLAVORS

500
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:49,903
-Wow, this is…
-She's really digging in.

501
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,739
It's because the food is amazing.

502
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:54,141
I'm glad you like it.

503
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,410
David, you're a real chef.

504
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:58,512
HAPPY THAT HER FRIEND IS A CHEF

505
00:22:58,579 --> 00:23:02,616
<i>I feel like I don't need to eat</i>
<i>anything else after this hearty meal.</i>

506
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:07,588
<i>There are various kinds of foods,</i>
<i>so it's very satisfying.</i>

507
00:23:07,654 --> 00:23:10,858
Like I said before…

508
00:23:10,924 --> 00:23:12,359
IS THERE MORE?

509
00:23:12,426 --> 00:23:14,995
-Since Jihyo is here…
-You prepared something for me?

510
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:16,063
-For her?
-Yes.

511
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:17,931
-For me?
-Is it not on the menu?

512
00:23:17,998 --> 00:23:19,466
-No, it's not.
-That's cool.

513
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:21,401
He's such an amazing friend.

514
00:23:21,835 --> 00:23:23,070
WOW

515
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,072
-Whoa, what is it?
-My goodness.

516
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:26,306
-What is it?
-My goodness.

517
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,675
<i>Happy birth-- </i>I'm just kidding.

518
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:31,778
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

519
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:34,147
Wow, what is this? It's a fire.

520
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:36,083
-It's hot.
-It's barbecue.

521
00:23:37,451 --> 00:23:38,552
What the menu?

522
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:41,021
-Wait, what did I just say?
-"What the menu."

523
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:44,191
Our volcano ribs are served
on special occasions.

524
00:23:44,258 --> 00:23:46,527
-What cut of meat is this?
-Baby back ribs.

525
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:47,995
Yes, baby back ribs.

526
00:23:48,061 --> 00:23:50,197
<i>-Like spareribs?</i>
<i>-It's rolled in a circle.</i>

527
00:23:50,264 --> 00:23:51,532
<i>That's right.</i>

528
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:55,969
<i>We form it into shape while prepping it.</i>

529
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,239
<i>-Do you grill it like this?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

530
00:23:59,306 --> 00:24:00,641
SMOKES IT AS IT IS

531
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,345
THE VOLCANO IS READY

532
00:24:06,046 --> 00:24:07,147
<i>I'm picturing dinosaurs.</i>

533
00:24:07,214 --> 00:24:09,950
<i>And it's like a birthday cake</i>
<i>if you put candles on it.</i>

534
00:24:10,017 --> 00:24:11,351
<i>That's right.</i>

535
00:24:12,286 --> 00:24:13,820
-Is that whiskey?
-Oh, my.

536
00:24:15,756 --> 00:24:17,191
My gosh.

537
00:24:17,257 --> 00:24:19,927
-Is this a dish for Jihyo?
-Yes.

538
00:24:19,993 --> 00:24:22,129
-Wow, thank you.
-This is insane.

539
00:24:22,196 --> 00:24:23,330
It's amazing.

540
00:24:23,397 --> 00:24:25,332
We don't usually grill veggies,

541
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:28,168
but my friend here helped us out.

542
00:24:28,235 --> 00:24:29,970
This is Chef Zach.

543
00:24:30,037 --> 00:24:32,072
-Thank you so much.
-You're very welcome.

544
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:34,808
DEEPLY MOVED

545
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:36,877
Dang, this is awesome.

546
00:24:37,778 --> 00:24:44,017
VEGGIES ARE GRILLED OVER CHARCOAL FIRE

547
00:24:44,952 --> 00:24:48,021
VARIOUS VEGGIES ARE COOKED OVER THE GRILL

548
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:57,030
PACKED WITH SMOKY FLAVOR, READY TO ENJOY

549
00:24:57,097 --> 00:25:01,835
This is our special elote,
made with our own recipe.

550
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:05,939
<i>-And this is zucchini.</i>
<i>-Got it.</i>

551
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:08,342
<i>These are matsutake mushrooms with garlic.</i>

552
00:25:08,876 --> 00:25:11,278
<i>And napa cabbage.</i>

553
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:13,680
JIHYO LOVES NAPA CABBAGE

554
00:25:13,747 --> 00:25:15,082
I love napa cabbage.

555
00:25:16,617 --> 00:25:19,019
-Do they debone it for us?
-That's incredible.

556
00:25:19,086 --> 00:25:20,854
DEBONES THE VOLCANO RIBS FOR THEM

557
00:25:20,921 --> 00:25:24,091
-Let's try the veggies while we wait.
-Sure.

558
00:25:24,157 --> 00:25:25,526
-Sounds good.
-Let's dig in.

559
00:25:25,893 --> 00:25:27,661
Oh, I love this.

560
00:25:27,728 --> 00:25:28,729
Help yourselves.

561
00:25:28,795 --> 00:25:30,230
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

562
00:25:30,297 --> 00:25:32,399
<i>Napa cabbage is my favorite.</i>

563
00:25:32,466 --> 00:25:33,534
EXCITED TO TRY IT

564
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,135
Why do you love this so much?

565
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:36,803
I'm not sure.

566
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,340
Maybe because I've eaten so many
napa cabbage pancakes and other dishes.

567
00:25:40,407 --> 00:25:42,075
-I see.
-I just love it.

568
00:25:42,142 --> 00:25:44,545
I could eat this all day.

569
00:25:45,145 --> 00:25:46,480
THE NAPA CABBAGE IS WARM

570
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:48,582
-It's very hot.
-Be careful.

571
00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:50,784
Oh, it's tangy.

572
00:25:50,851 --> 00:25:52,019
DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO BE

573
00:25:52,085 --> 00:25:54,621
-Is it tangy?
-Yes, there's lemon.

574
00:25:55,255 --> 00:25:56,623
This sour flavor…

575
00:25:57,024 --> 00:26:00,160
-Did they intentionally make it sour?
-Yes, it comes from the sauce.

576
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,996
<i>SALSA VERDE:</i>
SPANISH-STYLE SAUCE MADE WITH HERBS

577
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:04,831
<i>It enhances the overall flavor.</i>

578
00:26:05,933 --> 00:26:06,934
<i>This is great.</i>

579
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,137
THE SAUCE ADDS A SPECIAL TOUCH
TO THE GRILLED VEGGIES

580
00:26:10,204 --> 00:26:13,340
The napa cabbage goes well
with tangy sauce since it's sweet.

581
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:16,710
-In Japan, they dip it in ponzu sauce.
-Exactly.

582
00:26:16,777 --> 00:26:17,945
It's similar to that.

583
00:26:18,011 --> 00:26:21,615
Hearing the chefs talk about the food
makes it taste even better.

584
00:26:21,682 --> 00:26:22,683
FLATTERED

585
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,992
TRYING THE OTHER VEGETABLES AS WELL

586
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:33,060
YUM

587
00:26:34,328 --> 00:26:36,496
It's extremely sweet.

588
00:26:36,563 --> 00:26:38,966
<i>It maximizes the sweetness</i>
<i>of the vegetables.</i>

589
00:26:39,032 --> 00:26:40,434
GRILLING ENHANCES SWEETNESS

590
00:26:40,868 --> 00:26:42,636
The veggies are perfectly grilled.

591
00:26:44,505 --> 00:26:48,709
-Do you like grilled eggplant?
-Of course. I love it.

592
00:26:55,382 --> 00:26:57,818
-Everything is nice and sweet.
-It's good.

593
00:26:57,885 --> 00:26:59,253
-Is it sweet?
-Yes.

594
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,821
<i>I love it.</i>

595
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:04,892
-How is the corn?
-It'd be perfect on a cold day.

596
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:06,426
DAVID TAKES A BITE OF CORN

597
00:27:09,763 --> 00:27:14,168
It's so crispy.
It feels like tortilla chips are on top.

598
00:27:14,234 --> 00:27:16,370
-Is it that crispy?
-Absolutely.

599
00:27:20,107 --> 00:27:22,075
<i>It'd be nice to have this on the menu.</i>

600
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:24,611
<i>I think the vegetarians will love this.</i>

601
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:31,251
ALMOST DONE DEBONING THE VOLCANO RIBS

602
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:33,954
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

603
00:27:34,021 --> 00:27:35,455
Thank you very much.

604
00:27:35,522 --> 00:27:36,690
ALL DONE

605
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:39,626
Wow, it's so juicy.

606
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:42,529
I can tell it's perfectly cooked.

607
00:27:44,865 --> 00:27:46,133
This is unbelievable.

608
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,569
THE MOUTH FILLS WITH THE SMOKY FLAVOR

609
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,138
Isn't it scrumptious?

610
00:27:51,205 --> 00:27:55,175
NEVER-ENDING BARBECUE

611
00:27:55,976 --> 00:27:58,946
-Dujun, let's come here again.
-I'm so down.

612
00:28:00,414 --> 00:28:01,415
<i>It's yummy.</i>

613
00:28:01,481 --> 00:28:02,549
FILLED WITH JOY

614
00:28:02,616 --> 00:28:04,418
<i>I'm over the moon.</i>

615
00:28:06,286 --> 00:28:10,123
I'm delighted to see
everyone loving the food I recommended.

616
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,926
Hey, you did a fantastic job today.

617
00:28:12,993 --> 00:28:15,996
You should've invited me
to this place sooner.

618
00:28:16,663 --> 00:28:18,732
-You're here right now.
-I'm so happy.

619
00:28:19,433 --> 00:28:21,401
-Invite me again.
-Okay.

620
00:28:21,468 --> 00:28:23,437
I heard this episode airs on Christmas.

621
00:28:24,771 --> 00:28:27,574
-This is the perfect spread for Christmas.
-Definitely.

622
00:28:27,641 --> 00:28:29,243
<i>It's great for a year-end party.</i>

623
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:32,212
TODAY'S MENU IS PERFECT
FOR A YEAR-END CELEBRATION

624
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:35,449
-This is the perfect spot for a proposal.
-Oh, sure.

625
00:28:35,516 --> 00:28:40,220
-With a rib in your hand?
-Put the ring inside the volcano.

626
00:28:40,287 --> 00:28:46,693
HIDE THE ENGAGEMENT RING INSIDE

627
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,061
While cutting it…

628
00:28:48,128 --> 00:28:49,129
SURPRISE

629
00:28:49,196 --> 00:28:50,197
Isn't it amazing?

630
00:28:50,797 --> 00:28:54,001
I would be overjoyed
if a guy like that existed.

631
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:55,736
That's <i>The Lord of the Rings.</i>

632
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,171
HILARIOUS

633
00:28:57,237 --> 00:28:58,272
That's a bit tacky.

634
00:28:58,939 --> 00:29:00,174
Their humor matches…

635
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,242
<i>-The Lord of the Rings?</i>
-Yes.

636
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:03,577
<i>That was hilarious.</i>

637
00:29:03,644 --> 00:29:06,213
THE PERFECT PLACE TO EAT AND LAUGH

638
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,447
It was a great meal.

639
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:12,619
-Thank you for such a lovely time.
-Don't mention it.

640
00:29:12,686 --> 00:29:15,155
-It was also nice seeing you again.
-You too.

641
00:29:15,222 --> 00:29:18,025
-It was a pleasure to meet Namno.
-It was nice to meet you.

642
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:19,593
I had so much fun.

643
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:24,031
This go-to spot is like a longtime friend.

644
00:29:25,365 --> 00:29:29,136
<i>I missed Korea when I was in New York.</i>

645
00:29:29,203 --> 00:29:32,773
<i>I didn't think I would miss New York</i>
<i>after moving to Korea.</i>

646
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,443
<i>But I missed it because I spent</i>
<i>so much time there.</i>

647
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:42,049
This place really brings back
so many old memories.

648
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:44,618
So, it's like meeting an old friend.

649
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:48,322
Thank you for the wonderful meal.

650
00:29:48,388 --> 00:29:50,224
-Jihyo, thanks for coming.
-Anytime.

651
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,992
-Let's toast.
-Sure.

652
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:53,293
Happy New Year.

653
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,562
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.
