TODAY'S FOODIE BROTHERS:
THE FOURTH, YOON DUJUN

2
00:00:04,238 --> 00:00:07,040
THE YOUNGEST, YOON NAMNO

3
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:10,010
THE ELDEST, KIM MINSEONG

4
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:14,014
-Hello, everyone.
-Hi.

5
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:17,651
-We're at the Gangnam-gu Office Station.
-That's right.

6
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:22,656
<i>There are lots of offices here,</i>
<i>so people are always coming and going.</i>

7
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:26,126
I've worked here in Cheongdam-dong
and Gangnam-gu Office areas,

8
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,128
so I'm very familiar with this area.

9
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,964
This place is notorious
in the restaurant business.

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,966
-Why is that?
-It's like the major league.

11
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,602
-There are many veterans here.
-Got it.

12
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:38,071
-Many classics.
-It's hard to start a restaurant.

13
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:41,875
We should call out today's guest.
Who invited this chef?

14
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,945
Oh, I asked this chef to come.

15
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:46,613
He's got three characteristics.

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,918
First, he is known for his <i>aglio e olio,</i>
which we are familiar with.

17
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:54,421
-I think he makes the best in the country.
-Really?

18
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:58,559
<i>There may be many Italian cuisine chefs,</i>
<i>but his dishes are a bit more special.</i>

19
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:02,529
Second, he has an excellent
understanding of flavor.

20
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:03,597
What does that mean?

21
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:05,766
Don't all chefs have
a great sense of taste?

22
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:08,335
But he's quite exceptional.

23
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,137
His food is like a work of art.

24
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:14,608
<i>-He's really smart when it comes to that.</i>
<i>-I guess he transforms it into art.</i>

25
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:18,779
Third, he's known for shaping people
into better individuals.

26
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:21,281
He helps them become better chefs.

27
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:22,416
-You've matured.
-Yes.

28
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,585
-Were you among them?
-He's one of them.

29
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:27,521
-Well, you could say that.
-He's the outcome.

30
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,690
In the past, I was terrified of him.

31
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,959
-Really?
-Absolutely.

32
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:34,294
I couldn't look at him
for more than a second.

33
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:35,495
-Seriously?
-Yes.

34
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:36,563
Here he comes.

35
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,898
HE HAS ARRIVED

36
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:38,966
Hello.

37
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,334
NAMNO SALUTES RIGHT AWAY

38
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:42,970
Nice to meet you.

39
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,438
THE CHEF RETURNS THE SALUTE

40
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:46,673
It's our way of saying hi.

41
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,141
-At ease.
-Yes, sir.

42
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,477
TODAY'S CHEF
HIDDEN GENIUS, KIM TAESUNG

43
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:52,112
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

44
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:59,353
THE CHEF WITH AN ARTISTIC TOUCH

45
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:03,790
HE RUNS A FAMOUS ITALIAN RESTAURANT

46
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:08,262
CHEF KIM TAESUNG IS
WELL-KNOWN FOR ITALIAN CUISINE

47
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:12,699
THEY MET WHEN TAESUNG WAS A SOUS CHEF
AND NAMNO WAS A ROOKIE

48
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,770
Namno seems cautious around you.
How do you know each other?

49
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:20,007
I've scolded him a lot in the past.

50
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:21,875
Why are you sweating so much?

51
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:24,378
-I've never been this nervous.
-I know.

52
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:27,014
This brings back old memories.

53
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,215
Shall we get going?

54
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:29,783
-Yes, it's getting hot.
-Let's go.

55
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,085
-Lead the way.
-Let's go this way.

56
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,521
Do you come to this area often?

57
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:37,257
-My restaurant is nearby.
-I see.

58
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,660
I even moved here
to be closer to my restaurant.

59
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:43,564
Where is our go-to place?

60
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,432
-Is it around here?
-Yes, it is.

61
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:49,770
Chefs working in Gangnam-gu
should definitely know this place.

62
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:52,372
-Is it a spot they can't miss?
-Yes, it's relaxing.

63
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,107
It's a comfortable spot to eat.

64
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,310
-Is it like a local eatery?
-Yes.

65
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,712
-Do they sell alcohol?
-Yes, that's the key.

66
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:01,348
If it doesn't stay open late, we can't go.

67
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:03,517
-Exactly.
-You can go only after you close.

68
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:05,552
-Right.
-That's when you have your meal.

69
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:06,720
You can only go late.

70
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,290
If you look across the street,
there's a food alley.

71
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,860
-There's a <i>sundae </i>place.
-They sell huge <i>sundae.</i>

72
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,362
They look like long-standing restaurants.

73
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:18,765
<i>It's crowded</i>
<i>with office workers at lunchtime.</i>

74
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:20,868
<i>-There are a lot.</i>
<i>-Even in the evening.</i>

75
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,570
<i>-They've got great restaurants and bars.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>

76
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:25,506
<i>They're all long-established spots.</i>

77
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:26,573
MAJOR LEAGUE OF DINING

78
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:30,010
-Where shall we go?
-We're turning at this corner.

79
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:33,847
-Look at that.
-Is this the place?

80
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:37,417
-It's the first M*chelin spot on our show.
-Let's head inside.

81
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:38,752
It's our first time.

82
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,788
-Let's go inside first.
-It's a prominent go-to spot.

83
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,057
Today's spot is in front of us.

84
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,093
-Famous Place.
-"Famous Place"?

85
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,494
-Yes.
-They sell chicken soup.

86
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,531
But it's not this place.
This is the annex.

87
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,065
We have to go further.

88
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,869
This way. Let's head further inside.

89
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:57,738
This must be it.

90
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,773
It might seem like
a M*chelin-starred restaurant.

91
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,342
-You're right. What is this?
-It's the place next door.

92
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,778
-But this place is still top-tier.
-Absolutely.

93
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:07,047
It's a go-to spot for top-tier chefs.

94
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:09,917
<i>-A lot of top-tier chefs come here.</i>
<i>-It's an indoor snack bar.</i>

95
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,319
-It's a three-star place to us.
-Of course.

96
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:14,421
TO CHEF TAESUNG,
THIS IS A THREE-STAR PLACE

97
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:19,393
<i>-It seems cozy.</i>
<i>-Yes, it's a very cozy old-school eatery.</i>

98
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,261
<i>What shall we order here?</i>

99
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:23,830
Spicy braised chicken. It's a must-have.

100
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,266
How long has this place been here?

101
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:30,037
It hasn't been long since I found it.
It's only been two years.

102
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,207
One day, I told a nearby cafe owner
that I was eating here.

103
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,375
He'd been coming here since high school.

104
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:38,078
-It's been open for around for 40 years.
-40?

105
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:42,482
I come here very often.
Sometimes, I even come twice a week.

106
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:47,154
It's a great place for chefs
to come after work.

107
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:49,990
-What time does it close?
-It's open until 4:00 a.m.

108
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:52,793
Chefs usually get off work
around midnight.

109
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,429
It's my first time coming
at this time of day.

110
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,496
That's right.

111
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:58,565
-Welcome.
-Hi.

112
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:02,202
Thank you, sir.
I've never seen you at this time of day.

113
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:05,105
I've heard that lots of chefs come here
for work dinners.

114
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:06,340
Were you aware of that?

115
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,175
They get together here sometimes.

116
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:12,646
They come here to eat and naturally
run into other chefs they know.

117
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:14,581
-Yes.
-They end up sharing tables.

118
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:18,485
-Who have you bumped into?
-Let me see.

119
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:21,421
I've met Chef Song Haseulram
and Chef Bae Gyeongjun.

120
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:25,726
-Chefs in Gangnam-gu always come here.
-Probably because it's nearby.

121
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,428
I heard Chef Choi Hyunseok
has come here a few times.

122
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,930
We look forward to the food.

123
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,698
-Thank you.
-I'm starving.

124
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,768
We should still have a look at the menu.

125
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:37,905
<i>You should start</i>
<i>with spicy braised chicken.</i>

126
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:41,708
-The price is even affordable.
-It's a bargain in Gangnam.

127
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:43,911
Cheongyang pepper prawn pancake
sounds unique.

128
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:45,779
<i>That's one of my favorite dishes.</i>

129
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,748
<i>-Is it made with shrimp?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

130
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,883
We always order this when we come here.

131
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,285
-Let's order that, too.
-Sure.

132
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,487
Actually, I order this twice per meal.

133
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:57,824
I eat it at the start
and after finishing the main dish.

134
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,194
-Is it that good?
-Definitely.

135
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,528
This is why we're friends.

136
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:02,596
A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN

137
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:04,565
Spicy braised chicken and a pancake.

138
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:05,632
Sure.

139
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:10,237
What was your first impression of Namno?
He's adorable right now.

140
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:14,107
He used to be way cuter
when he was younger.

141
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:16,376
One thing that hasn't changed about him is

142
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:18,846
that he's a maniac.

143
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:19,980
That's the same.

144
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,349
-In many ways.
-That's right.

145
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:26,320
He was very passionate,
hard-working, and quick-witted, too.

146
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,955
He really loves to cook.

147
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,724
What was Chef Taesung like to you?

148
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,059
In the past…

149
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:34,895
He was terrifying.

150
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,831
He trained the other chefs intensively.

151
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:41,335
He already had six to seven years
of experience back then.

152
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,738
That's right.
I had been a chef for over six years.

153
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:51,144
When he trained the chefs under him,
he emphasized speed, accuracy,

154
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,881
and the head chef's style.

155
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:57,084
-He used to teach us these three points.
-I see.

156
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,420
-It's impossible for newbies to keep up.
-I bet.

157
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,523
We'd get in trouble if we cut wrong.

158
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:06,393
He had a certain look when he was furious.

159
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,495
It's his glasses.

160
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:10,831
My glasses would slide down.
It's hot in there.

161
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:12,399
Then I'd glare at them like this.

162
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:15,068
-My goodness.
-He was scared of that.

163
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:17,004
A GLARE THAT GAVE NAMNO PTSD

164
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,707
It's my first time meeting you,
and you suddenly look evil.

165
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,009
But I smile a lot now.

166
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,076
HE'S GENTLER NOW

167
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:26,213
I was nice to him,
but he only says bad things about me.

168
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,015
I'm just joking for the show.

169
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,816
USING THE SHOW TO EXPOSE HIM

170
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,718
THE FOOD IS FINALLY READY

171
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,688
-It's here.
-Gosh.

172
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,456
Thank you.

173
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:37,524
SPICY BRAISED CHICKEN

174
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:38,926
The portions are huge.

175
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:42,095
-What a sight.
-Man, it looks incredible.

176
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,765
A FANTASTIC, MOUTHWATERING IMAGE

177
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:50,270
THEIR SIGNATURE DISH,
SPICY BRAISED CHICKEN

178
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:53,841
This dish usually comes out
over a portable gas stove.

179
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,243
Is there a reason
you serve it completely cooked?

180
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,946
It usually needs
to be simmered for 20 minutes.

181
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:02,983
THE SPICY BRAISED CHICKEN HERE
IS SIMMERED FOR 20 MINUTES BEFORE SERVING

182
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,920
<i>-Otherwise, it wouldn't look like this.</i>
<i>-It burns after just a few more minutes.</i>

183
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:10,557
IT TENDS TO BURN QUICKLY IF OVERCOOKED

184
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:15,195
COOKING TO PERFECTION

185
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:20,667
<i>We want to serve it</i>
<i>at the point when it tastes the best.</i>

186
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:22,836
-You're serving the best version of it.
-Right.

187
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:25,172
I like the fact
that we can eat it right away.

188
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:27,841
What's in it? Potatoes…

189
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:31,712
-Chicken, chili, and chili powder.
-Green onions and onions.

190
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:33,780
Those are all the ingredients.

191
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:38,118
<i>-It thickens as the potatoes get mashed.</i>
<i>-From the potato starch.</i>

192
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:41,321
MINSEONG TAKES A SIP OF THE BROTH FIRST

193
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:44,958
How is the broth?
I've been dying to try it.

194
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,594
-It'd be awesome to mix it with rice.
-Exactly.

195
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:52,866
It's better than making fried rice.
You can simply mix it with rice.

196
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:56,370
-It's spicy, sweet, and salty.
-It sure is.

197
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:57,971
-It's also a bit tangy.
-Right.

198
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:01,041
It's perfect as a bar snack or a meal.

199
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:02,876
NOT TOO STRONG IN FLAVOR

200
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:05,812
-It isn't too spicy, either.
-It has a mild flavor.

201
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,015
NAMNO ALSO TAKES A BIG BITE

202
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,083
How is it?

203
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,986
-It doesn't taste heavy.
-Right.

204
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,189
It has gochujang,
but it has a clean finish.

205
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:16,256
It's tasty.

206
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:21,195
ADD THE THREE-DAY FERMENTED
GOCHUJANG SEASONING

207
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:27,134
<i>As the onions soften,</i>
<i>they release a sweet flavor.</i>

208
00:09:27,201 --> 00:09:29,102
<i>It's good because it's soft and sweet.</i>

209
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:34,241
SPICY BRAISED CHICKEN BROTH
OF THIS GO-TO SPOT

210
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:37,444
This spicy, sweet, and salty flavor
just coats your mouth.

211
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:41,014
It lingers pleasantly,
and it just cannot go wrong.

212
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:44,251
-This is amazing.
-It's especially scrumptious today.

213
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:45,619
I'm at a loss for words.

214
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:47,321
It tastes incredible.

215
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:48,856
CAN'T HELP BUT ADMIRE THE TASTE

216
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,558
You come here often,
but keep saying how good it is.

217
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,393
I even came here last Monday.

218
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,762
-I'm serious.
-Last week?

219
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:58,065
-You mean it when you say it's good.
-I mean it.

220
00:10:02,236 --> 00:10:04,938
-The sauce is perfectly balanced.
-That's right.

221
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,773
-It's not too sweet.
-I agree.

222
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,176
-It's not too salty.
-And it's not too spicy.

223
00:10:09,243 --> 00:10:12,880
-Every dish here is well-balanced.
-It's perfect.

224
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,815
This is what I like about this place.

225
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,417
Do you see this chicken breast?

226
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:20,354
-It goes well with the sauce.
-Exactly.

227
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,724
<i>It's not easy</i>
<i>for the two to go well together.</i>

228
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:29,796
If you eat chicken that isn't well-cooked,
it's bound to have an odor.

229
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:33,166
<i>But once it's cooked thoroughly…</i>

230
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:37,804
<i>-Does the gaminess disappear?</i>
<i>-Yes, absolutely.</i>

231
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:48,982
EVERYONE IS DEVOURING THE FOOD IN SILENCE

232
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,817
I'm loving this.

233
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:52,619
<i>It's a size-11 chicken.</i>

234
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:56,790
It's as big as a Korean native chicken,
so it's more chewy.

235
00:10:56,857 --> 00:11:00,527
It's guaranteed to be tasty
with this sauce.

236
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:01,862
How big is a size-11?

237
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:05,332
-It weighs 1.1 kilogram.
-Is it used to make fried chicken?

238
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,301
-No.
-They don't use size-11 chickens.

239
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:08,669
It's way bigger, right?

240
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:12,706
Size-seven or eight chickens are used
in two-for-one deals.

241
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:17,611
Even though you get two chickens,
they aren't as tasty as this big one.

242
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:21,181
<i>That's why the gochujang sauce</i>
<i>really complements this.</i>

243
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:23,350
<i>Small chickens don't have much meat.</i>

244
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:26,019
If the sauce is too strong,
you can't taste the chicken.

245
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:29,957
-Because it absorbs too much sauce.
-Yes. This is the perfect-sized chicken.

246
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,593
A BALANCE OF CHICKEN
AND A SPICY, SWEET, AND SALTY SAUCE

247
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:34,795
-It goes well with the sauce.
-Right.

248
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,897
-It's great with rice, too.
-Dig in.

249
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:40,267
-Help yourself.
-This is tasty.

250
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:42,002
It's so good.

251
00:11:46,607 --> 00:11:47,674
The potatoes are huge.

252
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:48,742
THEY ARE HUMONGOUS

253
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,448
GOSH, IT'S GIGANTIC

254
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:56,550
They have boxes of extra-large potatoes.

255
00:11:56,617 --> 00:11:58,018
-They do?
-They're jumbo-sized.

256
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:03,991
CAREFULLY SELECTED LARGE POTATOES

257
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:11,298
NICELY COOKED IN THE SAUCE UNTIL SOAKED

258
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:17,437
HOW DO THE THOROUGHLY COOKED
JUMBO POTATOES TASTE?

259
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:18,639
Let's try the potato.

260
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:23,377
THE FOODIE BROTHERS TRY A BITE

261
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:26,980
SATISFIED

262
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:29,483
-The potatoes are unbelievable.
-Yes.

263
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,551
The sauce is tasty.

264
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,085
THE POTATOES ABSORBED THE SAUCE

265
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:36,123
<i>-There are plenty of potatoes.</i>
<i>-They're tasty because it's potato season.</i>

266
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:41,161
I don't usually eat potatoes.

267
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:42,629
-Me neither.
-Really?

268
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:46,533
I'm not big on carbs,
but these are a must.

269
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,335
I mash them in the sauce and eat them.

270
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:50,904
-It's like eating radish in braised fish.
-Exactly.

271
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:54,341
THE POTATOES HAVE ABSORBED THE SAUCE
LIKE THE RADISH IN BRAISED FISH

272
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,513
-Oh, my.
-This is great.

273
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:02,316
Come to think of it…

274
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:07,254
If this came on a portable gas stove,
it might've ended up all scorched.

275
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:09,857
-The potatoes would've burned.
-It's perfect this way.

276
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:12,159
Another good thing about that is…

277
00:13:12,226 --> 00:13:16,396
-Chefs work over flames all day.
-It's so much work.

278
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:20,033
-It's a hassle to cook, and it gets hot.
-It will feel like working.

279
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,671
We make wood fires and cook
with brick ovens, so I get hot after work.

280
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:28,075
-It's a pain to cook this in that state.
-It must be stressful.

281
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,676
That's why I love it here.

282
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:32,579
THE SPICY BRAISED CHICKEN IS COOKED
AND READY FOR CHEFS TO EAT

283
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,349
-I love it.
-It's terrific.

284
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:38,185
It's especially tasty today.
We eat the same things.

285
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:39,820
-We eat this often.
-All the time.

286
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:41,221
It tastes better than usual.

287
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:47,160
Now that we've had enough protein,
we need some carbs.

288
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:50,264
The owner makes something special
that's not on the menu

289
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,398
for regulars like me.

290
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:52,966
A HIDDEN MENU FOR REGULARS?

291
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:55,969
You have to try it.
You can only eat it when you're with me.

292
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:57,037
-Let's try it.
-Really?

293
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:01,308
-Sir, can you please make that for us?
-Sure.

294
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,410
<i>-I'm on it.</i>
<i>-Thank you.</i>

295
00:14:03,477 --> 00:14:04,912
WHAT'S THE SECRET DISH?

296
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:06,680
-The rice balls are here.
-What?

297
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:08,515
Thank you.

298
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:10,350
We can dip it…

299
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:12,719
Yes, we dip it in the sauce.

300
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:17,257
THE SECRET DISH IS RICE BALLS
WITH DRIED SEAWEED FLAKES

301
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:22,029
SPRINKLE SALTY DRIED SEAWEED FLAKES
ON COOKED RICE

302
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:26,400
MIX THEM TOGETHER
AND DRIZZLE SESAME OIL ON TOP

303
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:34,942
SHAPE THEM INTO BITE-SIZED PIECES

304
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:42,749
SPRINKLE MORE DRIED SEAWEED FLAKES
AND SESAME SEEDS ON TOP

305
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:45,452
THE RICE BALLS ARE READY FOR THE REGULARS

306
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,754
<i>-Look at all the dried seaweed flakes.</i>
<i>-Let's eat.</i>

307
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:49,823
If you won't eat this, you're not Korean.

308
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,892
It's like you betrayed your own country.

309
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:53,961
-Put it on the plate.
-Here we go.

310
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:56,730
PUT A RICE BALL ON THE PLATE

311
00:14:56,797 --> 00:14:59,066
Add some thickened broth to it.

312
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:01,301
POUR THE RICH BROTH ON TOP

313
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:05,506
-Slightly drizzle the broth on the rice.
-Like this.

314
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:09,042
WHAT DOES IT TASTE LIKE?

315
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:14,848
EXPRESSING HIS DELIGHT
WITH HIS BODY INSTEAD OF HIS WORDS

316
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:15,983
It's delicious.

317
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:18,385
This is the best.

318
00:15:20,888 --> 00:15:21,922
It's perfect.

319
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:24,591
-Try it with diced radish kimchi.
-Nailed it.

320
00:15:25,626 --> 00:15:28,295
He serves this for free,
even though it's not easy to make.

321
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:31,932
It's not on the menu,
so it's only for longtime customers.

322
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:33,700
You have to come twice a week.

323
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:36,436
What if the viewers order rice balls
after watching this?

324
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:39,540
They can order it
after coming here five times a week.

325
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:42,976
-Only after five days in a row.
-We can't just order this.

326
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:45,112
The owner knows if you're a regular.

327
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:48,248
You can't order it
when you've only been here one time.

328
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:49,583
He remembers everyone.

329
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:56,190
DEVOURING MORE CARBS

330
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,429
I think I said earlier
that I don't really eat carbs.

331
00:16:03,197 --> 00:16:04,865
But how can you resist this?

332
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:08,402
-Potatoes and rice are all carbs.
-Exactly.

333
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,637
-This is the stuff.
-My blood sugar might spike.

334
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:15,976
ONE MORE BITE SINCE IT'S YUMMY

335
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,813
It must be nice to come here
after a long day at work.

336
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,881
It's the best.

337
00:16:20,948 --> 00:16:23,684
Chefs come here
around 11:00 p.m. to midnight,

338
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,786
which is like 7:00 p.m.
for office workers.

339
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:27,921
-Yes, after work.
-It's around that time.

340
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:31,058
We tend to come here at a later time.

341
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:34,695
We eat past midnight.

342
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:39,166
It kind of feels like I'm stretching
one meal across two days.

343
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:43,303
I use that as an excuse,
so I keep gaining weight.

344
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:47,508
If you get drunk, you end up buying
ice cream from the convenience store.

345
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:49,810
It's hard to stay in this business
without that.

346
00:16:49,877 --> 00:16:52,613
-I agree.
-The beauty of being a cook

347
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:55,382
is when you get a late-night drink.

348
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:57,484
-Here's the pancake.
-Thanks.

349
00:16:57,551 --> 00:16:59,753
-My favorite.
-What's this?

350
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,489
-I've--
-This must be their key dish.

351
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:03,991
This is absolutely amazing.

352
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:07,361
CHEONGYANG PEPPER PRAWN PANCAKE

353
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:10,497
<i>-It smells incredible.</i>
<i>-Cheongyang pepper prawn pancake.</i>

354
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:12,032
CHEONGYANG PEPPER ON EGGS

355
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:15,035
The pancake looks fantastic.

356
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:16,770
It's the perfect snack for soju.

357
00:17:16,837 --> 00:17:21,408
There's this aroma that comes out
when you cook shrimp with eggs.

358
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:23,911
-This scent?
-Yes.

359
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:26,680
-It's just irresistible.
-It's totally different.

360
00:17:26,747 --> 00:17:28,715
<i>It smells great when it's freshly cooked.</i>

361
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:30,851
<i>The shrimp smells delicious.</i>

362
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:37,491
THIS PANCAKE SMELLS TOO GOOD TO RESIST

363
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:39,993
-You sound really excited.
-I'm loving it.

364
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,729
-"I'm loving it."
-"I'm loving it."

365
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:46,033
<i>-It looks excellent. Enjoy.</i>
<i>-Let's dive in.</i>

366
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,736
TAKING A BIG BITE

367
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:53,207
SATISFIED

368
00:17:53,841 --> 00:17:57,644
FALLING IN LOVE
WITH THE SMELL OF PRAWN AND EGGS

369
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,782
NODDING HELPLESSLY AT HOW GOOD IT IS

370
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,589
Since it's an egg coating,
it's not even greasy.

371
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,924
It's good.

372
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:16,163
<i>The Cheongyang peppers are the key.</i>
<i>It balances out the greasiness.</i>

373
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,165
Pancakes taste good, but they're greasy.

374
00:18:18,232 --> 00:18:21,034
But these Cheongyang peppers
wash away the greasiness.

375
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:22,703
That's why you order it twice.

376
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,138
-Definitely.
-You can just keep eating it.

377
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:28,775
I even think
of taking food to go after work.

378
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:32,779
It's made using whole shrimp.

379
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:35,949
It's so much work
to prep them and cut them in half.

380
00:18:36,016 --> 00:18:40,354
They are large peeled shrimp.
You cut them in half and spread them open.

381
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:44,458
HALVE THE PEELED SHRIMP
AND REMOVE THE VEIN

382
00:18:44,525 --> 00:18:46,193
<i>Coat them thoroughly in beaten eggs.</i>

383
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,895
DIP THEM COMPLETELY IN BEATEN EGGS

384
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:52,332
BEGIN FRYING THEM IN A PREHEATED PAN

385
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:54,268
<i>They're coated in layers of beaten eggs.</i>

386
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,270
COATING IT WITH BEATEN EGGS IS THE KEY

387
00:18:58,839 --> 00:18:59,840
Look at the filling.

388
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:03,210
You don't see layers of eggs on it.

389
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:05,812
The beaten eggs just seeped
all the way through.

390
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:09,316
You can't make this by adding layers
of eggs. You have to keep coating it.

391
00:19:09,383 --> 00:19:12,586
<i>If you don't do it that way,</i>
<i>it won't get this thick.</i>

392
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,254
THIS IS THE SECRET TO THIS DISH

393
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,690
-It's nice.
-I'm loving it.

394
00:19:16,757 --> 00:19:18,892
I've never eaten this fast here.

395
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,729
<i>Shall we order more</i>
<i>since this is a small portion?</i>

396
00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:25,065
Can we please get
another spicy braised chicken?

397
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,868
-One more serving, please.
-Thank you.

398
00:19:27,935 --> 00:19:31,138
-It's tasty.
-It's a blessing to have a place like this

399
00:19:31,205 --> 00:19:34,641
-near your place.
-You're right. It's on my way home.

400
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:41,281
I either stop by here on my way home
or call up my chef friends to meet here.

401
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:45,886
-People who know this place will come.
-When he says, "the chicken," they're in.

402
00:19:45,953 --> 00:19:48,088
Sometimes, my friends get here before me.

403
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,360
A PLACE NOT THAT FAR FROM HOME AND WORK

404
00:19:53,794 --> 00:19:57,264
HAVING FUN WITH GOOD FRIENDS
IN A NICE PLACE

405
00:19:57,698 --> 00:20:01,101
ENJOYING SPICY BRAISED CHICKEN
AT HIS GO-TO SPOT

406
00:20:01,435 --> 00:20:04,338
This place is fun
because lots of chefs come here.

407
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:08,108
Some of them are junior and rookie chefs.

408
00:20:08,175 --> 00:20:09,643
But what if you run into…

409
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:14,314
In a group of four,
one person will act as the observer.

410
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:17,384
-The snitch?
-Yes, he'll come here and peek inside.

411
00:20:17,451 --> 00:20:20,754
-And then he would--
-He informs the other chefs.

412
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:22,856
He'd say, "We shouldn't eat here today."

413
00:20:23,123 --> 00:20:26,860
One time, I came in here and left
because there were too many junior chefs.

414
00:20:26,927 --> 00:20:29,563
-Awkward.
-They might feel uncomfortable around us.

415
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,632
I find it hard to talk with them casually.

416
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:34,801
I can't let rumors spread
about me talking behind Namno's back.

417
00:20:34,868 --> 00:20:37,938
THAT'S HILARIOUS

418
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:43,377
<i>-We should start making food pairings.</i>
<i>-Sure.</i>

419
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:44,778
Let's start with Namno.

420
00:20:44,845 --> 00:20:45,946
NAMNO GOES FIRST

421
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,049
<i>Will you be using the pancake?</i>

422
00:20:49,116 --> 00:20:50,250
I'm mixing everything.

423
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:51,351
MIXING IT ALL IN

424
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:52,486
1. CUT THE PANCAKE

425
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:54,955
-Are you cutting it all up?
-Yes.

426
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:58,292
I recently tried eating pizza
with chopsticks.

427
00:20:58,358 --> 00:20:59,927
It wasn't too bad.

428
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:02,596
Try cutting it with scissors
and use a fork or chopsticks.

429
00:21:02,663 --> 00:21:05,632
-It's better than you think.
-It's convenient.

430
00:21:08,068 --> 00:21:10,437
That pairing can't go wrong.

431
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:12,172
Are you cutting these up?

432
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:13,240
2. ADD PICKLED RADISH

433
00:21:13,307 --> 00:21:15,809
I'm adding more flavor to the rice balls.

434
00:21:15,876 --> 00:21:21,515
Honestly, everything is delicious here,
so I just mixed them all together.

435
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:23,984
He's even adding the broth.

436
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:27,154
I would always eat chicken feet
with rice balls.

437
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,791
-It's my first time trying this.
-It looks incredible.

438
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:34,862
4. DRIZZLE SESAME OIL ON TOP,
AND IT'S READY!

439
00:21:34,928 --> 00:21:36,830
I might get pimples after eating this.

440
00:21:37,231 --> 00:21:38,799
CHUCKLING

441
00:21:39,032 --> 00:21:41,401
NAMNO SUDDENLY PICKS UP A PERILLA LEAF

442
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:44,104
-He's improvising now.
-He must've thought of it now.

443
00:21:44,171 --> 00:21:45,939
<i>-This wasn't planned.</i>
<i>-Definitely.</i>

444
00:21:46,006 --> 00:21:47,908
USES THE PERILLA LEAF UNDER THE PANCAKE

445
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:50,444
-But it looks tasty.
-This is to add some aroma.

446
00:21:50,511 --> 00:21:52,112
PAIRING WRAPPED IN PERILLA LEAF

447
00:21:53,013 --> 00:21:54,715
SO HOW IS IT?

448
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:56,683
It might taste new to you.

449
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:01,255
It's bound to taste good with the broth.
It's mixed with all the good stuff.

450
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:04,424
The pickled radish adds flavor, too.

451
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:08,996
If there weren't perilla leaves here,
you would've been in trouble.

452
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:10,063
I agree.

453
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:13,634
Just as you've seen him make it,
he mixed everything in.

454
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,005
<i>From shrimp, dried seaweed, sesame oil,</i>
<i>to pickled radish and a thick sauce.</i>

455
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:20,908
It might've been too heavy
without the perilla leaf.

456
00:22:20,974 --> 00:22:22,876
It boosted the fragrance.

457
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,112
Mixing everything is the best.

458
00:22:26,547 --> 00:22:29,116
-Mine is simple.
-It's cheese. That's a game-changer.

459
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:31,051
-In Japan…
-Where did he get that?

460
00:22:31,118 --> 00:22:36,123
If you go to Shin-Okubo in Japan,
the Korean Wave is well established there.

461
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,193
Famous dishes include
marinated crab and spicy braised chicken.

462
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:42,196
-Yes, they're super popular.
-They're a hit.

463
00:22:42,262 --> 00:22:44,298
The Japanese find them spicy.

464
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:47,868
This is too spicy for their taste,
so they add this to tone it down.

465
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:50,370
-Really?
-Spread it out.

466
00:22:50,437 --> 00:22:52,840
TOPPING THE SPICY BRAISED CHICKEN
WITH CHEESE

467
00:22:52,906 --> 00:22:54,675
<i>Lay it out evenly like a blanket.</i>

468
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:56,343
<i>-It's a cheese blanket.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>

469
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:00,514
-I bet it tastes good.
-My gosh, that's insane.

470
00:23:01,281 --> 00:23:03,584
-Could you melt the cheese?
-I'll heat it up.

471
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:06,153
-He seems a bit taken aback.
-He modified the dish.

472
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,623
-He might add it to the menu as a topping.
-That's possible.

473
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,526
A FEW MINUTES LATER

474
00:23:12,593 --> 00:23:13,727
EXCLAIMING

475
00:23:13,794 --> 00:23:15,963
-Here you go.
-This is unbelievable.

476
00:23:17,598 --> 00:23:20,000
-Namno, get lost.
-I think he just won.

477
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:22,169
-This is a Japanese style.
-That's right.

478
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:25,806
<i>This will tone down the spiciness</i>
<i>and bring out the umami.</i>

479
00:23:25,873 --> 00:23:28,175
Oil's not necessary.
The richness will come out.

480
00:23:29,676 --> 00:23:31,078
Nothing beats cheese.

481
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:32,946
-Time to eat.
-Let me try it first.

482
00:23:33,013 --> 00:23:35,916
WHAT DOES IT TASTE LIKE?

483
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:38,685
This is a great idea.

484
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,821
<i>No one wanted to try mine, but…</i>

485
00:23:40,888 --> 00:23:43,323
THE MELTED CHEESE
ON TOP OF THE SPICY BRAISED CHICKEN

486
00:23:43,657 --> 00:23:47,861
TIME TO EAT

487
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:59,840
Mozzarella would've also been nice,
but cheddar smells unique.

488
00:23:59,907 --> 00:24:02,409
<i>-Right.</i>
<i>-It's great with this spicy flavor.</i>

489
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,711
<i>Broth mixed with cheese.</i>

490
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:06,780
BROTH MIXED WITH CHEESE IS THE BEST

491
00:24:06,847 --> 00:24:07,881
<i>It's irresistible.</i>

492
00:24:08,749 --> 00:24:11,251
-I'm addicted to this.
-I can't stop eating.

493
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:15,255
LIKE RESTING IN THE SHADE ON A HOT DAY

494
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:19,059
AT A GO-TO SPOT, YOU CAN FIND SHELTER
WHENEVER YOU'RE BURNED OUT

495
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:23,463
<i>Honestly, Famous Place is</i>
<i>a kind of cozy place to me.</i>

496
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,666
I come here after work
to shake off the stress

497
00:24:25,732 --> 00:24:28,402
and have a hearty meal
before heading home.

498
00:24:29,002 --> 00:24:30,871
It's a comfortable place to relax.

499
00:24:30,938 --> 00:24:35,442
I can come here with other chefs, friends
that live nearby, and childhood friends.

500
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:39,813
It's a relaxing place for anyone.
That's what this place means to me.

501
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,284
-You find comfort here.
-It's where my troubles disappear,

502
00:24:44,351 --> 00:24:47,187
and where I feel better
after having a drink.

503
00:24:47,254 --> 00:24:50,090
-Thank you for bringing us here.
-No problem.

504
00:24:50,157 --> 00:24:55,062
THIS IS CHEF TAESUNG'S GO-TO SPOT
