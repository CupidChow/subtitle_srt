-Really?
-There are many firms here.

5
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,720
It's a hub for work dinners
with many barbecue restaurants.

6
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,522
-Here?
-Yes.

7
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:24,258
There aren't any
famous local foods here, right?

8
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:25,792
-Like any local dishes?
-Not at all.

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,161
-Just for office workers?
-There aren't places

10
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,864
with comfort food,
only for office workers and work dinners.

11
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:33,534
-That's the vibe.
-I'm excited about today's menu.

12
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,403
I'm ready to feast today.

WHAT FOOD WILL THEY EAT IN DANGSAN TODAY?

20
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,687
We should greet today's chef.

21
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:56,323
Who invited today's chef?

22
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,824
I did.

23
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,259
Is it someone you're close to?

24
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:00,894
I wouldn't say close.

25
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:03,230
-She's like my secret…
-What?

26
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:04,464
…older sister.

27
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,366
NOT CLOSE, BUT A SECRET OLDER SISTER?

28
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,101
Hold on.

29
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:09,903
But you only have three brothers.

30
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,806
-I know all your younger brothers.
-I really do have one.

31
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:15,108
-Really?
-She really is my secret big sister.

32
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:18,111
-How can you smile while telling a secret?
-I'm serious.

33
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:21,348
I can roughly guess who it is.

34
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:22,749
She's tough like a big sister.

35
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,785
-Who is it?
-I know.

36
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:25,986
Can you guess?

37
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:32,793
IT'S DRIZZLING ON THE STREETS OF DANGSAN

38
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:37,698
SOMEONE IS WALKING TOWARDS US FROM AFAR

39
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,800
-You've become so handsome.
-I have?

40
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:41,335
You lost too much weight.

41
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,170
Feed me lots of good food.

42
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:45,873
Wait, who is that?

43
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:48,609
-Hold on.
-Who is it?

44
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:53,814
WHO'S THAT UNDER THE UMBRELLA?

45
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,418
-I knew it!
-Hello.

46
00:01:58,485 --> 00:01:59,920
-Hello.
-She acts like a celebrity.

47
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:01,221
I wanted to act cool.

48
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,891
Why did you lift it? Hey, are you nuts?

49
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,527
-I want to smack you.
-She was supposed to make an entrance.

50
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:07,895
Gosh, you don't get it.

51
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:11,565
Her entrance is up to par
with Gang Dongwon and Lee Jungjae's.

52
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,268
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

53
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:15,569
I'm a Chinese cuisine chef.

54
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:16,637
JUNG JISUN
TODAY'S CHEF

55
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,138
Clap loudly.

56
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:19,239
Clap hard.

57
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,242
You will be sharing your go-to restaurant.

58
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,745
I get asked about that a lot.

59
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,613
-I usually don't tell anyone.
-Why not?

60
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,082
I just don't feel like I need to.

61
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,151
-Right.
-People have different tastes.

62
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:33,854
-They might go and not like it.
-Exactly.

63
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:37,558
-They may be disappointed.
-People have high expectations of chefs.

64
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:40,093
But it's different today.
You can look forward to it.

65
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,163
Whenever I recommend this place,
people like it.

66
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:45,432
-Okay.
-You can have high hopes.

67
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,735
So, where are you going?

68
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:51,338
-What does that mean?
-Which way should we go?

69
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:52,773
-Which way?
-Shall we get going?

70
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,008
Let's talk on our way there.

71
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:56,343
-Tell him what to say.
-Sure.

72
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,011
AWKWARD

73
00:02:58,078 --> 00:02:59,913
I've never heard that line before.

74
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,448
-Let's go this way.
-This way.

75
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,117
My bad.

76
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,185
HEADING TO HER GO-TO PLACE

77
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,888
-Is it close?
-Yes, it's just a short walk.

78
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:11,191
-It would've been great without the rain.
-Right.

79
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:16,096
Dujun really seems to stand out

80
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:18,365
-standing next to these two chefs.
-Really?

81
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:20,934
-You steal the spotlight.
-Sure.

82
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:22,069
You shine so bright.

83
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,705
-Are we…
-We're close.

84
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:26,607
I can see it.

85
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:29,743
Last time I came here…

86
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,411
-You came here?
-…there was a long line.

87
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:32,880
It's a super famous place.

88
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,215
-This place is good, too.
-It's famous.

89
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:36,450
It's opposite a famous place.

90
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:38,318
-Right.
-It's called Dangsan Hall?

91
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,255
-It has a unique name.
-Korean beef <i>gopchang.</i>

92
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,623
Let's go inside.

93
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:43,857
-Shall we go in?
-Yes.

94
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:45,893
Won't they be more friendly
if you go in first?

95
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,327
-No way.
-Definitely.

96
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,662
-Go in first.
-No, please.

97
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:49,930
How dare you go in first?

98
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:51,698
-So what?
-Stop and let Jisun go in first.

99
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,100
Stop it.

100
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,235
Jinseung!

101
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,271
It's been so long.

102
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,273
Bro, how have you been?

103
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:01,108
POLITELY CALLING HER A BRO

104
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:02,276
She's my bro.

105
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,944
-It's been a while.
-Hello.

106
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:06,380

00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:23,897
…the assorted dish first.

112
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:25,199
-The assorted dish?
-Yes.

113
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,467
-May I take your order?
-Should we have the assorted dish?

114
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:29,203
-All right.
-Bring that out.

115
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,938
-I'll bring four servings.

00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,974
-Give us plenty.

00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:38,078
ASSORTED <i>GOPCHANG </i>IS GRILLED

00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:07,407
-Oh, my.
-Goodness.

125
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:08,709
This is insane.

126
00:05:12,246 --> 00:05:13,413
-My goodness.
-Look.

127
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,481
Oh, dear.

130
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:19,653
A MOUTHWATERING SIGHT

131
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:21,255
My wife would love this.

132
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,322
TAKING PHOTOS

133
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:24,291
-This is insane.
-My mouth is watering.

134
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,897
It's only partially grilled,
so let it cook for a bit more.

135
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,468
WHEN THE OUTER SKIN OF THE <i>GOPCHANG</i>
IS SLIGHTLY BURNT AND CRISPY,

136
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:39,072
AND THE FATS IN THE <i>DAECHANG </i>BECOME JUICY,

137
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,278
THE ASSORTED PLATTER IS
FINALLY GRILLED JUST RIGHT

138
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,612
This is unbelievable.

139
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:48,916
Could you explain how you eat this?

140
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:50,817
-Since you're a regular.
-Right.

141
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:54,221
You see the sauces here.

142
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:55,322
-Sesame oil and salt.
-Yes.

143
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:57,424
And this is a special sauce.

144
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:59,359
-This one.
-It's a special sauce?

145
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:02,963
I take great pride
in wrapping it in perilla leaf.

146
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,332
-Perilla leaf?
-Every time.

147
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:14,842
CHEF JUNG JISUN'S SECRET:
WRAP IT IN PERILLA LEAF

148
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:18,145
Let's all try it with perilla leaf.

149
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,847
She likes it so much
that she's taking a lot.

150
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:23,417
-Isn't that too much perilla leaf?
-No, I have to eat this much.

151
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,552
-You eat that much perilla leaf?
-Yes.

152
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:28,622
You keep asking for more,
so they must have plenty.

153
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,457
Do we just wrap it and eat it?

154
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,327
Yes, it's a bit sour

155
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,797
with a savory aftertaste,
so I eat it this way.

156
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:44,238
THE FOODIE BROTHERS
FOLLOW CHEF JISUN'S LEAD

157
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:50,177
WHAT DO THE FOODIE BROTHERS THINK
OF THE PERILLA LEAF WRAP?

158
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,613
-It certainly balances out the greasiness.
-Yes.

159
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:56,016
-That way, you can have more <i>gopchang.</i>
-Absolutely.

160
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,519
-The fats taste amazing.
-I agree.

161
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,889
-It's rich in fat.
-Yes.

162
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:03,524
IT'S DELICIOUS AND RICH IN FAT

163
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:10,731
NEXT UP IS THE MILD AND CHEWY

165
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:19,273
Dip it in sesame oil and salt.

166
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,708
TRYING IT WITH SESAME OIL AND SALT!

167
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:22,776
It's so good.

168
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,681

HOW TO ENJOY <i>DAECHANG?</i>

171
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:37,925
Grill it nice and crisp until
it's crispy outside and juicy inside.

172
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,827
-Try it with perilla leaf as well.
-Okay.

173
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:42,930
You always eat it with perilla leaf.

174
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:44,565
It's delicious that way.

175
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:46,934
TASTY

176
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,369
She made it this far
by mastering only one thing.

177
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:51,138
She puts all her attention on it.

178
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:52,940
SHE SUCCEEDED THROUGH HER DEDICATION
ON ONE THING

179
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,042
You should become
the Queen of Perilla Leaf.

180
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:57,845
NOT THE QUEEN OF DIM SUM
BUT THE QUEEN OF PERILLA LEAF

181
00:07:57,945 --> 00:07:59,279
Isn't it too hot?

182
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:03,150
THE FOODIE BROTHERS TRY <i>DAECHANG</i>
AND PERILLA LEAF TOGETHER

183
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:07,988
WHAT DOES IT TASTE LIKE?

184
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,091
The <i>daechang </i>just melts in my mouth.

185
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,294
THE OILY <i>DAECHANG </i>JUST MELTS
WITH THE TANGY PERILLA LEAF

186
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:18,398
Doesn't eating <i>daechang</i>
make you crave something?

187
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,200
Definitely.

188
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:21,768
-Alcohol.
-I brought some.

189
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,070
REMINDS THEM OF ALCOHOL

190
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,137
Kaoliang liquor.

191
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:25,572
She always has

192
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:29,243
a bottle of Kinmen kaoliang liquor,
58% ABV, with her.

193
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,111
It's Taiwan's signature kaoliang liquor.

194
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:34,781
I've never imagined pairing <i>gopchang</i>
with kaoliang liquor.

195
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,350
Why did you bring this?

196
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:39,753
Chinese cuisines go well with this
because they're a bit greasy.

197
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,688
It balances out the greasiness.

198
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:44,191
And it pairs well with <i>gopchang…</i>

199
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:45,993
-Since it's oily.
-…so I eat them together.

200
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,327
-She only drinks this.
-Try it.

201
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:48,428
Thank you.

202
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:50,130
ACTIONS SPEAKS LOUDER THAN WORDS!
TAKE A SHOT

203
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,999
-Hold on.
-I'll fill it to the brim.

204
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:53,834
You have to drink it in one go.

205
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:55,502
In one go? I…

206
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:58,071
-Have you never tried this?
-Kaoliang liquor?

207
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:00,374
-I remember trying it.
-A glass of cola, please.

208
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,509
-Cola.
-Let me smell it.

209
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:04,611
It has a fresh and clear aroma.

210
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:06,713
It's my favorite scent.

211
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,916
You should never drink this with ice.

212
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:13,820
GLASSES ARE FILLED FOR EVERYONE

213
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:14,888
All right.

214
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:17,324
-Cheers.
-Thank you.

215
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:20,060
HOW IS THE KINMEN KAOLIANG LIQUOR,
58% ABV?

216
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,295
It's very sweet.

217
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:23,797
Gosh.

218
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:30,170
THIS IS GREAT

219
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:33,574
How could you leave some
when everyone finished?

220
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,741
-My bad.
-Come on.

221
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:36,443
SOMEHOW STARTLED

222
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:40,080
She always picks on me when we eat.

223
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,586
Despite looking like this,
he surprisingly likes wine.

224
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,856
-Hold on.
-I absolutely can't believe it.

225
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,157
-Right?
-I really don't

226
00:09:50,224 --> 00:09:51,825
-get that about him.
-Wait.

227
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:53,594
-And he only drinks Bordeaux.
-Right.

228
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,229
-It's insane.
-I have no words.

229
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:56,797
He looks like a soju guy.

230
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:58,632
-Do you only drink Bordeaux?
-Wait.

231
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,367
-He only likes Bordeaux.
-So?

232
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,569
-Does wine not suit me?
-It suits you.

233
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:04,071
-Right?
-He only drinks wine

234
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:06,907
-after making some money.
-Why are the staff laughing?

235
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:08,242
They all agree.

236
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:10,577
I like Pinot Noir.

237
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:12,412
-Pinot Noir?
-Yes.

238
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,615
-It doesn't suit you.
-Minseong.

239
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,518
-You're not drunk, are you?
-No.

240
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:19,586
I wish someone would film Taehoon's face.

241
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:22,222
He's red around his eyes.

242
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:26,293
WINE ALSO PAIRS WELL
WITH OUR DEAR CHEF LIM TAEHOON

243
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,594
Minseong, would you like more?

244
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:29,296
-There's not much left.
-Sure.

245
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:30,998
-I should've brought a bigger one.
-It's good.

246
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:35,202
LAST SHOT FOR EVERYONE

247
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:39,039
DOWNS THE EMPTY GLASS IN DISCONTENT

248
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:41,675
-It's quite unique.
-Doesn't it have a clean finish?

249
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:42,743
-Yes.
-Right?

250
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,979
The <i>gopchang </i>has been pushed aside
since we started drinking.

251
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:49,116
I didn't expect to drink on set.

252
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:53,754
I suppose Chef Taehoon and Chef Minseong
feel the pressure of hosting, right?

253
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,322
-Hosting?
-You were hosting?

254
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:57,324
I wasn't thinking about it at all.

255
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:59,793
You're supposed to be
the one that's hosting.

256
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:03,063
-We're eating, so don't ask us.
-I see.

257
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,233
-Can I talk casually?
-Of course.

258
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:12,072
Although we want to enjoy <i>gopchang,</i>
there aren't that many places to go.

259
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:15,042
Is it hard to supply it?

260
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:16,476
That's the main issue.

261
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:18,879
That's why it's hard
to run a <i>gopchang </i>place.

262
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,349
There are a lot of franchises,
but not many <i>gopchang </i>franchises.

263
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,417
There are some.

264
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:24,585
Where?

265
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:26,720
-Just directly operated stores.
-Not franchises.

266
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:30,757
Just a few directly operated stores,
but not hundreds like franchises.

267
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:34,027
They can't supply it,
so they have to import it.

268
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:37,731
The imported ones don't match
the Korean taste because they're bigger.

269
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:40,067
-He's an expert.
-He knows everything.

270
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,969
-Exactly.
-He's not a Japanese food chef.

271
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,338
Just a jack of all trades.

272
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,542
Get me something sharp, please.

273
00:11:48,609 --> 00:11:49,710
Something pointy.

274
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,545
Or sharpen the chopsticks.

275
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:52,913
I'm going to poke you with one.

276
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,214
JACK OF ALL TRADES STRIKES BACK

277
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:57,751
I don't usually eat
while drinking alcohol.

278
00:11:57,818 --> 00:11:59,119
But I kind of get

279
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:02,289
-why you pair them.
-Do you get it now?

280
00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:06,126
That's why you pair certain dishes
with different types of alcohol.

281
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:08,128
-They go well together.
-It's pairing.

282
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:11,164
You'll be done for.
You get totally hooked.

283
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:20,073
THE FOODIE BROTHERS ARE ENJOYING
ALCOHOL AND FOOD ON A RAINY DAY

284
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,377
AFTER SOME TIME,

285
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:27,881
THE ASSORTED PLATTER IS ALMOST GONE

286
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:33,820
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE TO EAT
WITH THE TASTY <i>GOPCHANG?</i>

287
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:37,157
After eating a platter,
I usually have <i>ramyeon.</i>

288
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:38,225
-Really?
-Yes.

289
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:40,060
-We should have some.
-It's so good.

290
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:41,461
-Jinseung!
-There's <i>ramyeon.</i>

291
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:42,996
Sir.

292
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:50,370
SPICY SOUP BOILED OVER HIGH HEAT,

293
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:57,244
MIXED TOGETHER WITH CHEWY NOODLES

294
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,217
-The <i>ramyeon </i>is here.
-Don't touch the pot. It's hot.

295
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:05,152
It's incredibly good.

296
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:07,254
It doesn't look like the typical <i>ramyeon.</i>

297
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:10,023
HOW DOES IT TASTE?

298
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,828
Oh, now this is <i>ramyeon.</i>

299
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,401
THE FAMILIAR TASTE OF <i>RAMYEON</i>

300
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,036
-It's a secret.
-I see.

301
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:24,505
-Yes.
-It's delicious.

302
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:26,139
It's very spicy.

303
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:27,674
I like it with <i>gopchang.</i>

304
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:29,009
Just one more bite.

305
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:33,680
-It balances out the greasiness.
-We can start all over.

306
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:35,182
MAKING ROOM FOR MORE <i>GOPCHANG</i>

307
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:36,783
We're almost done. Let's get one more.

308
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:37,951
-One more?
-Yes.

309
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:40,654
Minseong, what type
of <i>gopchang </i>do you like?

310
00:13:40,721 --> 00:13:42,856
I usually eat brisket.

311
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:44,491
-Brisket?
-Really?

312
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:46,994
HIS FAVORITE, GRILLED BEEF TRIPE
BEEF BRISKET POINT

313
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,596
Which part is that? The stomach?

314
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,532
It's called the beef brisket point.

315
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:53,967
It's the muscle that holds
the stomach and intestines.

316
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:57,538
This is what we call the brisket.

317
00:13:57,604 --> 00:13:58,805
It's a muscle.

318
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:01,508
But it's not found in Korean beef.

319
00:14:02,543 --> 00:14:03,744
-Not at all?
-None.

320
00:14:04,545 --> 00:14:07,447
The muscle starts to build up
after 30 months.

321
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,116
Then, there's enough muscle to eat.

322
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:10,984
But there is none, so we import it.

323
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:14,488
Cows in Korea are butchered
when they're a bit over 20 months.

324
00:14:14,555 --> 00:14:16,823
That's why Korean beef is the best.

325
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,426
He sounds like he owns a <i>gopchang </i>place,
not a Japanese restaurant.

326
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:22,563
He's a meat expert
when he cooks Japanese food.

327
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:25,065
NOT A JAPANESE CUISINE CHEF,
BUT A JACK OF ALL TRADES

328
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,502
ALONG WITH MINSEONG'S FAVORITE,
GRILLED BEEF TRIPE,

329
00:14:30,137 --> 00:14:33,440
THEY ORDERED MORE GRILLED <i>GOPCHANG</i>

330
00:14:37,611 --> 00:14:40,781
ONE MORE PLATTER OF <i>GOPCHANG</i>
AND GRILLED BEEF TRIPE COMING UP

331
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:45,886
The fire is nice here. Everything that is
cooked on a grill here looks good.

332
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,524
-Should I leave this here?
-Leave it there.

333
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:53,861
It looks awesome.

334
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:55,495
-Try the brisket.
-Go ahead.

335
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,030
-Try it even if you're full.
-This one?

336
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:59,566
-Do we eat this with perilla leaf?
-Yes.

337
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:01,268
-It's so soft.
-But wait.

338
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:02,669
These two are different.

339
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:05,272
This is usually very hard and chewy.

340
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:08,208
It's usually tough,
but this one is nice and chewy.

341
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:09,943
It's tender and chewy.

342
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,111
It's so tasty.

343
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:12,179
I'm loving this.

344
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:15,716
I want to give a toast.

345
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:17,951
-It's popular among millennials and Gen Z.
-Okay.

346
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,653
WHAT ON EARTH

347
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,355
IS HE TRYING TO DO?

348
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:25,759
Tung Tung Tung Tung Tung Tung Sahur!

349
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:29,196
-Hold on. I'm at a loss for words.
-What is this nonsense?

350
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:32,432
Tung Tung Tung Tung Tung Tung Sahur!

351
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:33,834
-What was that?
-You've never heard it?

352
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:35,202
I've never heard of it.

353
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:36,537
-Seriously.
-I've never heard of it.

354
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,206
-This is totally new to me.
-I've heard it a few times,

355
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:41,341
but I kept seeing this
in shorts and reels.

356
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:43,844
<i>Let toast to us!</i>

357
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:46,947
<i>-Tralalero Tralala!</i>
<i>-Tralalero Tralala!</i>

358
00:15:47,014 --> 00:15:49,683
<i>-Bombardiro Crocodilo.</i>
<i>-Bombardiro Crocodilo.</i>

359
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,487
<i>-Tung Tung Tung Tung Tung Tung Sahur.</i>
<i>-Tung Tung Tung Tung Tung Tung Sahur.</i>

360
00:15:53,554 --> 00:15:54,621
TOAST BY MILLENNIALS AND GEN Z

361
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:58,725
What is that?

362
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,695
-I love how you enjoy learning new things.
-He likes it.

363
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:03,163
I'm a very curious person.

364
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:08,001
I feel like Minseong will learn this
and do it on his YouTube channel.

365
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:10,470
HE'S GOING TO TRY THIS ON HIS CHANNEL?

366
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:12,039
He should certainly learn it.

367
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,442
Will you do it, too?

368
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:16,643
-No.
-Really?

369
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,413
I don't think she's that type.

370
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,281
-You're right.
-She isn't. But I am.

371
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:24,384
TAEHOON IS EXCITED TO PROPOSE
A GEN Z TOAST IN THE FUTURE

372
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:26,720
-Let me ask a question right now.
-Sure.

373
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:29,022
It's about food pairings.

374
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:33,794
Lots of people are curious
about how chefs pair different foods.

375
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:37,397
-A lot of people are curious about this.
-Food pairings.

376
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:41,969
Last time,
there was a penalty for the loser.

377
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:43,770
-What?
-Yes, there's one today, too.

378
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:44,838
-Today?
-Yes.

379
00:16:44,905 --> 00:16:49,042
The guest chef will choose a loser,
and there will be a penalty for him.

380
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:50,811
-Good luck.
-I'm serious.

381
00:16:50,878 --> 00:16:52,479
Make something I can eat.

382
00:16:52,546 --> 00:16:54,047
Of course, we will.

383
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:57,284
I usually cook the perilla leaves
on the grill.

384
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,086
-Really?
-Yes.

385
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:00,554
-You could do that.
-Yes.

386
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:01,755
Shall I try it?

387
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:02,823
First, we grill it.

388
00:17:02,923 --> 00:17:04,758
-Do you see this come up?
-Yes.

389
00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:07,227
-Take it out.
-Then, we eat it with the <i>gopchang?</i>

390
00:17:08,462 --> 00:17:11,198
-It smells more tangy.
-The aroma will get richer.

391
00:17:11,265 --> 00:17:12,332
IT TURNS SOUR WHEN GRILLED

392
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:14,201
-It tastes different, right?
-Yes.

393
00:17:14,268 --> 00:17:18,472
-And I really try to emphasize the sauce.
-I see.

394
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:19,706
Don't be surprised.

395
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:20,874
I'm curious.

396
00:17:20,941 --> 00:17:23,143
He's full of confidence.

397
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:26,046
-Is that soy sauce?
-Yes.

398
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:27,848
Soy sauce and wasabi?

399
00:17:27,915 --> 00:17:30,050
TAEHOON'S SAUCE

400
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:31,885
2. MIX VINEGAR WITH THE SPECIAL SAUCE

401
00:17:31,952 --> 00:17:34,655
3. ADD CHEONGYANG PEPPERS
AND CHOPPED GREEN ONIONS

402
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:35,856
Add soda.

403
00:17:35,923 --> 00:17:37,124
Soda?

404
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:38,659
-So random.
-That's my soda.

405
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,127
Just pour in a lot.

406
00:17:40,194 --> 00:17:42,029
No, we shouldn't add too much.

407
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:43,730
Let's see.

408
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:46,433
-What?
-Are you adding perilla leaf?

409
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:50,504
-It will overshadow it.
-Jisun, it won't.

410
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:52,739
He's grilling it first.

411
00:17:53,707 --> 00:17:55,175
This is a lot of work.

412
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:57,010
ADD GRILLED PERILLA LEAF TO THE SAUCE

413
00:17:58,212 --> 00:17:59,813
Just dip it in completely.

414
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,316
DIP THE <i>GOPCHANG </i>IN THE SAUCE

415
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:04,318
ON THE GRILLED PERILLA LEAF

416
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:05,686
Put it on the perilla leaf.

417
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:12,359
WHAT DOES IT TASTE LIKE?

418
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:19,833
CHEF JISUN LOOKS SERIOUS

419
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,068
Give them only one.

420
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:22,569
Just one? Is it salty?

421
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:24,304
-Yes, it's too salty.
-Is it?

422
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:30,777
I get why you said it was salty.

423
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:31,912
HEARTBROKEN

424
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:37,751
HE TRIES IT HIMSELF IN DISBELIEF

425
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,356
COUGH

426
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:44,191
Why did you cough right away?

427
00:18:44,258 --> 00:18:46,793
Look at Jisun. She's laughing.

428
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,664
Your big sister is disappointed.
She doesn't know what to do with you.

429
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:53,500
HIS CONFIDENCE AT THE START
IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN

430
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,170
FEELING BAD FOR TAEHOON

431
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:58,305
Share your secret with us, too.

432
00:18:58,372 --> 00:19:00,474
-I'm excited for yours.
-Me too.

433
00:19:01,275 --> 00:19:02,943
-Sir.
-Hold on.

434
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,445
-Can you make it right now?
-Absolutely.

435
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:07,581
Could you please get me
some <i>ssamjang </i>in a small bowl

436
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:09,049
-and a can of soda?
-Okay.

437
00:19:09,116 --> 00:19:11,118
I need more of it than I expected.

438
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,687
<i>Ssamjang? </i>Interesting.

439
00:19:14,922 --> 00:19:16,323
-What's this?
-Sesame seed.

440
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,725
-Pour the soda.
-No way!

441
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:20,694
-I'm in shock.
-What's in the soda?

442
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:22,496
-Sugar.
-Lime flavoring, lemon, sugar.

443
00:19:22,563 --> 00:19:23,830
It has everything in it.

444
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:28,068
This is the sauce
that will balance out the greasiness.

445
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:31,038
-We have chives here.
-Yes.

446
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:34,174
Place the chives on top of the rice,
using chopsticks.

447
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:38,011
<i>Daechang </i>has lots of good stuff inside.

448
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:40,113
3. ADD THE WELL-COOKED <i>GOPCHANG</i>
AND <i>DAECHANG </i>ON TOP

449
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,817
4. ADD GRILLED GARLIC
AND OTHER VEGGIES ON TOP

450
00:19:43,884 --> 00:19:45,986
-The sauce.
-Then pour the sauce here.

451
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:50,190
5. LIGHTLY DRIZZLE THE SAUCE MADE EARLIER

452
00:19:50,257 --> 00:19:52,993
6. LASTLY, ADD THE SLICED GREEN ONIONS
(OPTIONAL)

453
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,263
-Fried rice haters will enjoy this.
-It looks good.

454
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,764
It looks tasty.

455
00:19:58,966 --> 00:19:59,967
It's like eating <i>gyudon.</i>

456
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:05,506
LET ME TAKE A BITE

457
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:06,607
YUM

458
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,476
Like this.

459
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:10,577
All right.

460
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:17,751
CHEFS JISUN AND TAEHOON
HAVE A BITE AS WELL

461
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:20,387
The soda helps tone down the seasoning<i>.</i>

462
00:20:20,454 --> 00:20:22,723
-Yes, it becomes more tender.
-Exactly.

463
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:25,526
It is tasty.

464
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:27,294
-It sure is.
-I agree.

465
00:20:28,028 --> 00:20:29,062
But it's too sweet.

466
00:20:31,532 --> 00:20:32,533
It could be.

467
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,968
Should I go next?

468
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:37,137
-Didn't you already?
-You did.

469
00:20:37,204 --> 00:20:38,605
No, that was just for show.

470
00:20:38,672 --> 00:20:40,307
-Really?
-"For show."

471
00:20:40,374 --> 00:20:41,475
Before…

472
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:43,544
He anticipated his failure.

473
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,845
-He already knew it.
-Is that it?

474
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:46,914
He's trying to get another chance.

475
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,615
-Hold on…
-Attaboy, Taehoon.

476
00:20:55,956 --> 00:21:00,994
JINSEUNG CAN'T TAKE HIS EYES OFF THEM
WHILE THEY HOLD THE PAIRING CONTEST

477
00:21:02,863 --> 00:21:07,367
HE CAREFULLY TAKES OUT NEW INGREDIENTS
AND STIR-FRIES THEM

478
00:21:07,968 --> 00:21:09,403
-What's that?
-A new dish?

479
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:10,771
My gosh, thank you.

480
00:21:10,838 --> 00:21:12,506
This is nothing special.

481
00:21:12,573 --> 00:21:15,576
I saw our talented chefs
whip up some great food earlier.

482
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:19,246
I used to make Chinese food,
so I wanted to make something.

483
00:21:19,313 --> 00:21:21,715
-Oh, my, it's a stir-fry dish.
-Look at that.

484
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:26,453
I made some spicy <i>daechang.</i>

485
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,921
-It's a Chinese-style dish.
-Yes.

486
00:21:27,988 --> 00:21:30,090
Try it with green onions underneath.

487
00:21:31,825 --> 00:21:33,794
It smells like Jisun's dishes.

488
00:21:33,861 --> 00:21:35,095
-It's delicious.
-Yes.

489
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:38,999
-You stir-fried it well.
-Really? It's nice to get compliments.

490
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:41,134
You never cared.

491
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:43,670
You're right.

492
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:45,706
Do you know Master Yeo Kyungok?

493
00:21:46,507 --> 00:21:48,542
We both worked under him.

494
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:51,044
<i>-Weren't you there before me?</i>
<i>-Yes, I was.</i>

495
00:21:51,111 --> 00:21:53,547
<i>-Technically, you're my senior.</i>
<i>-Stop it.</i>

496
00:21:53,614 --> 00:21:56,049
<i>I was the youngest member when I started,</i>

497
00:21:56,116 --> 00:21:58,452
<i>-and she joined as an experienced cook.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

498
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:02,856
When I asked her to teach me something,

499
00:22:02,923 --> 00:22:05,592
she would complain
and act like she wouldn't.

500
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:07,094
But she taught me everything.

501
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:09,296
-She's tough but a softie.
-A softie.

502
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,098
-That sounds like her.
-Yes.

503
00:22:12,366 --> 00:22:15,569
THE TWO CONNECTED OVER CHINESE FOOD
AND KEPT THEIR FRIENDSHIP GOING

504
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:19,706
WISHING THEM A LASTING FRIENDSHIP

505
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:24,778
EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN STORY
BEHIND THEIR GO-TO RESTAURANT

506
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:30,117
WHAT DOES CHEF JUNG JISUN'S
GO-TO PLACE MEAN TO HER?

507
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:33,153
After I get off work at 11:00 p.m.,

508
00:22:33,987 --> 00:22:36,890
he prepares food and drinks
when I tell him I'm coming here.

509
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:40,194
-I do?
-It isn't necessarily <i>gopchang.</i>

510
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,863
We've ordered 20 kilograms of scallops
and grill them.

511
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:45,399
We've also made braised chicken.

512
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:48,068
I told him I would stop by after a shoot.

513
00:22:48,135 --> 00:22:49,870
He came and opened when he was at home.

514
00:22:49,937 --> 00:22:51,805
He lives in Gimpo,
and it takes him 40 minutes.

515
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:53,440
I was all prepared to leave.

516
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,176
I guess you two are really close.

517
00:22:56,243 --> 00:22:57,244
Of course.

518
00:22:57,311 --> 00:22:58,512
I love his food.

519
00:23:00,914 --> 00:23:05,352
IT'S ALWAYS HEARTWARMING HERE

520
00:23:07,688 --> 00:23:11,692
THIS IS CHEF JISUN'S GO-TO PLACE

521
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:19,967
How was it today?

522
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:22,436
-You introduced us to your go-to place.
-Oh, yes.

523
00:23:22,503 --> 00:23:24,605
This shoot was an excuse to come here.

524
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:27,975
I hadn't had this in a while,
and it was so delicious.

525
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:30,310
I loved sharing this place
with good people.

526
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:32,679
I hope it becomes more famous.

527
00:23:33,313 --> 00:23:34,414
The food was great.

528
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:36,683
You got me into beef <i>gopchang.</i>

529
00:23:37,518 --> 00:23:41,021
This is probably
the best <i>gopchang </i>there is, right?

530
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:44,224
This is top-quality <i>gopchang.</i>

531
00:23:45,158 --> 00:23:46,894
Chef Jung.

532
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,997
You also need to choose
a loser for the penalty.

533
00:23:50,063 --> 00:23:52,199
What penalty shall we give?

534
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:56,170
-How about walking all the way home?
-Sure.

535
00:23:56,236 --> 00:23:58,372
-All the way home?
-My house is far away.

536
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:01,808
-You live in Yeongdeungpo.
-I live in Yeouido.

537
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,210
-That's nearby.
-He lives in Seocho.

538
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:04,978
You're too cruel.

539
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:07,247
Then, how about walking 10,000 steps?

540
00:24:07,314 --> 00:24:09,616
You can't go home

541
00:24:09,683 --> 00:24:12,853
-until you walk 10,000 steps.
-Turn on the pedometer.

542
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,921
-Deal.
-Sure.

543
00:24:13,987 --> 00:24:14,988
Don't shake it.

544
00:24:15,055 --> 00:24:16,089
-So 10,000 steps.
-No way.

545
00:24:16,156 --> 00:24:18,225
But doesn't she get to choose?

546
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:19,560
-She will decide.
-Yes.

547
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:22,296
-Why are you looking at me?
-Everyone is talking to you.

548
00:24:22,362 --> 00:24:25,165
It seems like you're already
in last place.

549
00:24:25,232 --> 00:24:28,168
Just walk 10,000 steps for your health.

550
00:24:28,235 --> 00:24:30,671
TAEHOON WINS LAST PLACE FOR HIS HEALTH

551
00:24:30,737 --> 00:24:32,239
It's an affectionate punishment.

552
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:34,241
-Definitely.
-You're the best, Chef.

553
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:35,576
All right.

554
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:37,411
I lost this time.

555
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:39,646
-Okay.
-I guess I lost this one.

556
00:24:39,713 --> 00:24:43,050

Jeez, I have to leave my car
and walk home.

566
00:25:13,213 --> 00:25:16,116
It might have been okay
if it weren't raining.

567
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:19,653
YANGHWA BRIDGE, SEOUL

568
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,221
<i>It didn't take too long.</i>

569
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:24,525
<i>I'm almost at the end of Yanghwa Bridge.</i>

570
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:26,660
<i>Wait, is this broken?</i>

571
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,795
THE PEDOMETER BROKE

572
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:32,165
TAEHOON SUDDENLY STOPPED TALKING

573
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,134
My gosh!

574
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:35,335
HIS UMBRELLA BROKE FROM THE WIND

575
00:25:35,402 --> 00:25:38,906
URGENTLY FIXING HIS UMBRELLA

576
00:25:38,972 --> 00:25:40,641
-Did it just unfold?
-No.

INTERACTING WITH FANS AS WELL

587
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,097
One, two, three.

588
00:26:04,164 --> 00:26:06,333
Okay. One, two, three.

589
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,534
It's over.

590
00:26:08,268 --> 00:26:11,104
-It reads 5,624 steps.

591
