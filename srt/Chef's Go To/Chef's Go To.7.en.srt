00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:11,712
-Man, it's hot.
-Gosh, it's sweltering.

4
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:16,216
HEEBAB AND THE FOODIE BROTHERS
HAVE ARRIVED AT A FISH MARKET

5
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:20,821
We're right in the heart of Samcheonpo.

6
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:25,158
It smells like fish here.
There will be a lot of them over there.

7
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:31,231
We had amazing pork last week,
so I hope we get some seafood this week.

8
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:33,000
There's gizzard shad.

9
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,403
<i>Summer is the season for gizzard shad.</i>

10
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:39,106
There's a Gizzard Shad Festival in August.

11
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:41,808
-Oh, here?
-They hold it before fall comes.

12
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,545
-We think fall is the only time to eat it.
-Nope.

13
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:49,616
-It brings back a runaway daughter-in-law.
-Any daughter-in-law would return for it.

14
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:52,819
Runaway daughters-in-law
come home sooner in Samcheonpo.

15
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:56,390
-Hey, what's that?
-Look at that.

16
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:58,392
The 12 animals from the Chinese Zodiac.

17
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,761
They recreated <i>The Tale of the Turtle</i>
with seafood.

18
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:03,130
<i>-The Tale of the Turtle?</i>
-The seafood are…

19
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:06,967
Multeombeong is the name
of that cubed snailfish.

20
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:09,469
Himjangi is the eel, and Agu the monkfish.

21
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:11,905
-Jeoni the gizzard shad.
-And that's an octopus.

22
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:14,741
-I don't know who Halbae is.
-Halbae is the Dragon King.

23
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:16,343
Gamdungeo is the black sea bream.

24
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,078
The black sea bream.

25
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:21,048
-Kkumteulhae is the sea cucumber.
-The next one is an anchovy.

26
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:25,252
Ppollaegi is a rockfish,
and those two are filefish and stingray.

27
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:29,256
-It's like the Chinese Zodiac.
-It's like the 12 zodiac animals.

28
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:30,824
The 12 animals of the sea.

29
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:32,259
FISH MARKET

30
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:35,362
-Let's go in.
-This is Samcheonpo Yonggung Fish Market.

31
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:40,801
-They modernized the traditional market.
-Lead the way.

32
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:43,770
I heard that
it's the biggest market in the country.

33
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:46,006
-It's super clean.
-It's so long.

34
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:48,542
There's more around the corner at the end.

35
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,845
There's more? It's well-organized.
It's not like a maze.

36
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:54,781
-It's in a straight line.
-The sea breeze is so cool.

37
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:58,585
-The sea is right out front.
-How refreshing.

38
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:00,187
<i>It's nice.</i>

39
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:02,556
THE CLEAR SEA RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES!

40
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:06,059
FRESHLY CAUGHT SEAFOOD

41
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:10,197
-There are live fish over there.
-They've got shrimp, too.

42
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:11,899
There's sashimi.

43
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,669
The octopus fishing season has reopened,
so there's plenty of it now.

44
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:19,039
-Are these Manila clams?
-They're huge.

45
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:20,574
They're squirting water.

46
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,511
This is so cool.

47
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:27,247
-Hello.
-Hi.

48
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:32,052
-Do you have some <i>horaegi</i>?
-What's <i>horaegi?</i>

49
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:34,288
-We should have some.
-They're baby octopus.

50
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,522
-Baby octopus?
-There.

51
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:38,692
-Are they the small?
-Can we eat them now?

52
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:41,862
<i>We can eat them now</i>
<i>if they were freshly caught.</i>

53
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:45,532
-We could just dip them in <i>chojang.</i>
-I agree.

54
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,669
I WANT SOME

55
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,773
-Do you want a piece that's prepped?
-Yes, we'd love that, please.

56
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,076
-What?
-She asked if we'd like some prepped ones.

57
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:57,911
I told her we would like to try some.

58
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,379
Please give me one.

59
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:02,683
How many <i>horaegi </i>can Heebab eat?

60
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,552
-I can't eat that much sashimi.
-Really?

61
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,121
It looks so fresh.

62
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,892
You might eat a lot if you like it.

63
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,460
You try it.

64
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,463
SLURP

65
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,832
-It tastes better than in Seoul.
-I bet.

66
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:21,502
-What do you think?
-Isn't it good?

67
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,704
-It's sweet.
-How many should we buy?

68
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:28,976
HOW MANY BABY OCTOPUSES CAN SHE EAT?

69
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,112
A hundred?

70
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,381
She says one hundred.

71
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:38,352
I think some of the seafood
at today's go-to spot can be found here.

72
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,256
-I think I see some.
-Are we going to a sashimi restaurant?

73
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,425
-It's still a secret.
-I guess we're having seafood today.

74
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:48,629
-This one might be on the menu.
-Are we going to a sashimi restaurant?

75
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,097
-Is it rare in Seoul?
-Yes.

76
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:53,734
-Then it's worth visiting.
-They have it in Tongyeong and Masan.

77
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,937
Let's go.

78
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:58,372
SUPER CURIOUS TO FIND OUT!

79
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:02,075
I really want some gizzard shad.

80
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,444
<i>It's a three-minute walk from here.</i>

81
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:06,480
<i>-Really? It's nearby.</i>
<i>-It's around here.</i>

82
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:11,451
WHAT WILL TODAY'S GO-TO SPOT BE LIKE?

83
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,654
-Is it that place?
-We're here.

84
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,323
-"Silbi."
-Look at the name.

85
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,425
What's up with the name of this place?

86
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:20,494
"Vienna Hideout Silbi."

87
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:24,298
-It's like a sign for a coffeehouse.
-The name appears to have a backstory.

88
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,602
Has anyone ever been
to a place like this before?

89
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:29,970
It's my first time.

90
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:31,872
I'm so curious. It's my first time, too.

91
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:35,642
-Let's head inside.
-I can't wait.

92
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,180
-It doesn't look like a restaurant.
-I agree.

93
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:43,050
-Is this how I should open the door?
-It's like a karaoke bar.

94
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:44,852
<i>Hello.</i>

95
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:49,056
EMPTY TABLES

96
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,426
-Hello, Auntie.
-Welcome.

97
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,595
JUNG HAENGJA
RUNNING THIS SPOT FOR 25 YEARS

98
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,830
-Where should we sit?
-Are there four of you?

99
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:58,465
-Yes, should we sit here?
-Sure.

100
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:02,369
Why did you wear a mask today?
Show us your lovely face.

101
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,571
Why are you wearing a mask?

102
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:10,277
I told you you're beautiful.
You look absolutely amazing.

103
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:11,879
-Absolutely amazing.
-Amazing.

104
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:14,314
-It's so unique here.
-It sure is.

105
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:16,450
It feels cozy here.

106
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:22,523
<i>There are a total of eight tables</i>
<i>with more than 50 seats.</i>

107
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:23,690
It's packed at night.

108
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:27,361
-Really? Why isn't it packed today?
-Today, I asked for a favor.

109
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:33,800
Since this is my hometown, I asked her
if she could clear out the restaurant.

110
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:37,171
I asked her to close it down for us.
I booked the whole place.

111
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:40,707
-The whole place?
-That's why the owner said yes.

112
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:43,810
-How do we order?
-We pay per person.

113
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:48,315
It's 40,000 won per person.
Then it's 160,000 won for four people.

114
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:50,217
Each person gets two bottles of alcohol.

115
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:51,485
So, we get eight bottles?

116
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:54,121
-Including the alcohol?
-Yes, it's 40,000 won per person.

117
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,323
-Then it's very cheap.
-That's a bargain.

118
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,625
That's why this place is called <i>silbi.</i>

119
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:02,262
It means they only charge clients
for the actual cost of the ingredients.

120
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,398
-That's why it's called <i>silbi.</i>
-Cool.

121
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,466
-I didn't know.
-Like the <i>dazzi </i>in Tongyeong.

122
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,303
<i>-I've heard of that.</i>
<i>-They're famous.</i>

123
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,638
<i>This is common around here.</i>

124
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:15,509
There's <i>tongsuljip </i>in Masan
and <i>dazzi </i>in Tongyeong,

125
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:17,244
then we have <i>silbi </i>here in Sacheon.

126
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:20,848
-That's cool.
-So, we'll have various types of dishes.

127
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:25,118
-Are they all seasonal dishes?
-That's right.

128
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:27,421
It's up to the owner to decide.

129
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:32,426
-Auntie, we'd like a set for four people.
-It's easy to order this way.

130
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:37,898
I can't wait to try their food here
after seeing all the seafood earlier.

131
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:40,634
That was a good warm-up.

132
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:42,503
I'm really looking forward to it.

133
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:47,674
FRESH SEAFOOD SOURCED DAILY

134
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,981
SEASONAL DELICACIES PREPARED
WITH THE OWNER'S TOUCH

135
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,752
WHAT DISHES WILL SHE MAKE TODAY?

136
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:02,256
-It's here.
-Already?

137
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:09,730
-I love it.
-Abalones.

138
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:12,299
BRAISED ABALONE

139
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:13,800
It's parboiled octopus.

140
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,068
WATER KIMCHI, BEAN SPROUTS

141
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:16,870
-Conch.
-Octopus and conch.

142
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,705
PARBOILED OCTOPUS AND CONCH

143
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:21,208
-Enjoy.
-Do you have any small plates?

144
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:22,843
Yes, I'll get you some.

145
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:26,613
Was her voice always this friendly?

146
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,615
She sounds too nice today.

147
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:31,351
-Look at that.
-That is unbelievable.

148
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,253
Are we allowed to be served this much?

149
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,758
-What is all of this?
-Here, it's gizzard shad sashimi.

150
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,826
It's gizzard shad!

151
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,129
-I wanted some.
-Gizzard shad and <i>hamo.</i>

152
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:44,131
<i>Hamo </i>and gizzard shad.

153
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:46,099
CONGER EEL AND GIZZARD SHAD SASHIMI

154
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,001
-Gizzard shad and <i>hamo.</i>
-Is this <i>horaegi?</i>

155
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:51,839
-Yes, and this is a horned conch.
-Horned conch and sea squirt.

156
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,307
This is <i>jijim, </i>my favorite.

157
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:55,509
KOREAN MINT CHIVE PANCAKE

158
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:58,512
-Is this steamed ray?
-Is it not seasoned spicy?

159
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:01,381
-It's cooked with soybean paste.
-I see.

160
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:04,585
It's braised with soybean paste,
so it will taste different.

161
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,753
-What's this?
-Those are pancakes.

162
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,956
-Maybe fish pancakes?
-Frozen pollock pancakes?

163
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:12,226
-Auntie, what type of pancake is this?
-It's Dory fish pancakes.

164
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,494
-Dory fish?
-Also known as moon fish.

165
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:17,097
DORY FISH PANCAKE
AND PAN-FRIED BATTERED MEATBALLS

166
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,668
14 DIFFERENT FRESH SEAFOOD DISHES

167
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,671
-Are these regular dishes?
-No, they're different every time.

168
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:26,473
They vary by season.

169
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:30,244
-Nothing is made from frozen ingredients.
-Where do we start?

170
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:35,382
-I don't know what to eat first.
-Since I'm a regular here, just follow me.

171
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:36,950
-Lead the way.
-Okay.

172
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,886
We'll start with the ones with no sauce.

173
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:43,290
-Let's start with sashimi first.
-We're starting with seafood.

174
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:46,193
-Should we order alcohol now?
-We can't eat this without it.

175
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,196
We don't need to order it.
Water and alcohol are self-serve.

176
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:52,232
Tell me what you want. I'll grab it.

177
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:54,701
Dujun is the youngest, so he'll get them.

178
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:56,803
-What would you like?
-Run for it.

179
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,239
-Some soju, please.
-Bring what you want.

180
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:04,378
-Wait, if the food is this fresh…
-We can have up to eight bottles.

181
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,848
-We shouldn't mix drinks.
-Let's drink them separately.

182
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:10,384
-Let's start with soju first.
-Got it.

183
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,386
We can mix drinks when it gets greasy.

184
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:16,523
There are dishes here
that you can't find in Seoul.

185
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:21,428
You can't easily find
conger eel sashimi or <i>horaegi.</i>

186
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:22,996
These are rare to find.

187
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:28,735
Help yourselves.
I'll plead for more if it's not enough.

188
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:33,740
Let's get started. Gosh, I'm excited.

189
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,109
-Thank you.
-Cheers.

190
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:40,314
GULPING DOWN THE REFRESHING SOJU IN ONE GO

191
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:43,784
-This is <i>hamo.</i>
-It's sweet.

192
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:44,885
Let's eat <i>horaegi.</i>

193
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,620
STARTING WITH BABY OCTOPUS SASHIMI

194
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:50,390
DIP CHEWY BABY OCTOPUS IN <i>CHOJANG</i>

195
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:59,733
SUCKING THE JUICE

196
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,005
CAN'T HELP BUT EXCLAIM

197
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:06,440
I love the chewing sounds.

198
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:10,944
-It sounds great.
-Are we supposed to chew the bones, too?

199
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:12,546
No, spit it out.

200
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,915
HEEBAB ALREADY HAD TWO BITES
WHILE THEY CHATTED

201
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:17,618
-I love the <i>horaegi. </i>It's fresh.
-It's sweet.

202
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:19,987
<i>It's fattier than I thought.</i>

203
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:21,255
A SWEET AND SMOOTH FLAVOR

204
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:22,723
<i>Man, it's delicious.</i>

205
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:28,395
I usually don't enjoy fishy dishes,
but this is just nice and sweet.

206
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:29,963
SUPER SWEET

207
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:34,568
What are some typical
seasonal seafoods, Chef Minseong?

208
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:37,304
-These two dishes on the table.
-The gizzard shad.

209
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:38,539
They're seasonal sashimi.

210
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:45,412
GRAB PLENTY OF FRESH CONGER EEL SASHIMI

211
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,716
Wow, it's so rich in flavor.

212
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:54,021
SUMMER SPECIALTY, CONGER EEL SASHIMI

213
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:57,524
CHEWY AND TENDER TEXTURE

214
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:02,396
DELICIOUSLY SAVORY THE MORE YOU CHEW

215
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:05,432
-Octopus is also a seasonal seafood.
-Octopus?

216
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:08,769
-This is the season.
-The <i>chojang </i>is tasty, too.

217
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:10,704
-It sure is.
-She makes it herself.

218
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:13,473
The horned conch is pleasant, too.

219
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,644
-Do you like it?
-It's sweet.

220
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:19,947
-Is it sweet?
-It's more savory than sweet.

221
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,983
-It is savory.
-I don't know how else to describe it.

222
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,751
WHAT DOES HE MEAN?

223
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:28,255
The ingredients' natural sweetness.
That's what I call pleasant.

224
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:31,024
When we dip food in sugar,
we think it's sweet.

225
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:33,560
-But it's sweet with umami.
-That's right!

226
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:38,799
That's it. I meant to say
it's sweet with a rich umami flavor.

227
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:42,069
My mouth is filled with the flavors
of the waters of Samcheonpo.

228
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:43,504
-Right?
-Really?

229
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,974
-Everything is fresh.
-I just imagined something.

230
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,444
Heebab can devour everything
from the waters off Samcheonpo.

231
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:52,279
ABSOLUTELY POSSIBLE

232
00:11:52,346 --> 00:11:54,281
-It's incredible.
-Next is gizzard shad.

233
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:58,118
<i>-Summer gizzard shad.</i>
<i>-They're rich in fat.</i>

234
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:00,320
Gizzard shad in Seoul come
from the West Sea,

235
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,656
so they smell a bit earthy.

236
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:04,725
<i>But there's no earthy scent in these ones.</i>

237
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,126
SOUTH SEA GIZZARD SHAD

238
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:13,567
SLICE THE SUMMER SILVER-COLORED
GIZZARD SHAD BONE-IN

239
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:18,005
GIZZARD SHAD SASHIMI IS INCREDIBLY CHEWY

240
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,742
CRUNCHING

241
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:22,876
It's savory.

242
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:25,679
It's so rich with flavor.

243
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,548
-Right?
-Yes, it's rich in fat.

244
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:30,450
AFTER A BITE OF FATTY GIZZARD SHAD

245
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,119
DRINKS A GLASS OF SOJU

246
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:34,321
I love crunching the bones.

247
00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:37,591
THE TEXTURE OF THE SMALL BONES
IS IRRESISTIBLE

248
00:12:37,658 --> 00:12:39,993
This place knows what's up.

249
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,695
SATISFIED

250
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:44,898
-I'm happy.
-It's unbelievable.

251
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:49,336
Eating gizzard shad sashimi
when it's in season

252
00:12:49,403 --> 00:12:50,571
"BEST IN PEAK SEASON"

253
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:52,406
-is so good.
-You can only get it here.

254
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:55,209
I never knew you could eat this
in the summer here.

255
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,177
COME TO SAMCHEONPO
FOR SUMMER GIZZARD SHAD

256
00:12:57,811 --> 00:13:04,384
Eating this in the summer makes me feel
like I'm at a movie premiere.

257
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:08,222
Doesn't it feel like you're at a premiere?
Like we're the first ones to try it.

258
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,824
-Definitely.
-That's exactly it.

259
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:15,128
Heebab told us last week
that she didn't enjoy seafood, but…

260
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:18,031
-I realized I--
-Your face lit up.

261
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:20,701
She's suddenly energetic.

262
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:24,238
I usually don't like seafood,
but this is good.

263
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:31,845
-What did you say this was?
-Steamed ray.

264
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:34,715
<i>This is the next dish to try.</i>

265
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:37,117
-How do we eat this?
-Look, the meat rips apart easily.

266
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:39,453
-There's Korean mint in the seasoning.
-Why?

267
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,822
Korean mint and soybean paste
pair well together.

268
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:43,857
It's also great in soybean paste stew.

269
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,360
KOREAN MINT: A UNIQUE AROMATIC SCENT

270
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,529
USED IN THE SOUTHERN COASTAL AREA
FOR AROMATICS

271
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:53,166
ADD KOREAN MINT TO THE SOYBEAN PASTE SAUCE

272
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:59,406
FULLY STEAM THE STINGRAY

273
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:05,212
ADD THE SPECIAL KOREAN MINT
SOYBEAN PASTE SAUCE ON TOP, AND IT'S READY

274
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:08,649
<i>Is this a Gyeongsang-do-style</i>
<i>soybean paste?</i>

275
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:11,084
<i>Yes, they don't make it like this</i>
<i>in Jeolla-do.</i>

276
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,921
TAKING A BITE

277
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:18,692
<i>It seems to have a milder taste this way.</i>

278
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:21,361
<i>-It's not that spicy.</i>
<i>-It's delicious.</i>

279
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:24,131
-The Korean mint is fragrant.
-They go well together.

280
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:26,867
-There are many people…
-It's minty.

281
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:28,569
…who say cilantro smells like soap.

282
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:32,606
This smells way stronger than that.
It's almost like chemicals.

283
00:14:32,673 --> 00:14:33,841
-Isn't it pungent?
-Yes.

284
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:37,578
In Gyeongsang-do, they add it to dishes
like braised spicy monkfish.

285
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:38,745
I take it out.

286
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:42,349
They add it to spicy fish stew,
pancake dishes, and everything.

287
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,351
It tastes bland for us if we leave it out.

288
00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:46,787
-I love Korean mint.
-Me too.

289
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,557
<i>Try this. It has mussels and clam meat.</i>

290
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:53,293
WHAT WILL THE KOREAN MINT
CHIVE PANCAKE TASTE LIKE?

291
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:57,464
ADD MINCED MUSSELS, SHRIMP, AND CHIVES

292
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:01,935
ADD PLENTY OF KOREAN MINT

293
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:07,174
SHE EXPERTLY MIXES THE BATTER BY HAND

294
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:14,615
CHEWY SHRIMP, RICHLY FLAVORED MUSSELS,
AND FRAGRANT KOREAN MINT

295
00:15:15,816 --> 00:15:19,920
CRISPY AND AROMATIC
KOREAN MINT CHIVE PANCAKE IS READY

296
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:23,957
I think Korean mint
is stronger than cilantro.

297
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:25,893
-Many think that.
-Is this Korean mint?

298
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:27,261
There's probably a little.

299
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:30,964
-Is this Korean mint?
-No, they're chives.

300
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:33,166
-Auntie.
-Yes.

301
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:37,204
-Did you add Korean mint to the <i>jijim?</i>
-Yes, I did.

302
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:39,206
You didn't put much in, right?

303
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:41,942
-Not too much.
-I can hardly smell it.

304
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:46,613
Try it. She didn't add that much.
I can barely taste it.

305
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:50,684
-This is fine for me.
-Told you so.

306
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:52,486
-It's tasty.
-It's good.

307
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:54,721
AMAZED AT THE NUTTY TASTE

308
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:58,725
IT SEEMS LIKE HEEBAB LIKES IT

309
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,694
I wasn't sure if we could finish this.

310
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:02,496
-We ate a lot.
-There isn't any left.

311
00:16:02,563 --> 00:16:03,564
WE FINISHED

312
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,632
But nobody ate the sea squirt.

313
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:09,903
-This is also nice, though.
-I'll devour the aroma of the sea.

314
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:12,806
<i>-Sea squirt soju?</i>
<i>-This is the stuff.</i>

315
00:16:12,873 --> 00:16:15,876
MAKING SEA SQUIRT SOJU
FILLED WITH THE AROMA OF THE SEA

316
00:16:15,943 --> 00:16:19,279
-I'll smell the sea every time.
-It doesn't look too bad. Let me try it.

317
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:22,149
-It's like drinking Oyster Shooters.
-Should I try it?

318
00:16:22,216 --> 00:16:26,553
-Put it in.
-They add oysters to vodka in Europe.

319
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,121
Let's go!

320
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,459
WHAT DOES SEA SQUIRT SOJU TASTE LIKE?

321
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:36,496
-Incredible?
-Try it with the pork.

322
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:40,467
To fully embrace Samcheonpo,
you have to drink it like this

323
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:43,403
-You think so?
-It has been embraced.

324
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:46,974
-It has been?
-I'm afraid you can't drink this.

325
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,909
IT'S TOO STRONG FOR HEEBAB!

326
00:16:48,976 --> 00:16:52,079
-You'll spit it out, so don't drink it.
-He knows me so well.

327
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:55,682
-Auntie, please give us the next dish.
-Coming.

328
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:57,651
It's shocking that there's more.

329
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:01,655
I want to try living
in Samcheonpo for a month.

330
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:03,357
Sounds like fun.

331
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,192
Let's say I stay here for a week.

332
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:08,462
I could eat 28 meals
if I ate four meals a day.

333
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:09,530
She's right.

334
00:17:10,664 --> 00:17:12,366
-Oh, my gosh.
-Look at that.

335
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:14,835
-The black sea bream is here.
-Is it fried fish?

336
00:17:14,902 --> 00:17:17,104
-What's this?
-It's rockfish.

337
00:17:17,171 --> 00:17:20,407
GRILLED ROCKFISH

338
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:22,476
What's this?

339
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:24,311
-It's <i>namakseu.</i>
-Sorry?

340
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:28,415
It's the Gyeongsang-do dialect word
for bottom-dwelling cod.

341
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:31,385
-Bottom-dwelling cod?
-Do you call that <i>namakseu </i>here?

342
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:33,620
It's called <i>namakseu </i>when it's dried flat.

343
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:35,455
-It's fermented skate.
-You're right.

344
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:39,226
<i>-It's hongeosamhap.</i>
<i>-This is so much food.</i>

345
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,930
-This is unbelievable.
-There's more.

346
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:45,999
-Is that a yellow croaker?
-It's grilled gizzard shad.

347
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,067
The "daughter-in-law"!

348
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:51,038
GRILLED GIZZARD SHAD

349
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:55,108
<i>There's even cutlassfish.</i>

350
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:59,213
<i>I want to eat these with rice.</i>

351
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,014
<i>-Squid salad?</i>
<i>-That's right.</i>

352
00:18:02,783 --> 00:18:07,387
-Wait, that's a lot of grilled fish.
-Let's dig in.

353
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:10,757
-I know we're filming, but I need a photo.
-Can I take one, too?

354
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:12,726
-Too much food.
-I should've taken one.

355
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,162
Isn't it amazing?

356
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:17,497
<i>-Can you share the photo later?</i>
<i>-Of course.</i>

357
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:18,866

YOON DUJUN'S PHOTO

359
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:22,703
<i>-More food coming.</i>
<i>-There's more!</i>

360
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,439
There's no room left. We're out of space.

361
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:28,141
-What's this, Auntie?
-It's sea eel.

362
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:31,111
STIR-FRIED SEA EEL

363
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:35,349
<i>-This is braised pomfret.</i>
<i>-Sea eel and braised pomfret.</i>

364
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:36,416
<i>We're in trouble.</i>

365
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:37,484
BRAISED POMFRET

366
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:40,120
-There are so many fish dishes.
-I'll eat them all.

367
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:45,959
-These are LA ribs.
-We even have Naseong ribs.

368
00:18:46,026 --> 00:18:47,995
LA RIBS AND <i>BULGOGI</i>

369
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:50,464
Are we getting more
because Chef Minseong is here?

370
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:53,767
-Is this normal?
-It's always like this.

371
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:56,203
-It'd be funny if she serves <i>gimbap.</i>
-Corn cheese?

372
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:00,440
But honestly, her voice is
a bit more gentle because we're shooting.

373
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:02,476
MINSEONG THINKS IT'S FUNNY
HER VOICE CHANGED

374
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,344
Honestly, it's softer.

375
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:06,380
We didn't give them
<i>gimbap </i>and sticky rice.

376
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,584
SECOND ROUND OF DISHES: TIME FOR FISH!

377
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:13,687
-This is too much.
-<i>Gimbap?</i>

378
00:19:13,754 --> 00:19:15,122
What should we eat first?

379
00:19:15,189 --> 00:19:17,191
Let's start with the grilled ones.

380
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:21,428
Among all grilled fish,
my favorite is grilled rockfish.

381
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:22,629
I see.

382
00:19:22,696 --> 00:19:24,531
I was about to eat <i>japchae.</i>

383
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:26,733
-Get a grip!
-I was going for…

384
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,002
Corn cheese? Snap out of it!

385
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:31,872
There are a ton of things to eat.

386
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,575
Let's get rid of this plate.

387
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:36,310
We need to make room for more.

388
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:38,879
Everyone, she's helping us out.

389
00:19:39,713 --> 00:19:41,815
BITING INTO GRILLED ROCKFISH

390
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:45,853
PICKING OUT THE WHITE MEAT

391
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,921
YUM

392
00:19:50,991 --> 00:19:53,160
-Man, the rockfish is tasty.
-It's mild.

393
00:19:53,894 --> 00:19:55,929
EATING WITH HER BARE HANDS

394
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:03,637
<i>-It tastes so clean.</i>
<i>-Absolutely.</i>

395
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:06,440
Grilled fish is expensive in Seoul, right?

396
00:20:06,507 --> 00:20:07,975
ENJOYING PLENTY OF GRILLED FISH

397
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,745
THE FISH MELTS IN THEIR MOUTHS

398
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:14,147
-This is insane.
-The fish is so tender.

399
00:20:14,915 --> 00:20:18,218
-Auntie, can I please get a bowl of rice?
-Sure.

400
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:21,121
Minseong, rockfish was part
of the 12 animals, right?

401
00:20:21,188 --> 00:20:22,823
It had a name. What was it?

402
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,858
-Is it a specialty here?
-Ppollaegi.

403
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:26,793
AUNTIE IS BACK WITH A TRAY OF FOOD

404
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,363
-We really got <i>gimbap!</i>
-Here's sticky rice.

405
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:31,265
Ask for more if it's not enough.

406
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:33,634
They really served <i>gimbap</i>.
They have everything.

407
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,801
<i>Gimbap…</i>

408
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:38,505
They want us to eat rice
to soothe the stomach.

409
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:41,241
-That's right.
-Thank you.

410
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:45,145
This is quite a bargain
for 40,000 won per person.

411
00:20:45,212 --> 00:20:48,282
Let's try the bottom-dwelling cod.
This is so good.

412
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:50,951
-Is it <i>namakseu?</i>
-It's called that when it's dried.

413
00:20:51,018 --> 00:20:52,219
Is it called <i>namakseu?</i>

414
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:54,188
A BIG CHUNK

415
00:20:57,558 --> 00:20:59,927
-Can I try some?
-Dig in!

416
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:02,329
I'll ask for more if it's not enough.

417
00:21:02,396 --> 00:21:04,731
I love the way
Gyeongsang-do people say, "Dig in."

418
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:07,868
-Dig in.
-Time to eat.

419
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:09,670
Dig in. I'll debone it for you.

420
00:21:10,504 --> 00:21:15,042
CRISPY GRILLED BOTTOM-DWELLING COD
FIRM BUT MOIST

421
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:18,846
Minseong deboning the fish
reveals his warmest side.

422
00:21:20,914 --> 00:21:22,883
-I'm a warm person.
-He's an expert at this.

423
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,651
-I'm caring.
-He's the best.

424
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:27,788
Get a spoonful of rice.

425
00:21:31,191 --> 00:21:33,060
<i>Put it on some sticky rice.</i>

426
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:37,464
ADD A BIG PIECE OF BOTTOM-DWELLING COD
ATOP STICKY RICE

427
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:40,300
-This is…
-There's more fish than rice.

428
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:42,703
Eat a big mouthful of it. That's it!

429
00:21:44,238 --> 00:21:45,239
How scrumptious.

430
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:47,975
Isn't it good?

431
00:21:48,842 --> 00:21:52,212
This is out of this world.
It's unbelievable.

432
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:56,016
-The cutlassfish is amazing.
-It sure is.

433
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,584
-It's fresh.
-Of course.

434
00:21:57,651 --> 00:21:58,719
DUJUN IS FOCUSED

435
00:21:58,886 --> 00:22:01,588
<i>-Were they frozen?</i>
<i>-No, frozen ones can't be this soft.</i>

436
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:03,390
MORE TENDER SINCE IT'S FRESH

437
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:12,733
CUTLASSFISH GRILLED IN PLENTY OF OIL

438
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,471
Frozen ones aren't easy to eat,
but fresh ones just melt in your mouth.

439
00:22:17,538 --> 00:22:20,607
TAKE A GOLDEN BROWN PIECE

440
00:22:21,141 --> 00:22:22,876
I should get you a bowl for the bones.

441
00:22:22,943 --> 00:22:23,977
STRAIGHT IN!

442
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:27,114
ONE SURPRISE AFTER ANOTHER

443
00:22:27,981 --> 00:22:31,151
DEBONE THE CUTLASSFISH NICELY

444
00:22:33,453 --> 00:22:37,524
-Here's some. Grab it and eat it.
-Of course.

445
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:44,498
Isn't it good?

446
00:22:45,966 --> 00:22:46,967
This is insane.

447
00:22:49,503 --> 00:22:50,671
It's that scrumptious.

448
00:22:52,573 --> 00:22:55,242
-Gosh, it's incredibly soft.
-It's so good.

449
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:57,144
A TEXTURE LIKE SOFT SPONGE CAKE

450
00:22:57,211 --> 00:22:59,813
I'm obsessed with this. It's awesome.

451
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,716
I'll push these tiny bones
down my throat with <i>gimbap.</i>

452
00:23:03,784 --> 00:23:05,185
Pushing it down with <i>gimbap.</i>

453
00:23:05,252 --> 00:23:07,154
-That's a risky way to eat.
-Definitely.

454
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:10,090
DEVOURING THE GRILLED CUTLASSFISH

455
00:23:10,157 --> 00:23:12,125
-I mean, this place is…
-It's terrific.

456
00:23:12,192 --> 00:23:14,361
-Come here when you're having a good day.
-Yes.

457
00:23:14,428 --> 00:23:18,332
This isn't the place to come with a friend
to drink when you're having a bad day.

458
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:21,268
You can't have a conversation
to resolve a problem here.

459
00:23:21,335 --> 00:23:22,336
Exactly.

460
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:25,506
It's just a place to laugh
when you want to celebrate.

461
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:28,375
Your friend won't listen to you here.

462
00:23:28,442 --> 00:23:30,811
NOBODY IS LISTENING

463
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:32,479
THROWING A FISH PARTY

464
00:23:32,546 --> 00:23:35,249
<i>-The cutlassfish is excellent.</i>
<i>-The pork reduces the smell.</i>

465
00:23:35,315 --> 00:23:36,783
<i>Can I eat two pieces at once?</i>

466
00:23:37,451 --> 00:23:40,487
-It's not over until it's over.
-Look here.

467
00:23:41,321 --> 00:23:44,057
-Is there any soup here?
-You bet there is.

468
00:23:44,124 --> 00:23:45,158
OF COURSE THERE IS

469
00:23:45,225 --> 00:23:48,662
-Auntie, bring us some soup, please.
-Coming.

470
00:23:48,729 --> 00:23:49,730
What an amazing meal.

471
00:23:50,297 --> 00:23:51,765
It's over if you say that.

472
00:23:51,832 --> 00:23:53,267
IS DUJUN COMPLETELY STUFFED?

473
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:54,501
Destroy the gizzard shad!

474
00:23:56,203 --> 00:23:58,172
Where does all that food go?

475
00:23:58,238 --> 00:23:59,640
-Impressive.
-In my stomach.

476
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:01,441
We've had two meals with her,

477
00:24:01,975 --> 00:24:04,444
and it feels
like she's eating a normal meal.

478
00:24:04,511 --> 00:24:08,115
When you take one bite,
I take three or four bites.

479
00:24:08,182 --> 00:24:12,186
-People don't notice that I do that.
-I really can't tell. I had no clue.

480
00:24:12,986 --> 00:24:15,088
-Another dish is here.
-Is that lobster?

481
00:24:15,155 --> 00:24:16,156
UNBELIEVABLE

482
00:24:16,223 --> 00:24:17,858
-What's this?
-Abalone porridge.

483
00:24:17,925 --> 00:24:20,127
-Abalone porridge?
-Enjoy.

484
00:24:20,194 --> 00:24:21,995
I love this.

485
00:24:22,362 --> 00:24:23,997
-This is amazing.
-Is that octopus?

486
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,533
-It's a small octopus.
-But it's so big.

487
00:24:27,367 --> 00:24:29,269
<i>It's the size of a big octopus.</i>

488
00:24:31,171 --> 00:24:35,409
-This is clam soup.
-Why are the Manila clams so big here?

489
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:37,811
-The Manila clams…
-I've never seen them this big.

490
00:24:37,878 --> 00:24:39,780
Divers caught these themselves.

491
00:24:39,847 --> 00:24:42,683
<i>-So, do the divers go underwater?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

492
00:24:42,749 --> 00:24:44,885
<i>That's why they're so meaty.</i>

493
00:24:45,552 --> 00:24:47,287
There's even lobster!

494
00:24:47,354 --> 00:24:50,157
GRILLED LOBSTER

495
00:24:50,224 --> 00:24:53,427
-Wow, this meal is a great deal.
-I agree.

496
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:57,364
-It's 50,000 won for a table of two.
-That's still cheap. This meal is a steal.

497
00:24:57,431 --> 00:24:58,932
ROUND 3: SOOTHE YOUR STOMACH

498
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:01,568
-It's enormous.
-It's smaller than usual.

499
00:25:02,903 --> 00:25:06,006
JUICY AND MEATY MANILA CLAMS

500
00:25:06,073 --> 00:25:09,042
-I've never seen Manila clams this big.
-It's yummy.

501
00:25:09,643 --> 00:25:11,445
They look like short-neck clams.

502
00:25:11,512 --> 00:25:13,280
Try the broth. It's fantastic.

503
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:20,521
Seafood doesn't really fill me up.

504
00:25:20,587 --> 00:25:22,222
Gosh, the soup is good.

505
00:25:23,123 --> 00:25:24,224
<i>The soup is rich.</i>

506
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:26,126
FALLING IN LOVE WITH MANILA CLAM SOUP

507
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:27,594
<i>It's helping with digestion.</i>

508
00:25:28,061 --> 00:25:29,396
Gosh, I'm loving this.

509
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:35,435
SCOOPING UP HEAPS OF ABALONE PORRIDGE

510
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,043
EATING NONSTOP

511
00:25:47,247 --> 00:25:48,549
The porridge is great.

512
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:52,286
<i>This is insanely good.</i>

513
00:25:52,352 --> 00:25:55,088
<i>It's a clear version.</i>

514
00:25:55,856 --> 00:25:57,658
Today I ate the most seafood ever.

515
00:25:57,724 --> 00:25:59,226
This is good for our health.

516
00:25:59,293 --> 00:26:00,761
SEAFOOD REVITALIZES US

517
00:26:02,129 --> 00:26:03,931
<i>The ingredients here are all huge.</i>

518
00:26:03,997 --> 00:26:06,366
<i>I'm really loving Samcheonpo.</i>

519
00:26:06,433 --> 00:26:08,769
It's awesome that we can eat our fill.

520
00:26:08,836 --> 00:26:10,537
Yes, the people here are generous.

521
00:26:11,371 --> 00:26:12,706
CAN'T HELP BUT ADMIRE THE TASTE

522
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,941
Eat with your spoon.

523
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:15,409
FIRM AND CHEWY SMALL OCTOPUS

524
00:26:15,475 --> 00:26:17,544
-Dip it in sesame oil and salt.
-Exactly.

525
00:26:17,611 --> 00:26:20,247
-It's so chewy.
-Gosh, it's still alive.

526
00:26:20,314 --> 00:26:22,583
DAVID LEE SHOWS FUNNY MOVES
BEFORE SLURPING THE BABY OCTOPUS

527
00:26:24,818 --> 00:26:26,053
This is also tasty.

528
00:26:28,488 --> 00:26:31,091
Seriously, she eats so much.

529
00:26:31,158 --> 00:26:32,693
Talk after you eat.

530
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:36,463
She'll still be eating,
and we are completely stuffed.

531
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,498
HER MEAL BEGINS
WHEN EVERYONE ELSE GETS FULL

532
00:26:40,567 --> 00:26:44,771
Since there are so many dishes,
let's team up for the game.

533
00:26:44,838 --> 00:26:47,641
I'll team up with Heebab.

534
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:51,645
Wait, I have to think
about the food pairing.

535
00:26:51,712 --> 00:26:53,547
-I have one.
-You do?

536
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:56,083
-Heebab is eating it all up.
-I'm not.

537
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:58,452
What should we use for our pairing?

538
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:01,021
-What ingredients…
-Should we ask for more?

539
00:27:01,088 --> 00:27:03,123
Auntie, can we get
a refill of these dishes?

540
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,191
Sure.

541
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,193
-Will you eat more?
-Yes.

542
00:27:08,195 --> 00:27:10,130
-She'll eat more.
-That was just an excuse.

543
00:27:10,564 --> 00:27:12,766
-We finished the Manila clam soup.
-We sure did.

544
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:15,869
-And the ribs.
-Yes, there was a lot at first!

545
00:27:15,936 --> 00:27:19,640
-Absolutely.
-It's all gone. This is incredible.

546
00:27:21,575 --> 00:27:22,910
THE REFILLS ARE HERE

547
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:24,311
I can start again.

548
00:27:24,378 --> 00:27:26,480
Is this common at this place?

549
00:27:28,415 --> 00:27:31,952
<i>HONGEOSAMHAP, </i>DORY FISH PANCAKE, MEATBALLS
KOREAN MINT CHIVE PANCAKE

550
00:27:32,019 --> 00:27:36,123
Are there customers
who eat all of these various dishes?

551
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,859
There aren't many people
who finish all of this.

552
00:27:38,926 --> 00:27:40,427
I think you're eating a lot.

553
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:45,098
-They don't ask for more, right?
-They do once in a while.

554
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:47,901
Some people ask for more.

555
00:27:47,968 --> 00:27:48,969
MORE MANILA CLAM SOUP

556
00:27:50,871 --> 00:27:54,875
Why don't we try making the food pairing?

557
00:27:54,942 --> 00:27:56,844
Heebab, let's quickly--

558
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:00,514
We need squid salad, <i>gimbap,</i>
and seasoned bean sprout.

559
00:28:01,615 --> 00:28:03,016
-Hold on.
-Will you mix them?

560
00:28:03,617 --> 00:28:05,419
-Impressive.
-A dessert for Koreans.

561
00:28:05,485 --> 00:28:09,389
Add the <i>gimbap </i>to a bowl with sesame oil.

562
00:28:09,456 --> 00:28:10,991
That's against the rules.

563
00:28:11,058 --> 00:28:12,292
That can never fail.

564
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:15,596
-It's yummy if we cut it up.
-You're good at this.

565
00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:17,064
Should I cut up more?

566
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:19,700
-That's good. We need texture.
-Is this it?

567
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,969
NOW, IT'S HEEBAB'S TURN

568
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:23,403
This was Heebab's idea.

569
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:26,807
-This seasoning was so delicious.
-Right.

570
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:30,544
-It's like squid salad <i>bibimbap.</i>
-It will be sweet and tangy.

571
00:28:31,144 --> 00:28:32,145
Sweet and tangy.

572
00:28:33,514 --> 00:28:35,582
-There.
-Aren't you cutting it?

573
00:28:36,183 --> 00:28:39,052
-Should we cut it up?
-Sure, let's do that.

574
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,421
-You're helping them.
-Why'd I say that?

575
00:28:41,488 --> 00:28:44,658
-Why are you helping them?
-I shouldn't have given them that tip.

576
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:47,261
-It's like raw fish <i>bibimbap.</i>
-Everyone, watch.

577
00:28:47,327 --> 00:28:48,929
Mix it up.

578
00:28:49,363 --> 00:28:50,864
This will be delicious.

579
00:28:51,498 --> 00:28:53,467
-I'll try it.
-Show them how it looks.

580
00:28:57,704 --> 00:28:59,406
It's amazing. I mean it.

581
00:29:02,776 --> 00:29:03,810
It's so good.

582
00:29:03,877 --> 00:29:04,878
ANXIOUS

583
00:29:04,945 --> 00:29:06,013
Man, this is…

584
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,583
-We have to beat them.
-This is a classic flavor.

585
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,752
-The seasoning did it all.
-We have to win.

586
00:29:11,818 --> 00:29:13,453
THE SQUID SALAD SEASONING IS KEY

587
00:29:14,721 --> 00:29:17,624
-What are you looking for?
-Do you have a rolling mat?

588
00:29:17,691 --> 00:29:19,560
Are you making <i>gimbap?</i>

589
00:29:19,626 --> 00:29:22,629
Let's roll some <i>gimbap.</i>

590
00:29:22,963 --> 00:29:26,233
MINSEONG HAS BROUGHT
A ROLLING MAT AND PERILLA LEAVES

591
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,701
Are you making <i>futomaki?</i>

592
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:30,404
He's using his main skills.

593
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:33,040
-It's not that.
-He's making a Japanese dish.

594
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:34,107
I'm curious.

595
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,011
Using that instead of seaweed?

596
00:29:38,078 --> 00:29:39,546
HE IS USING THE ENTIRE <i>JIJIM</i>

597
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:42,850
-This is against the rules.
-I'll wrap it up with this.

598
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,751
What's wrong?

599
00:29:44,818 --> 00:29:46,620
I'll do my best to catch the rabbits.

600
00:29:46,687 --> 00:29:48,355
These two rabbits are trying to win.

601
00:29:49,957 --> 00:29:51,592
He's adding the perilla leaves.

602
00:29:53,627 --> 00:29:54,628
You're adding <i>japchae?</i>

603
00:29:54,962 --> 00:29:58,565
This is full of carbs.
It's not good for the owner's health.

604
00:29:58,632 --> 00:29:59,733
<i>JAPCHAE </i>INSTEAD OF RICE

605
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,903
-Wow, it looks good though.
-Looks great.

606
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,972
Add sesame oil and salt.
It's seasoned well.

607
00:30:05,572 --> 00:30:07,441
Hold on, Minseong!

608
00:30:08,408 --> 00:30:10,611
It might get in the way while chewing.

609
00:30:10,677 --> 00:30:12,479
It's tender, so it's probably okay.

610
00:30:13,914 --> 00:30:14,915
TESTING THE TEXTURE

611
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:16,550
I told you it's all right.

612
00:30:17,351 --> 00:30:18,919
It needs some chewiness.

613
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:20,921
It needs texture.

614
00:30:21,522 --> 00:30:22,523
That's it.

615
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:24,825
IN SYNC WITH <i>GIMBAP</i>

616
00:30:26,393 --> 00:30:28,829
-Please.
-Wow, he's skilled.

617
00:30:29,263 --> 00:30:30,964
It looks amazing.

618
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:32,032
It's his specialty.

619
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:34,768
He's thrilled.

620
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:37,571
TIME TO SLICE IT

621
00:30:37,938 --> 00:30:39,239
We just need one good piece.

622
00:30:39,706 --> 00:30:40,841
Her mouth might burst.

623
00:30:40,908 --> 00:30:42,142
GIGANTIC

624
00:30:42,442 --> 00:30:45,746
It's kind of like
an inside-out version of stuffed squid.

625
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:48,882
-It looks nice.
-But Auntie's the one eating it.

626
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:50,884
It's a bit too big.

627
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:53,921
IT'S READY

628
00:30:54,421 --> 00:30:55,789
TRYING TO ADD THE OTHER PIECES

629
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:57,324
No, take it out.

630
00:30:57,391 --> 00:30:58,525
Give it to me.

631
00:31:00,994 --> 00:31:02,262
She's helpful.

632
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:03,864
THE REST IS FOR HEEBAB

633
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:07,835
-Silbi <i>gimbap.</i>
-Ours is Silbi-<i>bimbap.</i>

634
00:31:07,901 --> 00:31:09,169
-Silbi<i>-bimbap.</i>
-Right.

635
00:31:09,236 --> 00:31:10,737
SILBI-<i>BIMBAP </i>VS SILBI <i>GIMBAP</i>

636
00:31:10,804 --> 00:31:14,041
<i>Auntie, can you be the judge</i>
<i>for our contest?</i>

637
00:31:14,107 --> 00:31:18,612
It's made from today's ingredients,
so choose the pairing that tastes best.

638
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:21,548
The losing team will wash the dishes
and clean up afterward.

639
00:31:22,182 --> 00:31:25,619
-Thank you for judging.
-I'll be fair and square.

640
00:31:25,686 --> 00:31:27,054
TRYING THE SILBI-<i>BIMBAP </i>FIRST

641
00:31:27,821 --> 00:31:28,822
How is it?

642
00:31:29,489 --> 00:31:30,591
WILL SHE LIKE IT?

643
00:31:30,657 --> 00:31:31,658
How is it?

644
00:31:32,526 --> 00:31:34,862
-It's good.
-That's great.

645
00:31:34,928 --> 00:31:36,396
It's nutty.

646
00:31:36,463 --> 00:31:38,665
And the fact that you made <i>bibimbap</i>

647
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:41,668
with all our various dishes
makes it very special.

648
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:44,538
-She likes it.
-She enjoyed it, Chef Minseong.

649
00:31:46,173 --> 00:31:47,741
It's the best.

650
00:31:48,075 --> 00:31:52,713
But she only ate a tiny amount.
Do you think she can eat this in one bite?

651
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:56,850
-I can't.
-She can't.

652
00:31:57,451 --> 00:31:59,453
SULLEN

653
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,154
Cut it in half and try it.

654
00:32:01,221 --> 00:32:04,324
You can eat that in one bite. Try it!

655
00:32:05,459 --> 00:32:07,794
GETTING READY

656
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:14,334
TAKES A SMALL BITE

657
00:32:15,135 --> 00:32:18,338
-Wait, she didn't finish.
-It was too big.

658
00:32:19,072 --> 00:32:22,109
THEY LOWER THEIR HEADS IN UNISON

659
00:32:22,709 --> 00:32:26,146
Wait, you can't cry, Minseong.

660
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:30,951
Which food pairing
would you recommend to a customer?

661
00:32:31,351 --> 00:32:33,687
I like this way better.

662
00:32:33,754 --> 00:32:35,589
SHE CHOSE THE SILBI-<i>BIMBAP</i>

663
00:32:36,456 --> 00:32:40,794
The <i>gimbap </i>was fine, but this was better.

664
00:32:40,861 --> 00:32:42,496
HEEBAB AND DUJUN WIN!

665
00:32:42,863 --> 00:32:44,965
I told you it was too big.

666
00:32:45,032 --> 00:32:46,667
If only her mouth were bigger.

667
00:32:46,733 --> 00:32:50,170
MEANWHILE, HEEBAB TRIES THE DISHES

668
00:32:51,071 --> 00:32:52,806
Auntie has betrayed me.

669
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:58,879
<i>How many dishes did we have in total?</i>

670
00:32:58,946 --> 00:33:01,315
We can't count them. There are too many.

671
00:33:01,381 --> 00:33:04,017
Auntie, how many dishes did we eat?

672
00:33:04,084 --> 00:33:07,855
Today, we served 41 dishes,
including the refills.

673
00:33:07,921 --> 00:33:08,989
-Forty-one?
-What?

674
00:33:09,056 --> 00:33:11,225
-I told you.
-Wow, he was right.

675
00:33:11,792 --> 00:33:13,760
<i>-This was amazing.</i>
<i>-I'm stuffed!</i>

676
00:33:13,827 --> 00:33:14,828
<i>That was a great meal.</i>

677
00:33:14,895 --> 00:33:16,730
THEY HAD A TOTAL OF 41 DISHES

678
00:33:17,931 --> 00:33:22,169
What does this go-to spot mean to you,
Chef Minseong?

679
00:33:22,236 --> 00:33:26,406
First of all,
I'm confident in bringing anyone here.

680
00:33:26,473 --> 00:33:29,776
-Not everyone will like the food I like.
-That's true.

681
00:33:29,977 --> 00:33:33,247
But this place
will never disappoint anyone.

682
00:33:33,313 --> 00:33:35,849
It's a place
where people can truly enjoy the food.

683
00:33:35,916 --> 00:33:39,186
It's a place where people say,
"I'm absolutely stuffed."

684
00:33:39,253 --> 00:33:40,854
You're full, but you keep eating.

685
00:33:40,921 --> 00:33:42,189
-Incredible.
-I feel that.

686
00:33:42,256 --> 00:33:44,191
-I'm happy.
-I had a great meal.

687
00:33:44,258 --> 00:33:46,260
-Was it good?
-Yes, it was awesome.

688
00:33:46,326 --> 00:33:48,962
It's a practical utopia.

689
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:51,832
I'm sorry to even say
the word "practical."

690
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:53,700
-What a bargain.
-A hearty meal.

691
00:33:53,767 --> 00:33:54,768
I agree.

692
00:33:54,835 --> 00:33:56,770
I haven't been somewhere like this ever.

693
00:33:56,837 --> 00:33:59,907
How was it, Heebab? Are you stuffed?

694
00:33:59,973 --> 00:34:02,075
-I'm pleasantly full now.
-Really?

695
00:34:09,816 --> 00:34:10,884
Thank you for the meal.

696
00:34:10,951 --> 00:34:14,454
HEEBAB WON'T STOP EATING

697
00:34:15,255 --> 00:34:18,125
SHE'S CALM AMID THE CHAOS

698
00:34:18,492 --> 00:34:19,493
I'm so happy.

699
00:34:20,527 --> 00:34:22,930
HEEBAB'S HAPPY <i>MUKBANG </i>IS NOT OVER

700
00:34:22,996 --> 00:34:26,099
Gosh, I told you the bite was too big.

701
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:28,635
It's because she can't eat chili pepper.

702
00:34:31,104 --> 00:34:33,740
Minseong, when was the last time
you washed dishes?

703
00:34:33,807 --> 00:34:37,444
It's been a while. I haven't done it
since I opened my own restaurant.

704
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:40,447
Well done.

705
00:34:40,514 --> 00:34:41,548
DONE IN A FLASH

706
00:34:41,615 --> 00:34:43,917
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.

707
00:34:43,984 --> 00:34:44,985
Let's hit the slate.

708
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:47,487
-Thank you.
-Great job.
