00:00:02,045 --> 00:00:05,015
SEOGYO-DONG, MAPO-GU, SEOUL

2
00:00:05,782 --> 00:00:08,451
WHICH FOODIE BROTHERS SHOWED UP
ON THIS PITCH-BLACK NIGHT?

3
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:10,453
THE FOURTH, YOON DUJUN

4
00:00:11,021 --> 00:00:12,455
THE ELDEST, KIM MINSEONG

5
00:00:12,522 --> 00:00:13,623
THE SECOND, DAVID LEE

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,360
Where are we, Minseong?

7
00:00:17,427 --> 00:00:20,564
We are near Hongik University.
It's just around the corner.

8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,633
<i>We are in between Seogyo-dong</i>
<i>and Yeonnam-dong.</i>

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,801
<i>We're in a triangle.</i>

10
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:27,170
<i>We're at the center of the triangle.</i>

11
00:00:27,971 --> 00:00:31,741
There aren't many restaurants here.
It's more of a residential area.

12
00:00:31,808 --> 00:00:32,943
A QUIET NEIGHBORHOOD

13
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:35,412
<i>There are just ordinary stores here.</i>

14
00:00:35,478 --> 00:00:38,048
THE GO-TO SPOT IS HIDDEN
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE

15
00:00:38,114 --> 00:00:40,717
We will be meeting today's chef soon.

16
00:00:40,784 --> 00:00:42,319
Who invited the chef?

17
00:00:42,385 --> 00:00:45,388
-I invited him.
-Who is he?

18
00:00:45,455 --> 00:00:47,090
He's even bigger than I am.

19
00:00:47,157 --> 00:00:48,725
-Okay.
-He's also younger.

20
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:50,560
-Who is it?
-His aura is…

21
00:00:50,961 --> 00:00:54,264
Jeez, why aren't they here yet?

22
00:00:55,131 --> 00:00:57,434
Dang, I'm hungry.

23
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,535
LOOKS INTIMIDATING

24
00:00:59,436 --> 00:01:02,339
RESTLESS

25
00:01:02,405 --> 00:01:04,641
-Hint?
-He's the best yakitori chef in Korea.

26
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:06,243
Now I know who he is.

27
00:01:06,843 --> 00:01:08,178
I still have no clue.

28
00:01:08,245 --> 00:01:10,447
-You probably don't know.
-I have no idea.

29
00:01:10,513 --> 00:01:13,149
You can see instantly
why he's like a beast.

30
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:17,254
They should be here by now.

31
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,089
TOTALLY STARVING

32
00:01:19,155 --> 00:01:20,423
I see no restaurants.

33
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,859
-Are we there yet?
-Yes, we're almost there.

34
00:01:26,029 --> 00:01:28,765
WHERE IS TODAY'S GO-TO PLACE?

35
00:01:29,432 --> 00:01:31,735
-There it is.
-Of course, I know this place!

36
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:34,704
-It's super famous.
-I've never heard of this place.

37
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:37,340
It's okay if you haven't.
You will learn today.

38
00:01:37,407 --> 00:01:39,476
TODAY'S GO-TO SPOT IS BRIGHTLY LIT

39
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:42,279
-There he is.
-He's like a bear.

40
00:01:42,345 --> 00:01:43,780
Wow, it's a yakitori place.

41
00:01:44,548 --> 00:01:46,650
-Hi.
-Hello, come inside.

42
00:01:46,716 --> 00:01:48,818
WELCOMED WITH A WARM GREETING

43
00:01:48,885 --> 00:01:50,120
How have you been?

44
00:01:50,186 --> 00:01:51,488
Nice to meet you.

45
00:01:51,555 --> 00:01:53,156
It's a pleasure to meet you.

46
00:01:53,223 --> 00:01:55,191
-Please sit here.
-Thank you.

47
00:01:56,726 --> 00:01:58,562
YAKITORI IS A CHICKEN-BASED DISH

48
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:02,732
TRADITIONAL JAPANESE-STYLE SKEWERS
GRILLED OVER CHARCOAL

49
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:05,902
ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS
YAKITORI CHEFS IN KOREA

50
00:02:06,536 --> 00:02:09,005
KIM BYOUNGMOOK, YAKITORI CHEF FOR 7 YEARS

51
00:02:09,072 --> 00:02:12,242
-Wow, it's so nice to meet you, Chef.
-Happy to meet you.

52
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:15,412
HE'S GOT A CHARMING SMILE

53
00:02:15,478 --> 00:02:17,681
-I love the vibes here.
-I agree.

54
00:02:17,747 --> 00:02:20,717
<i>The restaurant is very cozy and nice.</i>

55
00:02:20,784 --> 00:02:22,586
<i>-It's like we're in Japan.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>

56
00:02:23,053 --> 00:02:25,021
<i>It's set up like a Japanese bar.</i>

57
00:02:25,088 --> 00:02:27,023
IT GIVES OFF A JAPANESE BAR VIBE

58
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,393
If you sit around a table,
you can talk to each other.

59
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,963
If you sit at the counter,
you can chat with the owner.

60
00:02:33,029 --> 00:02:34,197
That's right.

61
00:02:34,264 --> 00:02:36,032
Do you like chatting with customers?

62
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:37,334
Yes, I enjoy it.

63
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,401
KIM SANGHO, OWNER

64
00:02:38,468 --> 00:02:42,372
-It's fun to talk about our everyday life.
-That sounds nice.

65
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:44,908
-And then we start drinking together.
-Absolutely.

66
00:02:45,742 --> 00:02:46,910
Let's eat all of these.

67
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:50,313
<i>I love skewers.</i>

68
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,883
<i>-Skewers are the best.</i>
<i>-That's right.</i>

69
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:57,287
DOES TODAY'S GO-TO SPOT
SPECIALIZE IN SKEWERS?

70
00:02:57,354 --> 00:03:01,491
If you look at their logo,
it's shaped like a skewer.

71
00:03:01,558 --> 00:03:03,226
-Yes.
-Looks like food on a skewer.

72
00:03:03,293 --> 00:03:08,064
This logo resembles
the Japanese word "<i>kushi</i>,"

73
00:03:08,131 --> 00:03:09,399
<i>which means skewers.</i>

74
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:12,702
-<i>Kushikatsu </i>means "deep-fried skewer."
-Got it.

75
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:15,906
-It's also part of this restaurant's name.
-I see.

76
00:03:15,972 --> 00:03:17,774
That's why it's all skewered like this.

77
00:03:17,841 --> 00:03:21,845
He deep-fries the ingredients
on skewers after it's ordered.

78
00:03:21,912 --> 00:03:25,715
-That sounds yummy.
-It's more of a bar snack than a meal.

79
00:03:25,782 --> 00:03:27,183
That's what I think.

80
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,352
But don't you have proper meals here?

81
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,756
I always drink with my meals.

82
00:03:33,323 --> 00:03:34,958
That's why this is a full meal.

83
00:03:35,025 --> 00:03:36,059
HE ENJOYS DRINKING

84
00:03:36,126 --> 00:03:38,161
You're a yakitori chef.

85
00:03:38,228 --> 00:03:41,231
Why is your go-to spot a skewer place?
Aren't you tired of it?

86
00:03:41,298 --> 00:03:43,800
-I mostly use chicken in my dishes.
-Right.

87
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:46,503
But this place uses various ingredients.

88
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,673
So, I eat here to learn more about them.

89
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,475
-You two told me you've been here before.
-Of course.

90
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:56,346
-This spot has a long history.
-It's nostalgic.

91
00:03:56,413 --> 00:03:58,248
It has such a nostalgic vibe.

92
00:03:58,315 --> 00:04:00,850
MINSEONG AND DAVID AGREE
THAT THIS SPOT IS NOSTALGIC

93
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:06,356
There are many famous <i>kushikatsu </i>places,
but this spot has been around the longest.

94
00:04:07,524 --> 00:04:10,160
And it's also terrifying, but warm.

95
00:04:10,227 --> 00:04:13,463
"Terrifying, but warm"?
What does that mean?

96
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:16,233
GIVES A KNOWING SMILE

97
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:18,134
If you look at this in front of you,

98
00:04:18,768 --> 00:04:21,104
the rules of the restaurant
are listed here.

99
00:04:21,171 --> 00:04:22,205
CUSTOMER GUIDELINES

100
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:26,209
FROM HOW TO ORDER
TO HOW TO ENJOY YOUR MEAL

101
00:04:26,276 --> 00:04:28,778
If you follow the rules,
it's a warm place.

102
00:04:28,845 --> 00:04:30,046
If you don't, it's scary.

103
00:04:30,647 --> 00:04:31,681
For instance…

104
00:04:31,748 --> 00:04:33,516
-Why is that?
-Look at his face.

105
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,552
Wait, I feel intimidated.

106
00:04:35,619 --> 00:04:40,257
They're twice as big as you, Dujun.
The guy next to you and in front of you.

107
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:42,092
THE OWNER HAS A BIG BUILD AS WELL

108
00:04:42,158 --> 00:04:44,027
I'll behave tonight.

109
00:04:44,094 --> 00:04:46,696
What should we order?

110
00:04:46,763 --> 00:04:49,366
First, order the omakase.

111
00:04:49,432 --> 00:04:51,001
Look at rule number five.

112
00:04:51,902 --> 00:04:53,603
According to Chapter 1, Verse 5…

113
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,838
THE CHEF CHOOSES THE MENU

114
00:04:54,905 --> 00:04:57,641
"If you're new here,
we recommend the omakase."

115
00:04:57,707 --> 00:05:00,844
"We'll deep-fry five skewers for you."

116
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:03,647
We will order the omakase, then.

117
00:05:03,713 --> 00:05:05,115
-All right.
-Nice.

118
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:08,985
Here is the cabbage.
Enjoy it with a bit of salt.

119
00:05:09,052 --> 00:05:10,487
-Is this cabbage?
-Yes.

120
00:05:10,554 --> 00:05:13,723
FRESH CABBAGE WILL CUT
THE GREASINESS OF THE DEEP-FRIED FOOD

121
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,427
-Eating cabbage with salt is new to me.
-It's probably a special kind of salt.

122
00:05:17,494 --> 00:05:18,762
This is the salt.

123
00:05:18,828 --> 00:05:20,497
-Oh, is this the special salt?
-Yes.

124
00:05:20,564 --> 00:05:23,833
<i>-It's not just ordinary salt.</i>
<i>-Oh, it's full of other ingredients.</i>

125
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,969
<i>-You can see the black dots.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

126
00:05:26,603 --> 00:05:28,204
This is green laver powder.

127
00:05:28,271 --> 00:05:32,442
<i>There is a ton of umami</i>
<i>in various types of seaweed.</i>

128
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:34,744
When this is mixed in with salt,

129
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:36,479
it tastes absolutely delicious.

130
00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:38,882
THE PERFECT BALANCE OF FLAVORS

131
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:41,151
Let me try this cabbage with salt.

132
00:05:42,852 --> 00:05:44,254
CRUNCHY

133
00:05:45,088 --> 00:05:48,024
WHAT DOES IT TASTE LIKE?

134
00:05:48,091 --> 00:05:50,360
That's why it's full of umami.

135
00:05:51,494 --> 00:05:54,664
<i>It's sweet and salty when the salt mixes</i>
<i>with the sweet cabbage.</i>

136
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:56,466
SWEET AND SALTY COMBINATION

137
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:58,435
Does anyone have any allergies?

138
00:05:59,102 --> 00:06:00,303
-I don't have any.
-No.

139
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,871
Got it. I'll prepare the food.

140
00:06:02,472 --> 00:06:05,208
-It's fun to watch the process.
-Yes, we can watch him cook.

141
00:06:05,275 --> 00:06:07,544
I always sit here.
I don't ever go to that corner.

142
00:06:08,712 --> 00:06:10,080
He's using chicken tenderloin.

143
00:06:10,146 --> 00:06:12,582
He's starting with the chicken tenderloin.

144
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:16,353
So, it seems like he's starting
with milder ingredients.

145
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:18,822
It's great to start with something tender.

146
00:06:20,156 --> 00:06:23,126
COVERS THE CHICKEN TENDERLOIN WITH FLOUR
SO THE BATTER STICKS WELL

147
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,297
COATS IT WITH BATTER MIX FOR JUICINESS

148
00:06:27,364 --> 00:06:30,166
REMOVES ANY EXTRA BATTER
SO IT DOESN'T GET TOO THICK

149
00:06:32,903 --> 00:06:37,340
COATS IT WITH WET BREADCRUMBS
FOR MORE CRISPINESS

150
00:06:37,407 --> 00:06:38,875
Oh, this is fun.

151
00:06:38,942 --> 00:06:40,443
THEY ARE CAPTIVATED

152
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,979
Does everyone get a skewer?

153
00:06:43,046 --> 00:06:45,582
-Yes, because we can't share.
-I see.

154
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:47,350
EMBARRASSED

155
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:48,852
"Because we can't share."

156
00:06:49,986 --> 00:06:52,789
DUNKS THE CHICKEN TENDERLOIN IN FRESH OIL

157
00:06:53,423 --> 00:06:56,593
ADDS TWO MORE SKEWERS

158
00:06:57,594 --> 00:07:01,565
IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S RAINING, BUT IT'S NOT

159
00:07:02,165 --> 00:07:03,233
It's mouthwatering.

160
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,903
SUPER THRILLED TO TRY IT

161
00:07:07,537 --> 00:07:09,973
GOLDEN BROWN

162
00:07:10,874 --> 00:07:14,211
THE GOLDEN BROWN SKEWER
LOOKS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS

163
00:07:15,145 --> 00:07:18,081
SHOWS OFF HIS SKILL OF SHAKING OFF THE OIL

164
00:07:18,682 --> 00:07:21,484
THE OWNER'S SECRET
TO MAXIMIZING CRISPINESS

165
00:07:21,551 --> 00:07:24,221
The first dish of the omakase is ready.

166
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,258
I'm so excited.

167
00:07:28,325 --> 00:07:30,760
-Here is the chicken tenderloin.
-It's here.

168
00:07:31,528 --> 00:07:33,163
<i>It looks amazing.</i>

169
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,565
<i>It's been a while since I've had this.</i>

170
00:07:35,632 --> 00:07:37,167
<i>If you look at the coating,</i>

171
00:07:37,234 --> 00:07:39,869
<i>the big breadcrumbs</i>
<i>are coated irregularly.</i>

172
00:07:39,936 --> 00:07:42,272
<i>This is a skill.</i>

173
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:45,008
YOU CAN TELL THAT IT'S CRISPY
WITHOUT EVEN TRYING IT

174
00:07:45,075 --> 00:07:46,243
I'll try it.

175
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:49,145
You can tell it's crispy
just by looking at it.

176
00:07:50,113 --> 00:07:52,449
Isn't it absolutely fantastic?

177
00:07:52,515 --> 00:07:53,550
TOUCHED

178
00:07:53,617 --> 00:07:54,618
It's so tender.

179
00:07:56,486 --> 00:08:02,192
THE CRISPY BATTER
IS STUFFED WITH JUICY TENDERLOIN

180
00:08:03,126 --> 00:08:05,528
CRISPY

181
00:08:06,096 --> 00:08:10,667
SOUNDS OF PEOPLE EATING
CHICKEN TENDERLOIN ALL AROUND

182
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:14,404
CAN'T HELP BUT EXCLAIM AT HOW TASTY IT IS

183
00:08:14,471 --> 00:08:16,439
-It just melts in my mouth.
-Exactly.

184
00:08:16,506 --> 00:08:18,541
THE FOODIE BROTHERS LOVE THE TENDER MEAT

185
00:08:22,078 --> 00:08:24,915
FINISHES THE LAST BITE INSTANTLY

186
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:28,285
Where do you add the seasoning?

187
00:08:28,351 --> 00:08:29,819
-He marinates the chicken.
-Okay.

188
00:08:29,886 --> 00:08:31,955
Oh, it's scrumptious.

189
00:08:32,022 --> 00:08:34,558
You don't even need any sauce.
It's tasty as it is.

190
00:08:34,624 --> 00:08:35,759
I agree.

191
00:08:35,825 --> 00:08:39,396
I also serve chicken tenderloins
at my restaurant.

192
00:08:39,462 --> 00:08:41,498
We grill it over charcoal,

193
00:08:41,565 --> 00:08:44,267
<i>so the moisture is mostly gone afterward.</i>

194
00:08:45,168 --> 00:08:48,972
<i>But if you deep-fry it in batter,</i>
<i>the meat gets steamed inside.</i>

195
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,407
<i>KUSHIKATSU </i>USES HOT OIL

196
00:08:50,473 --> 00:08:54,878
<i>It's extremely crispy outside</i>
<i>and juicy inside.</i>

197
00:08:54,945 --> 00:08:58,381
<i>You can enjoy the crispy texture.</i>

198
00:08:58,448 --> 00:09:00,717
<i>And most of all,</i>
<i>this tenderloin is very tender.</i>

199
00:09:01,151 --> 00:09:03,119
It's perfectly seasoned, so it's tasty.

200
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,055
-Byoungmook?
-Yes.

201
00:09:05,121 --> 00:09:07,857
Aren't you craving something
after eating this?

202
00:09:07,924 --> 00:09:10,794
We need some drinks to go with this.

203
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,698
I'll show you another thing.
What does it say in front of you?

204
00:09:15,332 --> 00:09:18,735
"Sir, please give me a glass of <i>shochu</i>."

205
00:09:19,336 --> 00:09:23,673
There are <i>shochu</i>
that the owner recommends.

206
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:27,110
Since Dujun is a lightweight,
please make him a lemon sour.

207
00:09:27,177 --> 00:09:29,412
-Is there lemon sour here?
-Yes.

208
00:09:30,013 --> 00:09:31,181
I should go "scour" some.

209
00:09:32,616 --> 00:09:35,785
Sir, please give us
three glasses of <i>shochu</i>.

210
00:09:35,852 --> 00:09:38,255
-And one lemon sour.
-He won't even make eye contact.

211
00:09:39,756 --> 00:09:40,957
I'll prepare it.

212
00:09:41,024 --> 00:09:42,492
ORDERED LEMON SOUR AND <i>SHOCHU</i>

213
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,561
Minseong, tell us what lemon sour is.

214
00:09:44,628 --> 00:09:46,196
Okay, let me tell you.

215
00:09:46,263 --> 00:09:50,367
It's like a cocktail where you add
fruit juice or sparkling water to <i>shochu</i>.

216
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:52,602
<i>It's a mild alcoholic drink.</i>

217
00:09:52,669 --> 00:09:55,338
<i>You can enjoy the sweet taste.</i>

218
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,375
MAKES IT RIGHT BEFORE THEIR EYES

219
00:09:58,441 --> 00:09:59,509
It's entertaining.

220
00:09:59,576 --> 00:10:01,878
He squeezes the lemon himself.

221
00:10:01,945 --> 00:10:03,480
SQUEEZES FRESH LEMON FOR THE TANG

222
00:10:04,281 --> 00:10:06,216
He added plenty of lemon juice.

223
00:10:06,283 --> 00:10:08,218
If we don't have lemons, we'll scour some.

224
00:10:08,285 --> 00:10:10,120
-That's why it's called lemon sour?
-Yes.

225
00:10:10,186 --> 00:10:11,354
That's hilarious.

226
00:10:12,355 --> 00:10:16,059
LEMON SOUR FOR DUJUN

227
00:10:16,126 --> 00:10:18,929
What's the difference
between <i>shochu </i>and sake?

228
00:10:18,995 --> 00:10:21,331
-I'm curious, too.
-<i>Shochu </i>is like soju.

229
00:10:21,398 --> 00:10:23,700
And sake is like our <i>cheongju</i>.

230
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:25,435
-I see.
-Right.

231
00:10:25,502 --> 00:10:28,972
You steam the rice and ferment it.

232
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:30,674
We call that <i>cheongju</i>.

233
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:34,811
And soju is made by distilling <i>cheongju</i>.

234
00:10:34,878 --> 00:10:37,647
<i>SHOCHU </i>IS MADE BY DISTILLING <i>CHEONGJU</i>

235
00:10:37,714 --> 00:10:41,117
-Sake is mostly made with rice.
-Right.

236
00:10:41,184 --> 00:10:45,055
-You can make <i>shochu </i>with barley as well.
-And even with sweet potatoes.

237
00:10:45,121 --> 00:10:46,656
-Oh, I see.
-Exactly.

238
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,326
-Whoa, they're all different.
-Yes, they are.

239
00:10:50,026 --> 00:10:54,497
WHAT KIND OF <i>SHOCHU</i>
DID THE OWNER BRING OUT?

240
00:10:55,198 --> 00:10:57,500
THREE TYPES OF <i>SHOCHU</i>

241
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:59,336
-Please tell us about them.
-Sure.

242
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:01,972
-This is barley <i>shochu</i>.
-Okay.

243
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:03,340
<i>It's made from barley,</i>

244
00:11:03,406 --> 00:11:05,642
and we call it J*llypong <i>shochu</i>.

245
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:08,411
-J*llypong?
-You will understand when you try it.

246
00:11:08,478 --> 00:11:11,081
<i>There's a nice aroma</i>
<i>that comes from the barley.</i>

247
00:11:11,147 --> 00:11:14,718
THE FRAGRANCE OF BARELY IS EXCELLENT

248
00:11:14,784 --> 00:11:16,620
This is a unique one.

249
00:11:16,686 --> 00:11:18,889
This is black sugar <i>shochu</i>.

250
00:11:18,955 --> 00:11:22,759
Shochu <i>is usually made with grains,</i>
<i>but this one isn't.</i>

251
00:11:22,826 --> 00:11:26,229
<i>It's made with black sugar</i>
<i>from sugar cane.</i>

252
00:11:27,297 --> 00:11:29,132
It has a clean taste.

253
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:31,534
And this one is sweet potato <i>shochu</i>.

254
00:11:31,601 --> 00:11:33,503
It says "<i>yakiimo</i>" right here.

255
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,171
<i>It means roasted sweet potato.</i>

256
00:11:37,073 --> 00:11:42,679
-It's made from roasted sweet potato.
-It has a slight aftertaste.

257
00:11:42,746 --> 00:11:44,781
<i>-Wow, that's cool.</i>
<i>-Let me pour them for you.</i>

258
00:11:44,848 --> 00:11:46,082
IT HAS A NICE, SWEET AROMA

259
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:48,585
-Thank you.
-Here is Dujun's drink.

260
00:11:48,652 --> 00:11:49,753
Thank you.

261
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:51,788
Who wants the J*llypong one?

262
00:11:51,855 --> 00:11:53,390
-I do.
-Okay.

263
00:11:54,124 --> 00:11:55,525
Here you go.

264
00:11:56,893 --> 00:11:58,929
Wow, thank you.

265
00:11:58,995 --> 00:12:00,130
Here you go.

266
00:12:00,797 --> 00:12:02,399
-Who wants the black sugar one?
-Me.

267
00:12:02,465 --> 00:12:04,067
Okay, you have it. I have diabetes.

268
00:12:04,134 --> 00:12:06,603
HE SUDDENLY REVEALS THAT HE HAS DIABETES

269
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,871
Here you go.

270
00:12:07,938 --> 00:12:09,673
CHOSE THIS FOR MINSEONG'S HEALTH

271
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,143
MINSEONG CHOOSES
THE ROASTED SWEET POTATO <i>SHOCHU</i>

272
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:14,811
Cheers.

273
00:12:14,878 --> 00:12:18,114
-To our health.
-Cheers.

274
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:25,956
TAKING A BITE OF LEFTOVER TENDERLOIN
AFTER A SIP OF BLACK SUGAR <i>SHOCHU</i>

275
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:29,893
WHAT DOES THE BARLEY <i>SHOCHU </i>TASTE LIKE?

276
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,027
Oh, this is nice.

277
00:12:31,728 --> 00:12:34,464
AT A LOSS FOR WORDS

278
00:12:34,531 --> 00:12:37,033
-This is very--
-The aroma is very strong.

279
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,936
It's been a while
since I've enjoyed the scent of alcohol.

280
00:12:40,003 --> 00:12:43,039
-You will still smell it tomorrow morning.
-No way.

281
00:12:45,108 --> 00:12:48,812
There's a nickname
for the <i>shochu </i>that David drank.

282
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:50,547
It's called "the juice of barley."

283
00:12:50,614 --> 00:12:52,215
Oh, barley juice?

284
00:12:52,282 --> 00:12:55,352
That <i>shochu </i>is loaded with barley.

285
00:12:55,418 --> 00:12:58,488
FULL OF REFRESHING BARLEY

286
00:12:58,555 --> 00:13:02,859
I thought the black sugar one would have
a strong aroma, but it doesn't.

287
00:13:02,926 --> 00:13:03,960
It's not too strong.

288
00:13:04,027 --> 00:13:06,363
<i>This one is for people who love to drink.</i>

289
00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:09,532
<i>It has a clean taste</i>
<i>that preserves the alcohol's flavor.</i>

290
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:11,601
How was the sweet potato one?

291
00:13:11,668 --> 00:13:13,203
-I'm curious.
-Same.

292
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:17,173
Let me try the <i>yakiimo shochu </i>again.

293
00:13:18,575 --> 00:13:20,277
Can you smell the roasted aroma?

294
00:13:20,343 --> 00:13:21,411
It's different.

295
00:13:21,845 --> 00:13:25,649
You know that aftertaste you get
when you eat a raw peeled sweet potato.

296
00:13:25,715 --> 00:13:27,651
-Right.
-That sweet taste.

297
00:13:27,717 --> 00:13:31,922
It especially tastes like
a freshly peeled pumpkin sweet potato.

298
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,391
Cheers.

299
00:13:34,925 --> 00:13:38,995
DAVID TRIES THE ROASTED SWEET POTATO
<i>SHOCHU </i>BECAUSE HE'S CURIOUS

300
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:41,097
I totally agree.

301
00:13:41,164 --> 00:13:43,667
Wow, the fragrance is unbelievable.

302
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:45,669
DAVID IS AMAZED SEVERAL TIMES TODAY

303
00:13:45,735 --> 00:13:48,972
<i>We're following the process</i>
<i>of a raw sweet potato being roasted.</i>

304
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:51,608
<i>SHOCHU </i>TASTES LIKE A SWEET POTATO

305
00:13:51,675 --> 00:13:54,244
I was eating something greasy here once,

306
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:59,249
and the owner recommended pairing it
with <i>shochu </i>or soju.

307
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:01,785
I knew he was a true drinker.

308
00:14:02,185 --> 00:14:07,424
The richness of the oil and the fullness
of the <i>shochu </i>pair well together.

309
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,426
Let me give you an example.

310
00:14:09,492 --> 00:14:12,929
It's like when you drink soju
after eating pork belly.

311
00:14:12,996 --> 00:14:14,965
-I see.
-You wash it down with soju.

312
00:14:15,031 --> 00:14:17,167
Dujun, how is the lemon sour?

313
00:14:17,234 --> 00:14:19,769
-It's got a bit of fizz.
-Of course.

314
00:14:19,836 --> 00:14:21,571
It's great with deep-fried food.

315
00:14:21,638 --> 00:14:24,574
The lemon flavor
balances out the greasiness.

316
00:14:24,641 --> 00:14:27,444
<i>It cleanses your palate</i>
<i>so you can move on to the next dish.</i>

317
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,945
IT'S REFRESHING AND FIZZY

318
00:14:29,012 --> 00:14:30,981
The next <i>kushikatsu </i>is ready.

319
00:14:31,047 --> 00:14:33,884
I sprinkled salt on the shrimp,
so just eat it without sauce.

320
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,986
<i>The eggplant is hot, so be careful.</i>

321
00:14:36,052 --> 00:14:37,187
EGGPLANT AND SHRIMP

322
00:14:37,254 --> 00:14:38,889
Wow, it looks incredible.

323
00:14:39,522 --> 00:14:42,425
Dujun, this is my favorite dish here.

324
00:14:42,492 --> 00:14:45,395
-I love the eggplant.
-Okay.

325
00:14:45,462 --> 00:14:48,331
Look at the scoring on this.

326
00:14:48,932 --> 00:14:51,067
-It's finely cut.
-I see.

327
00:14:51,701 --> 00:14:55,505
THE EGGPLANT HAS EXTREMELY FINE CUTS

328
00:14:55,572 --> 00:14:58,375
Sir, why do you make small cuts?

329
00:14:58,942 --> 00:15:02,712
The surface of the eggplant
is harder than you think.

330
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:05,415
It won't cook
if you don't deep-fry it long enough.

331
00:15:05,482 --> 00:15:08,151
<i>But if you make shallow cuts,</i>

332
00:15:08,218 --> 00:15:12,522
<i>it cooks all the way through</i>
<i>in a short amount of time.</i>

333
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:14,324
<i>It cooks thoroughly.</i>

334
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:15,859
IT COOKS THROUGH QUICKLY

335
00:15:17,093 --> 00:15:20,997
DUNKS IT SO THE TOUGH SKIN COOKS EVENLY

336
00:15:21,064 --> 00:15:23,066
And if you look
at the frying batter crumbs,

337
00:15:23,133 --> 00:15:24,968
<i>he used fine crumbs for this one.</i>

338
00:15:25,035 --> 00:15:27,537
<i>-Oh, it's different from the last one.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>

339
00:15:27,604 --> 00:15:29,873
<i>The first one was wet.</i>
<i>This is dry breadcrumbs.</i>

340
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,109
Sir, how many kinds
of breadcrumbs do you use?

341
00:15:33,176 --> 00:15:34,811
-I use three types.
-I see.

342
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:38,148
HE USES THREE TYPES OF BREADCRUMBS

343
00:15:38,215 --> 00:15:40,684
<i>The first one is wet breadcrumbs.</i>

344
00:15:41,718 --> 00:15:43,653
<i>The next one is dry breadcrumbs.</i>

345
00:15:44,621 --> 00:15:48,225
<i>The last one is dry breadcrumbs</i>
<i>mixed with dried shrimp.</i>

346
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:51,094
-Oh, you added shrimp to it?
-Yes.

347
00:15:51,161 --> 00:15:52,829
It enhances the umami and scent.

348
00:15:52,896 --> 00:15:57,300
I added it because the fragrance
is rich and aromatic.

349
00:15:57,867 --> 00:16:01,204
SLIGHTLY DIPS ON ONE SIDE
IN THE BATTER MIX FOR TEXTURE

350
00:16:02,672 --> 00:16:07,377
ADDS SAVORINESS
WITH THE DRIED SHRIMP BREADCRUMBS

351
00:16:18,054 --> 00:16:20,624
EXTREMELY SOFT

352
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,292
Dang, it's sweet.

353
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:24,194
THE EGGPLANT IS SWEET

354
00:16:24,261 --> 00:16:26,296
If you close your eyes when eating this,

355
00:16:26,763 --> 00:16:28,431
it's like you're eating an apple.

356
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:32,002
<i>The juice comes out every time I chew it.</i>

357
00:16:32,068 --> 00:16:35,305
<i>It's the perfect mix</i>
<i>of eggplant juice and oil.</i>

358
00:16:35,372 --> 00:16:37,641
<i>When the eggplant is deep-fried in oil,</i>

359
00:16:37,707 --> 00:16:40,310
<i>it brings out its unique nutty flavor.</i>

360
00:16:40,377 --> 00:16:43,847
<i>And it's important to cook</i>
<i>the eggplant quickly and evenly…</i>

361
00:16:43,914 --> 00:16:45,849
<i>-Definitely.</i>
<i>-…or it will overcook.</i>

362
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,384
<i>It absorbs too much oil.</i>

363
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:49,953
Eggplant is harder to cook than it seems.

364
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,254
Exactly.

365
00:16:51,321 --> 00:16:53,690
Simply put,

366
00:16:53,757 --> 00:16:58,795
this dish is just skewered ingredients
that are deep-fried.

367
00:16:59,663 --> 00:17:03,733
But he's been making <i>kushikatsu</i>
for over ten years.

368
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,237
He told me there's a precise timing
for each ingredient.

369
00:17:07,304 --> 00:17:08,905
He doesn't have an exact recipe.

370
00:17:08,972 --> 00:17:10,774
He learned through experience.

371
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,008
That's awesome.

372
00:17:13,677 --> 00:17:18,715
DEEP-FRIED SHRIMP IS ALSO MADE
WITH HIS SKILLED HANDS

373
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:23,019
HE SPRINKLES ON A BIT OF SALT

374
00:17:23,853 --> 00:17:27,057
HOW DOES IT TASTE?

375
00:17:28,758 --> 00:17:30,860
CRUNCHY

376
00:17:32,629 --> 00:17:35,765
You can cook shrimp by boiling them

377
00:17:35,832 --> 00:17:36,833
"CRISPY"

378
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,201
or grilling it.

379
00:17:38,268 --> 00:17:40,604
-But it's best when it's deep-fried.
-I agree.

380
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,739
It preserves the juice,

381
00:17:42,806 --> 00:17:45,475
and the flesh is super springy.

382
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:46,977
I love the texture.

383
00:17:47,944 --> 00:17:49,312
THE TEXTURE IS INSANE

384
00:17:49,379 --> 00:17:51,948
The batter is not thick.

385
00:17:52,015 --> 00:17:54,584
<i>If it's too thick,</i>
<i>that's all you can taste.</i>

386
00:17:54,651 --> 00:17:55,819
<i>This shrimp stands out.</i>

387
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:01,224
This is the perfect example
of good deep-fried shrimp.

388
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,425
I agree.

389
00:18:02,492 --> 00:18:03,994
-I'm loving this.
-Me too.

390
00:18:04,427 --> 00:18:06,029
Did we eat three skewers so far?

391
00:18:06,663 --> 00:18:08,632
-Am I right?
-That's right.

392
00:18:08,698 --> 00:18:09,866
The ones you've tried

393
00:18:09,933 --> 00:18:14,471
are what the owner usually serves
his customers.

394
00:18:14,537 --> 00:18:17,774
Now he will be serving today's special.

395
00:18:17,841 --> 00:18:19,910
-Is that so?
-Yes.

396
00:18:19,976 --> 00:18:23,113
There's a sense of excitement
while we wait for it.

397
00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:24,347
WHAT WILL BE THE 4TH ONE?

398
00:18:24,414 --> 00:18:25,882
What will be served next?

399
00:18:25,949 --> 00:18:29,085
A MYSTERIOUS INGREDIENT
IS BEING DEEP-FRIED, WITH NO HINTS

400
00:18:30,086 --> 00:18:32,923
THE FOODIE BROTHERS WAIT
FOR FOOD LIKE BABY BIRDS

401
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,759
MESMERIZED

402
00:18:36,459 --> 00:18:40,397
WHAT'S THE NEXT DEEP-FRIED DISH?

403
00:18:40,463 --> 00:18:42,065
The next one is ready.

404
00:18:42,132 --> 00:18:43,366
This is pork loin.

405
00:18:43,433 --> 00:18:45,235
I'll drizzle on sauce for this one.

406
00:18:47,203 --> 00:18:49,372
It's like a pork cutlet skewer.

407
00:18:49,439 --> 00:18:50,907
Dang, I can't wait to try it.

408
00:18:50,974 --> 00:18:52,442
PORK LOIN

409
00:18:52,509 --> 00:18:54,511
This is a special <i>kushikatsu </i>sauce.

410
00:18:54,578 --> 00:18:58,448
Usually, <i>kushikatsu </i>sauce is made
with Worcestershire sauce.

411
00:18:58,515 --> 00:19:03,553
And each restaurant adds its own mix
of secret ingredients to it.

412
00:19:04,487 --> 00:19:06,456
It's like a special sauce.

413
00:19:06,523 --> 00:19:08,992
This restaurant's sauce is quite watery.

414
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:11,494
-Yes, it's light.
-It's light and refreshing.

415
00:19:11,561 --> 00:19:15,632
<i>It's clean and doesn't overpower</i>
<i>the other flavors.</i>

416
00:19:15,699 --> 00:19:17,000
<i>It just slightly seasons it.</i>

417
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:18,868
It's the perfect sauce consistency.

418
00:19:20,136 --> 00:19:24,307
HOW WILL THE DEEP-FRIED PORK LOIN TASTE
WITH THE SAUCE?

419
00:19:24,841 --> 00:19:28,511
BEING FRESHLY DEEP-FRIED
MAKES IT EVEN MORE DELICIOUS

420
00:19:28,578 --> 00:19:31,081
IT'S HOT

421
00:19:36,453 --> 00:19:39,256
HOT FOOD TASTES BEST
WHEN YOU SAVOR THE HEAT

422
00:19:41,157 --> 00:19:42,626
Look at the juice coming out.

423
00:19:43,693 --> 00:19:46,997
BURNED THE ROOF OF HIS MOUTH

424
00:19:47,063 --> 00:19:49,165
I'm obsessed with this.

425
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,768
The pork loin is of high quality.

426
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:55,305
That is why I prepared it tonight.

427
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:57,240
GOOSEBUMPS

428
00:19:57,307 --> 00:20:00,143
-It's a bit different from a pork cutlet.
-I agree.

429
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,112
Wow, it's super juicy.

430
00:20:02,178 --> 00:20:03,179
FEELING MOVED AGAIN

431
00:20:03,947 --> 00:20:06,116
<i>It sure is different from a pork cutlet.</i>

432
00:20:06,182 --> 00:20:08,652
<i>The aroma of the meat comes through more.</i>

433
00:20:08,718 --> 00:20:11,121
<i>It's like a super fancy pork cutlet.</i>

434
00:20:11,187 --> 00:20:13,423
FANCY PORK CUTLET WITH A STRONG MEAT AROMA

435
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:16,359
-You know I run a skewer place.
-Right.

436
00:20:16,426 --> 00:20:18,194
And he also runs a skewer restaurant.

437
00:20:18,261 --> 00:20:21,831
We serve hundreds
of the same skewers to customers,

438
00:20:21,898 --> 00:20:24,634
but the customers only try
that one skewer.

439
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:27,571
So, we have to make each one carefully.

440
00:20:27,637 --> 00:20:29,072
Absolutely.

441
00:20:29,139 --> 00:20:30,640
Within a chunk of meat,

442
00:20:30,707 --> 00:20:33,643
some sections are
more delicious than others.

443
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:37,480
Everything has to be even
so that every bite tastes the same.

444
00:20:37,547 --> 00:20:42,152
So, this is what I always tell my staff,

445
00:20:42,219 --> 00:20:45,355
"That customer is trying our last skewer,

446
00:20:45,422 --> 00:20:47,724
so we're being assessed
by that one skewer."

447
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,492
That's the mindset I try to maintain.

448
00:20:50,126 --> 00:20:52,762
It's hard to stick to that,
even though we know it.

449
00:20:55,098 --> 00:20:57,801
-Is this the last one?
-Yes.

450
00:20:57,867 --> 00:20:59,603
What will be the last one?

451
00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:01,705
WHAT WILL BE THE LAST <i>KUSHIKATSU</i>?

452
00:21:01,771 --> 00:21:04,007
-The last one is ready.
-It's a shiitake mushroom.

453
00:21:05,108 --> 00:21:06,576
The last one is ready.

454
00:21:06,643 --> 00:21:07,978
Here's the shiitake mushroom.

455
00:21:09,112 --> 00:21:10,213
Here is the shiitake mushroom.

456
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,016
THE LAST DISH OF THE OMAKASE:
SHIITAKE MUSHROOM

457
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:16,419
<i>He also coated only one side</i>
<i>with breadcrumbs this time.</i>

458
00:21:16,486 --> 00:21:19,089
APPLIED BREADCRUMBS TO ONE SIDE

459
00:21:19,923 --> 00:21:23,894
ENHANCES THE UMAMI
WITH DRIED SHRIMP BREADCRUMBS

460
00:21:24,461 --> 00:21:27,731
THE SECRET IS TO DEEP-FRY
THE WHOLE MUSHROOM WITHOUT CUTTING IT

461
00:21:27,797 --> 00:21:30,800
When the shiitake mushroom meets the oil,

462
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:32,369
it boosts the fragrance.

463
00:21:32,435 --> 00:21:33,837
INTENSIFIES THE AROMA

464
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,143
I love the scent of the mushroom.

465
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,812
THE FOODIE BROTHERS ARE CAPTIVATED

466
00:21:42,879 --> 00:21:46,483
<i>And the vegetable juice comes out</i>
<i>once you take a bite.</i>

467
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,918
VEGETABLE JUICE SEEPS OUT

468
00:21:47,984 --> 00:21:49,753
It's so chewy. It's like meat.

469
00:21:49,819 --> 00:21:51,521
IT HAS A MEATY TEXTURE

470
00:21:53,256 --> 00:21:56,426
Is there a reason you deep-fry
the whole shiitake mushroom?

471
00:21:56,493 --> 00:21:58,061
You could cut them into pieces.

472
00:21:58,628 --> 00:22:00,864
<i>-First of all, it looks nice.</i>
<i>-Yes, it does.</i>

473
00:22:00,931 --> 00:22:02,599
<i>And like you said,</i>

474
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:06,303
when you cook or apply heat
to sliced vegetables,

475
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:08,071
their juice escapes too quickly.

476
00:22:08,572 --> 00:22:09,906
So, it's not good.

477
00:22:09,973 --> 00:22:11,875
It's better to deep-fry it as a whole.

478
00:22:12,709 --> 00:22:16,947
And you'll know when you take a bite,
since the texture beats sliced ones.

479
00:22:17,814 --> 00:22:19,216
Its texture is better.

480
00:22:19,282 --> 00:22:20,283
CHEWY

481
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:23,320
It locks in the moisture.
That's why it's made this way.

482
00:22:23,386 --> 00:22:24,387
It's excellent.

483
00:22:25,922 --> 00:22:29,226
STARTED WITH CHICKEN TENDERLOIN

484
00:22:30,026 --> 00:22:34,064
ENJOYED JUICY EGGPLANT AND CHEWY SHRIMP

485
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:38,602
FILLED UP ON HEARTY PORK LOIN

486
00:22:39,236 --> 00:22:43,240
WRAPPED IT UP WITH AROMATIC
AND CHEWY SHIITAKE MUSHROOM

487
00:22:44,975 --> 00:22:48,245
THE OMAKASE COURSE IS 14,000 WON
WITH FIVE TYPES OF SKEWERS

488
00:22:48,311 --> 00:22:51,848
-Isn't it time to refresh our palates?
-Of course.

489
00:22:51,915 --> 00:22:53,016
-Sir.
-What is it?

490
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:55,919
-Can we please have cucumber <i>tataki</i>?
-Got it.

491
00:22:55,986 --> 00:22:58,722
-Cucumber <i>tataki</i>?
-What is that?

492
00:22:58,788 --> 00:23:02,192
The owner stopped making this
because it was too hard do to on his own.

493
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:05,161
-But he started making it again.
-It's a nostalgic dish.

494
00:23:05,228 --> 00:23:06,529
It was served in the past.

495
00:23:08,164 --> 00:23:10,634
CUTS THE CUCUMBER

496
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:14,371
ADDS THE SPECIAL SAUCE,
WHICH IS MADE WITH SALT AND CHILI OIL

497
00:23:15,672 --> 00:23:18,642
LIGHTLY MIXES, AND IT'S READY

498
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:19,876
<i>Cucumber </i>tataki<i>.</i>

499
00:23:19,943 --> 00:23:22,445
<i>I served it in two bowls</i>
<i>for your convenience.</i>

500
00:23:22,512 --> 00:23:24,014
<i>-Thank you so much.</i>
<i>-Thank you.</i>

501
00:23:24,581 --> 00:23:27,250
I can tell this will be
absolutely delicious.

502
00:23:32,188 --> 00:23:33,189
YUM

503
00:23:36,626 --> 00:23:37,694
REFRESHING

504
00:23:37,761 --> 00:23:40,497
You need something refreshing
with deep-fried food.

505
00:23:40,564 --> 00:23:42,098
CLEANSES THE PALATE

506
00:23:42,165 --> 00:23:45,168
There's a freshness in chewing
that alcohol can't provide.

507
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:47,771
<i>This chili oil is the game-changer.</i>

508
00:23:47,837 --> 00:23:49,673
<i>I love the seasoning.</i>

509
00:23:49,739 --> 00:23:52,976
<i>-You should order it as a side dish.</i>
<i>-It's like eating kimchi.</i>

510
00:23:53,043 --> 00:23:55,111
A PERFECT PAIRING WITH <i>KUSHIKATSU</i>

511
00:23:55,545 --> 00:23:59,482
I heard that you used to be
an office worker.

512
00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:00,850
That's right.

513
00:24:01,084 --> 00:24:05,488
I majored in statistics
and analyzed data on a computer.

514
00:24:05,555 --> 00:24:07,057
CHEF BYOUNGMOOK'S UNEXPECTED PAST

515
00:24:07,123 --> 00:24:09,626
While I worked at a company,

516
00:24:10,293 --> 00:24:12,362
I realized something.

517
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:14,931
I'm unable to work while seated.

518
00:24:15,699 --> 00:24:17,601
<i>I just can't work sitting still.</i>

519
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:19,669
I NEED TO BE ON MY FEET TO WORK

520
00:24:19,736 --> 00:24:22,005
So, I started looking for what to do.

521
00:24:22,072 --> 00:24:25,709
A friend of mine was planning to open
a restaurant and asked me to join.

522
00:24:25,775 --> 00:24:28,245
So, I actually started
as a French cuisine chef.

523
00:24:28,879 --> 00:24:31,348
CHEF KIM BYOUNGMOOK BEGAN
HIS CAREER AS A CHEF

524
00:24:31,414 --> 00:24:33,250
<i>-You were a French cuisine chef.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

525
00:24:33,316 --> 00:24:36,186
Why did you suddenly
become a yakitori chef?

526
00:24:36,253 --> 00:24:38,288
There's a reason for that.

527
00:24:38,889 --> 00:24:41,892
I chose an ingredient I could cook with.

528
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:43,126
I see.

529
00:24:43,193 --> 00:24:45,595
In French cuisine,
the chicken is prepped daily.

530
00:24:45,662 --> 00:24:49,499
So, I didn't have a problem
with cooking chicken.

531
00:24:50,634 --> 00:24:51,701
So, I chose that.

532
00:24:51,768 --> 00:24:56,606
And I realized I enjoyed
meeting lots of customers.

533
00:24:57,407 --> 00:25:00,076
I found that I liked
serving food over counters.

534
00:25:00,544 --> 00:25:04,447
That's how I started making yakitori
and studying Japanese cuisine.

535
00:25:05,081 --> 00:25:06,349
That's how I got here.

536
00:25:07,951 --> 00:25:12,355
FOCUSED ON HOW PEOPLE COULD
COMFORTABLY ENJOY YAKITORI

537
00:25:13,456 --> 00:25:16,359
HE PROMOTES THE FLAVOR AND BEAUTY
OF KOREAN NATIVE CHICKEN

538
00:25:16,927 --> 00:25:20,263
You're not full yet, are you?

539
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:22,098
-Of course not.
-I thought so.

540
00:25:22,165 --> 00:25:25,368
-How many more can you eat?
-I could eat 20 more.

541
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:28,405
Just because my belly sticks out
doesn't mean I'm full.

542
00:25:32,275 --> 00:25:33,677
THAT'S HILARIOUS

543
00:25:33,743 --> 00:25:34,744
Everyone.

544
00:25:35,879 --> 00:25:38,148
There's also a small menu here.

545
00:25:38,215 --> 00:25:40,350
-Check the ones you want to try.
-Okay.

546
00:25:40,417 --> 00:25:42,886
YOU CAN ALSO ORDER SINGLE DISHES

547
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,488
Is there anything you want to order?

548
00:25:45,555 --> 00:25:47,791
I'll check the ones you want.

549
00:25:47,857 --> 00:25:50,160
-I want the asparagus.
-Okay.

550
00:25:51,661 --> 00:25:53,196
<i>It's like he's deep-frying a bat.</i>

551
00:25:53,263 --> 00:25:55,298
GIGANTIC ASPARAGUS COMING UP

552
00:25:55,699 --> 00:25:57,300
I'd like some pork jowl, please.

553
00:25:58,235 --> 00:26:01,371
ORDERED THE FATTY PORK JOWL

554
00:26:01,438 --> 00:26:04,274
I'll try whatever you recommend.

555
00:26:04,908 --> 00:26:08,278
ORDERED THICK LOTUS ROOT
THAT TODAY'S CHEF RECOMMENDS

556
00:26:08,745 --> 00:26:10,881
WHAT WILL THEY TRY FIRST?

557
00:26:10,947 --> 00:26:12,315
-Here is the asparagus.
-Okay.

558
00:26:12,382 --> 00:26:15,218
-It's thick.
-I sprinkled on some salt, so just enjoy.

559
00:26:15,285 --> 00:26:18,989
MASSIVE ASPARAGUS

560
00:26:19,055 --> 00:26:22,058
-Thank you.
-Wow, I've never had deep-fried asparagus.

561
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:23,560
-Eat it right away.
-Got it.

562
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,731
There's a big difference
between eating it now and later.

563
00:26:29,065 --> 00:26:32,569
<i>In a few minutes,</i>
<i>it will overcook from the residual heat.</i>

564
00:26:32,636 --> 00:26:35,138
IN FIVE MINUTES,
THE TASTE AND TEXTURE WILL CHANGE

565
00:26:36,773 --> 00:26:39,876
CRUNCHY

566
00:26:44,481 --> 00:26:46,816
Wow, this is unbelievably good.

567
00:26:47,717 --> 00:26:49,219
<i>This is top-quality asparagus.</i>

568
00:26:49,286 --> 00:26:50,654
<i>-It's crispy.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>

569
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,855
ASPARAGUS HAS ITS CHARM

570
00:26:51,922 --> 00:26:55,559
It feels like eating
perfectly-cooked peas.

571
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,160
It was fantastic.

572
00:26:59,529 --> 00:27:01,798
The pork jowl is ready.

573
00:27:01,865 --> 00:27:03,333
THE SECOND EXTRA DISH IS HERE

574
00:27:03,967 --> 00:27:05,569
<i>Sir, what is the sauce on top?</i>

575
00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:10,340
<i>-It's a green onion sauce that I made.</i>
<i>-I see.</i>

576
00:27:10,407 --> 00:27:11,408
<i>Please try it.</i>

577
00:27:11,474 --> 00:27:13,376
SAUCE MADE WITH SECRET INGREDIENTS

578
00:27:14,411 --> 00:27:16,379
It's best to eat it with the sauce.

579
00:27:16,446 --> 00:27:18,114
Wow, it's so tender.

580
00:27:19,983 --> 00:27:20,984
YUM

581
00:27:22,986 --> 00:27:24,688
IT'S AMAZING

582
00:27:24,754 --> 00:27:28,458
<i>-Pork jowl has a unique, crunchy texture.</i>
<i>-Absolutely.</i>

583
00:27:28,525 --> 00:27:29,859
<i>It's full of it.</i>

584
00:27:29,926 --> 00:27:31,528
<i>-You can taste the meat juice.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

585
00:27:31,595 --> 00:27:32,963
THE UMAMI FLAVOR IS INTENSE

586
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:35,732
And he placed
the green onion sauce on top.

587
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:37,767
It might've been a bit oily,

588
00:27:37,834 --> 00:27:40,136
<i>but the sauce cuts out the greasiness.</i>

589
00:27:42,272 --> 00:27:44,608
CLEANSES HIS PALATE WITH <i>SHOCHU</i>

590
00:27:44,674 --> 00:27:47,444
-The J*llypong drink.
-This tastes exactly like that.

591
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:50,447
I might get addicted to <i>shochu</i>.

592
00:27:50,513 --> 00:27:51,548
It's so good.

593
00:27:52,682 --> 00:27:55,852
IT ALSO PAIRS WELL
WITH LOW-ALCOHOL LEMON SOUR

594
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,254
This is nice.

595
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,622
<i>Here is the lotus root.</i>

596
00:27:58,688 --> 00:28:00,357
<i>-Thank you.</i>
<i>-It looks mouthwatering.</i>

597
00:28:00,423 --> 00:28:01,791
CHEF'S CHOICE: LOTUS ROOT

598
00:28:01,858 --> 00:28:04,995
Is there a reason the lotus root
is cut into thick pieces?

599
00:28:05,629 --> 00:28:10,634
<i>You can best enjoy the natural texture</i>
<i>of the lotus root this way.</i>

600
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,868
CHEWY YET CRUNCHY

601
00:28:13,136 --> 00:28:15,839
SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE BITING INTO AN APPLE

602
00:28:15,906 --> 00:28:18,141
CRUNCHY

603
00:28:19,175 --> 00:28:20,577
YUM

604
00:28:20,644 --> 00:28:22,379
<i>Once you take a bite of this,</i>

605
00:28:22,445 --> 00:28:26,550
<i>the fibrous texture fills your mouth.</i>

606
00:28:26,616 --> 00:28:30,253
<i>The flavor is somewhere</i>
<i>between a radish and a potato.</i>

607
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,522
<i>It's a bit similar to a mountain yam.</i>

608
00:28:33,123 --> 00:28:34,124
<i>Exactly.</i>

609
00:28:34,925 --> 00:28:38,128
It's nice and crunchy. It's a delicacy.

610
00:28:39,195 --> 00:28:40,897
This is the stuff.

611
00:28:40,964 --> 00:28:42,299
IT'S A RARE DELICACY

612
00:28:43,099 --> 00:28:45,635
Everyone can enjoy it
if it's served like this.

613
00:28:45,702 --> 00:28:46,836
Everyone will love it.

614
00:28:47,437 --> 00:28:48,672
It's a national lotus root.

615
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:50,640
My bad.

616
00:28:50,707 --> 00:28:51,975
THE JOKE FINALLY HIT HIM

617
00:28:52,042 --> 00:28:53,209
I'm not going to laugh.

618
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,149
CHATTING AND ENJOYING <i>KUSHIKATSU </i>TOGETHER

619
00:28:59,216 --> 00:29:02,519
-Dujun, are you full?
-Yes, I am.

620
00:29:02,586 --> 00:29:04,754
-How is everyone?
-Are you full?

621
00:29:04,821 --> 00:29:06,723
-It's time for dessert.
-Really?

622
00:29:07,357 --> 00:29:10,660
-Sounds great.
-Dessert is served in <i>kushikatsu </i>style.

623
00:29:13,163 --> 00:29:14,898
-I'll order right away.
-Sure.

624
00:29:15,699 --> 00:29:18,301
I want three cinnamon apples.

625
00:29:18,368 --> 00:29:19,536
I'll order six.

626
00:29:20,203 --> 00:29:21,204
Hold on.

627
00:29:21,271 --> 00:29:25,342
Oh, one for each of us
and three for Minseong.

628
00:29:25,408 --> 00:29:26,843
Is it that good?

629
00:29:28,378 --> 00:29:29,379
Camembert, please.

630
00:29:29,446 --> 00:29:31,648
ORDERS CINNAMON APPLES
AND CAMEMBERT CHEESE

631
00:29:33,416 --> 00:29:35,585
PREPARING SIX APPLE SLICES RIGHT AWAY

632
00:29:35,652 --> 00:29:37,821
What type of apple are you using?

633
00:29:37,888 --> 00:29:41,091
-I'm using green apples today.
-It's Aori apples.

634
00:29:41,157 --> 00:29:42,292
I love them.

635
00:29:43,627 --> 00:29:46,229
He doesn't just use any type of apple.

636
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:50,533
There are different apples
depending on the season.

637
00:29:51,234 --> 00:29:54,271
TRANSFORMED INTO <i>KUSHIKATSU</i>
COATED WITH DRY BREADCRUMBS

638
00:29:54,938 --> 00:29:59,743
HEAT FROM THE OIL BRINGS OUT
THE AROMA AND FLAVOR

639
00:29:59,809 --> 00:30:02,045
MOUTHWATERING

640
00:30:02,112 --> 00:30:04,214
SUPER EXCITED FOR THE CINNAMON APPLE

641
00:30:04,814 --> 00:30:08,351
ADDS SWEETNESS
TO THE GREEN APPLES WITH HONEY

642
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:13,356
THE PERFECT COMBINATION,
ADDS RICHNESS WITH CINNAMON POWDER

643
00:30:13,423 --> 00:30:16,026
I don't know what it is,
but he's adding a sauce on top.

644
00:30:16,092 --> 00:30:17,594
-What is it?
-It's like a garnish.

645
00:30:19,229 --> 00:30:23,300
FINISHES WITH A TOUCH OF TANGY APPLE JAM
ON TOP OF THE CHEESE

646
00:30:25,068 --> 00:30:26,703
The apples and cheese are ready.

647
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,271
Which one is which?

648
00:30:28,338 --> 00:30:30,507
These are the apples,
and these are the cheese.

649
00:30:31,341 --> 00:30:34,411
CINNAMON APPLE, CAMEMBERT CHEESE

650
00:30:34,477 --> 00:30:35,979
-Thank you.
-It looks awesome.

651
00:30:36,046 --> 00:30:38,615
Let's chat while eating dessert.

652
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:41,885
<i>I want three cinnamon apples.</i>

653
00:30:41,952 --> 00:30:43,954
WHAT DOES THE CINNAMON APPLE TASTE LIKE?

654
00:30:44,554 --> 00:30:46,022
The Aori apples are the best.

655
00:30:46,523 --> 00:30:50,260
-The texture is fantastic.
-I love Aori apples.

656
00:30:50,327 --> 00:30:53,396
When you deep-fry these apples,

657
00:30:53,463 --> 00:30:56,166
they keep their natural acidity.

658
00:30:56,233 --> 00:30:58,201
THE DRY BREADCRUMBS ENHANCE THE ACIDITY

659
00:30:58,268 --> 00:31:01,471
<i>I added honey and cinnamon powder</i>
<i>on the outside.</i>

660
00:31:01,538 --> 00:31:03,039
<i>It all goes well together.</i>

661
00:31:03,106 --> 00:31:04,207
<i>It's way better.</i>

662
00:31:05,976 --> 00:31:11,348
WHAT DOES THE CAMEMBERT CHEESE TASTE LIKE?

663
00:31:11,414 --> 00:31:14,851
<i>I like the bit of jam</i>
<i>on top of the cheese.</i>

664
00:31:14,918 --> 00:31:16,019
<i>It's sweet and salty.</i>

665
00:31:16,086 --> 00:31:18,989
<i>The aromas complement</i>
<i>each other very well.</i>

666
00:31:22,092 --> 00:31:26,363
DAVID TAKES A BITE OF THE CINNAMON APPLE

667
00:31:27,397 --> 00:31:29,666
PICKS THE CAMEMBERT CHEESE NEXT

TAKES A BITE OF THE CAMEMBERT CHEESE

669
00:31:35,538 --> 00:31:37,040
Here's how to enjoy this.

670
00:31:38,341 --> 00:31:40,810
Take a bite of the cheese
and then the apple.

671
00:31:44,414 --> 00:31:45,515
It's tasty together.

672
00:31:45,582 --> 00:31:48,151
WHAT DOES THE COMBINATION TASTE LIKE?

673
00:31:48,218 --> 00:31:50,420
What's your favorite one, sir?

674
00:31:50,487 --> 00:31:51,688
SHAKING AT HOW GOOD IT IS

675
00:31:51,755 --> 00:31:54,958
This cinnamon apple
is absolutely scrumptious.

676
00:31:55,725 --> 00:31:58,628
David told me
to eat a bite of each together.

677
00:31:58,695 --> 00:32:00,964
-It's sweet and salty.
-I see.

678
00:32:01,031 --> 00:32:02,399
It was the perfect pairing.

679
00:32:02,999 --> 00:32:06,670
<i>It's like eating gorgonzola pizza</i>
<i>if you eat them together.</i>

680
00:32:06,736 --> 00:32:08,104
<i>With honey drizzled on top.</i>

681
00:32:09,005 --> 00:32:10,574
Today's food was unbelievable.

682
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,276
-It was excellent.
-The dessert was perfect, too.

683
00:32:13,343 --> 00:32:15,579
I think I ate the most
deep-fried food here.

684
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,949
TODAY'S CHEF IS SATISFIED

685
00:32:19,015 --> 00:32:22,786
What does this go-to spot mean to
Chef Byoungmook, the master of yakitori?

686
00:32:22,852 --> 00:32:24,054
Let me see.

687
00:32:25,255 --> 00:32:28,158
Chefs will agree with what I want to say.

688
00:32:28,225 --> 00:32:32,362
The last meal of the day
is quite important to us.

689
00:32:32,429 --> 00:32:35,265
Yes, the final meal of the day.

690
00:32:35,832 --> 00:32:39,135
This go-to place is like a reward for me.

691
00:32:39,202 --> 00:32:41,338
-A treat for yourself.
-Right.

692
00:32:41,404 --> 00:32:43,440
I don't really care what people say.

693
00:32:44,007 --> 00:32:47,410
It doesn't matter if a place
is famous for this and that.

694
00:32:47,978 --> 00:32:51,815
I just want to eat food
made by someone who understands me.

695
00:32:51,882 --> 00:32:53,617
A MEAL THAT CHEERS ME UP

696
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,719
It's a very special place to me.

697
00:32:58,288 --> 00:33:00,123

00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,893

699
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:04,327
