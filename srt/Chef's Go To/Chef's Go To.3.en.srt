-Wait, this is just a normal building.

45
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:06,560
-There's an old-school eatery here?
-Nothing.

46
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:11,598
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THERE IS
A GO-TO PLACE HERE

47
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:16,303
When I first heard of the place,
I couldn't understand why it was famous.

00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:21,675
This is the place.

52
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,645
-What's this?
-It's a bar?

53
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,114

-A bar?
-Yes, I was shocked.

55
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,984
-There it is.
-It's a bar.

56
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:33,253
-It's a sign!
-We could use that next time.

57
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,656
-It says <i>Chef's Go-To.</i>

PARK JOONWOO, TODAY'S CHEF

71
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,959
Chef, tell us about this place.

72
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,428
-It's called--
-We came in thinking it was a bar.

73
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,263
Yes, the sign says it's a bar.

74
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:20,033
It's a super famous bar in Mangwon-dong,
which has been running for a long time.

75
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,302
The fun thing about Mangwon-dong is

76
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:25,172
that there are people of all ages
and genders here.

77
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:26,340
There's always a line.

78
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:27,574
-For this place?
-Yes.

79
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,710
It's famous
among broadcasting industry people.

80
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,311
-I see.
-They do work dinners here.

81
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,647
-It's my first time here.
-Look here.

82
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,316
-Jeon Doyeon was here.
-I see.

83
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,584
FAMOUS AMONG CELEBRITIES

84
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,720
ACTRESS JEON DOYEON

85
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,122
And Sul Kyunggu has also been here.

86
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,190
ACTOR SUL KYUNGGU

87
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:45,993
-There's Sikyung, too.
-Right.

88
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,494
They're all famous.

89
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:54,001
THE WALL IS FULL OF PICTURES
OF FAMOUS CELEBRITIES

90
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,070
At first, I was taken aback
that this place was a bar.

91
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,973
If we're going to a bar,
will we be drinking?

92
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,009
Absolutely.

93
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,745
-The bar snacks are delicious.
-Right.

94
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,113
If you look at the menu,

95
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:08,849
you can tell they are veterans.

96
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,084
Everything is great here,

97
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:14,621
but if you're hungry and in a hurry,
you should order these two first.

98
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:15,722
Okay.

99
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:19,393
-First, there's deep-fried flounder.
-Deep-fried flounder!

100
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,929
-I like fish.
-Then…

101
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:25,332
You have to eat this.

102
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,568
-You must try the <i>yukjeon.</i>
-Really?

103
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,203
They sell <i>yukjeon </i>here?

104
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:33,841
It's different here.
It isn't like any other bar snacks.

105
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:37,744
-Then, let's order those two.
-Yes, let's order them first.

106
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:40,914
Let's order some drinks
since the food takes a while to come out.

107
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:42,883
-Exactly.
-I recommend drinking first.

108
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:45,752
-A draft beer for me.
-I'll get a 500 ml draft beer.

109
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,754
-Okay.
-I'll have what you're having.

110
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,189
-How about <i>makgeolli?</i>
-Sure.

111
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:53,794
Ma'am, we would like two draft beers
and a bottle of <i>makgeolli, </i>please.

112
00:04:54,294 --> 00:05:00,033
DRAFT BEER THAT LOOKS REFRESHING
AT JUST A GLANCE

113
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:05,072
AND <i>MAKGEOLLI </i>THAT WILL QUENCH YOUR THIRST

114
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,708
Thank you.

115
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:09,543
-We'll start drinking.
-Sure.

116
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,677
SHAKE

117
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,613
But at a bar--

118
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:13,947
-Did you shake it?
-Oh, no!

119
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,349
-Oh, no.
-Hey, you!

120
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:18,151
-It's basic manners.
-You should've asked.

121
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:21,121
You should pour the clear liquor first,
and then shake after.

122
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:25,626
TOP CLEAR LAYER: RICH ALCOHOL
AFTER THE SEDIMENTS SETTLE AT THE BOTTOM

123
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:26,927
TOP CLEAR LAYER
SEDIMENT

124
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:31,231
SIMILAR TO <i>CHEONGJU </i>OR SAKE,
KNOWN FOR ITS NEAT AND CLEAN FLAVOR

125
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:33,333
<i>I like the top clear layer.</i>

126
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,903
I learned how to drink <i>makgeolli</i>
from Chef Park Chanil.

127
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:37,104
-Do you know him?
-Yes.

128
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:42,342
He would say something very cool
while pouring the filtered top portion.

129
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,410
WORDS THAT TOUCHED HIM

130
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,813
He said this is poor people's sake.

131
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,382
TOP LAYER IS POOR PEOPLE'S SAKE

132
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:49,683
But he shook it.

133
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:51,785
He shook off my moment.

134
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,321
I should use that line later.

135
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:56,790
-"Poor people's sake."
-That's right.

136
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:01,929
CHEF JOONWOO DRINKS A GLASS
OF THE TOP CLEAR LAYER OF <i>MAKGEOLLI</i>

137
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,630
-I love it.
-How interesting.

138
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,400
TAEHOON DRINKS A GLASS
OF A PIQUANT SHAKEN <i>MAKGEOLLI</i>

139
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:11,171
DUJUN AND NAMNO ENJOY A GLASS
OF COLD DRAFT BEER

140
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:13,273
Darn, this is good.

141
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:19,146
The beer is amazing.

142
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,582
FIRST DISH AT TODAY'S GO-TO SPOT

143
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:22,716
It's here.

144
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:24,151
-Look at that.
-My gosh.

145
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,353
-Look at that.
-My gosh.

146
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,658
-I just saw it.
-Doesn't it look extraordinary?

147
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,966
COATING THE MASSIVE FLOUNDER
IN BREADCRUMBS

148
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,871
AND THOROUGHLY COATING IT
WITH THE BATTER MIX

149
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:48,509
DUNK IT IN BOILING OIL

150
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:52,446
DEEP-FRY IT UNTIL THE OIL BUBBLES

151
00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:00,120
THEN, THE ABSOLUTELY MIND-BLOWING
DEEP-FRIED FLOUNDER IS COMPLETE

152
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:02,389
It's hard to get a flounder this big.

153
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:04,725
-Aren't they usually this small?
-Yes, about half.

154
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,760
We get our flounders from Jeju Island.

155
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:10,731
Jeju Island's flounders
are fatty and tasty.

156
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,499
-Ma'am…
-My gosh.

157
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,402
-My gosh.
-She pulls it apart with her hands.

158
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:17,538
Ma'am, why are you doing this yourself?

159
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,274
-I want to share the homemade touch.
-I see.

160
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:22,075
It's delicious.

161
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:26,446
I didn't add the sauce so you could savor

162
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,448
-its unique taste.
-Right.

163
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:30,250
NO SAUCE TO BRING OUT THE NATURAL TASTE

164
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:32,219
Thank you for the food, ma'am.

165
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:37,324
When we go to a fine dining restaurant,
the food is often served on small plates.

166
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:41,762
Then, the chef suggests
how to best enjoy the dishes.

167
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,797
Eating the coating and meat
together is best.

168
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:44,932
I see.

169
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:47,568
She tore it apart
so it's easier for us to eat it.

170
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:48,902
Here's my recommendation.

171
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,004
Every dish has

172
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:53,540
-its own unique taste.
-Right.

173
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:54,808
Should we eat it as is?

174
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,844
Salt is the best way to savor its flavor.

175
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,145
-With salt?
-Yes.

176
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:01,014
The soy sauce's umami
could enhance the flavor,

177
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:04,918
or the <i>chogochujang's </i>spicy and sour taste
could enrich the flavor.

178
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:07,788
But if a certain dish is
better than average,

179
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:10,757
then salt will bring out the full flavor.

180
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,426
That bite will be amazing.

181
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,695
SALT ENRICHES THE FLAVOR OF THE FOOD

182
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,496
If you're at a bar,

183
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,966
saltiness improves the taste of alcohol.

184
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,300
-That's right.
-Yes.

185
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:24,204
-When Joonwoo explains things…
-We should definitely eat it with salt.

186
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:25,772
-…I'm drawn in.
-Me too.

187
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,074
-Try it.
-Let's dig in.

188
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,810
-I'll try the tail.
-I'll eat with my hands.

189
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,648
This flounder is so…

190
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,520
I'll eat it as is.

191
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:43,056
DUJUN TAKES A BIG BITE AS WELL

192
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:44,491
The flounder is so…

193
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,029
Gosh, you have to try it with salt.

194
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:57,771
I love the taste of the crispy coating
combined with the salty flesh in my mouth.

195
00:08:57,838 --> 00:08:59,072
-Let's drink.
-Of course.

196
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,274
It's incredible.

197
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,341
IT CALLS FOR A DRINK

198
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:07,748
CAN'T HELP DRINKING WHEN DEEP-FRIED
FLOUNDER GOES PERFECTLY WITH SALT

199
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:11,351
-The flounder is pretty good.
-I agree.

200
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,389
A FLAVOR THAT MAKES THEM EXCLAIM

201
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,124
-Isn't it good?
-Absolutely.

202
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,226
CRUNCH

203
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:22,462
THE FISH EVEN SOUNDS TASTY

204
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:25,499
You may already know,
but fish rots from the innards first.

205
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:28,268
If it's not fresh,
you can't serve fish roe.

206
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:30,737
FLOUNDER ROE IS ENJOYED ONLY WHEN FRESH

207
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:33,240
A flounder this big…

208
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:35,275
-It's like a flatfish.
-Definitely.

209
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:37,578
This comes in three sizes.

210
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:38,645
FISH VARIES IN SIZE

211
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:41,281
They have medium, large, and extra large.

212
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,617
Don't worry about the price.

213
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:45,285
If there are a number of people,

214
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:46,920
-order the extra large.
-Okay.

215
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,256
It's better when pulling it apart
and eating it.

216
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:50,791
-The visuals, too.
-Right.

217
00:09:50,858 --> 00:09:52,192
-And--
-If you're new here…

218
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,095
-Big fish always taste better.
-Exactly.

219
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,400
I think it's my first time trying
deep-fried flounder.

220
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:04,037
Honestly, when eaten like this,
it beats fried chicken.

221
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,339
-Seriously.
-I agree.

222
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:08,208
I like that it's light and mild.

223
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,277
The balance with the coating is nice.

224
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:13,547
-They have fish and chips in Europe.
-That's right.

225
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,249
-But this--
-Look at the thickness.

226
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:18,218
Everyone has different styles
for the batter.

227
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,287
Some use sparkling water. Some use vodka.

228
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:21,788
It depends on the chef.

229
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:25,492
<i>It's far better than that batter.</i>

230
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,060
<i>Just eating the coating…</i>

231
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,096
THIS FLOUNDER OUTSHINES FISH AND CHIPS

232
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:32,466
I like the small bones of deep-fried fish.

233
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:34,234
-I see.
-It's chewy.

234
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,402
Yes, it sure is.

235
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:36,503
SMALL BONES: A DELICACY

236
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,407
Actually, the middle is full of collagen.

237
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:41,508
It's very savory.

238
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:44,311
SUCKING ALL OF THE COLLAGEN
INSIDE THE BONES

239
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:50,350
Look at him.

240
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,418
NAMNO EATS THE HEAD

241
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:52,486
He eats well.

242
00:10:52,553 --> 00:10:54,054
-That's tasty.
-Did you hear that?

243
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:55,389
That's hilarious.

244
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:57,891
-Fish heads are the best.
-Really?

245
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,259
That's why I'm eating it.

246
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,495
I didn't think I'd eat so much. I love it.

247
00:11:01,562 --> 00:11:03,797
-Thank you. It's irresistible.
-Help yourself.

248
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:07,835
-I'll eat the last piece.
-This was so good.

249
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:10,137
It's not the last.
There's still some left.

250
00:11:15,943 --> 00:11:21,882
NAMNO DID NOT LEAVE BEHIND EVEN ONE CRUMB

251
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,719
TIME TO TRY THE NEXT DISH

252
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:27,221
-The <i>yukjeon </i>is here.
-Enjoy.

253
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,856
-Look at the <i>yukjeon.</i>
-Thanks.

254
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,626
-What's this?
-It's their signature dish.

255
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,194
AUNTIE'S SIGNATURE DISH, <i>YUKJEON</i>

256
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:41,835
COATING THE FLOURED MEAT
WITH GOLDEN EGG WASH

257
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:48,308
FRY THEM ONE BY ONE IN PLENTY OF OIL

258
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:54,081
RICHLY FLAVORED <i>YUKJEON </i>IS COMPLETE

259
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:57,251
-Here's how you should eat this.
-Okay.

260
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:58,886
SPECIAL WAY TO EAT THIS HERE

261
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,454
One piece.

262
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:03,724
This is leaf mustard kimchi
and green onion kimchi.

263
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,093
-Wrap them up.
-Got it.

264
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,428
So, it's wrapped in meat.

265
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:10,564
-It sure is.
-Enjoy.

266
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:15,702
THE FIRST WRAP GOES TO CHEF JOONWOO

267
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:18,238
Green onion kimchi.

268
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:20,574
DUJUN TRIES WRAPPING IT THE WAY HE LEARNED

269
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:25,012
CHILLS

270
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,180
It's amazing.

271
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,217
It gave me chills.

272
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:31,451
-Look here.
-Right.

273
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:35,756
NAMNO ALSO TAKES A HUGE BITE

274
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:36,857
It's amazing.

275
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:37,958
-Geez.
-Geez.

276
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,795
CAN'T HELP BUT CLAP FOR THIS MASTERPIECE

277
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:43,730
-Isn't it great?
-Absolutely.

278
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:45,365
STILL SWEPT AWAY BY THE TASTE

279
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,234
But how much is this?

280
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:49,069
It's 28,000 won.

281
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:51,238
-It's pricey.
-I agree.

282
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:54,842
-Everyone says that.
-Really? I'd still eat it.

283
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:57,845
-It's not. It's domestically raised.
-It is?

284
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,580
-Of course.
-Okay.

285
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:00,848
And it's served again.

286
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,283
-We get another serving?
-Yes.

287
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,451
This isn't the end.

288
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:07,187
There will be about two pieces left
when the meat goes cold.

289
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:11,658
Then, they serve another plate.
It gets hard if it's served all at once.

290
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:13,193
-It's not good.
-I see.

291
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,628
IN AWE

292
00:13:14,695 --> 00:13:16,563
It's not as tasty when served all at once.

293
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,866
They serve it separately…

294
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:20,234
-Right.
-…in two plates.

295
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,535
So we start drinking again.

296
00:13:21,602 --> 00:13:23,537
-That's good value for money.
-Exactly.

297
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:26,540
-In our restaurants, we emphasize…
-Right.

298
00:13:26,607 --> 00:13:28,675
-…hospitality.
-That's right.

299
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:29,977
When people come to eat,

300
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:34,648
they should eat the best food
and have the best experience.

301
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:37,217
This Mangwon-dong bar offers that.

302
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:40,787
I really respect that about this place.

303
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:43,490
I get chills
when I eat something delicious.

304
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:46,393
-You're a true gourmet.
-From the flounder to this,

305
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,529
it's making my taste buds dance.

306
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:50,330
Not only the <i>yukjeon,</i>

307
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:53,367
but the leaf mustard kimchi is fantastic.

308
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,702
Ma'am, do you order
the kimchi from somewhere?

309
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:58,138
-I make it myself.
-You do?

310
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:00,374
I ferment it for a year after making it.

311
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,677
Did you write that?
"Kimchi is served only with <i>yukjeon."</i>

312
00:14:03,744 --> 00:14:05,445
-I wrote that.
-I see.

313
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,047
Because everyone wanted it.

314
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:09,082
-Got it.
-The kimchi is so good.

315
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:14,922
LEAF MUSTARD KIMCHI AND GREEN ONION KIMCHI
ARE SERVED ONLY WITH <i>YUKJEON</i>

316
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:19,526
AFTER BEING FERMENTED FOR A YEAR,
THE HANDMADE KIMCHI BECOMES RICH IN UMAMI

317
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:26,567
WHAT DOES GOOD KIMCHI REMIND KOREANS OF?

318
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:30,237
-I want to have <i>ramyeon </i>with this.
-I'm craving <i>ramyeon </i>again.

319
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:32,139
It's perfect with just plain rice.

320
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:34,875
This kimchi is so tasty
that we don't need meat.

321
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:38,445
I could eat just kimchi and <i>makgeolli</i>
for four hours<i>.</i>

322
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,416
-This is hard to resist.
-Yes.

323
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:43,784
-It's insane.
-I agree.

324
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:44,852
-Irresistible.
-Yes.

325
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:45,953
HER KIMCHI IS SO GOOD

326
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,254
It's even dangerous.

327
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:50,090
<i>YUKJEON </i>AND KIMCHI

328
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:54,761
THERE'S ANOTHER
UNBELIEVABLE PAIRING LIKE THIS ONE

329
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:56,997
<i>When did you two first meet?</i>

330
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:59,533
-It's been about ten years.
-More than that.

331
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,834
-That long?
-Really?

332
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,837
We met about 12 years ago.

333
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:07,140
<i>Joonwoo was working in Seochon,</i>

334
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:10,811
<i>and I was working as the head chef</i>
<i>at a Chinese restaurant there.</i>

335
00:15:10,878 --> 00:15:14,748
I wanted to be friends with him,
but no chances came up.

336
00:15:14,815 --> 00:15:17,718
One day, I got a lemon tart
from his place.

337
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:19,653
It was scrumptious.

338
00:15:20,554 --> 00:15:25,158
I bought about four or five,
and I ate two on the spot.

339
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:28,362
And I would freeze the rest at home.

340
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:34,601
IT WAS A SMALL LUXURY THAT BROUGHT TAEHOON
HAPPINESS WHEN HE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH

341
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:36,236
I have a similar story.

342
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:40,174
I took poet Kim Minjeong and writer Choi
Minjeong to your first restaurant, Aryang.

343
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,241
That's right.

344
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:43,877
-I brought all my friends to try his food.
-Really?

345
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:47,214
You both fell in love
with each other's food.

346
00:15:48,582 --> 00:15:51,618
THEY FELL FOR EACH OTHER'S COOKING
AND BECAME FRIENDS

347
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:54,454
We've been friends ever since.

348
00:15:55,222 --> 00:16:00,194
We became close,
and he taught me about wine.

349
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,530
Whenever we drink wine together,

350
00:16:03,597 --> 00:16:05,666
he insists on having
Bourgogne Pinot Noir only.

351
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,602
Joonwoo taught me how to drink wine.

352
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:11,405
We would drink blended wine at first.

353
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,873
After three years,

354
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,276
he brought a very expensive Pinot Noir
and let me try it.

355
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:17,344
Hear me out.

356
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:21,048
-That was the best wine I've ever tasted.
-I see.

357
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:23,050
You didn't appreciate good wine at first.

358
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:26,987
So, we started off with a moderate wine
so he could learn about good wine.

359
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:29,089
That's when I fell for Pinot Noir.

360
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:31,959
When he drinks good wine,
he thinks it's Pinot Noir.

361
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:38,432
-Stop it.
-Teasing Taehoon is what I live for.

362
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:42,503
-He's adorable.
-Exactly. He's cute for his age.

363
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:48,308
WISHING THEM A LASTING FRIENDSHIP

364
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:51,078
I would probably--

365
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:53,447
-Wait, there's more?
-Here you go.

366
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:56,116
SECOND DISH OF <i>YUKJEON </i>IS SERVED

367
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:59,486
Cut the <i>yukjeon </i>in half.
You know how to eat it.

368
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:01,288
Help yourself with a big wrap.

369
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:03,190
You purposely did that for us.

370
00:17:03,257 --> 00:17:04,892
AUNTIE'S WARM THOUGHTFULNESS

371
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:08,095
The chefs have to suggest the best way…

372
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:10,163
-I see.
-…to eat this.

373
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:14,468
The best pair is ordering food
and having someone else pay for it.

374
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:17,704
That's the best saying ever.

375
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:19,473
The owner already paired the food.

376
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,841
-It's a hard task.
-Right.

377
00:17:20,908 --> 00:17:23,410
-It sure is.
-It could backfire.

378
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:25,245
Then, let's have a two-on-two match.

379
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:26,313
-Two-on-two?
-Yes.

380
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:27,881
TEAM BEER VS TEAM <i>MAKGEOLLI</i>

381
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:30,517
FORMED TEAMS BASED ON THEIR DRINKS

382
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:32,653
-Who will be the judge?
-Sorry?

383
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,054
Should we ask a customer?

384
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:35,889
-Let's do it.
-They have to try it.

385
00:17:35,956 --> 00:17:38,358
-The most famous chef should go.
-Of course.

386
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:40,861
-Ask them to become our judges.
-Me?

387
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:42,663
-Yes.
-Those two ladies.

388
00:17:43,297 --> 00:17:44,498
-You should explain…
-Sure.

389
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:48,135
-Go explain it to them.
-Yes, I'll do it.

390
00:17:48,936 --> 00:17:51,572
We will give you a bite of each food pair.

391
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:52,806
Okay.

392
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:54,775
-You just have to pick the loser.
-Sure.

393
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:56,610
Then, what will be the penalty?

394
00:17:56,677 --> 00:17:58,312
-Paying for the whole bar.
-My gosh.

395
00:17:58,378 --> 00:17:59,513
-Sorry?
-That's brutal.

396
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,449
-Pick up the tab.
-How about buying a dish for everyone?

397
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:03,684
-That sounds good.
-Yes.

398
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,785
-Deal.
-Let's go.

399
00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:05,953
-Deal?
-Good luck.

400
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:07,521
-Deal.
-My gosh.

401
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:09,690
I'll go first.

402
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:10,757
-Really?
-Yes.

403
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:14,361
-Can we have rice and sesame oil, please?
-I'm so full.

404
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:17,030
I'm counting on you.

405
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:18,498
-Don't worry.
-Are you sure?

406
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:19,600
CONFIDENT

407
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:20,934
Using carbs is a killer move.

408
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:23,937
That's not so nice.

409
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:26,673
Do you have carbs in yours?

410
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,774
No.

411
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:29,343
-We're doomed.
-This is hilarious.

412
00:18:29,743 --> 00:18:30,878
Let's go.

413
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,179
NAMNO'S PAIR

414
00:18:32,246 --> 00:18:33,280
Put rice on <i>yukjeon.</i>

415
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:34,381
1. RICE ON <i>YUKJEON</i>

416
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:36,183
Drizzle some sesame oil.

417
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,252
2. DRIZZLE SESAME OIL ON TOP

418
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:39,319
Just a bit.

419
00:18:40,654 --> 00:18:43,223
-Add wasabi soy sauce?
-Yes, since the meat is oily.

420
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,659
It kind of looks like beef sushi.

421
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:47,661
Drizzle some more.

422
00:18:47,728 --> 00:18:49,563
-What do you mean?
-Soy sauce.

423
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:51,231
I'll take care of it.

424
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:52,299
LEAVE ME ALONE

425
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,268
Chef Namno is doing great.

426
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,103
I'LL SEE IF YOURS TASTES GOOD

427
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,138
Add leaf mustard kimchi.

428
00:18:58,205 --> 00:18:59,239
LEAF MUSTARD KIMCHI

429
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:01,175
-It looks insane.
-It's mouth-watering.

430
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:02,643
Of course, that's good.

431
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:04,011
Since the judges are ladies,

432
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:05,078
"CARING ABOUT PLATING"

433
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,247
it should look nice and be easy to eat.

434
00:19:08,382 --> 00:19:11,718
WRAPPING IT CAREFULLY

435
00:19:12,553 --> 00:19:15,689
SECURING THE FOOD NICELY WITH A TOOTHPICK

436
00:19:15,756 --> 00:19:16,757
There you go.

437
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:19,293
But it looks like it will fall apart.

438
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,794
I shouldn't give him advice.

439
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,463
-It's a competition.
-To distract him?

440
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:26,967
HE DOESN'T CARE
AND TRIES HIS BEST TO FINISH

441
00:19:27,034 --> 00:19:28,101
There.

442
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:30,737
Okay, I'm ready.

443
00:19:31,605 --> 00:19:33,307
I just made this.

444
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,209
-Eat it in one bite.
-Okay.

445
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:37,544
-Will it be possible? Like this.
-Yes.

446
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:39,079
Hurry, try it.

447
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,215
Right now.

448
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:42,382
-Gosh.
-It'll fall apart.

449
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:43,784
CAN THEY EAT IT IN ONE BITE?

450
00:19:44,585 --> 00:19:45,619
EYES CLOSED

451
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:47,354
Is it too big for them?

452
00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:49,423
-It is.
-Oh, no.

453
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:50,757
I'm so sorry.

454
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,294
-It should've been half that size.
-He doesn't know what women want.

455
00:19:55,729 --> 00:19:58,899
-Hold on--
-He devoted his life entirely to cooking.

456
00:19:58,966 --> 00:20:00,267
I made it to fit my mouth.

457
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:02,236
-It's too big?
-Yes.

458
00:20:02,903 --> 00:20:03,904
Are you okay?

459
00:20:03,971 --> 00:20:05,305
THE JUDGE WIPES HER MOUTH

460
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:06,640
-She doesn't seem okay.
-Wait.

461
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:09,476
-Okay.
-It's my turn.

462
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:10,711
NEXT UP IS TAEHOON

463
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:11,778
The <i>yukjeon…</i>

464
00:20:12,346 --> 00:20:14,581
Ma'am, excuse me.

465
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:17,317
Do you have some shredded cabbage?

466
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:19,887
When you go to fried chicken places,
they serve cabbage

467
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:21,088
"MIX <i>CHOJANG, </i>CABBAGE"

468
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:23,423
-with ketchup and mayo.
-That's right.

469
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,758
Like that,

470
00:20:24,825 --> 00:20:27,728
mix just a bit of <i>chojang</i>
with the shredded cabbage.

471
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:30,197
1. ADD A BIT OF <i>CHOJANG</i>
TO SHREDDED CABBAGE

472
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:33,667
Without hiding the color of the cabbage.

473
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:37,304
2. ADD THE CABBAGE ON TOP OF THE <i>YUKJEON</i>

474
00:20:39,206 --> 00:20:41,041
This might be too big for a bite.

475
00:20:41,108 --> 00:20:42,409
TAEHOON TRIES TO WRAP IT

476
00:20:42,476 --> 00:20:43,810
This is hard.

477
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:46,780
HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW HARD IT WAS
WHEN HE WAS TEASING NAMNO

478
00:20:46,847 --> 00:20:49,183
-Do I feed it to them?
-Yes, it's better that way.

479
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:50,250
It doesn't wrap nicely.

480
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:53,620
TAEHOON'S WRAP FALLS APART EVENTUALLY

481
00:20:53,687 --> 00:20:55,822
Excuse me. Let me feed you

482
00:20:55,889 --> 00:20:57,357
"HE GOES TO FEED THEM HIMSELF"

483
00:20:57,424 --> 00:20:59,426
-with my chopsticks.
-Okay.

484
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:01,662
TAKING A BITE

485
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:02,729
That's it.

486
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,237
The ladies might like it
because it tastes lighter.

487
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:12,239
Wasn't this one easier?

488
00:21:12,306 --> 00:21:13,307
All right.

489
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,542
SURPRISED

490
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:19,413
IS THAT A NOD OF APPROVAL?

491
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:21,081
They're loving it.

492
00:21:21,148 --> 00:21:23,250
Cabbage with <i>chojang </i>is too familiar.

493
00:21:24,218 --> 00:21:25,752
It's the same for rice with kimchi.

494
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:29,723
-You're ridiculous.
-He's right.

495
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,891
A FIERCE AND TIGHT MATCH

496
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,594
-It's going to be close.
-Do you have the winner?

497
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,296
-Please think it over.
-Yes, tell us your decision.

498
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:39,933
-We have to brace ourselves.
-The bill is huge this time.

499
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,168
So, who is the winner?

500
00:21:41,235 --> 00:21:42,236
WHICH TEAM WILL PAY?

501
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,104
Me?

502
00:21:44,171 --> 00:21:45,272
NAMNO'S TEAM WINS!

503
00:21:45,706 --> 00:21:48,008
All right. He's going to treat
everyone to a dish.

504
00:21:48,075 --> 00:21:50,277
-Where's the menu?
-Wait, why did you choose him?

505
00:21:50,344 --> 00:21:51,678
WHAT IS THEIR REASON?

506
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:54,314
I could only taste the <i>yukjeon.</i>

507
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:55,582
Really?

508
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:57,918
The one with kimchi was refreshing.

509
00:21:57,985 --> 00:22:00,053
Then doesn't it only taste like kimchi?

510
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,688
Let's try again with someone older.

511
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:02,756
GETTING WHINY

512
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,360
-Your food is a bit bland.
-Really?

513
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:07,461
It's under seasoned.

514
00:22:09,096 --> 00:22:11,131
SIGH

515
00:22:11,198 --> 00:22:14,067
The cuttlefish is the most expensive,
so try that.

516
00:22:14,134 --> 00:22:16,069
One order of cuttlefish here, please.

517
00:22:16,136 --> 00:22:19,339
We'd like to pay
for five bottles of soju in advance.

518
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:20,407
Deep-fried flounder.

519
00:22:20,941 --> 00:22:23,377
Deep-fried fatsia shoots
for this table, please.

520
00:22:23,443 --> 00:22:27,214
It feels nice to show off
with someone else's money.

521
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:33,420
ROOTING FOR CHEF TAEHOON TO WIN ONE DAY

522
00:22:33,487 --> 00:22:36,223
Can we get
deep-fried fatsia shoots, please?

523
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,624
They have that here?

524
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:42,663
You can see
that there's a chalkboard on each side.

525
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:44,298
They have special menus here.

526
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:47,201
The flounder says it all.
They're experts in fried food.

527
00:22:47,267 --> 00:22:48,802
-You know fatsia shoots?
-Yes.

528
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:50,370
-I think they use them.
-I see.

529
00:22:50,437 --> 00:22:52,773
I'm curious how the eggplant balls taste.

530
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,842
I go crazy for chilled acorn jelly soup.

531
00:22:54,908 --> 00:22:57,177
-Can we order spicy braised pork ribs?
-Yes.

532
00:22:57,244 --> 00:22:58,512
We'll have that.

533
00:22:58,579 --> 00:22:59,947
I'm stuffed.

534
00:23:00,013 --> 00:23:02,416
This is common among chefs.

535
00:23:03,317 --> 00:23:04,751
Even though they're full,

536
00:23:04,818 --> 00:23:08,121
they're ordering more because they want
to try good food and learn from it.

537
00:23:08,188 --> 00:23:10,524
They want to order
various dishes to learn.

538
00:23:10,591 --> 00:23:13,827
-Chef Taehoon is eager to learn.
-He's already tried some dishes.

539
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:15,229
Exactly.

540
00:23:15,295 --> 00:23:16,964
It was good from the start.

541
00:23:17,631 --> 00:23:23,203
I feel like whatever I order
will be above average.

542
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,638
I'm excited.

543
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:27,541
It's not a typical bar. It's a restaurant.

544
00:23:27,608 --> 00:23:29,142
I forgot this was a bar.

545
00:23:29,209 --> 00:23:30,544
HE FORGOT IT WAS A BAR

546
00:23:31,345 --> 00:23:37,718
THIS PLACE SERVES FOOD LOVED BY MANY

547
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:44,191
THIS GO-TO PLACE IS
THE BEST PLACE TO LEARN FOR CHEFS

548
00:23:44,258 --> 00:23:45,292
Do you want more?

549
00:23:46,493 --> 00:23:51,498
GAINING KNOWLEDGE
WITH A MEAL AT MY GO-TO PLACE

550
00:23:52,332 --> 00:23:55,802
My go-to place not only has
to have delicious food,

551
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:58,972
but I need to make sure
that I enjoy the food comfortably.

552
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,107
Right.

553
00:24:00,174 --> 00:24:01,542
When you're working,

554
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:04,811
whether you're the boss,
an employee, or a freelancer,

555
00:24:04,878 --> 00:24:07,181
you can't help but become uptight
as you try to balance

556
00:24:07,247 --> 00:24:08,782
-work and relationships.
-I agree.

557
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,385
When I come to a place like this,

558
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:15,222
I become less uptight.

559
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:16,423
I see.

560
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:20,294
It's a place
that makes me feel comfortable.

561
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,564
Not only do the customers have to open up,

562
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:29,002
but the owners also have
to open up to the customers.

563
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:31,371
-Yes.
-That's how they get regulars

564
00:24:31,438 --> 00:24:34,374
who will continue to come for a long time.

565
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:38,111
A PLACE THAT OFFERS COMFORT
AFTER A LONG DAY

566
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:41,448
A SPOT THAT SOOTHES EVERYONE'S HEART

567
00:24:42,382 --> 00:24:45,085
YOUR VERY OWN GO-TO PLACE

568
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:47,321
Something just popped into my head.

569
00:24:47,387 --> 00:24:50,224
The owner of this place
is also very lucky.

570
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:55,295
Being considerate is very important
for a restaurant to become a go-to place.

571
00:24:55,362 --> 00:24:59,066
But this consideration is
not only limited from owners to customers.

572
00:24:59,132 --> 00:25:00,234
That's right.

573
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,269
Only customers who respect the owner

574
00:25:02,336 --> 00:25:03,904
-can be regulars.
-Absolutely.

575
00:25:03,971 --> 00:25:07,708
Being considerate of one another
and looking after this place

576
00:25:07,774 --> 00:25:10,978
as a drinker and a customer
or as a business owner is

577
00:25:11,044 --> 00:25:13,447
how you become a go-to spot or a regular.

578
00:25:13,547 --> 00:25:16,149
-…a go-to spot or a regular.
-He's so well-spoken.

579
00:25:17,317 --> 00:25:19,419
Only then will you find
three go-to places.

580
00:25:19,486 --> 00:25:20,988
Only three in one's life?

581
00:25:21,054 --> 00:25:22,322
This is one of them.

582
00:25:22,923 --> 00:25:26,260
I've never seen him speak
this highly of a place.

583
00:25:26,326 --> 00:25:27,895
The first since Doryang.

584
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:29,763
This place came first, then Doryang.

585
00:25:30,964 --> 00:25:32,432
-Besides my restaurant…
-Yes.

586
00:25:32,499 --> 00:25:35,068
…I've never heard you compliment a place.

587
00:25:35,135 --> 00:25:36,436
-Are you bragging?
-Of course.

588
00:25:36,503 --> 00:25:37,704
HE'S SHOWING OFF

589
00:25:37,771 --> 00:25:39,873
Let's wrap things up since we're shooting…

590
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,942
-Sure.
-…and go have fun after.

591
00:25:42,009 --> 00:25:43,343
-More drinks.
-Good work.

592
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,845
-Thanks, Chef.
-Well done.

593
00:25:44,912 --> 00:25:47,447
ENDING TODAY LAUGHING
AT CHEF PARK JOONWOO'S GO-TO SPOT

594
00:25:47,781 --> 00:25:50,851
YOU AND I BAR
