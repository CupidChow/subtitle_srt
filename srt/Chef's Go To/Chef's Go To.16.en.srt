1
00:00:01,878 --> 00:00:04,714
<i>Where are we today?</i>
<i>I've never been here before.</i>

2
00:00:04,781 --> 00:00:09,419
<i>During the Joseon dynasty,</i>
<i>the officers would patrol these grounds.</i>

3
00:00:09,486 --> 00:00:11,288
<i>-They patrolled this road.</i>
<i>-I see.</i>

4
00:00:12,522 --> 00:00:17,060
TRANSFORMED INTO A UNIQUE PLACE
WITH CAFES AND BARS

5
00:00:17,127 --> 00:00:20,230
<i>I definitely see</i>
<i>a lot of young people here.</i>

6
00:00:20,297 --> 00:00:22,132
<i>-Tourists as well.</i>
<i>-Yes, I agree.</i>

7
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:24,768
TODAY, THEY'VE COME TO SEOSULLA-GIL

8
00:00:24,834 --> 00:00:29,372
The people passing us by
seem to all be very young.

9
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,408
-It's a hot spot.
-Yes.

10
00:00:31,474 --> 00:00:34,844
-I don't think we belong here.
-Me neither.

11
00:00:34,911 --> 00:00:37,080
I think there's a high possibility

12
00:00:37,614 --> 00:00:41,251
that today's chef will be
on the younger side.

13
00:00:41,318 --> 00:00:45,088
-I invited today's chef.
-I see.

14
00:00:45,155 --> 00:00:46,990
-She's young.
-Really?

15
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:51,661
FIRST HINT FOR TODAY'S CHEF: ZILLENNIAL

16
00:00:51,728 --> 00:00:55,065
<i>-But her food tastes like grandma's food.</i>
<i>-Oh, that's funny.</i>

17
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:57,701
-She runs her restaurant nearby.
-Okay.

18
00:00:57,767 --> 00:00:59,803
It's a go-to spot for celebrities.

19
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:03,373
<i>-Is that so?</i>
<i>-Yes, she's the chef of that place.</i>

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,509
ANOTHER HINT: SHE RUNS A RESTAURANT
THAT'S POPULAR AMONG CELEBRITIES

21
00:01:06,576 --> 00:01:07,744
I wonder who it is.

22
00:01:07,811 --> 00:01:10,714
-I have no clue.
-Me neither.

23
00:01:11,381 --> 00:01:14,484
-Where are you going?
-Hold on.

24
00:01:15,085 --> 00:01:17,020
What are you doing here?

25
00:01:17,087 --> 00:01:18,488
-It's Chef Cho.
-Hello.

26
00:01:18,555 --> 00:01:20,891
-How have you been?
-Great to see you.

27
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,694
A YOUNG CHEF SPECIALIZING
IN KOREAN CUISINE

28
00:01:24,761 --> 00:01:28,431
SHE EVEN CAPTIVATES GOURMETS

29
00:01:28,498 --> 00:01:32,602
A YOUNG GENIUS RESTAURANTEUR

30
00:01:32,669 --> 00:01:35,138
CHO SEOHYEONG
KOREAN CUISINE CHEF AND ENTREPRENEUR

31
00:01:35,205 --> 00:01:37,774
-How have you been?
-Great, how about you?

32
00:01:37,841 --> 00:01:40,043
-It's been a while.
-Yes, it has. Hello.

33
00:01:40,777 --> 00:01:43,046
He's awkward with the younger generation.

34
00:01:43,113 --> 00:01:45,916
I don't know how to talk to her.

35
00:01:45,982 --> 00:01:47,350
How do you know each other?

36
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:52,956
Of course, we've known each other
from shooting <i>Culinary Class Wars</i>.

37
00:01:53,023 --> 00:01:55,559
-But she was famous even before that.
-Right.

38
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,260
Chef Cho and I were on a show

39
00:01:57,327 --> 00:02:00,931
that spent three months
hunting for famous restaurants.

40
00:02:00,997 --> 00:02:03,533
-Oh, were you on a show together?
-Yes.

41
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,702
-We ate tons of food.
-We sure did.

42
00:02:06,536 --> 00:02:08,905
-Let's get going.
-Sure.

43
00:02:08,972 --> 00:02:10,473
Off we go.

44
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:14,711
I think we will be having
Western food today.

45
00:02:14,778 --> 00:02:16,479
-You think so?
-Maybe pasta?

46
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,149
We have never had
Western food on this show.

47
00:02:19,216 --> 00:02:21,585
-Not even once.
-Exactly.

48
00:02:21,651 --> 00:02:24,254
-It's always been Korean food.
-We have to eat pizza.

49
00:02:24,321 --> 00:02:25,622
-Let's get pizza.
-Yes.

50
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:27,958
-Let's have pizza with cola.
-Seohyeong?

51
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:31,027
-Are we having Western food today?
-Unfortunately, no.

52
00:02:31,094 --> 00:02:32,395
GIVES A FIRM ANSWER

53
00:02:33,463 --> 00:02:37,534
-Oh, this is the place.
-Really? It's called "Sulla-gil."

54
00:02:37,601 --> 00:02:40,804
<i>-Wait, isn't that the road name here?</i>
-Yes.

55
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,706
SULLA-GIL

56
00:02:42,772 --> 00:02:44,708
-Let's go inside.
-Sure.

57
00:02:44,774 --> 00:02:46,209
CHEF'S GO-TO

58
00:02:46,276 --> 00:02:47,744
Hello, sir.

59
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:49,512
-Hello.
-How's it going?

60
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:52,148
LEE SEOGU
OWNER OF SULLA-GIL FOR 37 YEARS

61
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:53,583
Thanks for having us today.

62
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,418
SHE'S A TRUE REGULAR HERE

63
00:02:55,485 --> 00:02:58,255
-Do you come here a lot?
-I've been coming here for years.

64
00:02:58,321 --> 00:03:00,523
Hold on!

65
00:03:03,326 --> 00:03:05,829
FERMENTED SKATE

66
00:03:05,896 --> 00:03:07,597
I'm in big trouble today.

67
00:03:07,664 --> 00:03:09,599
-Are you afraid to come in?
-Oh, no.

68
00:03:10,367 --> 00:03:13,637
FERMENTED SKATE THAT FRIGHTENS DUJUN

69
00:03:13,703 --> 00:03:17,140
MADE BY FERMENTING FRESH SKATE

70
00:03:17,207 --> 00:03:22,112
IT'S A HIT OR MISS
BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE SCENT

71
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:25,482
TAKEN ABACK BY THE SMELL
EVEN BEFORE TASTING IT

72
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:28,218
-I can't think straight.
-Are you okay?

73
00:03:28,285 --> 00:03:29,386
His eyes are red.

74
00:03:29,452 --> 00:03:31,254
This is what I'm talking about.

75
00:03:31,321 --> 00:03:32,322
This is the stuff.

76
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:35,592
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO DUJUN?

77
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,329
-I've got to give it a try.
-Of course.

78
00:03:39,396 --> 00:03:41,431
Then, do we go upstairs?

79
00:03:41,498 --> 00:03:43,967
-Yes, please.
-Got it.

80
00:03:44,034 --> 00:03:46,503
-I can't wait.
-Fermented skate…

81
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,804
<i>There is a second floor.</i>

82
00:03:47,871 --> 00:03:49,272
<i>The restaurant is nice.</i>

83
00:03:49,339 --> 00:03:52,876
THEY CLIMB THE STAIRS

84
00:03:53,677 --> 00:03:57,214
AND ARE MET WITH A BEAUTIFUL VIEW
OUTSIDE THE WINDOW

85
00:03:57,781 --> 00:03:59,449
What should we order?

86
00:03:59,516 --> 00:04:01,718
-First…
-Since it's the four of us…

87
00:04:01,785 --> 00:04:03,520
-Let's order the <i>samhap</i>.
-Of course.

88
00:04:03,587 --> 00:04:04,921
Four servings of that.

89
00:04:04,988 --> 00:04:08,358
4 SERVINGS OF <i>SAMHAP </i>FOR 160,000 WON

90
00:04:08,425 --> 00:04:11,161
<i>We'll definitely order that.</i>
<i>The steamed skate is also great.</i>

91
00:04:11,228 --> 00:04:12,762
-I'm down.
-Me too.

92
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:14,130
We need to try it.

93
00:04:14,197 --> 00:04:15,632
NEWBIE DUJUN IS NERVOUS

94
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:17,634
You sweat whenever we talk about it.

95
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:19,102
No, I'm all right.

96
00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:21,104
That's the only thing on the menu.

97
00:04:21,171 --> 00:04:23,540
FERMENTED SKATE

98
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:27,611
-Sir.
-Coming.

99
00:04:28,812 --> 00:04:30,113
Thank you.

100
00:04:30,714 --> 00:04:32,716
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

101
00:04:32,782 --> 00:04:34,517
Do you know the comic <i>Sikgaek</i>?

102
00:04:34,584 --> 00:04:36,786
-By Huh Youngman?
-Yes.

103
00:04:36,853 --> 00:04:40,156
-He drew the owner exactly as he is.
-Is that so?

104
00:04:40,223 --> 00:04:41,791
This is him.

105
00:04:41,858 --> 00:04:43,126
Oh, that's him.

106
00:04:43,193 --> 00:04:45,929
It really looks like him.

107
00:04:45,996 --> 00:04:47,063
I agree.

108
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,700
When were you featured in this comic?

109
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:51,835
In 2012.

110
00:04:51,902 --> 00:04:53,904
-Really?
-Is that true?

111
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,138
It's spot-on.

112
00:04:55,205 --> 00:04:56,339
CAPTURED HIM PERFECTLY

113
00:04:56,406 --> 00:04:58,808
-They're exactly the same.
-Definitely.

114
00:05:00,644 --> 00:05:02,379
Let's order some food.

115
00:05:02,445 --> 00:05:05,048
-We'll have four servings of the <i>samhap</i>.
-Okay.

116
00:05:05,115 --> 00:05:08,118
No, we'll have three servings.
And a large steamed skate.

117
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:11,121
Can we have a clear one?
Let's start with that.

118
00:05:11,187 --> 00:05:13,256
-"A clear one"?
-A clear <i>takju</i>.

119
00:05:13,323 --> 00:05:14,891
<i>-Takju?</i>
-The top layer.

120
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:19,596
Oh, and for the <i>samhap</i>, can we get
the more fermented one I asked for?

121
00:05:19,663 --> 00:05:20,664
Wait a minute.

122
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,601
-All right.
-Thank you.

123
00:05:24,668 --> 00:05:26,236
DUJUN HAS A TOUGH ROAD AHEAD

124
00:05:26,303 --> 00:05:27,504
A more fermented skate?

125
00:05:27,571 --> 00:05:29,439
-Yes.
-Sounds great.

126
00:05:29,506 --> 00:05:33,910
If you call a week in advance
before coming here,

127
00:05:33,977 --> 00:05:35,445
he ferments it a bit more.

128
00:05:35,512 --> 00:05:37,647
-Wow, that's nice.
-Then the bones are tender.

129
00:05:37,714 --> 00:05:39,616
And the scent is better and stronger.

130
00:05:42,219 --> 00:05:43,887
THE SIDE DISHES ARE HERE

131
00:05:43,954 --> 00:05:45,055
Look at the veggies.

132
00:05:46,122 --> 00:05:48,058
The kimchi looks amazing.

133
00:05:48,124 --> 00:05:50,260
-It's insane.
-Wow, look at that.

134
00:05:50,327 --> 00:05:52,796
<i>The kimchi in places like this is…</i>

135
00:05:52,862 --> 00:05:54,331
<i>-It's the main dish.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>

136
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:56,833
AGED KIMCHI PAIRS WELL
WITH FERMENTED SKATE

137
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,436
-We farm the napa cabbage.
-Wow, that's impressive.

138
00:05:59,502 --> 00:06:01,471
-All of them?
-Yes, 1,500 heads.

139
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:03,607
That's a lot of work.

140
00:06:03,673 --> 00:06:07,677
In the past, when I came with my mom,
he packed us some kimchi to take home.

141
00:06:07,744 --> 00:06:10,981
-Shall I pack some for you today?
-I would love some. Thank you.

142
00:06:12,115 --> 00:06:14,818
HE FARMS NAPA CABBAGES ON HIGHLAND

143
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:18,722
MAKES FRESH KIMCHI IN LARGE BATCHES

144
00:06:19,489 --> 00:06:22,325
THEIR AGED KIMCHI IS FERMENTED
AT THE IDEAL TEMPERATURE

145
00:06:23,193 --> 00:06:25,829
-It's here.
-Is that <i>takju</i>?

146
00:06:25,896 --> 00:06:27,864
-The kettle…
-It's so pretty.

147
00:06:27,931 --> 00:06:29,900
I've never seen it in a yellow kettle.

148
00:06:29,966 --> 00:06:31,735
-It's nice.
-It brings back memories.

149
00:06:32,335 --> 00:06:36,506
Skate liver was delivered today,
so I prepared it fresh.

150
00:06:36,573 --> 00:06:37,908
Dang, look at that.

151
00:06:37,974 --> 00:06:39,376
MOUTHWATERING

152
00:06:40,277 --> 00:06:43,046
FRESH SKATE LIVER HAS A LIGHT PINK COLOR

153
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,082
<i>This is fresh, so it doesn't smell at all.</i>

154
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:47,784
FRESHLY CAUGHT AND DELIVERED

155
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:50,287
-It's liver?
-Yes, it's liver.

156
00:06:50,353 --> 00:06:52,155
-From the skate.
-Yes.

157
00:06:52,222 --> 00:06:54,925
This isn't available every day.

158
00:06:54,991 --> 00:06:58,528
-You can only have it when it's delivered.
-That's right.

159
00:06:58,595 --> 00:06:59,963
Can we order more of this?

160
00:07:00,564 --> 00:07:02,632
-Stop it.
-That's enough.

161
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:03,733
FLUSTERED

162
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,402
Don't ask tough questions.

163
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:08,171
-It's the most valuable.
-There's only a tiny bit.

164
00:07:08,238 --> 00:07:09,873
I'd serve more if we were close.

165
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,908
Really? Sir, let's be friends.

166
00:07:14,144 --> 00:07:17,214
The <i>makgeolli </i>here is amazing.

167
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,752
You have to try the clear layer
on top of the <i>makgeolli </i>first.

168
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:26,656
ONLY REGULARS KNOW
HOW TO DRINK THEIR <i>MAKGEOLLI</i>

169
00:07:26,723 --> 00:07:28,191
<i>-Try it this way.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

170
00:07:28,258 --> 00:07:29,492
Let's have a drink.

171
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:32,329
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

172
00:07:34,231 --> 00:07:37,767
TAKING A NICE SIP

173
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:38,935
It's very tangy.

174
00:07:42,372 --> 00:07:43,873
It has high acidity.

175
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:46,176
Dang, this is good.

176
00:07:46,243 --> 00:07:48,144
-Isn't it yummy?
-Yes, it's so sweet.

177
00:07:48,211 --> 00:07:51,314
I like extra-fermented <i>makgeolli</i>.

178
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:52,883
It's like a soda.

179
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:54,851
-Isn't it tasty?
-It's excellent.

180
00:07:55,752 --> 00:08:00,423
ITS TANGINESS IS THE HIGHLIGHT

181
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,992
Can we try this?

182
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:04,594
-Skate liver?
-Try the liver.

183
00:08:04,661 --> 00:08:07,631
-It's great with a bit of salt.
-How do we eat this?

184
00:08:07,697 --> 00:08:08,999
<i>Try it with coarse salt.</i>

185
00:08:09,065 --> 00:08:11,768
<i>-It's mixed with chili powder.</i>
<i>-And sesame seeds.</i>

186
00:08:11,835 --> 00:08:13,703
<i>The liver is super tender</i>

187
00:08:14,137 --> 00:08:17,507
and the coarse salt adds
nice crunchiness to the texture.

188
00:08:17,941 --> 00:08:20,477
-Take a piece.
-Wow, it's mouthwatering.

189
00:08:20,544 --> 00:08:22,212
-Salt--
-That's a big piece.

190
00:08:22,812 --> 00:08:24,548
-Wait…
-Dujun, try this one.

191
00:08:24,614 --> 00:08:25,882
-This?
-It doesn't smell.

192
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:28,118
Eat it right away.

193
00:08:28,184 --> 00:08:31,121
TRY IT WITH SALT

194
00:08:32,188 --> 00:08:35,325
YUM

195
00:08:38,795 --> 00:08:40,230
WOW

196
00:08:40,297 --> 00:08:41,665
Isn't it super nutty?

197
00:08:41,731 --> 00:08:43,199
It's better than foie gras.

198
00:08:43,266 --> 00:08:45,902
-Isn't it delicious?
-It's like butter.

199
00:08:45,969 --> 00:08:48,538
It's like eating
cream cheese with a spoon.

200
00:08:48,605 --> 00:08:50,307
TASTES LIKE RICH CREAM CHEESE

201
00:08:50,373 --> 00:08:52,776
-How is it so good?
-This is fine, right?

202
00:08:52,842 --> 00:08:54,477
-It's like cream.
-Exactly.

203
00:08:57,881 --> 00:09:00,617
PURE HAPPINESS

204
00:09:00,684 --> 00:09:03,486
The taste lingers in my mouth.

205
00:09:03,553 --> 00:09:05,789
<i>-It just melted in my mouth.</i>
<i>-It's amazing.</i>

206
00:09:05,855 --> 00:09:06,957
<i>It's like foie gras.</i>

207
00:09:07,023 --> 00:09:09,426
<i>-The texture is insane.</i>
<i>-We ate all of it.</i>

208
00:09:09,492 --> 00:09:12,062
THE RICH FLAVOR JUST MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH

209
00:09:12,596 --> 00:09:15,065
I bet you can't even make cream like this.

210
00:09:15,131 --> 00:09:16,499
THE MAIN DISH IS FINALLY HERE

211
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:17,968
It's here.

212
00:09:18,034 --> 00:09:20,437
Look at the color. It's pink.

213
00:09:21,404 --> 00:09:25,208
SKATE <i>SAMHAP</i>

214
00:09:26,142 --> 00:09:29,379
A COMBINATION OF STEAMED PORK
AND FERMENTED SKATE

215
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,248
SKATE IS FERMENTED NICE AND PINK

216
00:09:31,314 --> 00:09:34,150
FERMENTED FOR AN EXTRA 1-2 WEEKS,
NORMAL FERMENTED SKATE

217
00:09:34,217 --> 00:09:36,419
This is the more fermented version.

218
00:09:36,486 --> 00:09:38,889
-Thank you.
-The fragrance is amazing.

219
00:09:38,955 --> 00:09:42,259
It transitions from pink

220
00:09:42,993 --> 00:09:44,728
to a slightly reddish-gray.

221
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:47,998
Sir, do you ferment the skate yourself?

222
00:09:48,064 --> 00:09:49,633
-Yes.
-I see.

223
00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:53,837
Summer is closed fishing season,
so we have to ferment them for long time.

224
00:09:53,904 --> 00:09:56,640
<i>We ferment them in the countryside.</i>

225
00:09:57,507 --> 00:10:00,911
<i>In the fall and winter,</i>
<i>we ferment them in the restaurant.</i>

226
00:10:02,546 --> 00:10:05,315
-It looks scrumptious.
-Let's try it. I can't wait.

227
00:10:05,382 --> 00:10:07,584
I'll tell you my favorite way to eat this.

228
00:10:07,651 --> 00:10:12,422
For the normal version,
I like to eat it with a bit of salt.

229
00:10:13,323 --> 00:10:15,825
Just take a piece.

230
00:10:15,892 --> 00:10:18,094
-And dip in salt.
-Just a tiny bit.

231
00:10:19,462 --> 00:10:24,000
ENJOYING THE TASTE
OF FERMENTED SKATE AS IT IS

232
00:10:24,901 --> 00:10:28,271
This fermented skate
is already a bit salty,

233
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:31,007
so just add a touch of salt.

234
00:10:34,911 --> 00:10:39,683
MINSEONG AND TAEHOON ARE ENJOYING IT

235
00:10:40,383 --> 00:10:44,221
CHEF CHO SEOHYEONG IS LOVING IT AS WELL

236
00:10:44,287 --> 00:10:47,057
IT'S DELICIOUS

237
00:10:47,123 --> 00:10:50,160
BUT DUJUN IS AFRAID TO TAKE A BITE

238
00:10:50,227 --> 00:10:53,263
COME ON, TRY IT

239
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,633
HESITANT

240
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,635
-Just a bit of salt.
-That's it.

241
00:10:58,702 --> 00:11:00,203
Dang, this is…

242
00:11:01,137 --> 00:11:05,275
WILL HE LIKE IT?

243
00:11:05,508 --> 00:11:07,344
Chew it for a long time.

244
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,446
And breathe in through your nose.

245
00:11:12,482 --> 00:11:15,352
Whenever I eat <i>samhap</i>…

246
00:11:15,418 --> 00:11:16,820
I can't think clearly.

247
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,290
-Are you crying?
-I can't think straight.

248
00:11:20,357 --> 00:11:22,559
-Are you okay?
-His eyes are red.

249
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,661
They sure are.

250
00:11:24,728 --> 00:11:27,130
-Your eyes are red.
-I'm okay.

251
00:11:27,597 --> 00:11:29,566
How was it? I can't remember.

252
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:30,934
-I…
-It's…

253
00:11:31,001 --> 00:11:32,202
But you just ate it.

254
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:37,741
Personally, when I tried
the normally fermented skate,

255
00:11:37,807 --> 00:11:41,411
I thought the texture
of the bones would be tougher.

256
00:11:41,478 --> 00:11:44,047
<i>But since it's high-quality,</i>
<i>the bones were super tender.</i>

257
00:11:44,114 --> 00:11:46,016
<i>It's extremely nutty in flavor.</i>

258
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:50,120
Domestic and imported ones differ
in how tender the bones are.

259
00:11:50,186 --> 00:11:53,790
Right, domestic and imported ones
are different varieties.

260
00:11:53,857 --> 00:11:56,192
-Oh, are they different?
-Yes.

261
00:11:56,259 --> 00:11:58,228
The domestic one is called <i>chamhongeo</i>.

262
00:11:58,295 --> 00:12:02,599
The cartilage is thinner and longer.

263
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:08,238
The ones that are caught near Argentina
and Chile are called <i>meokhongeo</i>.

264
00:12:08,305 --> 00:12:11,908
It has a darker shade and has thick bones.

265
00:12:11,975 --> 00:12:14,177
-The bones are tough?
-Yes, exactly.

266
00:12:14,778 --> 00:12:16,146
MEOKHONGEO, CHAMHONGEO

267
00:12:16,213 --> 00:12:18,615
THE IMPORTED ONE IS LONGER AND THINNER

268
00:12:18,682 --> 00:12:23,119
THE DOMESTIC ONE IS PINK WITH THICK FLESH

269
00:12:23,186 --> 00:12:26,656
The first owner opened this place in 1966.

270
00:12:26,723 --> 00:12:29,392
-It's a long-standing spot.
-Dang, I can't believe it.

271
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:30,994
-Isn't it insane?
-Yes.

272
00:12:31,061 --> 00:12:36,333
It's been 37 years since he took over
the business from his mother.

273
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:39,236
-That's as long as Dujun's been alive.
-I'm 37.

274
00:12:39,302 --> 00:12:41,771
For all that time,
they've only focused on skate.

275
00:12:41,838 --> 00:12:44,107
-That's awesome.
-Absolutely.

276
00:12:44,841 --> 00:12:46,443
-Shall we try the <i>samhap</i>?
-Sure.

277
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:48,979
-Try it…
-When you try this--

278
00:12:49,045 --> 00:12:52,816
-With steamed pork.
-Eat it with pork and kimchi.

279
00:12:52,883 --> 00:12:57,254
First, take a piece of pork,
and then add salted shrimp on top of that.

280
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,556
-On top of the meat?
-Yes, just a bit.

281
00:12:59,623 --> 00:13:01,825
After adding the salted shrimp,

282
00:13:01,892 --> 00:13:05,061
slightly dip the fermented skate
in <i>chojang</i>.

283
00:13:05,662 --> 00:13:08,531
PLACE THE FERMENTED SKATE
ON TOP OF THE PORK

284
00:13:08,598 --> 00:13:09,599
Dip it lightly.

285
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,869
-You told me that this was tangy.
-Yes, I did.

286
00:13:12,936 --> 00:13:15,405
Drizzle a spoonful
of the top clear layer on this.

287
00:13:15,472 --> 00:13:16,840
This <i>makgeolli</i>?

288
00:13:16,907 --> 00:13:18,375
-Yes.
-Really?

289
00:13:20,477 --> 00:13:21,845
ADD <i>MAKGEOLLI </i>TO IT

290
00:13:21,912 --> 00:13:24,948
<i>When you drizzle this on top,</i>

291
00:13:25,815 --> 00:13:30,787
it adds a sweetness and tanginess
to the flavor of the fermented skate.

292
00:13:30,854 --> 00:13:33,890
-We usually dip it in <i>makgeolli </i>vinegar.
-Really?

293
00:13:33,957 --> 00:13:35,759
-Really?
-Yes, like steamed skate.

294
00:13:35,825 --> 00:13:36,893
I never knew that.

295
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,129
The flesh gets cooked by the alcohol.

296
00:13:39,195 --> 00:13:41,598
Like when you pickle ingredients
in vinegar.

297
00:13:41,665 --> 00:13:44,301
And then, put the aged kimchi on top.

298
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:46,303
-With kimchi?
-Yes.

299
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:51,641
AN EXCELLENT COMBINATION
OF VARIOUS INGREDIENTS

300
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,610
I'll place it on top and try it.

301
00:13:53,677 --> 00:13:56,880
WHAT WILL THE SKATE <i>SAMHAP </i>TASTE LIKE?

302
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,750
ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS

303
00:14:01,685 --> 00:14:04,955
NEWBIE DUJUN IS ALSO ENJOYING IT

304
00:14:05,021 --> 00:14:08,024
OR MAYBE NOT?

305
00:14:11,795 --> 00:14:14,064
YUM

306
00:14:17,334 --> 00:14:18,335
It's sour.

307
00:14:18,768 --> 00:14:20,704
-Yes, it's sour and tangy.
-I agree.

308
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,539
Wow, I can taste…

309
00:14:23,773 --> 00:14:26,176
-the richness of the <i>makgeolli</i>.
-Me too.

310
00:14:26,977 --> 00:14:28,478
By adding a bit of acidity,

311
00:14:29,212 --> 00:14:32,649
I think it's much more flavorful.

312
00:14:32,716 --> 00:14:37,354
When umami meets acidity,
the umami becomes incredibly intense.

313
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,222
Gosh, I'm obsessed with this.

314
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:42,292
I think <i>samhap </i>wraps up
all the flavors nicely.

315
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:46,363
The kimchi and the pork
help balance the pungency.

316
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:47,864
They really do.

317
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:53,403
Those who aren't fond of fermented skate
should try it with kimchi and pork.

318
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,673
If you're trying <i>samhap</i>,
the skate can be extra-fermented.

319
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,642
-It won't be too strong.
-I agree.

320
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:02,279
The <i>samhap </i>envelops the flavor
to make it just right.

321
00:15:02,345 --> 00:15:03,647
<i>I like it.</i>

322
00:15:03,713 --> 00:15:06,316
<i>SAMHAP </i>BALANCES THE PUNGENCY
OF FERMENTED SKATE

323
00:15:07,484 --> 00:15:11,955
ANYONE CAN ENJOY
THE TASTE OF FERMENTED SKATE

324
00:15:12,022 --> 00:15:14,391
Everyone here likes fermented skate.

325
00:15:14,457 --> 00:15:16,393
When did you first try it?

326
00:15:17,027 --> 00:15:18,128
When I was 5 years old.

327
00:15:18,194 --> 00:15:19,529
-Really?
-That's early.

328
00:15:19,596 --> 00:15:23,400
When I was five years old,
my mom took me to a funeral.

329
00:15:23,466 --> 00:15:27,737
She was so busy that she forgot about me
and just let me roam around.

330
00:15:27,804 --> 00:15:31,675
She told me I was eating fermented skate
in the kitchen because I was hungry.

331
00:15:31,741 --> 00:15:33,476
-Is that true?
-Yes, it is.

332
00:15:33,543 --> 00:15:36,246
The old ladies there said I was unusual.

333
00:15:36,313 --> 00:15:39,416
"A five-year-old is eating
fermented skate."

334
00:15:39,482 --> 00:15:42,452
Also, my dad's friends came over
when I was seven or eight.

335
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:44,054
They brought fermented skate,

336
00:15:44,321 --> 00:15:45,989
and I loved it at that time.

337
00:15:46,056 --> 00:15:47,991
He can't believe it at all.

338
00:15:48,058 --> 00:15:49,526
-When you were a child?
-Yes.

339
00:15:49,593 --> 00:15:51,361
-I still enjoy it.
-That's impressive.

340
00:15:51,428 --> 00:15:53,496
LOVED IT SINCE SHE WAS LITTLE

341
00:15:53,763 --> 00:15:55,899
<i>There are lots of fermented skate places.</i>

342
00:15:55,966 --> 00:15:58,735
<i>But why did you recommend this restaurant?</i>

343
00:15:59,603 --> 00:16:01,638
I'm a Korean cuisine chef,

344
00:16:01,705 --> 00:16:05,141
so people think that I'm a good cook
because my mom must be.

345
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:09,446
They always think that I inherited
my mom's cooking skills.

346
00:16:09,512 --> 00:16:11,581
But my mom is a terrible cook.

347
00:16:11,648 --> 00:16:13,083
-Stop it.
-She will be upset.

348
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:14,517
Let me call your mom.

349
00:16:15,518 --> 00:16:20,156
Since I wanted to become a chef,
my mom decided to feed me good food.

350
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,026
The cooking school I went to
when I was little

351
00:16:23,093 --> 00:16:25,228
was right here in Jongno.

352
00:16:25,295 --> 00:16:29,299
So, I've visited all the old-school
eateries in this neighborhood.

353
00:16:29,366 --> 00:16:31,668
Wow, your mother let you experience that.

354
00:16:31,735 --> 00:16:35,205
I came here very often
with my mom in high school.

355
00:16:35,272 --> 00:16:38,475
I think I came here at least once a month.

356
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,143
She trained me to eat this.

357
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,078
So, I've reached the highest level.

358
00:16:43,013 --> 00:16:45,115
I became the master of fermented skate.

359
00:16:45,181 --> 00:16:47,751
SEOHYEONG BECAME A FERMENTED SKATE EXPERT

360
00:16:47,817 --> 00:16:51,588
So, we've tried the <i>samhap</i>
and the skate liver so far.

361
00:16:52,222 --> 00:16:54,224
But I'm curious about the steamed skate.

362
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,960
-I wonder how tasty it will be.
-It's unbelievable.

363
00:16:57,027 --> 00:16:58,194
Really?

364
00:16:58,261 --> 00:17:01,298
-What does it taste like?
-It's stronger.

365
00:17:01,364 --> 00:17:03,099
Are you serious? How come?

366
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,135
Isn't it seasoned with other ingredients?

367
00:17:05,201 --> 00:17:08,171
You must be thinking
it's like spicy braised monkfish.

368
00:17:08,238 --> 00:17:09,806
-Is it not like that?
-No.

369
00:17:09,873 --> 00:17:11,675
-It's not braised?
-It's not seasoned.

370
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:13,543
-It's here.
-Really?

371
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,445
-It's here.
-Really?

372
00:17:15,512 --> 00:17:16,780
STEAMED SKATE IS HERE

373
00:17:16,846 --> 00:17:17,847
DISPIRITED, EXCITED

374
00:17:17,914 --> 00:17:20,016
It's literally just steamed.

375
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,384
Dang, I can't wait.

376
00:17:22,085 --> 00:17:26,356
STEAMED SKATE

377
00:17:26,423 --> 00:17:29,726
<i>It's rare to see this dish</i>
<i>without seasoning.</i>

378
00:17:29,793 --> 00:17:33,897
It's usually made with chili powder
and other seasoning on top.

379
00:17:33,964 --> 00:17:34,965
But they just…

380
00:17:35,632 --> 00:17:38,301
-Try it as it is?
-Enjoy the original taste.

381
00:17:39,135 --> 00:17:42,939
HE STEAMS THE SKATE FOR TEN MINUTES
UNTIL IT BECOMES TENDER,

382
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:48,812
WHICH INTENSIFIES
THE RICHNESS OF THE SKATE

383
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:55,619
AND THE BONES BECOME TENDER

384
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:58,555
It doesn't smell strong at first.

385
00:17:59,589 --> 00:18:01,925
-You're right.
-But if you cut it in half…

386
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,995
-It smells once you cut it.
-It's locked inside.

387
00:18:05,061 --> 00:18:06,496
-It bursts.
-It bursts.

388
00:18:06,563 --> 00:18:08,365
It's like opening Pandora's box.

389
00:18:08,431 --> 00:18:11,134
BURSTING WITH ANXIETY

390
00:18:11,201 --> 00:18:15,672
-You can see the skate's original form.
-Right.

391
00:18:15,739 --> 00:18:18,441
But it falls apart
if you don't steam it correctly.

392
00:18:18,508 --> 00:18:21,278
-Oh, because it's super tender?
-Exactly.

393
00:18:21,912 --> 00:18:26,516
Once you try it,
you'll see why it's so delicious.

394
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,585
-He's hilarious.
-Chef.

395
00:18:28,652 --> 00:18:29,920
-Cut it in half.
-Sure.

396
00:18:29,986 --> 00:18:32,088
Cut it like this.

397
00:18:32,155 --> 00:18:34,758
-Do you see the steam?
-Yes.

398
00:18:34,824 --> 00:18:36,159
Why don't you smell it?

399
00:18:36,226 --> 00:18:37,827
TAKES A WHIFF

400
00:18:37,894 --> 00:18:40,830
COMPLETELY FREAKED OUT

401
00:18:41,631 --> 00:18:44,401
-Wow, it's way stronger.
-Yes, it is.

402
00:18:45,735 --> 00:18:47,837
TAEHOON, FAMILIAR WITH SKATE,
TAKES A WHIFF

403
00:18:47,904 --> 00:18:50,740
-Oh, this is the stuff.
-I'm wide awake.

404
00:18:52,275 --> 00:18:53,977
It looks like you're crying.

405
00:18:54,544 --> 00:18:57,714
AT A LOSS FOR WORDS

406
00:18:57,781 --> 00:19:00,884
-You can eat the bones as well.
-That's right.

407
00:19:00,951 --> 00:19:05,155
TAKING A BITE OF STEAMED SKATE

408
00:19:05,222 --> 00:19:08,158
NUMBS HIS MOUTH

409
00:19:08,225 --> 00:19:09,659
COUGH

410
00:19:09,726 --> 00:19:12,896
-Dang, this is the real deal.
-This hits the spot.

411
00:19:17,234 --> 00:19:18,768
Gosh, I can't dare to try it.

412
00:19:20,003 --> 00:19:23,273
MEANWHILE, THE SKATE MASTER IS ENJOYING IT

413
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,942
EVEN THE EXPERT COUGHS

414
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:31,114
MINSEONG TAKES A BITE

415
00:19:32,716 --> 00:19:34,784
SCRUMPTIOUS

416
00:19:34,851 --> 00:19:35,852
I love it.

417
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,855
NEWBIE DUJUN GATHERS HIS COURAGE
AND TRIES IT

418
00:19:38,922 --> 00:19:41,725
TAKES A TINY BITE

419
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:45,095
TAKES A BIGGER BITE

420
00:19:45,161 --> 00:19:47,030
WOW

421
00:19:47,097 --> 00:19:51,067
EXPLODES WITH FLAVOR

422
00:19:52,569 --> 00:19:54,504
It's even a bit spicy.

423
00:19:54,571 --> 00:19:56,673
-That's exactly how it should taste.
-Really?

424
00:19:56,907 --> 00:19:58,108
It feels spicy.

425
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,610
Is this okay to eat?

426
00:20:00,677 --> 00:20:03,313
Doesn't it taste like high-quality mint?

427
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,115
TASTES LIKE THE FINEST MINT

428
00:20:05,181 --> 00:20:06,283
I can't believe this.

429
00:20:06,349 --> 00:20:08,451
THE NEWBIE IS TAKEN ABACK

430
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:13,356
When I chewed the raw version,
the flavor built up with every bite.

431
00:20:14,157 --> 00:20:16,860
<i>-But this is strong from the start.</i>
<i>-Absolutely.</i>

432
00:20:17,827 --> 00:20:19,129
It's super pungent.

433
00:20:19,195 --> 00:20:21,364
-It's because you had a tiny piece.
-Really?

434
00:20:21,431 --> 00:20:23,900
If you try the bigger piece,

435
00:20:24,568 --> 00:20:26,169
your throat will burn.

436
00:20:26,236 --> 00:20:29,139
-Wow, it's very strong.
-It burns the roof of your mouth.

437
00:20:29,205 --> 00:20:31,041
-Is that true?
-Yes, it happens.

438
00:20:31,107 --> 00:20:34,945
<i>It's alkaline-rich,</i>
<i>so it burns the roof of your mouth.</i>

439
00:20:36,112 --> 00:20:38,148
Take a leaf of the kimchi.

440
00:20:38,215 --> 00:20:40,050
Wrap this up in it.

441
00:20:40,584 --> 00:20:42,052
And eat it in one bite.

442
00:20:42,686 --> 00:20:45,689
The kimchi balances it out,
so it's even better.

443
00:20:46,556 --> 00:20:47,691
This is so much fun.

444
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,292
It's cool.

445
00:20:50,193 --> 00:20:52,963
YUM

446
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:55,832
Look at the bone. It's thick.

447
00:20:55,899 --> 00:20:57,434
-It sure is.
-Nevertheless…

448
00:20:59,202 --> 00:21:01,905
-Oh, it snaps.
-You can chew it with your teeth.

449
00:21:01,972 --> 00:21:03,406
-It's edible.
-Is it cartilage?

450
00:21:03,473 --> 00:21:05,976
Yes, the bones of a skate
are all cartilage.

451
00:21:06,042 --> 00:21:07,143
I see.

452
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,879
They steamed it perfectly.

453
00:21:08,945 --> 00:21:12,349
If you try the same dish
at some other restaurants,

454
00:21:12,415 --> 00:21:15,252
you put it in your mouth
and take the bones out.

455
00:21:15,318 --> 00:21:18,121
-Because it's too tough.
-You just eat the flesh.

456
00:21:18,188 --> 00:21:20,924
<i>But the bones here are as tender as flesh.</i>

457
00:21:21,658 --> 00:21:23,660
<i>It falls apart with a soft bite.</i>

458
00:21:25,028 --> 00:21:28,965
IT HAS A UNIQUE AROMA AND SOFT TEXTURE

459
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,937
ANOTHER ONE OF THEIR SIGNATURE DISHES

460
00:21:34,004 --> 00:21:36,573
If you want the full flavor,

461
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,775
have it with rice.

462
00:21:38,842 --> 00:21:41,945
And add a bit of salted shrimp
on the rice.

463
00:21:42,012 --> 00:21:44,748
If you chew it for a long time,
the sweetness comes through

464
00:21:44,814 --> 00:21:46,683
-with the mix of starch and shrimp.
-Oh.

465
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,185
At that moment,
put the skate in your mouth.

466
00:21:49,252 --> 00:21:53,690
The sweetness, umami, and everything
just explode in your mouth.

467
00:21:54,224 --> 00:21:55,859
Does it hit your taste buds?

468
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,930
First, scoop a spoonful of rice.

469
00:22:00,897 --> 00:22:01,898
Like this?

470
00:22:01,965 --> 00:22:05,035
-There's nothing that can top this.
-I'll try it.

471
00:22:05,101 --> 00:22:06,736
-Do we eat it like this?
-Yes.

472
00:22:06,803 --> 00:22:09,940
TAKING A BITE

473
00:22:10,907 --> 00:22:11,908
At this moment,

474
00:22:12,776 --> 00:22:14,578
try the skate when it's sweet.

475
00:22:14,644 --> 00:22:18,215
EAT A PIECE OF STEAMED SKATE RIGHT AWAY

476
00:22:18,281 --> 00:22:21,017
OUT OF THIS WORLD

477
00:22:21,718 --> 00:22:25,488
MINSEONG AND TAEHOON TRY IT AS WELL

478
00:22:27,691 --> 00:22:32,762
SIMPLY IRRESISTIBLE

479
00:22:35,031 --> 00:22:37,767
EVERYONE IS SATISFIED BESIDES DUJUN

480
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:40,604
-Doesn't it go well with rice?
-It sure does.

481
00:22:41,738 --> 00:22:42,806
JUST CHEWING THE RICE

482
00:22:42,872 --> 00:22:45,642
-Doesn't it go well with rice?
-It sure does.

483
00:22:46,209 --> 00:22:47,210
I'm afraid to try.

484
00:22:49,012 --> 00:22:50,480
He's absolutely terrified.

485
00:22:51,214 --> 00:22:53,516
-I can't eat it.
-Dujun, don't cry.

486
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:54,618
TEARY

487
00:22:54,684 --> 00:22:56,119
I'm getting teary-eyed.

488
00:22:57,354 --> 00:22:58,588
Isn't it great?

489
00:22:58,655 --> 00:23:03,560
The sweet flavor at the end maximizes
the flavor of the fermented skate.

490
00:23:03,627 --> 00:23:05,462
<i>Your eyes tear up when you take a bite.</i>

491
00:23:05,528 --> 00:23:08,265
<i>-Right, isn't it amazing?</i>
<i>-Wow, it's fantastic.</i>

492
00:23:10,634 --> 00:23:13,003
Come to think of it,
we didn't eat the nose.

493
00:23:13,069 --> 00:23:15,005
Wait, do you eat that?

494
00:23:15,071 --> 00:23:17,307
If you didn't try the nose,

495
00:23:17,374 --> 00:23:20,110
you can't say
you have truly eaten fermented skate.

496
00:23:20,176 --> 00:23:22,245
That's a bit too much for me.

497
00:23:22,312 --> 00:23:24,948
Where is the nose in a skate?

498
00:23:25,015 --> 00:23:26,583
<i>-The front tip.</i>
<i>-The pointy part.</i>

499
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,919
THE TIP OF THE HEAD

500
00:23:30,954 --> 00:23:32,989
-Could it be?
-What is it?

501
00:23:33,056 --> 00:23:34,491
-It's skate cheek.
-Right.

502
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:35,559
It looks scary.

503
00:23:36,459 --> 00:23:40,697
SKATE CHEEK AND NOSE

504
00:23:41,298 --> 00:23:43,199
THE SKATE NOSE HAS A SLIPPERY PART

505
00:23:43,266 --> 00:23:47,003
AND A BUMPY PART

506
00:23:47,704 --> 00:23:50,607
THE SKATE CHEEK LOOKS SPRINGY

507
00:23:50,674 --> 00:23:55,512
The fermented skate is on level 1.5,
and the steamed skate is on level 2.

508
00:23:55,579 --> 00:23:57,948
-And this is level 6.
-My goodness.

509
00:23:59,216 --> 00:24:01,084
It just jumped up that high.

510
00:24:01,151 --> 00:24:03,286
-I don't think I can eat it.
-Don't eat it.

511
00:24:03,353 --> 00:24:05,188
<i>I don't think you can handle this.</i>

512
00:24:05,255 --> 00:24:08,925
LEVEL 6: STARTING WITH THE SLIPPERY NOSE

513
00:24:10,927 --> 00:24:12,729
MY GOSH

514
00:24:12,796 --> 00:24:13,797
This is it.

515
00:24:13,863 --> 00:24:14,965
EVEN TAEHOON LOST IT

516
00:24:15,031 --> 00:24:16,032
This is the stuff.

517
00:24:17,934 --> 00:24:20,003
-This is the nose.
-I should just watch.

518
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,338
Add a bit of salt.

519
00:24:21,404 --> 00:24:24,608
WATCHING THEIR <i>MUKBANG </i>IN THE FRONT ROW

520
00:24:26,443 --> 00:24:30,714
TAEHOON TRIES THE SMOOTH NOSE

521
00:24:34,084 --> 00:24:35,085
TEARY

522
00:24:35,151 --> 00:24:36,519
Taehoon, you're crying.

523
00:24:36,586 --> 00:24:37,854
You're tearing up.

524
00:24:38,555 --> 00:24:42,225
-It's like very strong peppermint candy.
-Sure.

525
00:24:42,292 --> 00:24:43,994
-You know the spicy kind?
-Right.

526
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:47,898
I can taste the strong flavors
of cinnamon and peppermint.

527
00:24:49,766 --> 00:24:52,168
-Don't recommend it to me.
-It's the truth.

528
00:24:52,235 --> 00:24:54,437
You become wide awake.

529
00:24:54,504 --> 00:24:56,006
I'm already wide awake.

530
00:24:56,806 --> 00:25:01,511
COMING UP NEXT, THE BUMPY NOSE

531
00:25:02,946 --> 00:25:06,383
MINSEONG IS ENJOYING IT

532
00:25:09,686 --> 00:25:11,288
-It's yummy.
-It's also spicy.

533
00:25:14,991 --> 00:25:16,293
It's excellent.

534
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:18,128
COUGHS

535
00:25:18,194 --> 00:25:19,796
Your tongue gets…

536
00:25:19,863 --> 00:25:22,165
-Try it.
-Absolutely not.

537
00:25:22,766 --> 00:25:24,968
From the root of your tongue…

538
00:25:25,035 --> 00:25:27,070
FROM THE ROOF TO THE SURFACE

539
00:25:27,137 --> 00:25:29,372
You know when you get numbed
at the dentist?

540
00:25:29,439 --> 00:25:30,874
Does it feel like that?

541
00:25:30,941 --> 00:25:32,642
My mouth feels numb.

542
00:25:32,709 --> 00:25:34,811
-Is it even edible?
-Yes, it's tasty.

543
00:25:38,248 --> 00:25:39,249
YUM

544
00:25:39,316 --> 00:25:44,221
You can't really compare the texture
of the nose with anything.

545
00:25:44,287 --> 00:25:46,156
<i>It tastes like soft gummies.</i>

546
00:25:46,223 --> 00:25:48,959
<i>Yes, it's like that.</i>

547
00:25:49,025 --> 00:25:52,963
And it also has
that chewy texture of konjac.

548
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:56,199
It's like a spoon worm
or a cooked sea cucumber.

549
00:25:56,266 --> 00:25:58,835
If you keep on chewing it,

550
00:25:59,402 --> 00:26:00,904
and then take a sip of <i>takju,</i>

551
00:26:00,971 --> 00:26:02,639
you'll feel a tingling sensation.

552
00:26:02,706 --> 00:26:04,241
It hits you right in the head.

553
00:26:05,141 --> 00:26:07,878
-Do you enjoy the pain?
-It's unbelievably good.

554
00:26:08,778 --> 00:26:10,981
Is this skate cheek?

555
00:26:11,047 --> 00:26:14,417
Yes, but rather than eating this raw,

556
00:26:14,484 --> 00:26:17,020
I like to put it in <i>ramyeon </i>or stew
like shabu-shabu.

557
00:26:17,087 --> 00:26:20,590
<i>-Ramyeon?</i>
-Then let's leave this here.

558
00:26:20,657 --> 00:26:22,859
-Let's dip it in when we get <i>ramyeon</i>.
-Sure.

559
00:26:22,926 --> 00:26:25,362
-Do you also add the nose?
-Yes, I add it all.

560
00:26:25,428 --> 00:26:26,630
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

561
00:26:26,696 --> 00:26:28,465
Can we eat separately?

562
00:26:28,531 --> 00:26:32,535
-The smell gets stronger if you boil it.
-Of course.

563
00:26:32,602 --> 00:26:33,770
-Really?
-Yes.

564
00:26:33,837 --> 00:26:39,009
If this is on level 6,
the dishes with broth are on level 9.

565
00:26:39,075 --> 00:26:41,344
Really? But it's <i>ramyeon</i>.

566
00:26:42,345 --> 00:26:44,915
-But <i>ramyeon </i>isn't on the menu.
-Right.

567
00:26:44,981 --> 00:26:45,982
NO <i>RAMYEON</i>

568
00:26:46,049 --> 00:26:48,018
<i>I thought it was on the menu.</i>

569
00:26:48,084 --> 00:26:51,021
I usually wrap my meal up
with fermented skate <i>ramyeon</i>.

570
00:26:51,087 --> 00:26:53,223
Maybe because you're a regular.

571
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:55,892
The fermented skate <i>ramyeon</i>
is irresistible.

572
00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:57,093
You enjoy the perks.

573
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,262
-Sir.
-Sir.

574
00:27:00,063 --> 00:27:02,299
<i>We'll have one </i>ramyeon<i>, please.</i>

575
00:27:02,365 --> 00:27:03,366
<i>Got it!</i>

576
00:27:04,401 --> 00:27:07,704
This is how I felt about Chef Cho
when we shot another show in the past…

577
00:27:07,771 --> 00:27:11,207
I think she's very passionate

578
00:27:11,775 --> 00:27:13,577
about Korean cuisine.

579
00:27:13,643 --> 00:27:18,582
When did you start specializing
in Korean cuisine?

580
00:27:18,982 --> 00:27:24,087
I haven't liked foreign food
since I was little.

581
00:27:24,154 --> 00:27:26,389
-I see.
-It was too greasy for me.

582
00:27:26,456 --> 00:27:29,960
Even when I visited
family restaurants as a kid,

583
00:27:30,026 --> 00:27:33,930
I would always have Korean soup at home
because it was too oily.

584
00:27:33,997 --> 00:27:35,632
I would wash it all down.

585
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:39,502
She will eat spicy beef soup
after a fancy meal.

586
00:27:39,569 --> 00:27:43,073
And I love learning about ingredients.

587
00:27:43,139 --> 00:27:45,942
How far have you gone
to get certain ingredients?

588
00:27:46,009 --> 00:27:47,911
Last year, I went to Hongdo Island.

589
00:27:47,978 --> 00:27:49,412
-Really?
-And Heuksando Island.

590
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:51,181
I rode a boat from Mokpo.

591
00:27:51,248 --> 00:27:53,383
-Did you go eat there?
-Yes.

592
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:57,287
Honestly, I was expecting
extremely fermented skate.

593
00:27:57,354 --> 00:27:59,422
But they didn't ferment it as much.

594
00:27:59,489 --> 00:28:00,924
If you go to Mokpo,

595
00:28:00,991 --> 00:28:04,194
they have skates that have been fermented
for over 180 days.

596
00:28:04,261 --> 00:28:07,998
-No way.
-It's full of pink mold on the surface.

597
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,332
It's good for you.

598
00:28:09,766 --> 00:28:12,002
She's too young for this.

599
00:28:12,702 --> 00:28:14,337
She's impossible.

600
00:28:14,404 --> 00:28:15,906
It's here.

601
00:28:15,972 --> 00:28:17,707
-Oh, no.
-Here you go.

602
00:28:17,774 --> 00:28:22,012
FERMENTED SKATE <i>RAMYEON</i>

603
00:28:24,414 --> 00:28:25,448
Thank you.

604
00:28:25,515 --> 00:28:27,284
It has a rich broth.

605
00:28:28,018 --> 00:28:30,787
DIZZY

606
00:28:31,655 --> 00:28:35,091
IT WON'T BE EASY THIS TIME EITHER

607
00:28:35,158 --> 00:28:36,726
Wait, he even added the nose.

608
00:28:39,162 --> 00:28:43,133
SLICES THE SKATE NOSE AND CHEEK

609
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,670
MAKES THE BROTH

610
00:28:47,337 --> 00:28:50,574
BOILS IT WITH <i>RAMYEON</i>

611
00:28:51,474 --> 00:28:54,911
FULL OF THE FERMENTED SKATE FLAVOR

612
00:28:56,279 --> 00:29:01,318
FERMENTED SKATE <i>RAMYEON </i>IS READY

613
00:29:01,384 --> 00:29:02,385
<i>Would you like to…</i>

614
00:29:02,986 --> 00:29:04,754
I'll try it. This looks okay.

615
00:29:04,821 --> 00:29:06,056
Then I'll serve you some.

616
00:29:06,122 --> 00:29:07,657
No, you try it first.

617
00:29:08,358 --> 00:29:09,826
-No, let me do it.
-Wait…

618
00:29:10,427 --> 00:29:14,231
TAEHOON IS EXCITED TO SERVE DUJUN

619
00:29:15,165 --> 00:29:17,567
-Stop giving me the nose.
-I'm not.

620
00:29:17,634 --> 00:29:19,436
Stop it. That's enough for me.

621
00:29:19,502 --> 00:29:20,737
Let me first try some.

622
00:29:20,804 --> 00:29:23,506
-Wait, the smell is too strong.
-Just try it.

623
00:29:24,307 --> 00:29:25,609
Dang, the <i>ramyeon…</i>

624
00:29:25,675 --> 00:29:27,878
-It doesn't smell normal.
-It's overpowering.

625
00:29:27,944 --> 00:29:31,314
Why don't we go all in on this one?

626
00:29:31,381 --> 00:29:33,083
-Is it okay?
-I'm in.

627
00:29:33,149 --> 00:29:36,152
-Let's put the cheek in here.
-In there?

628
00:29:36,219 --> 00:29:37,254
<i>Like shabu-shabu.</i>

629
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,689
<i>-Do we just dunk it?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

630
00:29:40,523 --> 00:29:43,226
<i>The flesh cooks,</i>
<i>and the scent becomes stronger.</i>

631
00:29:43,293 --> 00:29:46,997
THE AMMONIA SMELL INTENSIFIES
WHEN IT IS COOKED

632
00:29:48,031 --> 00:29:52,435
LET'S TRY THE FERMENTED SKATE <i>RAMYEON</i>

633
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:56,706
CHEF CHO SEOHYEONG TAKES THE FIRST BITE

634
00:29:56,773 --> 00:29:58,775
Wait, I can't stop coughing.

635
00:29:59,509 --> 00:30:00,510
How strong is it?

636
00:30:02,879 --> 00:30:03,880
STARTS COUGHING

637
00:30:03,947 --> 00:30:04,948
Do you feel it?

638
00:30:06,416 --> 00:30:08,919
THE NEWBIE JUST STARTS EATING

639
00:30:08,985 --> 00:30:10,186
The smell just…

640
00:30:11,955 --> 00:30:15,091
-You can't slurp the noodles.
-What is this?

641
00:30:15,158 --> 00:30:16,793
-You can't do that.
-Exactly.

642
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,528
It's good.

643
00:30:20,096 --> 00:30:21,364
But you keep crying.

644
00:30:21,431 --> 00:30:23,533
It tastes so spicy. How is this possible?

645
00:30:24,701 --> 00:30:26,002
MEANWHILE, MINSEONG LOVES IT

646
00:30:26,069 --> 00:30:27,938
-Spiciness is a type of pain.
-Right.

647
00:30:30,941 --> 00:30:32,375
My mouth hurts.

648
00:30:33,376 --> 00:30:36,046
When you have <i>ramyeon </i>or stew,

649
00:30:36,112 --> 00:30:38,248
you have to add leftover skate.

650
00:30:38,315 --> 00:30:40,116
TEARY

651
00:30:40,183 --> 00:30:41,818
-Eat it with the cheek.
-Want more?

652
00:30:41,885 --> 00:30:43,186
I'll do it.

653
00:30:43,253 --> 00:30:45,755
COUGH

654
00:30:45,822 --> 00:30:46,923
This is intense.

655
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,258
<i>The broth is killing us.</i>

656
00:30:48,325 --> 00:30:51,528
<i>The smell of fermented skate</i>
<i>is a lot to take in.</i>

657
00:30:52,529 --> 00:30:53,730
<i>It comes all at once.</i>

658
00:30:54,698 --> 00:30:57,167
Sip the broth slowly, letting air in.

659
00:30:57,234 --> 00:31:01,104
DUJUN GRADUALLY GETS USED TO IT

660
00:31:02,706 --> 00:31:03,873
-What's wrong?
-What?

661
00:31:04,808 --> 00:31:05,909
It's just weird.

662
00:31:06,576 --> 00:31:07,577
It's very…

663
00:31:07,644 --> 00:31:09,279
TAKES ANOTHER SPOONFUL OF THE BROTH

664
00:31:09,346 --> 00:31:11,481
It's super tingly.

665
00:31:12,349 --> 00:31:13,383
It's fascinating.

666
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:15,118
It's the Sichuan pepper of Korea.

667
00:31:15,185 --> 00:31:16,653
SIMILAR TO SICHUAN PEPPER

668
00:31:18,722 --> 00:31:21,658
-Now I get why you said it's like <i>mala</i>.
-Right?

669
00:31:21,725 --> 00:31:24,527
Eating <i>mala </i>feels like
an electric buzz in your mouth.

670
00:31:25,128 --> 00:31:26,997
But this is just numbing.

671
00:31:27,063 --> 00:31:31,268
<i>It's way more stinging than </i>mala<i>.</i>

672
00:31:31,334 --> 00:31:33,203
IT'S ADDICTING THE MORE YOU TRY IT

673
00:31:34,104 --> 00:31:36,406
Can I tell people
I can eat fermented skate?

674
00:31:36,473 --> 00:31:38,041
Do you approve?

675
00:31:38,108 --> 00:31:40,911
-You can say you've tried the real deal.
-Really?

676
00:31:40,977 --> 00:31:42,946
And don't forget to say you cried.

677
00:31:44,681 --> 00:31:46,650
Tears were running down your face.

678
00:31:46,716 --> 00:31:48,285
This is so much fun.

679
00:31:48,351 --> 00:31:50,954
We had the ultimate
fermented skate experience.

680
00:31:51,021 --> 00:31:54,791
-We had an amazing meal thanks to her.
-You really got your blood pumping.

681
00:31:54,858 --> 00:31:56,693
-You're sweating it all out.
-Right.

682
00:31:58,728 --> 00:32:00,397
<i>-I have a question for you.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

683
00:32:00,463 --> 00:32:03,300
<i>What does this go-to spot mean to you?</i>

684
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,370
When I first heard
I would be sharing my go-to spot,

685
00:32:07,771 --> 00:32:10,373
I wasn't sure
which restaurant to recommend.

686
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,876
It should be a place
that satisfies everyone.

687
00:32:12,943 --> 00:32:14,144
Nobody will say,

688
00:32:14,678 --> 00:32:16,413
"That was a bit disappointing."

689
00:32:16,479 --> 00:32:19,216
I think that's what I call my go-to spot.

690
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:23,253
So, I really wanted
to introduce this place to you.

691
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,822
Chef Cho Seohyeong brought us here

692
00:32:25,889 --> 00:32:28,658
because this is a famous
fermented skate place.

693
00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:33,063
I also agree that this is
the best fermented skate I've had.

694
00:32:33,129 --> 00:32:35,131
-I see.
-It was absolutely scrumptious.

695
00:32:35,532 --> 00:32:39,402
Personally, I think it was
such an interesting experience.

696
00:32:39,469 --> 00:32:42,973
-I would never try this by myself.
-Right.

697
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,108
Because I'm not used to this.

698
00:32:45,175 --> 00:32:49,779
But thanks to everyone's help and support,

699
00:32:49,846 --> 00:32:52,849
I was able to truly
enjoy trying this food.

700
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,819
Thanks to Chef Cho,

701
00:32:57,053 --> 00:33:02,092
I feel like Dujun had an eye-opening
experience with fermented skate.

702
00:33:02,158 --> 00:33:03,894
-Right.
-You will remember this later.

703
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,063
-Now I'll probably eat it when I see it.
-Absolutely.

704
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:10,400
I'm glad you enjoyed these dishes.

705
00:33:10,467 --> 00:33:13,503
-You did a great job.
-It was all right.

706
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:15,138
Thank you for the amazing food.
