1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,370
CREATOR OF FLAVORS

2
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:05,138
AND THE MAESTRO

3
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:06,907
OF THE KITCHEN IS

4
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:08,842
THE CHEF

5
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:11,378
BUT WHERE DO THE CHEFS GO
WHEN THEY EAT OUT?!

6
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:14,214
OUT OF SOUTH KOREA'S 560,000 EATERIES

7
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:16,917
WHAT DO THE CHEFS EAT?

8
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:19,820
TO VISIT THE REAL GO-TO EATERIES OF CHEFS

9
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:23,590
HERE COME THE FIVE FOODIE BROTHERS

10
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:27,060
THE DRAGON KING OF YEOUIDO
THE ELDEST CHEF KIM MINSEONG

11
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,229
"THE INGREDIENTS DECIDE
THE FLAVOR OF THE DISH"

12
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:30,397
That is salted seafood.

13
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,932
It's the muscle that hold the…

14
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:34,101
IMPARTING ALL KINDS OF FOODIE KNOWLEDGE

15
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:36,470
You can't say that stuff
when we're eating.

16
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,540
You need to know what you're eating,
Self-Made Chef.

17
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:43,043
MEAT MASTER
THE SECOND CHEF DAVID LEE

18
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,178
It's chicken gizzard.

19
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:45,779
A SWEET GUY WHO PUTS OTHERS FIRST

20
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:46,880
It's everywhere.

21
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:48,182
THE FATHER FIGURE OF CHEFS

22
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:50,284
It tastes like
hot spicy fish soup. Try it.

23
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,386
-It's spicy but light.
-It's got a kick.

24
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:56,056
SELF-MADE CHEF
THE THIRD CHEF LIM TAEHOON

25
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:58,125
I have a nickname for Minseong now.

26
00:00:58,192 --> 00:00:59,326
The Omnivore Chef.

27
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,662
You don't need
to make it obvious you're old.

28
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:03,630
Turn the cameras away.

29
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:06,600
I was going to keep this recipe to myself.

30
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:09,870
If I have perilla leaves,
I grill them here.

31
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,840
COOKING MANIAC
THE YOUNGEST CHEF YOON NAMNO

32
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:16,043
If I had a straw this big,
I'd just slurp it like this.

33
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:19,079
To fully enjoy the food,
make sure to get a good mouthful.

34
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,449
Can I get a bit of soy sauce
in that plate?

35
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:23,517
FROM SPECIAL SAUCES

36
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:24,585
It thickens up.

37
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,019
It's like a Korean mojito.

38
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,087
TO EVEN COCKTAILS

39
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:29,189
You've lost too much weight.

40
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,892
ACTOR FROM LET'S EAT
THE FOURTH YOON DUJUN

41
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,727
I have a small appetite.

42
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:36,930
DEVELOPS AN APPETITE FOR FOOD

43
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:38,866
This is insane.

44
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,401
It's so good I can't stop eating.

45
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:44,338
How do you eat it?
Could you share some flavor pairings?

46
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:48,075
Like tapioca pearls in bubble tea,
you can't stop eating them.

47
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:50,444
WHICH CHEF'S GO-TO WILL IT BE?

48
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:52,946
<i>-Let's go find a world-class auntie.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

49
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:55,249
<i>She's like my secret sister.</i>

50
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,317
<i>They're the best teppanyaki chef.</i>

51
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,554
Nobody I've taken here
has ever been disappointed.

52
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:01,788
It's been over 30 years.

53
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,290
As a child, I went with my mom.

54
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:05,692
-There's always a line.
-To eat here?

55
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,060
Are we almost there?

56
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,562
Hello.

57
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,697
-Is it here?
-The vibe here is amazing.

58
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:11,765
It's this place.

59
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:13,166
COMING RIGHT UP

60
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:17,638
CHEF'S GO-TO

61
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,974
DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL

62
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:25,379
THE FOODIE BROTHERS VISITING
GYEONGDONG MARKET ARE?

63
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,415

64
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:31,451

THE YOUNGEST: YOON NAMNO

66
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:39,493
THE THREE FOODIE BROTHERS HEAD
TO THE FIRST CHEF'S GO-TO PLACE

67
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,529
-We're here at Gyeongdong Market.
-We are.

68
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:47,067
We're going to meet today's guest chef.

69
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:48,802
Which of you invited them?

70
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,804
It was me.

71
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:53,373
I was thinking,

72
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,044
if we're introducing
chefs' favorite eateries,

73
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,279
we might as well start
with our favorite auntie.

74
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,048
Is she at Gyeongdong Market?

75
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,650
Yes, she's the Gyeongdong Auntie.

76
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,386
-Isn't she a world-class auntie?
-Are we making it

77
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,255
-too obvious?
-I think I know.

78
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:09,356
-Of course.
-Yes.

79
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,861
GYEONGDONG MARKET'S WORLD-CLASS AUNTIE

80
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:18,632
WHO COULD SHE BE?

81
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,968
If you don't know her,
you deserve a nuggie.

82
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,604
-Let's go see.
-Everyone knows her.

83
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,806
We should look around
Gyeongdong Market too.

84
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,441
Let's go.

85
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:28,642
LET'S GO MEET AUNTIE

86
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,612
<i>I haven't been to a market in ages.</i>

87
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,848
<i>It feels so nostalgic</i>
<i>to come to a market again.</i>

88
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:38,118
<i>They have a lot of pig trotters here.</i>

89
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:39,386
It's fried on the spot.

90
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:40,554
FROM CRISPY FRIED DISHES

91
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:43,223
<i>Markets are all about</i>
<i>the sweet pancake, aren't they?</i>

92
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,558
TO SWEET PANCAKE

93
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:49,296
A lot of young people
come to markets these days.

94
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:50,430
-You're right.
-Right.

95
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:51,565
Young students, too.

96
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,233
-But markets…
-Gyeongdong Market,

97
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,968
Gwangjang Market, Mangwon Market.

98
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,470
-They're date spots now.
-True.

99
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:00,908
Wow, that looks dangerous.

100
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,143
GULP

101
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:07,014
FRIED CHICKEN THAT LOOKS DANGEROUSLY GOOD

102
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:11,518
GOLDEN AND CRISPY

103
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:12,920
This is great.

104
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,655
Do you hear that?

105
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:16,990
-Looks delicious.
-This sound.

106
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,692
-Is it raining?
-It sounds amazing.

107
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,761
That frying smell is amazing.

108
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,696
THE SOUND ALONE IS COMFORTING

109
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,231
The large portion is 18,000 won.

110
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:27,067
-It's a bargain.
-Is that the large?

111
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:28,769
The portions are huge.

112
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:30,204
It's enough for one person.

113
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,207
MARKET FRIED CHICKEN LOOKS INSANELY GOOD

114
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,009
By the way, our guest chef…

115
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,679
-Isn't she waiting in the rain?
-She'll be waiting for us.

116
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:41,548
Let's eat as we go, right from the bag.

117
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:42,616
-Shall we?
-Yes.

118
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:44,518
ENDED UP ORDERING A LARGE FRIED CHICKEN

119
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:46,153
Ma'am, can I pay with this?

120
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:49,356
A WHOLE CHICKEN GOES INTO THE POT

121
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:52,726
Local chicken joints used to fry them up
like this back in the day.

122
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,596
WITH SWEET POTATOES

123
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,064
Looks delicious.

124
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,966
-What's that? Chicken gizzards?
-Yes.

125
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,201
-They fry them with chili peppers?
-How unique.

126
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:02,669
Rice cakes, too.

127
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:03,737
Five ingredients.

128
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:05,606
It looks so good.

129
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:06,974
A GENEROUS MARKET PORTION

130
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,775
You just know it's going to be good.

131
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,245
That oily aroma is driving me crazy.

132
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:14,982
I really missed that paper packaging.

133
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,116
The brown bag, right?

134
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,619
I love how they roll it down like that.

135
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:19,887
ROLL THE BAG DOWN

136
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:21,355
I'm sold on that vibe alone.

137
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,323
PREVENT IT FROM GETTING SOGGY

138
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,591
Try it.

139
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,529
It smells amazing.
The chili pepper smells so inviting.

140
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,197
Wow, you're right.

141
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:33,567
A BAG FULL OF DELICIOUS AROMA
WITH A HINT OF CHILI PEPPER

142
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:36,837
THE YOUNGEST GETS THE FIRST BITE

143
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:39,139
That flavor is so nostalgic.

144
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,575
BLOW TO COOL IT DOWN

145
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,544
It's chicken gizzard.

146
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,845
-It's fine.
-My gizzard!

147
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:49,917
NOD OF SATISFACTION

148
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,720
WING, I CHOOSE YOU

149
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:58,759
It's way too hot.

150
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:02,963
I heard someone roar.

151
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:07,801
Hot food like this
tastes even better when it burns you.

152
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,970
You have to burn the roof of your mouth.

153
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,605
It needs to scorch your throat.

154
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:16,376
It's delicious.

155
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,412
THE ROOF OF HIS MOUTH IS GETTING BURNED

156
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,180
-It's so good.
-It's really good.

157
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:22,282
Shall we keep going?

158
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:23,650
They'll be waiting for us.

159
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,386
<i>How was the fried chicken?</i>

160
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:27,487
<i>-I approve.</i>
<i>-I approve.</i>

161
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:28,555
<i>It's so good.</i>

162
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:34,027
WHERE IS OUR WORLD-CLASS AUNTIE?

163
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:35,229
Where is it?

164
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:37,331
This way. If we go here…

165
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:40,200
-It's in the basement?
-Yes.

166
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:41,835
THE BASEMENT OF GYEONGDONG MARKET?

167
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,303
At this point, it really is…

168
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,441
so obvious.

169
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:51,345
This place was always popular, right?

170
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:52,546
-Yes.
-Always had a line.

171
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:53,947
It's always been famous.

172
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:58,285
WHO IS OUR FIRST GUEST CHEF
WAITING IN THE BASEMENT MARKET?

173
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:02,322
Chop-chop, get a move on. Honestly.

174
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:03,924
Sis!

175
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:06,693
Because of you, I can't get off--

176
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,195
-Hello.
-…welcome.

177
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,464
Hello, nice to meet you.

178
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:12,533
Welcome. Oh my, hello.

179
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:13,834
Oh my, hello.

180
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:15,502
TODAY'S GUEST AT LAST

181
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,007
THE K-AUNTIE CHEF
FAMOUS FOR HER GYEONGDONG MARKET NOODLES

182
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:25,279
WHO ALSO RUNS A KOREAN CUISINE OMAKASE
AND HAS BEEN COOKING KOREAN FOOD FOREVER

183
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,882
WORLD-CLASS AUNTIE
KIM MIRYEONG

184
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,584
You kept me from clocking out.

185
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:32,019
-Sorry.
-You should've hustled.

186
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:35,022
-We got sidetracked by fried chicken.
-On our way here.

187
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,191
Why did you eat that before coming here?

188
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:39,426
We were told we couldn't just pass by.

189
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:40,494
Honestly.

190
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:42,362
What do we do? Do we sit down?

191
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,332
Sit down for what? I need to get off work.

192
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:48,168
Where are we going?
Can you give us a hint?

193
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:49,603
What hint? Just follow me.

194
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,739
You came here to visit
my favorite place, didn't you?

195
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,141
-Yes, we did.
-We did.

196
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,576
-That's correct.
-Then, come.

197
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:56,810
Just trust me.

198
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:58,345
-I'll…
-She sounds confident.

199
00:07:58,412 --> 00:08:00,414
This place must be really good.

200
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,482
Come on, let's go.

201
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:06,186
WHERE IS CHEF KIM MIRYEONG'S GO-TO?

202
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,791
I have walked this path
since I was in middle school.

203
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:15,362
I'd be wearing my backpack
and would eat there when I was hungry.

204
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:18,799
After I became an adult,
I would go there to drink soju.

205
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:19,867
Then,

206
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,102
-this is Auntie's go-to place.
-Yes.

207
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,570
Auntie's go-to place.

208
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,572
-A real auntie's place.
-Yes.

209
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,741
Auntie Omakase's go-to place.

210
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,444
After I close up for the day,

211
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,980
I walk this way
and stop by on my way home.

212
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,414
<i>It's your regular hangout.</i>

213
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:35,983
<i>Yes, exactly.</i>

214
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,651
<i>It really is my regular hangout.</i>

215
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:39,720
<i>And most importantly,</i>

216
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,122
<i>I went every day back then,</i>
<i>and I still do now.</i>

217
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,325
-You know each other's history.
-Of course.

218
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:47,361
And so,

219
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:49,963
I always walk this route, and…

220
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,533
Hello.

221
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:54,635
-Is it here? Hello.
-Here?

222
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:57,638
-The vibe here is insane.
-Nice, right?

223
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,506
This place is a vibe.

224
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:03,510
AUNTIE'S GO-TO IS?

225
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:04,945
I love outdoor dining.

226
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,247
Should we sit here like this?

227
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,083
<i>What really struck me was that</i>

228
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:11,852
<i>there's no sign.</i>

229
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,521
IN A GYEONGDONG MARKET ALLEY WITH NO SIGN

230
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:20,727
A HAVEN FOR HUNGRY PASSERSBY

231
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,162
How many years has it been?

232
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,798
You moved in after Gyeongdong Market
first opened, right?

233
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,934
-Of course.
-So, 40 to 50 years.

234
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,101
Exactly.

235
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:30,103
A SPOT WITH 50 YEARS OF HISTORY

236
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,707
HOW LONG HAS OUR GUEST CHEF
BEEN A REGULAR?

237
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:37,010
I ate here back when I was a student,

238
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,078
when I was on dates,

239
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:39,847
after I got married and had children.

240
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:40,948
-Even now.
-Even now.

241
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,683
She came with her belly this big.

242
00:09:43,217 --> 00:09:46,820
I'd come here and quickly eat
with my husband before returning home.

243
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:48,488
Because my in-laws are home.

244
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:49,756
If you go home too late,

245
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,491
-they won't like that.
-Exactly.

246
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:54,962
We never got to sit down
and enjoy a drink together,

247
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:57,097
but we were always welcomed here.

248
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:58,999
It was like your safe haven.

249
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:02,803
MY GO-TO, MY SAFE HAVEN

250
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,572
Then, did you see
all the boyfriends she dated?

251
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,008
I only had one boyfriend.

252
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,278
Can we each get a bottle of beer and soju?

253
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:13,013
Look at her changing the subject.

254
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:18,151
CHEF KIM MIRYEONG'S FIRST ORDER
SOMAEK, SOJU AND BEER

255
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:21,321
SOMAEK TO COOL YOU DOWN

256
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:22,890
That's going to taste so good.

257
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:27,227
After I get off work,
especially in summer,

258
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,062
nothing beats having a glass of this.

259
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,198
It's like being rewarded
for your hard work.

260
00:10:31,265 --> 00:10:33,367
-First, on an empty stomach.
-Yes, exactly.

261
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:34,535
Come in.

262
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:35,969
COME FILL MY EMPTY STOMACH

263
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,239
FIRST DRINK AT THE CHEF'S GO-TO

264
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,041
I'm very picky about <i>somaek.</i>

265
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:44,111
This is the most perfect ratio
of beer and soju I've had this year.

266
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:45,379
First of all,

267
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,681
the soju and beer came from the freezer.

268
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,750
AN ICE-COLD DRINK TO BLOW YOUR MIND

269
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:53,620
She always gives me the coldest ones,
whether it's winter or summer.

270
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:55,489
WHAT'S AFTER THE GLASS OF SOMAEK?

271
00:10:55,556 --> 00:10:57,824
I sell noodles, but what else do I serve?

272
00:10:57,925 --> 00:10:59,026
-Omakase.
-That's right.

273
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,761
We'll be having omakase here too.

274
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,930
KIM MIRYEONG'S RECOMMENDATION
5-COURSE OMAKASE

275
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,365
-A plate of my usual <i>sundae</i>, please.
-Okay.

276
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:08,502
PLUMP SUNDAE, KOREAN BLOOD SAUSAGE

277
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:10,637
RICH PORK LIVER

278
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:12,673
TENDER PORK LUNG

279
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,842
CHEWY PORK MAWS

280
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:18,879
SEOUL-STYLE SALT
AND A SPRINKLE OF NUTTY SESAME SEEDS

281
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,017
OMAKASE SECOND DISH
ASSORTED SUNDAE WITH SESAME SEEDS

282
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:26,086
-Have a taste.
-You first, David.

283
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:27,788
Please, go ahead.

284
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:29,022
Let's eat.

285
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:34,494
DIP THE SAVORY SUNDAE IN SESAME SALT

286
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:36,997
Delicious.

287
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:40,133
I've been craving this kind of <i>sundae.</i>

288
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,436
-Real market stall <i>sundae</i>.
-Exactly.

289
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:48,642
THE SECOND STARTS WITH A PIECE OF LIVER

290
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,545
It's really fresh.

291
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:54,081
It doesn't smell at all.

292
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,250
THE YOUNGEST CHECKS THE SMELL FIRST

293
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:00,487
With <i>sundae</i>, you can tell right away
if it is fresh,

294
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,656
when you try the liver first.

295
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:03,957
-The liver?
-Yes.

296
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:06,727
TO CHECK IF THE SUNDAE IS FRESH,
CHECK THE LIVER FIRST

297
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:10,197
I always order this first
because I miss meals while working

298
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:12,533
and I'm really hungry
by the time I get here.

299
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,401
So I order what can be served quickly.

300
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:16,103
All she has to do is cut them.

301
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:17,571
So I get the <i>sundae </i>first.

302
00:12:17,638 --> 00:12:19,006
The soup comes out right away.

303
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:23,443
TO SATISFY YOUR POST-WORK APPETITE

304
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:27,047
THE ASSORTED SUNDAE
IS SERVED IN AN INSTANT

305
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:29,082
Shall we try the next dish?

306
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,284
On to the next dish.

307
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,353
You've never tried lung slices
and pork skin before, have you?

308
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,688
-Lung?
-Have you tried it?

309
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:37,724
-Only in pork and rice soup.
-The one in pork and rice soup

310
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,626
-are pork lungs. This is beef.
-Beef.

311
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:41,562
-Beef?
-This is beef lung.

312
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:44,431
PORK LUNG
MAY HAVE A STRONG SMELL OF PORK

313
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:46,500
BUT HAS A SOFT AND TENDER TEXTURE

314
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:49,436
BEEF LUNG
HAS A CHEWY TEXTURE AND NUTTY FLAVOR

315
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:51,672
People tend to mix them up.

316
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:54,608
This is beef lung, not pork lung.

317
00:12:54,675 --> 00:12:56,276
PEOPLE ENJOY IT AS A DELICACY

318
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:59,813
AFTER STIR-FRYING THE BEEF LUNG WITH SAUCE

319
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:02,282
Then come the perilla leaves.

320
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,752
That's how it's done,
with garlic and chili flakes.

321
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:06,987
All of them look so good.

322
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:11,892
She adds in the pork skin
as a special treat for regulars.

323
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:14,728
Pork skin and beef lung.

324
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,830
JIGGLE

325
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:21,635
OMAKASE THIRD DISH
STIR-FRIED BEEF LUNG WITH PORK SKIN

326
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:23,270
OMAKASE
1. PRE-MEAL SOMAEK

327
00:13:23,337 --> 00:13:26,640
2. ASSORTED SUNDAE
3. STIR-FRIED BEEF LUNG WITH PORK SKIN

328
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:28,709
…it becomes tough.

329
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:31,512
CAN'T HELP BUT SQUEAL

330
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:32,813
It melts away.

331
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:39,186
THE YOUNGEST TAKES A BIG BITE
OF BEEF LUNG AND PORK SKIN

332
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,489
COVERED IN SAUCE

333
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:44,091
-Miryeong.
-Just look at him.

334
00:13:45,726 --> 00:13:47,094
-Look at him.
-Namno.

335
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,495
What? Do I have…

336
00:13:48,562 --> 00:13:50,030
It's all over your face.

337
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:54,201
This sauce looks spicy and strong.

338
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:55,602
But it's not at all.

339
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:56,703
Not at all.

340
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:59,873
In fact, it has that kick,
but it's still delicate.

341
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:03,010
-It tastes like hot spicy fish soup<i>.</i>
-You're right.

342
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:05,078
-It's spicy but light.
-It's got a kick.

343
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,813
SPICY YET LIGHT STIR-FRIED BEEF LUNG

344
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,315
And the pork skin.

345
00:14:09,283 --> 00:14:12,152
-It's so big and thick.
-But it's not tough at all.

346
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:14,054
-Yes, it's soft.
-It's soft, right?

347
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:15,923
SOFT AND TENDER PORK SKIN

348
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:18,759
We need to put these away and go for soju.

349
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:20,928
CHEF KIM MIRYEONG PAIRS
THE DRINK TO THE DISH

350
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:23,864
I should really blow off some steam today.

351
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:26,867
STIR-FRIED BEEF LUNG PAIRED WITH SOJU

352
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:28,502
This is where it really starts.

353
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:32,773
Let's drink a glass of soju.

354
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:35,008
-Cheers.
-Yes.

355
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:37,811
-Thank you.
-It feels great to be with you all today.

356
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:39,847
It's nice out today with the soft drizzle.

357
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:41,114
The rain makes it perfect.

358
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:42,449
-Yes.
-It really does.

359
00:14:42,516 --> 00:14:43,951
PERFECT RAINY NIGHT FOR A DRINK

360
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:49,323
A GLASS OF SOJU TO THE SOUND OF RAIN

361
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,091
This is new for you, isn't it, Dujun?

362
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:52,960
Yes, a real old-school place like this.

363
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,428
It's your first time, right?

364
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:56,430
I'm glad to see you're happy.

365
00:14:56,496 --> 00:15:00,234
THE FOODIE BROTHERS ENJOY NOSTALGIC DISHES
AT AUNTIE'S FAVORITE SPOT

366
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,702
Auntie,

367
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:03,337
can I have some perilla leaves?

368
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:05,305
Wrap this in the leaves. It's delicious.

369
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:06,974
You know this, right?

370
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,609
You shouldn't discard this bit.

371
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:09,776
-Okay.
-I eat that bit.

372
00:15:09,877 --> 00:15:11,879
This is where most of the nutrients are.

373
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:14,248
-The scent is strongest there, too.
-Exactly.

374
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:15,816
This show is really great.

375
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,618
I get all the pro tips.

376
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:23,490
I WANT A PERILLA LEAF WRAP TOO

377
00:15:23,557 --> 00:15:25,959
Hold on. I'll make you one.

378
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,898
A BIG SLICE OF BEEF LUNG
THE PERFECT SIZE FOR NAMNO'S MOUTH

379
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:33,934
I see you two have gotten really close
since I last saw you.

380
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:35,502
-We were always close.
-Always.

381
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:38,238
Still, isn't feeding each other
a bit too much?

382
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:42,509
PONDERING

383
00:15:42,576 --> 00:15:44,745
WHAT DO I DO?

384
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:45,812
It's for you.

385
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:48,949
-It's too big.
-What?

386
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:50,217
She rejected it.

387
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:51,685
FIRM REFUSAL

388
00:15:51,752 --> 00:15:53,620
-It's too big.
-What?

389
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:54,788
She rejected it.

390
00:15:54,855 --> 00:15:56,056
But they're all big.

391
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:58,892
"It's too big." You're so stern.

392
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,295
THE REJECTED WRAP GOES INTO MY MOUTH

393
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:02,663
No need to be so serious.

394
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:04,464
SORRY, DAVID LEE

395
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:05,532
"It's too big."

396
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,768
-It's good.
-Is it good?

397
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:12,606
The thin noodles…

398
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:14,975
-What are they for?
-For the banquet noodles<i>.</i>

399
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,810
-Yes, please.
-No, not yet.

400
00:16:16,877 --> 00:16:18,745
We need to have <i>umutgasari </i>first.

401
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:22,049
We need to eat <i>umutgasari</i>,
then the banquet noodles<i>.</i>

402
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,585
What exactly is <i>umutgasari?</i>

403
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,487
UMUTGASARI: TYPE OF SEAWEED RICH IN FIBER
AND LOW IN CALORIES

404
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:29,690
-That's all <i>umutgasari</i>.
-Like konjac noodles?

405
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:31,258
A little like that.

406
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:33,861
Is this seasoned with soy sauce?

407
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:35,596
With a sweet and tangy soy sauce.

408
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:37,497
With seaweed flakes.

409
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:40,934
ADD SAVORY SEAWEED AND CHILI FLAKES

410
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:46,507
FINISH OFF WITH FRESH CUCUMBER
AND A SPRINKLE OF SESAME SEEDS

411
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:50,010
The color is like a premium champagne.

412
00:16:50,911 --> 00:16:55,849
OMAKASE
4. UMUTGASARI

413
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,117
To fully enjoy the food,

414
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:59,620
make sure to get a good mouthful.

415
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:00,721
That's true.

416
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:04,758
ONE BIG MOUTHFUL

417
00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:05,859
Just slurp it?

418
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:12,232
DUJUN FOLLOWS SUIT AND SLURPS

419
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:14,768
-It's all washing down nicely.
-It's delicious, right?

420
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:18,705
Some people might not like this texture,

421
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,875
but the cucumber and soy sauce is…

422
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:24,111
-It's sweet and tangy.
-Sweet and tangy.

423
00:17:24,178 --> 00:17:28,749
FRESH CUCUMBER WITH A SWEET-AND-TANGY
SOY SAUCE FOR THAT LITTLE KICK

424
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:31,518
If I had a straw this big,
I'd just slurp it like this.

425
00:17:32,286 --> 00:17:34,354
Like tapioca pearls in bubble tea.

426
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:35,589
-Yes, right.
-Exactly.

427
00:17:35,656 --> 00:17:37,124
You can't stop eating it.

428
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:41,962
Personally, I would order the <i>umutgasari</i>
with the stir-fried beef lung together.

429
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:43,697
Yes, that'd be good.

430
00:17:43,764 --> 00:17:46,733
-When it gets spicy, this cools it down.
-Yes, true.

431
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,869
A COMBINATION THAT BALANCES THE SPICINESS

432
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:55,242
DEVOURING THE ENTIRE BOWL

433
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:57,211
While the nutty flavor is still there,

434
00:17:58,011 --> 00:17:59,379
you wash it down with soju.

435
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:03,217
Chef Yoon likes
to take a bite and then drink it down.

436
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:05,185
-It's a must for me.
-Really?

437
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:07,020
What about you? I'm just…

438
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:08,088
I'm the same.

439
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:10,924
Really? I'm the type to drink first,
then eat some food.

440
00:18:10,991 --> 00:18:12,125
EMPTY GLASS

441
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:16,430
NAMNO IS WORRIED ABOUT DUJUN

442
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:19,433
I should really blow off some steam today.

443
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:20,734
Do you have another glass?

444
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:21,802
-Yes.
-Thank you.

445
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:25,339
Use this one. I'm not much of a drinker.

446
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:26,807
I'll take sips from this.

447
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,576
Just say cheers. No need to drink.

448
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:31,378
-You can just toast.
-Okay.

449
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:33,413
-Just say cheers. Don't drink.
-Got it.

450
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:35,215
Dujun.

451
00:18:35,883 --> 00:18:37,651
You're not great with alcohol,

452
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,053
so I'll use what's here

453
00:18:41,355 --> 00:18:42,990
to make a Korean mojito.

454
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:44,157
A Korean mojito?

455
00:18:45,025 --> 00:18:46,627
There's usually mint in mojitos.

456
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:48,595
-But this is good, too.
-That's true.

457
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:50,063
And these are field-grown,

458
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,100
-so the scent is amazing.
-True. They in season.

459
00:18:53,934 --> 00:18:56,003
It's great going to places with experts.

460
00:18:57,671 --> 00:19:00,541
INTO THE GLASS IT GOES

461
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,278
ADD A LITTLE SOJU AND MASH IT

462
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:05,979
Are you juicing it?

463
00:19:06,046 --> 00:19:08,615
He's crushing it to bring out the aroma.

464
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:12,386
THE RATIO OF ALCOHOL IS
1 PART SOJU

465
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:17,324
2 PARTS LEMON-LIME SODA

466
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:22,229
MIX IT WELL AND IT'S DONE

467
00:19:22,296 --> 00:19:24,398
If you add a slice of lemon,

468
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:26,033
-it'd be perfect.
-Exactly.

469
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:27,134
It's a shame.

470
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:29,469
But this should be okay.

471
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:31,271
What an honor, truly.

472
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:33,974
HOW IS THE KOREAN MOJITO?

473
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,343
-The aroma is…
-Where's mine?

474
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:42,449
How is it? Is it good?

475
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:43,584
Would you like a sip?

476
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,819
It's really good.

477
00:19:48,055 --> 00:19:49,957
You only need lemon-lime soda.

478
00:19:50,991 --> 00:19:52,659
The perilla leaf aroma is so strong.

479
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:55,562
But it does feel like mint.

480
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,498
-I'm telling you.
-It has that minty aroma.

481
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:00,501
-Exactly two to one.
-Two to one?

482
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:01,635
Yes, two parts soda.

483
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:03,704
-One part soju.
-It's good.

484
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:04,771
Then ice.

485
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:09,076
AUNTIE IS CURIOUS

486
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:10,143
Is it good?

487
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,612
No, it's all right.

488
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:14,214
CURIOSITY GOT THE BETTER OF HER

489
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:16,383
-Just a little.
-You were cooking up something?

490
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,451
That's enough.

491
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:18,785
-He was.
-I was.

492
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:20,120
You were?

493
00:20:20,187 --> 00:20:22,122
I should drink it like this too.
It's good.

494
00:20:23,023 --> 00:20:24,892
It's delicious. No, really.

495
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,293
My, it's good.

496
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,928
-Isn't he brilliant?
-He sure is.

497
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:32,032
THAT'S RIGHT, I'M MR. BRILLIANT

498
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:35,068
Now, we've eaten quite a bit.

499
00:20:35,135 --> 00:20:36,870
We always finish with banquet noodles<i>.</i>

500
00:20:36,937 --> 00:20:38,238
-Of course.
-Banquet noodles<i>?</i>

501
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,943
BLANCH THE COOKED NOODLES
INSIDE THE ANCHOVY BROTH

502
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:47,915
FINISH BY ADDING THE RICH BROTH
THAT HAS BEEN SIMMERING ALL DAY

503
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:52,920
OMAKASE
5. BANQUET NOODLES

504
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:55,589
Here, the kimchi.

505
00:20:55,656 --> 00:20:58,859
-You have to add this on top…
-It's a must.

506
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:01,228
…to make the banquet noodles come alive.

507
00:21:01,295 --> 00:21:05,666
ONE SLURP OF NOODLES

508
00:21:08,135 --> 00:21:10,804
This is what you call real anchovy broth.

509
00:21:13,507 --> 00:21:16,310
Usually, people use anchovy flavoring.

510
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:19,213
THE RICH BROTH HAS HIM
SQUEALING WITH DELIGHT

511
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,314
It's so delicious.

512
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:22,916
I think I get why

513
00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:24,685
-the noodles come at the end.
-Right?

514
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:25,853
It settles everything.

515
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:30,657
FINISH IT OFF WITH NOODLES
WITH SPICY MINCED SEASONING

516
00:21:30,724 --> 00:21:32,125
We started with <i>sundae.</i>

517
00:21:32,192 --> 00:21:34,261
It was rich in taste,

518
00:21:34,328 --> 00:21:36,496
but still mild
because it wasn't marinated.

519
00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:39,366
-We only had salt.
-Exactly. That's how you should start.

520
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:43,337
The second dish was beef lung,
which was spicy in flavor.

521
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:47,307
Next came <i>umutgasari</i>,
which cleansed the palate.

522
00:21:49,209 --> 00:21:50,410
Lastly, the noodles.

523
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,880
It wraps everything up
and settles the stomach.

524
00:21:53,614 --> 00:21:55,182
You can carry the warmth home.

525
00:21:55,249 --> 00:21:58,619
A SIMPLE YET SPECIAL
BOWL OF BANQUET NOODLES

526
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:02,689
A PLACE TO ENJOY OMAKASE MADE WITH WARMTH

527
00:22:02,756 --> 00:22:05,292
The reason I love coming here

528
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:08,262
isn't just the delicious food,
but for the energy and love.

529
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:10,564
What I mean is, in these harsh times,

530
00:22:10,631 --> 00:22:14,134
she's stayed right here,
serving food with the same warmth.

531
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:15,435
It must be so comforting.

532
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:17,671
I run a restaurant myself.

533
00:22:17,738 --> 00:22:21,775
But I come here and think I should serve
customers with the same warmth tomorrow.

534
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:25,045
That's the resolve this place gives me.

535
00:22:25,112 --> 00:22:26,680
You know, your regular spot

536
00:22:27,381 --> 00:22:28,782
is like a friend.

537
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:29,983
That's so true.

538
00:22:31,652 --> 00:22:34,755
After I hit 40,

539
00:22:36,123 --> 00:22:38,058
I scanned my contacts list,

540
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:40,961
looking to see who I could meet up with.

541
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:44,331
Friends I can just casually
call for a drink

542
00:22:44,398 --> 00:22:46,567
are few enough to count on one hand.

543
00:22:47,267 --> 00:22:50,003
Of those friends, my closest one fell ill
and passed on.

544
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,104
Oh dear.

545
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:56,376
So when I saw you here today,

546
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:58,512
with your very own auntie…

547
00:22:58,579 --> 00:23:00,447
AN AUNTIE I CAN ALWAYS VISIT

548
00:23:00,514 --> 00:23:03,183
-She really is my very own auntie.
-…I felt

549
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,686
a little envious that you have this joy.

550
00:23:05,752 --> 00:23:07,287
It must be really comforting.

551
00:23:07,354 --> 00:23:09,323
MY AUNTIE'S PLACE IS LIKE AN OLD FRIEND

552
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:11,091
I CAN SEE THEM WHENEVER I WANT

553
00:23:11,158 --> 00:23:15,262
I sell noodles too, but I still come here
to eat banquet noodles

554
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:19,499
because I love her warmth.
It's my way of wrapping up my day.

555
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:22,269
A PLACE THAT WRAPS UP MY DAY

556
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:26,039
I don't understand why someone who sells
noodles eats so much noodles here.

557
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:29,510
But she always finishes
with banquet noodles.

558
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:32,779
When I look at those boiled,
slightly soggy noodles,

559
00:23:32,846 --> 00:23:35,148
I think, "They had a hard day, too."

560
00:23:35,215 --> 00:23:37,651
That's how I want to wrap up my day.

561
00:23:37,718 --> 00:23:40,988
A BOWL OF SOGGY NOODLES THAT MIRROR MY DAY

562
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:42,456
I feel tears coming on.

563
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:45,292
They're old memories.

564
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:48,195
CHOKING UP FROM OLD MEMORIES

565
00:23:48,962 --> 00:23:52,199
I SPENT MY YOUTH RUNNING
A RESTAURANT WITH MY HUSBAND

566
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:56,203
THE AUNTIE WHO ALWAYS COMFORTED MY WEARY
HEART AS I JUGGLED PARENTING AND WORK

567
00:23:56,270 --> 00:24:01,108
AND AUNTIE'S BANQUET NOODLES
THAT SO CLOSELY RESEMBLES WHO I AM

568
00:24:01,175 --> 00:24:04,511
It'd be great if you could
share some flavor pairings?

569
00:24:04,578 --> 00:24:09,049
-Oh, flavor pairings?
-How to really enjoy the dishes here.

570
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:10,784
-Just what's here?
-Yes.

571
00:24:10,851 --> 00:24:11,985
Using the dishes here.

572
00:24:12,052 --> 00:24:13,921
FLAVOR PAIRING USING THESE DISHES?

573
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:18,725
-Namno versus David.
-And Miryeong is the judge?

574
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:20,427
Yes. The loser has to do a dare.

575
00:24:20,494 --> 00:24:23,730
COOKING MANIAC YOON NAMNO
VS. MEAT MASTER DAVID LEE

576
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:25,499
Then I'll be judge. Maybe together?

577
00:24:25,566 --> 00:24:26,567
-Be strict.
-Okay.

578
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:28,502
Then what will the dare be?

579
00:24:29,203 --> 00:24:30,704
-Something hardcore.
-Hardcore?

580
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:32,039
You like it wild.

581
00:24:32,105 --> 00:24:33,574
What would be good?

582
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,042
A dance challenge?

583
00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:39,246
THE LOSER WILL FILM AN ADORABLE DARE VIDEO

584
00:24:39,313 --> 00:24:41,481
Do you both have social media accounts?

585
00:24:41,548 --> 00:24:43,317
Yes, you have to upload it there.

586
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:46,320
-The starter often faces the end.
-Really?

587
00:24:46,386 --> 00:24:48,589
THE LOSER WILL POST
ON THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT

588
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:49,857
But for me,

589
00:24:50,924 --> 00:24:53,260
these ingredients aren't enough.

590
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:54,695
I'll go out and buy something.

591
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:56,196
Buy what?

592
00:24:56,263 --> 00:24:58,332
-He's up to something. Go on, then.
-He does.

593
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:01,535
I've been going around TV shows
doing flavor pairings.

594
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:05,072
-The Man of flavor.
-His know-how of pairing.

595
00:25:05,138 --> 00:25:07,140
If you keep combining things
on TV like that,

596
00:25:07,207 --> 00:25:09,243
you might become
a master of matching games.

597
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,546
WHAT WILL HE BUY?

598
00:25:12,613 --> 00:25:15,649
NOT LONG AFTER

599
00:25:15,716 --> 00:25:19,253
Onion, chili pepper, garlic.
Those are usually the basics.

600
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:20,654
-He's back.
-What did you get?

601
00:25:20,721 --> 00:25:22,289
-What did you buy?
-That was quick.

602
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:24,157
A color that suits you well.

603
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,559
Which color is that?

604
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:27,594
A COLOR THAT SUITS CHEF KIM MIRYEONG?

605
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:29,396
-Which color is that?
-Red cap.

606
00:25:29,463 --> 00:25:31,131
Sesame oil!

607
00:25:31,832 --> 00:25:33,634
-I love it.
-Sesame oil.

608
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:36,003
Do you have any soy sauce?

609
00:25:37,237 --> 00:25:38,238
Is this too much?

610
00:25:38,305 --> 00:25:39,306
No, it's good.

611
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:44,178
MIX EQUAL PARTS SOY SAUCE AND SESAME OIL

612
00:25:44,244 --> 00:25:48,282
ADD MINCED GARLIC,
SESAME SEEDS, AND CHILI FLAKES

613
00:25:48,348 --> 00:25:51,818
If you stir like this,
oil doesn't normally mix with liquid.

614
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:52,886
No, it doesn't.

615
00:25:52,953 --> 00:25:54,488
But if you do this,

616
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:56,623
-they call it soy-sesame sauce.
-Yes.

617
00:25:57,858 --> 00:25:59,493
It thickens up.

618
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,929
SOY-SESAME SAUCE
EQUAL PARTS SOY SAUCE AND SESAME OIL

619
00:26:01,995 --> 00:26:03,030
Hold on, and then.

620
00:26:05,699 --> 00:26:07,701
-Is it good?
-It even goes well with soju.

621
00:26:07,768 --> 00:26:08,769
Really?

622
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,438
It'll be good with <i>sundae.</i>

623
00:26:11,505 --> 00:26:14,508
WILL IT GO WELL WITH SUNDAE?

624
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:18,412
ONE BITE OF THE SUNDAE DIPPED IN SAUCE
WILL LEAVE YOU SQUEALING WITH DELIGHT

625
00:26:18,478 --> 00:26:19,813
Wow, it's delicious.

626
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,649
This is like the perfect bite.

627
00:26:22,716 --> 00:26:24,051
It's really good.

628
00:26:24,117 --> 00:26:28,288
THE SECOND HAS A TASTE TOO

629
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,691
It's good.

630
00:26:32,326 --> 00:26:34,027
I don't think I can win against this.

631
00:26:35,796 --> 00:26:36,797
I think I won.

632
00:26:36,864 --> 00:26:38,732
-Game over already.
-What will you do?

633
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:40,667
Come up with something.

634
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:43,370
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

635
00:26:43,437 --> 00:26:47,140
Chef David Lee,
were you cooking up something?

636
00:26:47,207 --> 00:26:48,275
-Yes.
-He was.

637
00:26:48,342 --> 00:26:49,343
I was.

638
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:50,744
-He was.
-I was.

639
00:26:50,811 --> 00:26:51,812
You were?

640
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,115
Could you blanch some noodles

641
00:26:55,182 --> 00:26:56,517
and put them…

642
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:58,218
-In a bowl, please.
-In a bowl.

643
00:26:58,285 --> 00:27:00,387
Don't you need some kind of sauce?

644
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:02,356
This sauce is here, the one you made.

645
00:27:02,422 --> 00:27:03,757
The sauce inside this dish.

646
00:27:03,824 --> 00:27:05,826
-You want that sauce?
-Yes, with cucumber,

647
00:27:05,893 --> 00:27:07,361
some noodles, and this sauce.

648
00:27:08,862 --> 00:27:14,334
ADD GREEN ONION, SEAWEED FLAKES, CUCUMBER
TO THE BLANCHED NOODLES

649
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:18,472
THEN ADD SOME SWEET AND TANGY SOY SAUCE

650
00:27:19,506 --> 00:27:20,741
Perilla gives it that kick.

651
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:22,209
ADD PERILLA LEAVES AND SAUCE

652
00:27:23,877 --> 00:27:25,612
It's amazing how you can just

653
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,216
build new flavors in your head.
I'm jealous.

654
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:35,088
HOW ARE THE BEEF LUNG NOODLES
DAVID COOKED UP?

655
00:27:35,522 --> 00:27:38,058
-Auntie, this is good.
-Is it okay?

656
00:27:45,265 --> 00:27:46,800
WOW! THIS IS LEGIT

657
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:49,336
It's like eating warm spicy mixed noodles.

658
00:27:49,469 --> 00:27:51,271
The perilla aroma really comes through.

659
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:53,240
Because it's been cooked.

660
00:27:53,307 --> 00:27:54,908
The aroma has been fully released.

661
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:57,911
It's spicy but that hint
of vinegar comes through,

662
00:27:57,978 --> 00:28:00,013
so it reminds me of spicy octopus noodles.

663
00:28:01,615 --> 00:28:03,417
Now, please make your pick.

664
00:28:03,483 --> 00:28:06,486
-Shall I pick?
-Who's the winner out of our two chefs?

665
00:28:07,387 --> 00:28:09,423
THE YOUNGEST YOON NAMNO'S

666
00:28:09,489 --> 00:28:10,490
Red cap.

667
00:28:10,557 --> 00:28:12,025
Sesame oil!

668
00:28:12,793 --> 00:28:14,661
-I love it.
-Sesame oil.

669
00:28:14,728 --> 00:28:16,797
SOY-SESAME SAUCE MADE
WITH OIL FROM THE MARKET

670
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:19,666
OR THE SECOND DAVID LEE'S

671
00:28:20,534 --> 00:28:21,768
Perilla gives it that kick.

672
00:28:22,503 --> 00:28:26,840
SPICY MIXED NOODLES
WITH AROMATIC PERILLA LEAVES

673
00:28:26,907 --> 00:28:28,575
Out of our two chefs?

674
00:28:28,642 --> 00:28:31,011
-One must do a dare.
-To be honest, earlier,

675
00:28:31,111 --> 00:28:33,180
when he asked for noodles,
I made up my mind.

676
00:28:33,947 --> 00:28:36,817
The reason being,
chefs never stop at the sauce.

677
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:40,687
-Miryeong.
-But it's true.

678
00:28:40,787 --> 00:28:42,623
-Miryeong.
-I'm right, aren't I?

679
00:28:42,689 --> 00:28:45,092
Stop at soju? I even made a mojito.

680
00:28:45,893 --> 00:28:47,828
-No, stop at the sauce.
-Exactly.

681
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:49,997
You said we can't stop at the sauce.

682
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:52,432
-But I also made a drink.
-No, this drink

683
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:53,901
-was an accompaniment.
-Right.

684
00:28:53,967 --> 00:28:57,437
You need to make a complete dish,
but with Chef David Lee…

685
00:28:58,105 --> 00:28:59,606
-His was a complete dish?
-Yes.

686
00:28:59,673 --> 00:29:00,674
I didn't back down.

687
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:03,177
So you can wrap things up today,

688
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:04,678
while we go home.

689
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:06,713
THE YOUNGEST YOON NAMNO LOSES

690
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,949
-Okay. I admit defeat.
-Today,

691
00:29:09,016 --> 00:29:10,584
just like this gentle breeze,

692
00:29:10,651 --> 00:29:15,722
I revisited old memories
and could savor the joy of this moment,

693
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:17,457
so it was really nice. Wasn't it?

694
00:29:17,524 --> 00:29:19,960
-It was really nice and made me happy.
