CONTAINS SCENES OF ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION

3
00:00:08,318 --> 00:00:12,255
THERE'S A LIGHT BREEZE ON CAMPUS

4
00:00:12,989 --> 00:00:15,625
WHICH FOODIE BROTHERS CAME
TO MYONGJI UNIVERSITY TODAY?

5
00:00:16,192 --> 00:00:17,661
THE FOURTH, YOON DUJUN

6
00:00:18,261 --> 00:00:19,696
THE ELDEST, KIM MINSEONG

7
00:00:20,363 --> 00:00:22,098
THE YOUNGEST, YOON NAMNO

8
00:00:22,165 --> 00:00:26,870
Why are we here
at Myongji University today?

9
00:00:26,937 --> 00:00:30,607
The chef I invited today
told us to come here.

10
00:00:30,674 --> 00:00:33,677
Oh, there are lots of good restaurants
around campuses.

11
00:00:33,743 --> 00:00:36,079
-Right.
-There's good and affordable food.

12
00:00:36,146 --> 00:00:38,715
Hongik University is famous.
Myongji University too.

13
00:00:38,782 --> 00:00:40,250
There are some nice spots.

14
00:00:40,317 --> 00:00:42,018
Good food at reasonable prices.

15
00:00:42,085 --> 00:00:43,253
Here he comes.

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,487
-Hello.
-Hi.

17
00:00:44,554 --> 00:00:46,423
-Hello.
-He's super famous.

18
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:48,491
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

19
00:00:49,426 --> 00:00:52,162
HE WENT FROM BEING
A POLITICAL JOURNALIST TO A CHEF

20
00:00:53,363 --> 00:00:56,733
HE EXPLORES THE WORLD'S CUISINES
AS A FOOD COLUMNIST

21
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,835
JANG JUNWOO'S FOOD ODYSSEY

22
00:00:59,603 --> 00:01:02,439
HE CURRENTLY RUNS A TAPAS BAR
AS THE CHEF-OWNER

23
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,842
CHEF JANG JUNWOO
TELLS STORIES THROUGH FOOD

24
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:08,678
I fell in love with cooking
while I was a journalist.

25
00:01:08,745 --> 00:01:12,082
I'm Jang Junwoo,
a food columnist and chef.

26
00:01:12,148 --> 00:01:13,583
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

27
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,685
Well, he takes incredible pictures.

28
00:01:15,752 --> 00:01:16,753
He takes incredible pictures.

29
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,321
HE BRAGS ABOUT JUNWOO'S PHOTOGRAPHY SKILLS

30
00:01:18,388 --> 00:01:20,490
-Is your go-to place nearby?
-Yes, it is.

31
00:01:20,557 --> 00:01:24,394
Actually, I used to run
a restaurant in this area.

32
00:01:24,461 --> 00:01:27,397
So, my go-to spot is nearby,
and it's super famous.

33
00:01:27,464 --> 00:01:29,332
Any Myongji University student knows it.

34
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:33,536
I'll just pick out a random student here
and ask if they know the place.

35
00:01:33,603 --> 00:01:35,205
-Seriously? Out of the blue?
-Yes.

36
00:01:35,272 --> 00:01:37,340
If they don't know it,
I won't take you there.

37
00:01:37,407 --> 00:01:38,408
All right.

38
00:01:39,042 --> 00:01:40,310
-Look.
-Someone's coming.

39
00:01:40,377 --> 00:01:42,479
I'll ask those two walking by.

40
00:01:42,546 --> 00:01:44,781
-Wow, he's a pro at this.
-Hello.

41
00:01:44,848 --> 00:01:47,050
Hi, do you go to Myongji University?

42
00:01:47,117 --> 00:01:48,285
-Yes.
-Great.

43
00:01:48,351 --> 00:01:50,654
I have a question.
It's my first time here.

44
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,156
Is there a good restaurant nearby?

45
00:01:53,723 --> 00:01:55,725
CONTEMPLATING

46
00:01:56,326 --> 00:01:57,460
WHERE WILL IT BE?

47
00:01:57,527 --> 00:01:59,062
What did she say?

48
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:00,196
Moraenae Gopchang.

49
00:02:00,263 --> 00:02:01,898
-Okay…
-What was the name?

50
00:02:01,965 --> 00:02:02,966
Moraenae Gopchang.

51
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:06,736
That place is also great,
but it's too hot right now.

52
00:02:06,803 --> 00:02:09,339
How about fried chicken?
How about any good fried chicken places?

53
00:02:09,406 --> 00:02:10,440
CHEF JUNWOO KEEPS ASKING

54
00:02:10,507 --> 00:02:12,943
I thought you said you wouldn't go there
if they didn't mention it.

55
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:16,746
-You're narrowing it down.
-Fried chicken?

56
00:02:16,813 --> 00:02:18,415
Wait a second…

57
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:19,916
-Yeongi Bar?
-Yeongi Bar.

58
00:02:19,983 --> 00:02:21,051
That's it.

59
00:02:21,117 --> 00:02:22,519
-Yeongi Bar?
-Yeongi Bar.

60
00:02:22,586 --> 00:02:24,120
That's it.

61
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:29,159
As a former journalist,
you know how to ask leading questions.

62
00:02:29,926 --> 00:02:31,361
How did you discover it?

63
00:02:31,995 --> 00:02:35,999
A senior at school told me about it
while recommending some restaurants.

64
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:39,970
There's always a legendary
fried chicken place around campuses.

65
00:02:40,036 --> 00:02:43,974
-Of course.
-We should go there since it's so famous.

66
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,408
-We have to visit.
-Sure.

67
00:02:45,475 --> 00:02:47,777
-Thank you for the interview.
-Thank you.

68
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:52,115
-Is it called Yeongi Bar?
-Yes.

69
00:02:52,182 --> 00:02:54,484
-Does everyone like fried chicken?
-Absolutely.

70
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:59,389
In this weather, you can't say no
to fried chicken and beer.

71
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,957
-It's just instinct.
-Right.

72
00:03:01,024 --> 00:03:03,260
Wow, I can't believe
it's just around the corner.

73
00:03:03,326 --> 00:03:07,330
-It's just across the street.
-Wow, you're right.

74
00:03:07,397 --> 00:03:09,699
-We're here.
-Wow, I love the sign.

75
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:12,135
You can tell it's a good place
just by the sign.

76
00:03:12,202 --> 00:03:13,236
It's long-standing.

77
00:03:13,303 --> 00:03:16,339
"Yeongi Bar has been here for 30 years."

78
00:03:16,406 --> 00:03:19,376
"We are particular
about everything related to taste."

79
00:03:19,442 --> 00:03:21,811
This isn't a common phrase
for fried chicken spots.

80
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:25,849
-You can see the pressure fryer.
-Oh, is this a pressure fryer?

81
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,852
-Not many places use this.
-Classic chicken spots use this.

82
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,422
This is the old-fashioned way
to deep-fry chicken.

83
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:34,224
Wow, it sure is.

84
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,159
-Hello.
-Hi.

85
00:03:36,226 --> 00:03:37,727
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

86
00:03:37,794 --> 00:03:40,430
-Oh, it's been a long time.
-Yes, it's been a while.

87
00:03:40,497 --> 00:03:41,498
OPEN FOR 45 YEARS

88
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,302
Dang, look at the vibes here…

89
00:03:46,036 --> 00:03:47,304
It's like a film set.

90
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,673
It's hard to even
try to decorate it like this.

91
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:50,907
Look at the chandelier.

92
00:03:51,474 --> 00:03:52,776
This is cool, too.

93
00:03:52,842 --> 00:03:54,444
TONS OF VINTAGE ITEMS

94
00:03:54,511 --> 00:03:55,912
When did you open this place?

95
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:58,248
-Forty-five years ago.
-Really?

96
00:03:58,315 --> 00:04:02,986
-You've run this place since the 1980s.
-That's right.

97
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:06,656
You were born in 1989. I was born in 1990.

98
00:04:06,723 --> 00:04:09,092
-Even before we were born.
-I was born in 1985.

99
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,530
It's probably the oldest fried chicken
restaurant in the country.

100
00:04:13,597 --> 00:04:15,832
-Do you know OB Bear in Euljiro?
-Of course.

101
00:04:15,899 --> 00:04:17,534
That bar opened in 1980.

102
00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:20,537
-This is a long-established place.
-Exactly.

103
00:04:20,604 --> 00:04:22,706
WHAT WILL THEY EAT AT THIS HISTORIC PLACE?

104
00:04:22,772 --> 00:04:25,542
-Since we're hungry, I'll order quickly.
-Sure.

105
00:04:25,609 --> 00:04:27,410
I only eat fried chicken here.

106
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:30,780
But since there are four of us,
let's order one regular fried chicken,

107
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,349
a <i>yangnyeom </i>one, and a curry one.

108
00:04:32,415 --> 00:04:33,550
-Sounds great.
-Thanks.

109
00:04:33,617 --> 00:04:36,620
-And can we get four draft beers, please?
-Got it.

110
00:04:37,354 --> 00:04:40,023
-Did you see the pressure fryer?
-Yes.

111
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,858
It's uncommon to do it like that.

112
00:04:41,925 --> 00:04:43,927
Right. It's a ton of work.

113
00:04:43,994 --> 00:04:47,764
Do you know the first fried chicken
restaurant in the country?

114
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:49,399
-Is it K*C?
-Yes.

115
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,234
K*C was the first to use that.

116
00:04:51,301 --> 00:04:53,036
-Do you know the K*C grandpa?
-Yes.

117
00:04:53,103 --> 00:04:56,973
<i>He used the pressure fryer</i>
<i>to fry the chicken,</i>

118
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,341
and deep-fried it again.

119
00:04:58,408 --> 00:05:01,111
He filed a patent for this,
which later became K*C.

120
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:02,679
And we imported the franchise.

121
00:05:02,746 --> 00:05:05,649
So, all the early fried chicken places
used pressure fryers.

122
00:05:05,715 --> 00:05:08,685
-I see.
-She's still sticking to that method.

123
00:05:08,752 --> 00:05:10,287
Yes, it's the K*C way.

124
00:05:10,987 --> 00:05:13,823
I've never seen it before, so I'm curious.

125
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,925
I'll go see it.

126
00:05:16,293 --> 00:05:17,294
Oh, my.

127
00:05:17,727 --> 00:05:20,030
Ma'am, is this already brined?

128
00:05:20,096 --> 00:05:22,532
Yes, we do it ourselves.

129
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:24,100
The kitchen is super clean.

130
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:27,170
It's been over 40 years,
but it's very clean.

131
00:05:27,237 --> 00:05:29,406
There's absolutely no grease here.

132
00:05:29,472 --> 00:05:31,207
<i>I have to clean every day.</i>

133
00:05:31,274 --> 00:05:34,778
<i>I can't believe it's this clean</i>
<i>after 45 years.</i>

134
00:05:34,844 --> 00:05:37,914
<i>-There's no dishwasher, either.</i>
<i>-I wash everything with my hands.</i>

135
00:05:37,981 --> 00:05:40,116
I've never seen this machine before.

136
00:05:40,684 --> 00:05:41,685
Well, this is…

137
00:05:41,751 --> 00:05:43,520
THIS TYPE OF PRESSURE FRYER
IS HARD TO SEE THESE DAYS

138
00:05:43,587 --> 00:05:48,225
Since it's called a pressure fryer,
I thought it cooked with steam.

139
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,926
-It cooks with oil.
-Really?

140
00:05:53,997 --> 00:05:55,131
THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY

141
00:05:55,198 --> 00:05:57,300
TURN THE HANDLE ON THE LID TO SEAL TIGHTLY

142
00:05:57,367 --> 00:06:00,337
-How long do you cook it like this?
-Twenty minutes.

143
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:01,771
-Really?
-Yes.

144
00:06:02,872 --> 00:06:07,577
THE INSIDE BECOMES EXTREMELY HOT
DUE TO THE HIGH PRESSURE

145
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:15,719
THE CHICKEN COMES OUT MOIST
IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME

146
00:06:16,653 --> 00:06:21,524
GOLDEN BROWN

147
00:06:22,392 --> 00:06:26,563
SHE FRIES THE CHICKEN AGAIN
WHEN A NEW ORDER COMES IN

148
00:06:28,932 --> 00:06:33,069
FRY IT AGAIN IN A DEEP FRYER

149
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,139
IT TAKES ON A CARAMEL COLOR

150
00:06:36,773 --> 00:06:40,477
IT BECOMES CRUNCHIER AND NUTTIER

151
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:46,082
CABBAGE SALAD ON THE SIDE,
WHICH IS A PERFECT PAIRING

152
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:51,955
TOP IT WITH THE CLASSIC COMBO,
KETCHUP, MAYONNAISE, AND CORN

153
00:06:53,957 --> 00:06:59,763
CRISPY OUTSIDE AND JUICY INSIDE,
THE FRIED CHICKEN IS READY

154
00:07:02,265 --> 00:07:04,701
-Thank you.
-Your fried chicken is ready.

155
00:07:04,768 --> 00:07:07,137
NAMNO GETS THE CHICKEN
AS SOON AS IT COMES OUT

156
00:07:07,203 --> 00:07:08,305
It's here.

157
00:07:09,406 --> 00:07:12,542
I love this about old-school eateries.

158
00:07:12,609 --> 00:07:16,413
I love getting the food myself
after they're done making it.

159
00:07:17,347 --> 00:07:18,848
AMAZED

160
00:07:18,915 --> 00:07:20,250
Wow, there's salad.

161
00:07:21,084 --> 00:07:23,687
-The fried coating…
-It's very thin.

162
00:07:23,753 --> 00:07:25,555
It's extremely thin and even.

163
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:31,528
CLASSIC FRIED CHICKEN

164
00:07:33,597 --> 00:07:38,001
SHALL WE HAVE A BITE?

165
00:07:38,068 --> 00:07:39,069
Let's dig in.

166
00:07:39,469 --> 00:07:41,471
-Since I'm the eldest…
-Of course.

167
00:07:41,538 --> 00:07:43,873
-Have a drumstick.
-I only eat chicken legs.

168
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,041
Great, go for it.

169
00:07:46,743 --> 00:07:48,712
Everyone has their favorite parts.

170
00:07:48,778 --> 00:07:50,614
-I like everything.
-Oh, really?

171
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:53,516
-It's hot.
-Be careful.

172
00:07:54,117 --> 00:07:55,252
-It's hot.
-Be careful.

173
00:07:55,318 --> 00:07:57,087
TAKING A BITE

174
00:07:57,654 --> 00:07:58,688
Seriously…

175
00:07:59,256 --> 00:08:00,257
-Is it good?
-Yes.

176
00:08:00,323 --> 00:08:02,392
CHEF JUNWOO TAKES A BITE AS WELL

177
00:08:03,226 --> 00:08:04,694
DELIGHTED

178
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:07,831
I love this feeling before trying food.

179
00:08:07,898 --> 00:08:09,666
How tasty will this be?

180
00:08:09,733 --> 00:08:12,135
-Isn't the coating so tender?
-Yes.

181
00:08:12,202 --> 00:08:16,473
EAGERLY DEVOURING IT

182
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,542
DUJUN TRIES JUST THE CRISPY COATING

183
00:08:19,609 --> 00:08:21,678
Her cooking is always amazing.

184
00:08:22,245 --> 00:08:23,880
This is what I'm talking about.

185
00:08:23,947 --> 00:08:25,248
This is the stuff.

186
00:08:25,882 --> 00:08:27,951
I love this about classic fried chicken.

187
00:08:28,018 --> 00:08:31,688
Look at the empty spots here.

188
00:08:32,022 --> 00:08:34,324
And there's a crispy coating around it.

189
00:08:34,391 --> 00:08:35,759
-Right.
-This hits the spot.

190
00:08:35,825 --> 00:08:40,163
Nowadays, fried chicken
is fully coated all around.

191
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:46,069
MODERN FRIED CHICKEN
IS COMPLETELY COATED IN BATTER

192
00:08:47,304 --> 00:08:51,374
BUT THIS GO-TO SPOT'S CHICKEN
ISN'T EVENLY COATED

193
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:54,878
It's fun to eat just the crispy coating.

194
00:08:54,945 --> 00:08:58,515
-This is the good stuff.
-Exactly.

195
00:09:00,984 --> 00:09:03,687
It's on point,
just like a killer verse in rap music.

196
00:09:05,622 --> 00:09:09,526
I'M THE KILLER VERSE OF FRIED CHICKEN

197
00:09:09,593 --> 00:09:12,162
Wow, this is unbelievable.

198
00:09:12,229 --> 00:09:15,966
They thoroughly brine the chicken
before dipping it in the batter.

199
00:09:16,032 --> 00:09:17,267
That makes a difference.

200
00:09:17,334 --> 00:09:18,969
-Brining is a must.
-This is good.

201
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:20,904
-How is it?
-It's delicious.

202
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:24,040
The chicken has absorbed
the seasoning very well.

203
00:09:24,107 --> 00:09:25,542
<i>It's perfectly brined.</i>

204
00:09:25,609 --> 00:09:29,746
From what I remember, this kind of chicken
tends to get bland toward the end.

205
00:09:29,813 --> 00:09:30,847
I agree.

206
00:09:30,914 --> 00:09:34,417
After a while, I can't tell if I'm eating
whole chicken soup or fried chicken.

207
00:09:34,484 --> 00:09:39,022
I've heard that the owner brines
and deep-fries the chicken every day.

208
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:43,660
She goes to the market at 6:00 a.m.
and buys the chicken to brine it.

209
00:09:43,727 --> 00:09:47,964
I think it's this effort
that makes the food so good.

210
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:52,135
THE SUN RISES AT 6:00 A.M.

211
00:09:52,869 --> 00:09:56,006
SHE'S NEVER LATE TO OPEN THE RESTAURANT

212
00:09:56,907 --> 00:10:00,076
SHE STARTS THE DAY BY BLENDING
THE INGREDIENTS FOR THE BRINE

213
00:10:01,144 --> 00:10:05,181
SHE COVERS THE FRESH CHICKEN
WITH HER SECRET BRINE

214
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:11,721
SHE LETS IT REST
FOR TWO HOURS IN THE FRIDGE

215
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,160
SHE COATS IT THOROUGHLY
WITH CHICKEN POWDER MIX

216
00:10:20,864 --> 00:10:24,768
SHE MARINATES IT AGAIN IN THE FRIDGE

217
00:10:26,436 --> 00:10:33,043
LAYERED WITH RICH FLAVORS,
ABSORBED THROUGH TIME AND HARD WORK

218
00:10:33,877 --> 00:10:38,114
NAMNO TAKES A BITE OF THE CHICKEN WING

219
00:10:42,552 --> 00:10:44,921
TA-DA

220
00:10:46,223 --> 00:10:48,592
-It's fantastic.
-Dujun, wait a second.

221
00:10:48,658 --> 00:10:50,894
-You have to try this.
-What?

222
00:10:51,261 --> 00:10:54,497
-The chicken wing?
-Grab it like this…

223
00:10:54,564 --> 00:10:55,732
SHOWING HIM HOW TO EAT IT

224
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:58,835
-Eat the top and bottom, and take it out.
-Got it.

225
00:10:59,436 --> 00:11:02,272
Wow, the wings are insane.

226
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:03,840
DOES AS HE'S TOLD

227
00:11:05,609 --> 00:11:07,377
You can't help but make that sound.

228
00:11:08,044 --> 00:11:09,045
It's so tasty.

229
00:11:09,846 --> 00:11:12,482
-If this place were in front of my house…
-Me too.

230
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:16,086
…I would come here three times a week
to eat here or as takeout.

231
00:11:16,152 --> 00:11:17,387
-It's awesome.
-Perfect.

232
00:11:17,454 --> 00:11:19,522
-I'm craving beer.
-Me too.

233
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,393
I want to keep eating the coating.

234
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,629
Wasn't that part the best?

235
00:11:25,695 --> 00:11:28,632
DEVOURING BITE AFTER BITE

236
00:11:32,068 --> 00:11:33,436
This is perfect for summer.

237
00:11:34,237 --> 00:11:38,174
The refreshing beer
makes my throat tingle.

238
00:11:38,975 --> 00:11:42,479
BEER IS THE BEST WITH FRIED CHICKEN

239
00:11:42,546 --> 00:11:45,649
It looks like they make
the pickled radish themselves.

240
00:11:45,715 --> 00:11:48,084
-The pieces are different shapes.
-Yes, they are.

241
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:51,955
-I've heard that they make it themselves.
-That's amazing.

242
00:11:52,022 --> 00:11:55,659
-Ma'am, do you make this yourself?
-Yes, it's homemade.

243
00:11:56,693 --> 00:11:58,295
That's why the sizes vary.

244
00:11:59,563 --> 00:12:01,197
It's way better this way.

245
00:12:01,264 --> 00:12:03,833
THE HOMEMADE TOUCH MAKES IT EXTRA SPECIAL

246
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:08,004
The pickled radishes all taste the same
at other fried chicken places.

247
00:12:08,071 --> 00:12:09,873
<i>But this tastes different.</i>

248
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,175
<i>-It's so good.</i>
<i>-It's not mass-produced food.</i>

249
00:12:12,242 --> 00:12:13,743
EVEN THE PICKLED RADISH IS UNIQUE

250
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:17,847
But we eat so much fried chicken
that it's hard to be moved by it.

251
00:12:17,914 --> 00:12:20,517
If it's good,
we just say it's good and move on.

252
00:12:20,584 --> 00:12:22,319
But here, I get excited about it.

253
00:12:22,385 --> 00:12:25,689
IMPRESSED BY HOW MUCH HARD WORK
THEY PUT INTO THE FOOD HERE

254
00:12:25,755 --> 00:12:27,357
<i>I have a question for you.</i>

255
00:12:27,424 --> 00:12:29,359
-You used to be a journalist.
-Correct.

256
00:12:29,426 --> 00:12:31,861
What inspired you to become a chef?

257
00:12:31,928 --> 00:12:33,830
What got you into cooking?

258
00:12:33,897 --> 00:12:37,534
I used to be a journalist,
but not for long.

259
00:12:37,601 --> 00:12:42,706
It turned out to be different
from what I had imagined.

260
00:12:42,772 --> 00:12:45,909
I simply enjoyed cooking in my spare time.

261
00:12:45,976 --> 00:12:49,412
I found it fun
to invite guests and cook for them.

262
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:53,116
Meanwhile, it would take a whole day
to write an article.

263
00:12:53,183 --> 00:12:55,285
I'd only receive
mean comments or none at all,

264
00:12:55,352 --> 00:12:57,988
-but I'd get good feedback on food.
-That's hilarious.

265
00:12:58,054 --> 00:13:01,291
My work didn't feel rewarding,
so I contemplated what I should do.

266
00:13:01,358 --> 00:13:04,060
So, I thought I should learn to cook
while I'm still young.

267
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,128
-Where?
-Italy.

268
00:13:05,195 --> 00:13:09,165
-Wow, right away?
-Yes, I quit my job and went to Italy.

269
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,669
<i>Cooking wasn't an easy thing to learn.</i>

270
00:13:12,736 --> 00:13:16,373
And I couldn't really compete
with only a year or two of experience.

271
00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:17,607
After coming back here,

272
00:13:17,674 --> 00:13:21,545
I realized there are fun articles to write
from a chef's point of view.

273
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:24,548
So, now I write stories about food.

274
00:13:24,614 --> 00:13:27,951
This is how I became
a food columnist and chef.

275
00:13:28,018 --> 00:13:30,086
You use your past experience in your work.

276
00:13:30,153 --> 00:13:34,758
I like restaurants
that have a story behind their food.

277
00:13:34,824 --> 00:13:36,059
-Like Yeongi Bar?
-Exactly.

278
00:13:36,126 --> 00:13:38,762
This isn't just a long-standing place.

279
00:13:38,828 --> 00:13:40,530
There's always meaning behind that.

280
00:13:40,597 --> 00:13:43,233
I enjoy finding the meaning
behind those things,

281
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,968
so I write those stories.

282
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:48,838
Then how did you two become friends?

283
00:13:48,905 --> 00:13:51,441
Actually, I have a few journalist friends.

284
00:13:51,508 --> 00:13:55,312
They told me to go to Minseong
and learn to cook.

285
00:13:55,378 --> 00:13:58,215
-I see.
-He was like a legend to me.

286
00:13:58,281 --> 00:14:01,418
But when I was running a pop-up,
I needed some fish.

287
00:14:01,484 --> 00:14:03,320
So, I just contacted him,

288
00:14:03,386 --> 00:14:07,924
and he immediately told me
to come to Noryangjin.

289
00:14:08,658 --> 00:14:10,627
But Minseong is intimidating at first.

290
00:14:10,694 --> 00:14:12,896
Honestly, I thought
he was a yakuza at first.

291
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,465
-You punk.
-He's often misunderstood.

292
00:14:15,532 --> 00:14:16,866
People get the wrong idea.

293
00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:21,871
But now that I've known him for a long
time, he has a sort of youthful innocence.

294
00:14:21,938 --> 00:14:23,506
He has a big heart.

295
00:14:23,573 --> 00:14:25,542
If he didn't swear,
he'd be like Schweitzer.

296
00:14:26,376 --> 00:14:27,644
-That's his charm.
-Right.

297
00:14:27,711 --> 00:14:31,147
I feel like he swears a lot
to hide his pureheartedness.

298
00:14:31,815 --> 00:14:32,816
He's a gentle guy.

299
00:14:32,883 --> 00:14:36,987
IT TURNS OUT THAT MINSEONG IS A GENTLE GUY

300
00:14:37,821 --> 00:14:40,824
THE NEXT DISH WAS PREPARED
WHILE THEY CHATTED

301
00:14:40,891 --> 00:14:42,325
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

302
00:14:42,392 --> 00:14:44,628
Enjoy.

303
00:14:44,694 --> 00:14:47,664
-The seasoning has a glossy sheen.
-Yes.

304
00:14:47,731 --> 00:14:49,866
I make the seasoning myself.

305
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:51,635
-Really?
-Yes, she does it herself.

306
00:14:51,701 --> 00:14:53,670
It's all homemade.

307
00:14:53,737 --> 00:14:57,274
People mostly use pre-packaged
pickled radish and seasoning.

308
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,809
<i>The fact that she makes</i>
<i>everything from scratch…</i>

309
00:14:59,876 --> 00:15:01,678
<i>It's unique.</i>

310
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:06,783
PUT THE FRESHLY FRIED CHICKEN
IN A BIG BOWL

311
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:11,555
AND GENTLY POUR
THE HOMEMADE SEASONING ON TOP

312
00:15:14,658 --> 00:15:18,261
SPRINKLE SESAME SEEDS
FOR NUTTINESS AND PRESENTATION

313
00:15:19,663 --> 00:15:24,134
GLAZED <i>YANGNYEOM </i>FRIED CHICKEN IS READY

314
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:27,137
-Look at the coating.
-You need a fork for this.

315
00:15:27,203 --> 00:15:31,241
DUJUN STARTS EATING
THE SWEET COATING FIRST

316
00:15:34,177 --> 00:15:37,414
This spot is such a precious
and valuable place.

317
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,417
I'm grateful for this unique experience.

318
00:15:40,483 --> 00:15:42,586
MINSEONG TAKES A BITE
AND LICKS HIS FINGERS

319
00:15:44,321 --> 00:15:47,123
NAMNO ALSO TAKES A HUGE BITE

320
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,663
-The seasoning is different.
-It's mild.

321
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,131
Not too much corn syrup.

322
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:59,135
<i>Yangnyeom </i>chicken is
usually too sweet or strong.

323
00:15:59,803 --> 00:16:02,572
-But this is just right.
-It's nice and spicy.

324
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,811
There's a clear difference between
store-bought sauce and homemade sauce.

325
00:16:07,878 --> 00:16:09,045
This sure is homemade.

326
00:16:09,112 --> 00:16:12,282
-But it's so delicious.
-Exactly.

327
00:16:12,349 --> 00:16:14,451
You usually get fed up with eating this,

328
00:16:14,517 --> 00:16:16,653
so you tend to eat one or two pieces.

329
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,256
<i>But this seasoning makes it hard</i>
<i>to stop eating.</i>

330
00:16:19,322 --> 00:16:20,590
<i>I love that about this.</i>

331
00:16:20,657 --> 00:16:22,459
THIS FLAVOR NEVER GETS OLD

332
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:25,395
-How is it, Minseong?
-Leave me alone.

333
00:16:29,232 --> 00:16:31,768
Would you order the regular
or the <i>yangnyeom</i>?

334
00:16:31,835 --> 00:16:35,572
What I like about the regular one is
that you can taste the natural flavor.

335
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:39,476
<i>I think the salt seasoning</i>
<i>boosts the flavor.</i>

336
00:16:41,044 --> 00:16:45,415
<i>And I love the unique homemade seasoning</i>
<i>of the </i>yangnyeom <i>version.</i>

337
00:16:45,482 --> 00:16:49,185
-I'm curious about the curry one.
-Me too.

338
00:16:50,287 --> 00:16:54,791
JUST IN TIME,
SHE STARTS FRYING IN THE KITCHEN

339
00:16:56,192 --> 00:16:59,429
Wow, isn't this sound so beautiful?

340
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,169
THE THIRD CHICKEN IS QUICKLY DEEP-FRIED

341
00:17:09,906 --> 00:17:12,175
-I've never tried the curry one.
-Here it comes.

342
00:17:12,242 --> 00:17:13,276
Look at that.

343
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,681
It smells insane.

344
00:17:17,747 --> 00:17:18,982
CURRY FRIED CHICKEN

345
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:21,618
She sprinkles curry powder on the outside.

346
00:17:21,685 --> 00:17:24,654
Yes, she sprinkled it
on the fried chicken.

347
00:17:24,721 --> 00:17:27,524
-I just know this will be delicious.
-I agree.

348
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:30,160
IT'S GUARANTEED TO BE AMAZING

349
00:17:34,064 --> 00:17:36,366
-Good? I'm so excited.
-Yes.

350
00:17:36,433 --> 00:17:38,168
The coating is scrumptious.

351
00:17:38,235 --> 00:17:42,606
EVERYONE IS COMPLETELY LOST
IN THE CURRY FRIED CHICKEN

352
00:17:43,974 --> 00:17:48,278
TAKING A BITE

353
00:17:50,714 --> 00:17:53,550
What made you come up
with this curry fried chicken?

354
00:17:53,617 --> 00:17:54,818
Was it always on the menu?

355
00:17:54,885 --> 00:17:56,052
No, it wasn't.

356
00:17:56,119 --> 00:18:00,690
This is usually made
by adding curry powder to the batter.

357
00:18:00,757 --> 00:18:03,159
But you just sprinkle
the curry powder on top.

358
00:18:03,226 --> 00:18:06,496
This was the only way
to keep it from becoming watery.

359
00:18:06,563 --> 00:18:10,767
Sprinkling the powder
on the chicken tasted the best.

360
00:18:11,668 --> 00:18:13,970
SPRINKLE PLENTY OF CURRY POWDER
OVER THE CHICKEN

361
00:18:14,571 --> 00:18:17,908
TOP WITH PARSLEY AS WELL

362
00:18:18,675 --> 00:18:21,111
GOLDEN BROWN CURRY FRIED CHICKEN IS READY

363
00:18:22,178 --> 00:18:26,149
THE YELLOW COLOR MAKES YOUR MOUTH WATER

364
00:18:26,216 --> 00:18:29,152
Adding curry powder
makes a huge difference.

365
00:18:33,123 --> 00:18:35,525
If you want to spice it up a bit,

366
00:18:35,592 --> 00:18:37,494
<i>dip it in the </i>yangnyeom <i>chicken sauce.</i>

367
00:18:37,561 --> 00:18:38,762
<i>Yes, it's way better.</i>

368
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:45,936
NAMNO TRIES IT RIGHT AWAY

369
00:18:46,002 --> 00:18:49,839
Dipping the curry fried chicken
in the <i>yangnyeom </i>sauce is a delicacy.

370
00:18:49,906 --> 00:18:52,242
-It's a blend of the two.
-Exactly.

371
00:18:54,177 --> 00:18:58,281
NAMNO CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT

372
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:05,455
HE DOESN'T STOP DEVOURING
WHILE THE OTHERS ARE CHATTING

373
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,391
HE EATS

374
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:10,594
AND EATS

375
00:19:11,194 --> 00:19:14,965
AND EATS SOME MORE

376
00:19:15,565 --> 00:19:18,602
IT SEEMS LIKE HE'S BRUSHING HIS TEETH

377
00:19:19,369 --> 00:19:22,172
SATISFIED

378
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,976
Namno is really killing it today.

379
00:19:26,042 --> 00:19:28,211
-Seriously, it's so delicious.
-Namno.

380
00:19:28,278 --> 00:19:30,113
If you stop talking, it means it's good.

381
00:19:30,981 --> 00:19:33,250
-Look at him.
-Wow, he eats so well.

382
00:19:33,316 --> 00:19:34,384
Namno is an insane eater.

383
00:19:34,451 --> 00:19:35,485
PROUD, AMAZED

384
00:19:37,587 --> 00:19:39,890
-Come here. Your nose is sweaty.
-I mean…

385
00:19:39,956 --> 00:19:41,458
Gosh, wipe it off.

386
00:19:42,459 --> 00:19:44,561
I've never seen him like this on the show.

387
00:19:44,628 --> 00:19:46,129
Really? I'm glad to hear that.

388
00:19:46,763 --> 00:19:51,301
You don't usually have
high expectations for fried chicken.

389
00:19:51,368 --> 00:19:52,969
But it hits different here.

390
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:57,374
The fried chicken here is
on a different level than other places.

391
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,441
I agree.

392
00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:03,246
It looks like Chef Namno is still hungry,
so let's order some more.

393
00:20:03,313 --> 00:20:05,448
Can we get one regular and one <i>yangnyeom?</i>

394
00:20:05,515 --> 00:20:07,517
-Sure.
-Namno keeps eating if it's tasty.

395
00:20:08,385 --> 00:20:12,122
-Chef, you also write food columns.
-That's right.

396
00:20:12,188 --> 00:20:15,091
Do you perhaps know
about the history of fried chicken?

397
00:20:15,158 --> 00:20:18,228
There's a place in Korea
that first started making roasted chicken.

398
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:20,964
-Where?
-It's Yeongyang Center in Myeongdong.

399
00:20:21,031 --> 00:20:22,499
-Have you heard of it?
-Yes.

400
00:20:22,566 --> 00:20:24,467
<i>It opened in the 1960s.</i>

401
00:20:24,534 --> 00:20:27,404
<i>They sold rotisserie chicken,</i>
<i>not fried chicken.</i>

402
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:31,641
In 1977, L*m's Ch*cken was the first place
to make the fried chicken we know.

403
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,578
<i>It was the first</i>
<i>fried chicken franchise in the country.</i>

404
00:20:34,644 --> 00:20:35,712
YEONGI BAR

405
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:38,215
<i>Yeongi Bar opened three years later.</i>

406
00:20:39,082 --> 00:20:42,118
I can't believe this place
has been here for this long.

407
00:20:42,185 --> 00:20:46,456
The reason there are
so many fried chicken places is

408
00:20:46,523 --> 00:20:49,025
-because of the 2002 World Cup.
-In 2002.

409
00:20:49,693 --> 00:20:51,194
The <i>chimaek </i>culture began then.

410
00:20:51,261 --> 00:20:52,862
-Really?
-Yes.

411
00:20:53,463 --> 00:20:55,532
<i>It was imprinted on the whole nation.</i>

412
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:57,667
IT HAS BECOME A PART OF OUR FOOD CULTURE

413
00:20:57,734 --> 00:21:00,070
It's 365 chickens in a year…

414
00:21:00,136 --> 00:21:02,505
HERE COMES THE FRESHLY
ORDERED FRIED CHICKEN

415
00:21:05,508 --> 00:21:08,278
Please make us a food pairing
with this fried chicken.

416
00:21:08,345 --> 00:21:10,814
Namno and Minseong
will be the ones to do it.

417
00:21:10,881 --> 00:21:13,083
-Let's go.
-Ways to enjoy this dish more.

418
00:21:13,149 --> 00:21:14,951
-We always do this.
-I see.

419
00:21:15,018 --> 00:21:17,520
-What will be the penalty?
-Let me see…

420
00:21:18,221 --> 00:21:19,890
This place is special.

421
00:21:19,956 --> 00:21:23,026
-It can only last if sales are high.
-Yes, I hope it stays open.

422
00:21:23,093 --> 00:21:26,930
How about the loser pays
for ten fried chickens in advance?

423
00:21:27,597 --> 00:21:28,598
What do you think?

424
00:21:28,665 --> 00:21:30,433
-I'm in!
-Gosh, you scared me.

425
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,969
Okay, it sounds fun.
We can even promote our show.

426
00:21:33,336 --> 00:21:34,738
I prepared in advance.

427
00:21:34,804 --> 00:21:38,408
-I'll only be using one item.
-What is it?

428
00:21:38,475 --> 00:21:40,377
He usually mixes various ingredients.

429
00:21:40,443 --> 00:21:43,547
-But you'll be going simple?
-Since the food itself is perfect.

430
00:21:45,482 --> 00:21:47,250
Can I have the item I left in here?

431
00:21:49,853 --> 00:21:52,622
WHAT DID NAMNO BRING?

432
00:21:52,689 --> 00:21:54,658
-I brought…
-What's that?

433
00:21:54,724 --> 00:21:57,527
IS IT BEER?

434
00:22:01,698 --> 00:22:03,033
He's getting us drunk first.

435
00:22:03,099 --> 00:22:05,969
IS THIS HIS STRATEGY?

436
00:22:07,804 --> 00:22:09,940
There's something in your pocket.

437
00:22:11,074 --> 00:22:13,043
-It's this.
-What is that?

438
00:22:13,677 --> 00:22:14,678
It's this.

439
00:22:14,744 --> 00:22:16,346
WHAT IS IT?

440
00:22:18,114 --> 00:22:19,583
-Oh, it's lime.
-Yes.

441
00:22:19,649 --> 00:22:21,218
-Oh, it's lime juice.
-I see.

442
00:22:21,885 --> 00:22:24,421
NAMNO'S ITEM IS LIME JUICE

443
00:22:24,487 --> 00:22:27,591
-Do you know C*rona beer?
-Yes.

444
00:22:28,225 --> 00:22:31,194
-You add lemon…
-Were you inspired by that?

445
00:22:31,261 --> 00:22:33,063
Yes, you stick lime in the beer.

446
00:22:33,129 --> 00:22:34,764
Actually, lime soju is also good.

447
00:22:35,465 --> 00:22:36,499
It tastes sour.

448
00:22:36,566 --> 00:22:37,567
SQUEEZES LEMON JUICE INTO THE BEER

449
00:22:37,634 --> 00:22:38,735
And…

450
00:22:38,802 --> 00:22:39,869
My mouth is watering.

451
00:22:42,205 --> 00:22:43,840
-I should try the beer first.
-Yes.

452
00:22:43,907 --> 00:22:45,242
A GLASS OF LIME JUICE BEER

453
00:22:46,543 --> 00:22:48,044
Take a drink of this.

454
00:22:52,949 --> 00:22:53,950
Isn't it nice?

455
00:22:54,517 --> 00:22:55,819
Yes, it's great.

456
00:22:59,756 --> 00:23:02,592
It tastes like lemon beer
that isn't too sweet.

457
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:03,660
And…

458
00:23:04,394 --> 00:23:05,762
IT'S NOT OVER

459
00:23:05,829 --> 00:23:08,231
-Take this…
-That's the best part.

460
00:23:09,699 --> 00:23:14,671
SECOND FOOD PAIRING: CHICKEN AND SALT

461
00:23:14,738 --> 00:23:15,772
This is it.

462
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:18,742
AND LIME JUICE

463
00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:20,410
Why don't you…

464
00:23:20,777 --> 00:23:22,546
-Is this it?
-Yes.

465
00:23:23,313 --> 00:23:24,314
The ultimate bite.

466
00:23:24,948 --> 00:23:27,450
But he looks kind of disappointed.

467
00:23:28,318 --> 00:23:30,554
It needs to be easy.

468
00:23:31,154 --> 00:23:33,123
I could've used all the ingredients.

469
00:23:33,456 --> 00:23:35,325
IT'S BETTER THAN EXPECTED

470
00:23:35,392 --> 00:23:36,493
Yes, it's yummy.

471
00:23:37,294 --> 00:23:40,630
The lime juice balances out
the greasiness.

472
00:23:40,697 --> 00:23:42,766
-This is new.
-Right.

473
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:46,503
You're really… good at this.

474
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:49,839
-I've never thought of adding lime juice.
-Really?

475
00:23:49,906 --> 00:23:53,209
Maybe it's because he's young
and open-minded.

476
00:23:53,276 --> 00:23:55,078
Minseong, show us your food pairing.

477
00:23:55,612 --> 00:23:56,813
Let me visit the kitchen.

478
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,248
MINSEONG ENTERS THE KITCHEN

479
00:23:58,315 --> 00:23:59,382
I'll be right back.

480
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,117
He's hiding something.

481
00:24:01,518 --> 00:24:03,286
He won't bring sashimi out, right?

482
00:24:04,688 --> 00:24:07,257
-Sashimi chicken.
-It might go well with this.

483
00:24:08,425 --> 00:24:09,793
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

484
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:12,262
HE TAKES SOMETHING OUT IN THE KITCHEN

485
00:24:13,096 --> 00:24:15,665
CHOPPING

486
00:24:15,732 --> 00:24:19,502
-Wait, what is he…
-Are you cooking?

487
00:24:20,704 --> 00:24:22,205
He's mincing onion.

488
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,907
MINSEONG MINCES ONION

489
00:24:24,908 --> 00:24:27,377
You shouldn't chop things
in someone else's kitchen.

490
00:24:28,111 --> 00:24:29,379
Wow, he's going this far?

491
00:24:29,446 --> 00:24:31,748
DID NOT EXPECT HIM TO DO THIS

492
00:24:32,515 --> 00:24:35,986
ADDS THE <i>YANGNYEOM </i>CHICKEN SAUCE
TO THE MINCED ONION

493
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,257
SUPER FOCUSED WHILE MIXING

494
00:24:40,323 --> 00:24:42,859
-It's here.
-Wow, what's all this?

495
00:24:42,926 --> 00:24:46,129
HIS FOOD PAIRING ITEM IS FINALLY READY

496
00:24:46,196 --> 00:24:47,297
He whipped this up.

497
00:24:47,364 --> 00:24:49,699
It's nothing. I just minced an onion.

498
00:24:49,766 --> 00:24:52,903
<i>Then I added a bit of the sauce</i>
<i>from the </i>yangnyeom <i>chicken.</i>

499
00:24:53,603 --> 00:24:56,539
Add it to the chicken breast.

500
00:24:57,707 --> 00:25:00,577
-Add plenty to the chicken legs.
-Of course.

501
00:25:00,644 --> 00:25:02,345
It's kind of like salsa.

502
00:25:02,412 --> 00:25:04,581
-You're right.
-Exactly.

503
00:25:06,182 --> 00:25:08,418
It isn't too strong.

504
00:25:08,485 --> 00:25:11,221
JUNWOO CAREFULLY TAKES A BITE

505
00:25:11,955 --> 00:25:15,759
I thought this combination was quite good.

506
00:25:15,825 --> 00:25:17,694
AN APPROVING TASTE THAT MAKES HIM NOD

507
00:25:17,761 --> 00:25:20,463
-I made this with a few ingredients.
-This is awesome.

508
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,098
It tastes completely new…
Not familiar…

00:25:22,165 --> 00:25:23,199
JUNWOO GRABS THE JUICE

510
00:25:23,266 --> 00:25:24,668
Don't you crave this?

511
00:25:24,734 --> 00:25:26,870
It might taste better
with some lime juice.

512
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,239
-Then…
-Why don't we add some?

513
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,741
It needs some tanginess.

514
00:25:31,808 --> 00:25:33,643
There is no right answer.

515
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:36,446
You need to add ingredients
to make it better.

516
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,916
Chefs have so much fun
when making new things.

517
00:25:40,483 --> 00:25:42,085
I want to try this.

518
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,988
It looks delicious.

519
00:25:45,055 --> 00:25:47,757
TAKES A BIG BITE OF THE NEW FOOD PAIRING

520
00:25:49,926 --> 00:25:51,361
SATISFIED

521
00:25:51,428 --> 00:25:57,234
Since you're a food columnist,
why don't you give us a one-line review?

522
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,469
-Chef Namno's chicken and lime.
-Yes.

523
00:26:00,103 --> 00:26:02,172
-Chicken and lime.
-That sounds good.

524
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:03,473
He named the dish.

525
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,675
<i>This is my quick review of the dish.</i>

526
00:26:06,309 --> 00:26:09,813
<i>It feels like an awkward first kiss</i>
<i>between the fried chicken and lime.</i>

527
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,250
FRIED CHICKEN AND LIME'S
AWKWARD FIRST KISS

528
00:26:13,316 --> 00:26:16,253
-It's kind of…
-Stop it.

529
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:19,956
-I've never eaten them together.
-It's our first time.

530
00:26:20,023 --> 00:26:24,261
I've never had chicken with lime.
It was a bit unfamiliar.

531
00:26:24,327 --> 00:26:26,730
-It was intense.
-But it paired well.

532
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,331
That's my review.

533
00:26:28,398 --> 00:26:30,000
-I fully understand that.
-Me too.

534
00:26:30,066 --> 00:26:33,270
And let me comment
on Chef Minseong's onion fried chicken.

535
00:26:33,336 --> 00:26:34,804
-Onion fried chicken.
-This is…

536
00:26:36,406 --> 00:26:38,408
<i>guaranteed to be a delicious pairing.</i>

537
00:26:41,111 --> 00:26:43,680
<i>The combination had a delicate flavor,</i>

538
00:26:43,747 --> 00:26:46,850
<i>just like his youthful</i>
<i>and innocent personality.</i>

539
00:26:48,351 --> 00:26:49,386
Personally,

540
00:26:49,452 --> 00:26:51,621
"THE WINNER IS"

541
00:26:51,688 --> 00:26:53,723
I liked Minseong's pairing more.

542
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,859
THE WINNER IS CHEF MINSEONG

543
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:58,228
I have to pay for ten fried chickens.

544
00:26:59,429 --> 00:27:01,331
I won't be clapping.

545
00:27:01,398 --> 00:27:04,968
I think franchises should add this
to their fried chicken.

546
00:27:05,035 --> 00:27:08,572
-It's insane.
-Onion <i>yangnyeom </i>chicken.

547
00:27:08,638 --> 00:27:10,640
-Add a bit of garlic.
-Exactly.

548
00:27:10,707 --> 00:27:13,310
And a touch of tanginess to this.

549
00:27:13,376 --> 00:27:16,146
If you want to improve it,
mix in some more ingredients.

550
00:27:16,213 --> 00:27:18,615
But this was the best
I could do this quickly.

551
00:27:18,682 --> 00:27:22,953
It's such a joy watching you two
create this dish together.

552
00:27:23,019 --> 00:27:24,821
<i>Wow, you're both fantastic.</i>

553
00:27:24,888 --> 00:27:27,424
THEY UPGRADED THE DISH TOGETHER
WITH CLEVER COMBINATIONS

554
00:27:28,191 --> 00:27:30,660
THEY ENJOYED EATING TOGETHER
AND DISCOVERED NEW FLAVORS

555
00:27:30,727 --> 00:27:32,662
<i>This was very new to me.</i>

556
00:27:33,296 --> 00:27:36,066
I thought I was familiar
with fried chicken.

557
00:27:36,733 --> 00:27:41,538
But I learned something new
while spending time here.

558
00:27:42,205 --> 00:27:44,107
It's like a whole new world opened up.

559
00:27:44,174 --> 00:27:47,744
Koreans believe we've tasted it all,
but there's a lot more to try.

560
00:27:47,811 --> 00:27:48,879
-Of course.
-Yes.

561
00:27:48,945 --> 00:27:51,748
The restaurant industry
in our country is well-developed,

562
00:27:53,116 --> 00:27:55,185
but the menu is not very diverse.

563
00:27:55,252 --> 00:27:56,586
Everything is standardized.

564
00:27:56,653 --> 00:28:00,790
It's precious and valuable
that this place is still in business.

565
00:28:00,857 --> 00:28:03,894
Come to this restaurant
and try the dishes here.

566
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,196
Your go-to spots are
where you like the food,

567
00:28:06,263 --> 00:28:08,732
-not because someone recommended it.
-Right.

568
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:12,669
-It's fun to explore new flavors.
-I agree.

569
00:28:15,705 --> 00:28:19,809
IN A WORLD WHERE EVERYTHING SEEMS SIMILAR

570
00:28:21,144 --> 00:28:26,950
THIS SPOT WORKS HARD
TO MAKE A SPECIAL DISH

571
00:28:27,918 --> 00:28:31,855
THIS PRECIOUS MOMENT CAN
ONLY BE EXPERIENCED HERE

572
00:28:31,922 --> 00:28:34,424

573
00:28:34,491 --> 00:28:36,359

576

-Thank you for the food.
-You're welcome.

577
00:28:44,367 --> 00:28:45,902
Do this for the next 20 years.

578
00:28:45,969 --> 00:28:48,605
HOPES TO VISIT THIS PLACE FOR A LONG TIME

579
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,148
Thanks to Namno, our viewers…

580
00:28:58,215 --> 00:29:01,218
I'll pay for ten fried chickens
in advance.

581
00:29:01,551 --> 00:29:06,690
Ma'am, please serve one fried chicken
to each new customer.

582
00:29:06,756 --> 00:29:09,192
-Got it, thanks.
-Thank you for the food, as always.

583
00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:11,561
It's my first time here.
Thank you for the food.

584
00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:15,565
SIGNING THE POSTER THEY WILL LEAVE BEHIND

585
00:29:15,632 --> 00:29:19,569
MINSEONG AND DUJUN ALSO SIGN IT

586
00:29:19,636 --> 00:29:22,105
-Junwoo, why don't you sign it as well?
-Sure.

587
00:29:22,172 --> 00:29:23,173
Press down hard…

588
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,941
CHEF JUNWOO ALSO SIGNS IT

589
00:29:25,008 --> 00:29:26,343
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

590
00:29:26,409 --> 00:29:28,511
