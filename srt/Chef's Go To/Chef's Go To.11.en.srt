00:00:01,912 --> 00:00:04,114
GIL-DONG, GANGDONG-GU, SEOUL

2
00:00:05,515 --> 00:00:08,451
WHICH FOODIE BROTHERS CAME
TO GIL-DONG TODAY?

3
00:00:08,985 --> 00:00:10,453
THE FOURTH, YOON DUJUN

4
00:00:10,987 --> 00:00:12,455
THE THIRD, LIM TAEHOON

5
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,558
THE SECOND, DAVID LEE

6
00:00:14,624 --> 00:00:19,396
We came to this area
because it's packed with good restaurants.

7
00:00:19,462 --> 00:00:23,533
It's been a while since I've come to
a neighborhood with so many restaurants.

8
00:00:24,768 --> 00:00:28,905
LINED WITH RESTAURANTS
SERVING VARIOUS KINDS OF FOOD

9
00:00:28,972 --> 00:00:31,875
Who invited today's chef?

10
00:00:31,942 --> 00:00:32,976
-Not me.
-I did.

11
00:00:33,043 --> 00:00:35,312
-Oh, Taehoon did.
-That's right.

12
00:00:35,378 --> 00:00:42,319
The chef I invited today is
the first foreigner on this show.

13
00:00:42,385 --> 00:00:43,486
Is that so?

14
00:00:43,954 --> 00:00:45,722
-Really?
-Yes, he is a foreign chef.

15
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:46,890
THE FIRST FOREIGN CHEF?

16
00:00:46,957 --> 00:00:48,024
Who is it?

17
00:00:50,527 --> 00:00:52,729
TALL

18
00:00:53,597 --> 00:00:55,465
<i>Buongiorno</i>, my friend.

19
00:00:55,532 --> 00:00:57,300
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

20
00:00:57,367 --> 00:00:59,236
-He's here.
-He sure is.

21
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,138
I brought drinks.

22
00:01:02,205 --> 00:01:03,907
He's turned into a complete Korean.

23
00:01:04,174 --> 00:01:06,910
How could an Italian bring Americanos?

24
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:09,946
-He's totally Korean.
-Exactly.

25
00:01:10,013 --> 00:01:11,748
Not Korean, I'm Kotalian.

26
00:01:11,815 --> 00:01:14,184
-You're Kotalian.
-That's right.

27
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,421
COOKS CLASSIC ITALIAN DISHES

28
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:25,428
Fabri-style ragù pasta.

29
00:01:26,396 --> 00:01:30,934
AN ITALIAN CHEF
WHO IS ALSO PASSIONATE ABOUT COFFEE

30
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:34,771
I already drank three cups of this.

31
00:01:34,838 --> 00:01:35,839
FABRIZIO FERRARI

32
00:01:35,906 --> 00:01:36,907
I'm addicted.

33
00:01:37,474 --> 00:01:39,776
-Do you like iced Americano?
-Yes, I love it.

34
00:01:39,843 --> 00:01:41,845
-Seriously?
-He's not Italian anymore.

35
00:01:41,912 --> 00:01:43,914
I'm an original Kotalian.

36
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,284
-I'm the original.
-Got it.

37
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,786
Do you come to Gil-dong often?

38
00:01:50,387 --> 00:01:51,988
-Yes, I do.
-Really?

39
00:01:52,055 --> 00:01:55,258
Of course, I have a go-to place here.

40
00:01:55,325 --> 00:01:57,561
-I see.
-But it's a secret.

41
00:01:57,627 --> 00:02:00,297
I'm curious. Is it an Italian restaurant?

42
00:02:00,697 --> 00:02:03,934
-Even Taehoon doesn't know this spot.
-Really?

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,402
Wow, I'm curious.

44
00:02:05,468 --> 00:02:06,536
Let's get going.

45
00:02:07,304 --> 00:02:08,338
Off we go.

46
00:02:08,405 --> 00:02:09,806
HERE WE GO

47
00:02:10,974 --> 00:02:14,678
OF ALL THESE RESTAURANTS, WHICH ONE IS IT?

48
00:02:14,978 --> 00:02:16,913
Take a guess.

49
00:02:18,148 --> 00:02:21,885
Maybe it's an authentic Italian restaurant
that Chef Fabri likes.

50
00:02:21,952 --> 00:02:24,221
No, it doesn't serve Italian dishes.

51
00:02:24,287 --> 00:02:27,290
Isn't Gil-dong udon famous here?

52
00:02:27,357 --> 00:02:32,128
-It's beyond anything you can imagine.
-I see.

53
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:34,364
-Beyond anything?
-Exactly.

54
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:39,202
<i>Maybe it's a classic Korean dish</i>
<i>that Kotalians like.</i>

55
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:41,571
<i>-I'll give you a hint.</i>
<i>-Sure.</i>

56
00:02:42,305 --> 00:02:46,309
I drank too much alcohol last night.

57
00:02:46,843 --> 00:02:48,845
A DISH RELATED TO ALCOHOL

58
00:02:48,912 --> 00:02:51,581
You eat it after drinking.
It's that place.

59
00:02:52,115 --> 00:02:55,518
Read it out loud, please.

60
00:02:55,585 --> 00:02:58,288
-"Hangover soup."
-"Hangover soup."

61
00:02:58,355 --> 00:02:59,356
-There.
-Yeonghwajeong?

62
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:03,827
A HANGOVER SOUP PLACE WITH AN OLD SIGN

63
00:03:03,894 --> 00:03:07,097
It's a hangover soup spot that
you confidently recommend to Koreans.

64
00:03:07,163 --> 00:03:09,199
I can't imagine you
enjoying hangover soup.

65
00:03:09,266 --> 00:03:10,533
Absolutely not.

66
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,769
-Let's go in.
-Let's head inside.

67
00:03:12,836 --> 00:03:15,572
-Chef, after you.
-Sure.

68
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,210
Hello, sir.

69
00:03:20,277 --> 00:03:22,512
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

70
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:24,848
-Hello.
-He seems charismatic.

71
00:03:24,915 --> 00:03:26,750
-Hi.
-This sure is a good restaurant.

72
00:03:26,816 --> 00:03:28,952
JUNG SANGJIN
RUNS THE <i>SEONJI </i>HANGOVER SOUP SPOT

73
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:30,220
-Please sit here.
-Okay.

74
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,090
-What do you think of this place?
-I love the vibes here.

75
00:03:34,157 --> 00:03:36,226
-Isn't it like an old-school eatery?
-Yes.

76
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,030
It's easy to order
since there's only one menu item.

77
00:03:40,096 --> 00:03:41,865
There's only one dish on the menu.

78
00:03:41,932 --> 00:03:43,533
<i>-Seonji </i>hangover soup.
-Exactly.

79
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,101
It's 9,000 won.

80
00:03:45,168 --> 00:03:47,070
9,000 WON

81
00:03:47,137 --> 00:03:50,674
<i>Jjajangmyeon </i>costs around 8,000
to 9,000 won on average.

82
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,142
Wow, it went up a lot.

83
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,411
It's about 11,000 won
if you go to a fancy place.

84
00:03:54,477 --> 00:03:58,281
But 9,000 won for hangover soup
is unbelievably cheap.

85
00:03:58,348 --> 00:04:01,451
Interesting. You can only order it
for dine-in until 2:30 p.m.

86
00:04:01,518 --> 00:04:03,286
and takeout until 3:00 p.m.

87
00:04:03,353 --> 00:04:05,422
-Really?
-Then what about after 3:00 p.m.?

88
00:04:05,488 --> 00:04:10,093
After 3:00 p.m.,
we have to start prep for tomorrow.

89
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,298
The fact that you prepare it every day
means that the ingredients are…

90
00:04:15,365 --> 00:04:17,267
-Fresh.
-Right.

91
00:04:17,334 --> 00:04:18,902
We also make kimchi every day.

92
00:04:18,969 --> 00:04:20,237
Wow, that's amazing.

93
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:21,938
FOOD MADE WITH FRESH INGREDIENTS

94
00:04:22,606 --> 00:04:27,878
HE ONLY SELLS <i>SEONJI </i>HANGOVER SOUP
DURING LIMITED OPENING HOURS

95
00:04:27,944 --> 00:04:30,881
So, shall we first order
four servings of the soup?

96
00:04:30,947 --> 00:04:34,217
-We'll have four of that, please.
-Got it.

97
00:04:34,284 --> 00:04:36,486
<i>-You're an Italian chef.</i>
<i>-That's right.</i>

98
00:04:36,553 --> 00:04:39,689
<i>How did this hangover soup place</i>
<i>become your go-to spot?</i>

99
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:46,329
I was always curious about hangover food
because we don't have that in Italy.

100
00:04:46,396 --> 00:04:48,098
We don't have that culture there.

101
00:04:48,164 --> 00:04:49,699
What if you have a hangover?

102
00:04:49,766 --> 00:04:52,135
We just drink coffee for hangovers.

103
00:04:52,202 --> 00:04:55,739
-I see.
-We drink very strong espresso.

104
00:04:55,805 --> 00:04:58,541
That's all we have, so…

105
00:04:58,608 --> 00:05:00,610
I was surprised when I came here

106
00:05:01,144 --> 00:05:03,980
and found out there's a hangover culture.

107
00:05:04,047 --> 00:05:07,117
So, when I tried hangover soup
for the first time,

108
00:05:07,183 --> 00:05:09,419
I felt much better.

109
00:05:09,486 --> 00:05:12,789
It was so effective. It was incredible.

110
00:05:12,856 --> 00:05:17,160
So, if I drink too much these days…

111
00:05:17,227 --> 00:05:18,895
If I get wasted…

112
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:23,667
If I drink too much soju, I come here.

113
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:26,403
I come here right away.
That's why it's my go-to spot.

114
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:28,638
Now I get it.

115
00:05:28,705 --> 00:05:30,407
-It's here.
-Yes.

116
00:05:30,473 --> 00:05:32,776
Oh, never mind. They are side dishes.

117
00:05:34,644 --> 00:05:37,214
CLASSIC SOUP SIDE DISHES:
TWO TYPES OF KIMCHI

118
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:39,950
SPICY NAPA CABBAGE KIMCHI

119
00:05:40,717 --> 00:05:43,053
REFRESHING DICED RADISH KIMCHI

120
00:05:43,119 --> 00:05:44,788
Wait, they have twisted peppers.

121
00:05:45,322 --> 00:05:47,023
You're right. That's cool.

122
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:54,497
The stir-fried twisted peppers
and anchovies are a unique side dish here.

123
00:05:54,564 --> 00:05:57,934
These three dishes look good together.

124
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:00,103
He looks so happy.

125
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:04,507
They all go well
with <i>seonji </i>hangover soup.

126
00:06:04,574 --> 00:06:05,675
I love them.

127
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:09,880
SUPER MOUTHWATERING

128
00:06:09,946 --> 00:06:11,648
-I can't wait to try them.
-Me too.

129
00:06:11,715 --> 00:06:13,550
I'll try the twisted peppers first.

130
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:16,419
This is the stuff.

131
00:06:16,486 --> 00:06:18,655
-These are anchovies.
-Yes, I know.

132
00:06:18,722 --> 00:06:19,723
TAKES A BITE

133
00:06:22,626 --> 00:06:24,494
WHAT DOES IT TASTE LIKE?

134
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:26,596
-It's tasty.
-It's perfectly seasoned.

135
00:06:27,464 --> 00:06:28,965
-Let me have some.
-It's yummy.

136
00:06:29,766 --> 00:06:32,035
-Oh, but it's spicy.
-It sure is.

137
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,438
<i>It's not an ordinary side dish.</i>

138
00:06:35,505 --> 00:06:39,109
THE STIR-FRIED TWISTED PEPPERS
AND ANCHOVIES ARE SEASONED WELL

139
00:06:39,743 --> 00:06:42,946
-It's scrumptious.
-Try the kimchi, too.

140
00:06:44,681 --> 00:06:47,851
TAKING A BITE OF NICELY FERMENTED
NAPA CABBAGE KIMCHI

141
00:06:49,686 --> 00:06:50,687
It's unbelievable.

142
00:06:51,154 --> 00:06:53,023
<i>They used good chili powder.</i>

143
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:55,592
<i>And ginger adds the kick here.</i>

144
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:57,494
<i>-The ginger aroma is strong.</i>
<i>-It's tasty.</i>

145
00:06:57,561 --> 00:07:03,500
-That also helps with hangovers.
-Absolutely.

146
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:04,734
GINGER SOOTHES HANGOVERS

147
00:07:04,801 --> 00:07:08,038
It's homemade kimchi.

148
00:07:08,672 --> 00:07:10,907
BEFORE AND AFTER OPENING
THE RESTAURANT EVERY DAY,

149
00:07:11,508 --> 00:07:13,843
HE STARTS BY PREPPING ALL THE INGREDIENTS

150
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:16,680
HE MAKES NAPA CABBAGE KIMCHI,
DICED RADISH KIMCHI

151
00:07:17,314 --> 00:07:19,950
AND OTHER SIDE DISHES AS WELL

152
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,519
EVERYTHING IS MADE FRESH

153
00:07:22,586 --> 00:07:25,288
THE OWNER MAKES JUST ENOUGH FOR THE DAY

154
00:07:25,922 --> 00:07:28,124
THE SAME GOES FOR THE <i>SEONJI </i>HANGOVER SOUP

155
00:07:29,025 --> 00:07:32,529
SIMMERED FOR A LONG TIME,
WHICH ENRICHES THE OVERALL FLAVOR

156
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:35,031

THE <i>SEONJI </i>HANGOVER SOUP IS FINALLY SERVED

161
00:07:52,182 --> 00:07:54,718
Wow, it looks so rich.

162
00:07:54,784 --> 00:07:56,419
-Doesn't it have a rich color?
-Yes.

163
00:07:56,486 --> 00:07:58,088
It looks like red bean porridge.

164
00:07:58,154 --> 00:08:00,590
IT'S THE COLOR OF RED BEAN PORRIDGE

165
00:08:01,424 --> 00:08:04,761
WHAT WILL THE BROTH TASTE LIKE
WITHOUT ANY SEASONING?

166
00:08:07,597 --> 00:08:09,866
-Thank you for the food.
-Enjoy.

167
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,269
I've never tried anything like this.

168
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:15,405
-How is it?
-It's amazing.

169
00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:18,708
<i>-It's beef bone broth.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>

-Look at this.
-Wow, it's rich.

172
00:08:25,482 --> 00:08:28,585
-Doesn't it taste like milk?
-Yes, it does.

173
00:08:28,652 --> 00:08:31,621
<i>-It's very creamy.</i>
<i>-Absolutely.</i>

174
00:08:33,657 --> 00:08:37,427
<i>-And it's very thick.</i>
<i>-It seeped into the broth.</i>

175
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:40,597
<i>It has a deep flavor.</i>

176
00:08:40,664 --> 00:08:42,365
EVERYONE CAN ENJOY THIS SOUP

177
00:08:42,432 --> 00:08:46,870
Is this <i>seonji </i>made from pork or beef?

178
00:08:46,937 --> 00:08:47,971
-It's beef.
-Beef.

179
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:52,642
-This is awesome.
-Attention, everyone.

180
00:08:53,276 --> 00:08:57,047
Please look at this big piece.

181
00:08:57,113 --> 00:08:58,582
A LARGE CHUNK OF <i>SEONJI</i>

182
00:08:58,648 --> 00:09:00,617
It's firm when you hold it
with chopsticks.

183
00:09:00,684 --> 00:09:04,154
It's firm, yet very tender in your mouth.

184
00:09:04,221 --> 00:09:06,423
<i>It's like pudding.</i>

185
00:09:06,489 --> 00:09:07,557
BOUNCY LIKE PUDDING

186
00:09:08,525 --> 00:09:10,660
TAKING A BITE OF <i>SEONJI</i>

187
00:09:10,727 --> 00:09:12,996
CAN'T HELP BUT EXCLAIM AT HOW GOOD IT IS

188
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:17,067
YUM

189
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:22,005
-Isn't the texture so nice?
-Yes.

190
00:09:22,072 --> 00:09:23,340
THE TEXTURE IS VERY NICE

191
00:09:23,406 --> 00:09:26,476
The quality of this <i>seonji</i>
is incredible because…

192
00:09:26,543 --> 00:09:29,880
It usually gets stuck between your teeth.

193
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:33,149
-Of course, but this has a nice texture.
-Right.

194
00:09:33,216 --> 00:09:35,352
-It cuts easily.
-Yes, I'm loving it.

195
00:09:35,418 --> 00:09:37,787
The texture is insane.

196
00:09:37,854 --> 00:09:39,990
THE <i>SEONJI </i>HERE BREAKS APART NICELY

197
00:09:40,056 --> 00:09:43,159
Is this <i>chalseonji?</i>

198
00:09:43,793 --> 00:09:46,396
Chalseonji <i>is made</i>
<i>without adding water to the blood.</i>

199
00:09:46,463 --> 00:09:49,933
<i>It's pure, fresh blood,</i>
<i>so it's different from ordinary </i>seonji.

200
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,735
<i>CHALSEONJI</i>
RICHER THAN ORDINARY <i>SEONJI</i>

201
00:09:51,801 --> 00:09:54,004
When you see <i>seonji </i>in hangover soup,

202
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:57,440
<i>-it usually has a lot of holes in it.</i>
<i>-Oh, yes, I know.</i>

203
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,110
<i>-It's because they mix it with water.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

204
00:10:00,176 --> 00:10:02,579
REGULAR <i>SEONJI </i>HAS TONS OF HOLES

205
00:10:02,646 --> 00:10:05,048
<i>-I don't see any holes here.</i>
<i>-You're right.</i>

206
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:08,518
<i>CHALSEONJI </i>HARDLY HAS ANY HOLES

207
00:10:08,585 --> 00:10:11,321
<i>Chalseonji </i>is way better for hangovers.

208
00:10:11,388 --> 00:10:13,590
-Does it help more?
-Yes, it does.

209
00:10:13,657 --> 00:10:17,561
-And I think it's a healthy meal.
-I agree.

210
00:10:17,627 --> 00:10:21,231
<i>-It has hemoglobin and iron.</i>
<i>-Everything.</i>

211
00:10:21,298 --> 00:10:25,201
<i>-That's right.</i>
<i>-It has everything your body needs.</i>

212
00:10:25,268 --> 00:10:26,703
PREVENTS ANEMIA,
BOOSTS IMMUNITY

213
00:10:29,372 --> 00:10:31,041
-Let me see.
-This is great.

214
00:10:31,107 --> 00:10:33,209
-Let me try it with kimchi.
-Sounds good.

215
00:10:33,276 --> 00:10:35,145
It goes very well with kimchi.

216
00:10:35,712 --> 00:10:37,414
I'll pair it with kimchi.

217
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,748
WHAT WILL THIS TASTE LIKE?

218
00:10:38,815 --> 00:10:39,816
With <i>seonji.</i>

219
00:10:45,255 --> 00:10:46,256
YUM

220
00:10:51,828 --> 00:10:54,731
CAN'T EAT IT QUIETLY BECAUSE IT'S SO TASTY

221
00:10:55,131 --> 00:10:56,833
This is unbelievable.

222
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:02,639
Try it with this.

223
00:11:02,706 --> 00:11:06,176
-The twisted peppers and anchovies?
-Yes.

224
00:11:06,243 --> 00:11:10,347
The texture of the stir-fried anchovies
complements the <i>seonji.</i>

225
00:11:10,413 --> 00:11:12,249
-Because the <i>seonji </i>is tender.
-Right.

226
00:11:12,315 --> 00:11:15,986
-And the anchovies are chewy.
-Exactly.

227
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:18,722
ADDS TEXTURE

228
00:11:22,726 --> 00:11:25,362
EYES WIDE OPEN

229
00:11:25,428 --> 00:11:26,796
Try it with this.

230
00:11:26,863 --> 00:11:28,665
They're perfect together.

231
00:11:28,732 --> 00:11:32,002
-It's slightly salty.
-Right.

232
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:36,006
It's sweet and salty at the same time.
I'm loving it.

233
00:11:36,072 --> 00:11:39,109
It's bursting with flavor.

234
00:11:39,676 --> 00:11:41,578
At first, I thought it was bland.

235
00:11:41,645 --> 00:11:44,147
But it's not if you eat it
with the side dishes.

236
00:11:44,214 --> 00:11:47,484
ENJOYING VARIOUS TEXTURES AND FLAVORS
WITH DIFFERENT SIDE DISHES

237
00:11:47,551 --> 00:11:49,119
Everyone, please look here.

238
00:11:49,185 --> 00:11:51,154
-That's the <i>ugeoji.</i>
-Exactly.

239
00:11:51,221 --> 00:11:52,556
It's awesome.

240
00:11:52,622 --> 00:11:53,757
<i>UGEOJI</i>

241
00:11:53,823 --> 00:11:55,058
Just what I thought.

242
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,127
-Geez, this <i>ugeoji.</i>
-<i>Ugeoji, </i>geez.

243
00:11:57,193 --> 00:11:58,862
DAD JOKES SIDE BY SIDE

244
00:11:59,195 --> 00:12:00,664
This is it.

245
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,432
THIS IS THE STUFF

246
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:06,136
DEVOURING

247
00:12:06,937 --> 00:12:08,338
I'm loving the <i>ugeoji.</i>

248
00:12:08,405 --> 00:12:11,474
I don't usually eat <i>ugeoji,</i>
but this is super tender.

249
00:12:13,543 --> 00:12:16,179
<i>You can tell it's good for you.</i>
<i>This is a diet food.</i>

250
00:12:16,246 --> 00:12:18,348
REFRESHING NAPA CABBAGE
AND BEEF BONE BROTH

251
00:12:18,415 --> 00:12:22,152
Different regions in Korea
have their own styles of hangover soup.

252
00:12:22,219 --> 00:12:23,220
-Sure.
-That's right.

253
00:12:23,687 --> 00:12:25,422
Tell me the ones you know.

254
00:12:25,488 --> 00:12:27,991
-Jeonju bean sprout soup.
-Exactly.

255
00:12:28,058 --> 00:12:32,295
JEONJU BEAN SPROUT HANGOVER SOUP
SOOTHES YOUR STOMACH

256
00:12:32,362 --> 00:12:34,097
<i>-Busan pork and rice soup.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

258
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:40,003
<i>-Yangpyeong hangover soup.</i>
<i>-That's right.</i>

259
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:43,273
HANGOVER SOUP IN GYEONGGI-DO,
MADE WITH BEEF INTESTINES AND <i>SEONJI</i>

260
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,808
<i>Gangwon-do moray eel stew.</i>

261
00:12:44,874 --> 00:12:46,877
BURSTS WITH THE REFRESHING TASTE OF FISH

262
00:12:46,943 --> 00:12:48,545
<i>There's one from Jeju Island, too.</i>

263
00:12:48,612 --> 00:12:51,414
<i>-It's bracken hangover soup.</i>
<i>-Wow, I've never had that.</i>

264
00:12:52,182 --> 00:12:53,583
In Jeonju…

265
00:12:54,517 --> 00:12:55,619
Naju beef bone soup.

266
00:12:56,887 --> 00:13:00,090
-Isn't Naju beef bone soup from Naju?
-My bad.

267
00:13:00,523 --> 00:13:02,659
EMBARRASSED

268

NAJU BEEF BONE SOUP HAS A CLEAR BROTH

269
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:13,370
SOUTH KOREA IS SERIOUS
ABOUT CURING HANGOVERS

270
00:13:15,005 --> 00:13:18,875
DAVID IS PASSIONATE ABOUT IT, TOO

271
00:13:22,746 --> 00:13:25,882
I don't want this place
to be featured on the show.

272
00:13:25,949 --> 00:13:27,817
I WANT TO KEEP THIS PLACE TO MYSELF

273
00:13:27,884 --> 00:13:29,853
Do you like this place?

274
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,388
-Yes.
-It's scrumptious.

275
00:13:31,454 --> 00:13:33,156
THUMBS UP!

276
00:13:33,223 --> 00:13:35,625
And guess what this is.

277
00:13:35,692 --> 00:13:37,994
There's something else in here.
Don't look.

278
00:13:38,061 --> 00:13:39,429
WHAT'S IN THE METAL JAR?

279
00:13:39,496 --> 00:13:41,097
-Salt?
-Salted shrimp?

280
00:13:41,164 --> 00:13:43,066
-Garlic?
-Perilla powder?

281
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:44,801
-Garlic?
-Taehoon got it right.

282
00:13:44,868 --> 00:13:47,737
-Wow, it's minced garlic.
-Yes, I love it.

283
00:13:47,804 --> 00:13:49,105
Do you put this in?

284
00:13:49,172 --> 00:13:52,409
HOW DO YOU USE THIS MINCED GARLIC?

285
00:13:52,475 --> 00:13:55,145
<i>-Add it to the soup.</i>
<i>-Got it.</i>

286
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:57,113
<i>-You have a certain order?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

287
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,050
MIX PLENTY OF GARLIC
INTO THE SOUP AND ENJOY

288
00:14:01,484 --> 00:14:04,421
WHAT WILL IT TASTE LIKE NOW?

289
00:14:04,487 --> 00:14:06,556
-Let me add it.
-Add lots of it.

290
00:14:06,623 --> 00:14:08,692
-Look at how he does it.
-Lots of garlic.

291
00:14:08,758 --> 00:14:11,962
Italians also love garlic.

292
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:17,200
It's interesting.

293
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:20,870
-It tastes sweet.
-It changed.

294
00:14:20,937 --> 00:14:23,106
-Isn't it sweet?
-I agree.

295
00:14:23,173 --> 00:14:25,275
It's like when you add onions.

296
00:14:25,342 --> 00:14:29,713
<i>It was slightly creamy,</i>
<i>but now it has a kick from the garlic.</i>

297
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:32,182
<i>-Yes, it's pungent.</i>
<i>-It has a sharp kick to it.</i>

298
00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:33,950
<i>It's nice and clean.</i>

299
00:14:34,017 --> 00:14:35,252
CLEANSES THE PALATE

300
00:14:36,219 --> 00:14:38,521
THE FOODIE BROTHERS CHOW DOWN THE FOOD

301
00:14:38,588 --> 00:14:40,924
I should bring my parents here.

302
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:42,993
I think my father would really like this.

303
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:45,962
It would be nice
to deliver this to your house.

304
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:48,932
I would order it
when I've lost my appetite.

305
00:14:51,768 --> 00:14:54,671
You know we mixed garlic in the soup.

306
00:14:55,305 --> 00:14:59,376
What do you usually add after the garlic?
Do you put this in?

307
00:14:59,442 --> 00:15:00,911
I add this as well.

308
00:15:02,546 --> 00:15:05,415
SAUCE THAT WILL MAKE IT SPICY

309
00:15:05,482 --> 00:15:08,251
-Let's try it.
-Sure, why don't we?

310
00:15:08,852 --> 00:15:10,887
Aren't you adding too much, Fabri?

311
00:15:10,954 --> 00:15:13,123
No, this is the right amount.

312
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,896
ADDED A SPOONFUL OF SAUCE

313
00:15:20,497 --> 00:15:23,567
TAEHOON IS LOST IN THOUGHT

314
00:15:23,633 --> 00:15:24,634
Look at that.

315
00:15:24,701 --> 00:15:26,069
BEFORE THE FOOD WAS SERVED…

316
00:15:26,136 --> 00:15:29,539
-"The red sauce is super spicy."
-Super.

317
00:15:29,606 --> 00:15:33,276
…TAEHOON TRIED THE SAUCE

318
00:15:33,343 --> 00:15:36,713
-The spiciness really hits at the end.
-Yes, it sure does.

319
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,683
-He's sweating.
-Don't drink water.

320
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:42,652
-Dang, it has a spicy kick at the end.
-Look at your sweat.

321
00:15:43,486 --> 00:15:44,754
Let's go, Taehoon.

322
00:15:45,488 --> 00:15:46,489
But it was too…

323
00:15:46,556 --> 00:15:47,557
TAEHOON IS FLUSTERED

324
00:15:47,624 --> 00:15:48,658
Isn't that too much?

325
00:15:49,492 --> 00:15:51,761
HE'S HESITANT TO TRY IT

326
00:15:52,062 --> 00:15:53,063
Let me add some.

327
00:15:53,797 --> 00:15:55,098
Wow, that much?

328
00:15:55,165 --> 00:15:58,435
-Yes, I can handle spicy food.
-Really?

329
00:15:58,501 --> 00:16:00,437
THE KOTALIAN IS CONFIDENT ABOUT SPICY FOOD

330
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:02,572
I'm confident, too.

331
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,476
THAT'S CUTE

332
00:16:07,043 --> 00:16:09,946
WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD FOR HIM?

333
00:16:10,013 --> 00:16:15,051
THOROUGHLY MIX THE SAUCE INTO THE SOUP

334
00:16:16,253 --> 00:16:19,089
It turned slightly red.
It looks like spicy beef soup.

335
00:16:19,155 --> 00:16:20,490
THE BROTH TURNED RED

336
00:16:21,758 --> 00:16:25,829
WHAT WILL THE SOUP TASTE LIKE
AFTER ADDING THE SPICY SAUCE?

337
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:34,004
SWEATING RIGHT AWAY

338
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,138
Wait a second.

339
00:16:38,742 --> 00:16:41,845
Wow, it tastes different again.

340
00:16:48,385 --> 00:16:52,789
-It pops your eyes open right away.
-This is it.

341
00:16:53,456 --> 00:16:55,625
-This is what hangover soup is.
-Right.

342
00:16:55,692 --> 00:16:57,127
FABRI ENJOYS THE SPICY TASTE

343
00:16:57,193 --> 00:17:00,063
<i>At first,</i>
<i>the rich flavor fills your mouth.</i>

344
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,567
<i>-And then it's got a spicy finish.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>

345
00:17:03,633 --> 00:17:06,136
<i>It has a healthy spicy flavor.</i>

346
00:17:06,202 --> 00:17:09,973
-It's like when we eat Cheongyang peppers.
-It's nice and spicy.

347
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,809
You get to eat three types of soup
for just 9,000 won.

348
00:17:12,876 --> 00:17:14,010
That's right.

349
00:17:14,077 --> 00:17:16,379
Isn't that incredible?

350
00:17:16,446 --> 00:17:18,148
-Right.
-They all taste different.

351
00:17:18,215 --> 00:17:19,583
It's amazing.

352
00:17:20,684 --> 00:17:26,289
AT FIRST, IT TASTES CREAMY AND RICH

353
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:33,029
ADDING THE PUNGENT GARLIC
DEEPENS THE FLAVOR

354
00:17:34,297 --> 00:17:39,936
AND ADDING THE SPICY SAUCE MAKES IT SPICY

355
00:17:40,604 --> 00:17:44,708
IT'S TIME TO ENJOY THE COMPLETED VERSION
OF THIS <i>SEONJI </i>HANGOVER SOUP

356
00:17:44,774 --> 00:17:46,176
THIS IS IT!

357
00:17:46,243 --> 00:17:47,978
<i>It's unbelievable.</i>

358
00:17:48,044 --> 00:17:51,514
I like having all of the different
textures and flavors in one bite.

359
00:17:52,782 --> 00:17:54,050
How come he eats so well?

360
00:17:54,117 --> 00:17:56,052
MOUTH FULL OF FOOD

361
00:17:57,187 --> 00:18:00,891
ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS

362
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:07,230
YOU HAVE TO DRINK IT FROM THE BOWL

363
00:18:08,098 --> 00:18:10,200
Bravo, David.

364
00:18:12,002 --> 00:18:14,337
It looked like a scene
from a Joseon dynasty drama.

365
00:18:15,605 --> 00:18:18,308
And they offer unlimited refills
for everything.

366
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,743
-We can have more.
-Exactly.

367
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:20,810
UNLIMITED REFILLS

368
00:18:20,877 --> 00:18:22,145
This is a nice restaurant.

369
00:18:22,212 --> 00:18:24,047
I can't believe it's unlimited.

370
00:18:24,447 --> 00:18:27,417
RESPECT TO THIS PLACE

371
00:18:27,484 --> 00:18:28,919
I ate everything.

372
00:18:28,985 --> 00:18:30,453
Already?

373
00:18:31,488 --> 00:18:33,256
DUJUN HAS NEVER EATEN THIS FAST

374
00:18:33,323 --> 00:18:36,927
<i>-It was scrumptious.</i>
<i>-Let's get a refill of this.</i>

375
00:18:36,993 --> 00:18:38,028
CLEANED HIS PLATE

376
00:18:39,262 --> 00:18:40,263
Sir.

377
00:18:40,664 --> 00:18:41,698
Could we get refills?

378
00:18:41,765 --> 00:18:44,434
I'm sorry.
I'm a bit embarrassed to say this.

379
00:18:44,501 --> 00:18:46,202
But could we please get some more?

380
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,973
-A big portion, please.
-Sure.

381
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,741
THANK YOU FOR THE REFILLS

382
00:18:51,808 --> 00:18:54,144
-Can we get them separately?
-Of course.

383
00:18:54,211 --> 00:18:56,947
-We can order only <i>seonji.</i>
-Right.

384
00:18:58,248 --> 00:19:01,351
Sir, are you okay with offering refills?

385
00:19:01,418 --> 00:19:03,453
Yes, it's all right.

386
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,822
I haven't changed
the price for three years,

387
00:19:05,889 --> 00:19:07,791
and I still offer unlimited refills.

388
00:19:07,857 --> 00:19:10,160
How long have you run this place?

389
00:19:10,227 --> 00:19:14,331
My elementary school friend's mother
had been running this place for 40 years.

390
00:19:14,397 --> 00:19:16,233
-Here?
-No, in Cheonho-dong.

391
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:18,868
<i>Oh, that's why it says</i>
<i>"From Cheonho-dong" out front.</i>

392
00:19:18,935 --> 00:19:20,971
<i>Yes, we moved from Cheonho-dong to here.</i>

393
00:19:21,037 --> 00:19:22,672
<i>-There's history behind it.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

394
00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:24,674
THE RESTAURANT MOVED HERE 20 YEARS AGO

395
00:19:24,741 --> 00:19:27,510
-I've been running it for six years.
-I see.

396
00:19:27,577 --> 00:19:29,346
HE TOOK OVER THE RESTAURANT

397
00:19:29,412 --> 00:19:32,449
-I come here often.
-Right.

398
00:19:32,515 --> 00:19:37,554
The broth is usually clear,
but now it's very thick and rich.

399
00:19:37,621 --> 00:19:39,322
<i>It looks like red bean porridge.</i>

400
00:19:39,389 --> 00:19:41,758
<i>It's clearer in the morning.</i>

401
00:19:44,694 --> 00:19:45,929
<i>Why is that?</i>

402
00:19:45,996 --> 00:19:48,832
<i>-You know, the </i>seonji <i>is a bit salty.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

403
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,203
So, I only add
a little <i>seonji </i>in the mornings.

404
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,505
<i>You usually come here at that time,</i>
<i>so it's clear.</i>

405
00:19:56,773 --> 00:20:00,210
THE MORNING BROTH IS LIGHTER AND CLEARER
THAN THE AFTERNOON BROTH

406
00:20:00,277 --> 00:20:02,012
The broth is clear at first,

407
00:20:02,078 --> 00:20:06,750
but it gets richer as I add more beef
bone broth and <i>seonji </i>throughout the day.

408
00:20:06,816 --> 00:20:09,452
<i>It draws out the rich flavor,</i>
<i>making it thick.</i>

409
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:10,787
SIMMERS THE BROTH EVERY DAY

410
00:20:11,388 --> 00:20:14,558
THE SECRET TO HIS RICH HANGOVER SOUP

411
00:20:15,725 --> 00:20:18,895
BEEF BONE BROTH IS CONSTANTLY
POURED IN WHILE IT SIMMERS

412
00:20:19,496 --> 00:20:22,599
ADDS MORE <i>SEONJI </i>AS WELL

413
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:26,536
THE BROTH CHANGES
TO A DEEPER COLOR OVER TIME

414
00:20:27,571 --> 00:20:31,775
CLEAR BROTH IN THE MORNINGS,
RICH BROTH IN THE AFTERNOONS

415
00:20:31,841 --> 00:20:35,979
<i>So, you can have</i>
<i>a clear broth in the morning.</i>

416
00:20:36,046 --> 00:20:38,348
<i>And you can have</i>
<i>a rich broth in the afternoon.</i>

417
00:20:38,415 --> 00:20:40,717
COME IN THE AFTERNOON
IF YOU WANT RICHER FLAVOR

418
00:20:40,784 --> 00:20:41,785
Hold on…

419
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:44,321
4 EXTRA BOWLS OF <i>SEONJI </i>HANGOVER SOUP

420
00:20:46,623 --> 00:20:48,959
-It comes in a new bowl.
-It looks the same.

421
00:20:49,025 --> 00:20:50,160
It's the same amount.

422
00:20:51,561 --> 00:20:53,763
EVEN THE BOWLS ARE SIMILAR IN SIZE

423
00:20:54,464 --> 00:20:56,866
<i>-This is insane.</i>
<i>-We're starting all over again.</i>

424
00:20:56,933 --> 00:20:58,101
ALMOST THE SAME PORTION

425
00:20:58,568 --> 00:21:00,570
THE FOODIE BROTHERS HAVE ANOTHER BOWL

426
00:21:00,637 --> 00:21:03,173
-Whoa, this is rich.
-I'm loving this.

427
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,010
Honestly, I don't enjoy drinking alcohol,

428
00:21:07,077 --> 00:21:11,748
but I might consider drinking
if I could have this hangover soup.

429
00:21:12,382 --> 00:21:14,417
And the soju and beer are only 4,000 won.

430
00:21:14,484 --> 00:21:15,919
You can't find that anywhere.

431
00:21:15,986 --> 00:21:17,554
And the <i>makgeolli </i>is 3,000 won.

432
00:21:18,488 --> 00:21:20,323
THAT'S A REASONABLE PRICE IN SEOUL

433
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:25,962
After seeing that it's only 4,000 won,
I'm suddenly craving alcohol.

434
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:28,531
-What do you want?
-The hair of the dog.

435
00:21:28,598 --> 00:21:29,866
-Really?
-Yes.

436
00:21:29,933 --> 00:21:34,938
After having this spicy broth,
I would like some alcohol right away.

437
00:21:35,005 --> 00:21:36,640
-Would you like some?
-Of course.

438
00:21:36,706 --> 00:21:41,111
-Could we please get a bottle of soju?
-Got it.

439
00:21:41,177 --> 00:21:43,580
-Soju and beer?
-No, just soju.

440
00:21:43,647 --> 00:21:47,083
You should take a straight shot of it
with this soup.

441
00:21:47,784 --> 00:21:48,785
Just soju.

442
00:21:49,252 --> 00:21:52,155
A BOTTLE OF SOJU IS BROUGHT OUT RIGHT AWAY
FOR A HANGOVER DRINK

443
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:59,095
MAKING A WHIRLWIND IS A MUST

444
00:22:03,366 --> 00:22:04,367
It's not working.

445
00:22:07,671 --> 00:22:09,739
Gosh, hand it over.

446
00:22:14,077 --> 00:22:17,214
SUCCEEDED ON HIS FIRST TRY

447
00:22:17,881 --> 00:22:18,982
TAP

448
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:20,417
-Let's go.
-Is he Korean?

449
00:22:21,251 --> 00:22:22,419
I can't do this stuff.

450
00:22:22,485 --> 00:22:23,820
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

451
00:22:25,255 --> 00:22:26,890
Thank you.

452
00:22:26,957 --> 00:22:28,558
PERFECT DRINKING ETIQUETTE

453
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:30,927
-Here you go, David.
-Thanks.

454
00:22:31,695 --> 00:22:35,165
-I'll pour some for Fabri.
-Thanks.

455
00:22:35,765 --> 00:22:39,269
-Is Fabri older than David?
-Yes, he is.

456
00:22:39,336 --> 00:22:42,706
I'm a middle-aged guy, okay?

457
00:22:42,772 --> 00:22:44,874
In Brindisi, we say, <i>"Salute."</i>

458
00:22:44,941 --> 00:22:47,244
<i>-Salute?</i>
-Yes, that's what we say.

459
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:50,046
-We say it when we celebrate.
-I see.

460
00:22:50,113 --> 00:22:53,416
It means, "To your health."

461
00:22:53,483 --> 00:22:56,086
-But we're drinking alcohol.
-And we say that.

462
00:22:56,152 --> 00:22:58,188
That's contradictory.

463
00:22:58,255 --> 00:23:00,824
<i>-Salute.</i>
<i>-Salute.</i>

464
00:23:05,562 --> 00:23:07,530
THIS IS THE STUFF

465
00:23:08,598 --> 00:23:10,934
Do I have to turn away
from the viewers or from you?

466
00:23:11,001 --> 00:23:12,302
I'll just drink it.

467
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:16,907
Dang, it's sweet.

468
00:23:16,973 --> 00:23:18,408
I'm loving this.

469
00:23:19,209 --> 00:23:21,611
Now this is the perfect meal.

470
00:23:21,678 --> 00:23:22,679
Soju…

471
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,816
-Soju and…
-He's totally Korean.

472
00:23:26,883 --> 00:23:29,553
IT'S HILARIOUS EVEN TO HIM

473
00:23:30,453 --> 00:23:34,958
THIS SOUP MAKES EVEN A KOTALIAN CRAVE SOJU

474
00:23:35,025 --> 00:23:37,227
-I made this earlier.
-Okay.

475
00:23:37,294 --> 00:23:41,898
We usually dip meat
in ground pepper and salt.

476
00:23:41,965 --> 00:23:45,602
Try dipping it here
since we have salt and ground pepper.

477
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:48,204
-It's tasty.
-Like sesame oil and salt?

478
00:23:48,271 --> 00:23:49,272
Try it.

479
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:50,440
DIP

480
00:23:50,507 --> 00:23:53,076
-Dip it.
-I love the smell of pepper.

481
00:23:53,843 --> 00:23:55,011
-Hold on.
-It's good.

482
00:23:55,078 --> 00:23:58,615
-The ground pepper pairs well with this.
-It's great with soju.

483
00:23:58,682 --> 00:23:59,783
THE PERFECT SOJU SNACK

484
00:23:59,849 --> 00:24:01,151
It's excellent.

485
00:24:01,218 --> 00:24:02,786
-It's like pork liver.
-Absolutely.

486
00:24:02,852 --> 00:24:04,888
-That's what I thought.
-Definitely.

487
00:24:04,955 --> 00:24:07,023
It's like very tender pork liver.

488
00:24:07,624 --> 00:24:10,794
<i>-It's the perfect bar snack.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>

489
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,363
THE <i>SEONJI </i>BECOMES A BAR SNACK

490
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,699
You really enjoy eating food.

491
00:24:15,765 --> 00:24:18,168
-You try different cuisines.
-Of course. I'm a chef.

492
00:24:18,235 --> 00:24:21,104
What made you want to become a chef?

493
00:24:21,171 --> 00:24:22,606
Let's see.

494
00:24:22,672 --> 00:24:28,578
When I was four years old,
my parents opened a restaurant.

495
00:24:28,645 --> 00:24:32,482
And I grew up in that restaurant.

496
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,119
I didn't go to a culinary school
or anything.

497
00:24:36,753 --> 00:24:40,790
I was a student when my parents
were running the restaurant,

498
00:24:40,857 --> 00:24:41,992
<i>so I helped them out.</i>

499
00:24:42,058 --> 00:24:43,393
HE LEARNED BY HELPING

500
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:47,163
<i>I enjoyed cooking while helping them.</i>

501
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,233
That's what made me want to become a chef.

502
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,801
-Was that the turning point?
-Yes.

503
00:24:52,402 --> 00:24:55,438
FABRI DREAMED OF BECOMING A CHEF
AT HIS PARENTS' RESTAURANT

504
00:24:55,505 --> 00:24:58,575
After I started cooking in the restaurant,

505
00:24:58,642 --> 00:25:01,177
we got a M*chelin St*r
after only two years.

506
00:25:02,979 --> 00:25:05,315
-You got it after teaching yourself.
-Right.

507
00:25:05,382 --> 00:25:06,383
IMPRESSIVE

508
00:25:06,449 --> 00:25:10,620
After that, I became Chef Fabri.

509
00:25:12,155 --> 00:25:16,259
FABRI ACHIEVED HIS DREAM
AFTER COOKING SERIOUSLY FOR TWO YEARS

510
00:25:16,326 --> 00:25:18,295
<i>I maintained</i>
<i>the M*chelin St*r for 15 years.</i>

511
00:25:18,361 --> 00:25:19,663
<i>Wow, that's incredible.</i>

512
00:25:20,931 --> 00:25:24,668
-I needed a sous chef.
-Okay.

513
00:25:24,734 --> 00:25:28,238
<i>Just by chance,</i>
<i>Koreans were my sous chefs.</i>

514
00:25:28,305 --> 00:25:31,274
<i>I worked with Koreans a lot.</i>

515
00:25:31,341 --> 00:25:35,445
<i>And I got to learn a lot</i>
<i>about the Korean food and culture.</i>

516
00:25:35,512 --> 00:25:36,680
That's what happened.

517
00:25:36,746 --> 00:25:41,851
In 2016, I participated
in a Korean food contest in Milan.

518
00:25:41,918 --> 00:25:43,853
-And I won.
-That's amazing.

519
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:49,659
The winner's prize was a trip to Korea,
so I traveled to this country.

520
00:25:50,327 --> 00:25:52,495
HE FELL IN LOVE WITH THE CULTURE
AND MOVED HERE

521
00:25:52,562 --> 00:25:54,231
Dang, this is insane.

522
00:25:54,297 --> 00:25:56,199
This is the heart.

523
00:25:56,266 --> 00:25:58,702
HE KNOWS KOREAN FOOD
EVEN BETTER THAN KOREANS DO

524
00:25:59,002 --> 00:26:00,537
It's not gamey at all.

525
00:26:02,305 --> 00:26:06,810
THE ORIGINAL KOTALIAN
WHO LOVES KOREAN FOOD

526
00:26:06,877 --> 00:26:07,878
Nice.

527
00:26:08,979 --> 00:26:13,350
HE'S CURRENTLY PROMOTING KOREA
AS A KIMCHI AMBASSADOR

528
00:26:13,416 --> 00:26:16,887
And now, we add rice.

529
00:26:17,554 --> 00:26:19,556
Oh, that's why you didn't eat rice.

530
00:26:19,623 --> 00:26:22,459
-Right, that's the fourth way to eat this.
-You saved it.

531
00:26:22,525 --> 00:26:25,862
Now, add the rice to the soup.

532
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,999
Mix it in and eat it.

533
00:26:29,065 --> 00:26:30,600
-It's <i>gukbap.</i>
-Yes.

534
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:33,036
<i>This is the fourth way to eat this soup.</i>

535
00:26:33,103 --> 00:26:35,839
<i>-It's a hearty meal.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>

536
00:26:35,906 --> 00:26:37,674
TURNED INTO <i>SEONJI </i>HANGOVER <i>GUKBAP</i>

537
00:26:41,411 --> 00:26:42,412
YUM

538
00:26:47,384 --> 00:26:49,953
-It tastes different.
-Absolutely.

539
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,856
<i>The rice adds a different texture.</i>

540
00:26:52,923 --> 00:26:55,792
I love the mix of textures.

541
00:26:55,859 --> 00:26:59,596
GOBBLES IT UP

542
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,432
This is the perfect finish to the meal.

543
00:27:03,266 --> 00:27:06,703
You introduced us
to a fantastic restaurant.

544
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:08,338
I absolutely agree.

545
00:27:08,405 --> 00:27:11,441
I've had this dish countless times,
but this one's totally new.

546
00:27:11,508 --> 00:27:15,345
I've never had <i>seonji </i>this fresh.

547
00:27:16,146 --> 00:27:17,347
VERY GLAD

548
00:27:17,414 --> 00:27:19,883
What makes a place your go-to spot?

549
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:23,286
Do you have any standards,
such as price or taste?

550
00:27:24,087 --> 00:27:27,757
-My personal standard is…
-Okay.

551
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:30,994
-…the sign.
-I see.

552
00:27:31,061 --> 00:27:33,763
It needs to have an old sign.

553
00:27:34,531 --> 00:27:41,471
That means the owner
only focuses on the food.

554
00:27:41,538 --> 00:27:42,772
Don't you agree?

555
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:45,542
And the second standard is
having one item on the menu.

556
00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:49,913
-Just one?
-Yes, one or two dishes are okay.

557
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,147
Those are my standards.

558
00:27:51,214 --> 00:27:54,150
-Focusing on a single dish.
-Exactly.

559
00:27:54,217 --> 00:27:56,686
That's a distinctive feature
of Korean restaurants.

560
00:27:56,753 --> 00:28:02,092
Regular restaurants in Italy
always have various dishes on their menu.

561
00:28:02,158 --> 00:28:06,630
I was shocked when I first came here
and found out there was only one dish.

562
00:28:06,696 --> 00:28:08,331
I thought that was so cool.

563
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:10,634
But there's a charm to it.

564
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:16,673
They put all their effort
into one dish, right?

565
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,243
-It's like true craftsmanship.
-Exactly.

566
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:25,415
Honestly, I have lots of good restaurants
I want to share with you.

567
00:28:25,482 --> 00:28:26,650
-Tell us.
-In Korea?

568
00:28:26,716 --> 00:28:30,253
I've learned a lot
while living here for six years.

569
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,822
I spend a lot of time researching.

570
00:28:32,889 --> 00:28:34,291
It's too bad.

571
00:28:34,357 --> 00:28:37,060
FABRI IS SAD TO HAVE SHARED
ONLY ONE RESTAURANT

572
00:28:37,127 --> 00:28:40,864
If you invite me one more time…

573
00:28:40,931 --> 00:28:42,265
-Oh, yes.
-Of course.

574
00:28:42,332 --> 00:28:45,335
-I'll gladly introduce you to them.
-You're welcome anytime.

575
00:28:45,402 --> 00:28:47,637
Let's grant Fabri's wish.

576
00:28:47,704 --> 00:28:49,606
I would love that.

577
00:28:49,673 --> 00:28:52,776
I hope we meet Chef Fabri again.

578
00:28:52,842 --> 00:28:54,811
-Thank you for the food.
-Thanks.

579
00:28:56,046 --> 00:28:59,983
WE WILL BE WAITING FOR CHEF FABRI'S CALL

580
00:29:01,084 --> 00:29:03,119
YEONGHWAJEONG HANGOVER SOUP
