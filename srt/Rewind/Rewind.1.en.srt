00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,957
[school bell ringing]

2
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,918
- [pupils] Good morning, Teacher!
- Teacher Pam! Teacher Pam!

3
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,128
I'm sorry I'm late!

4
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,756
- [John] It won't happen again.
- [Pam] You promise?

5
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,215
[Pam] You may sit.

6
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:53,762
Class, today, we will be rehearsing
our dance for our school event,

7
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,473
and your partner will be your seatmate.

8
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,351
So, boys and girls,
we will be having our two-minute dance.

9
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,479
John, your partner is Mary.

10
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,939
[quirky music playing]

11
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,024
Smile!

12
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:10,487
- Show me that smile!
- [Mary] John is my first love.

13
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,572
Even when he's grumpy,

14
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,657
I know how to make him smile.

15
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,284
- [quirky music continues]
- [chuckles]

16
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,870
[Mary] I don't know
what I like about John.

17
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,247
But the more time I spend with him,

18
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,833
the more I get to know him.

19
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,753
John doesn't smile much

20
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,463
because he's lonely.

21
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:32,592
So, I have promised myself
to make him happy every day.

22
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:33,927
I love you.

23
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,304
I love you.

24
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,847
[both chuckle]

25
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:44,062
[soft music playing]

26
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,189
Did you know that if you make a wish

27
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,441
while looking at heaven,

28
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,194
it will surely come true?

29
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,321
- You wanna know why?
- Why?

30
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,365
Because you're facing God.

31
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,367
Just like this.

32
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,078
[John] Shall we try it?

33
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,709
This is my wish.

34
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,254
[Mary gasps]

35
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:15,426
- John?
- [Mary] Until every day becomes forever.

36
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,595
I wish to be the best man for you.

37
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,056
Mary, will you marry me?

38
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,185
[chuckles] Yes!

39
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,229
[priest] You may now kiss the bride.

40
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,189
[guests cheering, applauding]

41
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,776
[Mary] At last, it's us till our last.

42
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:34,863
[both chuckle]

43
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:41,953
[Mary] Whenever I'm with John,
I feel like everything is all right.

44
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:47,000
He takes care of me,
so I take care of him too.

45
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,421
- Yes.
- [laughs]

46
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,839
How are we doing guys?

47
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,257
Oh, Mary's a good student.

48
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,508
She's doing very well.

49
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,885
- Yeah, it looks beautiful.
- Thank you.

50
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,678
[Mary] I have a lot of dreams.

51
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,515
One of them
is to build a family with John.

52
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,979
[both chuckle]

53
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,231
- [laughs]
- Come here.

54
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:16,821
[Mary] Because I know, someday,
he will be a good father.

55
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,698
[priest] I welcome you
into His holy people.

56
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,533
[soft music playing]

57
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:24,412
[Mary] But of course, it's not always easy
and it's not always happy.

58
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,372
- [photographer] Smile.
- Smile, baby.

59
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,125
Sometimes, you have to
make tough decisions

60
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:32,795
and make sacrifices.

61
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:37,967
But at the end of the day,
it's all for your family.

62
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,220
[indistinct chatter]

63
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,305
Do you still remember your vows?

64
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,598
[Mary] Hon?

65
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,516
Hon, where should we put this?

66
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,268
- You decide.
- Huh?

67
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,686
[Mary] For richer, for poorer.

68
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,605
Okay, I'll take care of it.

69
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,982
Dad! Look, it's Grandpa!

70
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,067
Make him leave!

71
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:55,818
Pa…

72
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,737
Austin, go to your room.

73
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,949
[Mary] To love him on the days
he's difficult to understand.

74
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,368
Why did you let him in?

75
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,535
John, I just wanted…

76
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:08,331
Of all people, you know
very well what he did to me!

77
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,249
- John!
- Damn it!

78
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,417
- [glass shatters]
- [breath quivers]

79
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:15,421
[Mary] To love him more on the days
he's difficult to love

80
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:22,679
- [morose music playing]
- [keyboard clacking]

81
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,934
- One, two, three, smile!
- [camera clicks]

82
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:28,893
- Wait.
- [camera clicks]

83
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,353
Let's do one more.

84
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,854
Let me see.

85
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,149
She knows what to do. Come on!

86
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,235
- Come on!
- [indistinct chatter]

87
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,528
[Mary] Sometimes I ask myself…

88
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,529
Okay. Smile!

89
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,532
- One, two, three, smile!
- [Mary] If not in this lifetime…

90
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,410
- Smile!
- In our next life…

91
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,745
Would you still choose me?

92
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:52,959
[morose music continues]

93
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:59,424
[music turns bright]

94
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,986
[music fades]

95
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:27,118
- [sizzling]
- [Austin playing the piano]

96
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:38,254
[playing bright tune]

97
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:39,714
[Mary] Morning!

98
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,967
[John] Yes. Yes, please, Hannah.
Right away.

99
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,470
[phone thuds]

100
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:46,804
[notifications chiming]

101
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,973
Good morning, John.

102
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,476
Please print this.

103
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,393
Okay.

104
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,479
Where is Ningning?

105
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,440
Why are you looking for Ningning?

106
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,941
Why don't you say,

107
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,278
"Thank you, honey,
for my beautiful breakfast."

108
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,155
Ningning's here,

109
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:08,076
but I'll prepare your food
so you'll be lucky.

110
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:11,079
I know that today is important to you.

111
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,831
[breathes deeply]

112
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,751
- [chuckles]
- [piano notes continue]

113
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,086
Hello?

114
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,671
What were you talking about
in the group chat?

115
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:21,631
You know…

116
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,424
I already told you this!

117
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,718
Anybody but Vivian!

118
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,845
That's a simple instruction!

119
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,097
Take it back!

120
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,014
Wait.

121
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,432
Aus! Aus, please!

122
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,892
- [Mary] I'll get him.
- [John] Dad's on the phone!

123
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,936
Keep it down, okay?

124
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,062
- Yes!
- Let's go.

125
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:39,273
She can't have that account!

126
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,110
[Austin] Sorry, Dad.

127
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,027
Thank you!

128
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,245
[exhales deeply]

129
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,412
Dad?

130
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,580
[John] Yes?

131
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:58,709
Tomorrow is our Parents and Teachers Day.

132
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,921
- Mm-hm.
- [Austin] Dad, please come.

133
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,131
- Mm-hm.
- Yes?

134
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,091
- [high-five]
- [soft music playing]

135
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,135
Dad, I wrote the play.

136
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,219
I'll also play the piano!

137
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,345
I'm the star!

138
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:11,931
[Austin] Look!

139
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,102
Daddy, please come!

140
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,103
Don't be late.

141
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,272
Actually, it's okay if you're
late as long as you come.

142
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,648
I always come.

143
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,693
I was there during your football tryouts.

144
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,320
[Austin] But I didn't make it
onto the team.

145
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,823
But here, Dad, I'm the star.

146
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:29,907
Promise.

147
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,036
- [Mary] Bye, son!
- [Austin] Bye, Mom!

148
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,872
Honey, did you forget something?

149
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,415
Oh, right.

150
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,332
Thank you.

151
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,170
[soft music continues]

152
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,796
[car door closes]

153
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,592
[car leaving]

154
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:51,471
Our Asian expansion has been
piecemeal and reactive.

155
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,807
We only acted when unofficial resellers

156
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,477
started shipping cases of our whiskey

157
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,978
to other regions.

158
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,400
- So as Sir John directed, we will be…
- Excuse me.

159
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,861
Lucio, why don't you tell us
something we don't know?

160
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:12,033
Isn't this just a duplication
of my earlier proposal

161
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:14,577
on the East Asian expansion?

162
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,828
Nope.

163
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:16,996
Huge difference.

164
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:22,877
Because your plan
is anchored on a Japan launch.

165
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:26,756
That's why our plan is a more practical

166
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,760
South Korea, Taiwan,
Indonesia, and Malaysia blitz.

167
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,387
Isn't this a cowardly approach?

168
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,600
We should be hitting
the biggest whiskey market.

169
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:43,147
I'd say it's us being more
cautious than foolish.

170
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:47,235
Hermie, am I not the Business Dev Head?

171
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,363
Why wasn't this run through me?

172
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,949
Well, actually, this is our way
of running it through you

173
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,992
by inviting you to this meeting.

174
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:56,953
Excuse me. [coughs]

175
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,037
[coughs]

176
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,082
[coughs]

177
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:01,999
Excuse.

178
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,044
[coughs]

179
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,546
- [Lucio] Are you okay?
- [coughing continues]

180
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,631
- Hannah, get some water.
- [coughing continues]

181
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,174
Are you okay?

182
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,218
I think I'm just allergic to Vivian's ego.

183
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,844
[chuckles, coughs]

184
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,012
- Thank you.
- Funny.

185
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,348
Let's adjourn this meeting.

186
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,976
[overlapping chatter]

187
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:20,893
[coughs]

188
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,440
What if it's a heart attack?

189
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,943
Don't you think about me and your son?!

190
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,903
[John] What are you talking about?
Are you my wife?

191
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:35,658
I'm just telling you what Mary
would possibly tell you.

192
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,203
It's just heartburn. Drop it.

193
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,997
Just don't tell her what happened.

194
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,458
Hannah, tell me what's next
on my schedule.

195
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,376
[Hannah] Yes, sir.

196
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,337
You have a dance rehearsal in ten minutes.

197
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,464
Sir Lucio scheduled it.

198
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,342
No, cancel it.

199
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,011
Cancel it.

200
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,054
We can't cancel the rehearsal.

201
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:02,101
We have to have the best prod number
at Sir Hermie's birthday party!

202
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,603
Because after that,

203
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:07,064
he will announce

204
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,442
your most talked about promotion.

205
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,986
- Promotion!
- [chuckles]

206
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,571
Shut up!

207
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:14,989
Sir,

208
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,408
you're Sir Hermie's golden boy!

209
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,827
You share the same birth month
and horoscope.

210
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,246
He treats you like a son.

211
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,081
He loves you so much!

212
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,167
That's already in the bag!

213
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,210
Besides, sir,

214
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,297
Sir Hermie is retiring.

215
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:36,552
Don't you notice his gums
giving up on his dentures?

216
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,095
They fall off every time he talks!

217
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,639
He even has to suction them!

218
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,307
[imitating Hermie] "John." [teeth sucking]

219
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,017
He needs to keep them in his mouth.

220
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,477
Cut it.

221
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,064
Yes, I know.
His time on earth is almost over.

222
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,858
That's why he smells like a grandpa.

223
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,319
Old people smell like menthol, you know.

224
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,279
So he always wears a floral shirt,

225
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,947
so he can hide his grandpa smell.

226
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,949
He wants to look like Ace Ventura.

227
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,787
I wore casual clothes
and now I'm Ace Ventura.

228
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,456
I wore this because
it's my birthday party tonight.

229
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,669
[nervous chuckle]

230
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:13,297
- Sir.
- Sir, what I mean is…

231
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,217
I really like this floral look on you!

232
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,929
You look like a tourist from Hawaii.

233
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,598
Sir, what made you visit us?

234
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,683
I'm here to talk to your "sir"

235
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,937
to discuss the people that
we'll be laying off.

236
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,189
- [quirky music playing]
- Layoff?

237
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,691
- [quirky music continues]
- [gasps]

238
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:33,943
Sir, sor…

239
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,528
- Shall we go?
- Sir.

240
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:38,697
Sir. I was just kidding.

241
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,492
I really like your Hawaiian look.

242
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,911
Help me.

243
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,622
[Leonora] That cake looks deadly!

244
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:49,041
It's a carrot cake.

245
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,626
- Still a healthier option.
- [both chuckle]

246
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,670
Tell Hermie to take his meds.

247
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,966
By the way, Ma, what time is your flight?

248
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,176
I can ask Wally to drive you.

249
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,136
No need.

250
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,596
I'll just book a ride.

251
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:08,185
Don't forget to send me pictures
and videos of Austin's play.

252
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,604
Dear, pass me a fork.

253
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,983
Ma, it's John's birthday next week.

254
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,443
I'm thinking of surprising him.

255
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:18,612
He wants to stay at home,

256
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,907
so I'll surprise him
with his favorite dishes.

257
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,410
And Ma, can you make

258
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,787
kare-kare (oxtail stew in peanut sauce)?

259
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,956
John loves your recipe.

260
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,917
Maybe you can cook that for him.

261
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,836
It'll be your birthday gift.

262
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,254
I'm sure he'll like it.

263
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,425
"John, John, John."

264
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,676
It's always John.

265
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:46,932
Where is the
highest-rated culinary student

266
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,603
that international restaurants
are dying to have?

267
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,354
Have you seen her?

268
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,274
Tell her maybe it's time for some,

269
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,526
"Mary, Mary, Mary."

270
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,240
If you keep being like this,
you'll ruin your plan.

271
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,410
Actually,

272
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,788
I have yet to talk to John about it.

273
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,749
You still haven't told him?

274
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,210
What's taking you so long?

275
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,174
Don't tell me
you're having second thoughts?

276
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:25,596
Honey, please think about yourself too.

277
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,601
- [host on mic] Goodness, Boss Hermie!

Yes, I can. How about the cake?

00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,973
Fuck tomorrow!

362
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,767
I want to know now!

363
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,810
My question's really simple, boss.

364
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:42,770
Godfather?

365
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:43,854
[chuckles]

366
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,606
Don't you curse at me.

367
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:48,525
Just because we're close
and you're my godson

368
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:49,985
doesn't mean you can disrespect me.

369
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,071
You know why I didn't promote you?

370
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:55,199
Because of your attitude.

371
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:58,077
You're too hot-headed. You're arrogant.

372
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,330
What are you going to do
with China and Korea?

373
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,707
Flaunt your fragile ego?

374
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:06,835
Is that so?

375
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,797
That's how you see me?

376
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,756
[scoffs]

377
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,216
Really, huh?

378
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:17,346
So is that the reason why
you chose that dumb, shallow,

379
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,223
good-for-nothing girl?!

380
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,432
[scoffs]

381
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,893
Who does she think she is?!

382
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,604
You never gave her a chance.

383
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,356
She's good! Just like you!

384
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:28,982
Wow!

385
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,527
Boss, I…

386
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,987
I can't believe what you're saying.

387
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,824
I mean, you of all people
are seriously telling me that?

388
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,951
After what I've done for the company?

389
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,452
Come on!

390
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,453
Boss!

391
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,664
I think you should rest.

392
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:46,125
Ugh! Bullshit! I resign!

393
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,669
You know me, John.

394
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,881
I'm not one to beg people
who walk out on me.

395
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,552
But since we have a relationship,

396
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,346
I'll pretend I did not hear it.

397
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:00,973
Nobody heard it!

398
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,016
So you can take it back,

399
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,018
and keep your ego intact.

400
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:16,113
[morose music playing]

401
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,206
- I'm so…
- [toilet flushes]

402
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,126
[Lucio] Sorry, sorry!

403
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,503
Sir, boss!

404
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,590
Let's talk about this first!

405
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,012
I'm sorry but that's my decision.

406
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,183
[Lucio] Sir!

407
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,268
[door closes]

408
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,186
Boss.

409
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,109
[morose music playing]

410
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,653
[breathes deeply]

411
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,616
Fuck!

412
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,617
Shit!

413
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,453
- [boxes clattering]
- Fu…

414
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,539
[John] I did everything for this company!

415
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,124
- [clattering]
- [grunts]

416
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,084
Fuck!

417
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,880
[clattering]

418
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,424
[exhales deeply]

419
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:22,888
[morose music continues]

420
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,014
[clatters]

421
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:29,853
- [morose music continues]
- [clattering]

422
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:30,812
Hey.

423
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,734
Someone told me you needed a refill.

424
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:41,615
And besides…

425
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,246
This is a top-up, right?

426
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,710
To your success.

427
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:02,177
[clattering]

428
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,011
[grunts]

429
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,429
[John] Excuse me.

430
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,060
[phone chimes as video starts]

431
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,395
[Vivian] So, I was wondering,

432
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,482
are you mad at me 'cause I stole your job?

433
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,278
Or because I stole your father?

434
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,448
What are you talking about?

435
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,158
[scoffs]

436
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,493
Come on, John!

437
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:29,371
I had you figured out from day one.

438
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,125
But believe it or not,

439
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,086
I thought it was going to be you.

440
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,339
You're my idol,

441
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,841
didn't you know?

442
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,926
My angry idol.

443
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:47,848
So tell me,

444
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,104
did I beat my idol at his own game?

445
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,065
[smooches]

446
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:57,983
Oh.

447
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:03,613
[stirring music playing]

448
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,656
[gasps]

449
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,659
Goodbye kiss.

450
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,171
Sir John. Sir John!

451
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:20,881
Relax.

452
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:23,633
Don't make hasty decisions.

453
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,969
- Let's just drink.
- [elevator dings]

454
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,387
- Not now.
- [stirring music continues]

455
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,681
[glass shatters]

456
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,693
NESTOR STORE

457
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,488
[phone ringing]

458
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,491
MY SON

459
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,285
Hello, John?

460
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,206
Son?

461
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,878
[call ends, busy tone]

462
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,132
[door closes]

463
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:12,474
[morose music playing]

464
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:20,357
[Austin] Lodz, do You think Mom
and Dad are still happy?

465
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,402
I want them to be happy forever and ever.

466
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:27,864
I don't want to see my mom sad every day.

467
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:29,282
Aus!

468
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,200
[knocking]

469
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,622
You're still up.

470
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,165
Are you playing games?

471
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,167
Daddy, no.

472
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,794
I was waiting for you.

473
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,963
Because He said you were coming.

474
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,422
"He"?

475
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:45,757
Who?

476
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,134
Lodz.

477
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:48,552
Lodz?

478
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:49,511
Lodz.

479
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,512
Lodz, as in Lord.

480
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,346
That's Him.

481
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,640
[John] Where did you get this?

482
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:56,726
It was Ningning's Christmas gift
to me, remember?

483
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,270
You know what, Dad?

484
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:01,106
I asked Lodz to make your wish come true.

485
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,524
And what did He say?

486
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,985
He said, "Sure, Austin.
It will come true".

487
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,487
Well, your Lodz is a liar.

488
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,031
My wish didn't come true.

489
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,200
He said you should wait.

490
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,660
It will come true.

491
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:16,955
You just don't know
what your real wish is.

492
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,082
[John scoffs]
Of course I know my own wish!

493
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,375
You're funny.

494
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:21,543
[scoffs]

495
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,545
You know what, it's past your bedtime.

496
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:24,713
Go to sleep.

497
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,381
[smooches]

498
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:27,591
Aus.

499
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,009
Where are you taking Lodz?

500
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,553
I'm taking Him out so you can sleep.

501
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:40,687
Austin.

502
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,399
I'm sorry.

503
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,985
We haven't been bonding lately.

504
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:56,244
Daddy's been busy with work
these past few weeks.

505
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,623
Well, months.

506
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:01,374
Dad,

507
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,752
past few years.

508
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,880
Ever since I didn't make it
onto the football team,

509
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:09,633
you did not like me anymore.

510
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,635
Of course I do.

511
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,846
Don't say that, okay?

512
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,308
That's not true, all right?

513
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:22,062
Dad, I know that you're not proud of me.

514
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,313
But Lodz said that

515
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:27,275
tomorrow, you'll be proud of me.

516
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,449
Why do you look at me like that, Dad?

517
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:38,245
I'm telling you,
me and Lodz are very close.

518
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,623
All right.

519
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,084
Okay.

520
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,296
Fine.

521
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,092
Now go to sleep.

522
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,054
[smooches]

523

- [soft music playing]
- [John murmuring indistinctly]

524
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,395
- [Austin] Dad.
- Yes?

525
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,147
Lodz told me

526
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,858
that you should talk to Grandpa Nestor.

527
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:11,278
Stop hanging up after the first ring.

528
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,906
Good night, Dad.

529
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:22,956
[soft music continues]

530
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,050
[birds chirping]

[soft music continues]

532
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,021
Hon?

533
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,113
I know you're sad.

534
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,908
I know how much you wanted that promotion.

535
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,661
But who knows, right?

536
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,580
Maybe Boss Hermie has another…

537
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,665
Wait, how did you know?

538
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:08,418
Huh?

539
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,379
How did you know?

540
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:13,631
Who told you?

541
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:17,677
It's Hannah, isn't it?

542
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,764
She told you what happened?

543
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,183
- So nosy!
- Hon,

544
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,267
don't get mad at Hannah.

545
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,852
Let me handle this, give me a sec.

546
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:26,728
Hon, the truth is…

547
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,396
- I just want to…
- Wait!

548
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,066
[John clicks tongue]

549
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:35,070
[keypad typing]

550
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,321
Such a gossipmonger!

551
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,322
- Bitch.
- Hon?

552
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:43,119
It's fine. You'll get
plenty of other chances.

553
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:44,662
Maybe next time…

554
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,373
Mary, please.

555
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,291
Can we not talk about it?

556
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:49,876
Please.

557
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:55,048
[line ringing]

558
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,966
It's Austin's big day.

559
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,428
He'll leave early with Hannah.
We can go a little later.

560
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:02,430
Fine!

561
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,515
Okay! I'll get ready!

562
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,228
[door slams]

563
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,240
You're wearing that?

564
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:24,994
Yes. Why?

565
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,621
Wear something else.

566
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:28,540
You look like you're going to a wake.

567
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,917
Did you forget?

568
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,169
You bought this when you went abroad.

569
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,296
I'll change now.

570
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,048
John,

571
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,550
I'm just wondering…

572
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,595
Your birthday is coming up.

573
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,643
Do you want to

574
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,063
invite your father?

575
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,899
What?

576
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,484
Are you serious?

577
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,944
You're inviting him?

578
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:00,321
It's just a suggestion.
Don't invite him if you don't want to.

579
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,906
We've already talked about this!

580
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,868
He's dead to me.

581
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,786
Ever since he left me and my mom.

582
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,164
I just want you two to reconcile.

583
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,916
- What for?
- For your son, Austin.

584
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,752
I don't want him to grow up seeing…

585
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:14,669
Seeing what?

586
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,256
That his father
doesn't know how to forgive.

587
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,801
I don't want him to be as relentless

588
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,595
if you do something wrong someday.

589
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,847
[scoffs] Whatever.

590
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,098
Bullshit.

591
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,391
[door slams]

592
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,185
[breathes heavily]

593
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,605
[clangs]

594
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,361
[engine revving]

595
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,614
[John] What time is the program?

596
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,533
[Mary] 2:00 p.m.

597
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:05,428
I've been meaning
to tell you something, John.

598
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,905
I should've told you this long ago.

599
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:35,416
What's this?

600
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,710
Aren't these things from your office?

601
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:38,628
I resigned.

602
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,465
Boss played me.

603
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,217
Fuck him!

604
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,595
You resigned because
you didn't get the promotion?

605
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,222
Correction.

606
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,307
I resigned because they didn't promote me.

607
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,851
Those are two different things.

608
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,980
[Mary] John, are you for real?
You let your anger consume you!

609
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,022
[John] Of course I'm angry!

610
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,233
Didn't you think about me and your son?

611
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:02,360
You always let your emotions
get the best of you.

612
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:03,820
You only think about yourself!

613
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,280
What are you talking about?!

614
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,949
I always think of you and Austin!

615
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,451
You know what this promotion
can do for our family.

616
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,412
He gave me false hope.

617
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:13,997
I did everything for them!

618
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,623
And then he promoted that…

619
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,167
- bimbo who knows nothing!
- [phone ringing]

620
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,335
Come on!

621
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,546
- That promotion belongs to me.
- Hello? Hannah?

622
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,506
- Then he gave it to that bitch…
- I'll send you a video.

623
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,466
Huh? You're sending me a video?

624
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,551
- Put the phone down!
- Stop it!

625
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:28,177
- We're talking!
- Stop it!

626
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,305
What are you doing?!

627
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,181
We're talking!

628
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:34,017
- [Mary] Stop it!
- [John] Just put the phone down!

629
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,476
- [John] Stop it!
- [Mary] Wait!

630
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,396
- What are you doing?!
- [John] I said put it down!

631
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,608
That's nothing. Don't watch that.

632
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:43,902
It doesn't mean anything.

633
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,946
I don't know why she came to me.

634
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,908
Do not mind that video.

635
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,285
- [John] I was just working…
- [morose music playing]

636
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:55,455
…when she barged in.

637
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,373
Trust me.

638
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:00,293
Don't believe that video.

639
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:01,127
That's nothing!

640
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,004
We were drunk.

641
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,840
That doesn't mean anything, okay?

642
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,176
Motherfucker.

643
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:12,555

647
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,206
[John] Believe me, Mary.

648
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,290
Let me get out.

649
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,416
No. Wait.

650
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,793
Hon! Hon, please, no!

651
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,252
- Mary, no, no.
- I said let me get out!

652
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,879
No! Listen to me!
I wouldn't do that to you!

653
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,255
- I said let me get out!
- Mary! Wait.

654
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,007
No! Listen to me!

655
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,927
I wouldn't do that to you!

656
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,971
I love you and Austin!

657
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,391

Do you really love me?

Mary.

662
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,616

Sir, sit first.

00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,267
[Lucio] Sir, take a seat.

734
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,227
Let me hold this for you.

736
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,857
[Lucio] I'll get you some water.

Hannah,

738
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:40,776

740
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,579
[Aurora] You kept saying sorry earlier.

741
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:56,792
If only a "sorry" could bring Mary back.

742
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,216
Am I too harsh?

743
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,348
Sorry, not sorry.

744
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,440
Just so you know,

745
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:24,653
Mary thought of you to the very end.

746
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:28,949
She was so busy preparing
for your birthday party

747
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,701
before she died.

748
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,917
I wish she'd just used
that time to take care of…

749
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,129
Of?

750
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,008
Take care of what?

751
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:53,724
Never mind.

00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:56,811

Yes, why?

770
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:19,935
Wear something else.

777
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,733
Austin will stay with me
for a while, okay?

Why?

Dad.

I don't want to end up like Mom…

789
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,979
I think it's best
to let Austin stay with me.

790
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,772
It's hard for a kid to mourn,

791
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:48,691
and not have someone to talk to.

792
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,237
Also, he can't see you
like this all the time.

793

Dad,

794
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,244
I'll leave Lodz to you, okay?

Always pray to Him.

796

that He wants to be friends with you.

That's the one!

that made me fall for you.

You wanna drink?

Okay. Come with me.

Drink!

Now you don't want to drink?

819
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:31,960
You keep making promises to the kid.

820

And yet you can't keep them.

Oi!

00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:39,134
You disappointed another human being.

giving people false hope.

Huh?

You disappoint me.

828

I used to believe in You.

829
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:59,488
Yeah. I even prayed to You.

I think you've had too much.

I'll just come back.

Lodz.

00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,440
Shit, I was just talking to Lodz!

856
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:17,524
I thought you were Lodz.

You called me Lodz.

Kids also call me Lodz.

862
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:30,954
They said it's because
I make bulbs light up.

863
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,832
But my real name is Jess.

Nice to meet you, sir.

00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,837
I'm an electrician at Austin's school.

866
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:43,550
I came here because
your wife commissioned me

867
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,594
to fix the lights in your house.

868
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:48,931
She said it's for your birthday next week.

Why celebrate my birthday
if she's not here?

00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:04,821
Right?

873
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:06,615
[John] So what are you doing here?

875
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:08,450
Right.

00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:10,536
I'm sorry.

877

I'm slow sometimes.

878
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:15,332
Okay, I'll be leaving then.
It seems I'm no longer needed here.

879
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:17,834
No, no, no.

880
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:19,086
Stay here.

- Both.

- Lodi Boy.
- Sure.

Stay.

Come, sit down.

Hey. Wait here.

00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,311
Okay?

I want…

I want to see…

Can you do that?

911

Can you give me that?

912
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:36,997
Of course you can't.

Silly!

If I were God,

00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,420
I'd thank you for offering me a drink

916
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:45,631
instead of flowers and candles.

917
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:47,924
But if I were God,

918
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:49,801
I would not bring your wife back.

919
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,264
Agree.

920
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:58,226
Who am I to Him anyway?

921
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,022
So dramatic.

922
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,066
It's not like that.

923
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:07,653
You are important to me, Sir John.

924
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:11,990
But if I grant all of your wishes,
you will not learn anything.

925
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,785
People won't even bother
to make things right.

926
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:15,702
Yeah?

927
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:17,996
I will give you something else.

928
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,916
Really? What?

929
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,418
What will you give me?

930
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:24,586
Another day

931
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:28,131
to correct your mistakes.

932
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:32,302
I will take you back
to the day before the accident.

933
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:33,428
Do you like that?

934
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:36,556
But…

935
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,225
if I do that,

936
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,643
there's a catch.

937
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:41,228
What?

938
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,775
Someone has to die that day, John.

939
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:49,861
Now, if you're able to fix everything,

940
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:52,030
and save Mary,

941
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:53,532
you will have to choose.

942
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:57,160
Who will die in Mary's place?

943
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:58,036
[laughs]

944
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:58,954
What?

945
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:00,747
Are you serious?

946
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,250
Mm.

947
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:04,751
Oh, seriously?

948
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,336
Someone has to die.

949
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:13,051
Why does someone have…

950
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,681
Can nobody die?

951
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:21,935
- You said you're Lodz.
- [exhales loudly]

952
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:24,229
Then you have the power
to remove that condition.

953
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:26,648
Nobody dies so everybody will be happy.

954
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,068
John,

955
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,531
listen to me carefully, okay?

956
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:39,369
Your mother.

957
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,205
You know why I didn't let your mother live

958
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,499
even though you were so angry at me?

959
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:48,295
Because her mission on earth is done.

960
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:52,090
And she's done with the suffering, John.

961
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:54,718
And you,

962
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:58,805
you became strong and amazing

963
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,807
because your mother died.

964
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:05,937
Her death became your inspiration, John.

965
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:09,107
You wouldn't be who you are now
if that hadn't happened to you.

966
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:14,905
Shit.

967
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,866
How did you know that?

968
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:19,951
I told you. I'm Lodz.

969
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:22,496
So,

970
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:24,706
who are we replacing Mary with?

971
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:30,670
Austin?

972
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:31,588
Are you an idiot?

973
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:32,506
Of course not!

974
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:35,175
What do you fucking mean by Austin?

975
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:37,344
Are you cursing me?

976
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:39,346
Be warned.

977
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,347
That's bad.

978
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,063
What about…

979
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:51,817
the corrupt officials?

980
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:52,818
Someone like…

981
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:55,111
Stop right there.

982
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,530
I know what you're going to say.

983
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:57,447
Not now.

984
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:01,243
They still have to pay for their crimes.

985
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:03,203
Leave it to me.

986
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:05,038
I have many plans for them.

987
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,333
[exhales loudly]

988
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:21,221
[clock ticking]

989
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:22,681
Lodz, this…

990
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:23,723
[clears throat]

991
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,309
[clock ticking continues]

992
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:27,769
Seriously…

993
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:34,943
[clock ticking continues]

994
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:36,319
Then why not…

995
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:39,573
me.

996
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:40,490
You?

997
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,162
I'm willing.

998
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:50,292
I'm willing…

999
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:54,212
I'm willing to die that day as long as…

1000
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:01,177
As long as you save my wife.

1001
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:02,220
Can you do that?

1002
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:04,806
So, it's a deal?

1003
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,851
You have to be sure.

1004
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:15,609
[pensive music playing]

1005
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:16,484
[exhales deeply]

1006
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:17,944
Do we have a deal?

1007
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,362
I'm getting sober.

1008
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:26,411
[pensive music continues]

1009
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:32,459
Deal.

1010
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:35,503
[glasses clink]

1011
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:41,718
[fast rewinding sound]

1012
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:51,937
- [gasps]
- [cheering]

1013
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,719
Fuck.

1014
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:26,554
Shit.

1015
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:33,019
[muffled cheering]

1016
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:39,526
[Hannah] Let's give our best!

1017
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,277
We need to win!

1018
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:43,613
Sir Lucio, where is Sir John?

1019
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,407
Guys, focus.

1020
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:46,950
Wait.

1021
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:49,703
I'll call our star performer.

1022
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:52,330
[cheering, applauding]

1023
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:53,581
Sir?

1024
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,583
I think you partied too early.

1025
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:57,002
[MC] …Ms. Vivian Pastrana!

1026
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,586
- Huh?
- Lucio.

1027
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,005
Ouch! What's wrong?

1028
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:02,132
- Where are we right now?
- [Lucio] Eh? Ah…

1029
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:03,383
At the office.

1030
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:04,926
At boss' birthday party.

1031
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,136
Right?

1032
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:07,429
Today's his birthday party, right?

1033
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:08,263
Yes,

1034
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:09,764
that's why we're here.

1035
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:12,892
Fuck! He made it happen.

1036
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:13,852
What?

1037
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:15,895
This happened already.

1038
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,606
This already happened!

1039
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:19,733
Deja vu! It's called…

1040
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,943
It's not déjà vu!

1041
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,236
It's like a rewind. I went…

1042
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:25,447
I went back. I went back to
the day before Mary died.

1043
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:26,781
- Died?!
- Yes!

1044
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:27,866
Mary died?

1045
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,409
But that's not happening anymore.

1046
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:31,411
Because I will save her.

1047
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:33,371
This is amazing!

1048
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:35,248
Listen to me, man.

1049
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,543
I asked Lodz to bring me back to this day…

1050
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:40,754
- Who's Lodz?!
- …and then he can take my life.

1051
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,088
- Lodz?
- Yes! Lodz!

1052
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,298
Who's Lodz?

1053
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:44,299
He's Jesus Christ.

1054
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:46,509
- Lodz! Oh my God, I know him!
- Yes, that's Him!

1055
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:47,427
I told him,

1056
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:48,803
Lodz, take me back to that day

1057
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:51,181
- and then take my life.
- What did he say?

1058
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:52,474
- Really?
- That can't happen but…

1059
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:53,975
- That's what Lodz said?
- Here's what we'll do…

1060
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:56,644
Sorry, sir.

1061
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,605
Believe me!

1062
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,482
Do I look like I'm lying?

1063
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:02,400
I really talked to Lodz.

1064
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:03,651
Oops! Didn't mean it!

1065
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,695
Sorry, sir. Forgive me.

1066
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,531
But are you just making excuses

1067
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:10,909
because you don't want
to do the performance?

1068
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:14,120
Sorry.

1069
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,623
We're next, right?

1070
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,541
We're going to perform next, right?

1071
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:19,626
Yes.

1072
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:20,919
Something's going to happen.

1073
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:21,878
What's going to happen?

1074
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:23,713
You will have a wardrobe malfunction,

1075
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,131
and everybody will see your briefs.

1076
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:26,841
They're red.

1077
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:29,135
[scoffing chuckle]

1078
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,095
Let's go!

1079
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:39,187
- The next performers really came prepared.
- One, two, three, go sales!

1080
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:43,566
Our all-male National Sales
headed by Mr. John Lamiro Nuñez

1081
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,903
in this spine-tingling dance performance!

1082
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:49,572
[cheering]

1083
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:50,824
Boss, I love you!

1084
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:57,831
- Go, Sir John.
- ["Amakabogera" playing]

1085
00:56:58,581 --> 00:56:59,874
[woman cheering]

1086
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:01,626
[grunts]

1087
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:05,964
- [Hannah] Go, Sir John!
- [John] Oh! Oh! Oh!

1088
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,175
[woman cheering]

1089
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,220
[laughter]

1090
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:14,180
[Hannah] Sir, keep shaking that booty!

1091
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:17,142
- [Lucio] Hoo! Hoo!
- [Hannah] That's my boss!

1092
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:19,978
[Lucio] Ha! Ha! Ha!

1093
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:21,813
[Hannah] You can do it, boss!

1094
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:26,276
[Hannah] Go, sir!

1095
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:28,069
- [Lucio] Yeah! Whoo!
- [Hannah] Go! Sir John!

1096
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:29,779
- [Hannah] Go, sir!
- [Lucio grunting]

1097
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:32,824
Let me show you how!

1098
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:36,744
Oh!

1099
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:39,622
- [laughter]

01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:06,543
[Mary] Like that?!

1462
01:15:06,627 --> 01:15:13,634
[soft music playing]

1463
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:24,603
You've been acting weird since last night.

1464
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:25,521
What's up?

1465
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:28,065
Huh?

1466
01:15:31,151 --> 01:15:32,069
It's nothing.

1467
01:15:38,742 --> 01:15:40,577
I'll get something downstairs.

1468
01:15:40,661 --> 01:15:42,120
My gift for Austin.

1469
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:44,331
Come down when you're done.

1470
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:50,170
- [chuckles]
- [smooches]

1471
01:15:50,254 --> 01:15:55,676
[music fades]

1472
01:16:12,317 --> 01:16:14,027
[folder flipping]

1473
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:15,988
[Mary] I'm ready!

1474
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:17,364
Let's go!

1475
01:16:17,447 --> 01:16:18,282
Hon?

1476
01:16:24,454 --> 01:16:25,414
What's this?

1477
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:32,212
How long have you been
planning to do this?

1478
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:36,174
You're leaving?

1479
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:41,471
You're going to leave me?

1480
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,277
It's been there for some weeks.

1481
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:59,781
I thought of telling you
after your birthday.

1482
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:04,870
Asian Culinary Institute in Singapore?

1483
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:08,790
Austin got accepted at the…

1484
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:12,711
Singapore Academy of Music.

1485
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:14,921
There's only four of them,

1486
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:16,965
and he's the only Filipino.

1487
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:22,262
So then I thought of looking for work too.

1488
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:25,724
And I got accepted too!

1489
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:29,770
It felt like God's gift to me.

1490
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:31,313
But you know what John…

1491
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:33,940
It feels good to know that…

1492
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:41,490
I can still do it.

1493
01:17:41,573 --> 01:17:43,075
That…

1494
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:45,494
I can still be accepted.

1495
01:17:47,871 --> 01:17:48,705
So…

1496
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:51,875
What's your plan?

1497
01:17:54,961 --> 01:17:56,546
With Austin?

1498
01:17:58,006 --> 01:17:59,466
The two of you?

1499
01:18:01,134 --> 01:18:02,010
So…

1500
01:18:03,595 --> 01:18:04,930
you're leaving me?

1501
01:18:06,264 --> 01:18:09,810
John, it's just Singapore.

1502
01:18:09,893 --> 01:18:11,436
You can always visit us.

1503
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,646
Visit?

1504
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:21,029
Why am I only hearing about this now?

1505
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:22,823
Why didn't you tell me?

1506
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:25,575
How, John?

1507
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:28,995
How was I supposed to tell you?

1508
01:18:31,665 --> 01:18:33,500
If you're not busy,

1509
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:37,129
you're thinking about work,

1510
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:38,130
you're tired.

1511
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:39,506
Or you're mad.

1512
01:18:39,589 --> 01:18:41,258
How will I tell you?

1513
01:18:41,341 --> 01:18:42,926
You surprised me.

1514
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:44,803
I didn't see this coming.

1515
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:48,974
John, I'm not blind.

1516
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:54,271
I know that everyone around me thinks,

1517
01:18:55,021 --> 01:18:57,399
I gave my life to you.

1518
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:05,866
Sometimes I ask myself…

1519
01:19:08,827 --> 01:19:10,620
Can't we…

1520
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:15,667
both support each other?

1521
01:19:20,213 --> 01:19:22,841
Why is it that one has to push the other

1522
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:25,177
to succeed, to grow, and to fly?

1523
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:28,722
Can't we fly together?

1524
01:19:28,805 --> 01:19:30,682
You're the one who pushed me here!

1525
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:34,436
Yes, but I want to be at the top with you!

1526
01:19:36,813 --> 01:19:39,065
Sometimes, I wonder,

1527
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:41,902
what is my role as your wife?

1528
01:19:41,985 --> 01:19:42,736
To cook for you?

1529
01:19:42,819 --> 01:19:43,570
To do your laundry?

1530
01:19:43,653 --> 01:19:45,363
To look over our kid?

1531
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:48,492
John…

1532
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:54,790
I want to achieve my dreams too.

1533
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,876
You know…

1534
01:19:58,668 --> 01:20:01,838
I don't wanna be just your wife.

1535
01:20:02,422 --> 01:20:03,715
I wanna be…

1536
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:06,009
I wanna be worthy for myself.

1537
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:09,513
I want to feel whole.

1538
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:12,599
I want to feel that.

1539
01:20:12,682 --> 01:20:14,351
So, what happened last night?

1540
01:20:14,434 --> 01:20:15,519
That's just nothing to you?

1541
01:20:15,602 --> 01:20:17,312
That's just one night.

1542
01:20:18,271 --> 01:20:20,524
It won't change everything.

1543
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:31,660
[Mary sobs]

1544
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:32,577
John…

1545
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:41,211
- [morose music playing]
- [sobbing continues]

1546
01:20:41,294 --> 01:20:42,128
[phone chimes]

1547
01:20:56,142 --> 01:20:58,603
John, we have to catch Austin's program.

1548
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:01,523
We should go.

1549
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:04,901
[sobs, sniffles]

1550
01:21:08,196 --> 01:21:15,120
[unsettling music playing]

1551
01:21:22,168 --> 01:21:23,169
[objects clattering]

1552
01:21:23,253 --> 01:21:24,296
[ladder clatters]

1553
01:21:24,796 --> 01:21:25,714
[whispers] Oh my God!

1554
01:21:26,756 --> 01:21:27,591
[John] Who's that?

1555
01:21:29,134 --> 01:21:30,010
Sir,

1556
01:21:30,093 --> 01:21:31,469
- I didn't see you there.
- Who's that?!

1557
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:32,762
Sir, I'm sorry.

1558
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:34,890
- This is supposed to be…
- Lodz!

1559
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:35,849
…a surprise for you.

1560
01:21:35,932 --> 01:21:37,642
Sir, sorry, I thought you already left.

1561
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:39,853
Can you pretend you didn't see me?

1562
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:42,022
Don't make me drink today.

1563
01:21:42,105 --> 01:21:43,648
I have to climb trees. I might…

1564
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:45,775
Did you hear that?

1565
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:46,693
Sir?

1566
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:48,278
She's going to leave me!

1567
01:21:48,361 --> 01:21:49,738
What's the point of our deal?

1568
01:21:49,821 --> 01:21:50,655
She's leaving.

1569
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:51,698
She's leaving me!

1570
01:21:51,781 --> 01:21:52,532
What is this?

1571
01:21:52,616 --> 01:21:53,491
Sir?

1572
01:21:54,367 --> 01:21:55,535
What are we talking about?

1573
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:57,370
Didn't we agree

1574
01:21:57,454 --> 01:21:59,039
that I would die instead of her?!

1575
01:21:59,122 --> 01:22:01,249
What's my sacrifice for

1576
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:02,375
if she's leaving me anyway?

1577
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:03,752
This is pointless!

1578
01:22:03,835 --> 01:22:04,753
You tricked me!

1579
01:22:04,836 --> 01:22:06,963
Our deal is a scam!

1580
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:08,924
You are a scam!

1581
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:15,096
I thought you'd already
learned your lesson.

1582
01:22:15,805 --> 01:22:17,641
With just one challenge, you're giving up?

1583
01:22:19,142 --> 01:22:21,519
Is everything still the same to you, John?

1584
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:23,146
You're still selfish?

1585
01:22:23,229 --> 01:22:25,190
You still think only of yourself?

1586
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:28,193
Now that she's leaving you,
you're giving up?

1587
01:22:29,027 --> 01:22:31,655
I guess I'm still talking to
the immature John.

1588
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:33,281
Huh?

1589
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:35,158
The selfish John.

1590
01:22:35,241 --> 01:22:36,660
The greedy John.

1591
01:22:36,743 --> 01:22:39,621
The John who doesn't know what love is.

1592
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:49,631
You want to call the deal off?

1593
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:53,093
Fine, I will get her later.

1594
01:22:53,176 --> 01:22:54,970
Since she's leaving you, right?

1595
01:22:55,053 --> 01:22:56,262
No, no, no.

1596
01:22:56,346 --> 01:22:59,182
No, Lodz, that's not what I mean.

1597
01:22:59,265 --> 01:23:01,101
- No?
- No, I don't want that!

1598
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:05,146
I'm just…

1599
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:07,232
I'm just so confused because

1600
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:10,193
what we talked about is
different from what's happening.

1601
01:23:10,276 --> 01:23:11,820
You're the Lord, right? You're God?

1602
01:23:11,903 --> 01:23:15,156
You should know
what I'm feeling right now.

1603
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:16,950
Fuck! Why are you making us suffer?

1604
01:23:17,033 --> 01:23:18,702
Just tell me what's going to happen!

1605
01:23:18,785 --> 01:23:19,786
Why can't you just tell me?

1606
01:23:19,869 --> 01:23:21,413
Why are you making people suffer?

1607
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:22,872
Why can't you just tell me?

1608
01:23:22,956 --> 01:23:24,249
Why do you want me to suffer?

1609
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:26,710
Do you know how difficult this is for me?

1610
01:23:26,793 --> 01:23:27,585
Just tell me,

1611
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:28,920
John, you lost!

1612
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:29,963
- You lost!
- John!

1613
01:23:30,046 --> 01:23:30,797
- John!
- You lost!

1614
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:31,715
John!

1615
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:33,174
What are you doing?

1616
01:23:34,634 --> 01:23:35,468
Jess!

1617
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:36,845
Ma'am.

1618
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:38,471
John!

1619
01:23:38,555 --> 01:23:40,515
I'm sorry. My husband
didn't recognize you.

1620
01:23:40,598 --> 01:23:41,349
Are you okay?

1621
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:42,600
Yes.

1622
01:23:47,313 --> 01:23:51,234
Didn't I tell you to put up
the lights once we're gone?

1623
01:23:51,317 --> 01:23:52,652
I'm sorry.

1624
01:23:52,736 --> 01:23:54,529
I thought you already left.

1625
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:56,573
But it's okay.

1626
01:23:56,656 --> 01:23:58,199
This is nothing.

1627
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:01,119
Sir John was just asking…

1628
01:24:01,202 --> 01:24:03,455
What do we do if we can't find the light?

1629
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:04,914
What?!

1630
01:24:09,169 --> 01:24:10,670
John, we should go.

1631
01:24:15,133 --> 01:24:15,967
John.

1632
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:21,890
Sir.

1633
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:28,563
Just tell the Lord what your decision is.

1634
01:24:28,646 --> 01:24:30,273
Time's running out.

1635
01:24:32,692 --> 01:24:33,526
Bye, sir.

1636
01:24:34,027 --> 01:24:34,861
Take care.

1637
01:24:43,453 --> 01:24:47,499
[engine revving]

1638
01:24:57,383 --> 01:25:00,929
[watch ticking]

1639
01:25:01,012 --> 01:25:05,475
- [exhales deeply]
- [watch ticking]

1640
01:25:17,695 --> 01:25:19,864
Okay, I take it back!

1641
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:21,032
Fine!

1642
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:22,200
I'm taking it back!

You're here.

1725

1728

but I think this looks better on you.

1730
01:29:03,546 --> 01:29:04,964
It's heavy.

1731
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:06,841
Just wear it later.

1732
01:29:06,924 --> 01:29:08,384
Dad, no, no, no.

1733
01:29:08,468 --> 01:29:11,095
I'll put it on top of the piano.

Forgive your Papa Dragon.

He's very busy 'cause he's the king.

1771
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:25,062

- Psst.

Do you know that Mary
will live a good life?

1828
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:05,968
She'll own a restaurant

1829
01:36:06,051 --> 01:36:09,013
that will help a lot of employees, John.

1830
01:36:11,348 --> 01:36:12,641
And Austin?

1831
01:36:13,184 --> 01:36:16,020
He'll grow up to be
a great and successful pianist.

1832
01:36:16,562 --> 01:36:18,439
He'll have numerous concerts.

1833
01:36:19,064 --> 01:36:21,317
And he'll dedicate every concert
to his father.

1834
01:36:22,359 --> 01:36:26,071
They will inspire a lot of people

1835
01:36:26,155 --> 01:36:29,700
because they are inspired by you.

1836
01:36:31,827 --> 01:36:33,329
And all of that

1837
01:36:33,412 --> 01:36:35,039

I always say it's John.

John is my first love.

And I know in my heart

1889
01:42:42,281 --> 01:42:44,491
that he will also be the last.

1890
01:42:48,912 --> 01:42:51,290
John used to tell me

1891
01:42:52,374 --> 01:42:55,586
that if you make a wish

1892
01:42:55,669 --> 01:42:57,963
while looking at heaven,

1893
01:42:58,046 --> 01:43:00,007
it will surely come true.

1894

Before, whenever I looked at heaven,

1895
01:43:04,761 --> 01:43:06,638
I always wished

1896
01:43:07,723 --> 01:43:09,391
for John to be happy

1897
01:43:11,059 --> 01:43:13,729
because I hated seeing him sad.

But now, that wish has changed.

Now, I wish to not be sad anymore.
