Of course, they won't do it directly.

If you want to show off in front of her,

108

They've been single for a long time.

114

Besides, your cousin is a true beauty.

116

She's not my cousin.

117
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,290

Those guards don't know their place.

121
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,670
Please don't take it to heart.

122
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,210
In what way do they not know their place?

123
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,620
Anyway...

124
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:35,880
Anyway, they don't have bad intentions.

125
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,030
They just want to seem...

126
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,140
You could tell?

127
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,230
Of course.

128
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,560
I have more experience than you

130
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:50,700

131
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,650
Are you afraid that I'll fall for them

132
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,120
and abandon you?

133
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,250
You think too much.

134
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,210
I'm afraid they'll anger you

135
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,870
and you'll want to kill again.

136

00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,270
We're in the same field, after all.

I can't easily pay thousands of gold to buy someone's life.

154
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,870
It was just Zhao Ji who was greedy.

155
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,950
We usually live a frugal life.

156
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,750
Sometimes, we don't even have money to buy horses.

157
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,960
The higher-ups

on one hand.

160
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,410
On the other hand, they hope we can be like immortals

161
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,390
and go without eating.

162
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,830
You're like this too?

163
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,050
When I was in office,

164
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,610
asking the higher-ups for a bonus

165
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,030
took more effort than killing.

166
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,010
Exactly.

167
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,370
When Shisan and the others come back,

168
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,130
would you like to discuss the next steps

169
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,090
with us?

170
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,630
Do you all trust me?

171
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:03,930
Of course.

172
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,100
I told you.

173
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,270
You are a companion.

174
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,810
But I'm not trying to flatter you.

175
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,690
It's just that Prince Danyang has too many men this time.

176
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,650
We must work together.

177
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,410
Call me then.

178
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,990
Laugh if you want. Don't hold it in.

179
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,010
You can laugh at me,

180
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,570
but don't be disrespectful

181
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,690
to Miss Ruyi,

182
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:38,760
understand?

183
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,010
Yes.

184
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,350
I disguised myself as a musician and sneaked into Zhou Jian's office.

185
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,490
He happened to be talking about this with his men.

186
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:10,950
He said

187
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,390
that this time,

188
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,790
he definitely won't let us out of the Tushan Pass alive.

189
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,130
This is the place.

190
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,030
The delegation must pass by here.

191
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,050
Then we won't take the official road.

192
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,830
We'll take the small mountain path.

193
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,010
No.

194
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,750
Even if we can cross it,

195
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,970
Her Highness's carriage can't.

196
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,050
Besides, we still have the gold.

197
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,890
Even if we pull them up cart by cart,

198
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,030
we'll still attract

199
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,420
their attention if the commotion is too big.

200
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:34,530
What if we force our way through?

201
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,870
They've arranged 1,000 men to be in Tushan Pass

202
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,080
and all kinds of experts.

203
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,550
How many of us are there?

204
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:41,780
Force our way through?

205
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,050
What do you think?

206
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,250
Kill.

207
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,170
Catch the leader first.

208
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,790
As long as we kill Zhou Jian

209
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:56,970
and make it sudden,

210
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,380
the 1,000 guards will no longer pose a threat.

211
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,250
How can we kill him?

212
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:02,950
I'll do it.

213
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,330
When do you want him to die?

214
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,690
That's straightforward.

215
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,850
How much has your internal force recovered?

216
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,060
About half.

217
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,070
That won't do.

218
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,030
Zhou Jian was third in the martial arts imperial examination.

219
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,460
Even if you happen to succeed,

220
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,830
you won't be able to leave unscathed.

221
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:19,750
He has been famous for a long time.

222
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,730
I've read his file before.

223
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:22,710
I've calculated

224
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,730
that I can kill him

225
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,360
and at most cripple my own arm.

226
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,120
Even if Zhou Jian is dead,

227
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,320
his soldiers will still be guarding Tushan Pass.

228
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,000
We will still have to break in.

229
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,910
The people in the delegation are not weak.

230
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,110
The loss will be too big.

231
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,970
This won't do, that won't do.

232
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,010
Then why did you call me here?

233
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,580
In our field,

234
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,880
isn't it necessary

235
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,160
to risk our lives every day?

236
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:49,950
It's not that we can't take the risk,

237
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,290
but we can't take risks too casually.

238
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,890
We must maximize our possibility of winning.

239
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:54,820
How about this?

240
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,790
Tell me

241
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,810
the contents you've read in Zhou Jian's file

242
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,030
so that I can compare it with his file in the Liudao Hall.

243
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,210
I only remember that he's in his forties.

244
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,100
He's straightforward and loves drinking.

245
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,080
He usually doesn't sleep alone.

246
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,200
He's not very well-read,

247
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,790
but he likes reading novels of famous generals.

248
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:19,070
He claims to be the 20th grandson of General Zhou of the previous dynasty.

249
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,090
Shisan,

250
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,420
are you sure

251
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,400
he doesn't know that the Liudao Hall is escorting the princess?

252
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,630
I don't think he knows.

253
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:32,720
Why not?

254
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,600
We haven't gone to the posthouse.

255
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,250
I've also talked to the posthouse manager.

256
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,110
They

257
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,870
still think we haven't reached Tushan Pass yet.

258
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,530
His staff also said

259
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,330
that they think

260
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,040
we only have around 20 guards.

261
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,710
If they kill us, half of the 100,000 taels of gold

262
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,020
would be given to Prince Danyang,

263
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,950
while they'd be able to keep the other half.

264
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,410
In that case,

265
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,170
we might as well use our wisdom to outsmart him.

266
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,380
Zhou Jian is exposed, while we're still hidden.

267
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,920
-As long as...
-You all can keep discussing it.

268
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,510
It's Yang Ying's bedtime.

269
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,810
I should go too.

270
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,480
Boss, is Ruyi angry?

271
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,050
She's not angry.

272
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,410
She's just not used to

273
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,810
discussing things with so many people.

274
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,390
She was an assassin.

275
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,790
She's used to being alone.

276
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,320
You seem to know her well.

277
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,250
Let's get down to business.

278
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,180
Alright, I support using wisdom.

279
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,990
We can...

280
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,410
Pearl birds are more sensitive to poisonous smoke than humans.

281
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:39,990
If someone releases poisonous smoke,

282
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,990
it will start screaming.

283
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:43,890
Interesting.

284
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,370
If you hang the bell on the window,

285
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,150
it will ring if an assassin touches it.

286
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,190
Got it.

287
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,120
How dare you!

288
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:55,730
I'm not a princess.

289
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,660
I am...

290
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,230
Prince Li.

291
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,790
I made a mistake.

292
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,110
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

293
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,690
Ms. Ren,

294
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,600
I can't sleep alone.

295
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,860
I order you now to accompany me.

296
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,090
How would you like me

297
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,070
to accompany you?

298
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,520
The Scarlet Guards

299
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:47,410
usually offer beautiful girls and boys to envoys

300
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,090
to investigate them.

301
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,170
If you don't want to expose yourself,

302
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,980
you must learn to face it calmly.

303
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,250
Okay.

304
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,620
How should I act calm?

305
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,120
First, frown.

306
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,050
Second,

307
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:15,900
don't move.

308
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,240
Third,

309
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,680
just softly say two phrases.

310
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,230
Dirty.

311
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:26,370
Get out.

312
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,870
Dirty. Get out.

313
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,470
Forgive me, Your Highness,

314
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:38,380
but I really have nowhere to go.

315
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,830
Please pity me.

316
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,020
How rude!

317
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,480
Guards! Drag her out!

318
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,590
Was that right?

319
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:53,790
Not bad.

320
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,360
You're smart.

321
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,190
Really?

322
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,400
But Ruyi,

323
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,490
why do you know so many things?

324
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,870
If only I were half pretty and capable as you,

325
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,250
that would be great.

326
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:06,569
I had to learn it too.

327
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,119
I would've died if I couldn't learn it well.

328
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:10,750
You too.

329
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,490
I'm not afraid.

330
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,560
These days, I can see

331
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,060
that you and Yuanzhou

332
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,109
both speak fiercely,

333
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,180
but you just want to scare me.

334
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:21,829
Yang Ying,

335
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,690
you must remember

336
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,079
that emotions like true love

337
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,660
have long died in Ning Yuanzhou and I.

338
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,200
Maybe

339
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,560
he had some feelings for you

340
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,930
when he was a guard in the palace,

341
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,290
but if you still can't come to your senses one day,

342
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,070
he will really kill you.

343
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,810
Just like now,

344
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,510
I can joke with you

345
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,700
and kill you at the same time.

346
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,360
Don't trust anyone,

347
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,530
no matter how good he is to you.

348
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,080
The only one who will never betray you

349
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,730
is yourself.

350
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,010
This

351
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,620
is the most important thing I will teach you.

352
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,650
Got it?

353
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:17,340
Go to sleep.

354
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:27,150
Your Highness.

355
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,010
Good morning, Your Highness.

356
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,770
You didn't sleep well last night?

357
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,670
I had difficulty sleeping in the new environment.

358
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,580
Why hasn't everyone packed up?

359
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,610
When are we leaving?

360
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:41,870
We're not leaving today.

361
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,210
Boss said to stand by.

362
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,510
Where did he go?

363
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,190
He and Shisan went to persuade Zhou Jian to let us go.

364
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,670
Isn't Zhou Jian working for Brother Danyang?

365
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,960
Will he listen to Yuanzhou—

366
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,530
To Mr. Ning?

367
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,520
Use emotions and logic to persuade others.

368
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,660
It's not up to him this time.

369
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,410
He wants to kidnap Zhou Jian?

370
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,250
Is this the method you all came up with yesterday?

371
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,610
It's something more effective than kidnapping.

372
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,490
Ruyi,

373
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,120
just wait and see.

374
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,810
[Zhou Jian, Prince Danyang's trusted patrol cavalry general]

375
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,450
Why is Prince Li so slow?

376
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,130
When can they enter Tushan Town?

377
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,510
I am Ning Yuanzhou, the chief of Liudao Hall.

378
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,100
I am under Prince Danyang's orders.

379
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:29,710
Greetings, General Zhou.

380
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,050
Ning Yuanzhou?

381
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,270
Some secret things

382
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,200
are not suitable for outsiders to hear,

383
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,030
so I had to ask Advisor Zhang

384
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,280
to take a short break.

385
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,000
Two years ago,

386
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:42,870
I met you once

387
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,010
in the Duke Shen's mansion.

388
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,690
Do you still remember?

389
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:46,510
Yes.

390
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,230
But aren't you already...

391
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,740
It's all thanks to His Highness's kindness,

392
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,380
allowing me to live.

393
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,810
That's why I have the chance to serve His Highness

394
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,300
with you.

395
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,540
This decree can serve as evidence.

396
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:20,850
Hold on.

397
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,950
I need to check the seal.

398
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,450
When did His Highness send you here?

399
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,150
What day was it?

400
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,360
The 27th.

401
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:54,880
[Decree: I'm sending Ning Yuanzhou to you for Prince Li's affairs. He can be trusted.]

402
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,550
Please forgive me, Mr. Ning.

403
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,810
Don't blame me for being suspicious,

404
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,670
but a few days ago, I received a letter from the mansion,

405
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,200
ordering me to stop Prince Li.

406
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,530
I don't know why he...

407
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,610
It's just that, a few days ago, I didn't return to the capital yet

408
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:13,870
and didn't see His Highness.

409
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:15,630
Otherwise,

410
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,680
I wouldn't have let those aides

411
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,500
come up with such a stupid idea.

412
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,720
They even wanted to do it directly.

413
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,690
They didn't even think

414
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,710
that if Prince Li really died in the State of An,

415
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,870
Zhang Song and the empress would never forgive them.

416
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,070
They just need to catch a few witnesses

417
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,270
of when you took action

418
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,090
and His Highness

419
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,590
would most likely be sentenced to death for killing his brother and treason.

420
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,410
General Zhou,

421
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,990
you would also be sentenced to death.

422
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,340
Fortunately, you are prudent

423
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,260
and only set up an ambush in Tushan Pass,

424
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,910
avoiding a huge mistake.

425
00:21:59,210 --> 00:21:59,810
That's right.

426
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,050
I knew something was wrong.

427
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,070
Mr. Ning,

428
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,610
what's your plan?

429
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,020
I proposed a plan to His Highness.

430
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,560
Have you heard of the story

431
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,080
of General Zhang from the previous dynasty

432
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,130
using a scarecrow to disguise himself

433
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,010
to lure the enemy into the camp?

434
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,210
Of course.

435
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,970
General Zhou is indeed knowledgeable.

436
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:26,310
My plan is to substitute one for the other.

437
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,270
Prince Li has always been in the palace.

438
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,230
The An people naturally don't know what he looks like.

439
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,990
We just need to form a fake delegation

440
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,290
and enter the State of An before the real delegation.

441
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,890
Then, we can create some conflicts with the An people

442
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,540
and die within the State of An.

443
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,470
In this way,

444
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,460
the peace talks between the two states will fall apart.

445
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,170
Amidst the chaos,

446
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,770
no one will care where the true Prince Li is.

447
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,790
As long as His Majesty can't return,

448
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,330
the throne

449
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,750
will naturally fall into His Highness's hands.

450
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:04,290
Even if the fake delegation is exposed,

451
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,110
no one will connect it

452
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,640
to His Highness and us.

453
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,470
This is a brilliant plan.

454
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,830
It's just that the delegation is huge.

455
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,850
It's hard to find

456
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,110
so many suitable people in such a hurry.

457
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,750
Don't worry, General Zhou.

458
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,780
I've already arranged the old men of the Liudao Hall.

459
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,780
I can't say the disguise is flawless,

460
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,960
but they do look the part.

461
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:33,370
Really?

462
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,240
Yes.

463
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:38,450
[Wu]

464
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:54,950
I didn't expect

465
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,410
that your lightness skill would be so good.

466
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,890
You were silent when you came to me just now.

467
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,300
I almost fell off in shock.

468
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:01,440
What?

469
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,390
Did Yuan Lu tell you where we are?

470
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:04,680
Let's get down to business.

471
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,630
What exactly is Ning Yuanzhou planning?

472
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,210
Why did Zhou Jian believe him?

473
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:11,360
It's an amazing plan.

474
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,750
Although Ning came up with it,

475
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,100
I put in a lot of effort too.

476
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:16,490
Get to the point.

477
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,180
To make Zhou Jian trust us,

478
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,970
we need Prince Danyang's seal and secret decree.

479
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,580
I went to Zhou Jian's place yesterday

480
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,600
and stole his letters with Prince Danyang.

481
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:32,790
Try again.

482
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,820
Yuan Lu can create

483
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,800
an automatic mechanism with his eyes closed.

484
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,430
Carving an identical seal

485
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:38,590
is a piece of cake for him.

486
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,070
As for the code,

487
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,770
that's Ning's talent.

488
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,170
He has a sharp nose.

489
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,980
He smelled milk in the letter,

490
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:46,210
so he was sure

491
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,220
that the code was written with a brush dipped in milk.

492
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,810
He asked Sun Lang to catch a messenger from before.

493
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,430
I'll give you one last chance.

494
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:54,630
Will you say it or not?

495
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,120
I'll tell you.

496
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,630
After Qian interrogated him,

497
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,810
he spent an hour

498
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,960
and finally solved the code

499
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:01,920
that only becomes visible with heat.

500
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,410
Qian Zhao knows how to decode?

501
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,460
He looks annoying,

502
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,370
but

503
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,620
he knows a bit about medicine, arts, calligraphy,

504
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:13,410
and how to cheat people.

505
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,930
Was it Ning Yuanzhou who came up with

506
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,410
the idea of a deception?

507
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:21,080
The real delegation has become a fake delegation,

508
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,820
while Zhou Jian has to

509
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:24,810
respectfully guide us through the pass.

510
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:25,440
What do you think?

511
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,680
Isn't Ning smart?

512
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,380
Not really.

513
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:32,070
You could've achieved this by killing Zhou Jian,

514
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:34,200
but you had to complicate things.

515
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,230
Didn't we calculate it before?

516
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,520
If we force our way in, we'll suffer casualties.

517
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,050
Ning doesn't want any of us to get hurt,

518
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,060
so he'd rather use wisdom than force.

519
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,090
Treating your subordinates as brothers

520
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,930
is just a saying.

521
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,270
You really believe it?

522
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,650
Others don't, but you should.

523
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,010
In our work,

524
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,560
we live in danger every day.

525
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,550
We are not fools.

526
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,510
It's clear who can truly risk their lives

527
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,180
with us.

528
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,990
Ning is clever and good at martial arts,

529
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,280
but just these two points

530
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,470
aren't enough for him to become the chief.

531
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,170
When the Hungry Ghost Path's gunpowder magazine exploded back then,

532
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,670
it was Ning who rushed into the fire

533
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:16,770
and broke four ribs

534
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,160
to unearth the five-year-old Yuan Lu

535
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,840
and a group of unconscious mechanics

536
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,370
from the dust.

537
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,470
When the late emperor was poisoned by the State of Su

538
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,670
and the old chief of Hell Path committed suicide to escape punishment,

539
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:28,000
it was Ning who stepped up and accepted the order

540
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,770
to find the true murderer within ten days,

541
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:32,200
saving the lives of 500 people.

542
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,370
The Liudao Hall has more rules

543
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,100
than you police officers.

544
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,630
You can't become the Deputy Chief

545
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,040
unless you're from the top three paths.

546
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,050
What was Ning?

547
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,650
He was just a scout from the Hell Path.

548
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,590
Why was he an exception to the rule?

549
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:46,950
He was carried up there

550
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,000
by the brothers of the six paths.

551
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,670
Don't you think we count as true brothers?

552
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,090
Is this why you're all willing to go to the State of An

553
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,580
and rescue the emperor of Wu with him?

554
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:58,390
Of course.

555
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,140
Of course, it's because of you, Beauty.

556
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:03,980
Did you know?

557
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,030
He's very worried of you getting hurt.

558
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,730
When he heard that you wanted to kill Zhou Jian,

559
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,430
his heart almost leapt out of his throat.

560
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,450
Beauty, you have to trust me.

561
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,180
Really.

562
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:20,870
I am real,

563
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,130
but I have to pretend to be fake?

564
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:25,010
That's right. We'll suffer the least losses this way.

565
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:25,810
It's the safest too.

566
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,110
But...

567
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,410
Don't be afraid.

568
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:30,600
You're the fake Prince Li,

569
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,620
so it's normal for you to give yourself away.

570
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,620
It'll be fine as long as you don’t talk

571
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,170
and just act according to Ning Yuanzhou's instructions.

572
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,720
He stayed in the military office

573
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,160
to stabilize Zhou Jian.

574
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,500
He must keep talking to Zhou Jian

575
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,320
so that he doesn't have the chance

576
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,510
to discover what's wrong.

577
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:49,810
Okay.

578
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,240
What about Mr. Du?

579
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,550
He’s the chief clerk of the delegation.

580
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:55,170
What if he messes up?

581
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,070
This is the chief clerk of the delegation?

582
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:00,950
How dare you!

583
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,630
I'm a third-rank chief clerk.

584
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,920
How dare a mere patrol cavalry general

585
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,430
speak impolitely to me?

586
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,660
General Zhou.

587
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,220
This chief clerk is real.

588
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:18,470
He was taking a break at home.

589
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,930
I forged the empress's decree

590
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,250
to transfer him here as the chief clerk.

591
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,350
He thinks he's leading the real delegation.

592
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,610
We need some truth to fool the An people.

593
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:28,930
Very wise.

594
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,660
Lord, please forgive me.

595
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,850
I was busy with military affairs

596
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,150
and lacked in my manners.

597
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:39,690
Mr. Du,

598
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,020
General Zhou has arranged the whole schedule for us.

599
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,470
Please forgive him.

600
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,560
As expected of Mr. Ning.

601
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,890
As expected of the Liudao Hall.

602
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,320
In just a few days,

603
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,200
you created

604
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,270
such a decent-looking delegation.

605
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,510
Even I was almost fooled.

606
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,680
We were too rushed,

607
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,530
so we still couldn't find the best people.

608
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,230
Look at these guards.

609
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,860
Some look wooden, some are dazed,

610
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,510
and some are dumb.

611
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,420
Especially Prince Li

612
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,250
is truly not good enough.

613
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:33,390
Yes, he's a bit off.

614
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,690
Mr. Ning, you will have to

615
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,390
take the time to train them during the journey.

616
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:38,370
Don't worry.

617
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,250
General Zhou,

618
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,740
how's the arrangement at the pass?

619
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,500
I'll personally send you through.

620
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,570
I promise no one else

621
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,650
will see your true appearances, except me.

622
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,690
Thank you, General Zhou.

623
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,340
We will set off now.

624
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,140
Let's go.

625
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,390
General Zhou, you are really thoughtful.

626
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:11,510
Thank you.

627
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,630
You flatter me.

628
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,690
Those who love reading novels

629
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:17,930
are all good friends.

630
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,170
You're welcome.

631
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,870
I just received a letter from a pigeon.

632
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:25,110
The real delegation is near Sanli Posthouse.

633
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,110
I'll leave the interception to you,

634
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,370
but don't forget His Highness's instructions.

635
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,700
Just delay them.

636
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,270
Don't kill anyone.

637
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:36,910
Also,

638
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:41,090
in order to prevent bandits,

639
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,170
the real delegation has both real and fake gold.

640
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,110
The ones with real gold have the word "ten thousand"

641
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:46,370
on the horses' legs.

642
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,030
General Zhou, do as you wish.

643
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,310
Mr. Ning, you are truly wonderful.

644
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,930
I shall take my leave now.

645
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:55,590
Goodbye.

646
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,180
Go at full speed

647
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,790
and leave Peizhou as soon as possible.

648
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,550
So we crossed the pass just like this?

649
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,050
There weren't even people interrogating us,

650
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:18,370
let alone assassins.

651
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,590
♫Passing barren lands and dangerous buildings by horse♫

652
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,910
Isn't it fun?

653
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:20,960
That's why

654
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,000
♫Rain flows outside the window at night♫

655
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,860
everyone likes to work with Boss Ning.

656
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,540
♫Holding a sword of frustrations from the world♫

657
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,160
♫Hiding gentleness deep within♫

658
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,290
♫Wandering through the world with wistfulness in the heart♫

659
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,070
♫Turning freedom into a boat that crosses the high hills alone♫

660
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:44,390
♫Passing through the clouds, love remains in the wind and moon♫

661
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,150
Your Highness.

662
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:48,590
Your Highness.

663
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,800
Your Highness, a secret letter.

664
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:02,450
[Zhou Jian set an ambush in Tushan Pass to kill the delegation under Marquis Yongping's secret order]

665
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:03,650
Ridiculous!

666
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:07,630
I must leave the palace immediately.

667
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,380
Tell them

668
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,730
I have a health emergency.

669
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,580
I won't attend the court meeting.

670
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:13,510
Yes.

671
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:25,370
Your Highness.

672
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,290
Her Majesty wants to see you.

673
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,260
Your Highness.

674
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:50,370
You ordered Zhou Jian to kill the delegation?

675
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,690
If I said it wasn't me,

676
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,350
would you believe me?

677
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,830
Zhou Jian is your cousin's brother-in-law.

678
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:03,220
If it wasn't you,

679
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,960
who else could it be?

680
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,190
We studied in the Imperial Study together for six years.

681
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,630
You know what kind of person I am.

682
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,740
Ying is also my sister.

683
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:17,190
How could I do such a thing?

684
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,080
You wouldn't have done that before.

685
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,500
But now,

686
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,620
I'm afraid you'd even want

687
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,500
your brother to die in the State of An right now

688
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,930
for the throne.

689
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,170
What is Ying to you?

690
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,310
Answer me.

691
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:36,030
Did you give the order?

692
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:36,690
It wasn't me.

693
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,020
It was my uncle, Marquis Yongping.

694
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:44,070
Even if I wanted to do it, I wouldn't have chosen

695
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,980
to do it before the delegation left the state.

696
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:49,490
In the end,

697
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,700
you still want Ying to die

698
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,220
and stop His Majesty from returning.

699
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:57,310
I was going to the Mansion of Marquis Yongping

700
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,420
to ask him to stop.

701
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,790
I have something to ask you.

702
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:10,290
When Father betrothed you to him,

703
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:11,429
you were unwilling.

704
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:12,560
You even wanted to escape the marriage.

705
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,550
After entering the palace, he favored others,

706
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,989
while you had no other feelings for him.

707
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:19,949
Why are you

708
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:22,489
acting like you love him now?

709
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:25,500
Did you fall in love with him all of a sudden?

710
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,610
There's no such thing as love in the imperial family.

711
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,060
It doesn't matter whether I like His Majesty or not.

712
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,400
What matters is

713
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,060
only he

714
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:42,120
can make me the most noble woman in Wu.

715
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:44,290
But if we work together,

716
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,130
you can continue to be the empress.

717
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,180
Yan.

718
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,260
Actually, I…

719
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,010
Actually, I still...

720
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,630
You know,

721
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:15,040
I still don't have a wife.

722
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:26,710
But

723
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,360
I want to be the empress dowager more.

724
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,740
Being the empress,

725
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,660
all my glory comes from your love.

726
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,970
But as the empress dowager,

727
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,730
my power will be in my own hands

728
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,690
before he takes over the throne.

729
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,180
Okay.

730
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:18,080
Boss Ning,

731
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,890
the valley is ahead

732
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:21,950
and the road is slippery from the fog.

733
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:24,290
I'm afraid that if we go further, the horses will easily fail.

734
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,590
It seems that we won't reach Shuzhou today

735
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,630
no matter what.

736
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,700
Tell them to find a high place

737
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,450
and put up camp.

738
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:32,350
Yes.

739
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,310
What's wrong?

740
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,630
Today is the tenth day.

741
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:01,570
Yes.

742
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:04,210
The poison hasn't taken effect yet.

743
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,290
We'll get the antidote

744
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,490
when we get to Shuzhou tomorrow.

745
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,000
You'd better not lie to me.

746
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:10,860
You'd better give up on this thought.

747
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,680
The Liudao Hall has a law,

748
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:14,850
which is that we can't

749
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,430
have any intimate relationship with our allies in missions.

750
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:17,960
I must follow the law.

751
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:19,700
I'm from the Scarlet Guards.

752
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,550
I don't need to follow the rules of the Liudao Hall.

753
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,730
But you are now our ally.

754
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,090
Am I that bad?

755
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:31,470
So bad

756
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,010
that I can't move you at all?

757
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:38,350
No.

758
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:39,650
You're good.

759
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,080
You can even say

760
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:43,100
you're one of the biggest temptations I've met.

761
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:45,790
Then why do you reject me?

762
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:47,970
I won't hurt you.

763
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:50,580
My reason tells me

764
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,090
we are actually the same kind of person.

765
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,020
I think you should understand

766
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,650
that for people like us in the martial arts world,

767
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:59,710
every piece of sudden fortune

768
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,040
means danger.

769
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,510
It's my honor

770
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:05,530
to have you like me,

771
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:08,580
but there are many good men in the world.

772
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,410
The safest way for us to get along

773
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:14,090
is to complete what we promised each other

774
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,080
and go

775
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,150
our separate ways.

776
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,150
You'd better keep your promise

777
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,960
and help me find out who killed Empress Zhaojie.

778
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,290
Or else...

779
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,640
Or else you'll kill me.

780
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,480
You've said it too many times.

781
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,940
My ears are getting calluses from hearing it.

782
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:32,440
It's your fault you lied to me about the child.

783
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:33,030
I...

784
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,810
The child's matter is different.

785
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:36,810
Plus...

786
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:41,670
I didn't expect you to be so easily fooled.

787
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:43,190
No.

788
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,740
Don't fight.

789
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,060
You may not be able to defeat me now.

790
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,460
Well,

791
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,640
I'm going to take Sun Lang's shift now.

792
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,110
Rest early.

793
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:57,990
I'll go with you.

794
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,290
Boss Ning.

795
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,420
Sun Lang.

796
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:11,550
Miss Ruyi.

797
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:13,880
Give it to me.

798
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,170
You guys go back and rest early.

799
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,590
Okay, let's go.

800
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:38,990
Lang,

801
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,660
Boss Ning doesn't let us

802
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:43,470
show off in front of Miss Ren.

803
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,570
Is it because

804
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,170
he's starting to regret things?

805
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,570
Shut up.

806
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,170
Everyone is betting

807
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,950
to see if Boss Ning will give in to Miss Ren.

808
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,730
Shut up!

809
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,260
I bet he won't.

810
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,170
Ms. Pei was close with Boss Ning before.

811
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:07,990
I've met her.

812
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:09,670
She's gentle.

813
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,130
Boss Ning likes that type.

814
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,090
I bet two strings of coins.

815
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:22,550
I bet he will.

816
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:25,320
Why?

817
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:29,370
Why not?

818
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,970
Because I like

819
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:34,510
fluffy little animals.

820
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:37,610
I saw Miss Ren feeding cats last time.

821
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,820
She loves cats,

822
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,720
That's why I support her and Boss Ning.

823
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:42,490
You've walked with me for so long.

824
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,470
You must have something to tell me.

825
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:46,490
What is it?

826
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:47,650
Go ahead.

827
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:52,400
I want to ask

828
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,900
how you get along so well

829
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:57,110
with Yu Shisan and the others.

830
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,140
Why do you ask?

831
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,250
Empress Zhaojie said

832
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:05,280
that I was a sword in my previous life.

833
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,260
I was born not to get along with anyone.

834
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,920
If she hadn't protected me and promoted me,

835
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,930
I would have long died from the Scarlet Guards' internal conflicts.

836
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,190
She kept telling me to change myself,

837
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:17,840
but I still don't know how.

838
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:20,260
Whether it’s with my godmother

839
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:21,760
or with Ling Long,

840
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:24,870
we spent quite some time together,

841
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,450
but it still felt like there was something between us.

842
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,100
I'm going to be a mother in the future.

843
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:34,090
I don't want to be

844
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:35,360
so cold with my own child.

845
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,530
So,

846
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:43,010
can you teach me?

847
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:47,110
Have you ever thought

848
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:49,480
why Empress Zhaojie wanted you to have a child?

849
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:51,670
No.

850
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,610
Why not?

851
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:57,310
Her Highness served His Majesty for more than 20 years.

852
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,350
Her vision and temperament were extraordinary.

853
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,330
If she wanted me to do something, it must be for my own good.

854
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:03,920
Why would I think so much about it?

855
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:05,570
You're right.

856
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,150
Do you like kids?

857
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:10,870
Of course I do.

858
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,910
Look into my eyes.

859
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,230
Tell the truth.

860
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,590
Actually,

861
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:30,420
not that much.

862
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,250
I hate it when kids cry.

863
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:37,540
Empress Zhaojie only gave birth to the Second Prince.

864
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,270
I should have liked him,

865
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:42,550
but every time he cried,

866
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:44,830
I would get so annoyed.

867
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,560
I think you should think about

868
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:53,130
why Empress Zhaojie forced you

869
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:54,490
to do something you don't like.

870
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:58,160
I also force Yang Ying to do what she doesn't like.

871
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,440
It's like practicing martial arts.

872
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,540
No one likes it at first,

873
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,620
but you get used to it after you learn it.

874
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,130
Anyway, I will definitely complete

875
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:11,670
Empress Zhaojie's orders.

876
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,130
I agree with this.

877
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:17,450
I still remember when I was undercover in the State of An

878
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,050
and saw the Scarlet Guards.

879
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:21,410
You're all perfect at obeying orders.

880
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:22,750
You have absolute obedience

881
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:24,880
for your superior's orders without changing a single word of it.

882
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:28,410
Empress Zhaojie wasn't like a superior to me.

883
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,820
Besides, when someone joins the Scarlet Guard,

884
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,740
you must recite on the first day

885
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:35,130
that those who disobey the order will die.

886
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:37,850
Isn't the Liudao Hall like this?

887
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:41,010
Of course not.

888
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:45,940
Whether it's Yu Shisan or Qian Zhao,

889
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,490
neither of them treat me as their superior.

890
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:50,820
That's true.

891
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:53,830
So?

892
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,410
You were deceived by Zhao Ji

893
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,270
because you couldn't control your men

894
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:01,550
and ended up in prison and the army.

895
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:11,640
You are indeed an excellent assassin.

896
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,420
Your words are hurtful too.

897
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:18,790
Alright.

898
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,270
Don't be sad.

899
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:26,270
When I was in the Scarlet Guard,

900
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:29,320
I didn't have many subordinates

901
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:31,190
who followed orders.

902
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:33,470
Boss.

903
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:36,390
It's our turn.

904
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:37,620
Okay, here.

905
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:38,540
Thank you.

906
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:43,590
Well,

907
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,000
go back and rest early.

908
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:46,970
We'll talk some other time.

909
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:04,570
Why aren't you sleeping?

910
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,740
You looked at Ruyi in quite a special way.

911
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:26,780
You even made a face to make her laugh.

912
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:32,870
Kids shouldn't think about this nonsense.

913
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:36,610
If you don't tell me,

914
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:39,260
I'll keep thinking about it.

915
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,100
Fine.

916
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:48,640
If you can't say it,

917
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:49,550
then let me ask you.

918
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:53,360
Do you have feelings

919
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:55,010
for Ruyi?

920
00:45:57,970 --> 00:45:59,450
If yes, look at your left hand.

921
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:01,100
If not, look at your right hand.

922
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:07,950
No.

923
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:11,270
Why?

924
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:13,670
No.

925
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,290
Ruyi is so excellent,

926
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:18,200
but you don't like her?

927
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,360
Why what?

928
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,880
Qian is also excellent.

929
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:23,180
Shisan is excellent too.

930
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,380
I don't like them either.

931
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:26,870
It's different.

932
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:30,240
No, how can you not like Ruyi?

933
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:34,620
I don't care.

934
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:36,930
You have to tell me anyway.

935
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:38,490
Why? Why? Why?

936
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:40,030
Why don't you like Ruyi?

937
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:43,480
She's right about one thing.

938
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:46,190
-What?
-Children are troublesome.

939
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:51,700
If you don't tell me,

940
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:52,970
I won't sleep tonight.

941
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,160
Fine.

942
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:04,410
Ruyi

943
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:06,830
is the most perfect assassin

944
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:08,930
I've ever seen.

945
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:11,370
She's calm, ruthless,

946
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:13,630
smart, and agile.

947
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:15,550
For assassins,

948
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,320
she's practically flawless.

949
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:19,700
I still remember the shock I felt

950
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:22,300
when I read her file for the first time.

951
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:24,790
She killed three military governors in one month

952
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:27,350
and made the State of Chu mourn in seven days.

953
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:32,690
At that time, I really wanted to meet Ren Xin.

954
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:36,280
I wanted to see which of us is more talented.

955
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:42,240
But I never expected

956
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:44,210
that Ren Xin

957
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:45,770
would be a girl

958
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,000
and so young too.

959
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,300
She's like a leopard.

960
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,180
But people like her

961
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:01,050
are destined to lead a bloody life.

962
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:02,650
But what about me?

963
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:05,990
I will retire after this mission.

964
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:09,460
We are not the same kind of people.

965
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:11,610
But...

966
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:13,960
But everyone thinks

967
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,800
that the way you look at Ruyi

968
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:17,490
is quite special.

969
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:22,890
Isn't it normal to do a double take

970
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:23,790
when seeing a pretty girl?

971
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:24,850
What's so special about it?

972
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:26,530
No.

973
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:30,250
The way you look at her is very special.

974
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:32,140
You give her special treatment too.

975
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,690
Sometimes,

976
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:36,090
you treat her even better than Her Highness.

977
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:39,930
Actually,

978
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:43,710
it's because I feel sorry for her.

979
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:47,700
For what?

980
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:51,510
Ruyi

981
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,520
is good at seducing men

982
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:55,440
as a White Sparrow,

983
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:58,540
but sometimes I think

984
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,090
she's like those puppets you make.

985
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:04,170
She only knows to kill

986
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:05,900
and complete her missions,

987
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:08,340
but she's never thought about

988
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,570
why she should jump

989
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:11,770
or why she should run.

990
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,680
She's never even thought to think about it.

991
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:18,490
She must have

992
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,840
suffered a lot when she was working as a Scarlet Guard.

993
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,450
So, even if I don't like her at all,

994
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:34,230
I still want to be nice to her.

995
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:38,010
I want her to know that there are

996
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:39,430
many interesting things in the world,

997
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,440
other than killing

998
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:44,400
and having babies

999
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:47,090
that she should experience.

1000
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:49,480
If...

1001
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:47,100
[Zhou Jian discovered the ploy last night and is furious. He's leading an army of thousands here]

1002
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,330
Oh no.

1003
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:51,550
Sun Lang.

1004
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:53,160
Boss Ning.

1005
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:55,230
Boss Ning,

1006
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:57,420
Zhou Jian found out he was tricked

1007
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,940
and is chasing after us with an army.

1008
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:00,960
Tell everyone to set out immediately.

1009
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:02,270
Follow our second plan

1010
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:04,060
and rush to Shuzhou at full speed.

1011
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:05,200
Take advantage of the natural environment.

1012
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:06,150
Yes.

1013
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:09,270
Everyone, get ready.

1014
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:10,260
Ding Hui, load the carriages.

1015
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:10,570
Yes.

1016
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:11,930
Yuan Lu, load the carriages.

1017
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:12,630
Load the carriages.

1018
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:14,870
Get on the horse.

1019
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:17,430
Everyone, get ready.
