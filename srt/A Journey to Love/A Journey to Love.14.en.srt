What did I tell you?

9
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,450
I, Yu Shisan, have a perfect grasp on human nature,

10
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,030
but...

11
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,150
Wait a bit longer.

00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,000
This is great.

191
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,750
After we parted at Jiangkou,

192
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,570
I really missed you.

193
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,510
I thought of you every day.

194
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,150
Wrong.

195
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,010
Not only did you run away the next day,

196
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,290
but you also forgot me completely.

197
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,810
Meiniang, this is a misunderstanding.

198
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:19,650
Let me explain.

199
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,250
From that day onwards, I... Hurry up.

200
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:31,390
Qian, run!

201
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,590
You won't escape this time!

202
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:45,850
Run!

203
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:55,200
Go!

204
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:06,710
Be careful.

205
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:09,910
Qian!

206
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,070
Chief, he ran away. What should we do?

207
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:29,950
Let's see where he can run to.

208
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,020
What?

209
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,690
We've been brothers for so many years,

210
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,100
but none of you trust me.

211
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,730
I really didn't do anything.

212
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,520
When I saved her, her face was covered in injuries.

213
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,550
I even said she's the most beautiful girl

214
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,700
in the world.

215
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,190
How long did you spend there?

216
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,200
Three days.

217
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:45,760
How did you leave?

218
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,210
She said she wanted to marry me.

219
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,620
I ran away that night.

220
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:49,810
I even left her some money

221
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:50,650
and Yurong Cosmetics Pills.

222
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,570
I also left her a sincere letter.

223
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,010
Wait.

224
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,020
You were dressed like this?

225
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,310
And what's that thing on your head?

226
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,710
You dressed like this

227
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,580
and went out, telling people you're Ning Yuanzhou?

228
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,120
I look great.

229
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,250
Not at all.

230
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,310
You're ruining my reputation, you understand?

231
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,330
Fine, I don't care about your trivial matters.

232
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,470
The most important thing now

233
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,360
is to get Qian Zhao back.

234
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,530
Boss,

235
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,280
The chief of Jinsha Sect sent a messenger.

236
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,010
Send her in.

237
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,680
Yes.

238
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,120
Welcome.

239
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,410
Sirs,

240
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,580
Chief Jin asked me to deliver a message.

241
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,780
You must give Shisan's head as the ransom.

242
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,640
Otherwise, we don't mind

243
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,810
keeping Mr. Qian in Jinsha Pavilion forever.

244
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:53,340
By the way,

245
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,120
our chief is in a bad mood recently.

246
00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:00,060
Next time, instead of me coming,

247
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:03,870
it may be Mr. Qian's fingers or eyes.

248
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,560
Goodbye.

249
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,390
What are you looking at? I'm not going.

250
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,650
I barely managed to run back.

251
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,840
What's with that face?

252
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,550
Didn't you hear what she said?

253
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,130
She wants my...

254
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,370
Enough. Shut up, Yu Shisan.

255
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,050
Keep watch here.

256
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,260
I'll go with Shisan.

257
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,160
Don't worry.

258
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,160
Yuan Lu, grab the things.

259
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:33,810
Yes.

260
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,620
I don't want to go.

261
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,940
He digs his own grave.

262
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:48,890
Ruyi,

263
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,790
won't you go take a look?

264
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,450
If anything happens,

265
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,150
they will come to me.

266
00:16:58,890 --> 00:16:59,810
Since they didn't come,

267
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,680
I should mind my own business.

268
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,290
Ruyi,

269
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,030
why are you so nice to me?

270
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,250
You keep saying

271
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,530
that you're teaching me

272
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,740
because you made a deal with Yuanzhou,

273
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,710
but I've had several teachers,

274
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,180
including Ms. Gu,

275
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:19,160
Ms. Pei, and Ms. Ming.

276
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,670
I know what you've done

277
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,740
is already far more than them.

278
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:28,130
Maybe

279
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,650
it's because I didn't treat a previous student well,

280
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,600
so I feel guilty.

281
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,600
Ms. Pei taught you before?

282
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,580
Then tell me

283
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,180
what kind of person she is.

284
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,340
Capture this traitorous

285
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,050
and unfaithful bastard.

286
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:14,630
Wait.

287
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,510
I'll show you respect.

288
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,340
Let him go.

289
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,080
Chief Jin, greetings from Ning.

290
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,160
Which Ning is it this time?

291
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:58,990
Ning Yuanzhou

292
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:00,480
from the Luidao Hall.

293
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,720
If you want to keep my friend as a guest,

294
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,580
you might not be ready yet.

295
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,790
Alright.

296
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:34,710
You are indeed the famous Ning Yuanzhou.

297
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,930
Chief Ning, you're so cruel.

298
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,520
Aren’t you afraid that, in my anger,

299
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,200
I'll stop cooperating with the Liudao Hall?

300
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,150
If everyone learns

301
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,660
that the Jinsha Sect is at odds with the Liudao Hall,

302
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,380
you should be the one that's afraid, right?

303
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,350
Chief Jin, do you still want to fight?

304
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,310
I’m tired.

305
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,850
Since you are tired,

306
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:03,430
let's sit down

307
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,520
and talk slowly.

308
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,690
No need to talk slowly.

309
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:09,630
You need to escort Prince Li to the State of An,

310
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,550
so you want to know about the in-fighting

311
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,540
between the imperial family, right?

312
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,030
I can tell you.

313
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,050
That's great.

314
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:16,870
Yuan Lu.

315
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,250
I believe these treasures

316
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,450
are enough to get some information from Chief Jin.

317
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,840
Am I short of money?

318
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,290
What I need

319
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,640
is a man.

320
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,550
As long as Chief Ning

321
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,460
is willing to be my intimate guest,

322
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,620
I can give you any information for free.

323
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,350
If you agree,

324
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,070
the grudge between Yu Shisan and I

325
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,790
can also be resolved.

326
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:53,890
Deal.

327
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:54,530
Shut up!

328
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,420
What do you think?

329
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,500
Sorry, my heart is not here.

330
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,010
Please excuse me.

331
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,670
Then you will never learn about this information.

332
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,350
The Jinsha Pavilion is not

333
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,050
the only organization doing secret information.

334
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:14,970
Goodbye.

335
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,080
Ning Yuanzhou

336
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,950
was engaged to Pei Jiuniang before?

337
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,470
I heard it from the maids' gossip.

338
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,290
It may not be accurate,

339
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,830
but they definitely canceled the engagement.

340
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:37,770
There's a big problem!

341
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:38,950
There's a big problem!

342
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,670
The chief of Jinsha Sect

343
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,910
has a crush on Boss Ning.

344
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,170
She wants to kidnap him.

345
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,630
Do you think these two

346
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,500
can stop me?

347
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,550
But as long as my people try their best to stop you,

348
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,290
they can stall you for at least 30 minutes.

349
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,830
This is enough for the Scarlet Guards

350
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:57,870
to receive my information

351
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,220
and find your Prince Li.

352
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,630
Prince Li

353
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,420
is heavily guarded when traveling.

354
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:04,830
But...

355
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,450
Chief Jin,

356
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,180
are you sure you want to go against the Liudao Hall?

357
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,700
The Jinsha Sect has information from all around the world.

358
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,730
Isn't being on good terms with me

359
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,020
more beneficial for the Palace of Hell

360
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,190
of the Liudao Hall?

361
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,750
I do want to work with you,

362
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,420
but not in this way.

363
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,500
I'm not asking you to marry me.

364
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,250
I just want to enjoy some time with you.

365
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:39,270
You won't lose anything.

366
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,760
Meiniang, you finally figured it out.

367
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,090
Do you know why I suddenly—

368
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:43,640
-Shut up.
-Shut up.

369
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,250
Tell me.

370
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,510
Why are you unwilling?

371
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,810
Because my child's mother

372
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,390
will be unhappy.

373
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,350
Who is your child's mother?

374
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,150
I'll kill her

375
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,270
if she dares to be unhappy.

376
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,870
Let's see who dares to kill me.

377
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,340
Why are you speaking so much nonsense with her?

378
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,360
My Lord.

379
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,070
It really is you.

380
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,270
My Lord.

381
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:47,930
I finally

382
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,910
saw you again.

383
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,460
You are Lin Lang?

384
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,220
[Emperor of An's Study, An Capital]

385
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,660
Yang Xingyuan finally ate food.

386
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,810
You've done a great job.

387
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,750
I dare not take credit.

388
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,330
The officials of Honglu Temple and I

389
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,550
were just playing good cop

390
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,630
and bad cop.

391
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,040
Rise.

392
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

393
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,300
Should the emperor of Wu continued to be shown publicly

394
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,960
at the Yong'an Pagoda as per Prince Hedong's orders?

395
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:37,870
Stop all of it.

396
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,880
The supplies for Yang Xingyuan

397
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,230
should be at the level of fifth-rank officials.

398
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,430
No more insulting actions.

399
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:46,590
Yes.

400
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:49,090
I took him in the prisoner cart along the way

401
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,240
to appease the people.

402
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,930
The First Prince is such a fool.

403
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,660
He intensified measures in the capital

404
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,290
without even considering

405
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,540
that Yang Xingyuan is still the emperor of a country.

406
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:02,830
If he really dies,

407
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,390
how can I continue to manipulate the State of Wu?

408
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,730
For the next battles,

409
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,790
I'm still counting on

410
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:12,350
the 100,000 taels of gold from Prince Li.

411
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,730
We can't let them

412
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:17,210
continue to guard Yang Xingyuan.

413
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,180
Call Deng Hui.

414
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,610
Tongguang,

415
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,920
since you are very knowledgeable

416
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,950
in the reception for the State of Wu,

417
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,730
why don't you

418
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:32,030
act as the host of the State of Wu's delegation?

419
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,050
Yes, Your Majesty.

420
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,380
This is unexpected.

421
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:41,910
That's the general situation.

422
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,580
If Old Mr. Sha hadn't

423
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:46,280
tried so hard to marry me...

424
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,110
They talked the entire night

425
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,420
from last night until now.

426
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,770
Is there so much to talk about?

427
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,510
If it weren’t for

428
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,730
Qian's hard work yesterday,

429
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,670
I definitely wouldn't have come.

430
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,700
Then, go back.

431
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,070
Is anyone there?

432
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,840
I want a pot of Huzhou purple bamboo shoot tea

433
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,200
in Nanling water.

434
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:08,950
Enough.

435
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,030
They haven't seen each other for a long time.

436
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,830
They must have a lot to talk about.

437
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,930
Let's wait some more.

438
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,650
Then why are you so absent-minded?

439
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:18,940
You didn't even change your clothes.

440
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,320
How am I absent-minded?

441
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,090
It's sour.

442
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,040
Is it sour?

443
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:27,970
Let me try.

444
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:29,730
Ning Yuanzhou,

445
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:31,210
come in.

446
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:42,710
Fine.

447
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,750
Now they're together,

448
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:45,860
while we're the outsiders.

449
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,910
What's there that we can't listen to?

450
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,120
We’ll find out on our way back.

451
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,930
Qian Zhao dear, have some oranges.

452
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,160
Yuan Lu, eat more.

453
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,540
Thank you.

454
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,190
Shisan, have some.

455
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:07,400
Chief Ning,

456
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:10,070
I'm sorry for my rude words previously.

457
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,310
Please forgive me.

458
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,730
Chief Jin, no need to be so polite.

459
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,570
You are a friend of Lord Ren.

460
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,360
Naturally, I have to be respectful.

461
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,040
You are Ruyi's peer.

462
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:26,520
You don't have to be so polite.

463
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,530
Have a seat.

464
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,030
Sit.

465
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,310
I didn't have time to tell you last night.

466
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:40,280
Meiniang is a Red Emissary that I trained,

467
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,430
starting from when she was a White Sparrow.

468
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,430
She used to be called Lin Lang.

469
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:46,280
Now, she uses the name Jin Meiniang.

470
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,750
I mentioned her before.

471
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:50,910
She's the one who helped me escape from the imperial prison.

472
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,090
Thank you, Chief Jin.

473
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,810
You flatter me.

474
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,310
You saved me

475
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:01,190
from a pile of dead people.

476
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:02,610
It's my lifelong wish

477
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,510
to serve you.

478
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:09,850
But it's truly admirable

479
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:10,910
that you could build

480
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,070
a business like Jinsha Pavilion.

481
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:14,130
I was just lucky.

482
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,280
After Lord Ren left the An Capital,

483
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,360
the Scarlet Guards were after me too.

484
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,730
I only survived after disfiguring myself

485
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,970
and injuring my entire body.

486
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,650
Then I met Old Mr. Sha.

487
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:26,770
He treated me well

488
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,180
and helped heal my face,

489
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,910
changing my appearance drastically.

490
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,760
I changed my surname according to the Jinsha Sect

491
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,490
and married him.

492
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:36,540
His injury relapsed three years ago and he passed away.

493
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,670
Everyone recommended me to take over the position.

494
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,090
I was wondering

495
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,610
why the Jinsha Sect suddenly rose up these years.

496
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,990
Red Emissaries are indeed extraordinary.

497
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,430
It’s all thanks to Lord Ren's teaching.

498
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,440
I only know how to kill.

499
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,650
I couldn't teach you these things.

500
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,480
Your achievements today

501
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,770
are all due to your own abilities.

502
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:59,080
I’m not being humble.

503
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,770
Don't you think

504
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:03,550
my subordinates' actions are familiar?

505
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,140
They were also White Sparrows?

506
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:09,810
My trusted subordinates

507
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,740
were all White Sparrows eliminated by the Scarlet Guards.

508
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,160
They controlled White Sparrows with drugs,

509
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,030
but you gave me

510
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,610
the detoxification method long ago.

511
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,500
You also taught me

512
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,860
that I must do everything possible to be independent.

513
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,000
I shouldn't give up on struggling

514
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,350
just because I'm in quicksand.

515
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,290
Without you,

516
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,290
the Jinsha Sect wouldn't be where it is today.

517
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,880
But don’t worry.

518
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,110
I never mentioned your identity

519
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,330
in front of them.

520
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:36,390
Good.

521
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,550
Tell him in detail

522
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,840
what you told me last night.

523
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:41,780
No need to hold back.

524
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:43,390
Yes.

525
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,120
Chief Ning,

526
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,140
the emperor of An has three sons.

527
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,550
Other than the Third Prince who is still young,

528
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,570
the First Prince and the Second Prince

529
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,800
both have support behind them.

530
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,040
However, I don't think the emperor intends to appoint the crown prince now.

531
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:59,970
Both princes are opposed

532
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,630
to your country redeeming your emperor.

533
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:04,240
However, the First Prince has always been greedy for money.

534
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,210
Perhaps you can make a breakthrough with him.

535
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,990
The one who agrees to redeem His Majesty

536
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,050
is Marquis Changqing.

537
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,950
He only emerged

538
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,210
after I was removed.

539
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,510
In addition,

540
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:19,000
there are few records of him in the secret files of the Liudao Hall.

541
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,550
Other than him being ambitious and scheming,

542
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,420
there is nothing else.

543
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:23,910
I wonder if Chief Jin

544
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,230
has anything to add?

545
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,390
Marquis Changqing?

546
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:30,170
Who is he?

547
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,410
You don't know?

548
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,700
Marquis Changqing?

549
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,640
Didn't I tell you before?

550
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:37,590
He is the emperor of An's—

551
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,070
Let me explain.

552
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:45,110
Marquis Changqing Li Tongguang's mother was from the imperial family.

553
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,110
After you left,

554
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:49,050
he followed the emperor of An to attack the State of Chu

555
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,440
and made many achievements.

556
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,420
He is quite shrewd

557
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:54,390
and rarely associates with any parties of the court.

558
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:55,990
In private,

559
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,140
he is quite close with the emperor's Noble Consort of Chu.

560
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:00,870
He was granted the title of marquis

561
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:02,010
because the emperor of An highly values him.

562
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,680
That's also why both princes hate him.

563
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,230
His mother was also from the imperial family?

564
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,970
Isn't his background similar to Jiu's?

565
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:19,770
Speaking of which,

566
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,010
I haven't heard from Jiu in a long time.

567
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,550
I wonder how he has been these years.

568
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,470
He should be doing well.

569
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,130
Chief Jin,

570
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:33,030
I have something else to ask you.

571
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:35,750
Lord,

572
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,040
won't you stay here today?

573
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,130
-Let’s go.
-Jinsha Pavilion must be

574
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:40,400
more comfortable than other places.

575
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,530
I'm afraid it's not convenient today.

576
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,190
We need to rush back for a meeting.

577
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,620
Ruyi wasn't here last night.

578
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,640
I really missed...

579
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,460
I was really worried.

580
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,030
Thank you for your information.

581
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,570
We will go back and organize it well.

582
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,590
You said that the Scarlet Guards

583
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,580
won't get close to this area,

584
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,540
but if all these people

585
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,130
from the delegation stay in the Jinsha Pavilion,

586
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,530
it's inevitable to arouse suspicion.

587
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:04,590
After all, you still have to open for business.

588
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:05,590
Yes.

589
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,770
Ruyi, let's go back now.

590
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,550
Let's go back.

591
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,120
See you.

592
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,020
Chief Jin.

593
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:18,550
I want to ask

594
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,170
who is Jiu?

595
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,630
Chief Ning, you should ask Lord Ren yourself.

596
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,080
Okay.

597
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:29,909
Goodbye.

598
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,210
Can't sleep?

599
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,590
A little.

600
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:57,470
I'll accompany you.

601
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:02,790
No need.

602
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,300
Chief Ning, with your good looks,

603
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:12,680
you should go to accompany the chief of the Jinsha Sect.

604
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,460
Why are you clinging to me?

605
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,290
Jin Meiniang is your subordinate.

606
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,210
Don’t you trust her?

607
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,730
Then what about Pei Jiuniang?

608
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,830
Why is she writing to you now?

609
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,900
Did you really get engaged with her?

610
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,210
Are you upset?

611
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,050
I'm not upset.

612
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:41,790
Don't avoid it.

613
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:42,990
Just answer my question.

614
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,070
You are upset.

615
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,670
Tell me why you're upset.

616
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,560
You promised to have a baby with me,

617
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:00,950
so I don't want you

618
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,270
to get involved with other women.

619
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:04,750
But you also said...

620
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,440
You said

621
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,110
you just want to have a baby with me

622
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:11,490
and you won't hurt other women.

623
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:22,050
Are you jealous?

624
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:24,780
No.

625
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:28,640
Fine.

626
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:29,760
You're not.

627
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:32,040
I'm really not. I'm just...

628
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,090
Just what?

629
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:38,030
I just hope you can keep your promise.

630
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,730
You can be lovey-dovey with other girls later,

631
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,610
but you can't do it before the child is born.

632
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,190
If I can't,

633
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:45,910
then why can you

634
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,010
be lovey-dovey with others?

635
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,520
How have I been lovey-dovey with others?

636
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,330
That day, when you were at the Jinsha Pavilion with those boys,

637
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,460
you were like this,

638
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,550
and like that,

639
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,450
and drinking with them.

640
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:54,610
Isn't that being lovey-dovey?

641
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:55,550
I was just...

642
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:56,570
Just what?

643
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,760
You told me you want to have a baby with me

644
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,350
because I'm good at martial arts

645
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:09,370
and because I'm tall,

646
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:10,840
but did you know

647
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,070
that for some things...

648
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,870
I'm actually quite petty about some things too.

649
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,750
Okay.

650
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:29,980
I won’t do that anymore.

651
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,620
But you have to be honest with me

652
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,410
about Pei Jiuniang.

653
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:39,030
Okay.

654
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:44,230
I was indeed

655
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:46,440
engaged to Pei Jiuniang before.

656
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,630
That was my godfather’s decision.

657
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,610
After I was demoted to the army,

658
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,310
the engagement was voided

659
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:53,860
and she was engaged to someone else.

660
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:56,800
She must be married now.

661
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,030
Besides,

662
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,250
she didn't write to me.

663
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:09,970
It was all Yu Shisan's bad idea.

664
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:12,150
He said this way, you would be jealous

665
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,250
and you could empathize with me.

666
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:14,090
Only then you'd know

667
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:16,060
why I was upset

668
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:17,260
when I saw you drinking with someone else.

669
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,310
Any other questions?

670
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,070
No.

671
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,750
Actually, I'm happy

672
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,370
when I see you angry.

673
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:56,220
It means you care about me.

674
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,470
Look at you.

675
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:00,720
Not only do you attract men, you also attract women.

676
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,760
Her Highness and Jin Meiniang

677
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,230
almost got into a fight over you today.

678
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:06,670
Don't move.

679
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,150
You used take advantage of me,

680
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:09,900
but today,

681
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,410
it should be your turn.

682
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,390
Chief Ning,

683
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:28,270
no matter when,

684
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,070
you're the one who gets taken advantage of.

685
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:45,300

How are you tossing it?

705
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,470
I told you to be careful.

706
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,760
Don't get it on their faces.

707
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,140
How is it?

708
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:55,920
Is everything packed?

709
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:56,680
Yes.

710
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,150
Hurry.

711
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,570
[Tranquil Residence]

712
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,020
Hurry up, everyone.

713
00:40:59,050 --> 00:40:59,360
Okay.

714
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,150
Guys, hurry up.

715
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,860
Chief Jin, welcome.

716
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,170
Chief Jin.

717
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,000
Chief Ning.

718
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,980
Chief Jin, you're being so high profile.

719
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,680
Aren't you afraid that the Scarlet Guards will misunderstand?

720
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,010
No.

721
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,790
I've discussed it with Lord Ren.

722
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,360
Sending the delegation off so openly

723
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,900
will make it seem that the Jinsha Sect has connections everywhere

724
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:43,170
and can connect directly to your country's court.

725
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,030
After you enter the State of An,

726
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,030
the An people will know you aren't without help.

727
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,130
They'll have worries.

728
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:49,460
After we arrive in the State of An,

729
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:52,330
we'll need to rely on you.

730
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:53,890
I will obey

731
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:55,010
all of Lord Ren's orders.

732
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:56,320
However, Chief Ning,

733
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,630
let me make it clear.

734
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,940
No matter what your relationship with Lord Ren is,

735
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,930
please don't get her involved

736
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,810
in the matters of saving your king.

737
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,260
After all, she was once a Scarlet Guard.

738
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,700
Please don't make things difficult for her.

739
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:09,970
You can rest assured.

740
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,550
I only asked her to teach Prince Li.

741
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,010
As for the delegation's matters,

742
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:14,450
she won't participate in any of it.

743
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,840
Actually,

744
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:21,360
I hope you can persuade her

745
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:24,070
to let go of the revenge for Empress Zhaojie.

746
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:26,730
She's even told you about this?

747
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:29,020
I thought she was just...

748
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:38,770
Chief Ning,

749
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:42,030
please treat Lord Ren better in the future.

750
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:44,050
Her life

751
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:45,880
was too difficult in the past.

752
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,240
As for the things you asked,

753
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:50,370
I'll definitely handle it for you.

754
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,890
I'll send a message to the Jinsha Pavilion in the State of An

755
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,110
and ask them to help wholeheartedly

756
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:56,490
for the scattered Liudao Hall members

757
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:59,130
to get in touch with you quickly.

758
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:00,390
Thank you.

759
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:01,980
But,

760
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,580
I'm voluntarily treating Ruyi well.

761
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:06,990
I don't need anything in exchange for that.

762
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:08,850
I hope you can keep your word.

763
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:10,030
Otherwise,

764
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:12,240
you’ll be the enemy of the Jinsha Pavilion.

765
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,270
You don't have to do anything.

766
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:16,110
Ruyi is the top assassin.

767
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:18,930
Would she forgive me if I let her down?

768
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,280
What's going on?

769
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:26,740
She cries and then laughs.

770
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:29,130
Aren't they afraid the Beauty will be upset?

771
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:32,640
It's my first time

772
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,330
seeing a woman who doesn't care about you.

773
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,200
To be honest,

774
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,260
you must feel sad inside, right?

775
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:38,750
Get lost.

776
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:39,530
Okay.

777
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:43,630
I think Chief Jin is really nice.

778
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,770
She’s pretty and straightforward.

779
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:48,170
Isn't this your favorite type?

780
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,920
Why didn't you marry her last time?

781
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:51,930
I like many types.

782
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,660
Besides, love and marriage are different.

783
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,420
I was born

784
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,400
to be a player who can't settle down.

785
00:43:57,490 --> 00:43:58,700
If I really marry someone,

786
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,570
I'll deifnitely run out constantly.

787
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,680
That would break her heart.

788
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:04,730
So, I don't ask for forever.

789
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:06,610
I only ask for the moment.

790
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,000
Otherwise, before the sea dries up,

791
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:09,940
I'll have gone first.

792
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,840
Don't be too sure.

793
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:14,630
Look at Boss Ning.

794
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,920
He used to be single and free.

795
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:18,910
He was engaged to Ms. Pei before,

796
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:20,930
but that was only to follow the Old Chief's will.

797
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:23,850
Now, he's also fallen for Miss Ruyi.

798
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,260
You

799
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:27,550
will meet the person who takes you down someday.

800
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:28,420
That's impossible.

801
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:29,930
If I meet her,

802
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,140
I'll die.

803
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:33,450
I'll wait and see.

804
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:35,740
By the way,

805
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:38,400
Ruyi told me she set a trap

806
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:40,700
to lure people from the Scarlet Guards' headquarters

807
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,800
to Qingfeng Temple in the Liu Town of He County

808
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:43,550
and then take action.

809
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:46,120
How far is it from there?

810
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:49,440
He County is under Jingcheng.

811
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:51,480
We can arrive in about 10 to 12 hours.

812
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:52,810
After passing He County,

813
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,110
we'll be at the original border of the States of An and Wu.

814
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:56,470
Is there anywhere along the way

815
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:58,920
where we can buy rare medicinal ingredients,

816
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:00,810
such as devil's trumpet and wolf's bane?

817
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,440
After passing He County,

818
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,370
the pharmacies in the State of An will sell them,

819
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:06,610
but these ingredients are commonly used by the army.

820
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,980
They might not sell them to you.

821
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:11,180
There are many large medicine stores near He County

822
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,380
in Mishan Town of the State of Chu.

823
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:13,850
However,

824
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,520
that's not the Jinsha Pavilion's territory.

825
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,430
It's okay. We can handle it ourselves.

826
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:26,310
Prince Li, Lord,

827
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:28,050
I bid you farewell.

828
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:29,750
If you have any requests,

829
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:31,790
leave a message

830
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:33,200
at any Jinsha Pavilion or Jinbao Inn

831
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:34,810
and I will hurry over.

832
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:35,990
Thank you.

833
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:39,530
Farewell.

834
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:47,910
Time flies

835
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:50,460
in the blink of an eye.

836
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:53,680
Meiniang.

837
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,500
Shisan,

838
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,970
are you crying now?

839
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:01,710
What are you laughing at?

840
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:02,610
-Are you crying?
-Get in.
