Wait.

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,479
I want to try the carving knife you gave me.

He's not tall and has a round face.

9
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,259
His chin looks a little like Sun Lang's.

10
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,040
His eyes look like Ding Hui's.

11
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,180
He has thin eyebrows.

12
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,440
He likes to have his head raised.

Actually, Yuan Lu didn't tell you this.

26
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,780
I'm really bad at sculpting.

♫Waking up sober, I only miss you more♫

28

to accept your knife just now.

37
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,640

The weather is dry. Beware of fire.

50
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,450
It's midnight.

51

Madam.

55
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,160
Since Mr. Yue died,

56
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,390
various branches have been dispersing.

57
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,250
I was injured.

58
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,460
I could only sneak into the State of Wu's delegation.

59
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,100
I finally got here

60
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,760
and found a marking of Yuheng Branch.

61
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,280
You sneaked into the State of Wu's delegation?

62
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,750
Tell me the details.

63
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,820

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,240
I saw you from afar.

68
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,560
Please allow me to report.

69
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,500
Go ahead.

70
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,110
When did you come in?

71
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,560
You only realized?

72
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,890
It's not like you.

73
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,440
Tell me, what happened?

74
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,580
You asked me to keep an eye on her

75
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,370
and now you're lovey-dovey with her,

76
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,200
walking around flowers and under the moon together.

77
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,500
Are you trying to make me blind

78
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,720
or did you not really notice that I was following you?

79
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,560
Ms. Yue saved my life,

80
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,830
but died in the hands of the villains.

81
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,420
I'm incompetent.

82
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,920
Please allow me to sacrifice my life to seek revenge for Ms. Yue.

83
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,460
No need.

84
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,250
You can stay in the delegation to find out more.

85
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,320
The headquarters attaches most importance to delgation.

86
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,640
In a few days, there will be a Red Emissary madam

87
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,550
who'd be coming personally.

88
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,900
You must find more useful information

89
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,150
so that you can give them an explanation.

90
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,660
Does that mean Ms. Yue died in vain?

91
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,790
She made so many contributions.

92
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,900
We've found out.

93
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,630
Ruyi is a police officer

94
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,230
from the State of Chu who sneaked into Wu Capital Branch.

95
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,620
The headquarters has sent Yuheng Branch to deal with it.

96
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,260
You don't have to interfere.

97
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,710
Ruyi...

98
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,950
Is a Chu police officer?

99
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,300
Yes.

100
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,770
Why would the headquarters think

101
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,860
I'm a Chu police officer?

102
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,010
That's just the identity

103
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,330
that Ning Yuanzhou made for me.

104
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:50,800
I deliberately left clues on

105
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,909
Yue Sanniang and Yu Lang's bodies,

106
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,720
using this as a bait for the mastermind behind the Wu Capital Branch massacre case

107
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,320
to investigate me.

108
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:58,960
No.

109
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,340
Did someone

110
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,850
erase the clues I left

111
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,200
and left signs that of a police officer's?

112
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,000
Who could it be?

113
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,080
It's Ning Yuanzhou?

114
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,060
Trust me to I have trusted him so much.

115
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,480
Liar.

116
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,250
Tell me. Why are you mute now?

117
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,770
I don't want to talk to you about this.

118
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,130
You're already 30.

119
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,320
Not 13.

120
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,980
Why are you not speaking your mind?

121
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,420
She's a Chu police officer.

122
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,510
Not a Scarlet Guard.

123
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,390
As long as she doesn't have blood of our brothers on her hands,

124
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,110
everyone will be over it in a few days.

125
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,640
If you really like her,

126
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,990
there's always a solution.

127
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,030
There are many things you don't understand.

128
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,530
-I know what to do–
-Yeah, right.

129
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,790
Beauty is a good girl.

130
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,710
She's cold on the outside, warm on the inside and straightforward.

131
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,400
Besides being a little brutal,

132
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,690
she has no shortcomings.

133
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:53,800
You're leading her on

134
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,670
while using her.

135
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,420
Is that appropriate?

136
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,400
That's not appropriate.

137
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,350
I, Yu Shisan,

138
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,850
I hate to see young ladies suffer the most.

139
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,040
So you must tell me

140
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,260
whether you have feelings for her.

141
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,320
Otherwise,

142
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,960
it would be awkward for us.

143
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,910
I don't know how to get along with her anymore.

144
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,290
Fine.

145
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,740
I've lived for 30 years.

146
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,000
And I've seen a lot of women.

147
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,560
Concubines, Princesses, Ladies-in-waiting...

148
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,580
Enough of that.

149
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,660
Skip this part and just go to the "but."

150
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,460
But...

151
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,600
Ruyi is different from them.

152
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,080
She is like a leopard.

153
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,350
She doesn't know how to be shy

154
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:42,640
and doesn't want to hide it.

155
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,440
She goes and get what she wants.

156
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,140
And only she

157
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,680
can fight with me.

158
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,580
I've been used to

159
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,490
protecting women.

160
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,950
But only with her,

161
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,510
did I feel like I have been protected for the first time.

162
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,920
I still remember when we were at Tianxing Gorge,

163
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,180
she broke through the raining arrows

164
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,400
and blocked all the attacks behind me.

165
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,060
I still remember how it felt

166
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,560
to fight along side with her.

167
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,320
Although I was surrounded by enemies,

168
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,490
I felt at ease.

169
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,190
At that moment, I thought

170
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,160
I could

171
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,160
make mistakes

172
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,220
and let go of all worries too.

173
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,660
And just fight our way through without much thought

174
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,200
like when we were young.

175
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,440
I don't like what you said.

176
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,290
Haven't I fought alongside with you before?

177
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,600
Does our brothers not deserve your trust?

178
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,050
Aren't you my brothers?

179
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,190
Do you want to sleep with me too?

180
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,320
Anyway, you said so much

181
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:36,930
because you have feelings for her.

182
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,060
I know you well.

183
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,620
You're just stubborn.

184
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,970
Life is short.

185
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,180
Why are you

186
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,190
feeling conflicted about something like this

187
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,020
sighing in the middle of the night here?

188
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,230
You don't understand.

189
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,410
In one's life, there can be many moments their heart flutters for someone.

190
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,220
But they don't have to take action every single time.

191
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,360
The fact that she's a foreign spy aside,

192
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,150
she's too mysterious and unfamiliar.

193
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,440
It's too dangerous for our delegation.

194
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,140
If I have retired and live in the mountains,

195
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,170
I might still...

196
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,020
But now I have too many responsibilities on my shoulders.

197
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,520
I have the entire delegation to take care of

198
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,060
and send Ying to the State of An,

199
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,440
and clear the name of Heaven Path's brothers.

200
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,260
That's my priority.

201
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,820
As for her,

202
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,140
she's just a passer-by I casually brought.

203
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,020
After the trip to the State of An is over

204
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,950
and our deal is done,

205
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,030
we both have countless blood debts.

206
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,070
We might even

207
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,980
have to fight each other.

208
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,880
If that's the case,

209
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,180
why should we start?

210
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,350
What are you sighing?

211
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,640
Then why did you carve something for her?

212
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:10,940
Exactly.

213
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,640
Why did I?

214
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,900
Maybe I just don't want her to be disappointed.

215
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,050
Did you see her clumsy tricks?

216
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,520
She gave me flowers,

217
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,560
and a carving knife.

218
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,840
And had tea with me at night.

219
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,950
She told me all her tragedies

220
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,220
and made me pity her.

221
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,870
But these tricks

222
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,810
are clearly men's tactics against girls.

223
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,890
But she worked so hard

224
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,160
and was serious about it.

225
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,580
I tried to get information from her.

226
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,400
She only saw a man

227
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,840
did that to her cousin.

228
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,390
Her cousin fell for it.

229
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,050
So she also learned that

230
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,860
and expressed her feelings to a man.

231
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,470
I don't think that's the case.

232
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,810
Didn't she...

233
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,500
I think she knows

234
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,780
how men and women gets along.

235
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,780
She really doesn't know.

236
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,490
She doesn't even like children.

237
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,700
She had a benefactor who treated her very well.

238
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,080
Her dying wish

239
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,340
was for her to stop being a killing machine

240
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,730
and to have a child.

241
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,280
Ruyi always listens to her.

242
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,500
Children do mean a normal life.

243
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:30,680
It means there's someone to care for

244
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,780
and constraints.

245
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,170
That's why I don't want to get married.

246
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,230
Just thinking about how when I wake up every day,

247
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,520
I have to face the same face, I...

248
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,840
That benefactor

249
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,970
really cared about Beauty.

250
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,790
She really cared about her.

251
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,700
She wanted her to have a child.

252
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,820
But she told her

253
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,410
not to fall in love with men easily.

254
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,860
So Ruyi only wants a child.

255
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,420
As for me...

256
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,460
I just happened to be someone she's happy enough with.

257
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:06,730
Impossible.

258
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,630
She definitely likes you.

259
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,400
It's just that she doesn't know it yet.

260
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,160
Otherwise, why didn't she choose someone

261
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,520
as outstanding as me, but you?

262
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:16,370
Perhaps.

263
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,060
That's exactly why

264
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:21,970
I became weak.

265
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,540
But I promise I didn't use her.

266
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,070
Whether I keep an eye on her,

267
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,220
or follow her,

268
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,590
I did it for the safety of the delegation.

269
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,920
Sometimes,

270
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,680
I even want her to be happier.

271
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,140
Because her life was so hard before.

272
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,700
In her world,

273
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,440
there's nothing else other than

274
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,160
executing missions and taking revenge.

275
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,780
Let's not talk about this.

276
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,090
No man in the world

277
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,540
understands women better than me.

278
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,400
Anyway, you have to listen to me.

279
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,520
Don't be like how you are tonight.

280
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,440
Otherwise, you'll be trapped and unable to leave.

281
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,510
From now on,

282
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,060
you have to keep a distance from her.

283
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,780
We'll be good to her.

284
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,270
Like brothers.

285
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,420
Like brothers.

286
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:14,840
Come on.

287
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,680
No, you haven't recovered.

288
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,540
You can't drink.

289
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,500
Cut the crap.

290
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,310
I just want to get drunk today.

291
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,300
Otherwise, why is there wine in my room?

292
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,250
Here.

293
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,140
Tell me.

294
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,100
Can I trust him again,

295
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,210
one more time?

[The State of An, Yuzhou]

Long live Your Majesty!

299
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,880
Is this the King of Wu?

300
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,800
Yes, it's him.

301
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,120
Die!

Fortunately, I didn't let you down.

305
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,460
I have found out the details of the Wu delegation.

306
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,450
Ridiculous.

307
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,500
You only know the number of people in the delegation

308
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,180
and Prince Li's temperament.

309
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,280
How dare you claim to have found out the details?

310
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,950
You don't deserve to carry out any mission.

311
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,720
Do you see that?

312
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,119
You should be patrolling.

[Zhiyang Palace]

314
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,520
I didn't expect the high and mighty Scarlet Guard

315
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,020
would be sent to patrol the streets too.

316
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,730
Not just patrolling.

317
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,640

You were the Right Emissary, but look at your state now.

Exactly.

00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,960
You scums don't get to say that.

Greetings, Young Mistress.

You still know that you're a rascal from Shaxi Tribe

and that I'm your Mistress?

335
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,400
I do.

338
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:12,520
Young Mistress,

00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,480
they are not ordinary women.

What do you mean by they're not ordinary women?

Why? You dare to hit me now too?

we should treat sisters like brothers.

00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:19,680
Yes.

373
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,190
Thank you, Your Highness.

374
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,410
It's harder for a woman to be an official than a man.

375
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,990
Don't take it to heart.

376
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,280
Goodbye.

377
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,290
[Scarlet Tribe
 Lu Geng]

378
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,620
I've long heard that Princess Jin Ming likes to wear riding clothes

379
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,080
and acts like a man.

380
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,990
But I didn't expect her to be like this.

381
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,910
But why did she suddenly stand up for us?

382
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,880
Her mother, Princess Anyang, once led the army.

383
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,240
She had to retire after marrying Duke Chu.

384
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,100
She's now in charge of 30% of the calvary slaves in the Shaxi Tribe.

385
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,030
Of course she knows better

386
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,290
what this official uniform means.

387
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,470
Greetings, Your Majesty.

388
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,300
Chu Yue!

389
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,540
[Duke Chu, Chu Yuan]

390
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,740
I haven't seen you in four to five years.

391
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:32,560
Look at you.

392
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,360
You grew so quickly.

393
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,410
You're different now.

394
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,190
Yes.

395
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,470
Thank you, Your Majesty.

396
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,320
But Your Majesty might mean

397
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,010
I used to look like a lady

398
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,420
but now I look like a lad.

399
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,030
Don't be rude.

400
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,810
Look at your temper.

401
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,280
You're really

402
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,410
like your mother.

403
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,440
I remember when she was young,

404
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:55,930
she loved wearing the riding clothes

405
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,290
like you.

406
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,030
But Chu Yue,

407
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,550
should we change it?

408
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,200
After all, you're a lady who's going to get married.

409
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,630
It's not proper

410
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,080
for you to be in riding clothes.

411
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,620
Your Majesty is going to bestow a marriage to me?

412
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:16,640
Smart.

413
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,100
Thank you, Your Majesty! Long live, Your Majesty!

414
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,850
You're thanking me already?

415
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,700
You haven't asked me

416
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,760
which good man I've arranged for you.

417
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,690
His Majesty won't randomly pick anyone

418
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,040
to be my husband.

419
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,930
I like her personality.

420
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:40,370
You should go greet your aunt first.

421
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,950
She will tell you in detail

422
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:43,920
what's going on.

423
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,200
Please excuse me.

424
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,110
Your Majesty...

425
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,910
won't be so petty as to just bestow only a marriage to me, right?

426
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,360
Isn't Your Majesty going to give me a gift?

427
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,190
You're not being courteous at all.

428
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,400
Then tell me

429
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,200
what you want.

430
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,480
Father only allowed me

431
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,440
to manage 30% of the cavalry slaves.

432
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,500
I want Your Majesty to give an order

433
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,380
to give half of the cavalry slaves to me.

434
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,820
Brother and I will each have half. That's fair.

435
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,650
Calvary slaves?

436
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,270
What do you need them for?

437
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,560
When Mother led the army

438
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,810
to fight for Your Majesty,

439
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,310
did Your Majesty ask why?

440
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,760
Don't be rude.

441
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,860
Enough.

442
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,600
I know

443
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,580
you are a slave to your daughter.

444
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,450
In front of me,

445
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,360
you only know how to say "don't be rude" in front of me.

446
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,080
You really can't control her?

447
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,440
Your Majesty,

448
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,530
Chu Yue was influenced by her mother.

449
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,540
She liked bows and horses since she was young.

450
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,270
She might even be

451
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,720
better than her brother.

452
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,260
But according to conventions,

453
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,220
the tribe's calvary slaves

454
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,190
can only belongs to the next heir.

455
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,010
So...

456
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,540
I see.

457
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,430
You also have your own difficulties.

458
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,260
You have your difficulties.

459
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,240
You have your difficulties.

460
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:26,730
How about I give you 300 of my

461
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,610
personal calvary slaves?

462
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,460
Thank you, Your Majesty.

463
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,840
Can Your Majesty give another decree?

464
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,070
To allow me to

465
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,330
be able to manage the calvary slaves by myself after marriage.

466
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,330
I don't have to give it to my husband.

467
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,280
Well...

468
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,270
Thank you, Your Majesty! Long live, Your Majesty!

469
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,250
You are...

470
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,410
executing it first and before you report.

471
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,680
I'll approve of that..

472
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,990
I shall take my leave.

473
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,570
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

474
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,000
With Chu Yue's temper,

475
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,830
when she becomes the queen,

476
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,900
I don’t know how many troubles she will make.

477
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:13,190
So I'm marrying her off to Marquis Changqing.

478
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,820
Marquis Changqing?

479
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,720
Greetings, Aunt.

480
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:43,580
Chu Yue, you're here.

481
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,140
Aunt, what's wrong?

482
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,260
Why do you look so sad?

483
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,100
It's nothing.

484
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,260
Maybe I didn't sleep well

485
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,600
from the journey.

486
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,620
His Majesty is giving you a marriage.

487
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,740
Do you know?

488
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,050
You're worried about the marriage His Majesty has bestowed upon me?

489
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,140
What's there to worry about?

490
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,530
Although Prince Luoxi

491
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,090
is not smart,

492
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,490
he's not that bad.

493
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,080
Not a prince,

494
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:26,930
but Marquis Changqing.

495
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,470
What?

496
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:30,910
Marquis Changqing?

497
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,820
Marquis Changqing’s mother

498
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,630
is Princess Qingning after all.

499
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,570
What does His Majesty mean?

500
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,300
My father is Duke Chu and my mother is Princess Anyang.

501
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,040
He wants to marry me to the son of a paramour?

502
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,740
Isn't that humiliating our Shaxi Tribe?

503
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,380
I'm going to go ask His Majesty.

504
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,160
Don't go.

505
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:58,320
His Majesty made this decision

506
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:59,880
in order to balance all forces.

507
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:01,690
After his 50th birthday,

508
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,250
he will send this decree.

509
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:05,950
Come back.

510
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,740
Although other princes have a noble status,

511
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,720
they are not as good as Marquis Changqing.

512
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:18,610
He is well-educated, good at martial arts, and handsome.

513
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,630
He made great contributions at such a young age.

514
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,460
He's in charge of His Majesty's guards.

515
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,180
He?

516
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,770
Is well-educated and good at martial arts?

517
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:28,780
Yue,

518
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,720
after you get married,

519
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,180
His Majesty will grant you 300 fiefs

520
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,960
as a wedding gift.

521
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:42,160
Such a one-in-a-million man

522
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,800
is the dream of so many girls.

523
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,720
Yue,

524
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,630
you should be content.

525
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,990
I know, Aunt.

526
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,490
I won't go to see His Majesty.

527
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,320
In any way, when I was little

528
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,860
and saw you crying when you got married into the palace,

529
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:11,420
I knew

530
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,530
that the women in our Chu family

531
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,640
can't make their own decision for their marriage.

532
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:19,940
Yue.

533
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,660
Alright, Aunt.

534
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,180
Don't be too sad for me.

535
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,060
Although I don't want this husband,

536
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,480
I still...

537
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,910
I still used this marriage

538
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,230
to get many things I want from His Majesty.

539
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,730
It's pretty worth it.

540
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:43,830
Yue,

541
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,090
Marquis Changqing is really a good man.

542
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,020
Okay, I got it.

543
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,670
Princess, aren't you waiting for Duke to leave the palace together?

544
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,460
Her Highness also said

545
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,980
she would find time to arrange a meeting

546
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,860
between you and Marquis Changqing.

547
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,200
What's there to meet?

548
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,580
How could Marquis Changqing be a good man?

549
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,800
I did that

550
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,360
to comfort Aunt.

551
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:12,840
She has enough of a hard time

552
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,780
in the palace alone.

553
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:15,990
But didn't Noble Consort say

554
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,760
Marquis Changqing is well-educated and good at martial arts?

555
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,300
Do you believe it?

556
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,920
Let me tell you

557
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,210
Cousin Yan is also in this army that was sent out.

558
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,080
I saw his letter.

559
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,300
He said Marquis Changqing's martial arts skills

560
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,380
are just ordinary.

561
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,660
This time, he just took the credit from his subordinates

562
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,120
and got the title of

563
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,380
the hero who captured Emperor of Wu alive.

564
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,060
Meet him?

565
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,880
Let's delay it.

566
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,880
I have to let them know

567
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,490
I'm not happy about this marriage.

568
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,050
In that way...

569
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,660
They can reward me with

570
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,860
other compensation.

571
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,960
If His Majesty can...

572
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,700
If His Majesty can give me his white royal horse,

573
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,560
it would be even better.

574
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,320
I didn't mean to leave my duty.

575
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,420
I just completed a round of patrol.

576
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,200
But...

577
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,600
Just now our young mistress

578
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,370
asked us to stand here as punishment.

579
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,740
I used to come from Shaxi Tribe.

580
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,550
I dare not disobey.

581
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,300
So,

582
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,740
the young mistress of Shaxi Tribe

583
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,770
can command you.

584
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,320
But as the General of Yulin Guards,

585
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:24,150
I can't command you?

586
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,280
Fine.

587
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,850
I'm going to correct your attitude today.

588
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,160
Punish them with ten strokes.

589
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:46,530
Remember.

590
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,210
As the Yulin Guards,

591
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,170
you should only listen to the imperial,

592
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,890

593
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,630

594
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,160

Stop!

597
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:04,910
It's you.

598
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,180
Last year at the horse race,

599
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,460
you stole my ball.

600
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,620
Greetings, Princess.

601
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,200
Why did you hit them?

602
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,380
Because I'm in charge of the Yulin Guards.

603
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:19,480
What?

604
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,740
Princess,

605
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,090
you want to beat me with the whip

606
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,660
like you did last year on the horse race?

607
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,560

608
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,640

610
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:44,050
Step aside.

611
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,460
This despicable man is taking the chance to revenge.

612
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,240
I'm sorry for causing you this.

613
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,000
Go back and recuperate.

614
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,100
Thank you, Young Mistress.

615
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,650
I'll give gifts to your family.

616
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,820
I'll buy you a drink next time.

617
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,880
Okay.

618
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,820
What's your name?

619
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:09,740

620
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,670
Okay, got it.

621
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,470
Xucheng is right ahead.

622
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,750
During the last war,

623
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,400
Xucheng was taken by An people.

624
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:39,080
So after that pass,

625
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,670
we'll officially enter the territory of An people.

626
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,350
We need to stay alert.

627
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,150
And, from now on,

628
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,640
in order to avoid the suspicion of An people,

629
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,380
the delegation and the caravan will act separately.

630
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,390
They can't be more than one mile apart.

631
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:54,900

636
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,470
Yes.

637
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:04,460
Let's split up.

638
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,370
Yes.

639
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,000
What about me?

640
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,140
You should stay with Her Highness

641

as a Lady-in-waiting.

642
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:16,760
But later,

when you pass the pass and you're handing over the documents,

644
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,190
Her Highness will definitely meet

645
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,160

646
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,280

If you meet your old enemies,

650
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,270
don't be impulsive.

651
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,670
We'll discuss it after we meet.

652
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,070
If I really meet my enemies,

653
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,620
they should be the one who should be careful,

654
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,720

Wang Yuan who guarded Xucheng was withdrawn yesterday.

His surname is Shentu?

684

The State of An has such a strange surname?

685

Since the State Book has the word "State" in it,

it should be handed over to the King of your state.

00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,520
They also know the situation here

744
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,620
at the Government Office.

745
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,520
They told us to be hold it in

746
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,540
and just let it go.

747
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:49,480
Let's go.

748
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:07,620
What kind of shabby house is this?

749
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:09,640
Hang in there.

750
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,620
Clean it up.

751
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,560
The place you will stay in the future might be more shabby.

752
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,180
Hang in there.

753
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,940
You've said this 800 times today.

754
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,720
Are you okay? Are you okay?

755
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,140
Shabby house! Damned rat! Horrible An people!

756
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,460
Shentu Chi is downright horrible!

757
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:39,010
All Shentu people have no conscience!

758
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,440
Stop cursing.

759
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,240
I want to!

760
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,540
Shentu Chi...

761
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,300
Shentu Chi is a bastard!

762
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,420
His subordinates

763
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,760
and the Empress who raised him

764
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,010
are all bad.

765
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:02,900
You...

766
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,800
Why did you hit me?

767
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:13,790
Sorry.

768
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,190
I'll leave it to you here.

769
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:23,520
I'll go out and take a look.

770
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:25,100
Sugar painting, sugar figurine!

771
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:26,820
Take a look.

772
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,680
The freshly made bunny.

773
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,340
Ruyi,

774
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,530
I dreamed of Qingyun again last night.

775
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,110
I dreamed that he gave me

776
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,610
my favorite rabbit.

777
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,190
Take a look, the freshly made bunny.

778
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,100
Do you want one?

779
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,300
I want a rabbit.

780
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,040
Take your rabbit.

781
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:43,740
Thank you.

782
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,440
It’s weird.

783
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,670
Mr. Qian wrote that

784
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,440
there were traces of Scarlet Guards around here.

785
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,780
But it's already dark

786
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,680
and we haven't found them yet.

787
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:06,180
Boss,

788
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:07,940
are you hungry?

789
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,520
Still thinking about hunger?

790
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,120
Mr. Qian is always cautious.

791
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,250
His information can’t be wrong.

792
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,160
Shisan is watching over Her Highness.

793
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:19,880
Let's keep looking.

794
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:21,950
Let's go over there.

795
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,460
Are you alone?

796
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,840
Xucheng's main tribe is holding a banquet to thank the delegation.

797
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,580
Her Highness and the rest went there.

798
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,670
Just now...

799
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,940
I made a mistake.

800
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:26,920
I know.

801
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:32,130
I'll go in first.

802
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,190
Why?

803
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,180
Because you're a spy sent by Scarlet Guards

804
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:09,630
I'm not.

805
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:10,780
You're still denying?

806
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,680
You met with Scarlet Guards twice

807
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,920
and spied on Boss Ning on his roof.

808
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:16,460
Qian and I saw it.

809
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:21,220
Chu people don't know how to dance Butterfly Dance.

810
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:23,490
During a barbecue,

811
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:26,010
only An people don't eat prickly ash.

812
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:29,420
No wonder you helped Shentu Chi

813
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,070
at the Governmetn Office.

814
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:32,940
You also dare to slap Her Higness?

815
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,420
It's a pity that Boss Ning has been a hero all his life,

816
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,740
but he was kept in the dark by you.

817
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,140
Die!

818
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,760
A traitor from Scarlet Guards!

819
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:42,420
Think you can beat me?

820
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:40,690
Ruyi! Mr. Qian!

821
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,700
Why are you back?

822
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:42,500
Come and help!

823
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:44,350
She's not a police officer. She's a Scarlet Guard.

824
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,080
What?

825
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,360
Hurry!

826
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,220
Even you want to kill me?

827
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:12,980
Stop!

828
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:16,060
Calm down.

829
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,530
Could there be a misunderstanding?

830
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,650
I saw her meeting with Scarlet Guards

831
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,110
and gave away the delegation's information.

832
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,460
Even if she is a Scarlet Guard,

833
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,540
we can't kill her now.

834
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:29,590
We'll decide when Ning comes back.

835
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:30,980
Say it again.

836
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:33,540
Say it to Sun Lang

837
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:35,630
who was forced off the cliff by Scarlet Guards.

838
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,320
Say it to Chai Ming.

839
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,080
Say it to the thousands of

840
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,160
Wu people who died

841
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,540
in this battlefield.

842
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,170
Yes, Yu Shisan.

843
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:45,440
If it weren't for the Scarlet Guards

844
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:47,500
who bribed Eunuch Hu to steal the map,

845
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:49,950
how could 50,000 soldiers be defeated?

846
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,660
Now the evidence is solid.

847
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,380
She wants to harm Her Highness and the entire delegation.

848
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,390
You still want to help her?

849
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:09,530
I'm sorry.

850
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:47,700
Ruyi!

851
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,360
Good. Very good.
