[A Journey To Love]

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,890
[Episode 37]

4
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,430
Ren Xin?

5
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:02,850
Yes.

6
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,880
I'm back from the Palace of Hell.

7
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:07,990
Deng Hui.

8
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,180
Take her down!

9
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,500
Father, save me!

10
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,210
What on earth do you want?

11
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,300
The question should be

12
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,290
what you and your son did outside Tianmenguan!

13
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,710
What does that mean? Tianmenguan?

14
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,810
Beipan is involved?

15
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,110
Kill!

16
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,590
Who are you?

17
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,060
What do you two want?

18
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,090
I'm Ning Yuanzhou, the chief of Wu's Liudao Hall.

19
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:05,840
I'm here today

20
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,750
to get you, an unworthy ruler,

21
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,460
to send reinforcements to He County instantly

22
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,730
to fight against Beipan.

23
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,330
Beipan?

24
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,840
Beipan is attacking us?

25
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,020
Li Zhenye.

26
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,360
Tell all the officials

27
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:18,960
exactly what you did

28
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,170
outside Tianmenguan.

29
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,060
Otherwise…

30
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,140
It was not me! It was my father.

31
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:25,850
Zhenye!

32
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,030
He told me to let Beipan's army in!

33
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,180
It was him!

34
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,100
You ingrate.

35
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,970
He said there've been complaints about him in the court,

36
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,770
so he's willing to use 50,000 taels of silver,

37
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,250
100,000 stones of grains, and several cities

38
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,160
to make a deal with Beipan.

39
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,170
Beipan will defeat Duke Chu first

40
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,620
and then pretend to lose to my father!

41
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,550
Shut up!

42
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,880
That's total bull!

43
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,460
This is the letter

44
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,540
Li Sun asked Li Zhenye to write to Beipan.

45
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,890
His personal seal is on it.

46
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,020
Li Zhenye's attendant

47
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,450
who opened the gates of Tianmenguan with him

48
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,760
can testify to it.

49
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,790
He's now tied to the dismounting stele outside the ancestral temple.

50
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,120
You can interrogate him anytime.

51
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,570
His Majesty has really…

52
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,610
Officials,

53
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,290
Traitor Ren didn't dare to kill me last time.

54
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,450
This time…

55
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,080
Miss Ren.

56
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,990
I'm Empress Zhaojie's only son.

57
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,320
You don't deserve to mention Her Majesty.

58
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:04,930
Zhen…

59
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,550
Look carefully, everyone.

60
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,890
This is what comes of treason.

61
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,440
You collude with Beipan,

62
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:39,970
you die.

63
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,510
The crown prince died.

64
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,740
The crown prince died!

65
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:10,890
Now,

66
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,660
are you still going to deny your collusion with Beipan?

67
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,870
Do you still think I won't kill you?

68
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,930
If you want to live,

69
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,570
you must issue a statement of repentance

70
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,160
and swear to the ancestors of An

71
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,410
that you'll deploy troops right away to repel Beipan.

72
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,210
I'm the emperor of An.

73
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,250
I don't take orders from someone from Wu.

74
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,490
Now that everyone knows your collusion with Beipan,

75
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,070
do you think you still have a way out?

76
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,250
Your Majesty.

77
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,250
Today,

78
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,310
either you die here,

79
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:55,980
or

80
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,170
you issue a statement of repentance

81
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,040
and send troops to He County.

82
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:14,450
Get me paper and a brush. I'll write it.

83
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,500
How can an emperor be reduced to that?

84
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,530
No.

85
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,770
His Majesty admits that Beipan people are coming.

86
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,460
No matter what, we must repel them.

87
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,290
Wait.

88
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,820
Master, it's a trap.

89
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,630
Don't be fooled by him.

90
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,230
Ruyi!

91
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,890
Go! Go!

92
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,530
Ren Ruyi is suffering from old injuries

93
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,050
and Ning Yuanzhou's internal force seems unstable.

94
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:09,770
Protect His Majesty!

95
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,190
Take them away.

96
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:50,740
Uncle.

97
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,440
Sorry I'm late.

98
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:11,830
Uncle, don't worry.

99
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,790
I'll enforce your final edict

100
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,710
and dedicate myself completely

101
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,340
to serving Third Prince.

102
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,360
What's going on?

103
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,730
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

104
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,670
His Majesty died. To maintain order in the court,

105
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,590
Third Prince is to ascend the throne now.

106
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,830
When has His Majesty agreed…

107
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,470
Did the late emperor have any other sons?

108
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:55,860
Or do you think

109
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,350
I, the late emperor's nephew,

110
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,520
am a better successor than Third Prince?

111
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,830
Marquis Wuyang, Grand Councilor Wang,

112
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,790
what do you think?

113
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,610
I can testify to it.

114
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,460
Last month, His Majesty summoned Duke Qing to the court.

115
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,030
He said Duke Qing has royal blood

116
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,080
and has been given the royal surname,

117
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,140
so he should do his best to serve Third Prince in the future.

118
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,970
I was there when they talked.

119
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,270
Any more questions?

120
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,260
Then

121
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,730
let us

122
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,550
bid farewell to the late emperor.

123
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,070
Farewell to the late emperor.

124
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,190
Please forgive me, My Lord.

125
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,120
Get lost.

126
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,430
I killed Li Sun without your permission.

127
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,630
But I don't regret it.

128
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,600
Because getting rid of him for good

129
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,710
is the best solution.

130
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,470
If I hadn't reacted quickly,

131
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:27,860
we'd…

132
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,390
He deserved to die.

133
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,670
Isn't it good that you're in power now?

134
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,790
Ning Yuanzhou wouldn't kill him,

135
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,430
but you couldn't miss this great chance.

136
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,870
An is leaderless now but you can lead the army.

137
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,670
As long as you repel Beipan,

138
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,690
you'll be the ruler of An.

139
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,000
If Li Sun was still alive,

140
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,710
you'd have to be on the run.

141
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,420
Taking a leap of faith is better than being a sitting duck.

142
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,370
I deserve death for taking such liberties.

143
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,230
Please punish me.

144
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,590
I won't regret it

145
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,390
even if the price is death.

146
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,490
You've pushed me past the point of no return.

147
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,310
Why would I kill you?

148
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,470
To send you to hell with Li Sun?

149
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,110
The late emperor perished unexpectedly

150
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,320
and returned to the cosmos.

151
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,750
With God's blessing

152
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,830
and by the will of God,

153
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,550
I'll ascend the throne.

154
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,840
However, as a young emperor,

155
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,190
I don't have the ability to rule yet.

156
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:15,970
Therefore, Duke Qing, Li Tongguang, will be the regent

157
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,230
to keep order in the court.

158
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,150
The invasion from Beipan

159
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,270
is the most pressing concern now.

160
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,270
So the mourning shall be simple

161
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,790
and end in three days.

162
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,150
Spread this edict far and wide

163
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,550
to let all be known.

164
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,380
All officials, for their loyalty and diligence,

165
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,750
will be rewarded with two years' salary.

166
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,630
The imperial grace also extends to their offspring.

167
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,910
Duke Chu, Duke Cui,

168
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,310
Prince Jin,

169
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,440
and Princess Chu Yue

170
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,790
will each be granted an additional fief of 300 households.

171
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,070
A bastard has become the regent.

172
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,270
Shazhong Tribe will not obey him!

173
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,270
-No.
-Definitely not!

174
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:01,550
[The horse riding arena of Shazhong Tribe]

175
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,230
Why? This is not right!

176
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,350
-Why?
-Why?

177
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,230
-On your knees!
-Why?

178
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,230
I've also taken care of the tribes

179
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,910
that used to be on First Prince's side.

180
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,230
Thank you.

181
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,310
I knew you'd help me

182
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,540
but didn't expect you to help me so much.

183
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,190
Two generations back,

184
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,890
eight out of ten Deng family's men

185
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,780
died at Beipan people's hands.

186
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:39,110
The father and son let Beipan people in,

187
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,990
so they don't deserve my loyalty anymore.

188
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:44,910
I knew you'd do it

189
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,390
but didn't expect it to be so soon.

190
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,400
Being a regent is hard.

191
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,870
Watch out for yourself.

192
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:04,470
Yunxiang.

193
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,010
The imperial edict to make you the empress dowager will be issued soon.

194
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,150
The Chu family will be the leader of Shaxi Tribe.

195
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,680
Chu Yue will get an additional fief of 300 households.

196
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:23,480
I

197
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,510
have fulfilled my promise in advance.

198
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,470
I hope

199
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,760
you can take good care of the young emperor

200
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,190
as we agreed.

201
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,350
The situation is perilous at the front line.

202
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,630
I'm leading troops to reinforce your brother.

203
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,260
From now on,

204
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,530
don't upset me again.

205
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,630
Otherwise,

206
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,980
don't blame me for going hard on you.

207
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,960
[Duke Qing's Mansion]

208
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,660
Master,

209
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,290
I know this is not right.

210
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,030
But after tonight,

211
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,030
I'm going to fight at He County with little chance of surviving.

212
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,870
I don't expect to come back alive and see you again.

213
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:43,190
I can only say goodbye to you in this way.

214
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,230
A double dose of the muscle-softening powder

215
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,670
is not enough to make me give in.

216
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,660
Now, at once,

217
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,710
release Ning Yuanzhou.

218
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,670
I'll release him.

219
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,120
This is the antidote to the muscle-softening powder.

220
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,320
Here, take it.

221
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,960
Wait for me.

222
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,010
I have some scores to settle with him.

223
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,900
Even the heavily guarded imperial prison can't keep you away.

224
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,190
I should've known better

225
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,780
and shattered your shoulder blades.

226
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,990
Even if it had been hell,

227
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,780
I'd still come back to take your life.

228
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,710
The first two punches are for attacking me.

229
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,300
The last kick is for stealing my woman.

230
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,030
Li Tongguang.

231
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,500
You're a coward.

232
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,750
You only dare to use dirty tricks

233
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,510
to threaten and force her.

234
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,480
You don't deserve to be a man.

235
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,750
Even if I don't,

236
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,490
I don't regret it.

237
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,260
I'm not like you.

238
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:44,840
You're a candy ass.

239
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,130
You didn't even dare to kill the old emperor.

240
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,430
You're wrong.

241
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,950
I'm not a candy ass.

242
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,750
I just know what I should and shouldn't do.

243
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:03,840
I let him live and will let you live.

244
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,610
It's just because sparing lives

245
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,770
can save more people than taking lives.

246
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:13,990
Li Tongguang.

247
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,960
If you want to be a real man,

248
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,550
you have to let go of some of your obsessions.

249
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,390
If you want to become a man

250
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,650
who rules,

251
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,140
you have to put people's lives

252
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,870
before your power and position.

253
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:32,570
If it weren't for

254
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:36,410
your full commitment to the war against Beipan,

255
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,230
do you think Liudao Hall's reincarnation sword

256
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,830
would let you off?

257
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,250
You look amazing in red.

258
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,420
When we get married in the future,

259
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,870
you should be dressed like this too.

260
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,310
Okay?

261
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:20,880
No.

262
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,010
Not in the future.

263
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,230
We'll get married now,

264
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:29,830
at once,

265
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:31,670
right away.

266
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:33,460

Gather all the Imperial Guards

325
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,390
of Yulin, the court, and the cavalry camp,

326
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,710
together with the troops of Shadong and Shazhong.

327
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:36,990
I'll go to battle as soon as possible.

328
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,020
But Shadong Tribe and Shazhong Tribe

329
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,830
may not agree to send troops at this moment.

330
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,880
Why don't you quell civil unrest first

331
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:46,550

332
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:52,150
If I prioritized personal interests over national defense,

333
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,830
I'd be no different from that old man.

334
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,750
If they refuse,

335
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,220
let them be.

336
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,750
Even if I only have thousands of Yulin Guards

337
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,110
and the cavalry slaves of Shaxi Tribe,

338
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:04,790
I'll go to battle personally.

339
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:08,910
At worst,

340
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:12,550
I'd go down in history as a regent

341
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,990
who had no allies and died fighting.

342
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:19,470
You'll not die fighting without any allies.

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,710

344
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,790
I'm here with a letter from Wu.

345
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,220
Leave us.

346
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,870
According to Liudao Hall's secret source,

347
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,390
Beipan people have rallied all their forces

348
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:42,070
and come back with an army of 50,000.

349
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,670
My brother is defending He County personally,

350
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,590
so he appointed me envoy

351
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,550
to present the national letter.

352
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:03,030
[National Letter]

353
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:07,280
This letter has the seals of my brother and Brother Danyang.

354
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:10,670
It says that Beipan's invasion

355
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,630
will subject countless civilians, young and old, men and women,

356
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,710
to brutal violence.

357
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,390
Therefore,

358
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:20,180
Wu is willing to put aside the old feuds

359
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:21,550
and form an alliance with An.

360
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:26,070
We'll pour every resource we have into fighting the enemy with An.

361
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,170
Tomorrow,

362
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,380
I'll discuss it with high-ranking officials

363
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,750
before formally replying to this letter.

364
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,480
The situation is highly volatile.

365
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,670
You can send a messenger pigeon back now

366
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,230
and tell your emperor

367
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,750
that I'm grateful for his support

368
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:56,230
and he can take action

369
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,750
as he sees fit.

370
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,300
As you wish.

371
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,350
Aren't you leaving?

372
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,900
There's something else I want from you.

373
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:28,870
What's it?

374
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,230
Marriage letter.

375
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:33,490
I want to marry you.

376
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,260
Just taking power, you're fretting over

377
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,480
disobedient tribes, aren't you?

378
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,080
The whole world knows the late emperor of An appointed me crown princess.

379
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,980
If I marry you,

380
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,900
the whole state of Wu

381
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,350
will become your backup.

382
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,430
With this national letter

383
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:03,470
and the reinforcements of my two brothers,

384
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:05,130
no one in An

385
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,840
dares to question you again.

386
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,510
The wedding dress Ruyi took off,

387
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,630
I'll wear it.

388
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,450
The mess you made,

389
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,620
I'll clean it up.

390
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:44,420
Don't worry. I don't love you,

391
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,540
but I'll be a good wife

392
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,910
and help you hold An.

393
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,630
And help my brothers, Yuan Lu,

394
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,470
and myself

395
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:02,590
hold our beloved home country, Wu.

396
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,260
As you wish.

397
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:11,710
On the 17th,

398
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,840
Yang Ying and Li Tongguang got married.

399
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,220
Wu and An officially formed an alliance.

400
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,750
On the 18th,

401
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,340
Li Tongguang went to war with an army of 30,000.

402
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:21,240
On the same day,

403
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,950
Beipan's Left Worthy Prince attacked He County again.

404
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:27,010
Leader of Shaxi and Liudao Hall joined hands to fight back.

405
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,330
Looks like we need to hurry up.

406
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:32,930
Chief.

407
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,110
There's something else.

408
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,230
Who are you?

409
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:09,540
[He County]

410
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,840
[The next day]

411
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,360
Hold your ground!

412
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,810
Or no one can go back alive!

413
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,130
No.

414
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:41,020
His Majesty has been taken by a Beipan soldier.

415
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,850
Your Majesty!

416
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,740
His Majesty has been taken by a Beipan soldier.

417
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,550
Your Majesty.

418
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,120
Where is His Majesty?

419
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:46,280
His Majesty has been taken by a Beipan soldier!

420
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,920
[Beipan's Left Worthy Prince]

421
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,950
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

422
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,030
Save His Majesty!

423
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:58,360
Who are you?

424
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:14,030
Remember my name.

425
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:17,750
I'm the most handsome man in the world, Yu Shisan.

426
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,350
We won!

427
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,710
We won!

428
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,710
We won! We won!

429
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,000
We won!

430
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,590
We won!

431
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,000
We won! We won!

432
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,989
We won! We won!

433
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:39,870
We won!

434
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:42,130
We won! We won!

435
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,989
We won!

436
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,600
In December, the sixth year of Wu's Yongyou reign period,

437
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:50,500
Wu and An's troops met at He County

438
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,310
and defeated Beipan.

439
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,110
Left Worthy Prince was captured alive.

440
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,550
Your idea was brilliant.

441
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,100
You came back in time to make it feasible.

442
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,270
We couldn't have defeated Beipan

443
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:25,090
without the generous help of fearless people like you.

444
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:35,720
Great hero.

445
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,440
Great hero.

446
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,110
So cute.

447
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,730
This is

448
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:43,870
for the great hero who drove away Beipan people.

449
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:44,900
Thank you.

450
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,910
You'll become a hero too, okay?

451
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:47,550
Okay.

452
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,960
Last time, you helped me escape.

453
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,880
This time, you helped the troops repel Beipan people.

454
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,550
Let me drink to you again.

455
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,830
You can become a general too.

456
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,290
Hero, put him down.

457
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,030
Your Majesty was determined to repel the enemy.

458
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:05,750
Of course we'd all be at your command.

459
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,660
Big hero, you must be tired.

460
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,640
Eat something.

461
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,510
Thank you, Madam.

462
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,100
He's over there.

463
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:21,510
Careful.

464
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,070
Thank you.

465
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:23,910
Thank you, Madam.

466
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:24,470
Young man.

467
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,270
You scared me.

468
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,870
Let's go.

469
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:27,550
Here, here.

470
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,680
-Leader of Shaxi is calling you.
-Let's go.

471
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,400
He's Chu Yue's father.

472
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,130
Who is Chu Yue?

473
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,290
Princess Jin Ming.

474
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:32,890
Jin…

475
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,230
-Let's go.
-Princess Jin Ming?

476
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,370
Here you are.

477
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,350
Leader of Shaxi.

478
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,520
It was this commandant of Liudao Hall

479
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,670
who came up with the great idea of pretending to be a Beipan soldier.

480
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,430
This is my son Chu Xu.

481
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,190
Nice to meet you.

482
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:45,950
[Chu Xu, Duke Chu's son, Chu Yue's elder brother]

483
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,010
It was your first battle.

484
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,390
You've got a lot to learn from him.

485
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,820
You flatter me.

486
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,950
What's your name, young man?

487
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:54,910
My name is Yu...

488
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,000
Ershisan.

489
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,950
What a weird name.

490
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,910
Forget it. Bring us the wine.

491
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,690
Cheers.

492
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:07,850
Cheers.

493
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,280
Cheers.

494
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,180
Your Majesty, I shall take my leave.

495
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,080
I'm fine. I'm not hurt.

496
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,650
I told you to stay in the posthouse to have a good rest.

497
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,400
Why did you come out?

498
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,040
I heard you won the battle.

499
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,110
I couldn't wait to see you.

500
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,220
Where are Yuan Lu, Qian Zhao, and Sun Lang?

501
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,880

Nothing.

530
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,280
I was worried telling you

531
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:38,990
would affect your recovery.

532
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:42,830

Without him,

544
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:06,960
