[Episode 40]

4
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:53,890
Here, slowly.

5
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,610
Okay.

6
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:56,690
I'm fine. I'm fine.

7
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:57,450
Come on, bro.

8
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:00,810
Hang in there.

9
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:01,470
Sit here.

10
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,410
Okay.

11
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,310
The doctor will be here soon.

12
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,110
It hurts a little.

13
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:05,710
I'm fine.

14
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:09,800
I'll get some water.

15
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:16,610
It's okay.

16
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:17,930
Just apply some medicine and you'll be fine.

17
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:19,800
Thank you.

18
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,690
Let me wrap it up for you.

19
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,560
Thank you.

20
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,250
Here.

21
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:30,650
Here.

22
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:32,720
Boss.

23
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,340
Not counting those outside the city,

24
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,490
there are already more than 600 people

25
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,630
who died on the city walls.

26
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,380
They were all stoned to death with riprap by Beipan people.

27
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,210
Boss, forgive me.

28
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,300
Forgive me.

29
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,650
It's not your fault.

30
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,600
Don't think about it.

31
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,260
Focus on recuperating.

32
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,040
Take him away.

33
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,550
Hang in there. Hang in there.

34
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,050
It's almost done.

35
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,090
Hang in there.

36
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,720
Hang in there.

37
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,640
Come on. Hold him down.

38
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,260
Okay.

39
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,720
Dongzi.

40
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,480
The lamb soup is ready.

41
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,200
Get up and drink it now!

42
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,610
This lamb soup is really good.

43
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,610
Dongzi, wake up.

44
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,270
Get up and have a sip, Dongzi!

45
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,730
Dongzi.

46
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,650
The young ones are all gone.

47
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,320
We're the only two old guys left.

48
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,570
Tell me if you leave.

♫Suddenly encountering the joy of meeting and the sorrow of parting♫

50
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,570
♫Like rain and snow flying everywhere♫

51
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,020
Do you regret

52
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,570
that I tricked you out with the name of a beautiful princess?

53
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,230
What's there to regret?

54
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,610
♫Just like the tears in the corners of our eyes♫

55
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,490
In this lifetime,

56
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,930
I, Yu Shisan, will drink the strongest wine

57
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,310
and look at the most beautiful ladies.

58
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:40,830
Make the best friends

59

♫They're so close to falling♫

60
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,170
and fight the most magnificent battles.

61
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,250
I'll get going.

62
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:45,950

You're here.

92
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,890
Were you thinking of Shisan?

93
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,250
Yu Shisan...

94
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,530
has told countless lies in his life.

95
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,240
But this time, he told me

96
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,240
he was leaving...

97
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,280
and he really left.

98
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,280
Ying cried with Chu Yue for a long time.

99
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,600
She said

100
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,710
Yu Shisan's wishes have all been fulfilled.

101
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:07,960
He should be very happy.

102
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,550
Ruyi.

103
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,370
From now on,

104
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,940
promise me.

105
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,290
Okay.

106
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,980
I haven't said what you should promise me yet.

107
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:36,970
I know.

108
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,220
I won't die.

109
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,040
You too.

110
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,210
Okay.

111
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,090
Yuanzhou! Ruyi!

112
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,410
Ruyi, wake up!

113
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:33,650
Yuanzhou!

114
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,130
What's wrong?

115
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:35,920
Bad news.

116
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,450
Li Tongguang left a letter.

117
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,860
I don't know what's wrong with him.

118
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,050
He left the city in the middle of the night.

119
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,130
He said he was going to assassinate Beipan's king.

120
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:43,640
Master.

121
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,020
I couldn't lead the army well,

122
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,130
and even caused the death of hundreds of prisoners,

123
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,080
Yu, and Deng

124
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:54,960
because of my momentary benevolence.

125
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,000
Attention, generals!

126
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,710
Attack!

127
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,930
Split into two wings

128
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,950
and flank the rear

129
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,400
to surround Beipan on both sides!

130
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,750
We suffered heavy casualties because
I, the commander-in-chief, was incompetent.

131
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,150
I couldn't be the hero you want.

132
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:17,160
So, I can only try to assassinate Beipan's king.

133
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,520
If I succeed,

134
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,400
He County still has a chance of survival.

135
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,460
If I lose,

136
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,370
I can still die heroically in battle

137
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,750
and for my country

138
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,270
like you said.

139
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,010
And I wouldn't drag Yang Ying down.

140
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,160
I'll leave

141
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,140
He County to you.

142
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,570
From Jiu.

143
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,590
This fool.

144
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,470
How long has he been gone?

145
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,710
I don't know.

146
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,210
But two hours ago,

147
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,780
he was still there when I woke up in the middle of the night.

148
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,910
Jiang Qiong, guard the city tower.

149
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,090
I’ll go find Duke Qing.

150
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:01,880
Yes.

151
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,570
Jiu's over there.

152
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,020
I'll go and save him.

153
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:09,950
No.

154
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,290
You're more injured than I am.

155
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,270
I'll bring him back.

156
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,110
I'm his master.

157
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,550
Because you're his master,

158
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,520
I'll definitely bring him back.

159
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,400
Ruyi, trust me.

160
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,700
You guard the city. I'll go.

161
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,030
Listen to me this time.

162
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,230
Remember our oath.

163
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,370
I'll never forget it.

164
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,760
Leader of Shaxi.

165
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,600
I'll leave the city's defense to you and Ruyi.

166
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:42,560
Let's go!

167
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:48,740
Shoot!

168
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,920
There are bombs! Watch out!

169
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,210
I don't want you to save me!

170
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,440
I'm not saving you!

171
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,740
I'm saving the An people

172
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,010
and the State of An's regent.

173
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,220
It's easy for you to die.

174
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,730
But who'll clean up the mess?

175
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,590
I don't care.

176
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,090
Do I have to stand by and do nothing

177
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,560
when Deng Hui and Yu Shisan

178
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,990
died because of me?

179
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,970
Come back!

180
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,880
Listen.

181
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,180
If anything happens to you now,

182
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,290
within two hours,

183
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,160
the news of Duke Qing being captured by Beipan

184
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,370
will spread throughout the world.

185
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,770
Then, the State of An will be in chaos,

186
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,160
and there will be no leader in the court.

187
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,800
Is this what you want,

188
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,510
Li Tongguang?

189
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,690
Attack the city in full force!

190
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,010
Take them down!

191
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,210
I know you feel guilty.

192
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,350
But now's not the time to be impulsive.

193
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,900
I'm incompetent.

194
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,900
Listen!

195
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,810
This is no time to apologize and blame yourself.

196
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:04,650
You have to take the responsibility.

197
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,810
You have to bear the failure

198
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,290
and the pain of losing your comrades.

199
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,250
So for us,

200
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,170
you have to shoulder the burden on your shoulders.

201
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,540
Understand?

202
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,240
Okay.

203
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,220
Now,

204
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,240
let's go back together.

205
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,280
Let's go back alive.

206
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:28,560
Okay.

207
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:40,980
Let's go.

208
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,660
You're following me without a fight.

209
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,300
When did you become so obedient?

210
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,210
I can't let Master down anymore.

211
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,120
I can't let you down anymore either.

212
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,620
You've improved.

213
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,620
I've taught you so much.

214
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,510
Why don't you call me Master?

215
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,970
Master! Boss Ning! Ning!

216
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:41,830
Satisfied?

217
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,940
Why are you so reluctant?

218
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,040
It's not enough. Say it again.

219
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,260
I know you're stubborn.

220
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,750
Do you see the siege engine there?

221
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,430
We'll run over

222
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,880
and climb up the wall along the siege engine.

223
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,460
Okay, let's run together.

224
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,900
You go first. I'll cover for you.

225
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,310
No, you can't be my shield.

226
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:07,260
What are you thinking?

227
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,210
I'm Ning Yuanzhou, Liudao Hall's leader.

228
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:11,089
In this world, only your master can hurt me,

229
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:11,930
no one else.

230
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:12,410
No!

231
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,329
Listen to me!

232
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,050
Listen to me.

233
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,940
Promise me one thing before entering the city.

234
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:27,569
After you go back,

235
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,190
don't act on impulse again.

236
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,230
Only when you stay composed can we survive

237
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:32,810
and can An people

238
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,530
have hope.

239
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:37,980
I swear.

240
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,360
♫My eyes are blazing and my armor is shimmering♫

241
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,280
♫I have feuds to settle♫

242
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,510
♫Who can lighten my darkness?♫

243
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,640
♫Who can see what I've been through?♫

244
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,150
Good.

245
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:49,930
Good.

246
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,390
Go.

247
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,000
Go!

248
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,900
♫Standing on the battlefield, I feel an overwhelming desire to win♫

249
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,030
♫This is when the tide turns♫

250
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,290
♫I chose this path myself♫

251
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,930
♫There's no turning back♫

252
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,800
♫Don't even dream about♫

253
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,590
♫Still manipulating me♫

254
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,600
♫What nonsense♫

255
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,610
♫I fall into the abyss♫

256
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:15,550
♫Only to soar through the sky♫

257
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,940
Fire Caltrops! Give them to me!

258
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,860
It's all used up!

259
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,600
♫They stab me in the back but I'll come back stronger♫

260
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,060
♫My roar shakes the ground when I wield my sword♫

261
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,310
♫They say I have no future but I'll rock the world♫

262
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,210
♫The sky is burning♫

263
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,850
♫There is no right or wrong♫

♫There is no right or wrong♫

265
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,630

266
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,840

267
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,200

Yuanzhou!

270
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,900
Pull him up now!

271
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:23,790
Shoot!

272
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,560
Hurry!

273
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,720
Comrades.

274
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,940
I'm sorry...

275
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:26,650

Although we've defended it this time,

I'm sorry.

331
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,420
You did nothing wrong.

332
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,780
Actually, I've wanted to kill Beipan's king long ago.

333
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:38,290
But I haven't found the right time.

334
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,610
The only thing you did wrong

335
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,120
was that you wanted to do it by yourself.

336
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:45,750
Have you forgotten

337
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,850
that I'm the State of An's best assassin?

338
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:49,810
Master.

We can't wait anymore.

342
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,230
At dawn,

343
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,400
Beipan people will come back with new weapons

344
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,690
to attack the city.

345
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:05,770
Li Tongguang.

346
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,300
You once told me

347
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,140
that my wish

348
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,740
is your command.

349
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,730
As the State of An's regent,

350
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:17,170
can you keep your word?

351
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:19,670
Yes.

352
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,920
Give me the State of An's national seal.

353
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,030
Okay.

354
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,090
I have the national seal and this.

355
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,420
It's enough.

356
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,960
Ruyi, you can't.

357
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,160
You can't take it too hard.

358
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,690
I'm just going to finish what Yuanzhou couldn't accomplished.

359
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,070
How's that taking it too hard?

360
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:07,930
Look.

361
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,970
It's snowing again.

362
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,510
[Beipan, Left Worthy Prince's tent]

363
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,710
The State of An's empress dowager and the new emperor

364
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,600
were kidnapped by Duke Qing, Li Tongguang.

365
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,190
It seems like the city is about to be destroyed.

366
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,960
The empress dowager doesn’t want to die.

367
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:46,060
But she's more afraid that Duke Qing would force her to die.

368
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,570
The empress dowager gave me 50 taels of gold

369
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,410
and secretly sent me out of the city.

370
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,320
She just wants to beg you

371
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,710
to spare her and her son's lives.

372
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:57,170
By the way,

373
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:58,910
the empress dowager

374
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,350
still has the State of An's imperial jade seal.

375
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,410
Really?

376
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,360
This is the hairpin when the State of An's empress was conferred the title.

377
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:23,880
The empress dowager said

378
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,170
to use this

379
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,590
to show her sincerity.

380
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:33,130
The empress dowager is only in her twenties.

381
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,020
So...

382
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,910
So, she's a stunning beauty.

383
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,910
The empress dowager knows that after surrendering to the north,

384
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,520
she'll probably have to enter the royal tent.

385
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:42,910
But the empress dowager

386
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,690
doesn't want to be with an old man like the king.

387
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:48,650
As long as you're willing to marry her as your legal wife,

388
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:49,870
the empress dowager said

389
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,810
she's willing to give you the national seal

390
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,210
and she'll strive to ensure her Shaxi tribe surrenders.

391
00:29:59,110 --> 00:29:59,930
Okay.

392
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,010
Okay.

393
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,690
At midnight,

394
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,470
I'll escort the empress dowager out of the city.

395
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,130
To avoid drawing Beipan king's attention,

396
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,840
I'd like to borrow some of Beipan's military uniforms for convenience.

397
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,640
Fortunately,

398
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,580
there are skilled tailors in this city.

399
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,700
Although we were pressed for time,

400
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,310
it was finally completed.

401
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,300
It’s fine.

402
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,050
It's enough to fool Beipan people.

403
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:38,840
Ying.

404
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,510
Lend me what Yuan Lu

405
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,600
gave you.

406
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,720
Ruyi, can you...

407
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,560
The wolf is Beipan people's totem.

408
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,740
But the young male wolves in the pack

409
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:27,130
never stop challenging the wolf king.

410
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:29,970
It's been a long time but He County hasn't been destroyed yet.

411
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,640
There's long been a rift between the father and son,

412
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,710
Beipan's king and the newly-appointed Left Worthy Prince.

413
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:38,420
If I can seize this opportunity

414
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:39,890
and succeed in one blow,

415
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,990
Beipan's army will be in chaos.

416
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,950
No matter when reinforcements from the State of Wu come,

417
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,250
you'll all have a chance of survival.

418
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:02,630
As for you two,

419
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,280
one's the wife of a duke,

420
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,250
and the other's the Female Leader of Shaxi.

421
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,200
You've to do your jobs well.

422
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,630
Don't let men look down on us.

423
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,180
Okay.

424
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:22,930
If I fail...

425
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,640
That's impossible.

426
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,740
Yuanzhou said

427
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,530
that you're

428
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:32,070
the best assassin in the world.

429
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,420
Exactly.

430
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:47,910
I'm the best assassin in the world.

431
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,990
I've never failed.

432
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:42,790
Master.

433
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,070
The comrades of Liudao Hall and Scarlet Guards

434
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,180
have disguised as Beipan soldiers.

435
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,500
They'll help you lure Beipan's nobles into the tent.

436
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,310
Get along well with Ying.

437
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,100
I know.

438
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,380
I'm the State of An's regent now.

439
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:00,100
I only shed blood,

440
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:02,950
and not tears.

441
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:11,760
Move aside.

442
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,850
Left Worthy Prince is colluding with
the State of An's empress dowager with an ulterior motive.

443
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,270
My lord. Wake up, my lord.

444
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,140
Something happened over there.

445
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,780
You want to rebel?

446
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,290
Father, let me explain.

447
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,220
I'm the State of An's empress dowager.

448
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:53,010
This is the State of An's national seal.

449
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:54,610
Whoever can save me

450
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,410
will get the national seal.

451
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,120
Arrest her!

452
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,830
You're an assassin?

453
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:16,790
Yes.

454
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,180
He's not the only one I want to kill.

455
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,430
I don't want to hear you

456
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:38,780
talk about mishaps anymore.

457
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:40,700
You told me

458
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,310
you'd be with me forever.

459
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,620
As long as I want to protect you,

460
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,410
I'll be able to protect you.

461
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,270
From now on,

462
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,320
I won't let you get hurt again.

463
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:53,630
I'll bustle around like shooting stars with you

464
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,340
and enjoy experiencing the world with you.

465
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,420
I know.

466
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,020

Yuanzhou.

474
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,990
You're gone.

475
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,340
It's too lonely for me...

476
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,060
in the world.

477
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:00,300
Kill!

478
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,710
In the first year of Tianyou,

479
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,830
the states of An and Wu fought Beipan in He County.

480
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:26,070
Duke Qing and his wife personally supervised the war.

481
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,620
There were massive bloodshed and corpses strewn everywhere.

482
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,940
Then the assassin Ren Ruyi,

483
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,040
with Scarlet Guards and Liudao Hall's members,

484
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:37,420
annihilated all Beipan nobles in the tent,

485
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:40,220
including Beipan king and the Left Worthy Prince.

486
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,040
Emperor Wurui led his army to provide reinforcement, and achieved a great victory

487
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:46,790
and chased Beipan outside of Tianmenguan.

488
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,070
My brother is here!

489
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,070
Ren Ruyi was posthumously conferred the title of Marquis Xuanping.

490
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:54,030
Since the war, Beipan has been in dire straits

491
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,860
and moved to the north,

492
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,850
never invading the south again.

493
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,170

Help theoretical acquisitions in a pleasant way.

498
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:23,990
Help theoretical acquisitions in a pleasant way.

499
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:26,550
It's always a pleasure to greet a friend...

500
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:30,550
It's always a pleasure to greet a friend...

501

Who's come from afar.

503
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:38,370
A person who isn't agitated by others' misjudgement about oneself...

504
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,650
A person who isn't agitated by others' misjudgement about oneself...

505
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:44,010
Is cultured and virtuous.

506
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,820

His Majesty wants you

516
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,720
to hurry back to the State of An for the monarch's coming-of-age ceremony.

517
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:14,830
Okay.

518
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,830
You guys go ahead. I'll take a walk by myself.

519
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:19,540
Yes.

520
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:36,020
Aunt, did I scare you?

521
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,290
I'm sorry.

522
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,110
Uncle Ding just gave me this horse.

523
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:42,710

531
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:12,910
I also have a sister.

Her name is Ren Lu.

533
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:15,790

551
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:49,450
My home is in the academy dozens of miles away.

552
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:50,270
Aunt.

553
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:51,590
Do you like drinking? Are you skilled with swords?

554
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:53,980
♫Swords drawn in the breezy snow loaded with immense joy♫

555
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:56,350
My father can make the best wine

556
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,680
and my mother can perform the best sword choreographies.

557
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,990
♫Invite the spring breeze to join me; drinking with the sword's gleam♫

558
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:01,740
If you like those things,

559
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:03,550
you'll get along.

560
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:04,790
♫Drowned countless sorrows♫

561
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:05,430
I like them.

562
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,960
We'll definitely get along well.

563
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:11,000
♫Spending half a lifetime drunk and miserable♫

564
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:18,210
♫Break free of the heart's confines and settle the grudges♫

565
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:22,270
♫The moon has set, and you have left♫

566
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:25,270
♫I've been stumbling on this journey to love♫

567
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:32,250
♫If this is somehow a game of fate, I'm glad to play it with you♫

568
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,670
♫You mended my broken heart and it beats for you now♫

569
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:36,840
Aunt, why are you crying?

570
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,470
♫I don't care what people will say♫

571
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:47,090
♫I don't mind being nobody as long as I'm somebody to you♫

572
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:51,060
♫Time flies but love remains♫

573
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,510
♫Who knows what the future will bring?♫

574
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:54,370
It's sunny and breezy here,

575
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:55,830
♫When the wind rises and the snow falls, it's your love that keeps me warm♫

576
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:56,980
with lush, green grass and birds in the air.

577
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:01,540
It's the most beautiful scenery

578
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:03,080
♫I'm in too deep to turn back♫

579
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,680
I've seen in my life.

580
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:08,750
♫What I want for us is a happy ever after♫

581
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:15,260
♫We're nobodies but this great love story will go down in history♫

582
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:18,270
Let's go.

583
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:19,990
Take me to your house to have some fun.

584
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:20,750
Okay.

585
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:38,330
[The End]
