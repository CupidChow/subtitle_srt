Ruyi.

5
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:58,630
Good. Very good.

6
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,400
-Ruyi.
-Ren Ruyi!

7
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,210
Your Highness!

8
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,560
Don't come over!

9
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:33,770
Go after them!

Ruyi.

11
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,840
Ruyi, don't fall asleep.

12
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,530
Back then, my mother died in her sleep.

13
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,780
I'm still alive.

14
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,510
Great.

15
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,579
I have some medicine that can heal wounds.

16
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,770
When I left, Qingyun gave it to me to save my life.

17
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,590
Why haven't you run away?

18
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,540
Aren't you afraid of death?

19
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,310
Because I believe you won't kill me.

20
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:15,790
Why?

21
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,130
I'm the best assassin in Scarlet Guards.

22
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,440
But...

23
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,070

35

and lanterns.

36
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,120
It's fine that you don't like these.

37
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,040
But His Majesty and Noble Consort have sent people here.

38
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,930
They asked when you will meet Marquis Changqing.

39
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,250
What's the hurry?

40
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,890
Tell them we'll talk about it in a few days.

41
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,030
Come on, let's drink.

42
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,909
Come on. Cheers.

43
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,830
I have something to do.

44
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,590
Go back first.

45
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,920
Who is this lady?

46
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,110
I don't know her.

47
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,610
You're finally here.

48
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,250
What happened?

49
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,230
We had a fight with Beauty.

50
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,420
She was injured.

51
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,890
She took Her Highness as a hostage and ran away.

52
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,190
I noticed the situation was unfavorable,

53
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,120
so I made a scene.

54
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,570
I told them bandits kidnapped Her Highness

55
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,170
and sent someone to inform you.

56
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,950
Except the two of them, you fought with her too?

57
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,390
She's a Scarlet Guard.

58
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,340
Qian sent us away on purpose.

59
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,659
It's not entirely your fault.

60
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,670
But the most important thing now is to find them.

61
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,000
Wait.

62
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,290
Someone is coming.

63
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:33,790

67
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:48,850
Why are you hurt?

68
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,900
It's not me. It's Ruyi.

69
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,440
She's badly injured.

70
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,500
She'll die soon. Go save her.

71
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,290
Hurry.

72
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,350
Okay, don't worry.

73
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,670
Shisan, take her back.

74
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,310
Okay.

75
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,550
Get me a horse.

76
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,830
If you want to save her, kill me first.

77
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,520
Empress Zhaojie. Empress Zhaojie.

78
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,740
Save me.

79
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,360
How can I save you?

80
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,620
You're badly injured.

81
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,790
Your two tendons are broken.

82
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,660
I will survive, Empress Zhaojie.

83
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,870
You have forgotten what I told you.

84
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,010
I told you

85
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,240
not to fall in love with a man easily.

86
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,490
You have forgotten everything.

87
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,850
It's a taboo for a killer to fall in love.

88
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,350
If you make a mistake,

89
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,780
you will die.

90
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:27,430
This time,

91
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,330
even I can't save you.

92
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,240
Empress Zhaojie.

93
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,220
Don't go.

94
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,330
I said I must go save her.

95
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,450
You've been blinded by Ren Ruyi.

96
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,270
But we haven't.

97
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,770
It's my utmost compassion

98
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,020
to let her die outside.

99
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,300
She never wanted to hide her identity.

100
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,890
I asked her to work with me.

101
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,210
So you knew she is a Scarlet Guard long ago.

102
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,550
I knew it long ago.

103
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,290
She is indeed the former Left Emissary of Scarlet Guards, Ren Xin.

104
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,490
But if she wants to harm us,

105
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:28,390
she would have done it long ago.

106
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,510
Why would she wait till now?

107
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,200
Besides, she has already betrayed and left Scarlet Guards.

108
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,850
And it's possible that she betrays us.

109
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,750
She won't.

110
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,990
What makes you so sure?

111
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,470
I guarantee with my life.

112
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,330
Have you forgotten

113
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,830
who fought side by side with us at Tianxing Gorge?

114
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,040
Is there such a foolish spy in this world?

115
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,140
So,

116
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,330
I trust her

117
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,210
as much as I trust you.

118
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,450
Today, I must save her no matter what.

119
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,130
If you want to stop me,

120
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:04,980
kill me first.

121
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,760
Boss, the tracker butterfly.

122
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,010
Ruyi!

123
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:39,270
Ruyi.

124
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,380
You're awake.

125
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,600
Don't move.

126
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,780
If we stop halfway, you'll die.

127
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,910
I'd rather die.

128
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,840
It's okay.

129
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,010
It's just the backfire of the internal force

130
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,800
as we suddenly stopped.

131
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,720
Come on.

132
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,660
Stop acting.

133
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,730
The night before last, you said those words to Yu Shisan on purpose

134
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,630
because you wanted me to hear it, right?

135
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,060
You're lying to me.

136
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,250
You're using me.

137
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,120
You made me trust you defencelessly.

138
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,880
What companions?

139
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,240
What trust?

140
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:46,540
Fake.

141
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,530
It's all fake.

142
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,710
I trust you.

143
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:53,950
I know you approached Scarlet Guards

144
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:54,970
to find out

145
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,370
who killed Ling Long.

146
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,100
Qian Zhao and the others just misunderstood you.

147
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,040
But I trust you. I really trust you.

148
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,580
I don't need your trust.

149
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,710
Ruyi, listen to me.

150
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,160
Calm down. Let me help you...

151
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,130
I am calm.

152
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,200
I'll kill you if you come any closer.

153
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,260
Fine.

154
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,080
Kill me.

155
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,290
Since you don't believe anything I say,

156
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,270
just kill me.

157
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:29,630
I told you.

158
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,220
You're my companion whom I can entrust my life to.

159
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,110
I will have no regrets even if you kill me.

160
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,810
Come on. Stab here.

161
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,090
Come on.

162
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,030
Kill me!

163
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:44,990
But no matter what happens today

164
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,170
and whether you're gonna kill me or not,

165
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,070
I will save you.

166
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,330
Don't come over. You are crazy.

167
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,550
I am crazy.

168
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,270
I've gone crazy when I saw you injured like this.

169
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,690
Do you really think I don't have the guts?

170
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,070
That's not what I think.

171
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,240
I just want to save you.

172
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,790
Even if I die in your hands,

173
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,970
I will have no regrets.

174
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,040
You're indeed the best assassin in Scarlet Guards.

175
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,220
You didn't stab my heart

176
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:13,930
or my lungs.

177
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,250
You bet on my professionalism.

178
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,950
I bet you don't have the heart.

179
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,230
Ruyi.

180
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,700
Ruyi.

181
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,200
Let me treat you.

182
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,220
It's useless.

183
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,050
I have internal injuries.

184
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:46,450
Listen to me.

185
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:47,750
Let me try.

186
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,080
Come on.

187
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,090
Come on.

188
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,010
What are you doing?

189
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:10,820
Don't move.

190
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,250
If we stop halfway,

191
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,690
we'll both get hurt.

192
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,270
I'm transmitting half of my internal force to you.

193
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:25,650
No need.

194
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,200
Even if you save me,

195
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,650
I won't go back with you.

196
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:35,730
I know.

197
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,330
I know you feel wronged.

198
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,570
I know you won't return to the delegation again.

199
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,490
But I just want to save you.

200
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,720
I also know

201
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,530
we may never meet again.

202
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,330
But I still hope

203
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,500
you can live happily and safely.

204
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,270
Find a man

205
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,250
who deserves your love.

206
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,530
And have a child of your own.

207
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,320
Leave.

208
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,960
I order you to go to a new place

209
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,470
and live happily and safely for me.

210
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:20,880
In this life,

211
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,270
don't easily fall in love with a man.

212
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,390
But

213
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,710
you must have a child of your own.

214
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,450
Shisan and the others

215
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,650
must think I'm crazy.

216
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,110
But I'm not the chief of Liudao Hall now.

217
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,160
I'm just Ning Yuanzhou.

218
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:01,970
Don't be sad.

219
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,210
It's just my wounds hurt too much.

220
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:10,900
I know.

221
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:14,880
Fool.

222
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,990
I'm not talking about you.

223
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,190
I'm talking about myself.

224
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,350
I know that too.

225
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,510
It smells so good. I can smell it even though it's in the jar.

226
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,440
Pear Blossom Wine is Yuzhou's specialty.

227
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,430
His Majesty summoned me this morning.

228
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,880
Maybe he thinks he's been cold to me for long enough.

229
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,280
So he's ready to let me lead an army officially.

230
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,340
I'm bringing him a jar of good wine

231
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,870
in hopes of getting closer to my target of ending wars.

232
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,250
There is something wrong with these people. Be careful.

233
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:26,970
Stop.

234
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,250
I was just drinking here.

235
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,970
Who are you to judge?

236
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,250
Teach him a lesson.

237
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,340
These people obviously came prepared.

238
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,450
Then don't show mercy.

239
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:10,750
Retreat.

240
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,370
Who ordered you to do this?

241
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,660
You won't tell me?

242
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,730
Show him what you are capable of

243
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,250
and persuade him.

244
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,100
Yes.

245
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,620
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

246
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,930
It's Princess Jin Ming who sent us here.

247
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,260
I knew it.

248
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,320
Why does Princess Jin Ming have a grudge against you?

249
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,420
Last year on the Dragon Boat Festival,

250
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,310
in order to please His Majesty,

251
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,580
I disguised myself as a civilian of Shazhong Tribe

252
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,510
and took her ball at the horse racing party.

253
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:50,910
And a few days ago,

254
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,490
I punished some people of Shaxi Tribe.

255
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,190
What should we do with them?

256
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:00,680
Tie them up

257
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,080
and take them to my tent first.

258
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:03,830
Okay.

259
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:09,910
Where are we going?

260
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,530
Let me keep you in suspense.

261
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,790
You'll know later.

262
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,450
Greetings, Your Highness.

263
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:22,030
Tongguang, you came at the right time.

264
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,140
This is the niece of Noble Consort

265
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,470
and the daughter of Duke Chu.

266
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,180
She's Chu Yue, Princess Jin Ming.

267
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,670
She's your cousin to some extent.

268
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,450
The weather is nice today.

269
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,160
Do you want to join us in horse racing?

270
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,270
Cousin?

271
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,220
I didn't see that.

272
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,910
His Majesty wants to see me. Excuse me.

273
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,790
Yue, don't take it to heart.

274
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,170
That's how he is.

275
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,140
Him?

276
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,230
He is not worthy.

277
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:12,240
What do you think of his talent and appearance?

278
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,670
Is there any misunderstanding between you two?

279
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:20,920
It's not a misunderstanding.

280
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,050
It's a grudge.

281
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,520
Let's go.

282
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,850
Wait.

283
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,980
Noble Consort specially asked me

284
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:28,090
to take this route with you,

285
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,230
so that you can

286
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,190
meet each other first.

287
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,610
Why do you have a grudge?

288
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,110
Why should I meet him first?

289
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,000
You have been bestowed a marriage by His Majesty, right?

290
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,740
Isn't he just a Yulin guard?

291
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,350
His Majesty said he would bestow a marriage

292
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,690
to Marquis Changqing on me.

293
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,710
The title His Majesty gave Tongguang

294
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,130
is Marquis Changqing.

295
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:54,870
A marriage?

296
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,170
What? You don't agree?

297
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:58,700
I dare not.

298
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:00,940
I'm just surprised.

299
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,870
After all, a noble lady like Princess Jin Ming

300
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,730
is good enough to be the crown princess.

301
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,140
How could she be interested in me?

302
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,570
I know your father's family is not upper-class.

303
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:13,190
That's why I want you

304
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,250
to marry someone from a powerful family.

305
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:19,760
Princess Jin Ming?

306
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,830
But didn't she just ask someone to...

307
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,710
No need to say more.

308
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,090
I can't disobey His Majesty's order.

309
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,110
But...

310
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,270
I dislike her.

311
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,340
She wants to kill me.

312
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,510
Apart from these two aspects,

313
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,890
I can benefit a lot from being the son-in-law of Duke Chu.

314
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,000
Looks like the old man wants to use me again.

315
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,790
That's why he's investing heavily.

316
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,870
After getting 100,000 taels of gold from the State of Wu,

317
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,010
he wants a war again.

318
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,050
Our emperor

319
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,130
always likes wars of injustice.

320
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,630
You can have military power.

321
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,850
Isn't it a good thing for you?

322
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,180
Due to the Tianmenguan Battle,

323
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,620
a lot of manpower and money are needed.

324
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,610
And the old man wants to loot other states.

325
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,670
The civilians at the border

326
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:04,950
will suffer again.

327
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,170
Congratulations, Marquis Changqing.

328
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,210
In the future,

329
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,520
we'll be family.

330
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,670
You must be very satisfied

331
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,980
and happy

332
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,620
with this marriage.

333
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,710
You're right.

334
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,350
It's the grace of His Majesty.

335
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,200
I'm very grateful.

you can live happily and safely.

374
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,210
Find a man

375
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,660
who deserves your love.

376
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,410
And have a child of your own.

377
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:02,220
♫The dream lingers for a while♫

378
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:05,930
♫Teardrops fall onto the robe after the farewell♫

♫Two passionate hearts staying together forever♫

381

♫Who will drink with me half a lifetime's wind and frost♫

383
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,600
a secret file about Empress Zhaojie will be put

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,950
on the beam of Wofo Temple in An Capital.

385
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:21,070
♫Exchange myself for a sliver of light♫

386
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,130
I hope you are healthy

and live a worry-free life.

388
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,470
♫If love does exist♫

389
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:28,690
♫Let's look back in our next life♫

390
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,130
She's still alive.

391
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,110
Boss Ning,

392
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:02,400
I have never disobeyed

393
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,310
the orders you gave.

394
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:06,120
But this time,

395
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:07,820
I don't understand you.

396
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,400
I didn't have your permission. So I didn't say anything.

397
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,630
Give me an explanation.

398
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:25,800
First,

399
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:29,300
Ruyi is indeed the former Left Emissary of Scarlet Guards, Ren Xin.

400
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,100
But 5 years ago,

401
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:33,330
she was framed and had to fake her death and leave.

402
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:35,710
Second,

403
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:37,930
I asked her to cooperate with me.

404
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,930
She teaches Her Highness everything about the State of An.

405
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,180
I help her take revenge.

406
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:44,350
Third,

407
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,810
I have repeatedly verified it.

408
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,690
She did kill a few people of Liudao Hall.

409
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,680
But they were Zhao Ji's henchmen.

410
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,330
There is no grudge between her

411
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,410
and anyone in the delegation.

412
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,590
Whether it's Liudao Hall

413
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:02,790
or Scarlet Guards,

414
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,970
we all are tools of those powerful people.

415
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,940
There are many things in which we can't follow our heart.

416
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,230
You should know that.

417
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:11,610
Fourth,

418
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,050
she disguised herself as a Scarlet Guard of Tianji Branch

419
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,550
just to find out where her enemy is.

420
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:19,450
She didn't tell anyone anything about the delegation.

421
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,720
She was a Scarlet Guard.

422
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,910
Why did she disguise herself as a Scarlet Guard?

423
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:27,880
You want me to let it go just because you said there is no grudge between us?

424
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,650
Sun Lang's father,

425
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:32,450
Chai Ming,

426
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,710
and those brothers of the Paths.

427
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:38,260
Have you calculated

428
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,690
how many people were killed by An people?

429
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,310
She is not from the State of An.

430
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,200
She was sold to Scarlet Guards back then.

431
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,210
She had no choice.

432
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,520
It's the fate of a spy to serve his own master.

433
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,590
Have we never killed the people of Scarlet Guards?

434
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,190
Scarlet Guards stole the military information.

435
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:01,590
On the battlefield at Tianmenguan,

436
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,730
thousands of soldiers died.

437
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,270
If they didn't spread the rumor to frame us,

438
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,710
Chai Ming wouldn't have been considered a traitor

439
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,360
after his death.

440
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,420
Was it Scarlet Guards that got them killed?

441
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,960
Wasn't it Eunuch Hu who sold the military information?

442
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,250
If His Majesty hadn't listened to slanders

443
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,110
and fought the enemy rashly,

444
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,750
they wouldn't have ended up like this, right?

445
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,990
I can't believe you're questioning His Majesty for her.

446
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,130
Yes.

447
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,910
I'm a member of Liudao Hall.

448
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,950
His Majesty is my master.

449
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,700
But in my heart,

450
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,870
the lives of civilians, brothers, and friends

451
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,590
are more important than his life.

452
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:44,160
Besides, Ruyi has nothing to do with any of this.

453
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,440
You're so obsessed with Ren Ruyi

454
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,700
that you have even forgotten which side you are on.

455
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,130
We've been brothers for years.

456
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,790
Am I a man

457
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,300
who can be easily fascinated by someone

458
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,810
and who can't tell right from wrong?

459
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:09,449
Tell me.

460
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:10,790
Am I?

461
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:31,120
If Ruyi really wanted to harm us,

462
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,659
she would have done it long ago.

463
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,350
Qian Zhao,

464
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,530
have you forgotten

465
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:38,820
she saved you at Tianxing Gorge?

466
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,179
She saved all of us.

467
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:43,840
Sun Lang,

468
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,150
who took Her Highness back

469
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:47,929
when we were given sleeping drugs?

470
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:52,070
Shisan,

471
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:54,920
who went to Qingjing Mountain with you

472
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:56,460
and caught a poisonous snake to save Yuan Lu?

473
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,250
So tell me.

474
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:03,620
She risked her life to help the delegation.

475
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,810
Why can't I save her?

476
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,160
Why can't I help her?

477
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:09,610
She is a person

478
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,260
who doesn't trust others easily.

479
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:13,920
But because of you,

480
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,630
you, and you,

481
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:17,120
she's willing to trust you

482
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,360
and take you as her companions.

483
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,680
But you tried to kill her.

484
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,330
Do you know how sad

485
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:22,250
and how painful she is?

486
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:30,100
Is this what the members of Liudao Hall should do?

487
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:31,680
Huh?

488
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,110
Mr. Du.

489
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:54,490
I'm going to check on him.

490
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:06,260
Don't argue with Qian.

491
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,020
I thought

492
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,050
he was not very close to us

493
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,040
since he left Heaven Path long ago.

494
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,560
He was drunk last night.

495
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,560
That's when I found out

496
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,300
he has always regarded Chai Ming and the others

497
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,120
as his biological brothers.

498
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,870
But he's very deep

499
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,620
and he always gives a cold face.

500
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:24,810
He keeps everything in his heart

501
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,840
and never tells anyone.

502
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:28,730
I know.

503
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,080
I decided to go to the State of An

504
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,510
in order to clear the names of Chai Ming and the others.

505
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,840
Give Qian some more time.

506
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,430
I believe he will figure it out.

507
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:40,260
By the way,

508
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,300
it was quite a scene yesterday.

509
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:43,910
How did you deal with An people?

510
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,180
Don't worry.

511
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:47,270
People outside think bandits

512
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:48,210
suddenly attacked the delegation.

513
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,720
Now except the members of the caravan,

514
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,230
most of the people in the delegation

515
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:53,180
don't know that Beauty is a Scarlet Guard.

516
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:56,500
Chief Clerk Du went directly to Shentu Chi,

517
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,630
insisting that he was behind this

518
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,340
and he kidnapped Her Highness to sabotage the peace talk between the two states.

519
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:02,750
After hearing that,

520
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,110
Shentu Chi changed his attitude immediately.

521
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,740
He swore that he has nothing to do with it

522
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:07,870
and sent someone to serve Her Highness.

523
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,750
He said he would come to visit Her Highness in person later.

524
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:12,350
Now,

525
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,870
he's probably investigating the bandits we fabricated.

526
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:16,390
Good.

527
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,060
Let them investigate then.

528
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,890
There must be a spy

529
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,110
among the maids sent by An people.

530
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:23,490
Shisan,

531
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,810
this is the human skin mask

532
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:26,550
Ruyi used when she met with Scarlet Guards.

533
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,470
Find a fake corpse later.

534
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,660
Put the mask on his face

535
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,650
and send it to the crematory.

536
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:31,710
Okay.

537
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,040
Yuan Lu.

538
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:36,110
Later, you disguise yourself as Ruyi

539
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:36,940
and go out to walk around.

540
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,350
Then the spy will think

541
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,810
the person who met with her is dead

542
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,340
and won't suspect Ruyi's identity.

543
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,000
Okay.

544
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:45,170
Do you think

545
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,470
we can see Beauty again?

546
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,510
She has 3 fatal wounds.

547
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,870
I used up my internal force to keep her alive.

548
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:57,740
What do you think?

549
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,430
Ruyi must be sad now.

550
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,640
When we were having mutton together last time,

551
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,070
she was so happy and danced with us.

552
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:15,530
But now...

553
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,480
I'm going to check on Her Highness.

554
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:38,930
I didn't sleep last night.

555
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,790
I wonder where Ruyi is now

556
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,840
and if her wounds have healed.

557
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:45,530
Mr. Du,

558
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,410
without Ruyi,

559
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:48,890
what should I do in the future?

560
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:51,050
I need to meet Shentu Chi later.

561
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:52,590
I'm worried that I might give myself away.

562
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:55,630
Your Highness,

563
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,930
you should have faith in yourself.

564
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,210
After what happened last night,

565
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,650
you can still remain calm.

566
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:06,330
Meeting Shentu Chi is just a piece of cake.

567
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:07,990
Fine.

568
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:10,690
Your Highness,

569
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,150
I have a request.

570
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:17,690
I know you hate Shentu Chi.

571
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,970
But when you see him later,

572
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:21,690
if he offers you an invitation,

573
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,410
like going to a banquet,

574
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,110
you must promise him

575
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:27,250
as long as I'm not against it.

576
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,040
Why?

577
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,480
The diplomatic relations between 2 states

578
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,960
depend on not only power,

579
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,480
but also strength.

580
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,730
Our state was defeated by the State of An.

581
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,710
We have been outshone in terms of power.

582
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,630
That's why Shentu Chi was so arrogant before.

583
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:51,940
But now he wants to visit you.

584
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,400
He just wants to test your reaction.

585
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,220
I see.

586
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,870
I need to let An people know that I'm not a coward.

587
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:04,730
And maybe it'll be more convenient for the delegation to do things in the future.

588
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,650
Your Highness, you are so smart.

589
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,880
No offense.

590
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:13,650
When we just set off,

591
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,090
I doubted whether you are competent enough

592
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,230
to be the emperor's envoy.

593
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,630
But I can see

594
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,720
you've become better after everything that has happened.

595
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:23,360
You are indeed the daughter of the late emperor.

596
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:24,140
Really?

597
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:26,380
I dare not lie to you.

598
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:29,450
Your Highness,

599
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:33,790
Mr. Ning asked Miss Ren to be your teacher.

600
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:36,400
He's really flexible

601
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,850
and wise.

602
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,900
But I didn't expect

603
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,640
that Miss Ren is...

604
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:54,530
There is something I don't understand.

605
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,990
After knowing

606
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:00,170
Ruyi was the Left Emissary of Scarlet Guards,

607
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,400
why are you not as angry as Qian and the others?

608
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:06,250
On the contrary, you spoke highly of her.

609
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:11,920
Because I always remember what the late emperor said.

610
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,470
We shouldn't judge a person

611
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:15,710
based on where he comes from,

612
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:18,220
but what he says and does

613
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:20,580
and what he can do for civilians.

614
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:26,280
Miss Ren risked her life

615
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:27,980
for the delegation along the way.

616
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,820
That's exactly why

617
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:31,830
I believe her sincerity for you

618
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:33,430
and the delegation.

619
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,450
Thank you for telling me this, Mr. Du.

620
00:41:59,400 --> 00:41:59,970
This

621
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,030
was found in the yard.

622
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,100
When Ruyi was injured,

623
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,790
she said something in a daze.

624
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:09,470
But I can tell

625
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,930
this is for you.

626
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,750
Shisan told me about what happened between you.

627
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:22,490
I think she

628
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,600
wanted to apologize to you with this candy rabbit.

629
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:30,930
Did she hit me

630
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,750
because she's a Scarlet Guard?

631
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:34,920
No.

632
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,080
Because Empress Zhaojie is someone she respects very much.

633
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:39,980
Their relationship

634
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:43,290
is like the relationship between me and Yuan Lu.

635
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,410
I shouldn't have cursed Empress Zhaojie.

636
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,080
Yuanzhou,

637
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:55,060
Chief Clerk Du taught me a lot just now.

638
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,650
I think I understand a few things.

639
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:57,750
But

640
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,330
I still don't know

641
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:02,370
whose fault

642
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:04,410
it is.

643
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,470
Actually, it's no one's fault.

644
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,520
It's just fate.

645
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:13,730
But

646
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,030
you just need to remember that Ruyi is very nice to you.

647
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:18,810
That's enough.

648
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:26,410
Your Highness,

649
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:28,080
Shentu Chi is waiting outside.

650
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,730
The people of the delegation are also waiting outside.

651
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:30,880
Okay.

652
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,230
I'll go now.

653
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,680
It's inconvenient for me to go with you.

654
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,610
But Shisan and Qian Zhao will protect you.

655
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:08,270
I'm not afraid.

656
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:10,350
I will deal with Shentu Chi properly.

657
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:12,200
Only in this way

658
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:14,860
can I be worthy of what Ruyi taught me.

659
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:18,510
And that candy rabbit.

660
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:24,850
Okay, go.

661
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:41,190
Boss.

662
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:45,310
Boss, are you okay?

663
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:46,550
I'm fine.

664
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,150
I used up my internal force.

665
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:51,590
And I got hurt when I went to save Ruyi.

666
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:54,030
I feel much better after spitting out stagnant blood.

667
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:56,760
I'm going to ask Qian to get you some medicine.

668
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:57,510
Come back.

669
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:00,060
They are dealing with An people there.

670
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,260
We can't let them find out about us.

671
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:02,570
But you...

672
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:03,190
I'm fine.

673
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,150
Clean up the blood later.

674
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:06,090
Don't make them worried.

675
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:09,290
Don't worry.
