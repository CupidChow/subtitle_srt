00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,770
[Guideyuan, the State of An]

5
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,910
Bastard!

00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,070
[Jia Ling, Scarlet Guard Right Emissary]

7
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,390
You are incompetent.

8
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,250
You just want to flatter officials, right?

9
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,070
Commander Jiang likes this type.

10
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,780
Unfortunately, he's dead.

11
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,210
Lord, please forgive me.

12
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,030
The Scarlet Guards have always been good at seduction.

13
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,970
A seductive woman like you

14
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,440
could have been successful like fish in the water,

15
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,070
but since His Majesty assigned me to take charge of the Scarlet Guards,

16
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,060
don't even think about doing this anymore.

17
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,579
You have seven days

18
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,340
to investigate the delegation.

19
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:41,190
Otherwise,

20
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,260
you won't be the Right Emissary

21
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,030
of the Scarlet Guards anymore.

22
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,540
Yes.

23
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,390
My Lord.

00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,310
[Zhu Ji, Jia Ling's trusted Red Emissary]

25
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,440
Did Commander Deng do this?

26
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:12,940
Lord.

27
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,010
Why did His Majesty send him to manage us?

28
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,970
Is he afraid that the Scarlet Guards are too powerful?

29
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,579
His father was killed by White Sparrows.

30
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,520
That's why he hates the Scarlet Guards.

31
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,390
He also believes that all female Scarlet Guards deserve to die.

32
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,520
Let's not talk about this anymore.

33
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,420
Why is there still no news from Yue Sanniang?

34
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:40,730
I...

35
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,530
I'm afraid...

36
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,860
Something has happened to her.

37
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,370
We didn't find Yue Sanniang's body.

38
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,180
At the site of the accident,

39
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,590
we only found two Scarlet Guards that hadn't been killed.

40
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,630
They all claimed that Ruyi was the one who did it.

41
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,860
We found Yu's body,

42
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,090
but

43
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,270
it was devoured by fish.

44
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,540
It's unclear where he was injured.

45
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,740
It was a clean kill.

46
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,290
The killer is an expert.

47
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:16,800
Lord, look.

48
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:21,339
According to the two people's testimonies,

49
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,650
Yue Sanniang once said

50
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,250
Ruyi is Ren Xin's Left Emissary.

51
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:24,790
Shut up!

52
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,540
His Majesty forbade mentioning that name.

53
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,360
Have you forgotten?

54
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,060
Yes.

55
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
It can't be her.

56
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,750
Although there was a fire in the imperial prison

57
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,909
and her trusted subordinates dug out her body,

58
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,110
a part of her tibia remained.

59
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,240
I checked it myself.

60
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,300
There were nail marks on the bone.

61
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,990
They were exactly the same as the nail torture

62
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,730
she suffered in the State of Chu.

63
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,600
It doesn't seem to be done by the Liudao Hall.

64
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,800
The State of Wu just had a great defeat.

65
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,710
I’m afraid Zhao Ji is already busy enough.

66
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,870
Using gunpowder like this

67
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,540
is not his method either.

68
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,110
The Qibuzui used by the police officers?

69
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,990
So,

70
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,890
Ruyi is a police officer in disguise.

71
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,050
She knew Yue Sanniang would carry a lot of gold with her,

72
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,250
so she became greedy

73
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,880
and used that name to threaten the Scarlet Guards?

74
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,330
Send my order immediately.

75
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,050
Tell the Yuheng Branch to dispatch everyone

76
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,640
to investigate the police officers and Yue Sanniang.

77
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,780
Also, mobilize the Jumen and Lianzhen departments

78
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,840
to investigate the background of the Wu delegation.

79
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,440
Yes.

80
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,200
Chief.

81
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,710
You've recovered well.

82
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,250
Thank you for inviting a famous physician

83
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,830
to treat my shoulder blade.

84
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,330
You know her?

85
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,150
Red Emissary Zhu Ji,

86
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,880
the trusted aide of Right Emissary Jia Ling.

87
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,880
His Majesty will return to the capital in three days.

88
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,130
The direction they are heading now

89
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,470
is the State of Wu.

90
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:13,810
That's right.

91
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,320
It's been days since the Wu delegation departed.

92
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,470
Aren’t you close to

93
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,650
the emperor of Wu?

94
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,960
Why don't you visit him more often these days?

95
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:25,870
When the delegation comes,

96
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,010
His Majesty will definitely assign another task.

97
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,790
Even if it's just a reception,

98
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,300
it's better than being idle like this.

99
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,110
I have a task right now.

100
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,470
I'm still in charge of the Yulin Army in name.

101
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,000
His Majesty wants me to be idle,

102
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,120
so I can only be idle.

103
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,040
The day he thinks I'm calm enough

104
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,890
and can be useful

105
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,630
will be my chance.

106
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,540
Before one takes action,

107
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,580
one must endure more than anyone else.

108
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,090
When one takes action,

109
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,020
one must be crueler than everyone else.

110
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,320
This is what the Lord used to say.

111
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,600
You still remember it.

112
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,120
Yes.

113
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,290
I've never forgotten it.

114
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,400
Contact our informant immediately.

115
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,390
I want to know

116
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,799
how often Marquis Changqing entered the palace before he left the capital

117
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:36,559
and what is between him and Noble Consort Chu.

118
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:37,289
Yes.

119
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:37,860
Go.

120
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,660
Soldiers, you worked hard in Tianxing Gorge yesterday.

121
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,560
Let's eat and drink freely today.

122
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:49,940
We'll continue our journey tomorrow.

123
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,130
You've worked hard.

124
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,130
Thank you, Mr. Du.

125
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,810
Eat up.

126
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,830
You've worked hard.

127
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,530
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Mr. Du.

128
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,050
Thank you.

129
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,220
Thank you, my lord.

130
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,790
Enjoy yourselves.

131
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,290
Okay, Mr. Du.

132
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:06,930
Thank you.

133
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,050
Eat more and drink more.

134
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,640
Thank you.

135
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,250
Cheers.

136
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,000
Cheers.

137
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,080
Drink up.

138
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,920
Mr. Du.

139
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,280
Have a drink.

140
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,400
-Come on.
-Drink it.

141
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,410
Come on.

142
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,180
The higher-ups must celebrate with the people,

143
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,520
but you can't do it all the time.

144
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,160
When the lamb is cooked,

145
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,340
you can have some fun.

146
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,250
Fill it up.

147
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,900
Bring my personal savings over

148
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,760
and buy 20 more jars of good wine to reward everyone.

149
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,820
Thank you, Your Highness.

150
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,030
Cheers.

151
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,230
Thank you.

152
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,940
Come on.

153
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,660
Originally, I only wanted you

154
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,360
to teach her some political affairs of the State of An.

155
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:00,940
I didn't expect

156
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:02,810
that you're also teaching her

157
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,340
how to be a true emperor.

158
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,450
I've taught subordinates before.

159
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,910
Since you appreciate my help,

160
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,510
you should work harder

161
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:11,930
for my matter in the future.

162
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,270
Great!

163
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,090
One more.

164
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,740
Come on.

165
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,870
Bravo! Bravo!

166
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,570
Awesome.

167
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,180
Give me a bowl too.

168
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,530
It's not fun enough to drink with a bowl.

169
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,700
You need to use a jug.

170
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,680
Come on, Beauty.

171
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:38,480
Cheers.

172
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,650
Bravo! Bravo!

173
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,640
Bravo!

174
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,450
Awesome.

175
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,490
Yu.

176
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:20,430
Bravo!

177
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,060
Yu.

178
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:22,530
Come on.

179
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,320
Come on.

180
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:24,540
Come on.

181
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,830
Come on.

182
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,810
Shisan, come on.

183
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,570
Come on.

184
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,510
Shisan, come on.

185
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:33,040
Come.

186
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:33,890
Shisan.

187
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:34,410
Good.

188
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,590
Come on.

189
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,720
Bravo! Bravo!

190
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,200
Oh my.

191
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,850
Bravo!

192
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,720
Bravo!

193
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,000
Bravo!

194
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,250
Bravo!

195
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:59,240
Great! Great!

196
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:03,070
Bravo!

197
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,040
Bravo!

198
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,090
He's looking at you.

199
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,100
Miss Ruyi.

200
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:07,770
Great.

201
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:08,290
Miss Ruyi.

202
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,190
Go, go.

203
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:09,830
Come on.

204
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,310
Come on.

205
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,220
Ruyi, come on.

206
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,620
Bravo!

207
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:28,870
Bravo!

208
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,970
Bravo!

209
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:46,460
Bravo!

210
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,340
Bravo!

211
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,960
Bravo! Bravo!

212
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,370
Bravo!

213
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,860
Bravo!

214
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,430
Bravo!

215
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:06,230
Bravo!

216
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,010
Bravo!

217
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,350
Bravo!

218
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,190
Ruyi,

219
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,310
you're so beautiful!

220
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,580
Bravo!

221
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,160
Bravo!

222
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,730
Great!

223
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,200
So nice.

224
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,000
See?

225
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,470
I didn't take the initiative.

226
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,790
I purposely led the horse away yesterday

227
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,890
to give you two some alone time.

228
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:57,870
Why is it like this now?

229
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,550
You couldn't handle it?

230
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,140
It's not your fault.

231
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,650
Maybe I'm too charming

232
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,780
or Beauty saw clearly—

233
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:04,870
Shut up.

234
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,070
Is everything okay?

235
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,730
Yes.

236
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,270
How are you?

237
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:11,470
Delicious.

238
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,340
Don't drink.

239
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,000
Okay.

240
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,630
Yuanzhou.

241
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,710
You guys, drink.

242
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,030
Is it that delicious?

243
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,050
Yuan Lu is here.

244
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,930
Are you feeling better, Yuan Lu?

245
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,120
Much better.

246
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,820
Don't worry.

247
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:21,830
Yuan Lu,

248
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,820
you just recovered. You can't drink.

249
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,050
You can eat something though.

250
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,160
Eat something.

251
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,660
Okay, got it.

252
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:29,870
Yuan Lu, have a seat.

253
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:31,670
Ruyi.

254
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,580
Let's go there and watch them roast the lamb.

255
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,380
Drink it.

256
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:38,780
I'll cover for you.

257
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,770
Why?

258
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,890
I feel that you don't like

259
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,410
others' care and concern.

260
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,920
You don't want others to treat you as an invalid.

261
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,630
You just want to eat and drink freely

262
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,700
like an ordinary person.

263
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:55,990
That's right.

264
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,540
That's what I thought since I was young.

265
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,230
As long as I can breathe, I should eat and drink like normal.

266
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,300
It's nothing.

267
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,730
Every additional day I live is a win.

268
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,010
You're still young.

269
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,950
Don't talk like that.

270
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,910
I've experienced more

271
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,070
life or death situations than the wine you've drunk.

272
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,570
But I'm better than all of you

273
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,580
in how much I know about Boss Ning.

274
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:21,850
Ruyi,

275
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,840
I saw you there just now.

276
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,410
Were you trying to make him jealous?

277
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,310
You used to be direct to him,

278
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,440
but he rejected you,

279
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,390
so you wanted to change your method.

280
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,160
On the surface, you're not forcing him anymore.

281
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,930
In reality, you want to make him jealous,

282
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,220
right?

283
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,570
Do you think

284
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,910
there's a big chance of success?

285
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,050
No way.

286
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,690
Boss Ning has seen this trick too many times.

287
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,470
Many noble ladies used to do this to him.

288
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,890
For our sake,

289
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,960
I’ll be honest with you.

290
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,440
Boss Ning

291
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,830
is stubborn but soft-hearted.

292
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,040
He can't hold up against persistence.

293
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,810
He didn't like me before,

294
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,770
so I just clung to his leg and refused to let go.

295
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,930
I didn't care

296
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,370
and now, he has accepted me.

297
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:09,870
He's the type

298
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,270
that can't stand others being nice to him silently.

299
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,190
So, you have to pluck his heartstrings,

300
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,200
follow his wishes,

301
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,590
and get along with him slowly.

302
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,600
He likes sweets,

303
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,370
but he never says that he wants it.

304
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,070
He likes carving in private.

305
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,300
If you ask him for one, he definitely won't give it to you,

306
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,210
but he'd feel happy inside.

307
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,700
Ruyi,

308
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,730
you have a chance.

309
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,270
Shisan.

310
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,450
Why didn't you bring me along?

311
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,960
Come here.

312
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,800
-The lamb smells so good.
-Your Highness.

313
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,650
Go dance.

314
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,130
I'm not good at dancing.

315
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,360
Let’s go dance.

316
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,420
-I can’t dance.
-Let’s go.

317
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,360
Let’s go.

318
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,190
Your Highness, come on.

319
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,730
Come on, Ruyi.

320
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,090
It's done.

321
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,540
I haven't seen Boss Ning so happy in a long time.

322
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,350
Look.

323
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,780
Look how well Miss Ruyi dances.

324
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,730
Is this the Butterfly Dance?

325
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,340
It seems to be.

326
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,600
Give me one.

327
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:15,840
Try it.

328
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,580
It's roasted very well.

329
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,330
It's done?

330
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:21,870
Try it.

331
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:22,890
Give me a piece.

332
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,350
It's delicious.

333
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,620
I'm telling you,

334
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,490
Qian is a great cook.

335
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,370
Mr. Du, here.

336
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,250
Your Highness, let me tell you a secret.

337
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,120
Imperial Chef Wang once even wanted

338
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,100
to take Qian as his assistant.

339
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,230
Qian, is that true?

340
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,650
You know so much.

341
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,580
You can check one's pulse, prescribe medicine,

342
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,550
carve stamps, and now, you can even cook.

343
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,710
Is there anything you can't do?

344
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,730
Yes.

345
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:51,710
What?

346
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,910
Giving birth.

347
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,320
This piece has cornel. Can you eat it?

348
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,510
Please give me another piece.

349
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,140
Here.

350
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,760
Move it over there.

351
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,920
Slow down.

352
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,880
Be careful.

353
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:33,370
Ding Hui.

354
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:33,950
Yes.

355
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,450
Sun Lang.

356
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,460
The Scarlet Guards are more powerful around here.

357
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,210
You must be more careful during the night patrol.

358
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:41,630
Don't worry.

359
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:42,010
Yes.

360
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,230
Come with me.

361
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,660
I have something good for you.

362
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:47,610
Take it.

363
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,220
I bought the red bean paste bun in the alley last time,

364
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,890
but this time, I borrowed

365
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,290
Qian's fire and personally baked the naan.

366
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,010
There's honey inside.

367
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:57,770
Be careful. It's hot.

368
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,790
What does she want?

369
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,230
What else?

370
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,570
She's obviously being nice to you.

371
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,990
Others might not know, but I know.

372
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,850
She's protecting your dignity.

373
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,850
She's worried being too direct would scare you,

374
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,530
so she decided to play around

375
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,570
with us irrelevant people

376
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:40,760
before treating you well.

377
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,140
This is called "going in a roundabout way

378
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,430
and biding one's time."

379
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,670
Anyway, keep an eye on her for me.

380
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,920
I can keep an eye on her for you,

381
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,680
but are you sure you won't be jealous?

382
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,590
Our mission this time is not romantic.

383
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,970
We're escorting Her Highness to the State of An

384
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,210
and bring His Majesty back

385
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,650
to clear the name of the Heaven Path brothers.

386
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:01,910
Yes.

387
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,280
Everyone had a great fight with her

388
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,130
in the battle at Tianxing Gorge.

389
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,710
She treats Yuan Lu well too.

390
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,770
So...

391
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,770
She is great,

392
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,750
but she's not one of us.

393
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:13,590
You reminded me

394
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,410
that Chu's police officers and the Liudao Hall

395
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,710
have had quite a few grudges.

396
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,120
If you really fell in love with her

397
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,060
and her identity was exposed one day,

398
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,080
our men would still make trouble.

399
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,860
No wonder you refused

400
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,250
such a good thing.

401
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,110
You're indeed the chief.

402
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,530
You're foresighted.

403
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:31,930
Alright.

404
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,510
Anyway, don't let her know about this.

405
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,140
You're worried they'll be sad

406
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,750
if they find out, but you still do it.

407
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,670
I would be sad too.

408
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:42,920
Ning,

409
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,530
don't do this again

410
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,860
when you meet a girl you like in the future.

411
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,670
Once the girl's heart is broken,

412
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,330
it'll become riddled with holes

413
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,760
and you'll never be able to mend it.

414
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,530
Who said I liked her?

415
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:57,920
Stop.

416
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,470
I'm talking about the girl you like.

417
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,630
I didn't say it was her.

418
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:14,940
What's wrong?

419
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,810
She wants to learn how to ride a horse.

420
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,380
Come.

421
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,300
Hold the rein.

422
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:29,850
The rein.

423
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,570
Don't pull it so hard.

424
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,790
Relax your hands.

425
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,660
Move your arms with the horse's head.

426
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,770
Straighten your back.

427
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,470
Pat it gently.

428
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,830
Make it feel that you are very kind.

429
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,720
Hello, horse.

430
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,860
Yuan Lu, show her around.

431
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,840
Sure, no problem.

432
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,150
Don't worry, Your Highness. My horse is very obedient.

433
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,980
Straighten your back.

434
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:55,020
Slowly kick its belly.

435
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,830
Turn in the direction of where you want to go in.

436
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,370
I want to go right.

437
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,250
Then turn right. Again.

438
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,010
Yes.

439
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,350
I turned around!

440
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:05,250
Come on.

441
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:06,980
-Yuan Lu.
-Turn around.

442
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,620
Turn around, Your Highness.

443
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,300
Turn around!

444
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:10,390
Let's go.

445
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,790
Don't worry, Your Highness. I'm here.

446
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,290
I know how to turn around.

447
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,310
You ride very well.

448
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:15,870
Take your time.

449
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,610
Your Highness is great.

450
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:20,170
Yes.

451
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,130
Go further.

452
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,140
Your Highness, you are great!

453
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,560
-Amazing.
-Really?

454
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,470
Ruyi, am I riding well?

455
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,090
Don't worry, Your Highness. I'm here.

456
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,930
Okay.

457
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:35,730
Ruyi?

458
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,350
Yuan Lu.

459
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:36,810
Your Highness!

460
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,660
Yuan Lu, help!

461
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,420
Yuan Lu!

462
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,030
Yuan Lu!

463
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:42,920
Yuan Lu, save me!

464
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:43,930
Yuan Lu, watch out!

465
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,270
Yuan Lu!

466
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,240
This is how you learn fast.

467
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,190
Don't worry.

468
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:53,950
Wait.

469
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,550
Why didn't you let me ride a little longer?

470
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,680
I'm not tired at all.

471
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:07,980
How can this be?

472
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,980
Riding tests the strength of your back and legs the most.

473
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,890
You're just a beginner. Don't be greedy.

474
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,960
Have you practiced the dagger I asked you to do last time?

475
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:15,940
Yes.

476
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,570
Watch carefully.

477
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,340
[Guideyuan Pasture, the State of An]

478
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:30,330
Great.

479
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:31,360
Great.

480
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,170
How is it?

481
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,600
What's the rush, Your Majesty?

482
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,060
I hurried over before I even put on

483
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,690
my rouge properly.

484
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,450
You're here.

485
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:44,870
I want to ask you

486
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,040
what the name of your brother's daughter is.

487
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,670
Her name is Chu Yue.

488
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,150
Is she engaged?

489
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:55,780
Not yet.

490
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,580
That girl is very ambitious.

491
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,920
She always fights with my brother.

492
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,070
It's good that she's not engaged.

493
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,580
Here.

494
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,270
How about

495
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:10,870
I arrange a marriage for her?

496
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:15,210
I'll thank Your Majesty

497
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,750
on behalf of Chu Yue.

498
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,300
Which family's boy is it?

499
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,440
I'm afraid an ordinary man

500
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,940
won't be able to handle Chu Yue's personality.

501
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,150
Don't worry.

502
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,730
An ordinary man can't,

503
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:30,750
but Tongguang

504
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,290
can do it, right?

505
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,250
Tongguang?

506
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,720
Why does it have to be Chu Yue?

507
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,070
I can't accept it.

508
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,850
His Majesty just said it casually.

509
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,910
Maybe he'll forget it in two days.

510
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,850
His Majesty will definitely bestow the marriage.

511
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,520
He's afraid that Chu Yue will marry the second prince.

512
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,070
That way,

513
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,080
the forces of both Shaxi and Shadong would be united

514
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,200
and threaten his position.

515
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,690
Having Tongguang marry Yue

516
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:03,050
seems to be a favor from His Majesty,

517
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,050
but my brother and Yue are both so proud.

518
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,530
How could they accept a son-in-law like this?

519
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:13,730
If the marriage isn't harmonious,

520
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,660
then the Shaxi Tribe

521
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,490
will never stand behind the Tongguang.

522
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:20,870
Tongguang will only

523
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,100
be an official for his entire life.

524
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,900
I'll tell the Little Marquis now

525
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,420
to let him know how sad you are because of this.

526
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,620
The Little Marquis is loyal.

527
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:37,220
No matter what, he can delay it for a few years.

528
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,750
He won't.

529
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,470
He's always wanted to be the Cabinet Grand Secretary.

530
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,590
This marriage

531
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,810
can help him get His Majesty's favor

532
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:51,530
and help him win over the Shaxi Tribe.

533
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,910
He'd be more than willing.

534
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,830
I know

535
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,530
he doesn't like me

536
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,810
the way I like him.

537
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,800
I've always known

538
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:04,240
that he's just pretending with me.

539
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,240
He's just using me.

540
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,600
You may leave now.

541
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,170
I'm hungry.

542
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,870
So hungry.

543
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:18,850
What are you doing?

544
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,850
Stinky beggar!

545
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,150
What are you doing?

546
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,770
You dare to rob me?

547
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,610
I dare you to try again.

548
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,030
Please take pity on me.

549
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:29,630
Don't stop.

550
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,390
Hurry into the city.

551
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,670
[Taoran Inn, Jiangcheng]

552
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:43,250
Qian, Yuan Lu, and Sun Lang,

553
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,740
come out and carry these things.

554
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:52,610
Those kids just now were so pitiful.

555
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:53,400
Yuanzhou—

556
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,560
Mr. Ning,

557
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,620
can we help them?

558
00:27:58,330 --> 00:27:59,040
Your Highness,

559
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,850
last month, a patrol cavalry unit

560
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:02,810
passed by the neighboring county and the outskirts of Jiangcheng

561
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,090
and committed violence.

562
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,270
Some refugees escaped to Jiangcheng.

563
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:09,240
Some are still homeless.

564
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,940
It's 200 miles away from the An army's territory.

565
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:12,810
We'll definitely

566
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,850
encounter more cities like this along the way.

567
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,080
We can't save them all.

568
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,710
Can't we do something for them?

569
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:19,890
What you need to do now

570
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,260
is to learn from Ruyi

571
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,600
and save your brother.

572
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,490
This is the only thing you can do.

573
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,320
But we...

574
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,860
Your Highness, in two days,

575
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,270
we'll meet the officials of the State of An.

576
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,310
Go back to your room.

577
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,470
Mr. Du,

578
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,090
the closer we are to the State of An, the more hidden Scarlet Guards there'll be.

579
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,010
I'll go on patrol.

580
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:43,910
Rest early.

581
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:53,370
Sun Lang.

582
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:55,160
Here.

583
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,550
Take my jade amulet to the magistrate

584
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,530
and ask him to help the refugees settle as soon as possible.

585
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:01,850
Understood.

586
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,840
You are Prince Li of Wu?

587
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,640
Rise.

588
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,930
You don't have to say the word "rise."

589
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,480
Just raise your hand.

590
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:27,870
When the opponent is rude,

591
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,470
but you're unable to fight back,

592
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,830
the best solution is to not say anything.

593
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,740
The other party won't get the effect they want,

594
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:35,740
but they won't dare to stay silent.

595
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,380
As long as they speak again,

596
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,690
their imposing manner will be weakened.

597
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,900
Yuanzhou should have left already.

598
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:52,790
Ruyi, did you see earlier?

599
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,650
There are some refugees in the city too.

600
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:59,380
You want to give something to those beggars?

601
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,260
No.

602
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,650
Your main job is to deal with the State of An.

603
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,320
But I can go on your behalf.

604
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:12,230
Really?

605
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,740
Can you give us some money?

606
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,730
Can I have some?

607
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:24,560
Thank you.

608
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,000
It's you?

609
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:16,650
Yes.

610
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,810
Qian Zhao asked me to get some medicine for Yuan Lu.

611
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,240
I've sent someone to send it back,

612
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,640
but I saw you right after I left the pharmacy.

613
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,000
I wanted to

614
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:26,600
test how much the Left Emissary Ren has recovered.

615
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,170
You're still more skilled than me.

616
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:30,770
It's only 70%.

617
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,800
Some of my acupoints were injured for too long and I still can't open them.

618
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:37,300
But even if I recover completely,

619
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:38,830
I may not be your match.

620
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,460
You admit defeat before you even try.

621
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:44,690
This is not like you.

622
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:47,020
If a killer wants to live long,

623
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,930
they must know how to avoid

624
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:49,970
people who are stronger.

625
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,550
As expected of the Scarlet Guards' best assassin.

626
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,870
So, what did you buy today?

627
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,020
It's for you.

628
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:00,780
For me?

629
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:07,080
I saw calluses on your index finger joints.

630
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,010
I guessed you like carving.

631
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,980
I happen to have

632
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:13,030
a piece of heavenly meteoric iron from the previous dynasty.

633
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,760
I decided to make this.

634
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,620
I went around just now

635
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,070
and added a horn handle

636
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,080
so you can use it more easily.

637
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:21,870
Heavenly meteoric iron?

638
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,230
This is too valuable. I can't accept it.

639
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,480
Just accept it.

640
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,650
I'm gifting you this to please you.

641
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,040
To please me?

642
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:33,570
Why?

643
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:37,670
Why do you think a woman

644
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,180
would want to

645
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:41,380
please a man?

646
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,600
I'm really sorry.

647
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,440
Thank you.

648
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:11,720
By the way, what you just said...

649
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:15,720
I don't know.

650
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,930
Of course, it's to ask you for a favor.

651
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:24,010
We're about to enter the State of An.

652
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,700
How are you going to help me find out

653
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,890
who killed Empress Zhaojie?

654
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:29,770
Don't give me superficial answers.

655
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,640
I want to know the details

656
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:32,650
of what exactly you're going to do.

657
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:35,610
Don't worry.

658
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,420
I've thought about it already.

659
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:39,960
I'm thirsty.

660
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,690
Let's sit down and talk.

661
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,260
Okay.

662
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,400
Your tea.

663
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,040
Thank you.

664
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,150
Please enjoy.

665
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,410
The Palace of Hell is the headquarters of the Liudao Hall.

666
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,950
It's actually in charge of analyzing all kinds of secret reports,

667
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,150
but many of the original files

668
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:06,150
are distributed throughout the various divisions.

669
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,040
When Zhao Ji was in charge,

670
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,699
he locked the An Capital division's secret archive

671
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:10,929
for some time,

672
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:14,489
but Empress Zhaojie passed away five years ago.

673
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:17,409
There must be some information saved from that time.

674
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:19,679
The so-called secret files

675
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:21,670
are just documents,

676
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,190
such as letters between officials

677
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,090
and the historical officials—

678
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:32,590
You're all set.

679
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:33,150
Thank you.

680
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:42,870
Go on.

681
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,000
Everything in the court

682
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,830
will leave traces behind.

683
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:07,970
So...

684
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,010
So when we arrive in the State of An,

685
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:14,140
I'll take you

686
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:16,410
to the long-sealed secret archive

687
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:17,960
to find the file

688
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:21,160
and compare them back and forth.

689
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:24,280
We'll be able to find out the key figures

690
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:25,780
who benefited from Empress Zhao Jie's death.

691
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,010
Then we can find the real murderer

692
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,500
among those people.

693
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:12,060

702

Six years ago, when I was the chief of the Hell Path,

703
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,410
I was undercover there for a few months.

704

to assassinate Fang Daoxi, the Commissioner of Internal Affairs.

709
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,170
I wasn't there.

I can run fast.

00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:32,850
♫Let's look back in our next life♫

753
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:46,750
I could've avoided them myself.

754
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,730
♫The dream lingers for a while♫

755
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,570
I know,

756
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:53,440
♫Teardrops fall onto the robe after the farewell♫

757
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,910
but even if you're always capable,

758
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:55,720
♫Have you ever promised♫

759
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,700
you still need protection sometimes.

760
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,030
♫Two passionate hearts staying together forever♫

761
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:03,290
This is what Empress Zhaojie told me before.

762
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,860
♫Who will drink with me half a lifetime's wind and frost♫

763
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:05,620
I just copied her example.

764
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:08,580
♫Exchange myself for a sliver of light♫

765
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:09,990
♫If love does exist♫

766
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:16,200
♫Let's look back in our next life♫

767
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,090
Empress Zhaojie treated you very well.

768
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,460
Of course.

769
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,970
Most of my friends

770
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:28,820
who joined the Scarlet Guard with me

771
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,140
died from missions or tortures.

772
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,530
Sometimes, I had to go to the ice spring for punishment.

773
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,780
Empress Zhaojie would find an excuse

774
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,170
to send me to her palace for punishment.

775
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:39,830
After the gate closed,

776
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,750
she would have me drink with her

777
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:43,790
and played with the Second Prince she gave birth to.

778
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,980
She even taught the Second Prince to recite poems.

779
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,470
Departing young from home, returning old.

780
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,140
How can one discern if I'm male or female?

781
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:00,300
Empress Zhaojie is really interesting.

782
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:07,260
Actually, Liudao Hall was like the Scarlet Guards before.

783
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,290
We also had strict punishments

784
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,600
and a system of survival of the fittest,

785
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:14,100
but I've always believed that a good spy organization

786
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,050
shouldn't only select talents.

787
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:19,380
As long as ordinary people work together,

788
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:20,890
they can still create miracles.

789
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:23,370
Is that how

790
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,380
Yuan Lu and the others came to you?

791
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:27,830
Yes.

792
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,270
Take Shisan

793
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:31,530
as an example.

794
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:32,950
His mother

795
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,040
was a county lord of the previous dynasty.

796
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:37,080
He was born and raised in riches

797
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,890
and he grew into a playboy.

798
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,810
When he first joined the Asura Path,

799
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:45,230
he flirted with every female officer.

800
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,200
I had to follow him every day

801
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,450
to clean up his messes.

802
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:51,840
I also got whipped by the chief with him every day.

803
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,690
Then gradually,

804
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,300
he accepted me as his brother.

805
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,630
It's great to have a superior

806
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:58,960
like you.

807
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:03,010
I wasn't not as lucky as him.

808
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,830
I still remember what the Purple Emissary

809
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,710
who took me away to be a White Sparrow when I was seven

810
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,880
looked like.

811
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:14,730
My father had just bought me candy.

812
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,950
She had someone take me away,

813
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:18,730
crushed the candy

814
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,110
in front of me,

815
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:25,100
and whipped me 31 times.

816
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,250
Thirty-one times.

817
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,610
At that time, I swore in my heart

818
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,750
that one day,

819
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:36,430
I'd cut off 31 pieces of her flesh.

820
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,420
Not a piece less.

821
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,520
Did you take revenge

822
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,210
after you grew up?

823
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,410
She died early

824
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:48,030
in a mission in the State of Su.

825
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:50,950
Most female Scarlet Guards

826
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,280
don't live past 30 years old.

827
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,130
I'm almost there.

828
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,780
Don't be so pessimistic.

829
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,880
Didn't you leave the Scarlet Guards?

830
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,550
The rain has stopped.

831
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:12,600
Let's go back.

832
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,000
It's late already.

833
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,690
I'll go in first.

834
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:32,750
Okay.

835
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,200
Tomorrow, tell me where your acupoints

836
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:35,870
are blocked.

837
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:37,300
I’ll discuss with Qian Zhao and the others

838
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,610
to help you regain your power as soon as possible.

839
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:40,140
Thank you.

840
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:53,330
Wait.
