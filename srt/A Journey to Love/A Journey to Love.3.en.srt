Oh...

Call the physician! Come on!

6
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,400
Your Highness.

7
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,830
If you don't want Prince Ying to be
the emperor's envoy,

8
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,970
do you intend to go yourself?

9
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,150
-I haven't...
-Greetings to you, Brother Danyang,

10
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,980
from me, Yang Ying, the fourth son
of the late emperor.

11
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,090
The fourth son?

12
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,490
The fourth son?

13
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,780
Looks like a woman.

14
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,790
Greetings to you, Brother Danyang,

15
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,990
from me, Yang Ying, the fourth son
of the late emperor.

16
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,250
Ying?

17
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,770
Brother Danyang, you're in charge of
state affairs,

18
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,840
and Brother Ying is not well.

19
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,250
So

20
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,100
why not let me be the emperor's envoy?

21
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,600
It's very kind of you,

22
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,100
Brother Ying.

23
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,010
Your Majesty.

24
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,510
You may not know this,

25
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,290
but Brother Ying has been suffering
from ill health since childhood.

26
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,329
The late emperor was advised
by an eminent monk

27
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,970
to postpone entering his name into the imperial
family record until he's come of age.

28
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,700
Therefore, although he has not yet
been given a royal title,

29
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,890
Brother Ying is indeed a son
of the late emperor.

30
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,890
The late emperor

31
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,220
mentioned this to me and His Highness
Prince Danyang

32
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,770
many times.

33
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,070
Your Highness Prince Danyang,

34
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,790
am I right?

35
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,079
Ying,

36
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,090
do you realize how dangerous this trip
to the State of An

37
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:54,880
will be?

38
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,410
Do you really want to be
the emperor's envoy?

39
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,330
Of course I know it will be dangerous.

40
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,330
But as long as you make me a prince

41
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,850
as powerful as you,

42
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,310
and reward me generously,

43
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,290
I won't be afraid.

44
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,000
Nonsense!

45
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,850
Brother,

46
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,140
I really want to go.

47
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,779
His Majesty is also my brother.

48
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,740
I too hope he can come back soon.

49
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,230
As long as we can break this deadlock,

50
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,920
it doesn't matter if this person
is a princess or a prince.

51
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,210
The fourth son of the late emperor
is loyal to the state.

52
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,070
I implore Your Highness

53
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:41,680
to confer the title of Prince on him.

54
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,210
I second it.

55
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,330
I second it too.

56
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:56,909
Ying,

57
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,810
have you really made up your mind?

58
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,130
No regrets?

59
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,880
Okay.

60
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,020
Send my order.

61
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,390
Yang Ying, the fourth son of Emperor Jin,
is Prince Li of Wu.

62
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,140
He will go to the State of An as an envoy

63
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,980
and bring His Majesty back.

64
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,380
Your Highness is wise.

Your Highness.

69

I'm fine.

Your Highness,

71
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,390
why are you so silly?

72
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,240
I'm not silly.

73
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,460
I'm a prince now.

74
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,390
With a fief of only 800 households,
but what's the big deal?

75
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,130
As long as I bring my brother back,

76
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,830
I will be more respected than
my elder sister.

77
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,710
I will be able to get Yuanzhou pardoned,

78
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,480
as well as be with you.

79
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,990
But once An people

80

find out you are a fake prince,

81
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,220
you will die.

82
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,530
I'm not a fake.

83
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,130
I'm also Father's child.

84
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,280
Now,

85
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,180
I was a princess for so long

86
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,240
and only had two maids beside me.

87
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:34,070
But as soon as I was conferred the title,

88
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,630
my sister-in-law allotted eight maids to me.

89
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,140
What of this gorgeous life is there
to complain about?

90
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:44,360
Don't look at me like that, okay?

91
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,040
Otherwise,

the courage I've managed to pluck up

93
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,960
will be gone in no time.

94
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,270
I was actually really scared just now.

95

00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,460
there was a puppy called Ruyi

177
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,220
in the village we lived in?

178
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,930
It bit me.

179
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:17,740
Really?

180
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,690
I'm done.

181
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,540
I'll go wash the clothes in the backyard.

182
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,110
Boss,

183
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,510
can't you just be nice, like Shisan is?

186
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,630
I was testing her.

188
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,580
She's a dancer.

189
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,310
If she can't stand this,

190
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,480
it means she was a very proud person.

191
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:51,670
Or

192
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,140
she hasn't been a White Sparrow
for very long.

193
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,030
It seems to me that

194
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,680
you only started treating her like this

195
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,280
after she bit you the other day.

196
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,490
You are nice to other girls.

197
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,830
Now, I know what I'm doing.

198
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,010
Just eat.

199
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,370
Yuanzhou.

200
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,160
You are really still alive.

201
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,810
When did you come back?

202
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,490
The Ministry of War is looking for you
on the order of His Highness.

203
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,360
I just came back.

204
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,680
I've only just heard that
you're still alive,

205
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,390
so I came to have a look.

206
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,820
How are you? Are you hurt?

207
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,720
I'm fine.

208
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:46,670
How have you been?

209
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,040
Still haven't married into
the Yang family yet?

210
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,110
Yuanzhou,

211
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,720
when are you going to go
shopping for clothes with me?

212
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,450
Who is she?

213
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,050
Well...

214
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,430
She is an old neighbor of mine.

215
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:12,530
Let me introduce.

216
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,390
This is my cousin from my hometown.

217
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,920
I should go now.

218
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,670
This old friend of yours

219
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,070
is very nicely dressed.

220
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,870
She must be a noble lady.

221
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,120
She's seen me now.

222
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,970
Maybe she will

223
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,450
tell others

224
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,300
that I'm here.

225
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,000
Cousin,

226
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,720
if people start to suspect that
you have a cousin who is a spy,

227
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,580
it won't be very nice, right?

228
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,850
Seriously.

229
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,410
You can't do anything well,

230
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,650
and you're terrible at cooking.

231
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,130
But you're full of evil ideas.

232
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,240
What do you want?

233
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,070
Take me out of the city.

234
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,620
As soon as we're out of the city gate,

235
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:22,830
I'll leave immediately

236
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,500
-and won't bother you again.
-Okay.

237
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:33,710
Really?

238
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,060
Yes.

239
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,320
Thank you, Cousin.

240
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,160
This is what that person left
in the tavern.

241
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,370
You asked someone to give it to me.

242
00:15:59,400 --> 00:15:59,900
Yes.

243
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:01,810
What's wrong?

244
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,230
This is the Scarlet Guards' special wax shell
for their All-Purpose Antidote.

245
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:06,850
Only high-ranking Scarlet Guards

246
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,210
are qualified to use it.

247
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,930
This is no ordinary person.

248
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,360
If we let her return to the
headquarters alive,

249
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,890
we probably won't be able to
keep our cooperation a secret

250
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,710
for much longer.

251
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,430
Then you will be in danger, Mr. Yue,

252
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:22,950
won't you?

253
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,490
Are you going to stand by and watch?

254
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,420
People are speculating that Liudao Hall

255
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,370
leaked your state's military information.

256
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,980
I only need to add a little fuel

257
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,670
to make this known to the world.

258
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,720
That's absolute nonsense!

259
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,550
Liudao Hall has always been loyal.

260
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,230
His Majesty lost the battle because
he underestimated his enemy.

261
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,970
Even if you didn't do it,

262
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,350
if there are enough people who say you did,

263
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,090
it will become a fact.

264
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,980
What do you want?

265
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,240
Within a certain amount of time
after taking All-Purpose Antidote,

266
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,740
this person will lose
all her internal force.

267
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,790
If she wants to get the message
back to the headquarters,

268
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:04,180
she'll probably go to different branches
to dispatch pigeons.

269
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,730
The closest branches to the capital
are Kaiyang and Tianji.

270
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,760
I need to set up an ambush
in these two places.

271
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,530
The Scarlet Guards in the capital
of Wu are all dead now.

272
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,990
I need some men.

273
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,339
Mr. Zhao is away.

274
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,369
I can only give you six men.

275
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,040
Not enough.

276
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:25,990
At least ten.

277
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:28,300
Remember,

278
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,540
we are in the same boat now.

279
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,870
If we let this person leave
the State of Wu alive,

280
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,520
both of us will die.

281
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,110
Boss.

282
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:48,650
Boss.

283
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,020
What's wrong?

284
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,270
I went to buy the herbs
we'll need on the way

285
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,570
and overheard something.

286
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,380
The Scarlet Guards' Wu Capital branch

287
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:59,260
was wiped out by Zhao Ji's men
the night before last.

288
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:01,650
Wiped out?

289
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,130
The Scarlet Guards' Wu Capital branch

290
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,520
has been doing pretty well these years.

291
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,330
And they kept themselves well hidden

292
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,250
when I was in office.

293
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,900
They actually got wiped out by Zhao Ji.

294
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,990
There must have been some internal conflict,

295
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,880
or...

296
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,930
there was a mole among them.

297
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,030
Very impressive, Boss. You guessed it right.

298
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,440
I heard Lou Qingqiang call the masked man

299
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:31,700
Mr. Yue.

300
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,940
I think he's at least a Purple Emissary.

301
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:36,860
That makes sense.

302
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,680
There are intrigues and plots everywhere.

303
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,290
Zhao Ji has done enough to me.

304
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,140
That's not what I'm talking about.

305
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,210
I'm talking about Ruyi.

306
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,160
If she really is a White Sparrow
who managed to escape,

307
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,660
wouldn't she have been too lucky?

308
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:55,960
It never occurred to you before?

309
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,070
Wasn't it you who wanted to keep her?

310
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,300
I felt sorry for her.

311
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,470
Why don't you test her again?

312
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,370
How?

313
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:06,050
And what if we really find her out?

314
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,850
You ate her bean buns.

315
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,050
What should we do then?

316
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:17,950
Just kidding.

317
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,990
Whether she works for Scarlet Guards or not,

318
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,270
no matter what she did,

319
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,050
we're not part of Liudao Hall anymore.

320
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,280
It has nothing to do with us.

321
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,080
Saving her life

322
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,000
was just a kind deed on our part.

323
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,270
But...

324
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,580
the longer Zhao Ji's death is kept secret,

325
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,680
the more our men will be in danger.

326
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,950
So we'll set off early tomorrow morning.

327
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:44,180
Okay.

328
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,610
Have you taken your pills today?

329
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,050
Not yet.

330
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,480
Go back and rest now.

331
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,620
We'll set off early tomorrow.

332
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:55,070
Okay.

333
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,650
You heard all that?

334
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,660
Remember what you said.

335
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,030
Tomorrow morning,

336
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,370
after we part at the city gate,

337
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,520
we'll have nothing to do with each other.

338
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,910
[Pingyun Gate]

339
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,330
Your bag.

340
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,300
Go.

341
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,110
Next.

342
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:36,930
Zhang.

343
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,470
These are our own people.

344
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:39,640
They're good.

345
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,500
Let them go.

346
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,750
Are you really not going to ride the horse?

347
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,520
You'll go faster on it.

348
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:49,710
Thank you,

349
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,120
but I don't know how to ride a horse.

350
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:52,870
Okay.

351
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,190
Do take care of yourself.

352
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,580
Thank you for saving my life, Mr. Yuan.

353
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:58,790
Don't thank me.

354
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,520
It was Boss Ning who saved your life.

355
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,130
If he hadn't killed Zhao Ji,

356
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,900
both of us would have...

357
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,850
I owe you my life.

358
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:16,510
You're welcome.

359
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,280
I ate your bean bun.

360
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,750
We're even now.

361
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:23,700
Let's go, Yuan Lu.

362
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,500
If you want to get caught,

363
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,120
go to the Kaiyang and Tianji branches
in Luzhou.

364
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,580
Zhao Ji's men are going that way.

365
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,030
I'm not sure I understand you.

366
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,170
I'm going back to my hometown in Shengzhou.

367
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,190
Let's go.

368
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,460
Ning Yuanzhou!

369
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:42,610
Yuan Lu!

370
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:04,960
Ruyi?

371
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,320
Haven't you lost your internal force?
How is this possible?

372
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,930
Flying petals and falling leaves
can kill as well.

373
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,820
-You two go ahead.
-We'll go ahead.

374
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,530
Archers, shoot!

375
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,750
But... that's Mr. Ning.

376
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,750
One more word and I'll break all your bones!

377
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:10,280
I broke all her bones with my own hands.

378
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,780
Shoot!

379
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,290
Keep shooting!

380
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,250
Go!

381
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,280
Chief Ning.

382
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,350
How have you been?

383
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,410
Prime Minister.

384
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:55,930
It's been a while.

385
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,570
Since Zhao Ji failed to invite you over,

386
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,100
I had to come myself.

387
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,670
I'd like to treat you to tea.

388
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,140
Please.

389
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,440
Sir.

390
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,270
Stop!

391
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,220
The first.

392
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:43,510
You're easier on the eye
when you're not pretending.

393
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,970
Listen up, everyone.

394
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,940
Don't be rude to Chief Ning's friends.

395
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:57,940
Please.

396
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,210
Prime Minister,

397
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,160
I know what you're here for.

398
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,590
But I'm not competent enough

399
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,860
to undertake this task.

400
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,030
If you are not competent enough,

401
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:48,030
then I am no more than
a living corpse.

402
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:51,920
Please.

403
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,560
Tell me.

404
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,340
In the mind of

405
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,550
all you Liudao Hall officers,

406
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,300
what is a spy?

407
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,610
Someone who keeps watch, assassinates,

408
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:12,770
[Ding Hui, cavalryman of Heaven Path, Liudao Hall]

409
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,880
and lures people into betraying their state.

410
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,230
The military governor can easily

411
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,260
get these trivial things done
by keeping a few swordsmen.

412
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,290
But why does the court spend

413
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,730
one sixth of the annual military budget

414
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,390
on supporting Liudao Hall nevertheless?

415
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,430
Ning Yuanzhou might be only

416
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,770
slightly better than you in martial arts,

417
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,050
but in terms of wisdom and strategy,

418
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,240
he is far superior to you.

419
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,550
Among the thousand members of Liudao Hall,

420
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:38,930
he is the only one who knows that

421
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,170
the real function of a spy

422
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,500
is not assassinating or stealing,

423
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,550
but collecting information

424
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,690
that is truly useful to the state.

425
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,640
However,

426
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,000
after Chief Ning left,

427
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,610
Zhao Ji let Hell Path lie idle

428
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,860
and abolished the Palace of Hell.

429
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,830
Almost all of the intelligence
His Majesty got

430
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,750
before he set out was false.

431
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:02,610
Why?

432
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,120
It's because the Scarlet Guards
of the State of An

433
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,430
are not a bunch of weaklings.

434
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,660
They give out disinformation too.

435
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,650
Intelligence that hasn't been verified
in multiple ways

436
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,590
is nonsense.

437
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,170
Zhao Ji's henchman died just now,

438
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,250
and it didn't bother me at all.

439
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,140
Because in my eyes,

440
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:30,160
he is simply not a patch

441
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,070
on Chief Ning.

442
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,380
You're too kind, Prime Minister.

443
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:47,520
You know, I'm not trying to flatter you.

444
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,120
Part of the responsibility for His Majesty's
defeat and capture

445
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,330
lies with Liudao Hall.

446
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,270
To be honest,

447
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,200
I've always admired your talent.

448
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:00,130
But you never agreed to work for me.

449
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,530
So I could only stand by

450
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,490
and let Zhao Ji frame you
over and over again.

451
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:04,700
Prime Minister, I know

452
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:07,080
you're trying to be kind and forceful
at the same time.

453
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:12,010
But I've long been tired of the infighting
within the court.

454
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:14,550
And I've suffered various injuries

455
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,740
from being imprisoned.

456
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,570
I really can't undertake this task.

457
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:25,000
But...

458
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,210
you saw my cousin's ability just now.

459
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,980
I'm sure you can

460
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,250
threaten me with Yuan Lu's life and hers.

461
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:35,380
But I can assure you that

462
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,710
before their heads fall,

463
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:43,010
I will get you, Prime Minister,
to the paradise.

464
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,340
Really?

465
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:58,400
I believe you, of course.

466
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,270
And I believe you're not someone
who will be threatened.

467
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,470
But Mr. Ning,

468
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,210
what if Princess Ying's life is at stake?

469
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,610
An people have agreed to let us
ransom His Majesty with a large sum,

470
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:16,050
but on the condition that
we send a prince as the envoy.

471
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,150
As you know,

472
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,500
Prince Danyang governs the state,
and Prince Ying is seriously ill,

473
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:22,430
so Princess Ying volunteered
to go to An as a prince.

474
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:27,500
Right now,

475
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:30,280
she is bidding farewell
at the Meridian Gate.

476
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,480
In a little while,

477
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,720
her carriage will be passing here.

478
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,420
To be honest,

479
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,170
I don't really care

480
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:43,810
if you can bring His Majesty back.

481
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:47,500
I just need you to escort the princess
there, and let her meet him

482
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:48,890
and ask him for a decree

483
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,710
that orders the Empress's unborn child

484
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,220
to let me govern the state in the future.

485
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,650
Mr. Ning,

486
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,880
if you're still going to refuse,

487
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,530
I'll have the princess die now!

488
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:09,970
Actually,

489
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:13,070
I don't care who sits on the throne.

490
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:16,070
But I will never allow anyone

491
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:19,250
to jeopardize my control over Wu.

492
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,560
The princess's carriage

493
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,330
is now passing through the col
in the western suburb.

494
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,110
As soon as our whistling arrow goes out,

495
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:34,120
our men in ambush will ignite the gunpowder.

496
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,000
Mr. Ning,

497
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,140
you know that

498
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,920
I don't have much patience.

499
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,520
Ten.

500
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,480
Nine.

501
00:32:59,210 --> 00:32:59,980
Eight.

502
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,190
Seven.

503
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:06,470
Six.

504
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:09,850
Five.

505
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,740
The princess is only 16 years old.

506
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,810
What did she do wrong?

507
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,910
You're very good at keeping calm.

508
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,720
Information that hasn't been verified
in multiple ways

509
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,110
is nonsense.

510
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,160
You said that just now.

511
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,670
Wouldn't it be too imprudent

512
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,450
for me to believe you will
kill Princess Ying

513
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,580
just because you said so?

514
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:11,560
However, I do believe you would

515
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,860
send people to ambush her.

516
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,480
But it's only to give the false impression

517
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,980
that Prince Danyang is trying
to kill the princess,

518
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,280
for your future use.

519
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:22,239
Am I right?

520
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:28,380
Your Highness, please don't be alarmed.

521
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:31,360
It was just a rockfall on the path ahead.

522
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,290
Impressive.

523
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,389
Very insightful.

524
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,780
I'm increasingly tempted to think that

525
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,219
I shouldn't have chosen Zhao Ji
to take charge of Liudao Hall.

526
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:53,820
Fine.

527
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,690
If I give up threatening you now,

528
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,630
and ask you only as a citizen of Wu,

529
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,130
to escort the princess and
100,000 taels of gold to An,

530
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,900
and bring His Majesty back,

531
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,790
would you be willing?

532
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,110
Although people think that

533
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,160
I am a domineering and
treacherous official,

534
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,080
I still can't bear to see
my compatriots suffer.

535
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,110
Mr. Ning,

536
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,760
on account of our shared Wu citizenship,

537
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,650
please accept my request.

538
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:43,610
The people are indeed important.

539
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,050
But I have injuries and am afraid
I can't undertake this task.

540
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,530
Do you know that

541
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:07,310
the members of Heaven Path
who were escorting His Majesty

542
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:08,550
and were captured and
taken to the capital of An

543
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,100
have all died?

544
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,410
You mean Chai Ming and the others?

545
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:20,410
As soon as the southwestern pigeon route was resumed
from the previous interruption by the war,

546
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,560
we received a message from the outpost
in the capital of An.

547
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:25,790
The captured men of Heaven Path

548
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,000
have all died

549
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,160
due to severe injuries.

550
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,310
What a shame

551
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:42,120
that they are not heroes at the moment,

552
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,330
but are called traitors.

553
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,700
These are some anonymous leaflets
found in Zhanzhou,

554
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,130
where our army retreated to.

555
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:06,360
Have a look.

556
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,490
It says

557
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:12,710
"Liudao Hall betrayed the state.

558
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,720
The stupid emperor is in trouble."

559
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,160
This

560
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,800
is a memorial delivered to the court
by Huzhi Cavalry today.

561
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,450
It accuses the members of Heaven Path

562
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:27,660
of seizing power and colluding with
the State of An during the war,

563
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:29,800
leading to His Majesty's capture.

564
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,430
You can tear that apart,

565
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,920
but you can't keep people from talking.

566
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,130
A defeated general

567
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,080
will naturally try their best
to shift the blame.

568
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,650
And Heaven Path, of which
only one member returned,

569
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:48,950
became the best scapegoat.

570
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:52,700
Ning Yuanzhou,

571
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,180
as the former Deputy Chief of Liudao Hall,

572
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:57,690
you might be fine

573
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,390
with your past reforms coming to nothing,

574
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,680
but can you really watch these men

575
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,690
who carried you back from gory battlefields

576
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:06,550
get an eternal bad name after their death?

577
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,440
If I don't want to,

578
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:31,880
there is only one way.

579
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,420
I'll go to the State of An myself

580
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,720
and bring His Majesty back,

581
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:38,230
and let him tell the world about
the loyalty and bravery

582
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,410
of the men of Heaven Path
who died in the line of duty.

583
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,370
It's always easy to communicate

584
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:46,250
with a wise person.

585
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,690
So are you going

586
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,150
or not?

587
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,240
I'll need more support

588
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,320
to get this done.

589
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:30,920
Okay.

590
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,430
I've already prepared the edict.

591
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,280
From now on,

592
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,220
you'll be Commander of Left Guards

593
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:38,530
and back in charge of Liudao Hall.

594
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:46,610
This is the jade amulet given to me
by the late emperor.

595
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,020
With this, you can act as you see fit.

596
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,160
If you succeed,

597
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:51,830
I'll reward you handsomely.

598
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:52,890
If you fail,

599
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,400
there won't be any punishment.

600
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,740
I don't need any reward.

601
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:04,520
But please promise me,

602
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:06,410
once it's done,

603
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,740
you will let those men of Heaven Path
enter the Martyrs' Shrine,

604
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,600
ensure the princess's lifelong
safety and wealth,

605
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,060
and let me leave the court.

606
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:16,730
I promise.

607
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,450
A vow is like water thrown out.

608
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,700
It can't be taken back.

609
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:38,240
Prime Minister.

610
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,380
Chief Ning.

611
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:44,250
You may rise.

612
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:48,310
It seems that your reinstatement

613
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,940
is indeed what everyone was hoping for.

614
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:56,350
Where is Zhao Ji?

615
00:40:59,130 --> 00:40:59,810
Prime Minister,

616
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,190
Mr. Zhao went to the capital to hunt down
the remnants of the Scarlet Guards

617
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,130
and hasn't returned yet.

618
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:10,670
Chief Ning,

619
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:13,540
you are the one who calls the tune
at Liudao Hall now.

620
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,970
You can decide what to do with Zhao Ji

621
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:17,260
without having to worry about my feelings.

622
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,470
Thank you, Prime Minister.

623
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,190
Besides the few guards of Heaven Path,

624
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:24,230
how many people are you going to
take with you to the capital of An?

625
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,770
Quality over quantity.

626
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,420
Four will be enough.

627
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,220
Four?

628
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:29,280
Yes.

629
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:32,000
Yuan Lu, do you want to go to
the State of An with me

630
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:34,430
and see the desert that
you've never seen before?

631
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:37,030
Yes, yes, yes.

632
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:37,580
Wait.

633
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,450
Young man,

634
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,090
have you reached the age of 18 yet?

635
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,360
You think you can go if you want to?

636
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,690
Your martial arts skills
seem to be pretty average.

637
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:45,700
Yuan Lu,

638
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,280
take out your wooden kite

639
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:48,650
and show it to Prime Minister.

640
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:56,430
[Hungry Ghost Path]

641
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,870
Yuan Lu is a descendant of the Mo family,

642
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,120
as well as the most outstanding talent
of Hungry Ghost Path.

643
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,170
Who are the others?

644
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,990
[Sun Lang, commandant of Human Path, Liudao Hall]

645
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:40,910
Prime Minister,

646
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:44,050
please let your men feel free
to do whatever they want.

647
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:45,180
"Whatever"?

648
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:47,090
How arrogant.

649
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:48,620
Go.

650
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,910
Four-Symbol Eight-Trigram Formation.

651
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:12,400
That's right.

652
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,650
Sun Lang is good at defense.

653
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:41,950
Good.

654
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,100
Who are the other two?

655
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,110
One of them

656
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:48,020
is in the prison.

657
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,320
[Prison, Wu Capital]

658
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,120
It's time.

659
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:54,450
I've never been this beautiful before.

660
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:58,110
[Yu Shisan, former commandant of Asura Path, Liudao Hall]

661
00:44:58,730 --> 00:44:59,950
Thank you.

662
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,880
I didn't know I could be so beautiful.

663
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:05,030
Don't be so modest, Ms. Zheng.

664
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,050
Making women look more beautiful

665
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:12,240
is my

666
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:14,310
lifelong pursuit.

667
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:18,360
Yu Shisan, someone is here
to take you out of prison.

668
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,540
Shisan!

669
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:24,810
Don't go, Shisan.

670
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:26,550
Don't go.

671
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:27,650
How am I supposed to live

672
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:29,260
without you guys?

673
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:31,190
Shisan, don't go.

674
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:32,040
Don't go.

675
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,290
I don't want to leave you guys either.

676
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:34,270
Don't go.

677
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:34,940
I don't...

678
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:35,850
Don't go.

679
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:37,200
I don't want to leave you guys either.

680
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:38,890
Hurry up and get out of here!

681
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:39,610
I'm off.

682
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:41,140
I'm off again.

683
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,090
Goodbye.

684
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:44,250
Shisan, do a magic trick for me
one more time, will you?

685
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,260
To serve the beauty,

686
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:50,100
even if the world is against me,

687
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:51,400
I'll keep going.

688
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:52,370
It's for me!

689
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:53,760
Give me that!

690
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:55,130
Give it to me!

691
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,560
It's for me!

692
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,840
Shisan made it for me!

693
00:45:57,870 --> 00:45:58,760
He gave it to me!

694
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:30,460
Do you want to do something that's
dangerous and without pay?

695
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,020
If you do,

696
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:35,250
I'll forget about your abduction
of Minister Liu's daughter.

697
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,770
I'd say no if it were someone else asking.

698
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,190
But with you, Boss Ning,

699
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:39,660
I'll consider it.

700
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,830
Tell me, what is it?

701
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:48,860
To escort a young...

702
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:50,250
"Young"?

703
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,030
Delicate...

704
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:54,190
"Delicate"?

705
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:57,460
And beautiful princess to a faraway place.

706
00:46:57,770 --> 00:46:58,670
A princess?

707
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:01,420
I'm in.

708
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,080
Wait.

709
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:08,230
Wait for me.

710
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,940
Commandant Qian, Her Majesty
wants to see you.

711
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,030
[Qian Zhao, commandant of Yulin Army]

712
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,590
Your Majesty.

713
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,270
Perfect timing, Commandant Qian.

714
00:47:58,350 --> 00:47:59,090
You may rise.

715
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:04,530
We have depleted half of
the state treasury

716
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:05,930
preparing His Majesty's ransom.

717
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:08,720
I'm planning to sell the several
famous paintings

718
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,000
that I have in my private collection.

719
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:12,170
But I got confused

720
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:15,000
and couldn't tell which
of these two paintings

721
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:16,630
is the original work by Mr. Wu.

722
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,130
That should be the one.

723
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:45,160
The other one is solid and broken
at the same time.

724
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:48,240
It's probably a copy by
Mr. Wu's disciple Lu Daoke.

725
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,830
What does "solid and broken
at the same time" mean?

726
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:57,120
Please excuse my discourtesy.

727
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:04,710
Qian Zhao

728
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,780
was a former member of the
Heaven Path of Liudao Hall.

729
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:08,730
He was later transferred to
Yulin Army by special order

730
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,220
because of his meritorious service.

731
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:23,000
Your Majesty,

732
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:24,460
this

733
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:26,740
is a broken turn.

734
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:36,360
As befits someone from an eminent family,

735
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,220
you are well versed in both
culture and martial arts.

736
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,690
If it weren't for Prime Minister Zhang's
direct request,

737
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:41,710
I would be reluctant to let you leave.

738
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,520
Your Majesty.

739
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:57,290
Commandant Qian,

740
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:59,630
you are the most trusted
chief guard of His Majesty.

741
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:01,850
Before setting out on the expedition,

742
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:03,850
His Majesty ordered you
to protect Her Majesty.

743
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,420
As His Majesty is now being held prisoner,

744
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:08,670
would you be willing to
return to Liudao Hall

745
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:11,110
and go to An with Chief Ning

746
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:12,430
to bring His Majesty back?

747
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,650
That's what I was wishing to do.

748
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:23,530
I won't let you down.

749
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:31,550
Now that you have gathered everyone,

750
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:33,480
you should set out as soon as possible.

751
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:34,920
Okay.

752
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:36,910
We'll set out tomorrow morning.

753
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:40,510
But after we leave,

754
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,200
please keep an eye on Prince Danyang.

755
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:45,150
If he makes things difficult for us,

756
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,950
we will be in a very bad place.

757
00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:49,350
Don't worry.

758
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:51,020
I will do my best.

759
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:53,180
But as this concerns the throne,

760
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:55,100
he will definitely take action.

761
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:56,800
You yourselves

762
00:50:57,470 --> 00:50:58,960
should be careful.

763
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:00,690
Okay.

764
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:03,200
I won't be there

765
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:05,290
to see you off tomorrow.

766
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:09,160
May you return safely.

767
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:10,660
See you soon.

768
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,600
Thank you.

769
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:22,620
Don't worry, Prime Minister.

770
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:28,980
By the way,

771
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:31,020
will your beautiful cousin

772
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:33,830
be in the delegation?

773
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:37,680
No.

774
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:40,680
Okay.

775
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:47,030
I've known you for over 20 years.

776
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:49,700
How come I've never heard you have a cousin?

777
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:57,630
There are many things you don't know.

778
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:02,340
Prime Minister, aren't you worried

779
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,290
that Ning Yuanzhou might
go back on his word?

780
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,280
If he kidnaps the princess,

781
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:07,800
with 100,000 taels of gold,

782
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:09,430
he can find himself some place,

783
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,310
raise an army

784
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:11,600
and become a powerful force.

785
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:13,930
I think

786
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:15,950
we should keep his cousin

787
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:17,490
in the capital as a hostage.

788
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:22,620
She is even more ruthless than Zhao Ji.

789
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:24,310
Would you dare to keep her?

790
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:27,270
Don't worry.

791
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,410
Just now in the pavilion,

792
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:31,910
Ning Yuanzhou finished that cup of tea.

793
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,090
Didn't you see?

794
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,000
Was the tea...

795
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:39,230
This poison was secretly passed down
from previous dynasties.

796
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:41,330
It's called Ten-Day Qianji.

797
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:43,240
Any emissary out on a mission

798
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,150
is controlled using this poison.

799
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:47,690
One must take the antidote every ten days.

800
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:48,520
Otherwise...

801
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:54,120
I've sent people to get the antidote ready
in various places

802
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:55,080
along their way.

803
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,270
If he wants to slack off...

804
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:00,680
But Ning Yuanzhou is a clever man.

805
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:03,270
He knows how to reassure me.

806
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:04,850
So

807
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:07,480
I gave him the jade amulet

808
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:09,760
to reassure him.

809
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:18,660

810
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:25,820

818
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:47,490
Asura Path of Liudao Hall.

819
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:48,310
Yu Shisan.

820
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:53,810
[Yuan Lu]

821
00:53:57,810 --> 00:53:59,210
Hungry Ghost Path of Liudao Hall.

822
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:00,430
Yuan Lu.

823
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:03,770

824

[Liudao Hall]
