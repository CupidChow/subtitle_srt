[Episode 34]

4
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,230
This is all that's left.

5
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,870
We didn't risk our lives to steal these ashes

6
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,390
for the money.

7
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,110
We did this for what Left Emissary Ren did

8
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,340
for Scarlet Guards.

9
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:50,829
Thank you.

10
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,350
Chief,

11
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,430
you should bury Left Emissary Ren and let her rest in peace as soon as possible.

12

[Tomb of Ren Ruyi]

13
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,280
She found out so soon?

14
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,250
Princess Licheng said

15
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,390
considering your relationship with Lord Ren,

16
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,829
even if you couldn't find her body,

17
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,850
you would build a cenotaph for her.

18
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,320
She also said

19
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,350
if you have any conscience,

20
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,650
you must help her leave the palace temporarily

21
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,040
to mourn Lord Ren.

22
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,640
She knows why I've been promoted to be Duke?

23
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,050
Tell them to stop first.

24
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,730
I'm gonna make an excuse to see His Majesty immediately.

25
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,280
Get her out

26
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,480
when the palace guards change their shifts.

27
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,180
Seal the entrance

28
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,660
after she mourns her.

29
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,550
Are you sure?

30
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,010
My master liked tranquility.

31
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,800
I won't give anyone a chance

32
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,810
to disturb her peace.

33
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,980
No one can get in

34
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,740
even if it's Ning Yuanzhou.

35
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:59,909
When will Zhenye come back?

36
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,570
Your Majesty,

37
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,630
your edict of asking His Highness back

38
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,960
was just sent out the day before yesterday.

39
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,150
I believe in a few days,

40
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,440
His Highness will receive it.

41
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,420
You will see His Highness soon.

42
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,510
Good. Good.

43
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,500
Come.

44
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,770
Back then, I was a bit harsh on you.

45
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,910
But I did that for your own good.

46
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,390
I hope you can

47
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,340
help me support Zhenye

48
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,240
in making An more prosperous.

49
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,050
This is also why

50
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,670
I promoted you to be Duke.

51
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:51,980
Duke,

52
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,430
this is where I drop you off.

53
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,290
Take it.

54
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,610
I know something happened to your nephew recently.

55
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,260
You need a lot of money.

56
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,510
Thank you, Duke.

57
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,670
Right.

58
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,460
I think His Majesty has decided

59
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,650
to make Princess Licheng the crown princess.

60
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,510
You don't have to tell me this.

61
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,680
I don't treat you well

62
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,630
to get information from you.

63
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,770
But I should be sensible.

64
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,600
What's the matter?

65
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,950
Can't I come to you if there is nothing?

66
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,150
I'm a duke now.

67
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,750
It's not as convenient as it used to be.

68
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,420
If you become Cabinet Grand Secretary in the future,

69
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,590
there will be more reasons why you can't meet me, right?

70
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,050
It's inconvenient in the palace.

71
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,190
I left the palace to pay respect for Buddha for so many days.

72
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,870
Was it also inconvenient for you to meet me?

73
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,910
You had time to participate in a horse race with Chu Yue.

74
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,000
But you didn't have time to meet me in the temple, huh?

75
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,380
If I remember correctly,

76
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,420
it was you

77
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,300
who arranged this marriage for me.

78
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,310
Isn't that so?

79
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,440
You're saying these words

80
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,350
on purpose, right?

81
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:50,950
I told you

82
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,390
the collaboration between us

83
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,900
is the collaboration between me and Shaxi Tribe.

84
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,470
It's just

85
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,110
that Chu Yue has replaced you now.

86
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,230
Do you love Yue?

87
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,510
Did you specially ask me here

88
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,210
just to ask these boring questions?

89
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,410
This kind of question

90
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,190
may be boring to you,

91
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,680
but it's very important to me.

92
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,310
Answer me.

93
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,240
Or I won't help you again.

94
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:27,950
I don't love her.

95
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,170
She doesn't love me either.

96
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,260
Are you satisfied?

97
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,299
Then do you love me?

98
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,260
Don't you know?

99
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,870
Once you ask some questions,

100
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,550
you will never get the answers you want.

101
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,870
So you've been using my love for you.

102
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,050
You just played along with me

103
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,950
in order to let me help you.

104
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,470
Right?

105
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,420
In the beginning,

106
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,540
you approached me on purpose

107
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,640
because you wanted to know about the late empress, right?

108
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,920
Each of us got what we needed.

109
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,570
You shouldn't have made it sound so harsh.

110
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,950
Don't... Don't go.

111
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,510
I don't want to force you to do anything.

112
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,690
If you hate me,

113
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,430
I can make sure you'll never see me again.

114
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,680
Tongguang.

115
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,410
All this time,

116
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,580
have you ever

117
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,830
liked me?

118
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,120
Even just a little bit?

119
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,430
Very good.

120
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,830
Since you are so cruel, don't blame me for returning the favor.

121
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,310
You can leave the palace now

122
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,800
and go collect her body.

123
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:07,790
Who?

124
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,590
Who else could it be?

125
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,990
Princess Licheng, who you risked your life to save

126
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,910
from the fire.

127
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:18,690
What did you do?

128
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:24,190
She wants to take the title of empress

129
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,630
and you from me.

130
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,160
What do you think I would do to her?

131
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,750
If anything happens to her,

132
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,870
I will make you regret it.

133
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,620
Protect Her Highness!

134
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,390
Hold on! We must protect Her Highness!

135
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,560
See if anyone is pretending to be dead.

136
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,050
Don't let anyone escape.

137
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,150
Search!

138
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,750
Find the princess!

139
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,380
Yes.

140
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:38,870
Search here.

141
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,840
Be careful.

Why did Li Tongguang lie to me?

What took you so long to come to me?

172
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,830
I was so worried every day that I almost cried myself blind.

173
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,240
Where is my brother?

Don't worry.

176

Your brother is fine now.

177
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,230
Liudao Hall received a message

178
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,350
that he has passed Guideyuan.

179
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,510
He's heading to He County now.

180
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,470
Besides, not long ago,

181
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,030
I have rebuilt the divisions

182
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,070

183
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,470

Do you really have the heart

188
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,830
to keep Li Tongguang from knowing that you are still alive?

189
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,120
Ren Xin was killed by you two.

190
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,470
The person in front of you now

191
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,260
is Ren Ruyi.

192
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,230
You're so cruel and ruthless.

193
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,430
You're the same.

194
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,890
The stab you gave me was deep.

195
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,730
According to the records,

196
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,040
Left Emissary Ren Xin's heart

197
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,600
is different from the hearts of ordinary people.

198
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,900
It's in the middle of the chest, not on the left.

199
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,630
That's why you didn't die after a sharp arrow pierced your chest

200
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,890
during the attack in spring of the fifth year of Chengtian.

201
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,310
You asked me to stab the left side of your chest.

202
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,240
You did it on purpose.

203
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,240
But I won the bet.

204
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,040
I bet

205
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,310
you still have a sense of justice and dignity.

206
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:26,610
You helped me.

207
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,510
You didn't let the emperor of An mutilate my body.

208
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,880
And I was lucky.

209
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,540
I survived in the end.

210
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,630
I don't know why I helped you.

211
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,670
Maybe it was because of what

212
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:41,120
you have done all this time.

213
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:42,950
You're like a hero.

214
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,490
It makes us ashamed.

215
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:52,670
Take the medicine.

216
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,490
I see.

217
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,310
Looks like Deng Hui is a righteous man.

218
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,540
I was badly injured this time.

219
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:07,300
I wanted to come to you when I can move freely.

220
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,470
I didn't expect at night, I suddenly heard the sound

221
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,790
of Shaxi Tribe's signal of assembling its men to launch an attack.

222
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,069
I thought Jiu's horse riding arena is nearby.

223
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,490
So I came to take a look.

224
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:19,940
My men have been keeping an eye on the palace.

225
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,770
I heard that Li Tongguang's men got you out.

226
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,490
So I rushed here.

227
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,920
But I was still late.

228
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:27,750
Ying,

229
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,810
I failed to protect you well.

230
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:30,990
What are you talking about?

231
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,880
One of you had a narrow escape.

232
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,700
The other rushed back to An Capital day and night for me.

233
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,480
I'm so touched.

234
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,790
Why would I blame you?

235
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,190
Besides, I know

236
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,650
you will never leave me alone.

237
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,910
Let's go then.

238
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,660
Okay.

239
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,710
My men are waiting outside.

240
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,240
Ruyi, it's going to be a tough journey for you.

241
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,430
We need to move fast, and the journey will take 6 hours.

242
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,610
And then we can get rid of the An army.

243
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,390
Okay.

244
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,040
Let's go.

245
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:03,930
I'm not leaving.

246
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:06,580
I'm going back to the palace.

247
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:07,710
Going back to the palace?

248
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,690
Why?

249
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,230
You probably already know

250
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,950
about the edict issued by the emperor of An.

251
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,320
Whether I marry Second Prince

252
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,400
or him,

253
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,060
I will be the future female owner of this country.

254
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,630
Ruyi, Yuanzhou,

255
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,980
I don't want to go back.

256
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,080
You've trained a sparrow in the royal cage

257
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,430
into an eagle.

258
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,370
I can't go back anymore.

259
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,860
Ying, you can't be impulsive in this matter.

260
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,950
This is not a joke.

261
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,420
The political situation in An is complicated.

262
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,990
The emperor of An is cruel and ruthless.

263
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,910
You'll probably die if you stay.

264
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,130
Besides, the men who came to kill you just now

265
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,220
were probably sent by Noble Consort Chu.

266
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:59,910
The imperial palace is a place of intrigue and danger.

267
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,550
Without us being by your side,

268
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,730
what if the tragedy of Empress Zhaojie happens again?

269
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,130
I'm useful. The emperor of An won't kill me.

270
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:09,090
I grew up in the cold palace of Wu.

271
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,960
How could I not know

272
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,870
about the bitterness and sweetness and dirty tricks

273
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,770
in the imperial palace?

274
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,630
Don't worry. I'll be more careful in the future.

275
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,670
I also want to go back to Wu Capital with you.

276
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,700
But what can I do

277
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,480
after I go back?

278
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:30,710
I will still be a canary

279
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,160
in the imperial palace of Wu.

280
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,540
That's not the life I want.

281
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,570
There are things you're willing to risk your lives for.

282
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,350
Me too.

283
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,140
And I killed people before.

284
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,340
I can take action first when I'm in danger, right?

285
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,220
I've been a prince for so long.

286
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,210
During the past few months from Wu Capital to here,

287
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,500
I've seen so many people and things with you

288
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,030
along the way.

289
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,600
You, Qian, and Chief Clerk Du

290
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,360
made great efforts and risked your lives

291
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:08,190
in order to save my brother.

292
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,410
So I've figured it out.

293
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,230
If I can make the two states live in peace

294
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,650
by staying here,

295
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,030
even just for 3 or 5 years,

296
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,130
it'll be worth it.

297
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,200
You've grown up.

298
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,190
It's up to you.

299
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:44,670
Okay.

300
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:49,850
Take this.

301
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,140
If there's an emergency,

302
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,250
go to Jinsha Pavilion or Jinbao Inn to find Meiniang.

303
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,130
Okay.

304
00:20:58,530 --> 00:20:59,450
My men are outside.

305
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,070
The Commandant of the An Capital branch is named Ye Guang.

306
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,440
You can trust him completely.

307
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,990
Go to him if anything happens.

308
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,190
Okay.

309
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,070
By the way,

310
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,070
we've taken Mr. Du here.

311
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:11,770
He insisted on coming here when he heard you are in An Capital.

312
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,800
If he can enter the palace with you openly,

313
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,700
we won't be so worried.

314
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:19,800
Also,

315
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:24,970
take this tracker butterfly.

316
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,430
No matter when you are in danger,

317
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,390
I will receive a message

318
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,870
and come to save you immediately.

319
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,270
I'll ask

320
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:34,030
Ye Guang to handle the rest.

321
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,510
Don't worry.

322
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,810
I'm Ning Yuanzhou's little sister

323
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,080
and Ren Ruyi's disciple.

324
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,840
I will make you proud.

325
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,030
I believe

326
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,510
our Ying

327
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,340
has always been the best.

328
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,200
Ruyi,

329
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,130
if you have a daughter in the future,

330
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,110
can you give her the pet name of Ying?

331
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,320
I'll give her my best jewellery.

332
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,270
Okay.

333
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:13,590
What?

334
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,870
You won't give anything if it's a boy?

335
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,380
I like girls.

336
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:24,460
You're the boss.

337
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,870
In the first half of my life,

338
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,550
the luckiest thing is

339
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,850
I met a gentle and amiable empress.

340
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:34,590
In the future,

341
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,020
Ying will also be as lucky as me.

342
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:43,760
Let's go.

343
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,920
Take care, Ying.

344
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,070
You too.

345
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,600
Don't worry too much.

346
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,750
It's much safer for Ying

347
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,050
to go back with Ye Guang and the others

348
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,940
instead of us, who are wanted by the court.

349
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,390
You're right.

350
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,070
Where are we going now?

351
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,960
His Majesty and the others are on their way to He County.

352
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,440
Let's go there to meet them as soon as possible.

353
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,450
Good. I miss them too.

354
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,680
I want to see if Yuan Lu is obedient.

355
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:39,850
Why are you laughing?

356
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:44,860
I'm laughing

357
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,920
because finally, I don't have to risk my life

358
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,990
or go to the end of the world to find you.

359
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,030
Surviving a calamity

360
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:55,950
and regaining what was lost

361
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,890
are the happiest things in the world.

362
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:05,570
♫If the world is like a wave♫

363
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,820

371
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,030
There is only one last thing to do.

372
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:41,080
After we escort His Majesty back to Wu safely,

373
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,150
we will leave everything behind.

374
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,740
After that, we'll be ordinary people.

375
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,350
The world is vast.

376
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,950
We can go anywhere we want.

377
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:51,520
Okay?

378
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,140
Okay.

379
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,510
But...

380
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:01,980
Ning Yuanzhou.

381
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,540
Have you

382
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,310
forgotten something?

383
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,590
I haven't.

384
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,490
♫Rain covers the sound of my heartbeat♫

385
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:30,280
♫Farewells bring new wounds♫

386
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:37,300
♫Love is the trembling of fingertips when we separate♫

387
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,820
♫I waited, but I couldn't have♫

388
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:45,830
♫Two people for eternity♫

389
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:49,130
♫I waited and I got♫

390
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:56,470
♫This long journey where one shadow became two♫

391
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,680
♫At the end of the road, it's a dream♫

392
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:03,240
♫Even if we're not destined, it can't be forgotten♫

393
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,520
♫I thought I saw through fate♫

394
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:10,820
♫But when I wake from the dream, I'm still lost♫

395
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,840
♫Who will drink with me half a lifetime's wind and frost?♫

396
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:18,270

♫Let's look back in our next life♫

399

Yang Ying.

400
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,470
Don't go there.

401
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,250
♫The dream lingers for a while♫

402
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,630
I won't.

403
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,980
From the moment I killed her,

404
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,960
♫Teardrops fall onto the robe after the farewell♫

405
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,340
I'm no longer qualified.

406
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,250
♫Have you ever promised♫

407
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:54,550
♫Two passionate hearts staying together forever♫

408
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,180
Did she mention me?

409
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:57,370
♫Who will drink with me half a lifetime's wind and frost?♫

410
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,440
Yes.

411
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,100
♫Exchange myself for a sliver of light♫

412
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,750
She heard Shaxi Tribe's whistle of attacking.

413
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,660
Considering you come here often,

414
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,680
she was worried you might be in danger.

415
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,500
♫If love does exist♫

416
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,830
So she came here although she was badly injured.

417
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:09,720
♫Let's look back in our next life♫

418
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,450
But she didn't expect that it was me there.

419
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:10,870
I knew it.

420
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,700
[20 km outside Tianmenguan]

421
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,240
[Prince Youxian of Beipan]

422
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:34,500
When we arrive at the border later,

423
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,940
are you sure they'll open the city gate?

424
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,240
Don't worry.

425
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,750
When we arrive there, they'll open the gate

426
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,070
as long as I ask them to do it.

427
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,230
Just hide behind the rocks

428
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,010
and don't let the guards see you.

429
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,420
Okay, I believe you.

430
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:02,990
Your Highness,

431
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:05,900
will you really ask them to open the gate

432
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,470
to let Beipan people in?

433
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,850
Once Tianmenguan's gate is opened,

434
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,400
they will definitely fight.

435
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,710
This place is cold and barren.

436
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,490
I'm about to die here.

437
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,330
I don't care if they fight or not.

438
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,990
Father would rather banish me

439
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,720
than believe that I didn't kill Shouji.

440
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,980
Such being the case,

441
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,880
don't blame me for learning from him

442
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,330
to cooperate with Beipan people.

443
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,110
Please think twice, Your Highness.

444
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,470
Opening the gate to let Beipan people in

445
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,200
is a serious crime.

446
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,030
Nonsense.

447
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,990
Beipan people are not used to the life within the border.

448
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,790
I made a deal with Prince Youxian.

449
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,260
This time,

450
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,750
after they get enough money and food

451
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,110
and help me get the throne,

452
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,110
they will go back.

453
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:03,440
Compared to coming south to rob us at the cost of thousands of casualties every year,

454
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,560
isn't it better that I

455
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,940
offer them tributes every year?

456
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:12,850
But...

457
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,590
Shut up!

458
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,570
Have you forgotten no one came to save us

459
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,600
and we were starving and could only eat grass

460
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:21,460
when we were trapped by the stones in the quarry

461
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,280
in order to find the stone materials

462
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,160
used to repair this barrier?

463
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,210
If it weren't for these Beipan people,

464
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:29,700
you and I

465
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,670
would have died here long ago.

466
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,070
I also know

467
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,750
those men of Shabei Tribe guarding the border

468
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,380
don't care if I'm dead or alive

469
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,830
because I've been banished.

470
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,830
So does my father.

471
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:50,040
Since they are cruel to me,

472
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,500
don't blame me for returning the favor.

473
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,500
Sun Lang.

474
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,270
Where are we?

475
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,280
Your Majesty,

476
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,930
looks like we're close to Tianmenguan judging from the terrain.

477
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,460
Yu went to the front to be a scout.

478
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:35,020
We'll know when he's back.

479
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:37,950
Okay.

480
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:42,590
Yuan Lu.

481
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,840
Yuan Lu. Yuan Lu.

482
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,330
Stay clear-minded.

483
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,070
Stop.

484
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:04,470
Your Majesty,

485
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,470
last time, I told you about the observation deck

486
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,850
where you can overlook the whole country. It's nearby.

487
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,290
Your Majesty, please go with me.

488
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,660
The observation deck?

489
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,240
Qian, we just stopped.

490
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,700
How about letting His Majesty rest for a while?

491
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,580
I'm afraid if we miss it,

492
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,090
there won't be such a good place like this again.

493
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,020
Qian.

494
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,530
It's fine.

495
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:28,130
We've been traveling all night. It's a bit suffocating.

496
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:30,930
I'll go for a walk with Qian.

497
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:32,330
Okay.

498
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,310
Where is my wine?

499
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:35,450
Here.

500
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,070
His Majesty likes tranquility.

501
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,280
I'll go with him.

502
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,720
Lang,

503
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:56,100
Qian is so nice to His Majesty.

504
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,730
He went to enjoy scenery with him on the journey of escape.

505
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,110
He even asked you to prepare some good wine.

506
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,890
His Majesty has been imprisoned for so long.

507
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,730
Whether it's noble people

508
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,430
or ordinary people,

509
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,640
anyone can be tasteful.

510
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,510
Take me as an example.

511
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,390
No matter where I go or how tired I am,

512
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,920
as long as I touch

513
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,680
those soft, fragrant,

514
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,410
and fluffy cats, dogs, and rabbits

515
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:23,850
and hold them in my arms,

516
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:25,630
I...

517
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,190
I...

518
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,350
This is not

519
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,780
a beautiful place.

520
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,970
Your Majesty, please take a closer look.

521
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,500
Qian,

522
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,760
I can't see any scenery.

523
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,180
Then have you ever thought about this?

524
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,530
What kind of scenery

525
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,550
can the soldiers of Wu

526
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,190
who died in the Tianmenguan battle see

527
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:21,260
in the underworld?

528
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:53,670
This place is...

529
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:54,370
Yes.

530
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,370
This is where you were defeated

531
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,280
a few months ago.

532
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:15,949
Brothers,

533
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:20,469
today, I'm going to use the blood of the emperor

534
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,070
to pay tribute to you.

535
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,219
After I ask them to open the gate

536
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,000
and arrange everything,

537
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,820
I will put a red cloak

538
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,330
on my horseback.

539
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,800
By that time, you can lead the army

540
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,659
and enter the border.

541
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,940
[Tianmenguan]

542
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,270
Your Highness, you are finally back.

543
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,300
I've been looking for you for days.

544
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,530
We couldn't find any stone materials.

545
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,770
And we got hurt.

546
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,400
Open the gate now.

547
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:12,220
Yes. Open the gate now.

548
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:35,820
Right.

549
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,810
Cover the wound on the horseback.

550
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,910
What's wrong with him?

551
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,310
Your Highness,

552
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:13,530
I was so worried because I couldn't find you.

553
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,990
The edict of asking you back to the capital was delivered here yesterday.

554
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:17,870
Your Highness, go take a shower and get changed now.

555
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,450
What edict?

556
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:20,490
Your Highness,

557
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,650
the eunuch who delivered the edict secretly told me

558
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,900
His Majesty wants to form a matrimonial alliance with Wu.

559
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,960
They are working on the state letters.

560
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,250
Princess Licheng will be the crown princess.

561
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,850
After you go back to the capital,

562
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,430
it's very likely you'll become the crown prince.

563
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,980
Congratulations, Your Highness.

564
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,350
Congratulations, Your Highness.

565
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,850
Close the gate! Close the gate!

566
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,840
Beipan people are coming.

567
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:48,350
Hurry!

568
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,420
Close the gate!

569
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,590
Close the gate! Close the gate!

570
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:52,890
Hurry!

571
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,740
Close the gate!

572
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,050
Hurry up! Hurry up!

573
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,230
What should I do?

574
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,180
Did I make a mistake?

575
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,770
Look carefully. This is Second Prince.

576
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,570
Your Highness, what should we do?

577
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:47,690
Don't be afraid.

578
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,950
Let's steal Beipan people's clothes and sneak away.

579
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,860
Anyway, the destination of Beipan people is He County.

580
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:53,870
It didn't belong to An back then.

581
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:55,490
No matter how many people will die, it has nothing to do with us.

582
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,190
As long as Father doesn't know this

583
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,750
and Beipan people don't tell anyone,

584
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:00,810
I can still be the crown prince.

585
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,560
And I didn't collude with the enemies.

586
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,030
Your Highness, let's go.

587
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:10,670
Let's go.

588
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:11,930
Let's go.

589
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,800
Ignite the fire beacons. Release the whistling arrow.

590
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:49,870
Lang.

591
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:51,350
Lang.

592
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,420
What flowers did His Majesty go to see?

593
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,740
He hasn't come back yet.

594
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:07,710
Did something happen?

595
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,080
We're not there yet. He can't die here.

596
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,530
He has to solve the problem before he dies.

597
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:18,980
Let's go have a look.

598
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,610
-Qian!
-Qian!

599
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:26,820
Qian!

600
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:27,310
Qian.

601
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,070
Don't come over.

602
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,510
Qian, what are you doing?

603
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,280
I'm seeking justice

604
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:36,050
for Chai Ming,

605
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,100
the brothers of Liudao Hall,

606
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:41,700
and thousands of soldiers of Wu.

607
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:45,020
Qian, calm down first.

608
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,820
That's our emperor.

609
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,240
Our emperor?

610
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,350
Then let me ask our emperor.

611
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,150
Do you still remember those

612
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,030
who died for you?

613
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,050
The amulet badges of Liudao Hall.

614
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:07,880
Qian,

615
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,910
why do you have the amulet badges

616
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,360
of the brothers?

617
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,630
They left us forever due to the battle.

618
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,220
If I don't keep their last things,

619
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,670
who else would remember them?

620
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,030
Shi Xiaoyu

621
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:29,680
joined Liudao Hall at 9.

622
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:33,220
He was the fastest runner among the cavalries of the Heaven Path.

623
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,900
But in the Tianmenguan battle,

624
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,260
he died because his legs were blown off.

625
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,850
He was only 16 years old when he died.

626
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,510
Dong Dashan,

627
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,350
21 years old,

628
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,740
was most afraid of heat.

629
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:50,350
But he was burnt to death when he went to inquire about the An army's information.

630
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,070
Guan Qing,

631
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,040
24 years old,

632
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:57,310
just had a daughter before the battle.

633
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:00,080
But he was hit in the chest by the An army with rocks and died

634
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:04,910
before he had a chance to experience the happiness of having a daughter.

635
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,130
Yan Jun

636
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:09,370
was pierced in his belly

637
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,820
by the An army with 6 spears and died

638
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:14,110
on his 29th birthday

639
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:16,080
in order to protect our stupid emperor.

640
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:19,310
Gou Ping

641
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:22,750
had been a drunkard for 33 years.

642
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:26,330
But to help his comrades, he was stabbed 18 times.

643
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,020
He could never drink the Tongshan Wine

644
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:32,990
from Kainian in Wu Capital again.

645
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,610
Qin Bin,

646
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:41,050
48 years old,

647
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,990
didn't have a wife or child in his life.

648
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:47,350
He fought dozens of battles

649
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:49,670
including those in Rongcheng, Tianshui,

650
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,320
Pingying, and Julangguan.

651
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,490
In the Tianmenguan battle,

652
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:00,710
he was hit by 38 arrows and died.

653
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:04,710
He was still holding the banner of Wu when he died.

654
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,190
I'm sorry.

655
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,270
What's the use of admitting your mistake now?

656
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:17,590
Can you bring them back to life

657
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:18,900
by admitting your mistake now?

658
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:24,560
Can you bring my younger brother back to life

659
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:27,520
by admitting your mistake now?

660
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:35,990
Chai Ming.

661
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:41,990
Chai Ming is your younger brother?

662
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:55,720
You all don't know this, right?

663
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:58,290
Chai Ming is my younger brother.

664
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:02,050
We have the same father but a different mother.

665
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,610
I've hated him since childhood.

666
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:13,800
But he was so shameless.

667
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:17,490
He kept pestering me every day.

668
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,290
After he knew I became a hereditary member of the Yulin Army,

669
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:25,050
he tried his best to be admitted into Liudao Hall.

670
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,450
He said in this way,

671
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:30,000
he could see me often in the palace.

672
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:33,180
I made so many excuses

673
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:34,730
to scold or punish him.

674
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:38,010
Although he looked unhappy,

675
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:41,330
he would still call me Brother

676
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:44,330
when we met

677
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,410
again.

678
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:51,970
I planned

679
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,560
to stop beating him

680
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,970
when he was 20.

681
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:01,370
I wanted to stop beating him and accept him

682
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:03,190
as my younger brother when he was 20.

683
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,000
But unexpectedly,

684
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,720
he did a great job in the Heaven Path.

685
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:12,010
And you took him to the battlefield.

686
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,100
I'm sorry.

687
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:17,040
He wrote to me every day after you went to the battle.

688
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:18,500
Brother,

689
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:21,820
every day, I advised His Majesty

690
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,310
not to listen to the eunuch.

691
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:24,850
But His Majesty just wouldn't listen.

692
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:26,940
Brother,

693
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:29,480
His Majesty pursues quick success and is reckless.

694
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:32,220
We lose over 3,000 people every day.

695
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,320
If this goes on,

696
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:39,030
I'm afraid there will be a disaster.

697
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:45,450
My only family in this world

698
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:48,950
didn't have a chance to hear me call him Brother.

699
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:51,980
Just to save your life,

700
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:53,380
Watch out, Your Majesty!

701
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,620
he took an arrow for you down here.

702
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,940
I collected his bones.

703
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,560
Right here.

704
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:08,440
The arrowhead pierced his heart and lungs and was 0.5-inch into his bones.

705
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:11,890
He was only 19 years old.

706
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,020
I'm sorry.

707
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,240
So much for risking our lives

708
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:23,130
for the State of Wu.

709
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:25,970
So much for sacrificing for our country

710
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:28,480
and facing death unflinchingly.

711
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:32,370
Since the day we set off,

712
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:34,300
I've been secretly planning

713
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:36,410
to take you here after saving you

714
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,310
and use your life

715
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:41,340
to let the soldiers of Wu who died wrongfully rest in peace.

716
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,340
Qian,

717
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,100
killing the emperor is an unforgivable crime.

718
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,300
I understand

719
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:48,170
you want to avenge the brothers and Chai.

720
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:49,190
We also want to avenge them.

721
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:50,570
But have you forgotten

722
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:52,450
what Boss Ning said

723
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:53,490
when he left His Majesty to you?

724
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:56,050
Don't you feel guilty towards him?

725
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:04,690
-Lang.
-What are you doing?

726
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,640
Lang, calm down. Lang.

727
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,330
You actually want to stop me.

728
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:11,330
Just for this stupid emperor?
