[A Journey To Love]

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,970
[Episode 4]

4
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,330
When you killed Lou Qingqiang yesterday,

5
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,729
why did you say he was the first one?

6
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,920
He was the first one to bully and kill Ling Long

7
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:56,920
in the branch.

8
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,500
Ling Long?

9
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,030
Is she...

10
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,290
your White Sparrow sister?

11
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,820
But you shouldn't have done it at that time.

12
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,630
I know better than anyone

13
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,420
when is the best time to do it.

14
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,050
You can't even do your job well as a White Sparrow.

15
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,570
I'm the best assassin.

16
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:20,740
Except assassination,

17
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,690
I'm indeed not good at other things.

18
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,260
Then why would the best assassin

19
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,190
do something stupid like coming back

20
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,410
and exposing her martial arts skills easily?

21
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,600
Because Yuan Lu reminded me.

22
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,870
You killed Zhao Ji.

23
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,810
And he was the second one.

24
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,050
I hate owing people favors.

25
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:45,430
I see.

26
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,130
Then we're even.

27
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,530
Now you've become

28
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,530
the chief of Liudao Hall again.

29
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,800
Why would you let me go?

30
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,680
Because this decision has been made

31
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,410
before I became the chief.

32
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,740
And you've shamelessly

33
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,240
given all you have.

34
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,680
I'll take it as doing good deeds.

35
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,230
But your biggest luck is

36
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,590
your characteristics don't match

37
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,710
any of the enemies of Palace of Hell or Liudao Hall.

38
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,110
Otherwise,

39
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,680
I wouldn't have been that kind.

40
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,960
You are so soft-hearted.

41
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,990
No wonder you were betrayed by someone like Zhao Ji.

42
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,810
You too.

43
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,920
You're a top killer,

44
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,130
but you're willing to start over.

45
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,650
And for a White Sparrow,

46
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,710
you went to kill Liudao Hall's chief.

47
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,490
You're not that smart either.

48
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,050
Are you a traitor of Scarlet Guards?

49
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,329
I'm nobody.

50
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,070
I'm just a dead person.

51
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:13,540
All right.

52
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,970
I hope we go our separate ways

53
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,000
and never meet again.

54
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,070
Then...

55
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,970
can I stay?

56
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,110
You want to save the emperor of Wu, right?

57
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,010
In a few days,

58
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,820
my internal force will gradually recover.

59
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,230
Take me with you.

60
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,430
I can do many things for you.

61
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,320
I know a lot of things

62
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,270
in the harem and court of the State of An.

63
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,490
You want to disguise yourself in the delegation

64
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,920
to avoid Mr. Yue's hunt, right?

65
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,560
I just want to know who Mr. Yue is.

66
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,950
This person

67
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,420
sold out

68
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,030
Scarlet Guards' Wu Capital Branch to you.

69
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,680
Only Zhao Ji and his followers

70
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,870
know who Mr. Yue is.

71
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,650
But most of them are dead.

72
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,530
However,

73
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,740
Yuan Lu and our shadow scouts have found out

74
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,880
Mr. Yue is about 3 inches taller than you.

75
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,080
Mr. Yue always shows up

76
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,290
with a mask and a cloak.

77
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,870
Mr. Yue came to Wu Capital from the State of An 3 years ago.

78
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,190
Judging from Mr. Yue's martial arts skills,

79
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,120
Mr. Yue is at least a Purple Emissary.

80
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,080
Can you investigate one more thing for me?

81
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,490
I have a very important friend,

82
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,460
who was suddenly murdered a few years ago.

83
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,130
But before she died,

84
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,560
she just wouldn't tell me who the murderer is.

85
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,590
I want to avenge her.

86
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:30,830
You're so smart,

87
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,040
and you have powerful Hell Path and Palace of Hell.

88
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,070
Can you...

89
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:34,600
No.

90
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,420
I told you what I told you

91
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,330
to make you owe me a favor,

92
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,290
so that you can keep the secret of the delegation for me.

93
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,760
As for you,

94
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,290
our delegation doesn't need an assassin.

95
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:55,590
You have too many secrets,

96
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,970
and my mission is too important.

97
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,260
The best way for us to get along

98
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,870
is

99
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,970
to go our separate ways.

100
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,150
By the way,

101
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,840
is Mr. Yue the third one?

102
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,500
It's none of your business.

103
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,420
Pretty.

104
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,030
Yes, of course I am pretty.

105
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,350
Why are you

106
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,430
either fat or old?

107
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,820
It's been a long time.

108
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,170
You didn't set high requirements for yourselves,

109
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:44,770
right?

110
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,940
As long as it's reasonable,

111
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,650
we can tailor our uniforms.

112
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,370
Why?

113
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,050
Boss.

114
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:51,980
It makes me look much better.

115
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,310
Everything is ready.

116
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,010
Am I pretty?

117
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,720
You look pretty energetic.

118
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,140
Chief.

119
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,060
Stand up. Stand up and talk.

120
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:37,920
Boss Ning,

121
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,540
I feel guilty towards other brothers of Heaven Path.

122
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,370
If it were me instead of Chai Ming

123
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,350
who protected His Majesty from the arrow,

124
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,770
they wouldn't have been left on the beach by An people

125
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,240
and died in a foreign land

126
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,370
with an accusation of treason.

127
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,470
For the men of Liudao Hall,

128
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,220
it doesn't matter where we die,

129
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,060
unless we return to our hometowns in glory.

130
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,400
The mission this time is for both the people and them.

131
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,140
We will clear the name of Heaven Path.

132
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,720
You and Du stay in the headquarters.

133
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,030
Get ready to support us at any time.

134
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:15,720
Okay.

135
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:19,390
Bring me wine.

136
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:30,880
First, it's for the Heaven and Earth.

137
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,299
Second, it's for our comrades.

138
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,929
Third, it's for sending us off.

139
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:48,640
Bottoms up.

140
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,640
Let's go.

141
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,310
[Ning Residence]

142
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:15,430
Let's set off.

143
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,160
Really?

144
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,770
You didn't drink much wine, but you look weak.

145
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,620
Boss caught a cold when he was in prison and tortured.

146
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,660
He hasn't recovered yet.

147
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,070
Do you think

148
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,410
he has so many different kinds

149
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,860
of women to take care of him? Just like you?

150
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,480
Boss, are you okay?

151
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,370
I'm fine.

152
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,430
Lu,

153
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,340
don't be envious.

154
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,560
I can teach you if you want to learn.

155
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,900
But first,

156
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,640
you need to call me Master Shisan.

157
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:43,740
No need.

158
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,880
Qian. Qian.

159
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,820
Prescribe some medicine for Boss Ning.

160
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,700
I only know how to cure diseases. I don't know what to do with love sickness.

161
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,060
I'm afraid he's like this

162
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,100
because he doesn't want to be parted from his beautiful cousin.

163
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,870
Cousin?

164
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,630
Beautiful?

165
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,450
Qian.

166
00:09:58,890 --> 00:09:59,900
Boss, are you okay?

167
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:01,250
I'm okay.

168
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,880
What cousin?

169
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,690
Prime Minister Zhang said it himself. How could it be wrong?

170
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:06,790
Boss,

171
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,620
has Ruyi really left?

172
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,210
Yes.

173
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,920
Did she tell you her true identity

174
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,450
when she left?

175
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,640
It's probably what I guessed.

176
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,590
When she mentioned the 3 words,

177
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,750
she was very cold.

178
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,000
But when she avenged her friend,

179
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,290
she was very determined.

180
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,130
I guess she's an abandoned pawn.

181
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,630
That's why she has such complicated feelings.

182
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,090
Feelings?

183
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,570
What's so complicated about feelings?

184
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:35,970
Qian Zhao,

185
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,520
where is the emperor of An now?

186
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,460
After he captured Xu, Cai, and Jing cities,

187
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,830
his military strength reached its limit.

188
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,430
After sending some soldiers to guard the cities,

189

His Majesty is also with the army.

192
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:50,490
Okay.

Thank you, Your Majesty.

205

Your Majesty, do you like the wine?

206
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,100
It's bitter and astringent.

207
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,590
It's hard to swallow it.

208
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,260
Both good and evil people

209
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,500
are here at the national banquet of the State of An.

210
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,510
It's inappropriate.

211
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,710
The war is over. The people won't suffer anymore.

212
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,490
Even though it's inappropriate, what can you do about it?

213
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,620
Maybe you need to be a guest in the State of An

214

for decades.

215
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,300
You'd better get used to it as soon as possible.

216
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,340
Tongguang has grown up suddenly.

217
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,260
Looks like I should find him

218
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,780
a noble lady as soon as possible.

219
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,960
I don't think that's enough.

220
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,750
This time, he made the greatest contribution

221
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,750
to capturing the emperor of Wu alive.

222
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,130
Apart from finding him a beauty,

223
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,410
I'm afraid

224
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,390
you should also promote him as Duke.

It hasn't been easy for Tongguang.

227

After all, half of your bloodline comes from Wu people.

228
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,650
Brother, don't be ridiculous.

229

Tongguang is the only child of Aunt Qingning.

Father has granted the royal family name to him. He's extremely noble.

He has no Wu people's bloodline.

00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,400
is a lowly paramour from Wu, right?

235

Come out now.

263
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,590

The harem is full of noble ladies from different tribes.

He wants to balance the power of the tribes.

287
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,930
That's why he always said

288
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:16,010
he misses my cousin Empress Zhaojie

289
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,210

00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:45,470
since she left the capital.

375
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,000
We came in a hurry this time.

376
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:47,900
We didn't bring an imperial physician.

377
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:48,980
Besides,

378
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,440
considering the situation of the princess,

379
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,820
we can't just invite a civilian doctor.

380
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,220
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

381
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,020
I didn't mean to get sick.

382
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,870
But I couldn't eat or sleep well along the way.

383
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,710
And Chief Clerk Du and Ms. Ming would teach me every day.

384
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,690
And they would force me to learn things about the State of An.

385
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,060
Then how did it go?

386
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:24,010
Not bad.

387
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,590
Nothing serious.

388
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,190
I think it's the incoordination between the spleen and the stomach

389
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,290
due to the bumpy ride.

390
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:31,720
That's good.

391
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,270
Listen. Later,

392
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,200
prescribe some medicine for Her Highness.

393
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:36,910
Okay.

394
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,960
Your Highness, I'm gonna ask you some questions as a test.

395
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:53,190
How many princes are there in the State of An?

396
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:54,790
What are their titles?

397
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:55,730
3.

398
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,210
One is called Xiluo...

399
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,240
Prince Luoxi.

400
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,350
The other 2...

401
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:02,170
are...

402
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,780
I remembered them just now.

403
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:10,410
I just can't remember them all of a sudden.

404
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,090
Boss,

405
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,900
didn't Qian say

406
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,700
Her Highness is too tired due to the bumpy ride?

407
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,690
Why don't you let Her Highness rest first

408
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,310
and give her a test another day?

409
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:31,980
Okay.

410
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,420
Your Highness, since you are tired,

411
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,850
we should leave.

412
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,630
Ding Hui, come here.

413
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,240
Yes.

414
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,530
Lords,

415
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:01,770
you failed your duties.

416
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,910
I'm sorry for being incompetent.

417
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,630
Her Highness hasn't been feeling well lately.

418
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,770
I can't force her to learn.

419
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,070
That's right.

420
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,810
Her Highness is too weak.

421
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,280
And she always misses the capital.

422
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,730
She cries and has a fever every time she's anxious.

423
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,840
I've reminded her many times.

424
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:23,300
But her intelligence quotient is really limited.

425
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:26,860
Actually, Her Highness is quite smart.

426
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,270
It's just that there are so many things to learn.

427
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,080
She doesn't know where she should start.

428
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,990
Ms. Ming and I

429
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:38,640
will try harder tomorrow to teach Her Highness.

430
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,090
Yes.

431
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:46,890
What do you plan to teach Her Highness?

432
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,560
The grudges between Wu and the State of An

433
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:55,100
and the general resume of the officials above the third rank of the State of An.

434
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,970
The temperament of the emperor of An,

435
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,110
the situation of the harem,

436
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,600
and the situations of the princes.

437
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:03,580
That's it?

438
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,060
That's all?

439
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,110
You don't plan to tell her about Scarlet Guards?

440
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:10,970
You don't plan to tell her

441
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,050
how many parties there are in the court of the State of An?

442
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,860
You don't plan to tell her

443
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,350
what we should do if someone deliberately makes things difficult

444
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,330
after we arrive in the State of An?

445
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,810
You only plan to tell her about the situations of the officials above the third rank.

446
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,070
Let me remind you.

447
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:24,980
General Zhongwu, Marquis Changqing,

448
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,830
who captured His Majesty,

449
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,280
is just a sub-third-rank official.

450
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:28,970
How dare you!

451
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,350
You are disrespectful.

452
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:32,230
His Majesty just went north to hunt.

453
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:43,550
Fine.

454
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,490
Go on. What else do you plan to teach her?

455
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,400
Her Majesty was worried that Her Highness can't remember all of them if we teach too many things.

456
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,860
So she asked me to teach Her Highness the most important things.

457
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,370
After all, the duty of Her Highness

458
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,010
is just to pay the ransom.

459
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,820
Mr. Du will be responsible for the negotiation with the State of An.

460
00:24:58,770 --> 00:24:59,390
That's right.

461
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,420
In the eyes of the people,

462
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,200
Prince Li has been ignorant of politics since childhood.

463
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,140
If she is too smart,

464
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,690
it will make An people suspect her.

465
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,170
If Prince Li

466
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,610
is someone who easily cries,

467
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,900
do you think whether An people will suspect her or not?

468
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,200
What do you plan to tell Her Highness

469
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,750
about Noble Consort Chu of the State of An?

470
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,170
Noble Consort Chu?

471
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,160
Noble Consort Chu is Duke Chu's little sister.

472
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,610
She went into the imperial palace 3 years ago and is the emperor's favorite.

473
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,160
She likes horse riding and archery, and she's good at seducing men.

474
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:29,710
Enough.

475
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:31,470
Thank you.

476
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:33,370
Mr. Du,

477
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,230
how do you plan to negotiate with An people

478
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,830
after we arrive in the State of An?

479
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,230
I will make them understand with reason and move them with emotion.

480
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,810
And of course, I'll give them the ransom.

481
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,770
If they still won't let him go

482
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,710
after you do these things,

483
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,760
and they even detain everyone in the delegation,

484
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,350
what should we do?

485
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,580
If this really happens,

486
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,380
I will go straight to the court

487
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,450
and criticize the emperor of the State of An for going back on his word

488
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:04,170
in front of the officials of the State of An.

489
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,500
And then I'll die calmly

490
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,290
to prove my loyalty to His Majesty.

491
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,190
That's right.

492
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,030
Since we left the capital,

493
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,250
we've known that we may not be able to go back.

494
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:29,260
Well said.

495
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,410
Where are our rooms?

496
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,740
Go straight to the court and criticizing the emperor of An?

497
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,330
He must have read too many novels. How can he do that?

498
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,970
If An people want to make things difficult,

499
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,250
they just need

500
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,490
to put the delegation under house arrest in the posthouse.

501
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,070
None of us can get out.

502
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,880
Let's make a bet.

503
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,970
After our princess arrives in the State of An like this,

504
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:53,890
how many days will it take for them to find out her real identity?

505
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:54,770
I think it'll take 1 day.

506
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,300
Boss Ning is in charge now.

507
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,620
I think it'll take at least 2 days.

508
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,750
An hour at most.

509
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,530
This female official doesn't even respect Her Highness.

510
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,510
How can she teach her well?

511
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,270
The princess grew up in the cold palace.

512
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,370
She is so pitiful.

513
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,300
Look.

514
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,490
I knew you didn't ask me out because it's a simple task.

515
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,220
But Prince Danyang is really cunning.

516
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:17,200
He doesn't want Her Highness to go back,

517
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,630
but he doesn't want it to be too obvious either.

518
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,980
So he asked Chief Clerk Du here.

519
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:23,080
He is a loyal official, but is not flexible.

520
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,160
If we screw it up,

521
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,170
there will be nothing we can do.

522
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,650
What should we do?

523
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,500
What should we do?

524
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:36,170
We can't replace Chief Clerk Du.

525
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,350
We need to think of a way as soon as possible

526
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,090
to ask the empress

527
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,190
to send a competent female official here.

528
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,490
There is no one else.

529
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,450
There are only a few competent female officials in the palace.

530
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:46,660
Unless you want to make an excuse

531
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,340
to ask Ms. Pei, your childhood sweetheart, to come here.

532
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,480
Well...

533
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,680
But she seems to be engaged.

534
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,640
It's inappropriate, right?

535
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,120
Of course it's not appropriate.

536
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,010
Forget it.

537
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,950
It'll be nice

538
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,880
if a beauty

539
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,350
who knows everything about the State of An

540
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:18,600
comes to us now.

541
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,690
Take me with you.

542
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,880
I can do many things for you.

543
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,110
The first one.

544
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:31,150
I know a lot of things

545
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,130
in the harem and the court of the State of An.

546
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:35,630
Yuan Lu,

547
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,260
send a message to Jiang Qiong in the headquarters immediately.

548
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:39,950
Ask him to strictly interrogate Zhao Ji's followers recalled.

549
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,520
We must find out where Mr. Yue is.

550
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,130
Yes.

551
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:49,910
[Zhiyun Cloth Store]

552
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,330
Miss, please come in.

553
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:47,960
Xiaosi.

554
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,110
We have guests.

555
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,710
Okay.

556
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,720
Come in, please.

557
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,450
[Kaiyang Branch of Scarlet Guards]

558
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,480
I've sent shadow scouts.

559
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,530
My Lord, please rest assured.

560
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,710
Once that person shows up,

561
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,530
kill her.

562
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:08,730
But the people of Liudao Hall have all retreated.

563
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,100
I'm worried that something might happen.

564
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,360
Are you scared?

565
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:13,670
I dare not.

566
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,170
But...

567
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,730
you said the person who escaped

568
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:17,850
has All-Purpose Antidote.

569
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,380
Could she be a Purple Emissary?

570
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,840
[Scarlet Guard: Yu]

571
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,510
So what?

572
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,970
Even if she is a Scarlet Emissary,

573
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,370
she still has to die

574
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:29,810
since she has ruined our lord's plan.

575
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,130
Yes.

576
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,380
I'm gonna go take a look.

577
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,090
Miss, what kind of silk do you want?

578
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:50,700
Xiaosi.

579
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,410
I'm sorry.

580
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:55,850
Our shop is closed today.

581
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:56,980
I'm sorry.

582
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,970
In every palace hall the green moss grows.

583
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,100
Heaven would have grown old were it moved to emotions.

584
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,550
Lord Ren,

585
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,100
you are still alive.

586
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,630
This is great.

587
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,420
I need to send an urgent message back to the headquarters.

588
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:11,940
Do you have a pigeon?

589
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,600
Yes.

590
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:15,770
Let me take you to the secret chamber.

591
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:17,050
Please.

592
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:20,900
Please.

593
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,340
Who is she?

594
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,980
It's you.

595
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,940
You know her?

596
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:40,400
She's the star of Lanfang Pavilion on West Street.

597
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,380
She's good at oral stunts.

598
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,270
Tell me.

599
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,420
Why did you come here?

600
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,340
Why do you have the cypher? And how do you know the code words?

601
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,490
This morning,

602
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,050
a woman gave me a tael of gold.

603
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,470
She asked me to learn some words from her

604
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,800
and then come here.

605
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,280
Oh no.

606
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:01,830
Oh no.

607
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:04,090
Left Emissary asked her here on purpose.

608
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,520
None of us can live now.

609
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,760
Left Emissary?

610
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,250
Left Emissary Chen?

611
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:10,760
No.

612
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:12,810
It's...

613
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:16,040
It's Ren Xin, Left Emissary Ren.

614
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,130
Impossible. She died long ago.

615
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:25,400
Take me back to An Capital. Now!

616
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,000
My Lord, who is Ren Xin?

617
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,170
Don't mention her name.

618
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,320
We are lucky enough

619
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,710
that we can go back to the State of An safely

620
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,280
with these gold.

621
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:38,720
Why are you so afraid of her?

622
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,170
You've only joined Scarlet Guards for 2 years.

623
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:44,860
Of course you don't know how scary she was.

624
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,170
In the eyes of our generation of Scarlet Guards,

625
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,860
she is a legend.

626
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:53,790
Back then,

627
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,170
[The young Ren Xin]

628
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,060
she was just an ordinary Scarlet Guard.

629
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,690
But she made great contributions to the State of An

630
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,630
as she fought against foreign enemies.

631
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:00,790
Because of this, Commander

632
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,510
promoted her as a Purple Emissary directly.

633
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,320
She is the most successful assassin

634
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,840
in the history of Scarlet Guards.

635
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,040
As long as it's her,

636
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,840
there's nothing she can't accomplish.

637
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:15,930
Prince Xin of Nanping and Empress Dowager Yuan of the State of Chu

638
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,120
were both killed by her.

639
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:21,270
Later, she conquered

640
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:23,270
the military governors of Fengxiang, Dingnan, and Baosheng

641
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,400
in a row within a month.

642
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:29,230
His Majesty personally named her Left Emissary of the headquarters.

643
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,000
But why have I never heard of her?

644
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,350
She suddenly had an evil intention 5 years ago.

645
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,270
She went to assassinate Empress Zhaojie.

646
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,060
After she was arrested, she burnt herself in the imperial prison.

647
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,110
His Majesty was furious

648
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:46,800
and issued an imperial edict to crush her bones.

649
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:48,030
He also ordered everyone

650
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,460
not to mention her name again.

651
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,950
But I never thought

652
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,200
she is still alive.

653
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,540
What's going on?

654
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:22,510
Yu.

655
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,170
You lured me here on purpose.

656
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,490
I was foolish.

657
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,330
You are alone in the dark.

658
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,100
I am in the light and have many followers.

659
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,810
You deliberately lured me out of the branch in Kaiyang.

660
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,390
Then you attacked me halfway. You got me at one blow.

661
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,170
Left Emissary Ren, you deserve your reputation.

662
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:57,550
Who are you?

663
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,790
I'm Yue Sanniang, a Purple Emissary of the branch in the State of Wu.

664
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,990
When you were in trouble in Yaoyue Pavilion,

665
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,190
I was just an ordinary Scarlet Guard.

666
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,090
I didn't have the chance to be summoned by you.

667
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,090
Since you know me,

668
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,949
you should know what I'm capable of.

669
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:12,810
Tell me.

670
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,600
As the head of the branch in the State of Wu,

671
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:17,620
why did you betray your followers

672
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,710
and make 47 people of the Wu Capital Branch

673
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:20,850
lose their lives?

674
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,420
I dare not act on my own.

675
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,820
This was an order from the headquarters.

676
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,360
My life is in danger. Why would I lie to you?

677
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:32,880
Last year, the Wu Capital Branch

678
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,040
received 2,000 taels of gold through me

679
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,830
to bribe Eunuch Hu, who serves the emperor of Wu.

680
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:39,860
But it's 5,000 taels of gold

681
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:41,889
on the account book of the headquarters.

682
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:44,230
Someone in the headquarters committed corruption?

683
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:45,949
Yes.

684
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:47,590
A Purple Emissary in the Wu Capital Branch

685
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,300
found out about this.

686
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:51,110
The headquarters was afraid of her reporting this,

687
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:52,719
so they ordered me to kill her.

688
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,429
In order to complete the mission perfectly,

689
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:56,870
I asked Liudao Hall for a collaboration.

690
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,990
They also wanted to take this opportunity to make contributions.

691
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,630
So we reached a partnership.

692
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,550
The people of Liudao Hall gave you 3,000 taels

693
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,670
in exchange for the lives of 47 people.

694
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:11,920
Ms. Yue,

695
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:15,210
that was really a good deal.

696
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:18,830
Please forgive me.

697
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,810
Don't you want to know

698
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,820
who committed corruption in the headquarters?

699
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:26,710
Will you tell me?

700
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:32,790
As long as you spare my life,

701
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,190
I'll tell you everything I know.

702
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,240
That person is...

703
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:50,170
You can't even hold your sword steadily.

704
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,810
Looks like the efficacy of the All-Purpose Antidote still exists.

705
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:55,280
You really don't have any internal force.

706
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,150
Kill her!

707
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:08,470
Ruyi.

708
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,160
Who is that person in the headquarters?

709
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,070
I won't tell you.

710
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,860
If he can't reach me,

711
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,240
he will naturally find out about you.

712
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,000
You went to catch up with the princess, right?

713
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,390
Why are you here?

714
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,940
We were worried about you.

715
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,760
So we specially came to you.

716
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,400
So you've realized you need me?

717
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,790
And you regret not making a deal with me?

718
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:32,660
Anyway,

719
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:36,410
do as you said that day.

720
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:39,400
You teach Her Highness everything about the State of An.

721
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:41,260
And I will help you find out

722
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,920
who killed your benefactor.

723
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:44,990
I've changed the price.

724
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,320
You also need to send someone to Shengzhou

725
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:48,300
to take my godmother

726
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:50,350
to her parents' home in Fu County and help her settle down,

727
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:53,100
and ensure my safety before I arrive in An Capital.

728
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:54,510
No problem.

729
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:57,100
But I need to check the result first.

730
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,460
Before we enter the State of An,

731
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,860
if what you teach Her Highness

732
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,970
can't meet my standards,

733
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,560
our deal will be canceled.

734
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,500
You didn't even pay the deposit.

735
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,390
Do you want to get something for nothing?

736
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,690
I saved your life just now.

737
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:11,890
This is the deposit.

738
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,210
And you said

739
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,330
you hate owing other people favors, right?

740
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,550
Deal.

741
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,560
But I want you to swear.

742
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,630
Well, you really believe this?

743
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:26,890
Yes.

744
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:30,510
I want you to swear in the name of your brothers in Heaven Path.

745
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:33,940
Fine.

746
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,840
I, Ning Yuanzhou, Chief of Liudao Hall,

747
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:41,120
swear in the name of my brothers in Heaven Path who died for their county

748
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,380
that I will abide by my agreement with Ruyi.

749
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:44,750
If I break my promise,

750
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,330
all my brothers in Heaven Path will be in Avici forever

751
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,080
and can never clear their names.

752
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:53,760
Are you satisfied now?

753
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,260
Say it again.

754
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,520
My real name is not Ruyi.

755
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:58,620
My name is Ren Xin.

756
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:01,560
Xin as in the 10 Heavenly Stems.

757
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:05,890
You are Ren Xin?

758
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:07,900
Yes.

759
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,870
When I died 5 years ago,

760
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,560
I don't think you were Deputy Chief.

761
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,720
You were just the head of Hell Path.

762
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,210
Isn't Ren Xin a man?

763
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:18,490
He's 6 feet tall and has a scar on his face.

764
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:21,600
That's the identity I used to assassinate the empress dowager of the State of Chu.

765
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,330
It was just a human skin mask.

766
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,630
Liudao Hall doesn't have this kind of thing?

767
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:25,760
We have.

768
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:27,170
Yu is very good at making them.

769
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:32,960
Looks like

770
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,820
Hell Path and Palace of Hell

771
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:37,300
are not as powerful as Zhang Song said.

772
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,690
There are a lot of things you can't find out.

773
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,840
I kind of regret making this deal.

774
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,210
But now,

775
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,010
you don't have a choice.

776
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:04,350
Let's go, Yuan Lu.

777
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,000
Okay.

778
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:11,240
Ren Xin is Ruyi.

779
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,600
This is great.

780
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,740
Ruyi once disguised herself as a man.

781
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,810
If we ask Ruyi to teach Her Highness,

782
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,690
she will definitely not give herself away.

783
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,680
[Guideyuan, the State of An]

784
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,840
This time, Tongguang

785
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,790
captured the emperor of Wu alive.

786
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,550
You made great contributions.

787
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:44,850
You haven't been rewarded yet.

788
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,190
I'm promoting you as the first-rank marquis,

789
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:48,870
General of Yulin Guards.

790
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:58,170
-Nice archery skills.
-Nice archery skills.

791
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,460
Congratulations on your promotion today, Marquis.

792
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,440
General of Yulin Guards

793
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:03,650
is His Majesty's most trusted aide.

794
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:04,430
Yes.

795
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:06,530
Everyone knows that His Majesty has always treated Marquis

796
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:07,730
like his own son, right?

797
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:11,420
Marquis.

798
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:13,010
An attendant of Prince Luoxi

799
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,530
has the bird over there.

800
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,020
[Li Tongguang's attendant: Zhu Yin]

801
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:15,310
He just wouldn't give it to me.

802
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,440
I promoted him

803
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:42,890
just to stimulate my 2 sons.

804
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:44,650
Every time I went out to battle,

805
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:47,200
these 2 boys became restless.

806
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,880
Marquis Changqing is just a stone.

807
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:52,150
I want to use him

808
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,700
to sharpen the knives.

809
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:55,930
I see.

810
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:58,660
I asked him to be in charge of Yulin Guards

811
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,820
[Commander of Scarlet Guards: Deng Hui]

812
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:01,600
in order to keep him in the capital.

813
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:05,470
If not so, should I promote him as a military governor

814
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,460
to let him leave the capital and gain military power?

815
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:16,910
Your Majesty, someone was behind the tree just now.

816
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:18,990
It was Marquis Changqing.

817
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:21,110
He heard it, right?

818
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,410
I let him hear it on purpose.

819
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:38,880
Jerk! You can't even retrieve a bird!

820
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,720
What on earth happened?

821
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,050
I saw you getting angry at the servants.

822
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:51,030
I was worried.

823
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:52,790
So I made an excuse and came here immediately.

824
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,600
Nothing.

825
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:00,010
Tell me.

826
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,370
Otherwise, I'll be angry.

827
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:06,690
He just promoted me,

828
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,140
but he deliberately spoke ill of me behind my back.

829
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,150
It's nothing.

830
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,670
After all, being promoted is a good thing.

831
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:24,210
Besides,

832
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:27,140
you need to put up with it for the moment.

833
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:31,340
I know.

834
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,670
He deliberately let me hear it.

835
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:35,930
So I had to get mad on purpose.

836
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,870
If I put up with it like I did at the banquet,

837
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:41,000
he'll be increasingly wary of me, right?

838
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:43,860
You

839
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,070
are too deep.

840
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,360
If I'm not deep

841
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:50,320
and I don't always keep a clear head,

842
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,840
how can we achieve our ambition?

843
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:00,870
I hope you lose your mind.

844
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,130
Lose your mind to me.

845
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:07,730
Li Tongguang,

846
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:10,600
you know I'm fascinated by you.

847
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:12,690
But I'm not a fool.

848
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:15,150
All this time,

849
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:17,980
you've never wanted to get close to me.

850
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:25,670
You think I'm dirty,

851
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:26,760
right?

852
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:34,710
Kill her.

853
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:36,040
Otherwise, both of us will die.

854
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,910
M-Marquis.

855
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,000
Marquis.

856
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:47,680
Marquis.

857
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,700
M-Marquis.

858
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:54,580
Marquis.

859
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:00,630
Marquis, please spare my life.

860
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:05,590
Please spare my life, Marquis.

861
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:06,350
Close your eyes.

862
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:08,470
Don't kill me. I won't tell anyone.

863
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:09,710
It'll be over soon.

864
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,480
Jiu, please spare my life.

865
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:20,770
What did you call me?

866
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:22,780
I'm Liu Li.

867
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,570
[Former maid in Scarlet Guards: Liu Li]

868
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:25,690
I was with Lord and served you 9 years ago.

869
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:39,650
[The young Liu Li]

870
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,350
[The young Li Tongguang]

871
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,150
Remember this humiliation.

872
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:52,920
And you won't lose next time.
