[Episode 20]

4
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,170
No matter who it is,

5
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,289
as long as they get near the posthouse,

6
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,390
you must check them carefully.

7
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:51,870
Yes.

8
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:52,729
Oh, right.

9
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,570
Especially women.

10
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:55,890
Yes, sir.

11
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,210
Sun Lang.

12
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:03,690
Qian.

13
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,130
Didn't I tell you to check them carefully?

14
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,130
What happened?

15
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,800
Did a sheep stop you in your tracks?

16
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:12,810
Mei...

17
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:13,690
There's no plump sheep.

18
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,330
Only this little sheep.

19
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,480
Do you want it?

20
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,770
I think she's just a sheep seller.

21
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:24,850
Yes.

22
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,650
Sun Lang, take her to receive payment for the sheep.

23
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:28,690
Yes.

24
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,480
Thank you.

25
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,130
Lord Ren.

26
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:39,940
I'm late.

27
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,250
Please forgive me.

28
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:42,850
You're not late at all.

29
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,270
You came at the right time.

30
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,810
Liu Li, who used to serve me...

31
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,010
I saw her too.

32
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,329
After bidding farewell to you the last time,

33
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,130
as per your orders,

34
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,430
I've been keeping a close eye on Scarlet Guards.

35
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,450
When I was rushing to He County yesterday,

36
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,770
I received a messenger pigeon from Jinbao Inn

37
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,770
of the State of An's Huzhou, about 70 miles away from here.

38
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,820
The owner said there's a woman staying there

39
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,080
who wears the old-style earrings of Scarlet Guards,

40
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,290
so he took note of her.

41
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,910
Later, an old guard recognized

42
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,090
that she's Liu Li who used to serve you.

43
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,090
I know

44
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,079
that after you faked your death,

45
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,360
Liu Li was expelled from Scarlet Guards.

46
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,890
I had a feeling that her sudden appearance now is not a coincidence,

47
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,810
so I changed my schedule

48
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,000
and rushed over to inquire about it.

49
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,190
Lin Lang?

50
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,160
Liu Li?

51
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,370
Unexpectedly, I hadn't gotten a few words in

52
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,290
before she started to probe me about

53
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,329
whether

54
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,570
you're still alive.

55
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:45,450
I pretended to be shocked to bait her.

56
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,170
Soon, she said

57
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,329
-that she's...
-She's with Li Tongguang now.

58
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,170
And Li Tongguang asked her to rush here

59
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,850
to confirm if I'm Ren Xin.

60
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,329
Just as you expected.

61
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,130
Then what did you tell her?

62
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,170
I just tactfully analyzed it for her

63
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,130
from her perspective.

64
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,630
I know

65
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,240
Liu Li had a tough time after leaving Scarlet Guards.

66
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,490
Marquis Changqing took her in

67
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:10,970
and even made her...

68
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,920
his personal attendant.

69
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,490
That's how I realized

70
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,610
that Little Marquis treats her well

71
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,959
only because

72
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,250
she was close to you back then.

73
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,580
But if you were still alive,

74
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,020
she'd have to take a step back.

75
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,210
With Liu Li's personality,

76
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,880
I'm afraid she took your harrowing words to heart.

77
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:32,930
No wonder,

78
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,370
when she saw me in An's Army Camp,

79
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,850
she wasn't that shocked.

80
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,500
I'm sure she'll be resolute when she tells Li Tongguang

81
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,810
that I'm just a look-alike of Ren Xin.

82
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,970
I owe it to your quick wit.

83
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:49,650
You flatter me.

84
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,120
I'm more than happy

85
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,800
that I could be of help to you.

86
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,930
But there's one thing

87
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,860
I still can't figure out.

88
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,520
With how well-informed

89
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,150
your Jinsha Pavilion is,

90
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,130
how did you not know

91
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,120
that Marquis Changqing is Jiu?

92
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,560
And why did you say nothing

93
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,730
when I mentioned him before?

94
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,610
I apologize for my wrongdoing.

95
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,040
I don't want an apology.

96
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,560
I want the reason.

97
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,490
Little Marquis has met you several times.

98
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,800
Can't you tell

99
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,530
he has ulterior motives for you?

100
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,170
It's not how a disciple regards his master,

101
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,800
but that of a man to a woman.

102
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,030
Little Marquis almost went crazy after you left.

103
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,120
No.

104
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,110
He'd already gone crazy.

105
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,810
Master!

106
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,070
Little Marquis thought you really

107
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,750
died in the imperial prison's fire,

108
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,680
so he disobeyed orders and bribed the guards

109
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,470
to sneak in every night

110
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,350
and dug through the ruins bit by bit by himself.

111
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,200
Fortunately, in order to help you escape back then,

112
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,190
I disguised the situation

113
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,430
by hiding some corpses in the ground.

114
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,600
Only then did he stop like he'd uncovered treasure.

115
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,230
[Tomb of Ren Xin, former Left Emissary of the State of An's Scarlet Guards]

116
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,570
The imperial court said you were a sinner who killed the late Empress

117
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,540
and forbade you to be buried.

118
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,260
Little Marquis secretly buried the fake bones

119
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,370
in a secret cave.

120
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,380
From then on, on the 15th of every month,

121
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,240
as long as he's in An Capital,

122
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:25,890
he'll go and pay his respects

123
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,310
without miss.

124
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,690
Previously, I thought

125
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,290
this was just his way of respecting his master.

126
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,290
But it was only after I joined Jinsha Sect

127
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,840
and accepted a job from Second Prince 
to investigate Marquis Changqing,

128
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,210
that I found out

129
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,690
he'd held the imperial painter, who'd met you, captive

130
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,890
and had many portraits of you painted, which he kept in his residence.

131
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,690
He also found all the clothes

132
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,860
you wore before,

133
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,120
to pay homage to you.

134
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,450
Besides, no matter who it was,

135
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:03,970
he refused all marriage proposals.

136
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,450
You think too much.

137
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,170
The reason he refused the marriages

138
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,070
is largely because of Princess Qingning.

139
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:10,850
Lord Ren.

140
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,250
Both you and I have been White Sparrows.

141
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,490
This is the most basic way a man expresses...

142
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,050
All right, enough.

143
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,730
So you saw

144
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,850
that I'm intimate with Ning Yuanzhou,

145
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,930
so you avoided mentioning Li Tongguang.

146
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:30,600
Yes.

147
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:32,909
Thank you.

148
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,780
But Ren Xin

149
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,840
is long gone.

150
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,590
Just like you, Meiniang,

151
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,250
who's no longer Lin Lang.

152
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:44,130
Scarlet Guards taught us a lot

153
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,850
and hurt us a lot.

154
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,130
We can't forget the past,

155
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,740
but we'll never go back to the past.

156
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,100
When I'm done with my matters,

157
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,770
I want to do something meaningful

158
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,450
like you.

159
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,530
If I could be of help to the former Scarlet Guards,

160
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,490
it'd be even better.

161
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,090
Sometimes, I also feel conflicted.

162
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,650
I'm trying to seek revenge from Scarlet Guards,

163
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,740
but I still want to help them.

164
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,290
Lord Ren, it's because you're compassionate.

165
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,420
I wonder what you want to do then?

166
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,330
I want to join too.

167
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,690
The reason a woman becomes a White Sparrow,

168
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,120
apart from having cruel parents,

169
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,630
is mostly that she had limited access to education since she was young.

170
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,320
She's naive and unable to protect herself.

171
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,810
That's why she's easily deceived.

172
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,970
So I want to gather the White Sparrows

173
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,580
who were abandoned by Scarlet Guards

174
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,490
and teach them how to make a living.

175
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,760
Good idea.

176
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,410
Can I lay claim to

177
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,370
being the abacus teacher first?

178
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,130
I can also...

179
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,210
Wait.

180
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:51,770
Can Mr. Ning

181
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,850
also teach them...

182
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:54,530
We...

183
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,290
We came all the way here.

184
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,090
But we don't know if we still can stay together

185
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,580
in the future.

186
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:07,410
That's not bad either.

187
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,750
Anyway, Mr. Ning is handsome.

188
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,330
No matter what, you won't lose out.

189
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,760
I know many

190
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,820
handsome and talented men too.

191
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,170
All kinds, from young and handsome,

192
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,690
to mature and dignified ones.

193
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,450
Don't let him hear this.

194
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,360
Otherwise, he'll tear down your Jinsha Pavilion.

195
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,260
As for General Yuan's matter,

196
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,200
Mr. Du, please write a letter

197
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,440
to Lingzhou's regional inspector.

198
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,810
After we bring His Majesty back to the capital,

199
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,770
it'd also be considered as their contribution.

200
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,490
Okay, I'll go now.

201
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,090
Why didn't anyone tell me Jin Meiniang's here?

202
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:56,560
Did your old injury flare up?

203
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,960
I'll go find Qian.

204
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,410
It's okay. It's an old ailment.

205
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,170
Don't tell the rest.

206
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,450
Don't hurt the army's morale.

207
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,090
Jin Meiniang isn't here for you.

208
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,340
She's here for Ruyi.

209
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,010
I know.

210
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,390
But you can't let them

211
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,580
stay together for too long.

212
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,050
You don't believe me?

213
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,210
Right now,

214
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,250
Jin Meiniang is full of weird ideas.

215
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,770
If you let her lead Beauty astray,

216
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,210
you two will...

217
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,330
Tell me.

218
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,410
What's so weird about me?

219
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,140
Boss.

220
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,120
Marquis Changqing is here.

221
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,760
He wants to see Ruyi,

222
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,980
His Highness, Chief Clerk Du,

223
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:42,290
and you.

224
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,060
I'll cut to the chase.

225
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,890
Previously, your princess suggested

226
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,130
that as long as I'm willing to help you

227
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,360
bring back your emperor of Wu,

228
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,250
you'll offer Yuncheng and Miancheng to me?

229
00:10:59,250 --> 00:10:59,970
That's right.

230
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:00,770
Fine.

231
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,570
I agree.

232
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,000
And I can guarantee

233
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,490
that you can succeed in a month.

234
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:07,730
Just tell me your conditions.

235
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:12,910
Give her to me.

236
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,370
And I'll make your wish come true.

237
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:20,290
How dare you!

238
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,280
Princess is my sister.

239
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,400
You're the ones begging me.

240
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,880
I'll give you one night to think about it.

241
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:32,610
Tomorrow at 10 a.m.,

242
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,790
you either send her to me

243
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,050
or

244
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,220
prepare to collect Yang Xingyuan's corpse.

245
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,170
Stop there!

246
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,630
Do you think you can insult Princess at will?

247
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,390
Mr. Ning.

248
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,210
Interesting.

249
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,670
You're asking for me,

250
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,000
but you don't even dare to look at me.

251
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:10,490
Turn around!

252
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,650
Look into my eyes.

253
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,300
Tell me.

254
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,360
What do you want me for?

255
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,810
Do you want to punish me to be a slave

256
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,130
to repay for your humiliation today,

257
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,860
or do you want me to be your shameful concubine

258
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,100
and entertain you every day?

259
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:39,410
No.

260
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,920
No way.

261
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,530
I'll be good to you.

262
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,700
How?

263
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,770
Will you ask the imperial painter to draw hundreds of portraits of me

264
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:47,890
and fill your secret room with them,

265
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,130
or will you dress me up in the Scarlet Guards'

266
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,340
old clothings

267
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,250
like I'm a live doll?

268
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,360
How do you know about that?

269
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,050
The entire Scarlet Guards' Wu Capital branch

270
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,130
was taken down by Liudao Hall.

271
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,050
Why do you think we don't know about that?

272
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,590
Li Tongguang.

273
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,910
Li Jiu.

274
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:09,820
You want me to go with you

275
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,010
just to be a substitute of that person.

276
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,170
If I lecture you like this,

277
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,740
has your wish come true?

278
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,010
How ridiculous

279
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:24,970
and preposterous.

280
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,890
Don't say that, Master.

281
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,010
I'll say it again.

282
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,390
I'm not your master.

283
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,720
I'm Princess Huyang of Wu.

284
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,250
What you thought was your biggest secret

285
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,050
was not protected well at all.

286
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,810
Who can you hide it from after you ask me to join you?

287
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,610
The two princes of the State of An

288
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,490
would be so happy to find out that you hid the enemy state's princess

289
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,250
in your residence.

290
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,350
King of An is so paranoid.

291
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,820
He neglected you for so long before he promoted you.

292
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,130
Yet you want everything to go back to where it started.

293
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,330
And what about your unmarried Princess Jin Ming?

294
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,650
Tell me.

295
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,610
If she suddenly finds out

296
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:07,440
she has a Wu princess as a sister,

297
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,400
she must be really delighted.

298
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,410
Aren't you stupid

299
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,280
for being so careless?

300
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,170
Have you forgotten what it took

301
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,770
for you to climb to this position?

302
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,430
Have you thought about how once you lose the emperor's trust,

303
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,190
you'll have to go back to living a life

304
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,560
where you're looked down upon by others?

305
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,010
Have you thought about

306
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,230
how disgusted your master will be

307
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:35,330
when she finds out

308
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,090
that you harbor shameful desires

309
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,790
towards her?

310
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,560
I don't.

311
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,570
I don't. I don't!

312
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:49,610
No?

313
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,720
Really?

314
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,850
I don't.

315
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,540
I don't.

316
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,310
It's resolved then.

317
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:28,570
Watch and learn.

318
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,250
An unbridled request

319
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,630
is often one's biggest weakness.

320
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,210
Ruyi. Ruyi.

321
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:00,690
What?

322
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,710
Did I say anything wrong?

323
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:06,290
No.

324
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,710
♫The sword reflects the cold radiance of the frost in the passes and mountains♫

325
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:09,650

♫We were once in love♫

332

Don't do this.

You can't

solve our problem like this.

355
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:28,369

General Wu is still waiting at the army camp.

372
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,810
Stop talking and get in the carriage first.

373
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:55,770
Keep it a secret.

374
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:18,770
She said

375
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,910
I harbor shameful desires for Master.

376
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:27,770
They're talking nonsense.

377
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,330
You only have

378
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,790
admiration for Lord Ren.

379
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:35,810
There are assassins!

380
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,450
Their formation is like Scarlet Guards' Flying Flower Formation.

381
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,830
The southwest position is generally the weakest.

382
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:06,870
Scarlet Guards?

383
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,290
Let's fight first.

384
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,660
Here. Get up.

385
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:47,970
You're hurt.

386
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:49,570
-To save me…
-Enough.

387
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:52,850
Attack!

388
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,210
Why are there still so many people?

389
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,160
Attack!

390
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,580
Release the whistling arrow!

391
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,210
Yes, sir!

392
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,410
A whistling arrow warning?

393
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:32,890
Marquis Changqing is in trouble.

394
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,850
It's of the An Army style.

395
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,010
It's about a mile away from here.

396
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,130
The He County's office and army camp are within three miles.

397
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,290
It's Jiu...

398
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:51,570
It's Li Tongguang.

399
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,500
I'm aware of his martial arts skills.

400
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,880
He's not much weaker than Qian Zhao.

401
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,450
If they were bandits,

402
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,310
he wouldn't have asked for help with the whistling arrow.

403
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,660
Okay, let's get ready

404
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,700
to go and save him.

405
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:02,690
Save him?

406
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,380
Does he need our help, Boss?

407
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,410
The An people can see the whistling arrow too.

408
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,160
An people are further away as compared to us.

409
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:09,970
Besides, if they're martial arts experts,

410
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,490
it's useless for ordinary soldiers to go there.

411
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:12,800
If we don't save him

412
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,870
and something happens to him,

413
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,340
the peace talks will be affected.

414
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,570
But if we save his life,

415
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:20,090
Li Tongguang will owe us a big favor.

416
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,030
Any other questions?

417
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,290
No.

418
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,300
Shisan. Sun Lang.

419
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:25,890
Take some men with you and follow me.

420
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:26,570
Yes.

421
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:27,970
Yuan Lu. Qian Zhao.

422
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,790
Stay at the posthouse and protect His Highness.

423
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:31,740
Yes.

424
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,110
Take care of His Highness for me.

425
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,130
Yes, Lord Ren.

426
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,210
Ruyi.

427
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:37,800
Thunderbombs.

428
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:38,930
Thank you.

429
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,390
Let's go.

430
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:41,510
Thank you.

431
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,210
Attention!

432
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,110
Set out!

433
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:58,600
Yes, sir!

434
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,650
It sounds like it's right in front of us.

435
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,010
You can't expose your identity.

436
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,070
It's enough for us to go.

437
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,410
Don't worry.

438
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:15,970
I won't let anything happen to him.

439
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,610
Be careful.

440
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:20,430
Let's go.

441
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:41,970
Liu Li!

442
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:06,850
I don't need you to interfere.

443
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:38,990
Soft scale armor?

444
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,490
Sun Lang, go release the whistling arrow.

445
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:47,770
The rest of you,

446
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,130
aim accurately at the neck joint and kill!

447
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:50,650
Attack!

448
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:51,470
Yes, sir!

449
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,480
Hurry and hide!

450
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:49,490
Ning!

451
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:50,830
Ning!

452
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:00,710
Thunderbombs?

453
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,050
They were given by Yuan Lu.

454
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,170
Go to the fake mountain in the north

455
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:04,850
and kill the one who used the hidden weapon!

456
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:12,340
Go help her now.

457
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:13,870
No, your health...

458
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:14,680
It's an old injury. I'm fine.

459
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,260
Go.

460
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:16,670
Go!

461
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:43,730
Hurry! Thunderbombs!

462
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,570
I've used up everything Yuan Lu gave me.

463
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,840
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

464
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:48,500
Watch out!

465
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,650
Continue with the attack!

466
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,160
The leader is over there. Capture the leader first!

467
00:26:59,330 --> 00:26:59,980
No!

468
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:19,790
Stop him!

469
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:56,570
Yuanzhou!

470
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,930
Boss Ning! Boss Ning!

471
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:02,320
Boss! Boss Ning!

472
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:03,450
Ning! Boss Ning!

473
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,690
Ning! Ning! Boss Ning!

474
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:14,930
Yuanzhou.

475
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,600
Princess, why are you here?

476
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:27,650
Master.

477
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:33,210
The one with the blue scarf

478
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:34,490
is the leader.

479
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:39,810
I'm fine.

480
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:41,810
Yuan Lu.

481
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:43,170
Thunderbombs!

482
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,160
Yuanzhou.

483
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,340
Who killed their leader?

484
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,050
I killed your leader!

485
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:12,890
It's him!

486
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,330
Surrender now!

487
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,690
Retreat! Retreat!

488
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,130
Don't chase desperate foes!

489
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:26,610
Boss Ning!

490
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,350
Boss! Boss Ning!

491
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,020
Ning!

492
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,080
Yuanzhou!

493
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:30,740
Here.

494
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,750
What's the relationship between Princess and Ning Yuanzhou?

495
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,250
It's none of your business.

496
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,170
I'm not worried no matter what their relationship is.

497
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,610
Ning Yuanzhou has vomited so much blood.

498
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,310
He's bound to die.

499
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:52,940
Marquis!

500
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,400
She can only be mine.

501
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:06,730
No one can take her away from me.

502
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:17,810
How is he?

503
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,660
I'm not confident at all.

504
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:22,850
He was poisoned,

505
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,000
but I don't know what poison it is.

506
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,650
Ten-Day Qianji.

507
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:35,490
He was poisoned by Ten-Day Qianji.

508
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,220
The antidote for this episode hasn't been used yet.

509
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,450
It's a secret medicine from the previous dynasty.

510
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,640
Why would he take that?

511
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:43,810
To control him, Zhang Song

512
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,330
forced him to take it before we set off.

513
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:46,850
Every ten days,

514
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,770
we've to get the antidote from his men.

515
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,810
Zheng Qingyun and Li Tongguang's matters

516
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:51,730
delayed our schedule.

517
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,160
The antidote for this episode

518
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,040
was supposed to be in Junzhou of the State of An.

519
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,850
When Ten-Day Qianji is triggered,

520
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,420
it causes heart-gnawing pain.

521
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,760
Ordinary people can't bear it.

522
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,000
How did he hide it for so long?

523
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,110
Let's not talk about this first.

524
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:08,850
Is there any way to detoxify him?

525
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:11,610
Ten-Day Qianji

526
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:13,960
requires a special antidote.

527
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,300
I have no other solution.

528
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:26,450
Impossible.

529
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,650
Didn't a large batch of medicinal herbs

530
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,170
just arrive from Mishan Town?

531
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:32,620
Let's go back to the posthouse now.

532
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:33,410
There must be a way...

533
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,090
It's useless!

534
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,330
I wanted to take a gamble

535
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,870
and reduce the toxicity in his body through bloodletting.

536
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,720
But he's seriously injured now.

537
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,700
He can’t lose any more blood.

538
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,670
Think again, Qian.

539
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:49,170
Think again. There must be another way.

540
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:49,970
Think again!

541
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:51,010
Yes, Qian.

542
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,370
Let's think of other ways.

543
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:54,770
If bloodletting doesn't work,

544
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:56,690
why don't we do a blood transfusion?

545
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,220
Give my blood to Boss Ning.

546
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,130
I have a lot of blood. Take mine...

547
00:32:59,150 --> 00:32:59,980
I have blood too!

548
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,370
But how?

549
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:03,180
Should we cut open his pulse?

550
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:04,690
He'll just bleed even more!

551
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,170
How much time do we have?

552
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,490
An hour at most.

553
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,880
Luckily, he fell asleep.

554
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,810
He won't feel the pain.

555
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,420
Ask someone to bring Ying here.

556
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:52,210
At least let her see him for the last time.

557
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:58,650
Mr. Qian.

558
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,130
Is there an elixir that cures all poisons?

559
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:02,980
I'll go find it now.

560
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,530
You can't find it.

561
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:07,730
Even if we find it,

562
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,130
it'll be too late.

563
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:21,900
An elixir that cures all poisons?

564
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:30,810
What are you doing?

565
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:31,650
-Ruyi! 
-Ruyi!

566
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:32,969
I have Scarlet Guards' All-Purpose Antidote in my blood.

567
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,449
Even your Liudao Hall's Antiaris poison

568
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:35,130
can be removed.

569
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:13,850
Marquis.

570
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:16,650
You must cure her.

571
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,150
Yes.

572
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:19,890
No one survived?

573
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:21,730
We were surrounded by a few people,

574
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:22,930
but they all killed themselves.

575
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:24,930
I shall take my leave.

576
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:26,740
Wait.

577
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:31,190
Do you have any useful medicine?

578
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:32,450
Send some to them.

579
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,970
I only brought Incision Wound Medicine.

580
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:37,920
You may leave.

581
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,500
Yes.

582
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,730
Marquis, why...

583
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,570
I want Ning Yuanzhou to die,

584
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:51,070
but I'm afraid that if something happens to him,

585
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,700
Princess Huyang will hate me.

586
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,570
This is a gift from Duke Chu,

587
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:58,170
the Gengshi Pill.

588
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,220
Liu Li and I were able to recover

589
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,140
after taking this.

590
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:15,900
How is it?

591
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,580
Ning! Ning!

592
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:24,130
Boss! Boss Ning!

593
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:24,690
Yuanzhou.

594
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:36,710
Yuanzhou.

595
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,520
Ning!

596
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:38,610
Boss Ning.

597
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,040
Boss.

598
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:41,160
Yuanzhou.

599
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:48,980
Qian Zhao.

600
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:50,690
Yes.

601
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,850
Take my place

602
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:54,930
and head to Junzhou in the State of An

603
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,650
to plant the reincarnation flag.

604
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,830
The guys over there

605
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,710
are Zhang Song's men.

606
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,680
We've to let them know what's going on here.

607
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:10,850
Understand?

608
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:12,770
Yes.

609
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:13,920
Don't talk first.

610
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,150
Save your strength, you hear me?

611
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:15,910
Listen to me.

612
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:17,690
Boss, take a rest first.

613
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:18,750
Stop talking nonsense.

614
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:21,410
Ruyi.

615
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,150
I'm here. I'm here.

616
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,890
Let's not talk about this first.

617
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:28,370
Continue to drink my blood.

618
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:29,330
There's the All-Purpose Antidote in it.

619
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,420
No, it's useless.

620
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,490
I know

621
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:35,810
my condition.

622
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:37,810
I don't care.

623
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:39,360
You must get better.

624
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,310
Do you hear me?

625
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:45,570
I'm sorry.

626
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,220
I was momentarily careless.

627
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:54,990
If you know you're sorry,

628
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,510
you must get well soon.

629
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,690
Do you hear me?

630
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:00,370
I'm sorry.

631
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:04,370
I...

632
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,210
I was too foolish.

633
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:13,180
With you, I still...

634
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,210
insisted upon...

635
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:18,450
those...

636
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,450
those meaningless things.

637
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:23,970
I won't let you die.

638
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:28,610
Don't scare me.

639
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:30,970
I...

640
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,260
I've let you down.

641
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,000
I'm sorry.

642
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:55,970
Take this.

643
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,120
In the future, when you're unhappy,

644
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:05,650
remember to eat a big piece.

645
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:15,650
Okay.

646
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,580
If you die,

647
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,970
I'll give others the big pieces.

648
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:29,900
-Boss Ning!
-Ning! 
-Yuanzhou!

649
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,450
Boss Ning!

650
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,050
Ning! Ning!

651
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,330
Ning Yuanzhou!

652
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:36,690
Boss! Boss!

653
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:37,800
Ning Yuanzhou!

654
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,220
Boss Ning.

655
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:41,730
Ning Yuanzhou!

656
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,080
I have Gengshi Pill,

657
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,330
the Shaxi Tribe's elixir.

658
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,380
Wait.

659
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,100
We need to examine it first.

660
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:54,070
If it's poisonous, I'll die with him.

661
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,140
You're obviously not that cold-hearted.

662
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,380
Why are you so harsh with your words?

663
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:22,380
Go back and check the identities of those men in black.

664
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:23,930
They're definitely not Wu people!

665
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,770
His pulse is stable.

666
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:40,130
Send him back.

667
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,100
Slowly. Come on.

668
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,250
Help him up.

669
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,610
Will Yuanzhou wake up?

670
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:35,890
He will.

671
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:42,900
If he doesn't wake up,

672
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,550
I'll kill him.

673
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,160
What do you think? Isn't it lifelike?

674
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:12,410
♫If the world is like a wave♫

That's great.

699

You're awake.

700
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:31,410
Have a good rest.

Ruyi.
