[Episode 23]

4
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,310
I made it.

5
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,289
I did what you told me before

6
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,190
and turned the tables.

7
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,140
I... I didn't bring shame on myself.

8
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,490
Ruyi, you know what?

9
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,360
I imitated you.

10
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,850
I stared at that vice minister like this,

11
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,210
and he didn't dare to speak.

12
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,330
I... I was so cool.

13
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,700
I was really...

14
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:17,980
Your Highness, you indeed were cool today.

15
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,610
You faced everything alone

16
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,810
and you managed to send them away properly.

17
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,090
You are really brave and resourceful.

18
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,090
You know when you should compromise and when you shouldn't. You showed Wu's demeanour.

19
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,210
-Your Highness, you are so cool.
-Your Highness, you're awesome.

20
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,550
Thank you. Thank you.

21
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,050
But...

22
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,490
what should we do

23
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,570
if the emperor of An still ignores us after three days?

24
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,370
Should we really leave?

25
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,170
It won't happen.

26
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:44,500
His...

27
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,910
The emperor of An likes to use both tough and soft methods

28
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,810
and be both harsh and gentle.

29
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:50,510
Today, you got the cold shoulder

30
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,450
from him.

31
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,370
He'll probably come to see you tomorrow,

32
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,730
so that he can personally find out what you're capable of.

33
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,130
Really?

34
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,010
Your Highness,

35
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,370
I also want to know

36
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:06,690
what else happened

37
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,610
in the palace today.

38
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,090
When I

39
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,090
just arrived there,

40
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,170
I didn't see anyone.

41
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,010
I was scared as no one was there.

42
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,210
Later, I forced myself to sit.

43
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,320
I told myself to be tough.

44
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:36,490
Is Ying asleep?

45
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:37,570
Yes.

46
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,890
Ying got up at midnight yesterday.

47
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,770
She had a tough day in the palace today.

48
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,170
She ate something just now

49
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,690
and told us something about the palace. Then she went to bed.

50
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:52,910
What happened to your hand?

51
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,650
When you were not here today,

52
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,610
I disguised myself as a carter from the crematory

53
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,730
and went out to look into the situation.

54
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,290
I accidentally hurt my hand when I was tying the rope.

55
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,650
Let me apply some medicine for you.

56
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,310
No need. The skin is not broken.

57
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,040
Don't worry.

58
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,690
You can't even bear to see this?

59
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,680
What if something happens to me

60
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,690
when I go to the Scarlet Guards

61
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,330
tomorrow?

62
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,890
I'll marry another girl

63
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,409
and have many children with her.

64
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:41,659
-And I'll grow old with her.
-Ning Yuanzhou.

65
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,810
So don't give me this chance.

66
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,480
I don't want to hear you say anything

67
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,950
about you getting hurt.

68
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,710
You said

69
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,110
you'll be with me forever.

70
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,980
I didn't mean it.

71
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,000
I know.

72
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:14,970
I know you are an assassin.

73
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:16,810
In order to complete your mission,

74
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,410
you can sacrifice your life.

75
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,130
But you're not alone now.

76
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,920
You said you want to take revenge.

77
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,400
Fine. I'll let you do it.

78
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,810
You said you want to go to the Scarlet Guards.

79
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,080
I won't stop you.

80
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,910
But I can't bear to see you injured.

81
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,560
I can't bear

82
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,430
to see you don't care about your life.

83
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,190
I really...

84
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,740
Alright.

85
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,250
Stop nagging.

86
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,290
I'll come back safely.

87
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,610
If we quarrel in the future,

88
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,230
you can make me shut up in this way.

89
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,110
In the future, if you dare

90
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,130
to talk about another woman in front of me,

91
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,500
I promise you won't even have a chance to speak.

92
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,610
My bad. I won't do it again.

93
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:09,690
That's more like it.

94
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,790
You don't have taboos when you are with Yuan Lu and the others.

95
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,250
But now you're taking what I said so seriously.

96
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,410
We martial artists

97
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,970
don't have any taboo except our fatal points.

98
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,290
But...

99
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,890
I have you now.

100
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,250
You are my weakness.

101
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,409
You've learned a lot from Yu Shisan.

102
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,250
Do I need to learn from Yu Shisan?

103
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,320
Don't worry too much.

104
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,130
I may not do it tomorrow.

105
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,290
After all, I need to find out

106
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,250
who killed my godmother and Ling Long first.

107
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,370
When Jiu entered the palace today,

108
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,330
he probably told His Majesty

109
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,890
the Scarlet Guards attacked him.

110
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,100
But the Scarlet Guards hasn't done anything.

111
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,770
I think Deng Hui is probably not in the capital today.

112
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,440
That's why His Majesty didn't summon him.

113
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,010
He took over the Scarlet Guards

114
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,320
after you left Liudao Hall.

115
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,770
Even you don't know his background.

116
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:20,570
So I'd better do it

117
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,690
when he's not in the Scarlet Guards.

118
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:24,690
That's good.

119
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,970
The emperor of An will probably summon us again tomorrow.

120
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,450
If so, I need to go with Ying.

121
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,290
Take the tracker butterfly with you when you leave.

122
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,510
If anything happens, use the tracker butterfly to ask for help.

123
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,040
Don't worry about dragging me down at the critical moment of life and death.

124
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,159
I'll arrange everything.

125
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,070
Look.

126
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,610
It would be great

127
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,780
if we discuss everything like this. Right?

128
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,050
Then discuss with me

129
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,050
about your rescue mission, okay?

130
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,400
At least I can ensure Ying's safety

131
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,280
when you save him.

132
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:03,520
Okay.

Leave. All of you.

Yes.

139
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,190
Give me an explanation.

140
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,250
I didn't do it.

141
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,530
Your Majesty, you asked me to take charge of the Scarlet Guards.

142
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,370
So it's my fault for not disciplining my subordinates well.

143
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,130
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

144
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,970
Even if Marquis Changqing is a dog,

145
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,650
he is still my dog.

146
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,750
Scarlet Guards are my private soldiers.

147
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,580
How dare they make trouble under my nose!

148
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,820
If you can't find out the truth,

149
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,290
you should die

150
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,540
with your subordinates.

151
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:54,690
Okay.

152
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,530
In addition,

153
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:00,500
you must find out the truth

154
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,530
about the collusion between the Scarlet Guards and Beipan people.

155
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:04,690
Okay.

156
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:09,690
Although what Li Tongguang said is a bit exaggerated,

157
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,130
in this matter,

158
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:16,810
I don't think he has the guts to make things up.

159
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:17,920
I understand.

160
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,570
But in my opinion,

161
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,500
although someone in the Scarlet Guards

162
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,130
has the guts to collude with officials,

163
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:28,580
he wouldn't dare to collude with Beipan people.

164
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,170
Ask someone in the Ministry of Rites to come

165
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,290
to talk about the matter concerning Prince Li of Wu.

166
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,810
The lover of the imperial maid is my trusted subordinate.

167
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,810
[The residence of the Right Emissary of the Scarlet Guards, An Capital]

168
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,450
So the information should be reliable.

169
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,580
Our men colluded with Beipan people to kill Marquis Changqing?

170
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:15,970
Nonsense.

171
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:16,850
What?

172
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,720
I'm sure our men didn't do it.

173
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:22,810
I think Chen Gui's men did it.

174
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,050
Left Emissary Chen?

175
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,850
No one else can mobilize so many people.

176
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,570
And they don't have the guts.

177
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:31,710
But...

178
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,300
he secretly sent dozens of people to He County.

179
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,350
We also sent dozens of people to He County.

180
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,790
And Zhu Ji and the others died in He County.

181
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,830
How should I explain this to Deng Hui?

182
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,940
Are Beipan people also related to Ruyi?

183
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,180
Otherwise, how could they coincidentally show up

184
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,780
at the same place?

185
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,350
Then... what should we do?

186
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,030
If His Majesty blames us,

187
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,830
according to Commander Deng's style...

188
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,570
Does anyone else know the message

189
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,910
delivered by the imperial maid except you?

190
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,750
Let's go now.

191
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,480
Tell them I've left to investigate it

192
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,280
after receiving the message that Zhu Ji died.

193
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,570
As long as we survive

194
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,130
from Deng Hui's anger,

195
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,970
or they punish Chen Gui,

196
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,570
we can avoid a disaster.

197
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,190
Even if we get punished later, we won't be punished severely.

198
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,130
He can't punish

199
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,260
the Left Emissary and the Right Emissary at the same time.

200
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:25,930
Got it.

201
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,660
[The headquarters of the Scarlet Guards, An Capital]

202
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:05,670
Come and have a look.

203
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,430
My vegetables are fresh.

204
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,670
I picked them from the garden this morning.

205
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,510
Look.

206
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,530
The daikon is so nice.

207
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,480
Look.

208
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,990
The vegetables are good too.

209
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,730
I'm from the Brush Bureau. I'm on a secret mission.

210
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,850
[Brush Bureau]

211
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:35,490
Get me a uniform of the Scarlet Guards.

212
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,240
Sir, this way please.

213
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,230
[The archive of the Scarlet Guards]

214
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,470
[Roll]

215
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,230
The information on me has really been erased.

216
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,290
According to the oral edict of His Majesty,

217
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,390
Prince Li of Wu is allowed to go to Yong'an Temple immediately

218
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,150
to meet the king of Wu.

219
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,070
Now?

220
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:31,390
Yes.

221
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,590
His Majesty was busy yesterday

222
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,690
and neglected you.

223
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,230
He feels sorry.

224
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,110
That's why he issued the edict.

225
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,830
You and the king of Wu are brothers.

226
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,140
You've been apart for a few months. You can finally meet each other today.

227
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,030
You must be very happy, right?

228
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,560
Of course.

229
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,390
I'll go with you now.

230
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,900
Of course, the rules are the same as yesterday's rules.

231
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,390
The officials can only accompany you.

232
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:00,840
They can't enter the pagoda.

233
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,110
Please.

234
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,310
Please wait a moment.

235
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,690
I'm wearing a casual dress now.

236
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,290
If I'm going to see my brother, I should wear a formal dress,

237
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,830
so that I can show my respect to His Majesty.

238
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,190
Mr. Du. Mr. Ning.

239
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,390
Yes.

240
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:18,730
Help me get changed.

241
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:19,850
Okay.

242
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,070
Done.

243
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,170
Your Highness.

244
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,630
Yesterday, Miss Ruyi said

245
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,180
the king of An will compromise.

246
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,890
I thought he would just summon us today.

247
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,190
I didn't expect

248
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,770
that he asked you to meet His Majesty directly.

249
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,230
The art of war emphasizes strategies.

250
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,650
Besides, Jin Meiniang received a message long ago.

251
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,710
Those in the court of An have been suspecting your identity.

252
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,630
They suspect that you are not a member of the imperial family,

253
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,070
but a temporary substitute.

254
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:55,830
Perhaps the emperor of An wants to test you through this.

255
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,430
What should I do then?

256
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,470
My brother and I didn't meet frequently

257
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,310
or talk too much.

258
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,290
Now he is locked up in the pagoda

259
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,830
and doesn't know our plan.

260
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,440
If he can't recognize me,

261
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,270
we...

262
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:09,960
Your Highness.

263
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,190
His Majesty is a wise man.

264
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,840
Since he knows an envoy has come,

265
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,670
I think he must be prepared.

266
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:18,750
Don't panic.

267
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,440
But...

268
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,470
Your Highness,

269
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,180
this is an old item of Liudao Hall.

270
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,750
His Majesty should recognize it.

271
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,550
But it has been modified by Yuan Lu.

272
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,990
If His Majesty can't recognize you

273
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,310
or he says or does anything improper,

274
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,310
you just press here.

275
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,830
A small needle will be released.

276
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,590
Once it hits His Majesty,

277
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,000
he will be in a coma immediately.

278
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,300
You can tell them he's too excited.

279
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,720
And you can take the chance to take care of him

280
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,760
and take your time to explain everything to him.

281
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,670
Okay.

282
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,870
But I'm still worried.

283
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:57,590
If...

284
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,160
Your Highness, being worried is useless.

285
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,110
It will only make things worse.

286
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,690
You were fearless yesterday. That's why you gained the upper hand.

287
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,790
If you can stay calm today,

288
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,460
you will succeed.

289
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,150
I understand.

[The residence of the Left Emissary of the Scarlet Guards]

291
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,780
I didn't expect Li Tongguang

292
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,760
to come back safely.

293

295
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,710
we'll be in trouble.

296
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:33,590
Lord,

297
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,350
I'm Ding You, a close attendant of Zhu Ji, a Red Emissary.

298
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,080
I have something urgent to report to you.

299
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,470
Ding You?

300
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,470
It's about His Majesty summoning Commander Deng

301
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,390
to the palace today.

302
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,710
I think...

303
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:56,800
I think it's about the attack on Marquis Changqing.

304
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,290
Tell me.

305
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,850
My brother is an imperial eunuch.

306
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,210
He was on duty yesterday.

307
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,210
He told me this when he went out to buy things today.

308
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,980
After Marquis Changqing went to the palace to see His Majesty yesterday...

309
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,990
I knew something's wrong with you.

310
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,120
Your master was always with Jia Ling.

311
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,630

This is my place.

313
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,710
You are bold enough to assassinate me.

314
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,430
How dare you!

315
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,120
Really?

316
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:46,990
Unfortunately,

317
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,060
this was my place before you.

Tell me.

323
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,330
Why did you collude with Beipan people to assassinate Marquis Changqing?

324
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,420
And why did you betray the Wu Capital branch

325

326
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,590

I have no patience.

00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,320
Do you want to die in pain and itching?

331
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,050
I did attack Marquis Changqing.

332
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,820
But I really don't know.

333
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,460
And I didn't collude with Beipan people.

334

First Prince...

335
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,590
wants me... wants me to get rid of Marquis Changqing for him.

336
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,180
I dare not disobey.

337
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,250
You dare not disobey?

338
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:42,010
Have you forgotten that Scarlet Guards are the emperor's private soldiers?

339
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,430
I haven't.

340
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,490
His Majesty just treats us as his pawns.

341
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,470
Even you

342
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:52,100
ended up dead and discredited,

with nowhere to find your corpse or bones.

344
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,710
I can only align myself with First Prince.

345

Lord,

346
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,830
have you never experienced

347
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,470
the feeling of panic?

348
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,550
Lord, give me some antidotes.

349
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:05,910
Just a few.

350
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,150
Just a few.

351
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,710
I didn't want to hurt you.

352
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,430
But you're ungrateful.

353
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,210
Tell me.

354
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,880

00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,630
Your Highness, please.

374
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,640
Who's going up the pagoda?

375
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,530
His Majesty

376
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:18,020
has allowed Prince Li of Wu to visit the king of Wu.

377
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,270
Greetings, Your Majesty.

378
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,270
Who are you? Why have you disguised yourselves as me?

379
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,630
Who are you? Why have you disguised yourselves as me?

380
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:50,230
An people are really interesting.

381
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,100
Do you think

382
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,060
I can't even recognize my own brother?

383
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,710
Brother.

384
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:17,510
Ying.

385
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,230
When I heard that an envoy would come,

386
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,370
I knew it would be you.

387
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,980
This journey is dangerous.

388
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,310
My distant relatives

389
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,530
don't have the guts.

390
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:38,650
Ying, you are indeed my brother.

391
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,630
Your Majesty, these two are...

392
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,470
No need to say anything.

393
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,270
Ying and I have something to say.

394
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:46,590
You can leave now.

395
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:00,850
Ying.

396
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,550
Just now, I was worried

397
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,340
you couldn't recognize me.

398
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,020
Luckily, I have this.

399
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,580
Even without this token of Liudao Hall,

400
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,940
I could still recognize you.

401
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:36,270
You are my sister.

402
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,840
Brother, you've suffered.

403
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,280
Have you really brought 100,000 taels of gold?

404
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,220
Now we have 50,000 taels of gold.

405
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,430
The other half

406
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,140
has been converted into banknotes under Mr. Ning Yuanzhou's order

407
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,150
after we entered An Capital.

408
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,910
He's worried that An people will break their promise.

409
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,310
So we'll give the banknotes to them

410
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,270
after we leave the State of An.

411
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,000
Ning Yuanzhou is here?

412
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,510
But he's still worried that An people will break their promise.

413
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:22,510
So,

414
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,870
there are five kinds of cream.

415
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:30,150
They represent five different ways of delivering messages.

416
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,350
We'll use a kite as the signal.

417
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,830
When you apply the cream with the same color as that of the kite,

418
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,990
Liudao Hall will contact you.

419
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,980
We will do our best to save you.

420
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:43,530
Good.

421
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:45,570
Good.

422
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:47,650
Good.

423
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,110
Good.

424
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,470
You've taken into account everything

425
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,590
I thought about day and night here.

426
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,790
How is your sister-in-law?

427
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,900
She's healthy.

428
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,790
So is the baby in her belly.

429
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:17,940
I'm going to be a father.

430
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:20,620
Great!

431
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,390
Great! Great!

432
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:24,960
Then...

433
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,190
what about Danyang?

434
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:31,390
Brother Danyang has been busy with managing state affairs in Wu Capital.

435
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:32,940
Before I left,

436
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,070
he repeatedly told me

437
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,660
I must take you back to reunite with them.

438
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,010
Did he say

439
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:49,930
what kind of identity he wants me to go back with?

440
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,370
The king of Wu

441
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,530
or the king's brother?

442
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:57,850
Don't think too much.

443
00:27:58,570 --> 00:27:59,970
-Brother Danyang is diligent...
-Enough.

444
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,090
Obviously, someone

445
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,880
taught you these words.

446
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,830
Danyang and I

447
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,110
competed for the title of crown prince for so many years.

448
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,270
I know very well what kind of person he is.

449
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,590
He must have sent many trusted men and assassins

450
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,710
to stop you from arriving in the State of An successfully. Right?

451
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,070
As long as I can't go back,

452
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,270
he can take my throne

453
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,750
naturally.

454
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:20,990
-Brother.
-This is Danyang.

455
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:21,430
Brother.

456
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,100
Danyang. Danyang.

457
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,110
-Brother.
-He can't defeat me openly.

458
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:24,950
Yang Xingyuan!

459
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:35,770
Can we talk about this

460
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,530
after you return to the State of Wu safely?

461
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,360
Now even you have the guts to lecture me.

462
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,070
What did Danyang promise you

463
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:54,810
to make you an advocate for him?

464
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:56,150
I didn't have the guts.

465
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:58,910
But Brother,

466
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,590
it was your willfulness

467
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,820
that caused the death of tens of thousands of soldiers of Wu

468
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,330
in the battle at Tianmenguan, wasn't it?

469
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,630
Since we met,

470
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,230
have you ever showed your regret?

471
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,310
Have you ever asked

472
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,960
about the soldiers of Wu

473
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,260
who died and got injured for you?

474
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:25,750
Besides,

475
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,300
compared to the unrealistic throne and power,

476
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,630
isn't returning to Wu

477
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:38,030
more practical and precious?

478
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,230
I want to go back.

479
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,110
I want to go back desperately.

480
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:52,030
Your Highness, it's getting late.

481
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,710
Please wait a little longer.

482
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,060
Brother, there is one more thing.

483
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,780
Do you remember

484
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,330
Chai Ming and his companions,

485
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,800
the guards of Heaven Path of Liudao Hall who protected you?

486
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,830
There is a rumor in Wu.

487
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,270
Many people say

488
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:14,260
the guards of Heaven Path of Liudao Hall took over the army

489
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,310
and leaked military information.

490
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,160
That's why Wu was defeated at Tianmenguan.

491
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,270
Nonsense!

492
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,430
Brother, can you

493
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:22,890
write an edict now

494
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,750
to clear the names of Chai Ming and the others?

495
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,910
I want to give it to Mr. Ning later.

496
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:29,060
In this way,

497
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,750
the members of Liudao Hall in the delegation

498
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,400
can work for you wholeheartedly.

499
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,830
I'm gonna write it now.

500
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,260
I can't.

501
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,430
Why?

502
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,140
Ning Yuanzhou's demotion and banishment

503
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,440
were approved by me.

504
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,590
He must have a grudge against me.

505
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:07,850
But why did he escort you to An willingly?

506
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,870
Now I know it's for his former subordinates.

507
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:15,780
He asked you to ask me for the name clearing edict.

508
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,370
He didn't come to save me.

509
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,800
Brother, you misunderstood. It's definitely not what you think.

510
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,010
Go back and tell Ning Yuanzhou.

511
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,470
If he wants to have the name clearing edict,

512
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:25,860
he has to escort me back to Wu Capital safely.

513
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,190
Otherwise,

514
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,540
his men of Heaven Path

515
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:34,070
will be regarded as traitors forever.

516
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,950
The guards of Heaven Path were loyal to you.

517
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:36,910
How could you do this to them?

518
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,310
I have to.

519
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,750
Ning Yuanzhou is my only hope now.

520
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,540
I want to go back.

521
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:47,750
I want to go back!

522
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:03,830
Your Highness.

523
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,030
Your Highness, how is His Majesty?

524
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,420
He's fine.

525
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,360
His Majesty is also very pleased

526
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,380
to know your loyalty.

527
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,190
Your Majesty,

528
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,470
even if it will cost my life,

529
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,140
I won't let you down.

530
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,070
I'll welcome you back to Wu.

531
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:34,260
Mr. Du.

532
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,120
Let's go back to Siyi Pavilion first.

533
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,030
Okay.

534
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:55,440
Let's go.

535
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:24,550
Did you give His Majesty the mechanism box used to deliver messages?

536
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:28,710
What's wrong?

537
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,270
What's wrong? Just tell me.

538
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:38,810
Did something happen to His Majesty?

539
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,010
I asked him

540
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:48,470
to clear the names of the members of Liudao Hall.

541
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:52,390
I tried my best to persuade him. But he said

542
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,830
he doesn't believe that you would really save him.

543
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,950
He said if you want to have the name clearing edict,

544
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,980
you have to save him and get him out of An first.

545
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,060
I knew...

546
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:10,989
it's not that easy.

547
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:16,900
Sorry.

548
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:20,350
I never thought that he would become like this.

549
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,070
He didn't become like this.

550
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:23,670
He has always been like this.

551
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,870
He has always taken other people's lives as dirt

552
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:34,100
and cared much about his own gains and losses.

553
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,190
Looks like what happened at Tianmenguan

554
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:44,389
didn't help him grow up.

555
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:56,880
Let's go.

556
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,420
♫When did the cold wind start?♫

557
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,730
♫Blowing off the leaves♫

558
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:09,480
♫Wandering in the world♫

559
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:12,680
♫The bell rang at midnight♫

560
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:17,510
♫Memories came to mind♫

561
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:21,860
♫If you're destined to leave♫

562
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,690
♫It's useless to be obsessed♫

563
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,150
Your Highness,

564
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:28,990
♫I gave you everything, but it came down to nothing♫

565
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:28,830
I am glad

566
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,230
that you are not that kind of person.

567
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,370
♫The world is unpredictable♫

568
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,320
♫Love or hate, no where to hide♫

569
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,040
♫We see each other in our eyes in the sunset♫

570
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:41,800
♫But life is full of ups and downs♫

571
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:45,630
♫It's fine even if there's just one moment left♫

572
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:52,830
♫Don't get lost in the cold dream full of north wind and yellow sand♫

573
00:35:54,360 --> 00:36:01,840
♫Lost in bleakness, I have no one to comfort me♫

574
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:05,370
♫Time goes by♫

575
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:10,340
♫In this long journey, when will we meet again?♫

576
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:17,330
♫I'm lonely, wondering why we are apart after reunion♫

577
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:28,440
Let's go.

578
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:54,920
Empress Zhaojie,

579
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,190
Xin is back.

580
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:02,200
No. My name is Ruyi now.

581
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,230
I will live happily and safely

582
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,840
as you wished.

583
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:13,330
♫Don't get lost in the cold dream full of joy and sadness♫

584
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,760
You enjoyed lively atmospheres.

585
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:14,550
[Late Empress Zhaojie of An]

586
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,510
But there are only a few people guarding the tomb.

587
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:21,700
♫In the melancholy sunset glow, I look forward to seeing you again♫

588
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,100
Do you feel lonely?

589
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:18,950
Empress Zhaojie,

590
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:21,860
I miss you so much.

591
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:25,230
♫Life is too short♫

592
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:25,980
I really miss you.

593
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:30,030
♫It feels like a lifetime, and I stumble along♫

594
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:38,050
♫I hope we can reunite as soon as possible and never be apart despite the sorrow in this life♫

595
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,390
♫Time goes by♫

596
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,190
♫In this long journey, when will we meet again?♫

597
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:53,520
♫I hope we can reunite as soon as possible and be happy in the next life despite the sorrow in this life♫

598
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,030
When did you come here?

599
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:05,730
Just a while ago.

600
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,580
Aren't you worried that someone might see you?

601
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,540
You went to the Scarlet Guards and caused a scene.

602
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,580
All the secret sentinels outside Siyi Pavilion have withdrawn.

603
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:15,830
No one is here.

604
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,930
How did you know I'm here?

605
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:24,990
I thought

606
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,710
you would want to visit Empress Zhaojie

607
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,790
after finishing your business in the Scarlet Guards.

608
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,760
So I came here to wait for you.

609
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:37,230
It's a bit desolate in front of Empress Zhaojie's tomb.

610
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,030
And there are only four soldiers guarding the tomb.

611
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,870
His Majesty wrote so many poems in memory of Empress Zhaojie.

612
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:48,070
But he is careless of the matters related to her after she died.

613
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,790
The members of the imperial family are the most cold-hearted.

614
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:58,780
But...

615
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,390
you always think of Empress Zhaojie.

616
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,490
I think she would be very pleased to know this.

617
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,320
Ning Yuanzhou,

618
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:17,320
you have something on your mind, right?

619
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:21,390
Yes.

620
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,060
It's okay.

621
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,000
Let me take a walk with you.

622
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:32,540
Okay.

623
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:41,830
♫If the world is like a wave♫

624
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,080
♫Drowning the past♫

625
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:52,060
♫Who will steer the boat with me into the distance♫

626
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:56,460
♫Look through the world filled with clouds♫

627
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:59,680
♫The blade's glint hides the tears♫

628
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,690
♫Love is a lie between one's lips♫

629
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,630
Are you feeling better?

630
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:09,350
♫Searching for normality between life and death for you♫

631
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:05,250
Much better.

632
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,380
I was used to being alone in the past.

633
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,060
But now I've realized

634
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:12,650
♫I waited, but I couldn't have♫

635
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,490
I won't be so lonely if someone is by my side

636
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:16,450
♫Two people for eternity♫

637
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,250
when I'm down.

638
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:16,210
Thank you.

639
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,960
♫I waited and I got♫

640
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:26,980
♫This long journey where one shadow became two♫

641
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,460
♫At the end of the road, it's a dream♫

642
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,070
♫Even if we're not destined, it can't be forgotten♫

643
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,350
♫I thought I saw through fate♫

644
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:41,680
♫But when I wake from the dream, I'm still lost♫

645
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:42,490
Now, can you tell me

646
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:44,660
♫Who will drink with me half a lifetime's wind and frost?♫

647
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,150
what on earth happened?

648
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:48,740
♫Exchange myself for a sliver of light♫

649
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,740
♫If love does exist♫

650
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:57,040
♫Let's look back in our next life♫

651
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:52,910
Actually, soon after you left,

652
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,800
the emperor of An allowed Ying

653
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,350
to go up the pagoda to see His Majesty.

654
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,340
But His Majesty said

655
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,030
he will write the name clearing edict

656
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:03,250
only after I get him out of the pagoda.

657
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,190
I thought about it long ago,

658
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,340
but when it really happened,

659
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:18,360
I was still a little disappointed.

660
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:25,310
The members of Heaven Path died in the Tianmenguan Battle for him.

661
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,830
He just takes it for granted.
