[A Journey To Love]

3
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,900
[Episode 17]

4
00:01:58,570 --> 00:01:59,080
Please.

5
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,010
His Highness hasn't woken up.

6
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,290
If you want to pay your respects,

7
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,410
just greet him here.

8
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,510
I'm Fan Dongming from An, the vice minister of Honglu Temple.

9
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,760
Greetings, Prince Li.

10
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,130
Looking from here,

11
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,710
I can see he has the emperor of Wu's eyes.

12
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,280
I don't think he's an imposter.

13
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,870
As for if he's really in a coma,

14
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,110
I can't tell.

15
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,890
Now that you've paid your respects to His Highness,

16
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,329
you may leave.

17
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:52,810
His Highness is ill.

18
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,140
How can we leave just like this?

19
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:57,829
I'm a good physician myself.

20
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,170
Please allow me to check on His Highness.

21
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,440
How dare you!

22
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,030
His Highness is a noble prince.

23
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,920
He's not to suffer such humiliation.

24
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,520
Who are you?

25
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,820
I'm Princess Huyang of Wu.

26
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,560
Appointed Directress of Rites, I've been ordered

27
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,430
to escort my brother Prince Li to An.

28
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,230
Greet the princess.

29
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,710
Master?

30
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,920
Master.

31
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,570
I'm Jiu.

32
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:50,890
Don't you recognize me?

33
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:58,850
What is he talking about?

34
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,610
Who is Jiu?

35
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,370
His mother was also from the imperial family?

36
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,530
He and Jiu are very much alike.

37
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,410
It's me.

38
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,530
-I'm Jiu.
-Don't be rude!

39
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,860
I'm Marquis Changqing now.

40
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,209
His Majesty gave me the imperial family's surname.

41
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,089
Master.

42
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,329
I have a surname now.

43
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,860
Oh, Zhu Yin.

44
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,330
He's the attendant you chose for me back then.

45
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:26,960
Don't you remember?

46
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,600
[6 years ago, in An Capital]

47
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,730
I won, Master.

48
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,090
Well done.

49
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,330
What's my reward?

50
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:47,770
Qingyun Sword is yours now.

51
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,250
That's it?

52
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:55,850
It's from Empress Zhaojie,

53
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,590
made of heavenly meteoric iron in the previous dynasty.

54
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,610
Isn't it valuable enough?

55
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:00,530
Really?

56
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:02,250
Thank you, Master.

57
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:03,770
Stay quiet.

58
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,570
Your voice is like that of a drake.

59
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,430
It's annoying.

60
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:07,730
No way.

61
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,850
Master, there's one move I don't understand.

62
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,930
It's…

63
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:13,970
From tomorrow onwards,

64
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,690
you don't have to come again.

65
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,450
I don't have to come again?

66
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:19,770
What does that mean?

67
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,310
Since you can beat me now,

68
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,630
you just need to practice by yourself in the future.

69
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,960
Empress Zhaojie has arranged a great teacher for you.

70
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,660
You'll go study at the National University.

71
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,930
There's an attendant called Zhu Yin in the princess's mansion.

72
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:35,690
Liu Li has tested him for a year.

73
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:36,650
He's a good man.

74
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,730
Let him serve you from now on.

75
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:39,790
I'm not going.

76
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,620
I'll stay with you, Master.

77
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,810
You've made great progress in martial arts.

78
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,170
Other than martial arts,

79
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,620
I have nothing else to teach you.

80
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:50,190
You should study hard at the National University

81
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,130
to learn the art of war

82
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,890
so that you can be an official in the future.

83
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,490
I don't want to be an official!

84
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,810
I just want to be with you.

85
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,000
Investigation. Assassination.

86
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,730
I'm willing to do anything.

87
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:01,370
Nonsense!

88
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,930
You're the son of Princess Qingning.

89
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,460
Empress Zhaojie has a kind heart.

90
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,050
She'll look out for you.

91
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,250
In the future,

92
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,160
she'll give you a position in the court.

93
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,530
I don't want the empress to give me a position.

94
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,150
I…

95
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,520
I only want you.

96
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,570
Have you long decided

97
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,860
to abandon me as my mother did?

98
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,240
You want to push me away

99
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,480
with some lame excuse,

100
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:37,210
don't you?

101
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,040
Your mother didn't abandon you.

102
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,590
She's been very ill these years

103
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,830
and recuperating in a temporary palace.

104
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,409
I don't care about that.

105
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,230
All I know is both of you want to abandon me.

106
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,330
Be good.

107
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,930
No.

108
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,820
I just want to be with you.

109
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:00,650
Master.

110
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,390
Please.

111
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,310
Please don't abandon me.

112
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,370
I'm not abandoning you.

113
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,890
It's just that His Majesty has ordered me

114
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,770
to kill the military governor of Chu's Fengxiang Army.

115
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,130
I have to make sure you're in good hands

116
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,970
before I leave.

117
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,610
Do you have to go?

118
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:30,990
I'll beg His Majesty

119
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,050
to get someone else to do it.

120
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,640
Since you were born,

121
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,180
how many times have you seen him?

122
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,380
Madam, the horse is ready.

123
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,130
I should go.

124
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:44,890
Study hard.

125
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,530
If you misbehave,

126
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:47,940
I'll beat you up after I come back.

127
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,310
Master!

128
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,480
Master.

129
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,560
You're back,

130
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,160
right?

131
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,130
You're alive, right?

132
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:19,610
Back off!

133
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,070
Move aside!

134
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,370
Marquis.

135
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,330
Little Marquis.

136
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,210
Calm down.

137
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,250
Master.

138
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,330
Don't you recognize me?

139
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,130
I'm Jiu.

140
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,570
You gave me this Qingyun Sword made of heavenly meteoric iron.

141
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,730
I carry it with me every day.

142
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,679
Not a day goes by that I don't have it with me. Look!

143
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,480
I said back off!

144
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,780
I don't know you.

145
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,510
I'm not your master.

146
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,070
You've confused me with someone else.

147
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,810
You're not my master?

148
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,220
No.

149
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,530
Sorry.

150
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,770
I lost my manners.

151
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,090
It turns out He County is indeed an inauspicious place.

152
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,170
Prince Li's condition worsened here

153
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,270
and I lost my manners.

154
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,230
Please forgive me, Princess.

155
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,250
You're right.

156
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,050
You must be tired from the long journey.

157
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,570
Since you're not feeling well, Marquis,

158
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,160
please go back and get some rest.

159
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,850
After His Highness recovers,

160
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,480
you can meet him again.

161
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,690
As you wish.

162
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,320
Let's go.

163
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,880
The vice minister just now said

164
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,890
the marquis and our emperor started out enemies

165
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,100
but are very close now.

166
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,360
That's why the emperor of An

167
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,580
appointed him Commissioner for Presentations.

168
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,220
Miss Ruyi, I wonder…

169
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,210
Ruyi has said

170
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,120
she doesn't know Marquis Changqing.

171
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,490
-But Marquis Changqing…
-Mr. Du.

172
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,010
You must be tired.

173
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,330
Go back and rest.

174
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,730
Okay.

175
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,050
Get me a messenger pigeon.

176
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,450
I need to contact Meiniang.

177
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:56,810
Okay.

178
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:58,650
Let's go back to the county office.

179
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,060
Whoever leaks what just happened

180
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,260
will be executed.

181
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,060
Look into Princess Huyang immediately.

182
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:10,970
By tomorrow morning,

183
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,370
I need all her information on my table.

184
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,250
Send the fastest messenger pigeon back.

185
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,810
Tell Liu Li to come to me instantly.

186
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,130
Yes.

187
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,170
Marquis.

188
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,510
Do you still think that princess…

189
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,530
You met my master too.

190
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,730
Do you think I could possibly have been mistaken?

191
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,250
Is she my master?

192
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,630
Is she my master?

193
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,170
Answer me.

194
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,180
I-I didn't get the honor of meeting Left Emissary Ren.

195
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,050
I only

196
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,240
saw her from afar a few times.

197
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,250
So I can't be sure.

198
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,050
But in my opinion,

199
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,490
that princess is so arrogant

200
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,330
and has a Jiangnan accent,

201
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,820
so she's not likely to be Left Emissary…

202
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,780
She was definitely pretending.

203
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:52,580
But

204
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,830
Wu people's respect for her seemed genuine.

205
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,140
Marquis.

206
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,740
I know how much you care about Left Emissary Ren.

207
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,890
But it was you

208
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,170
who dug out her remains and secretly buried her.

209
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,490
The bones and scars all matched.

210
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,180
Then they must have been fake.

211
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,730
My master can do anything.

212
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,330
She used a random body to fake death.

213
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,380
It's not surprising.

214
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,510
Yes.

215
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,680
My master must be

216
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,850
on some secret mission again.

217
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,280
That's why she's pretending to be someone else.

218
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:36,730
Yes.

219
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,960
It must be so.

220
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,490
Oh no.

221
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,160
I blew her cover in front of so many people.

222
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,210
No wonder she was so angry.

223
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,490
But I'm sure she'll meet me again.

224
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,250
I'm her Jiu.

225
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:00,830
Yes.

226
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:02,700
She'll meet me again.

227
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,210
Oh yes.

228
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,700
She once told me about the signal of Scarlet Guards.

229
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,480
Sky lantern.

230
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,010
Zhu Yin.

231
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,690
Go get me a sky lantern.

232
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:22,570
Yes.

233
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,160
I'm going to meet my master.

234
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:56,850
Ruyi.

235
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,050
Come in.

236
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:08,570
Is that

237
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,260
the signal of Scarlet Guards?

238
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,130
The pattern is different.

239
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,360
It's not released by Scarlet Guards.

240
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,540
It's Li Tongguang.

241
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:17,660
Master.

242
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,610
You gave me this Qingyun Sword made of heavenly meteoric iron.

243
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:20,970
I carry it with me every day.

244
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,330
I happen to have

245
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,530
a piece of heavenly meteoric iron from the previous dynasty.

246
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,730
I gave it to you as a gift

247
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,160
to curry favor with you.

248
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,050
I'm Jiu.

249
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:30,730
Who is Jiu?

250
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,450
Speaking of which,

251
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,490
I haven't heard from Jiu for a long time.

252
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,080
I wonder how he has been these years.

253
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,340
I want to know

254
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:39,850
who Jiu is.

255
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,430
Chief Ning, you should ask Lord Ren yourself.

256
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,050
Are you really his master?

257
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:50,830
Yes.

258
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,130
He was my only disciple.

259
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,680
He was just a kid back then.

260
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,650
So many years have passed.

261
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,960
He's grown so tall.

262
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,130
I'm so surprised

263
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,290
that the crybaby back then

264
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,400
has actually become Marquis Changqing who captured your emperor alive.

265
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,490
He's really something now.

266
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,710
All my efforts to train him have paid off.

267
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,050
Will you go meet him?

268
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,860
Of course not.

269
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,810
Now, I'm

270
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,380
a princess of the State of Wu.

271
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,370
Ren Xin is dead,

272
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:30,810
so her past

273
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,400
is water under the bridge.

274
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:36,170
Good.

275
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,530
What's wrong with you?

276
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:52,930
Nothing.

277
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,260
I'm thinking

278
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,460
you were the Left Emissary of Scarlet Guards

279
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,770
and I was the Deputy Chief of Liudao Hall,

280
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,319
but we never met each other.

281
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,540
Would it have been better

282
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:09,849
if we had met earlier?

283
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,310
You're being a fool.

284
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,900
We were enemies at that time.

285
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,790
The only reason I could've met you

286
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,010
was that I wanted to kill you.

287
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:28,569
Ruyi.

288
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:32,810
Can you promise me one thing?

289
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,040
You have to tell me what it is first.

290
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,450
After Her Highness recovers,

291
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:48,770
leave the delegation as soon as possible.

292
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,650
You've been ordered to escort Prince Li to An.

293
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,250
Now that we've reached the border,

294
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,530
your mission is complete.

295
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,360
Go to Ning Residence and wait for me there.

296
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,430
I'll go back to you.

297
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,590
Okay?

298
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:01,690
Why?

299
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,290
Because of Jiu?

300
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:07,870
Sorry, Li Tongguang.

301
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,120
Are you worried that he may do something?

302
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,320
Li Tongguang is now an important official of An,

303
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,370
appointed Commissioner for Presentations to receive Her Highness.

304
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,770
Even if you don't admit you're Ren Xin,

305
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,670
he'll still be suspicious of you.

306
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,170
Once he finds out your real identity,

307
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,920
Scarlet Guards will definitely come after you.

308
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,330
That will also endanger the delegation.

309
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,610
Endanger the delegation?

310
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,010
That won't happen.

311
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,080
I'm good at disguising.

312
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,330
He met me

313
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,720
in a dim room today.

314
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,170
I just need to be more careful

315
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,530
and change my appearance a little bit.

316
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:47,370
I believe he'll think he's mistaken.

317
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:48,930
Besides,

318
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,390
I trained him for so many years.

319
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,090
I know what kind of person he is.

320
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,770
Even if he's sure that I'm Ren Xin,

321
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,440
I don't think he'll go against me.

322
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,740
But you haven't seen him in so many years.

323
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,010
You have no idea

324
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,010
what he's like now.

325
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:04,650
Ruyi.

326
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,030
Do as I say

327
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,620
as a favor to me,

328
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:09,390
will you?

329
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,410
Ning Yuanzhou.

330
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,330
What's wrong with you today?

331
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,420
Are you doubting my abilities?

332
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,610
You think I'll endanger the delegation?

333
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,610
I'm not doubting you.

334
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,410
You are.

335
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,810
Don't forget that I'm an assassin.

336
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,470
My intuition is always right.

337
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,090
Tell me. Why?

338
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,710
I'm really not doubting you.

339
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,960
I'm just worried that you and Li Tongguang…

340
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,490
Wait.

341
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,290
What's that tone?

342
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,110
I and Li Tongguang?

343
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,720
So, you're jealous.

344
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,370
I'm not jealous.

345
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,320
You denied it without thinking.

346
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:57,730
Have I touched a nerve?

347
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,170
Fine.

348
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,270
I am a bit jealous.

349
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:04,650
I don't like the way

350
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,180
that guy looked at you today.

351
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,110
I'm worried about you.

352
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,440
Why are you jealous of a naive young man?

353
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,170
His mother wasn't around when he grew up.

354
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,450
That's why he always wants to be around me.

355
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,270
He's not a naive young man,

356
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,850
nor is he a boy from an ordinary family.

357
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:21,880
He's Marquis Changqing,

358
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,070
who captured the emperor of Wu alive when he was only 22.

359
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,090
You may only see him as your disciple

360
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,090
and think it's fine.

361
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,420
But you don't know what he's thinking.

362
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:30,560
I was there today.

363
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,420
The way he looked at you

364
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,090
was the way a man looked at a woman.

365
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,190
I'm a man. I know it.

366
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,580
I know it as well.

367
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,570
I may not know

368
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,770
what it's like between an ordinary couple,

369
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,410
but I was once a White Sparrow,

370
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,490
so I know men's desires

371
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,690
as well as you do.

372
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:49,930
So…

373
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:50,520
Yes.

374
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:53,810
When Jiu was a teenager,

375
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:54,960
he might have felt something for me

376
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,360
who was older than him.

377
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,790
But it was the same for every man.

378
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,810
You were engaged to Ms. Pei.

379
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,300
I don't like that either.

380
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,170
But have I ever asked you

381
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,810
never to see her again?

382
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,520
If one day, in An Capital,

383
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,020
you run into a songstress who you once drank with,

384
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:14,090
can I tell you I'm worried

385
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,170
and that I hope

386
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,290
you leave the delegation and go back to the State of Wu immediately?

387
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,250
You can't mix these things up.

388
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:20,850
First,

389
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,650
after my engagement to Ms. Pei was broken off,

390
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,250
I never went to see her again.

391
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,330
Second, with so many things going on in the delegation,

392
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:28,890
how can I leave for a reason like that?

393
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:31,460
But Ruyi, that's not the case with you.

394
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,170
Since that day, in Jinsha Pavilion,

395
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,040
Jin Meiniang told you about the current situation of the State of An,

396
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,980
you've been very concerned about Li Tongguang.

397
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,370
And you never told me

398
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,890
that you had a disciple.

399
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:42,670
Just now,

400
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:44,740
you called him Jiu

401
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,960
again and again.

402
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,610
How can I… How can I not be worried?

403
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,250
Ning Yuanzhou.

404
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:54,800
I didn't know until now

405
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,250
that your trust in me

406
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,330
was so fragile.

407
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,650
It's not that I don't trust you.

408
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:01,290
-Let me ask you.
-I…

409
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,760
Are you asking me to leave the delegation

410
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,410
to ensure that nothing goes wrong with the mission

411
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,930
or because you're jealous?

412
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:17,940
Both.

413
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,210
Ning, hurry up.

414
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,880
Mr. Du and Qian are in the west wing…

415
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:35,630
Are you fighting?

416
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,050
Beauty.

417
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,490
Don't be angry.

418
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,740
Anger detracts from your beauty.

419
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,370
Let me, your sweet Shisan, pacify you.

420
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,530
No need.

421
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,880
You can tell me anything.

422
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,810
Pretty women like to step on men's toes.

423
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,180
Naughty girl. It hurts.

424
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:01,810
What happened?

425
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:04,490
What happened?

426
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:05,490
None of your business.

427
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,220
Having long legs doesn't mean you can be rude.

428
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,870
What have I done wrong?

429
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,800
Have you heard that? Today…

430
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:15,620
Ruyi.

431
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:16,360
Ruyi.

432
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:17,290
Ruyi.

433
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,610
I heard that Marquis Changqing lost his cool

434
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,400
at the sight of Miss Ruyi today.

435
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,460
Is he an old acquaintance of Miss Ruyi?

436
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,800
You didn't see Boss Ning's face.

437
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,000
I didn't dare to say anything.

438
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,630
I try to avoid him now.

439
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,720
My goodness.

440
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,800
Haven't you noticed that?

441
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,770
It must have something to do with Marquis Changqing.

442
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,120
I also heard that…

443
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:44,570
Ruyi.

444
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,110
I'm leaving.

445
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:52,490
You're awake?

446
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:53,850
Have you eaten something?

447
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,050
Have you recovered?

448
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,020
Yes. Yes. Yes.

449
00:23:58,650 --> 00:23:59,370
Back then,

450
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:02,250
when we were trying to find the bandits and the gold for Boss Ning,

451
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,050
I had recovered.

452
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,370
I'm like a cat.

453
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,650
I have 9 lives.

454
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,610
You were lucky.

455
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,610
If it hadn't been for your horse,

456
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,850
you wouldn't have been found.

457
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,010
I'm always lucky.

458
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,290
Ruyi.

459
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,690
Why are you in a bad mood?

460
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,180
Is it that obvious?

461
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,930
Is it because of Li Tongguang?

462
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,370
Sun Lang told me that.

463
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:35,650
He said after Li Tongguang came,

464
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,450
Boss Ning got so jealous

465
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,970
that even someone blind could feel his jealousy.

466
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:41,730
So it was true.

467
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:43,940
Ruyi.

468
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:46,250
Are you really his master?

469
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,090
Are you okay?

470
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:54,990
I'm fine.

471
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,130
I'll drop the subject if you don't want to talk about it.

472
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,490
I don't hold secrets.

473
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,110
Since you've asked,

474
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,320
I'll answer you honestly.

475
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,480
You're better than someone

476
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,230
who knows nothing

477
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,830
but thinks he knows everything.

478
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:25,980
[9 years ago, in An Capital]

479
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,950
He's Princess Qingning's only son.

480
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:29,690
Princess Qingning is seriously ill

481
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:32,730
and entrusted him to me before leaving to recuperate in a hot spring resort.

482
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:36,060
It's been 3 days since he entered the court

483
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,300
but he hasn't said a word.

484
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,850
I asked Shouji and Zhenye to play with him

485
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,330
but he ended up like that.

486
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,610
I thought about it for a long time

487
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,690
and summoned you to the court.

488
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:52,570
Your Majesty, what can I do for you?

489
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,890
Teach him for me.

490
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:56,930
Teach him?

491
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:58,290
Your Majesty,

492
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,340
I'm just a Purple Emissary in Scarlet Guards,

493
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,650
not a female preceptor in the court.

494
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,660
Forget about female preceptors.

495
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,390
He's even bitten

496
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,170
several male teachers.

497
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,250
I think he's a good kid.

498
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,170
He's just a bit weird

499
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,600
and likes martial arts.

500
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,690
That's why I thought of you.

501
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,850
You want me to teach him martial arts?

502
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:22,970
Not only that.

503
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,450
I also want you

504
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,730
to teach him to be a good man.

505
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:29,450
Xin.

506
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,450
As a Scarlet Guard,

507
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:32,890
you perhaps

508
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:35,730
have heard about that kid's story.

509
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:40,170
My position is low, so I don't know much about him.

510
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,760
I only heard

511
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,300
that his father is Princess Qingning's…

512
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,450
Paramour.

513
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,450
So he's been ashamed about that since he was little.

514
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,850
Young Master, come back!

515
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,850
At times,

516
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,350
truth is truth,

517
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,840
but it's not the kind of truth everyone thinks of.

518
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,640
Back then, Princess Qingning was married to the crown prince of the State of Su.

519
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:13,870
Later, the two countries became enemies

520
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,310
and the crown prince wanted to kill her out of spite.

521
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:17,850
A musician from Wu

522
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:20,330
who was in the good graces of the empress dowager of Su

523
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,450
risked his life to protect her.

524
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,730
Otherwise, Princess Qingning, a fragile woman,

525
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,530
couldn't have traveled so far in times of war

526
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:29,010
and come back safe.

527
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,930
But not long after she came back to An Capital,

528
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:35,690
that musician died from his injuries.

529
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,820
Princess Qingning was overwhelmed with grief.

530
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:41,570
Only then did His Majesty and I know

531
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,240
that she was carrying that musician's child.

532
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,410
What's Princess Qingning's attitude

533
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,690
to that kid?

534
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:52,290
Her feelings for that kid

535
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,550
are complicated.

536
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,970
She doesn't want him around, nor does she want him away.

537
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,130
That's why that boy

538
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:02,410
is the way he is now.

539
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:07,610
Xin.

540
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,090
That kid is very stubborn,

541
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,370
just like you.

542
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:12,720
So,

543
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,550
I hope he can grow up

544
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:17,130
into someone like you

545
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:18,650
who's strong

546
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,130
and righteous.

547
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,290
I'm flattered, Your Majesty.

548
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,100
No matter who his father is,

549
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,540
he's His Majesty's nephew,

550
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,000
my family.

551
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:35,930
Xin.

552
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,100
Teach him to be a good man for me.

553
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,340
Yes, Your Majesty.

554
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,570
May I know his name?

555
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:47,590
Jiu.

556
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,370
What's his full name?

557
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,720
Princess Qingning wouldn't tell us

558
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,140
the name of that musician.

559
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,570
So that kid has no last name.

560
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,250
He got the pet name Jiu

561
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,970
because that musician had a qin called Jiu

562
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,130
when he was alive.

563
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,290
I won't let you down.

564
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,220
Who are you?

565
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:30,930
So you can talk.

566
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,590
Get lost, or I'll kill you.

567
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,140
With a stick?

568
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:46,410
Wash your eyes if you don't want to be blind.

569
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,460
It sucks to be defenseless,

570
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,450
doesn't it?

571
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,190
Who are you?

572
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,430
I'm your master.

573
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:58,250
I don't need a master.

574
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:03,830
Say it again.

575
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,670
I don't need a master!

576
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,570
If you reject me,

577
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,300
you'll end up like that table.

578
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,560
If you accept me,

579
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,330
you can become like this sword.

580
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,450
Who are you?

581
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,720
I'm a Purple Emissary in Scarlet Guards.

582
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:37,880
My name is Ren Xin.

583
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:49,830
Again!

584
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,060
Madam.

585
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,140
Young Master ran away.

586
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:10,950
I heard that someone in An Capital was killed

587
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,230
by wild wolves the other day.

588
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,410
Split into three groups and continue the search.

589
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:15,850
Don't come back until you find him.

590
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,110
When you find him, send the Chirping Bird Signal.

591
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,000
Yes.

592
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,040
Don't cry.

593
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,670
Or I'll kill you.

594
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,840
Master.

595
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,250
Don't leave me.

596
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,490
Master.

597
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,440
You still haven't mastered Lotus Hand

598
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,430
after practicing for so long.

599
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,160
No wonder you're a paramour's son.

600
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,380
Remember this humiliation

601
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:27,940
so that you won't lose again.

602
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:29,500
Master.

603
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,620
I wish we could live like this forever.

604
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,280
Princess Qingning is seriously ill.

605
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:42,810
You're summoned to look after her.

606
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,870
Since neither of you wants me,

607
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,200
[Princess Qingning of the State of An]

608
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:54,150
I don't want you either.

609
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,150
Jiu.

610
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,610
I wouldn't see you because I didn't know how to face you.

611
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,320
Before I die, I'll beg His Majesty to take care of you.

612
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:17,350
Young Master.

613
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,280
[Mansion of Princess Qingning]

614
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,540
His Majesty has promoted you cavalry commandant.

615
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,700
If you don't meet Left Emissary Ren for the last time,

616
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,380
you will definitely…

617
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:25,970
Shut up!

618
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,650
I don't want to see her now.

619
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,120
Young Master is so insensitive.

620
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:38,360
He left without even leaving you a message.

621
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,990
You shouldn't have hurried back despite your injuries.

622
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:42,290
Forget it.

623
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,990
He left under His Majesty's order.

624
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,320
Besides,

625
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,960
he's grown up.

626
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:50,090
The end.

627
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,210
That's it.

628
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,090
So you haven't seen each other for 6 years.

629
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,650
Jiang Qiong from the Heaven Path who escaped back

630
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,810
told me that Li Tongguang is great at martial arts.

631
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:04,890
It turns out that he trained under you.

632
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:08,330
Ruyi.

633
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:10,610
Does Marquis Changqing have a thing for you?

634
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,590
I don't know and I don't care.

635
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,510
I've met countless men

636
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,580
who were interested in me.

637
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,010
Some were just curious about me.

638
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:22,469
Some admired me but also feared me.

639
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:25,159
Some wanted to use my influence.

640
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:28,170
I didn't have time to respond to every one of them.

641
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:30,489
Instead of making guesses

642
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:32,340
about my romantic relationships,

643
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:35,290
you guys should think about how to deal with Li Tongguang,

644
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,929
the difficult Commissioner for Presentations.

645
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,170
You guys?

646
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:42,590
So Boss Ning has done something that made you mad.

647
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,280
How do you know?

648
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,960
My parents were the same when I was young.

649
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,500
Every time they fought,

650
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,989
my mom would ignore my dad for days.

651
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,380
My dad was always the one at fault.

652
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,210
I'm surprised too.

653
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:58,750
On this matter,

654
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,690
he's like a completely different person.

655
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:08,170
What did you say?

656
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:11,010
Nothing.

657
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,860
Have you had your pills today?

658
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:15,030
Not yet.

659
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:24,410
Ruyi.

660
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:26,010
Is there

661
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,550
a little part of you

662
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:32,250
that likes Li Tongguang?

663
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:36,100
Whose side are you on, your Boss Ning's,

664
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,330
or Li Tongguang's?

665
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,400
I'm on Boss Ning's side, of course.

666
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:40,490
I

667
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,020
don't like naive young men.

668
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,140
Alright. Story time is over.

669
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:49,370
Sleep tight.

670
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,770
I'll go to check on Her Highness.

671
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:56,810
She doesn't like naive young men.

672
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,720
So Li Tongguang doesn't stand a chance.

673
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:43,850
♫The east wind is the cruelest♫

674

♫I end up alone again♫

679
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,460
Could it be that she didn't see it?

♫If fate is on my side♫

681
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,380

♫I don't know how many miles I have to go to find you♫

687

00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:19,900
Oh no.

689
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,470
Master was once hunted by Scarlet Guards.

690

♫I search for your eyes but can only see your back♫

691
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,650
I shouldn't have used their Phoenix Lantern as the signal.

692
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:27,650
If the Scarlet Guards in He County had seen it,

693
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:28,960
she'd be in danger.

No.

697
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,320
I messed it up.

698
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,440

702
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,600

she kept telling you to always stay calm.

718

You're a marquis now.

719
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,160

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,270
[5 years ago, in An Capital]

745
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:21,560
My master would never have harmed the empress!

746
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:28,770
♫I want to hold on to you but it's too late♫

747
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:24,640
Master!

748
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,360
[Outside the imperial prison, in An Capital]

749
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:26,450
Master!

750
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,110
Master!

751
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:29,650
Calm down, Young Master.

752
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:37,230
♫It's too late, so I have to cling to these memories♫

753
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:30,810
Let go of me!

754
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,240
I need to save my master!

755
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,150
-Young Master.
-Master!

756
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:34,800
-Master!
-Young Master!

757
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,320
Master!

758
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:45,720
♫Forgetting you is a fool's errand♫

759
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:43,290
Master!

760
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:54,110
♫Forgetting you is a fool's errand♫

761
00:39:58,890 --> 00:39:59,770
In my heart,

762
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:02,170
you're the most beautiful girl in the world.

763
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,450
I also wish

764
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:06,170
I could always be by your side.

765
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:09,930
Am I dreaming?

766
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,770
Is it really you, Qingyun?

767
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,560
Ying.

768
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,920
How can you leave just like this?

769
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,890
How can you let me die without doing anything?

770
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:23,210
Have you forgotten

771
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:24,480
the promises we made?

772
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,080
Remember.

773
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:29,290
I've touched every place of your body.

774
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,440
You're my woman!

775
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:32,440
Even if you go back with them,

776
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,820
they'll look down on you all the same.

777
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,840
You killed Yuan Lu.

778
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,820
You jeopardized the whole delegation.

779
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:42,040
You lied to me.

780
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,260
Sorry.

781
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,610
You can't kill yourself that way.

782
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,070
Now you can kill yourself.

783
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,280
Do you need my help?

784
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:03,230
But if you want to hang yourself,

785
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:05,860
it'll take 15 minutes for you to die.

786
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:08,130
During that time,

787
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,930
your heart and lungs will burn like hell.

788
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,560
Your body will struggle

789
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,510
like a stranded fish.

790
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:17,500
In the end,

791
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:19,910
you'll die

792
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:22,500
with your tongue hanging out.

793
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:28,140
Are you sure you want to die such a horrible death?

794
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:41,730
Ruyi.

795
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:47,590
I don't want to live anymore.

796
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,390
It was for Zheng Qingyun

797
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:54,470
that I decided to pretend to be Prince Li.

798
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:56,730
But he actually

799
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:00,930
colluded with Brother Danyang to lie to me

800
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:02,920
and kill me.

801
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:06,150
What's the point

802
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,690
of me keeping living?

803
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,060
There's no one else here.

804
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:17,210
I'm not Ning Yuanzhou.

805
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:20,010
I won't give you

806
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:22,190
all that patriotic crap.

807
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:24,970
Your life is yours.

808
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:27,120
If you want to die,

809
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:28,930
go ahead.

810
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:31,000
I won't stop you.

811
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,850
But before you die,

812
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:45,910
you have to know 3 things.

813
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:48,250
First,

814
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,920
we've retrieved all the gold.

815
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:53,370
Second,

816
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:56,790
your Brother Danyang didn't want to kill you.

817
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,020
He just wanted to prevent you from going to the State of An.

818
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:02,100
Third,

819
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:06,050
the State of An sent the Commissioner for Presentations to receive you.

820
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:09,110
He's Marquis Changqing, Li Tongguang,

821
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,970
who captured your brother.

822
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:12,860
Today, he wanted to see you

823
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:14,530
to try you out.

824
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,190
It was hard for us to make him leave.

825
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,850
By the way,

826
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:21,760
Yuan Lu finally woke up.

827
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,820
Shouldn't you apologize to him

828
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:27,590
before you die?

829
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:30,130
After all,

830
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,800
he almost met his maker

831
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,170
thanks to your lover.

832
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:00,820
Who's it?
