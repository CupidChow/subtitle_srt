00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,890
Half of them died on the battlefield

194
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,720
and half were captured with His Majesty.

195
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,610
If you go to the State of An,

196
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,530
you can save them all together.

197
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,190
In that case,

198
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:14,650
I'm not interested.

199
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,790
I'm no longer their boss.

200
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:19,890
I asked about their fate

201
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,840
for the sake of us formerly being sworn brothers.

202
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,460
Please go back and tell Prime Minister Zhang

203
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:26,930
that I won't go

204
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,790
to the State of An.

205
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,110
Ning Yuanzhou,

206
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,660
don’t take my kindness for granted.

207
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,060
Mr. Zhao, why are you angry?

208
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,440
Do you remember

209
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,390
the 9th rule, 10th rule,

210
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:58,120
and 13th rule of the Liudao Hall?

211
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,070
The 9th rule of Liudao Hall:

212
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,920
those who collude with outsiders

213
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,600
and harm the Hall's people

214
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,010
must die.

215
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,150
The 10th rule:

216
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,710
Those who frame the Hall's people

217
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:28,750
must die.

218
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,810
The 13th rule:

219
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,880
Those who disrespect superiors

220
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:37,710
must die.

221
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,690
The Ning ancestors

222
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,810
and my godfather, Old Chief Song,

223
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,060
are enshrined here.

224
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,740
He asked me in his will to carry the coffin into the ground,

225
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,680
but I was sent to the army.

226
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,310
That's why it's been delayed.

227
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,960
The Old Chief's spirit will shine forever.

228
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,920
The Old Chief's spirit will shine forever.

229
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,820
The memorial tablet that Zhao Ji knocked over

230
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,050
is also his.

231
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,450
His tablet represents himself.

232
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,880
Zhao Ji disrespected the Old Chief.

233
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,900
Did he violate the 13th rule

234
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,180
and should be executed?

235
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,960
I sacrificed my life

236
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,000
and worked tirelessly for 20 years,

237
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,590
but Zhao Ji schemed with a corrupt official

238
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,040
and framed me multiple times,

239
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,620
even wanting me to die at the Tianmenguan Battle.

240
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,250
Did he violate the 10th rule

241
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,410
and should be executed?

242
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:09,980
Yes!

243
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,780
Zhao Ji took office only half a year ago

244
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,020
and already destroyed everything

245
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,000
that the Old Chief and I

246
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,610
shed blood and sweat to create.

247
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,720
He neglected the Messenger Pigeon Unit,

248
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,370
abolished the Palace of Hell,

249
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:25,750
and fabricated crimes

250
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,790
to imprison those who refuse to submit,

251
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,290
causing the army to have no secret information to use

252
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,440
and die on the battlefield.

253
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,790
Of the 16 Heaven Path brothers with Chai Ming,

254
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,580
half were imprisoned in humiliation

255
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,510
and half died in a bloody battle.

256
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,890
Did he violate the 9th rule

257
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,310
and should be executed?

258
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,030
Yes!

259
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,860
Now, I punished this man for three crimes

260
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,450
according to the Rules of Liudao Hall.

261
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,350
Any objections?

262
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,640
Lord, you are wise.

263
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:12,900
Brothers,

264
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,230
I'm no longer your lord.

265
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:20,790
I'm just a resentful ghost who's tired of the court.

266
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,720
If you still care about our sworn brotherhood,

267
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,020
pretend you never saw me tonight.

268
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,090
After I

269
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,690
bury my godfather tomorrow,

270
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,430
I will be able to leave the capital

271
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,320
and retire.

272
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:36,900
Boss Ning, don't go.

273
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:39,010
You will always be our boss.

274
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,540
We don't want you to leave.

275
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:42,800
Liudao Hall changed drastically

276
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,880
after you left.

277
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,270
Please come back

278
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,730
and continue to be our chief.

279
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:48,530
Brothers,

280
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,960
all good things must come to an end.

281
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,860
Besides, my body is injured.

282
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,740
I can't hold on anymore.

283
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,110
Now,

284
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,360
I just want to find a relaxing place

285
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,430
and live for a few more years.

286
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,110
Please

287
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,350
do me a favor.

288
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,750
The Wu Capital Branch of the Scarlet Guard has been destroyed.

289
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,730
Mr. Zhao went out to chase after the survivors.

290
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,230
It's unknown when he will come back.

291
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,720
It's take least three or four days.

292
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,930
It's getting late

293
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,930
and the Scarlet Guard's spy didn't get caught either.

294
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,310
Brothers, retreat!

295
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,340
Boss Ning, take care.

296
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:41,330
Take care.

297
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:00,850
What's wrong?

298
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,580
Why didn't you tell me you faked you rdeath?

299
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,090
I thought you were actually dead.

300
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,960
I'm sorry.

301
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:18,500
I won't do it again.

302
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,590
You know it.

303
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,820
Since Zhang Song started supporting Zhao Ji,

304
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,910
I didn't want to do this anymore.

305
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:29,230
If I didn't fake my death this time

306
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,630
and lied to you too,

307
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,510
he'd never let me retire into the secluded woods.

308
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,230
I don't care.

309
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:37,610
I've been your follower since I was a kid.

310
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,970
I'll follow you wherever you go.

311
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,140
Even if you die,

312
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,950
I have to look after your grave too.

313
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:46,310
Okay.

314
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,510
I promise you.

315
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:49,190
Deal?

316
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:49,900
Deal.

317
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:55,810
Close the door.

318
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,410
I'll bury

319
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,540
the Old Chief tomorrow morning.

320
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,500
By the way,

321
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,400
the princess asked me

322
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,370
last time she saw me.

323
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,870
She asked when you're coming back.

324
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:07,990
Should I tell her?

325
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,790
Later.

326
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:10,950
Close the door first.

327
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,030
Okay.

328
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,610
Boss, the door is closed.

329
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,060
This...

330
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,670
You're the one Lou Qingqiang wanted to catch, right?

331
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,500
The Scarlet Guard spy?

332
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:47,810
No.

333
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:48,950
I'm not.

334
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:50,630
Please spare my life.

335
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,170
You're not from the Scarlet Guard?

336
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,640
Then why do you know

337
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,880
the 18 Falls of the Scarlet Guard?

338
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:10,230
I...

339
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,930
I really don't know anything

340
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,000
about the Scarlet Guard, Blue Guard, or whatever.

341
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,470
I'm just a dancer of the Imperial Music Department.

342
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,490
My sisters went to perform at the Shiyi Mansion that day,

343
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,100
but none of them came back.

344
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,570
The officials of Liudao Hall insisted

345
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,670
that the song they sang was to curse His Majesty

346
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,050
and killed them all.

347
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,210
Last night,

348
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,010
they came to the Imperial Music Department to arrest people.

349
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,230
They said Ling Long is a spy

350
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,570
and I am also a suspect.

351
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,480
I didn't want to die.

352
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,010
I gave up my innocence

353
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,790
and was ravaged by the guards

354
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,440
in order to escape.

355
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,370
Boss,

356
00:26:58,670 --> 00:26:59,610
I know about this.

357
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,640
Zhao Ji framed them

358
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,320
in order to get money from them.

359
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,630
Luckily, that bastard Zhao Ji is dead now.

360
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,310
Don’t cry.

361
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:08,960
Don't worry. It's okay now.

362
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,610
Help her up.

363
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:19,840
Miss.

364
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,790
Please spare my life.

365
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:34,910
Don't be afraid, Miss.

366
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,550
Master Ning just wanted to test you.

367
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,740
He didn’t intend to kill you.

368
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,210
Boss,

369
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:41,010
she can't even dodge your attack.

370
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,670
How can she be from the Scarlet Guard?

371
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:44,800
Try it if you don't believe me.

372
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,170
She doesn't even have internal force.

373
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,090
Really.

374
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,760
Her energy center truly is empty.

375
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,220
She fainted from fright.

376
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,780
[Wu Capital, Mansion of Prince Danyang]

377
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:28,400
Greetings, Your Highness. I am Jiang Qiong, commandant of Liudao Hall's Heaven Path.

378
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,480
Thank you for sending a trusted aide to take me back to the capital.

[Jiang Qiong, cavalry of Liudao Hall's Heaven Path]

380
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,380
No need to thank me.

381
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,670
I am your old master.

382
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,130
I just want to know

383
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:42,970
how His Majesty is.

384
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:44,910
His Majesty is safe.

385
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,450
I saw him with my own eyes.

386
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,030
With your own eyes?

387
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,670
I was incompetent

388
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,270
and was captured with His Majesty

389
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,280
by the State of An's Marquis Changqing.

Chai Ming.

392
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:03,640
Chai Ming.

393
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,890
Call your men from the Liudao Hall to protect His Majesty

394
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:06,910
and take me out.

[Chai Ming, cavalry of Liudao Hall's Heaven Path]

396
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,000
Okay.

397
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,710
Be careful, Your Majesty.

398
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:30,810
Chai.

399
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:51,870
Greetings, Emperor of Wu. I am Li Tongguang, the Marquis Changqing of An.

400
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:52,340
[Li Tongguang, Marquis Changqing of the State of An]

401

Rise.

402
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:02,960
Are you eating or not?

403
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,690
Who do you think you are?

404
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,840
[The next day, An army barracks]

405
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,800
I will not eat,

406
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:06,790
even if I starve to death.

407
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:07,530
Are you eating or not?

408
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,500
Your Majesty.

409
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,010
Jiang Qiong?

410
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:19,970
How is it?

411
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,950
I said the emperor of Wu State is safe, right?

412
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,650
Since you've met him,

413
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:28,670
please send a message to Prime Minister Zhang

414
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:29,800
or the Empress for me.

415
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,210
Say that the State of An has no intention to keep your emperor here for long.

416
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,130
We only want 100,000 taels of gold

417
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,300
and we will release him immediately.

418
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,100
Really?

419
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:43,510
Of course.

420
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,610
Since I could catch you,

421
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:49,450
I can also let you go.

422
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,470
I hope you can keep your word

423
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:52,910
and treat His Majesty well.

424
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,670
His Majesty is the emperor of a country.

425
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,510
If he is deliberately humiliated,

426
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,320
the thousands of Wu warriors

427
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,300
will fight for revenge with their lives.

428
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,860
Since you are so bold,

429
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,230
I'll give you one more condition.

430
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,090
The emperor's envoy you send

431
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,610
must be a prince.

432
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,290
100,000 taels of gold

433
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,740
and a prince.

434
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,190
He's targeting me.

435
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,790
I also know that the An bandits are up to no good.

436
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,920
We lost the Tianmenguan Battle, but we still have strength.

437
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,420
If we hand over the 100,000 taels of gold,

438
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,610
our national strength will be greatly damaged.

439
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,090
Besides that,

440
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,310
they could take the money

441
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,900
and still keep His Majesty and me in custody.

442
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,590
This way, the palace would be without a leader.

443
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,490
Only the Empress's child could ascend the throne.

444
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:50,970
By then,

445
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,340
the state would be poor and have a young ruler.

446
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,940
The day of defeat would be imminent.

447
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,350
Tomorrow,

448
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,400
tell the officials the truth.

449
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,810
I have my own judgment.

450
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:01,450
Yes.

451
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:04,270
Your Highness,

452
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,560
I have another request.

453
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,270
Go ahead.

454
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:13,860
On the way back to the capital,

455
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,610
I heard many rumors.

456
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,750
Everyone said that His Majesty was captured

457
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,620
because the Heaven Path's guards betrayed the state.

458
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,770
I can guarantee with my life

459
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,390
that no matter if we're alive or dead,

460
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,510
the people of the Heaven Path are forever brave.

461
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,930
We will never betray our state.

462
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:30,960
Your Highness, please clear our name

463
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,060
in the court tomorrow.

464
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,060
How can I clear your name?

465
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,690
The Tianmenguan Battle

466
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,170
was thousands of miles away.

467
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,740
Besides you,

468
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,490
the rest of the survivors were captured and sent to the An Capital.

469
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:45,880
How can I clear your name

470
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,840
with just my words?

471
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,570
Could it be...

472
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:54,250
Could it be that my brothers died in vain?

473
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:07,310
Wake up.

474
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,860
I've changed the medicine for you.

475
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,370
You're fine now.

476
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,230
Pack up

477
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,160
and leave.

478
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,410
You helped me change the medicine.

479
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:26,740
Does that mean you saw my body?

480
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:34,910
You're a White Sparrow.

481
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,150
Stop acting like you're a prude.

482
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:41,480
Your acting is bad.

483
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,990
This person is scheming.

484
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,520
Looks like I need to show some flaws

485
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,040
to get his trust.

486
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,140
Sir, wait.

487
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,310
Please wait.

488
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:06,240
I don't mean to cling to you.

489
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,790
Please don't chase me away.

490
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,139
There are villains outside.

491
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,949
As a weak woman,

492
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,860
I'm afraid I won't be able to live for a moment longer

493
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,560
if I step out of this yard.

494
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:18,830
What does it have to do with me?

495
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,790
Kindness is a virtue.

496
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,340
You are a kind man.

497
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,770
I believe you learned last night

498
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:28,940
that I used to be a part of Liudao Hall.

499
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:30,909
How can I be kind?

500
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,370
You didn't chase me away last night.

501
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,710
You are a kind person.

502
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,870
Please do another act of kindness

503
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:41,920
and don't chase me away.

504
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,110
I'm willing to do

505
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,040
whatever you want me to do.

506
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:13,990
You have no internal force,

507
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:16,370
but you could escape from the people of Liudao Hall.

508
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,230
I believe those dancers from the Imperial Music Department

509
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,610
taught you a lot.

510
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,030
You're a White Sparrow, right?

511
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:25,850
No.

512
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,680
She didn't teach me anything

513
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,340
except dancing.

514
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,710
I'm definitely not a White Sparrow from the Scarlet Guard.

515
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,910
Please believe me.

516
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:39,960
I really want to trust you,

517
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,190
but you know

518
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,710
that White Sparrows belongs to the Scarlet Guard.

519
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,080
How can I trust you?

520
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:52,930
The door is over there.

521
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:54,790
Go by yourself.

522
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,740
I'm not leaving.

523
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:04,870
You're not leaving?

524
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:17,790
Are you leaving or not?

525
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,400
I won't leave,

526
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,280
even if you kill me.

527
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:32,850
The interrogator said

528
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,160
Ling Long is the Scarlet Guard's White Sparrow.

529
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,960
Is it a sin that I have a good memory?

530
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:42,230
Ling Long wanted to recruit me before,

531
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,600
but I just pretended I didn't understand.

532
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,290
I don't want to

533
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,140
be a seductive White Sparrow

534
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,120
unless I have no other choice.

535
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,440
You started speaking informally

536
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,880
so quickly.

537
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:02,670
What's the point?

538
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,950
You have never been trained before,

539
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,900
but you could survive in my hands for so long.

540
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,700
With this alone,

541
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:11,800
you can still survive well,

542
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,670
even if you leave.

543
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,060
Who says I've never been trained?

544
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:27,110
The people of the Imperial Music Department beat me with a wet whip.

545
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:31,650
Your Liudao Hall tormented me with torture devices.

546
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,360
All of that was more painful than now,

547
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,430
but no matter how painful it is,

548
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:39,960
I can endure it,

549
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:43,180
because I want to live.

550
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,590
I don't want to die.

551
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,420
Boss, what are you doing?

552
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,070
Master Ning was so cruel.

553
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,750
It’s all my fault.

554
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,710
I shouldn't have talked back to him.

555
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:27,850
I really don't want

556
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,230
to be taken away by those people again.

557
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:33,200
See if these can help.

558
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,330
I'll make the medicine now.

559
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,350
Thank you, sir.

560
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:38,500
My name is Yuan Lu.

561
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,220
Don't worry about Boss Ning.

562
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:41,290
I’ll talk to him for you.

563
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,320
You really want her to stay?

564
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:03,240
Although she looks a little pitiful,

565
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,620
she is still a stranger.

566
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,660
If you think something is wrong with her,

567
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,820
I'll kick her out now.

568
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:11,090
Anyway, no matter the time,

569
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,760
I’ll only listen to your orders.

570
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,210
Good for you.

571
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:18,470
You've improved.

572
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:21,780
However, I want to ask you.

573
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,650
The people of Liudao Hall are used to death.

574
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,550
Why are you so kind to her?

575
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,890
I was a palace slave too. You know that.

576
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,860
Before my sister died,

577
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,900
she was also a dancer in the Imperial Music Department.

578
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:38,680
So,

579
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,100
how about

580
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,780
we let her stay?

581
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:49,130
If you really think there's something wrong with her,

582
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,470
I...

583
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,730
I'll kill her with one move.

584
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:56,160
Fine.

585
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:57,990
I'll listen to you this time.

586
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,770
Thank you, Boss.

587
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:02,880
Go and make the medicine.

588
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:34,890
Stop pretending.

589
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,850
You didn't even shed a tear.

590
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,030
As a White Sparrow, you really...

591
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:46,280
You don't have to argue with me anymore.

592
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,200
I don't want to hear it either.

593
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:48,610
But

594
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:51,150
you can stay.

595
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:56,930
Thank you.

596
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:00,080
I will repay you in the next life.

597
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,010
Forget the next life.

598
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,310
Let's do it now.

599
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,500
You look energetic.

600
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,230
You can start working

601
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:19,090
after taking the medicine.

602
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,080
There are a lot of firewood for you to chop.

603
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:24,790
Then cook some food.

604
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,020
We're going out in a bit.

605
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,900
We need to eat something warm when we come back,

606
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,270
understand?

607
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:31,740
Yes, sir.

608
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:46,460
Boss.

609
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:55,920
Thank you, Yuan.

610
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:57,390
Hurry and drink it.

611
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:18,150
I don't think the State of An harbors evil intentions.

612
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,120
The State of An also suffered great losses

613
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,740
from the Tianmenguan Battle.

614
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:24,430
It's understandable that they'll hold hostages

615
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:26,430
for the ransom.

616
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,410
What if they take the money and don't let them go?

617
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,820
His Majesty being captured isn't enough.

618
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:34,000
Now, we also need to add in Prince Danyang.

619
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:37,050
The emperor of An has been ambitious since the beginning

620
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:38,490
and wanted to occupy the gold mine of Wu State,

621
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,230
but you say it's understandable.

622
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,100
What are your intentions?

623
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:44,700
When did I say

624
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,470
to let Prince Danyang go to the State of An?

625
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:49,290
Isn't Prince Ying a prince too?

626
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,200
Stop arguing.

627
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,710
If I'm unwilling to be the envoy to bring His Majesty back,

628
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:59,810
I won't be able to escape criticism from the people.

629
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,000
If I'm the envoy,

630
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,420
the Wu State will also be in danger of collapse.

631
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:09,710
Officials,

632
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:13,180
if you have two cups of poisonous wine before you right now,

633
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:14,790
one being white arsenic

634
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:16,290
and the other red arsenic,

635
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,400
which one would you choose?

636
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,690
But the question is

637
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,110
why do we have to choose one?

638
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:32,530
That's right.

639
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:34,920
The An people must have a headache now too

640
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,240
over how to deal with His Majesty.

641
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:37,970
Even if we don't pay the ransom,

642
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,890
they won't dare to kill His Majesty.

643
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:42,690
We can buy some time

644
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:45,050
so that they won't be able to seize the opportunity.

645
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,400
Nonsense!

646
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:48,550
His Majesty is in trouble,

647
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:51,870
but you are not worried at all.

648
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,750
Are you still qualified to be an official?

649
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:10,180
[Princess Yang Ying]

650
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,520
Your Highness,

651
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,340
you are a noble elite.

652
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,340
How can you pretend to be a lowly eunuch

653
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:20,970
to listen to the court?

654
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,850
I'm just worried about my brother.

655
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:29,060
Besides,

656
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,000
other than you and Yuanzhou,

657
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,400
no one else views me as a legitimate princess.

658
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:35,320
[Imperial Guard Zheng Qingyun]

659
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:35,070
I'm not much nobler

660
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:37,370
than a eunuch.

661
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:39,710
Your Highness, don't insult yourself.

662
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,320
Even if your birth mother has a lowly status,

663
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,360
you are still the child of the late emperor.

664
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:49,860
But

665
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,830
Xingyang never treated me

666
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:54,510
as our father's daughter

667
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:56,030
when she called me a lowly bitch.

668
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:03,440
Since Your Highness is ten times prettier than her,

669
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:05,190
you should allow her

670
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:07,830
to be ten times pettier than her.

671
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:11,270
Do you really think so?

672
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,390
In my heart,

673
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:15,980
you are the most beautiful woman in the world.

674
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:20,410
Then...

675
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:25,720
Then why don't you want to marry me?

676
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:35,830
The princess's husband always comes from a noble family.

677
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:39,720
I'm just a guard with nothing.

678
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,020
I won't be able to marry you

679
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:44,930
unless I make an achievement in battle.

680
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:47,210
This time,

681
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:49,110
I wanted to fight,

682
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:50,950
but I didn't get the permission.

683
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:52,270
It's good that you didn't go.

684
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:54,290
When Yuanzhou went,

685
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:55,930
I almost went blind from crying.

686
00:45:57,610 --> 00:45:59,370
So many people died at the Tianmenguan Battle.

687
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:02,770
What should I do if he's one of them?

688
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:06,290
I...

689
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:11,330
Don't worry, Your Highness.

690
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:12,700
Have you forgotten?

691
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:13,970
Mr. Ning

692
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:16,510
is not just the only son of your preceptor, Ms. Gu.

693
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,360
He's also the most outstanding Deputy Chief

694
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:19,790
of the Liudao Hall for the past 30 years.

695
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,360
With his skills,

696
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:23,170
he'll definitely be okay.

697
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:25,970
Really? Promise me.

698
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:27,580
I promise.

699
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:30,960
No.

700
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:33,030
You're lying.

701
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,180
You just said

702
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:36,320
the princess's husband must be from a noble family,

703
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,420
but Xingyang's husband

704
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,960
is just a civilian who tested third in the imperial examination.

705
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:46,630
Princess Xingyang is the daughter of the late empress.

706
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:48,190
She can choose her husband

707
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,140
because she has 800 fiefs.

708
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:57,530
I wish I could have 800 fiefs.

709
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:00,800
The empress has just become pregnant

710
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:02,910
and is worried about His Majesty.

711
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:04,930
Aren't you close to her?

712
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,760
If you visit her often,

713
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:09,300
maybe you'll have the chance to have a fief

714
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:11,200
after His Majesty returns.

715
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:30,390
[Prince Ying, Yang Xingyan]

716
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:42,040
Brother,

717
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:45,150
I'm willing to be the emperor's envoy.

718
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:46,690
Get up first.

719
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:48,300
Brother,

720
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:50,840
if you don’t allow me to be the emperor's envoy,

721
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,940
I will stay kneeling.

722
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:11,030
Sister-in-law, don't worry.

723
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:12,890
Since the State of An proposed the condition,

724
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:14,630
His Majesty will definitely be able to return.

725
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:17,380
The Wu State has 100,000 taels of gold.

726
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,010
It’s not about the amount of gold.

727
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:22,400
Then...

728
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:24,350
Your Highness.

729
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:25,650
Princess Ying.

730
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,560
Prince Ying suddenly went to the meeting

731
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:32,130
and volunteered to be the emperor's envoy.

732
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:33,580
No.

733
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,870
Father told me before he left

734
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:37,750
to take good care of you.

735
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:40,750
Now, it's hard for you to even walk into this hall by yourself.

736
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:42,610
How can you travel so far?

737
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:44,010
Brother,

738
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,580
I beg you.

739
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,360
Please let me go.

740
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:52,060
Prince Danyang, please give the order.

741
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:55,500
Prince Danyang, please give the order.

742
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:01,840
Sister-in-law.

743
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:05,310
Slow down.

744
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:07,430
Be careful.

745
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:10,210
I can't let Prince Ying go.

746
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:11,840
Prince Ying's leg

747
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:13,660
was crippled to save me.

748
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,240
I promised to protect his safety.

749
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:18,680
But what can you do

750
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:20,030
even if you go to court?

751
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,940
Prince Danyang is ambitious and can't bear to give up the throne.

752
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:24,810
Of course he doesn't want to go to the State of An.

753
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:30,690
Although all of the royal uncles have passed away,

754
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:33,200
they still have a few sons.

755
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:36,590
At worst,

756
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:39,270
I'll choose one of them to be adopted by the late emperor.

757
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,610
Then, who will dare not to acknowledge him as a prince?

758
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,770
But how can we explain it to the State of An?

759
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,430
I'm afraid those princes

760
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:49,830
won't be willing to risk their lives as the emperory's envoy either.

761
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,000
I can

762
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:57,030
give him 3,000 fiefs.

763
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:00,930
The greedy ones will be tempted.

764
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,400
Three thousand fiefs?
