[Episode 12]

4
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,430
Prince Li was frightened.

5
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,590
He looked pale.

6
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,360
But he was relaxed when talking to General Shentu.

[Scarlet Guard, Red Emissary
Qiong Zhu]

8
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,870
He was also very reasoned when he spoke about the political situation of the two states.

9
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,950
It seems that this Prince Li of the State of Wu

10
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,510
is not as rumored,

11
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,390
that he was just a a useless royal that was raised within palace

12
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,829
and knows nothing about state affairs.

13
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,570
I just saw

14
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,850
someone from the delegation sent a body to the crematorium.

15
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:40,370
After verifying with Jiang Xiu from Jumen Branch,

16
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,370
the dead is Hupo

17
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,890
from the State of Wu's deletaion.

18
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,270
She's dead?

19
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:47,870
Did you see it clearly?

20
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,050
They said

21
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,050
she was killed by the bandits who attacked last night.

22
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,450
We finally got a nail

23
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,790
that we had hammered in deeply,

24
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,730
but it's broken just like that.

25
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,440
Shentu Chi insisted that

26
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,970
he didn't arrange for those bandits.

27
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,410
Then who did?

28
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,050
No.

29
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,350
The appearance of the bandits and Hupo's death

30
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,480
are too coincidental.

31
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,210
Could it be

32
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,970
it was Chu's police officer who was trying to provoke from within?

33
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,390
Or...

34
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,710
The Wu delegation found out about her true identity

35
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,110
and killed her.

36
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,090
And they're putting on another show for us.

37
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,340
If that's the case,

38
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,410
Prince Li is one who thinks a lot.

39
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,930
Write these into a summary

40
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,810
and it them to Lord Jia Ling with a letter pigeon.

41
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,410
Yes.

42
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,360
You must keep an eye on Prince Li.

43
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:38,890
Pay attention to his every move.

44
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,970
Yes.

45
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,050
Madam.

46
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,450
General Shentu invited Prince Li to visit the barracks.

47
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,290
Looks like Shentu Chi wants to test

48
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,770
how bold Prince Li can be.

49
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,450
In the mighty An,

00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,330
with great soldiers,

51
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,769
wins every battle

52
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,550
and succeeds in every attack.

53
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,190
They are my personal soldiers.

54
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,510
Your Highness.

55
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,930
What do you think?

56
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,770
Not bad indeed.

57
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,450
But

58
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,180
I'm afraid you said something wrong.

59
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,770
These people

60
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,580
are the state's soldiers,

61
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,450
and not your personal soldiers, right?

62
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,330
Your Highness is eloquent.

63
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,130
You're flattering me, General.

64
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,130
I have a few more battle horses.

65
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,930
Would Your Highness like to watch them with me?

66
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,710
Bring the horse!

67
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,660
Yes!

68
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,010
Very well.

69
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,950
I've long heard that the soldiers in Shadong Tribe

70
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,930
are good at raising horses.

71
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,690
Seeing it for myself today,

72
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,590
you deserve your reputation.

73
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,060
May I have the honor

74
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,840
to invite you to join me in horse riding?

75
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,570
As you wish.

76
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,720
Your Highness.

77
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,409
Please.

78
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,010
Please.

79
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,710
Let me take Your Highness

80
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,530
around Xucheng properly today.

81
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,920
Protect His Highness and follow them closely.

82
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:55,770
Understood.

83
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,380
Go.

84
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,159
Go away!

85
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,550
This is too fast. Something is wrong.

86
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,520
Protect His Highness!

87
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,390
Move aside!

88
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,020
Move!

89
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,560
Get out of the way!

90
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,090
Move!

91
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,870
Make way!

92
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,900
-G-General Shentu.
-Move!

93
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,650
Be careful!

94
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,409
Your Highness, why are you so slow?

95
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,210
You're like a woman.

96
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,590
Hurry!

97
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,690
Move aside!

98
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,710
Qian, we can't keep chasing like this.

99
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,060
Go take a shortcut.

100
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:33,409
Okay.

101
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:34,070
The rest of you, follow me.

102
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,590
Yes!

103
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,250
Move!

104
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,430
Move!

105
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,330
Move!

106
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,230
Vegetables! Fresh vegetables!

107
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:35,860
Are you okay?

108
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,860
I'm sorry.

109
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,100
Your Highness.

110
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,909
Isn't the State of An's Xucheng more prosperous than befor

111
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,070
under my command?

112
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:48,750
Prosperous?

113
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,530
The land that used to belong to the State of Wu that your king had occupied

114
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,510
is known for it's heavy taxes.

115
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,110
The people have to work harder

116
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,190
in order to be able to eat their meals.

117
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,130
General Shentu,

118
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,790
why are you so proud of this?

119
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,890
I'm really sorry.

120
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,290
This is my compensation.

121
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,470
I don't want your money.

122
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,410
If it weren't for your Yang Family's incompetence

123
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,310
and loss to the State of An,

124
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,080
we wouldn't have to take on such heavy taxes.

125
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,290
Does everyone know?

126
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,080
He! He is the brother of that stupid emperor.

127
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,450
The money he carries belongs to the Emperor of Wu!

128
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,170
It's all our hard-earned money.

129

-Return our hard-earned money!

Return our hard-earned money!

136
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,130

Get out of the way!

Move!

142
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,710
What's going on?

143
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,570
What happened?

144
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,360
Commandant Qian

145
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,190
Return the money! Return the money!

146
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:15,970
Help!

147
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:17,520
Return our money!

148
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,460
Pay us back!

149
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,310
Lord.

150
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:20,770
Pay up!

151
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:21,610
-Stop!
-Wait a little longer.

152
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,750
Let him suffer more.

153
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,290
Who told him to be so sharp-tongued?

154
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,410
Pay me back!

155
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,350
Help!

156
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:30,530
Bad person!

157
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,800
All the people from Wu's Palace are bad people.

158
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,170
I'll beat you.

159
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,070
I...

160
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:36,980
I'll kill you.

161
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:46,730
Are you hurt?

162
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:48,760
Ru...

163
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,230
General.

164
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,330
How dare you!

165
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,760
How dare you!

166
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,490
How dare you instigate the people to attack Wu's Prince Li?

167
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,390
Why are you guys not taking him account?

168
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,190
General Shentu,

169
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,900
do you think these people

170
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,830
are bewitched by the evil

171
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,630
so

172
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,870
when Prince Li was attacked,

173
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,600
they just stood by and looked?

174
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,550
Who are you?

175
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,890
Why haven't I seen you in the delegation today?

176
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,920
There are Scarlet Guards in the State of An.

177
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,650
There is the Liudao Hall in the State of Wu.

178
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,020
Do you think

179
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,130
as the envoy of the country,

180
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,530
Prince Li wouldn't have secret bodyguards?

181
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,620
Move!

182
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,590
Move!

183
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,530
Although they don't run fast enough,

184
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,480
when it's dark and windy,

185
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,570
it's not a problem for them to kill

186
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,690
one or two people who intend to sabotage

187
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,130
peace talks between the two states.

188
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,450
Liudao Hall deserves its reputation.

189
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,930
Your Highness.

190
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,870
I'm injured.

191
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,400
Please forgive that I can't send you back.

192
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:11,790
Let's go.

193
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:25,610
Ruyi.

194
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,760
I knew you wouldn't leave me alone.

195
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,620
How did you protect her?

196
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,820
How could you put Her Highness in danger?

197
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,130
Don’t blame them.

198
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,560
I was the one who made a mistake.

199
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:44,650
Oh right,

200
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,830
don't bother the people either.

201
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,770
They used to live and work in peace,

202
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,490
but unfortunately became victims to heavy taxes.

203
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,370
-Of course they'd.../N-Your Highness.

204
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,830
I don’t blame the people.

205
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,870
But Qian Zhao's poor protection

206
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,480
is a serious negligence.

207
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,190
Mr. Ning,

208
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,440
you must give an explanation for this.

209
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,050
Don't worry.

210
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:13,790
Yuan Lu.

211
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,690
Have you gotten rid the people sent by Shentu Chi?

212
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,110
We are the only ones in the yard now.

213
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,570
Qian Zhao and Yu Shisan

214
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,560
failed to guard properly.

215
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,070
You are banned from eating and drinking for two days.

216
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:38,740
Yes.

217
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:40,890
Those below Sun Lang

218
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,470
will be sentenced to the same penalty.

219
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,080
Yes.

220
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,340
Mr. Ning,

221
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:47,870
how can we convince the public

222
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,630
with such a light sentence?

223
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,410
The responsibility of incompetent soldiers is on the general.

224
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,250
All this happened

225
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,970
because I didn't lead give right commands from the back

226
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,340
and didn’t predict the enemy’s situation in advance.

227
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,270
So I, Ning Yuanzhou,

228
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,010
will be punished ten strokes of cane.

229
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:03,430
This...

230
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,370
-Boss.
-Boss.

231
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,390
No, Ning Yuanzhou!

232
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,140
I order you!

233
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,590
He is the head guard.

234
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,900
Don't interfere with his decision.

235
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,800
Bring the whip.

236
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,980
Boss.

237
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,680
Speak up.

238
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,250
Let the An people outside hear you.

239
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,440
Sun Lang, execute!

240
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:42,490
I...

241
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,970
Yuan Lu. You do it.

242
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,500
Boss.

243
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,820
Don't you listen to me anymore.

244
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,810
Everyone is at fault.

245
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:56,900
We should all be punished to strokes.

246
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,630
Yes, that's right.

247
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,610
I'm the Chief.

248
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,510
This is an order.

249
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,090
Yuan Lu.

250
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,530
If you can't do it,

251
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:08,770
I'll do it.

252
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,480
Who are you to do that?

253
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,210
I was the one who saved Her Highness today.

254
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,030
A benevolent man can't lead the army.

255
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,460
You don't even understand this.

256
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,280
No wonder you can't protect the people.

257
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,220
Do you think he wants to be beaten?

258
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:36,290
No.

259
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,350
He just wants to set an example

260
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,910
so that you can be more vigilant.

261
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,550
Now that you're in the State of An's territory,

262
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,690
you can't be as relaxed as

263
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,790
when you can be

264
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,270
when you pass the Tianxing Gorge.

265
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,190
From now on, enemies

266
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,160
and traps are everywhere.

267
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,330
If you make any mistake,

268
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,880
you will be doomed.

269
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:55,910
That's right.

270
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,400
That's what I want to say.

271
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,050
Beat me!

272
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,650
He took these strokes for you.

273
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,320
Do you remember it?

274
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,660
♫The wind rises, and fate changes♫

275
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,520

♫The night is cold, the way of the world is long♫

281

♫For things to return to normalcy♫

308
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,180
-Boss Ning!
-Yuanzhou.

309
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,320
-Boss!
-Boss!

310
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,090
Yuanzhou!

311
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,340
-Ning.
-Boss.

312
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,600
Boss Ning just coughed blood.

313
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,540
He didn't want me to tell you because he didn't want you to worry.

314
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,250
Last night, not only his internal force was greatly damaged,

315
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,840
his lungs was also injured.

316
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,890
So it's the new injuries on top of the old injuries,

317
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,350
and a sudden gush of blood.

318
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:29,960
It won't threaten his life.

319
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,010
I'll go get some medicine.

320
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,110
Wait.

321
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,710
Why don't you go in and see him?

322
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,270
I'm a Scarlet Guard.

323
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,690
He's from Liudao Hall.

324
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,000
He was knocked out by me just now.

325
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:01,980
Why should I visit him?

326
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,510
I won't apologize for what happened yesterday.

327
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,410
But you saved Her Highness.

328
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,240
So,

329
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,210
be it you want to kill or stab me,

330
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:18,670
it's up to you.

331
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm too lazy to do anything to you.

332
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,220
Me too.

333
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,440
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have scolded you like that.

334
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:28,730
Boss Ning is right.

335
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,210
How old were you when my father passed away?

336
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,610
I shouldn't have imposed my resentment on Scarlet Guards

337
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,650
on you.

338
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:40,070
I never let you down.

339
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,360
But I was a scumbag yesterday.

340
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,210
Just like Qian,

341
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,430
I owe you my life.

342
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,410
I can give it to you

343
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,650
anytime.

344
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,100
I don't care.

345
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,190
Forget it.

346
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,340
Go concoct the medication and you go take care of him.

347
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,270
But...

348
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,450
You two don't understand women.

349
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,150
She won't forgive us so easily.

350
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,570
But since she's back,

351
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,310
she won't leave.

352
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,230
Why do you say that?

353
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,030
First, her identity was exposed.

354
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,530
Second, she knows we hate her.

355
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,950
Third, she was so badly injured

356
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,650
but she still came back.

357
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,250
Who do you think it's for?

358
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,660
It must be Ning.

359
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:23,740
He is so cool

360
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,570
even when taking off his clothes.

361
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,350
You're awake.

362
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,750
Why does this scene

363
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,910
seem so familiar?

364
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,450
Fortunately,

365
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,590
I wasn't drugged with sleeping pills this time.

366
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,690
There are some in here.

367
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,510
It looks sweet.

368
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,160
Why did you come back?

369
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:55,430
Because of you.

370
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,720
Because I don't believe your promise.

371
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,230
People from you Liudao Hall

372
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,130
lied to me,

373
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,270
and tried to kill me.

374
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:08,470
You're too cunning.

375
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,060
Finding the murderer of Her Majesty

376
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,510
is my lifelong wish.

377
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,640
You want to send me away with just a few lines?

378
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,400
No way.

379
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,520
Our transaction

380
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,740
is not over yet.

381
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:30,480
You're right.

382
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,150
This is an important matter.

383
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,510
You must keep an eye on me every day.

384
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,060
Sit.

385
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,440
From now on,

386
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,690
I'll try not to contact Scarlet Guards

387
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,710
and not bring any danger to the delegation.

388
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:13,680
Okay.

389
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,110
I haven’t figured out how to deal with Qian Zhao.

390
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,720
Don’t try to make me

391
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,190
get close to them anymore.

392
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,680
What kind of partner are you?

393
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:28,970
Okay.

394
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,200
Why do you agree to everything?

395
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:34,830
If I tell you

396
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,340
I want to have a baby with you, you'll agree too?

397
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,330
Okay.

398
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,550
I mean

399
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:58,060
our body is suffering from fatigue and injuries.

400
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,150
Plus, I'm poisoned.

401
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,010
If now...

402
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,180
If it's now...

403
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,720
it may not be good for the child.

404
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,170
How about this?

405
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,470
After everything is over,

406
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,480
we can talk about it again/

407
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,600
Are you trying to trick me to slow down again.

408
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,450
It's not about quantity.

409
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:31,720
As long as it works.

410
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,350
Did I hit you too hard

411
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,100
you become muddleheaded?

412
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:46,410
Your stroke was extraordinary.

413
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,490
I knew it when you hit me

414
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,370
with the first stroke.

415
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,550
On the surface, it looks bloody,

416
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,420
but it only hurts the skin

417
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,030
and not the organs.

418
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,370
If it weren't for the fact that

419
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,160
you have a nice face,

420
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:06,600
I would've

421
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,230
whipped you to death.

422
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,040
Okay.

423
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,880
Again?

424
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,810
No, I mean...

425
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,480
What you said

426
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,230
was very well said.

427
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,530
It's very accurate.

428
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,380
It's exactly what I'm thinking.

429
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:30,410
Of course.

430
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,590
After all,

431
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:35,430
I've been the Left Emissary who commands thousands and is only below one.

432
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,840
Of course I know

433
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,340
what you would think and do.

434
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:44,490
So...

435
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:48,700
You know me.

436
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,320
You meant what you said just now?

437
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,530
After everything is over,

438
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,190
Are you really willing?

439
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:15,780
♫My palm line branched because of you♫

440
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,000
I do.

441
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,190
You have to prove it to me.

442
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:22,680
♫My hands hurt when spring comes♫

443
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,150
How can I prove it?

444
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:28,670
♫I don't know how to put it♫

445
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:33,110
♫The first turn around♫

446
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,730
♫I expect to see you there♫

447
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,500
♫I've had too much to drink♫

448
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:45,730
♫But I can't drink away my woes♫

449
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,250
Your heart is beating so fast.

450
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,360
You must be lying to me again.

451
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:52,820
♫I'm hopelessly in love♫

452
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,620
Look at you.

453
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,210
How many tricks like this do you have?

454
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:56,900
♫Drunk, I saw your eyes; dreaming, I had you in my arms♫

455
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,610
A lot.

456
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,010
Didn't you say

457
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,650
♫Waking up sober, I only miss you more♫

458
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,510
as a White Sparrow, I didn't master my skills yet?

459
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,050
I will take my time

460
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:03,480
♫You're God's gift to me♫

461
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,050
and slowly

462
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:08,340
♫Your smile breaks up the dark like the light of dawn♫

463
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,550
strike you

464
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,240
with a trick after another.

465
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,160
♫You light up my world like a shooting star♫

466
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,090
Okay.

467
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,010
♫You came a long way and still have a long way to go♫

468
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,920
♫No one knows your name♫

469
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:23,630
♫An indispensable part of my life♫

470
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:29,420
♫My one and only♫

471
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:56,570
Your Majesty.

472
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,050
Yuan Lu.

473
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,880
-Morning.
-Morning.

474
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,280
Your Highness, you can't go in.

475
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:00,900
Why not?

476
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,140
Boss Ning is still in a coma.

477
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,850
You can't go in. It's inconvenient.

478
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,430
It's okay. I'll just take a look.

479
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,120
Otherwise, I will be really worried.

480
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:11,990
You didn't let me guard by him last night.

481
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,420
Your Highness.

482
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:13,970
What's wrong?

483
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:14,510
Listen to me.

484
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,320
Go ahead.

485
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,580
You go back first.

486
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,590
I'll get you when Boss Ning wakes up.

487
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:20,890
Don't worry.

488
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,520
I'll just take a look.

489
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,090
Don't you trust me?

490
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,050
I said I'll call you.

491
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,210
I will definitely call you.

492
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:27,130
I just want to take a look.

493
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:28,590
He's awake.

494
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,340
Your Highness, you can't go in even if he woke up.

495
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,690
Why?

496
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,260
Because...

497
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:34,730
Because...

498
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:37,190
Qian is giving Boss Ning acupuncture.

499
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,140
Acupuncture can’t be exposed to wind.

500
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:40,790
Boss Ning was woken up by the acupuncture.

501
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,350
He's woken up by the acupuncture?

502
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:44,740
That's right.

503
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,820
But, when I came here,

504
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,870
Qian was concocting the medication out there.

505
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,350
Shisan just swapped shifts with Qian.

506
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:57,400
He needs to take off all his clothes for acupuncture.

507
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,620
Okay, I'll go to the front yard first.

508
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:02,460
I'll come back later.

509
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:04,770
No, wait.

510
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,490
I went to see Ruyi just now.

511
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,510
She's not in either.

512
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,730
You lied to me.

513
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,760
It's not Qian in the room

514
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,920
but Ruyi–

515
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,770
Everyone is pretending not to know.

516
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:30,400
Yuanzhou and Ruyi really...

517
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,680
Yes.

518
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,430
That's great.

519
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:34,870
I knew something was wrong.

520
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,660
I've always thought they should be

521
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,780
a couple just like

522
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,580
what's written in novels.

523
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:40,280
Yes, that's right.

524
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:40,820
Your Highness.

525
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:41,870
Are you alright?

526
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:43,820
I'm fine.

527
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:45,630
Just now,

528
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:47,430
we saw a little rabbit here.

529
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,510
It's fluffy.

530
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,560
So cute.

531
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:50,850
It just hops like this.

532
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:51,930
There's a rabbit here?

533
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:52,430
Where? Where?

534
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,470
Take me there.

535
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,140
Over there.

536
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,080
-Really?
-Over there.

537
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:56,410
-Over there.
-Let's go.

538
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,890
Go. Go and have a look.

539
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,120
What's wrong?

540
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,930
I felt much better yesterday.

541
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,120
Suddenly, there's a mixed aura in my energy center.

542
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,300
Your internal force is not stable today.

543
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,590
Let me dress up.

544
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,750
I'll handle it for you later.

545
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:24,210
Why not now?

546
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,930
Shisan and the others will come look for me later.

547
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,670
If they see you here,

548
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,040
they would misunderstand that last night we–

549
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,710
Misunderstand?

550
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,110
Everyone knows about us.

551
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,460
They used to walk around naked

552
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,830
in front of me.

553
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,440
Ying doesn't know.

554
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,510
Ying is still young.

555
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,430
She doesn't know these.

556
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,950
Why doesn't she?

557
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,210
Don't you know that she and Zheng Qingyun...

558
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,010
Ning Yuanzhou.

559
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,260
Are you shy?

560
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,990
I'm not.

561
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:02,880
I just...

562
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,560
Don't act like I'm trying to kidnap a civilian man.

563
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:08,110
You just don't want it to be awkward in front of them.

564
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,940
Don't worry.

565
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,460
Since we made a deal last night,

566
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,280
go and save your Emperor of Wu.

567
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,590
Before that,

568
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:32,310
I won't touch you at all.

569
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:34,280
Killers

570
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:36,270
are all very patient.

571
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,400
Ning.

572
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,010
Are you done?

573
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:51,980
Qian is coming to deliver the medicine.

574
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:53,440
Mr. Du is coming

575
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,650
to ask about your arrangement today too.

576
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,120
Yuan Lu asked me to inform you.

577
00:32:58,490 --> 00:32:59,060
Ning.

578
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,410
Ning!

579
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:03,830
She left?

580
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,030
If she left, she left.

581
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:08,880
Why did you kick me?

582
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,170
Are you angry?

583
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,240
You have such a short temper.

584
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,930
Since the storm has subsided,

585
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,320
let's bid farewell to Shentu Chi

586
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,730
and go to the State of An immediately.

587
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:22,390
However,

588
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,270
from now on,

589
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,830
for Your Highness's safety,

590
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:28,670
the delegation and the caravan will merge.

591
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:33,610
Then Her Highness will be safe.

592
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,850
What about the rescue of His Majesty?

593
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,360
The reason we established the caravan

594
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,470
is to make the operation easier.

595
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:42,140
But yesterday,

596
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,400
someone said something

597
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:44,810
that reminded me.

598
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,090
Since it's a Prince's trip,

599
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,330
the people of Liudao Hall will definitely follow him.

600
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,550
Otherwise, the An people will be suspicious.

601
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,460
So my previous decision

602
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,180
was indeed blinded.

603
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:07,950
Think about it.

604
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,980
What would you think if you were An people?

605
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:13,530
How would you guess the delegation's action?

606
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:15,130
First,

607
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:16,620
when the Prince goes out,

608
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:19,150
the people of Liudao Hall will definitely be involved.

609
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,540
Second,

610
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,639
I believe the An people can also think that

611
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,290
when we arrive in An Capital,

612
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:26,710
we will try our best to save His Majesty.

613
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,360
In that case,

614
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:29,989
why don't we

615
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,690
just tell them that

616
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,840
there are many of us

617
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,710
but we're all incompetent.

618
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,090
In this way, they can lower their guard.

619
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,969
I think it makes sense.

620
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,510
After all, it’s a secret order that Boss Ning

621
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,110
is commanding Liudao Hall.

622
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:43,250
An people don't know that.

623
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:45,239
There is no one left in Wu Capital Branch's

624
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,120
Scarlet Guards.

625
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,040
So they might not be able to find out our background.

626
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:50,500
Everyone,

627
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,070
look at our luxurious lineup.

628
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,050
The new Prince Li.

629
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:57,080
Mr. Du who came back after resting.

630
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:59,980
Boss Ning who was exiled to the army after committing a huge crime.

631
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:01,830
I, who was taken out of prison.

632
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,430
Little boy, Yuan Lu.

633
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:06,420
And look at these two.

634
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,850
One is reckless and the other is an idiot.

635
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,460
You're the idiot.

636
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,340
Smile.

637
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,080
Does one even have to assume?

638
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,450
Your incompetence is written on your face.

639
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,270
Full of unusual people.

640
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,780
Don’t be rude to me and Mr. Du.

641
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,360
That’s it then.

642
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:26,930
Let them see

643
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,290
how unusual people like us

644
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,070
can cause huge troubles

645
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:32,180
when we arrive in An Capital.

646
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:38,910
Ruyi, look.

647
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,800
Everyone is happy that you're back.

648
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,650
Boss Ning and I are the happiest.

649
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,140
Thank you

650
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:48,320
for just now.

651
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:51,990
I'm happy too.

652
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,300
That's good.

653
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:38,440
Stop!

654
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:40,870
A noble is on the sedan.

655
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,160
Please do not follow.

656
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:42,740
Move!

657
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,770
It seems to be Prince Li's car.

658
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:59,790
Ruyi, I want to ask you something.

659
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:00,640
Yes.

660
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,330
Miss Ruyi.

661
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,890
I heard that your internal force is unstable.

662
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,930
Do you need me to check it for you?

663
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,610
Of course.

664
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,010
Of course Ruyi's injury needs to be recovered soon.

665
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:16,490
Otherwise, what will she do when she return to the State of An.

666
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,240
I want to ride a horse anyway.

667
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,800
Imperial Guard Ning, switch horses with me.

668
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:22,180
Okay.

669
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:24,760
Stop!

670
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:30,550
Yuan Lu!

671
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,090
Shisan.

672
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,350
Qian.

673
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,670
Why is Shisan acting weird today?

674
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:44,160
Why is he winking at me?

675
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,530
Maybe it's because you're holding a female rabbit.

676
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:48,880
You old bastard!

677
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:50,050
Let's stay away from him.

678
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,550
Are you crazy?

679
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:55,590
Here.

680
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,490
Why are you laughing?

681
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,230
No, be serious.

682
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,010
Okay.

683
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,190
Water's coming.

684
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,410
Here's the water.

685
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,470
Have a seat.

686
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,590
Come on. I want to serve some too.

687
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:31,420
Here.

688
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:33,760
Okay.

689
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:35,700
Don't drink.

690
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,000
There's something wrong with the water.

691
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:50,250
Everyone, stop drinking!

692
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:52,010
There are dead rats in the water!

693
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,260
Don't drink it!

694
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:08,510
I'll kill you!

695
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:10,570
Who is it?

696
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:11,460
Ding Hui.

697
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:13,510
Stop chasing him. He's a kid.

698
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:14,930
He's still wearing a funeral clothing too.

699
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:18,710
Are you okay?

700
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:22,190
Why are they doing this to me?

701
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,170
They poisoned me with well water.

702
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:25,590
And hit me with stones.

703
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,900
Just because I'm Prince Li,

704
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,190
I'm born a sinner?

705
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,730
They are not targeting you.

706
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:31,670
They are targeting your brother.

707
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:34,720
But my brother didn't mean it.

708
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,510
Winning or losing is common in war.

709
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:39,130
He's suffering in the State of An now too.

710
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:40,510
Your Highness.

711
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,350
How old do you think

712
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,410
that kid just now is?

713
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,120
About 14 or 15 years old.

714
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,150
Your Highness.

715
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:49,080
According to our rules,

716
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,160
men who are eighteen years old are adult.

717
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:53,430
In order to recruit more troops,

718
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,710
His Majesty ordered for men who are over 16 years old

719
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,920
at the five cities at the border

720
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:57,820
to join the army.

721
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,620
He was wearing hemp clothing.

722
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,510
He's probably mourning for his father.

723
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:04,190
During the Tianmenguan Battle,

724
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:06,600
thousands of people died in Xucheng.

725
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,160
He and those people yesterday

726
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,250
are worried that once His Majesty returns,

727
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,030
they will send huge amounts of troops.

728
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,910
That's why they are attacking you.

729
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:15,870
But...

730
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,070
Isn't it the people's duty

731
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,620
for the men to join the army and women to sew?

732
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,280
Live and work in peace until you grow old.

733
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,410
That's the duty of the people.

734
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,490
When His Majesty was alive,

735
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,230
the people of Xucheng

736
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,690
didn't get any special benefits.

737
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,390
Now that the State of Wu is defeated,

738
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:36,190
they are even more disappointed.

739
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:39,020
Water can carry a boat and can also overturn a boat.

740
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,860
Before you want others to be loyal to you,

741
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,300
you have to think about

742
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,670
what you have done for them.

743
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:49,560
W-Will you still go to the State of An with me then?

744
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:51,850
My brother put you in jail.

745
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,730
And I acted recklessly before.

746
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:56,630
Did I hurt

747
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:57,690
everyone too?

748
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:59,550
I didn't do anything

749
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:00,350

You even bought us roasted lamb.

to attack on the way I was taking.

798

After careful deliberation,

I think there must be something wrong.

I'm afraid it will ruin your reputation

I won't marry him no matter what.

843
