[My Journey To Love]

3
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,850
[Episode 39]

4
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:01,690
Your Majesty.

5
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,480
Thank you for earlier.

6
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,010
You're welcome.

7
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,360
Even if you're not the Empress,

8
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,770
and just an ordinary pregnant woman,

9
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,290
I would still help you.

10
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,810
I have a question.

11
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,450
How did you and Ning Yuanzhou

12
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,710
guess Prince Ying's plot?

13
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,930
I came from Scarlet Guards.

14
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,410
He comes from Liudao Hall.

15
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,450
We have the same principle

16
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,810
when it comes to judging things.

17
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,050
If something is too confusing,

18
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,010
the person who would gain at the end of it

19
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,170
will be the mastermind.

20
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,460
When we arrived in the State of Wu,

21
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,520
We heard that Prince Danyang...

22
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,050
No, the new emperor,

23
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,450
was injured in the ancestral temple.

24
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,220
We happened to have experienced a conspiracy

25
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,730
at a temple in An.

26
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,970
I knew something was fishy.

27
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,090
You're an expert.

28
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,480
No wonder you are so good at dealing with Prince Ying.

29
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,050
Aren't you afraid?

30
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,370
Although I've never

31
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,650
left Wu Capital in my life,

32
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,550
when I was young,

33
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,050
I dreamed of becoming a heroine.

34
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,550
Looking at how decisive you were with killing him just now,

35
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,650
I can only envy you.

36
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:18,810
After all,

37
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,210
no matter how much power I had

38
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,840
or how much authority I'm about to have,

39
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,570
it's all because

40
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,170
I'm someone's wife

41
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,790
or someone's mother.

42
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,260
But you are different.

43
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,900
As Ning Yuanzhou said,

44
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,030
the light that glows from you

45
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,390
doesn't need to rely on him.

46
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,400
Thank you for your praise.

47
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,200
No wonder Ying always said

48
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,930
her sister-in-law treats her the best.

49
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,200
You refuse to accept His Majesty's reward.

50
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,810
But would you

51
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,410
be my friend?

52
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,760
This is the symbol of the Empress of Wu.

53
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,450
Take it.

54
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,070
When you go in and out

55
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,770
of the army with Ning Yuanzhou,

56
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,610
it may bring you less troubles.

57
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,330
Although you are rich,

58
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,730
when a woman gives birth,

59
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,730
it is like passing the gate of death.

60
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:30,650
So,

61
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,100
I want to give you this incense

62
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,930
to wish you a smooth delivery.

63
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:40,990
Thank you.

64
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,470
This is the best gift.

65
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:52,850
The Ning Yuanzhou is here.

66
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,240
He looks like

67
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,050
he's afraid that I would do something to you.

68
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,130
Take care.

69
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:09,320
See you.

70
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,920
When did you get so close to Her Majesty?

71
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,500
You were smiling and greeting each other.

72
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,860
She told me many things

73
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,540
about you and Ms. Pei.

74
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,690
She also asked me how we got together.

75
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,090
Wh-What did she tell you?

76
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,290
No, I mean...

77
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,280
What did you tell her?

78
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,690
I said I wanted a child.

79
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,100
So I drugged you.

80
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,930
Why do you say everything?

81
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,210
You're pulling my leg again.

82
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,690
It's not that you can't say that.

83
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,250
But you have to tell the truth.

84
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,330
You didn't drug me.

85
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,580
It was Ying who did.

86
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,700
Are you sure

87
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,370
Her Majesty will be more relieved if she knows this truth?

88
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:19,980
You're right.

89
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,909
How is it? Is everything ready?

90
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:49,810
When you entered the palace,

91
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,150
everyone was already getting ready.

92
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,360
We will go fight at Beipan

93
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:53,780
as long as you give the command.

94
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,159
Okay.

95
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,530
Tell our men to wait outside the city.

96
00:06:58,610 --> 00:06:59,570
Let's set out immediately.

97
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:00,700
Yes.

98
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:09,620
I was going to

99
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,730
take you back to Ning Residence.

100
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,550
It's okay.

101
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,560
After all,

102
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,450
I saw your ancestors

103
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,650
and your godfather last time.

104
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,330
Yes, you're right.

105
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,090
We'll come back together after the war.

106
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,500
And I'm experienced

107
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,680
in war.

108
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,590
We will definitely come back safely.

109
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,010
What experience do you have?

110
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,240
I have experience as a military chef.

111
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,550
I...

112
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,130
Think you're funny?

113
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,970
I-I-I've always been funny.

114
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,620
No, I'm telling the truth.

115
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:35,690
Yes.

116
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,830
At the end of Layue of the sixth year of Wu's Yongyou,

117
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,370
Duke Qing of An was trapped in He County

118
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:43,590
and failed to break through.

119
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,720
[Beipan
New Left Worthy Prince]

120
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,430
The former Left Emissary of the Scarlet Guards, Ren Ruyi,

121
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,670
along with Wu's Marquis Jingyuan, Ning Yuanzhou,

122
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,110
led 2,000 vanguard of the Wu army to assist He County.

123
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:54,770
Master...

124
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,120
Reinforcements are here! Hang in there!

125
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,230
There are more reinforcements over there.

126
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,750
On the same day, the new Leader of Shaxi, Chu Yue

127
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,470
led 1,000 Shaxi soldiers of An to reinforce.

128
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,670
After Left Worthy Prince failed to attack the city,

129
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,790
[Beipan
Beipan's King]

130
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,910
Beipan's King led the army,

131
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,090
saying he would take down He County at all costs.

132
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:26,930
Prepare the shields!

133
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,050
On the first day of the first lunar month, of the seventh year of Wu Yongyou,

134
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,470
Deng Hui led 1,500 Scarlet Guards

135
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,340
to the battlefield.

136
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,120
Under the command of Duke Qing, Li Tongguang,

137
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,640
the two armies of An and Wu joined forces to fight against Beipan.

138
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,320
Attack!

139
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,750
These days,

140
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,400
we’ve been fighting Beipan outside the city

141
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,470
for no less than four to five times.

142
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,370
Although we luckily managed to win again today,

143
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,050
Beipan only retreated to only ten miles away.

144
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:18,810
According to their habit,

145
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,450
they will launch another attack in two days.

146
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,050
Don't worry.

147
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,020
Two days later, even if the Beipan people come back again refreshed,

148
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,050
by then,

149
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,570
His Majesty would have arrived with the troop.

150
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,170
They have 20,000

151
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,410
strong people.

152
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,250
Not only can they protect He County,

153
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,850
they can also chase the Beipan people away from Tianmenguan.

154
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,240
That’s right.

155
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,920
And I brought another 2,000 people here.

156
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,190
Ying.

157
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,130
Ruyi.

158
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,460
Didn't I tell you to stay in An Capital?

159
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,400
What are you doing here?

160
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,730
Where did you bring 2,000 people from?

161
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,140
Only you're allowed to fight?

162
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,330
Am I only allowed to stay in the mansion?

163
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,040
If we can't defend He County,

164
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,770
after Beipan passes through Yuzhou,

165
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,490
An Capital won't be safe.

166
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,610
I don't want to become someone who caused

167
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,970
the country to perish as soon as I married you.

168
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,760
Instead of staying in the Duke's Mansion and doing nothing,

169
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,660
I might as well gather the Yulin Army stationed in An Capital

170
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,390
to escort the army provisions and weapons gathered by the people

171
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:17,730
and come here to help.

172
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,610
Why?

173
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,650
You lost battles one after another because you're incapable.

174
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,020
How dare you lecture me now?

175
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,030
Yang Ying...

176
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,830
I'm here.

177
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,540
Can you shout louder?

178
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,400
Save him some face.

179
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,330
Did you see that?

180
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,370
There are several fat sheep

181
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,650
in this batch of supplies.

182
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,300
We can finally have

183
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,750
a bowl of pipping hot lamb soup.

184
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,390
Yes.

185
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,410
We have to thank the Duke's wife for being considerate to us.

186
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:53,690
I heard

187
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,610
the Duke’s wife is Marquis Ning’s sister

188
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,850
and Madam Ning's disciple.

189
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,280
These two people are the best.

190
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,820
With their help guarding the city,

191
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,530
we'll be able to survive until the reinforcements arrive.

192
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:03,650
That's right.

193
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,330
We won the battle today.

194
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:10,990
The Duke's wife

195
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,510
brought us a lot of food supplies too.

196
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,250
Enjoy yourselves, everyone.

197
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,140
-Okay!
-Okay!

198
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,330
After we defeat the Beipan people,

199
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,300
I’ll treat you to clear lamb soup!

200
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,410
-Okay!
-Okay!

201
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,250
-Eat.
-Okay!

202
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,650
With military supplies and provisions in the city,

203
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,730
the military morale is indeed much more stable.

204
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,400
Let's go.

205
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:42,180
[He County]

206
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,290
You weren't telling

207
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,050
the truth just now, right?

208
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,690
When will His Majesty's

209
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,090
reinforcements arrive?

210
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,110
Don't lie to me.

211
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,330
I can't hide anything from you.

212
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,610
It's inevitable that 20,000 marching soldiers are slow.

213
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,370
On their way,

214
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,090
they were met with ambush by Chu people too.

215
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,330
The State of Chu?

216
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,650
But don't worry too much.

217
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,640
I just received news that

218
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,530
Chu's patrol cavalry has retreated.

219
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,700
Now His Majesty

220
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,490
should be arriving at Xucheng soon.

221
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,050
Thank you

222
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,370
for stabilizing Jiu's morale.

223
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,650
I just happened to help him.

224
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,360
In the bigger picture,

225
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,530
it's to stabilize the morale of the army.

226
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,490
But at the end of the day,

227
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,810
this is also my duty.

228
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:51,850
Besides,

229
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,770
Ying coming to He County with him on her own accord

230
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,130
means they are getting along well.

231
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:00,970
But

232
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,640
Ying and I are like siblings.

233
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,910
Now she married Li Tongguang,

234
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,840
Li Tongguang's seniority suddenly increased.

235
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,410
Looking at it now,

236
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:11,730
I can't

237
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,080
teach him a lesson easily in the future.

238
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,170
So beautiful.

239
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,040
You've really learnt bad things from Yu Shisan.

240
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,730
You're such a sweet talker now.

241
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,380
I...

242
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,590
I didn't say you're beautiful.

243
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:56,010
I meant, look how beautiful the snow is.

244
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:02,610
Is this your first time seeing snow?

245
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,090
Of course not.

246
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:07,610
But

247
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,260
I've never seen snow with you.

248
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:14,850
Okay.

249
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,570
Let's watch the snow together.

250
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,810
Why aren't you coming closer?

251
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,140
Why should I do that?

252
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,410
What do you mean?

253
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,090
When watching the snow,

254
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,130
shouldn't the lady lean on the man's shoulder?

255
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,450
Why can't it be the man leaning on the lady's shoulder?

256
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,240
I...

257
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:41,650
You dare to disobey?

258
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,850
Of course I'm going to disoby.

259
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,120
I'm a man.

260
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,730
I...

261
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:53,770
How could I not listen to you?

262
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,510
[Two days later]

263
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,410
Why didn't you let him sleep inside?

264
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,170
He refused.

265
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,850
He said he wanted to share weal and woe with the soldiers.

266
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,850
Actually, it's been tough on you

267
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:48,970
these days too,

268
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,580
right?

269
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:57,730
We'll take care of

270
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:59,650
the war.

271
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:01,930
Just keep an eye on the city.

272
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,579
By the way,

273
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,510
how are you getting along with Jiu?

274
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,010
Be honest.

275
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:16,670
It's pretty good.

276
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,940
We really respect each other.

277
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:20,900
We are very polite to each other.

278
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,250
Don't worry.

279
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,170
As long as I can survive this time,

280
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:27,810
even for the alliance

281
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:30,370
between the two states of An and Wu to last long,

282
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,330
I will get along with him well.

283
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,980
But in my heart,

284
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,640
I'm still thinking about Yuan Lu.

285
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:46,980
Today,

286
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,810
Yuanzhou

287
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,210
gave me Yuan Lu's amulet badge.

288
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,450
I will put it together

289
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:00,330
with the thunderbomb Yuan Lu gave me.

290
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:06,490
A few days ago,

291
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,810
I saw the chief of Hungry Ghost Path.

292
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,100
That made me think of him.

293
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,250
Today,

294
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:19,010
I saw the Fire Caltrops he once mentioned to me.

295
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,250
And that made me think of him again.

296
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,330
Even when my hair turns white

297
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,010
and my teeth fall off,

298
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,600
but when my grandchildren

299
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,670
are eating sugar candies,

300
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,860
I will definitely still think of him.

301
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,060
I will think of him too.

302
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,990
Ruyi.

303
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,360
Why are you crying?

304
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,520
A few months ago,

305
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:00,490
I was still in so much agony for Zheng Qingyun.

306
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:02,650
Now,

307
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,090
I'm Li Tongguang's wife,

308
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,730
yet in my heart,

309
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm still thinking about Yuan Lu.

310
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,730
Isn't that a bad?

311
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:16,700
Who said so?

312
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,790
As long as you have a clear conscience,

313
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,610
Women who loved

314
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,210
only one person

315
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,090
or many people in their life

316
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,420
all deserve respect.

317
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,410
Yuanzhou will be in danger.

318
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,500
What if, in a few years,

319
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,170
you meet someone that is more handsome

320
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,490
and considerate than him?

321
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:48,330
Ying,

322
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:49,890
you've grown up.

323
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:51,980
No, no.

324
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,330
-How dare you speak ill of Yuanzhou?
-No, no.

325
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,490
Let me tell you.

326
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,490
-Don’t think I dare not beat you because you're grown up.
-No, no.

327
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,210
Don't you think!

328
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,130
I was talking nonsense.

329
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:06,900
Come.

330
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,790
Don't fall in love with someone else.

331
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,170
You have no confidence in yourself?

332
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,170
Do it for the sake of

333
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,890
our future children.

334
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,810
I was teasing Ying

335
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,890
to make her happy.

336
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,890
After all, she has experienced a lot these days.

337
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,250
There's fire over there.

338
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,120
How about I grill some meat for you?

339
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,930
You haven't tried my cooking, have you?

340
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:00,490
You know

341
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,840
I used to be a military chef.

342
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,310
Just wait a little longer. It'll be ready soon.

343
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,550
You said

344
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,650
you would be secretly afraid

345
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:16,250
before you go on a mission every time.

346
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,230
What about this time?

347
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:22,490
This time,

348
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,540
I'm not afraid at all.

349
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,210
Because I have you by my side.

350
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:32,650
Besides,

351
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:35,610
there's also Sun Lang,

352
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,810
Qian Zhao,

353
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,330
and Yuan Lu.

354
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:40,810
They've become stars.

355
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,170
And are always with us.

356
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,290
It's daytime.

357
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,170
There are no stars.

358
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,690
I think

359
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,470
people don't turn into stars.

360
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,470
Maybe there is no six stages of reincarnation in the world.

361
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,250
Death is like lights going out.

362
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,380
There will be no afterlife.

363
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,650
But because we can only live once,

364
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,940
can we better understand the value of life.

365
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,610
Although I was comforting Ying just now,

366
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,380
this time,

367
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,180
I'm scared too.

368
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,020
I'm afraid

369
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,410
♫If the world is like a wave♫

370
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,810
that if we can't defend He County,

371
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,930
♫Drowning the past♫

372
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:33,880
when I die,

373
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,180
♫Who will steer the boat with me into the distance♫

374
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,260
you won't be by my side.

375
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:42,420
That won't happen.

376

♫Look through the world filled with clouds♫

377
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,490
I promise.

♫The blade's glint hides the tears♫

379
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,890
♫Love is a lie between one's lips♫

380
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:52,810
Your promises never count.

381
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,170
♫Searching for normality between life and death for you♫

382
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,590
You promised me long ago

383
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:56,970
that you'd give me a child.

384
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,720
But you went back on it in the blink of an eye.

385
00:22:59,010 --> 00:22:59,840
♫I waited, but I couldn't have♫

386
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,110
We've been married for so long.

387
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:01,920
You haven't fulfilled it yet.

388
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,060
♫Two people for eternity♫

389
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,270
I understand now.

391
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,340
So you're waiting for me here.

♫This long journey where one shadow became two♫

393
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,800
It seems you

394
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,770
just want my body.

395
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:16,130
Tell me.

396
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:16,640
Do you want it braised or steamed?

397
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,100
♫At the end of the road, it's a dream♫

398
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,090
I want to eat it raw.

Yu Shisan.

407
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,400
I'm cold too.

408
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,070
You're envious?

409
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,130
You want everything others have.

410
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,770
Can't you just hug me?

411
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:43,760
Who knows?

412
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,850
Maybe the Beipan people will charge in soon.

413
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,960
I might die on the spot.

414
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,210
Is it that hard for you to give me a hug?

415
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,120
Don't jinx it.

416
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,650
You don't believe me?

417
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:58,170
Don't worry.

418
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,690
I promise you.

419
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,330
Yu Shisan,

420
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,940
will give it my all

421
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,010
to protect this place.

422
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:05,510
I promise you will...

423
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,600
live happily

424
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,770
and prettily

425
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,210
for the next few decades.

426
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:12,980
I don't want to listen about the future.

427
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,170
Just talk about the present and us.

428
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,810
You like me.

429
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,610
You've been with me these days

430
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,130
and fought with me,

431
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,610
comforting and encouraging me.

432
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,610
I can feel

433
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:27,970
what you feel towards me.

434
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,610
Yes.

435
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,100
I like you.

436
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,520
But I like Beauty

437
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,520
I like Princess Ying too.

438
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:50,950
♫Suddenly encountering the joy of meeting and the sorrow of parting♫

439
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,280
I like all

440
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,430
nice and cute girls in this world.

441
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:57,900
The biggest wish

442
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,910
♫Like rain and snow flying everywhere♫

443
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,640
people like me have in our lives

444
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,190
is to drink the strongest wine,

445
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,050
make the best friends,

446
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,410
fight the best wars,

447
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,110
♫Just like the tears in the corners of our eyes♫

448
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,520
and look at the most beautiful girls.

449
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:09,730
So

450
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,040
I can only drift

451
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,700
♫They're so close to falling♫

452
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,560
and fly about.

453
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,100
I'm not suited to stop.

454
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,340
♫I'm afraid the world is like water♫

♫Drowning you and me, there's no way out♫

458
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,690
In this situation, and in this atmosphere,

459
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,310
if I really hugged you,

460
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:37,510

♫Is the end of our story♫

466
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,740
You want us to spend the rest of our lives

being tired of each other

468
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:55,220

I don't care. I won't let you go.

I'm the Female Leader of Shaxi,

I'm ordering you.

If I don't allow you to leave, you aren't allowed to leave.

I've contacted Ning Yuanzhou through the messenger pigeon.

510
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,330
They can't hold on any longer.

511
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,370
But Your Majesty,

512
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,010
the soldiers are already exhausted.

513
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,930
We don't know when the snow will stop.

514
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,460
We can't speed up anymore.

515
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,270
Faster!

516
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,010
Yes!

517
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,650
Is there no man left in An?

518
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,890
No one is coming out to fight?

519
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,570
Where are the people?

520
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,410
Bring the people here.

521
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:20,410
Yuanzhou.

522
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:22,930
How is it going?

523
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,480
The Beipan soldiers are cunning.

524
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,060
They didn't attack the city today all together today.

525
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,570
Instead, they asked Left Worthy Prince to set up the formation.

526
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,530
Could this be a trap?

527
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,140
Let's guard the city gate first.

528
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,290
If anything happens, we can go down immediately.

529
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:43,360
-General!
-General!

530
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,630
-Help!
-Help us! General!

531
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,660
Help us!

532
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,490
We don't want to die! General!

533
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,880
Listen, people of An.

534
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:51,970
Either drop your weapons and surrender,

535
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:53,330
or...

536
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,530
Your Highness.

537
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,050
These are the compatriots

538
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,450
who fought with us in the previous few battles.

539
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,360
Your Highness.

540
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,190
You can't be soft-hearted now.

541
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:02,820
These are our compatriots.

542
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,570
The people in He County are also our compatriots.

543
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,610
If we hand over the weapons now, we'll surely lose.

544
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,300
You're right.

545
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,650
We have the lives of

546
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:15,610
thousands of people in He County on us.

547
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:16,930
I can't be soft-hearted.

548
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,660
But to step on our An's compatriots' dead bodies when we fight our enemies

549
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,880
is something I can't do either.

550
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:22,210
Attention, generals!

551
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,950
Split into two wings,

552
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,290
go to the back from the sides

553
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:26,610
and surround Beipan from both left and right side.

554
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,330
Kill!

555
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:37,730
Kill!

556
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:43,020
Kill!

557
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,430
This won't do.

558
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,670
If we split into two wings, our forces will be reduced.

559
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,590
We don't have as many people as they do.

560
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,370
As long as their king comes from there,

561
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,800
we will be surrounded.

562
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,680
Commandant Zhang, guard the city gate.

563
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,810
Okau. Strengthen the defense.

564
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:00,210
Ruyi. Shisan.

565
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:02,490
Come with me to rescue Duke Qing.

566
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,120
Yes.

567
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,130
We'll break through from there

568
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,480
and meet up with Ruyi.

569
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,590
Okay.

570
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,300
Duke Qing, save me!

571
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:19,660
Duke Qing!

572
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,570
You can’t go! It might be a trap!

573
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,440
He has been with me since he was a kid.

574
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,240
Deng Hui.

575
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,100
Deng Hui!

576
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,390
Deng Hui...

577
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,160
On the battlefield,

578
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,370
you can't be soft-hearted.

579
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,219
All the more you can't

580
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:14,920
as a regent.

581
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:16,940
Deng Hui...

582
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:21,300
Deng Hui!

583
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:22,929
Deng Hui!

584
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,530
Take His Highness back to the city on the horse.

585
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:31,090
Your Highness!

586
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:32,070
Let go!

587
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:34,340
I killed him.

588
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:35,960
I can’t leave.

589
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,970
We fell for the trick of the Beipan people.

590
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,510
We might die here this time.

591
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,730
What are you talking about?

592
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,360
We've been through so many difficulties.

593
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,650
We've seen all kinds of scenarios.

594
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:25,460
There's a horse over there.

595
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,740
We can go back to the city after grabbing the horse.

596
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:27,760
No.

597
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:29,210
If we stick together, we will be too big of a targe.

598
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,230
You ride this horse.

599
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,500
There's a Beipan cavalry there.

600
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:32,890
I'll go steal his horse.

601
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,600
Wait.

602
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,030
Do you regret it?

603
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,670
Since I tricked you out in the name of a beautiful princess?

604
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,710
What is there to regret?

605
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:45,970
I, Yu Shisan,

606
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,490
will drink the strongest wine,

607
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:49,850
see the most beautiful girls,

608
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:50,930
make the best friends,

609
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:52,530
and fight the most amazing wars in my life.

610
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:06,540
I'll head off first.

611
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,330
See you in the city.

612
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,690
See you in the city.

613
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:41,810
Chu Yue!

614
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,260
Kill!

615
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,370
Sit tight. I'll take you back.

616
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:23,050
Yu Shisan.

617
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,770
Does this mean we've been through thick and thin together?

618
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,030
Yes.

619
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,350
Yu Shisan...

620
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,000
Yu Shisan!

621
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,960
Yu Shisan!

622
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:21,340
Yu Shisan!

623
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,590
Yu Shisan.

624
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,190
I'm here.

625
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,800
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

626
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,630
What's wrong with my eyes?

627
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,390
I can't open my eyes.

628
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:36,340
It's okay.

629
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,720
It's lime in the fire caltrops.

630
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:40,080
Don't rub it.

631
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,660
Wash it with clean oil when we are abck

632
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,960
and you can see again.

633
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,960
What if I become blind?

634
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:46,830
You won't.

635
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:48,410
If you become blind,

636
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,990
I'll be the most flamboyant playboy

637
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:52,330
you see in your life.

638
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:55,380
Are you okay? Are you okay?

639
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:58,760
I'm Yu Shisan.

640
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,010
How could anything happen to me?

641
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,610
Come, get up.

642
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,250
Let's go.

643
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:22,450
Come. Get on.

644
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:29,750
How is it?

645
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:31,470
Can you see the location of the city gate?

646
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,100
Yes.

647
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:38,730
Good.

648
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,020
That's very good.

649
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:43,090
You go back first.

650
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:45,650
Wh-Where are you going?

651
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,510
Why aren't you going with me?

652
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:51,090
Ning is waiting for me to save the damsel in distress.

653
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,170
How can I be absent?

654
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:56,210
Don't worry.

655
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,010
I'll be back soon.
