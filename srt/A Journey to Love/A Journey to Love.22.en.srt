[Bianzhou, the State of An]

5
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,200
Dad!

6
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:15,850
Dad!

7
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,030
This money is enough to last you for a while.

8
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,530
Don't ever come to her again.

9
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,380
Dad!

10
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,780
We're in Bianzhou, the State of An.

11
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,829
There are many wild animals lurking around.

12
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,100
You must be in a good mood

13
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,810
to have come here alone

14
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,230
instead of resting with the delegation.

15
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,310
Is this mountain yours?

16
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,140
Did you plant these trees?

17
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,940
Why can't I come here?

18
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,370
Wait.

19
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,510
I just want to say

20
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,900
Bianzhou has great dates.

21
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,140
Princess, give me a minute.

22
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:50,770
I was so clumsy.

23
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,650
Marquis, I didn't know you were such a foodie.

24
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,670
They're not for me but for my master.

25
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,800
She liked dates.

26
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:01,330
It's true.

27
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,750
She said she used to practice martial arts here.

28
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,110
So I want to pick some dates

29
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,520
and bring them to her memorial tablet

30
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,260
after we arrive in Yuzhou.

31
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,500
Your master is buried in Yuzhou?

32
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:12,950
No, in An Capital.

33
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,590
I'm always away from home fighting in wars.

34
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,089
I was worried that I couldn't make it back to her on special days,

35
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,750
so I set memorial tablets for her

36
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,310
in all the famous temples around the country.

37
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,860
That way, I can visit her wherever I am.

38
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,470
You don't need to tell me all that.

39
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,100
I'm done being your master's substitute.

40
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,480
Sorry.

41
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,310
I just

42
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,320
can't help it.

43
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,659
But

44
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,060
if your master knew

45
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,830
you cared for her so much,

46
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,270
she'd be very glad.

47
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:51,830
Really?

48
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,340
Yes.

49
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,500
Try some.

50
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,120
Try some.

51
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,220
I don't eat such countryside food.

52
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,110
I'm not giving them to you

53
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:08,910
because my master liked dates.

54
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,410
I just want to thank you.

55
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,510
Thank you for what you just said.

56
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,540
Try one. It's really sweet.

57
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,030
Try one.

58
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,680
Not bad.

59
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,840
Prince Li is quite immature.

60
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,600
Is it tiring to take care of him?

61
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,830
How long does it take

62
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,350
to walk from Shengzhou to Wu Capital?

63
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,150
Are you testing me?

64
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,630
No.

65
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,060
I just

66
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,190
want to talk to you.

67
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,550
Marquis Changqing, you're in charge of Yulin Guards

68
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,030
and have beaten the emperor of Wu.

69
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,910
You enjoyed insulting and teasing me before.

70
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,450
Why are you suddenly playing innocent now?

71
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,330
I wasn't thinking straight before.

72
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:20,540
Sorry.

73
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,790
Princess.

74
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,630
When you smile,

75
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,230
you look very much like my master.

76
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,490
But you've been ignoring me these days.

77
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,470
Why should I be nice to you?

78
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,480
To save you, Yuanzhou

79
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,690
got hurt so badly.

80
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:44,780
He helped you,

81
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,140
but you drugged his food.

82
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:51,680
Princess.

83
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,570
You should know

84
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,700
what Mr. Ning said to me that night.

85
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,470
Roughly.

86
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,100
He had a point,

87
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,990
but he was being melodramatic.

88
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,430
That's why

89
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,560
I've been hesitating.

90
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,220
I thought about it all the way and my head hurt.

91
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,090
So I came out for some fresh air

92
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,410
when the delegation took a rest.

93
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,540
Princess.

94
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,630
Do you think I should listen to him?

95
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,410
You're asking me?

96
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,190
I agree with him, of course.

97
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,840
I won't make any decisions for you.

98
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,260
But I can assure you

99
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,580
that Yuanzhou is a grateful person.

100
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,020
You saved his life,

101
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,780
so he'll never harm you.

102
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,310
Besides, Yuanzhou is very resourceful.

103
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,630
You can doubt his conclusion,

104
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,830
but his political analysis

105
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,460
has definitely hit the nail.

106
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,150
You trust him so much.

107
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,530
I picked him out at first sight.

108
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,120
Of course I trust him.

109
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,680
No way!

110
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,950
I don't want any more bread.

111
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,710
My hands tremble when I hold the bow now.

112
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,310
It'll be dangerous if I miss the target.

113
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,620
You can eat it or not.

114
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,550
If you don't eat it, someone else will.

115
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,230
Are you feeling better?

116
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:16,520
Look.

117
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,140
Princess, please keep this.

118
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,150
Forget it. I'll have some bread.

119
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:32,890
Okay. Let's eat bread.

120
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:33,950
-Let's eat bread. 
-I'll have three pieces.

121
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,780
I'm not worried. Neither should you be.

122
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,110
Sister.

123
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:42,710
Let me take a look.

124
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,070
Where did you get these dates? They're so fresh.

125
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:48,730
Thank you, Marquis.

126
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,100
You haven't tried dates here, have you?

127
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:51,980
You can have them all.

128
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,490
Have them washed before you eat them.

129
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,070
Okay.

130
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:55,900
I'll wait for you in the carriage.

131
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,340
This one is so big.

132
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,710
What's wrong with you?

133
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,190
I picked them

134
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,710
and brought them here.

135
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,470
What? I can't knock it out of your hand?

136
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,330
I…

137
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,920
Ruyi.

138
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,890
Li Tongguang.

139
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,170
How could you be so rude to His Highness?

140
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,870
I just knocked a date out of his hand.

141
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,590
What? Is he so precious

142
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,930
that everyone has to bend to his will?

143
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,120
Is it a crime to not like him?

144
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,410
You're an adult. Why are you…

145
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,360
It's none of your business.

146
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,740
A man of your age shouldn't be so childish.

147
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,270
Wait.

148
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,620
What?

149
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,710
I've come to a decision.

150
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:12,960
About what?

151
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,190
I'm a man of my word.

152
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,710
From now on,

153
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,240
I'll do my best to help you rescue your emperor.

154
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,310
But you still can't promise

155
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,410
to stay away from my princess?

156
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:29,690
Mr. Ning.

157
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,710
Don't be so cruel.

158
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,910
Although I'm only 22 years old,

159
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,990
in this world,

160
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,270
there are not many things

161
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,340
that can make me happy.

162
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,710
What does that have to do with me?

163
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,710
To show my sincerity,

164
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,010
I'll tell you something.

165
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,710
Liudao Hall arranged for some men

166
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,870
to protect your emperor, right?

167
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,030
When I took down your emperor,

168
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,720
some of them died in that fight.

169
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,990
Do you mean Chai Ming and the others?

170
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,180
The head of the guards was indeed surnamed Chai.

171
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,870
I was ordered by my superior

172
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,440
to dump their bodies in the river.

173
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,890
But I thought loyal soldiers like them

174
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,870
deserved better than ending up floating in the river.

175
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,130
So I asked Zhu Yin to get several men

176
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,130
to bury them on the riverbank at night.

177
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,150
Where are they now?

178
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,230
Not far from here.

179
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,250
If you hurry,

180
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,350
you can reach that place soon.

181
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,510
I found one!

182
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,820
He's here!

183
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,470
Xiaoyu. It's Shi Xiaoyu!

184
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,470
His ring finger and little finger

185
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,790
were cut off when he tried

186
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,750
to catch a bandit called Shen Jiayan.

187
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,990
I can recognize him.

188
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:15,900
This is Yan.

189
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,340
He had old injuries in his lungs

190
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,720
and often took lung support pills.

191
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,190
Keep digging.

192
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:45,940
[Chai Ming]

193
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,640
Ming.

194
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,870
I'll take you home.

195
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:18,880
Mr. Qian is…

196
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,570
That's Chai Ming.

197
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,310
When Chai Ming worked night shifts in the court,

198
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,060
Qian was the closest to him.

199
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:29,890
You fought at Guanshan.

200
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,760
You fell at Guideyuan.

201
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,430
Your bravery and loyalty

202
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,470
will forever be remembered.

203
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,510
Liudao Hall mourns for you.

204
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,030
Wu grieves for you.

205
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,180
We feel honored to have fought with you.

206
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,550
You can rest in peace now.

207
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:54,440
Your Highness.

208
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:57,110
These men

209
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,790
were from the Heaven Path and died on the battlefield

210
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,830
for your brother.

211
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:34,640
Be back, wandering souls. You can rest in peace now.

212
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:38,730
Be back, wandering souls. You can rest in peace now.

You can't blame the enemies.

226
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,910

238

Now,

240
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,130
only by working with him

241
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,750

249

Yes!

250
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,960
Let's set off to Guideyuan now.

251
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,600
[Guideyuan, the State of An]

252
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,510
Red Emissary Zhu Ji and her 29 subordinates

253
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:47,960
[Scarlet Guards' Guideyuan Branch]

254
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,430
were all murdered.

255
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,350
After investigation,

256
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,000
we suspect they were killed by a traitor called Ruyi from Wu Capital Branch.

257
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,430
That killer is ruthless and cunning.

258
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,600
She may have sneaked into An.

259
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,670
Whoever receives this order

260
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,910
shall find her and kill her on the spot.

261
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,600
Kill her on the spot?

262
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,190
Lately, the headquarters

263
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,520
have kept issuing confusing orders like this.

264
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,030
They've transferred away the best of our guards

265
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,910
for some secret mission

266
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,120
and are now giving us a hot potato.

267
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:18,270
This woman called Ruyi is so good at martial arts.

268
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,150
She's killed both Red Emissaries

269
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,510
and Scarlet Emissaries.

270
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,630
What can a Purple Emissary like me do?

271
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:24,850
Do they want me to get killed?

272
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,910
My Lord, we've got an urgent message from Guideyuan.

273
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,560
Wu's delegation has arrived in Guideyuan.

274
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,750
They're so fast.

275
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,910
Send a messenger pigeon back.

276
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:42,230
Yes.

277
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:05,500
[I'll do my best to carry out the order of killing the murderer called Ruyi. Moreover, Wu's delegation has arrived in Guideyuan.]

278
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:05,500
[Guideyuan Branch]

279
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,480
Sure enough.

280
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,990
The headquarters of Scarlet Guards don't know you're Ren Xin.

281
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:14,470
They only know the murderer who killed Zhu Ji is called Ruyi.

282
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,110
The letter doesn't mention killing Li Tongguang.

283
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,970
Let him find it out himself after returning to An Capital.

284
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:32,950
By the way,

285
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,460
you've been teaching Ying these days

286
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,500
but never mentioned

287
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,940
how to take revenge after arriving in the State of An.

288
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,800
I've got a plan.

289
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,380
But I want you to stay out of it for now.

290
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:47,700
I…

291
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,090
Don't worry.

292
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,910
You have your duties to fulfill.

293
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,250
I'll settle my feud with Scarlet Guards myself.

294
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,280
I'll ask you for help if I can't handle it myself.

295
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:04,720
Okay.

296
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,150
I want to thank you

297
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,540
for mourning Chai Ming and the other guards with me just now.

298
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:17,430
Don't mention it.

299
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,190
They were your brothers.

300
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,690
I paid my respects to them with you.

301
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,110
I don't feel bad about it.

302
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:28,630
Besides,

303
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,030
I envy them very much.

304
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,880
Envy them?

305
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,630
Yuan Lu told me

306
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,680
Liudao Hall does the same every year

307
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,710
on Tomb Sweeping Day and Ghost Festival

308
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,710
to honor the dead.

309
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,520
Scarlet Guards don't do that.

310
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,160
The dead guards

311
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,330
will all quietly

312
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,230
be sent to the crematory.

313
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:58,740
They have no graves or memorial tablets,

314
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,270
let alone people mourning them.

315
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,750
After we arrive in An Capital,

316
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,150
if you want to pay respects to them,

317
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:16,300
I'll go with you.

318
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,100
Unfortunately,

319
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,340
I only remember the real names of some of them.

320
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,800
When Scarlet Guards are alive,

321
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,160
they're called by code names instead of their real names.

322
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,320
Their facial features, personalities, and family backgrounds

323
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,110
are all recorded in detail

324
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,790
in case they run away.

325
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,350
But once they die,

326
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,950
their names will be erased

327
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:50,910
as if those people

328
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,040
have never existed.

329
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,380
What makes me sad

330
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,150
is that in the past,

331
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,430
I didn't think there was anything wrong

332
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,350
with that.

333
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,400
I didn't realize until just now

334
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,620
that they also deserved to be remembered.

335
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,580
Are you going to give me candy whenever I feel low?

336
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,950
I once worked undercover in An Capital.

337
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:02,830
If you need my help with Scarlet Guards,

338
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:04,910
you must tell me.

339
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,030
When you worked undercover in An Capital,

340
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:11,920
what did you do for a living?

341
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:28,170
I just remembered.

342
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:31,030
Qian Zhao wants to talk with me about our next move.

343
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,710
W-We need to go back now.

344
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,740
You haven't answered me.

345
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,500
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

346
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:37,800
Qian Zhao is waiting for me.

347
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,070
Talking to him is more important.

348
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:43,690
Shisan.

349
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,050
I asked again and again

350
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,810
but Yuanzhou wouldn't answer me.

351
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,550
What did he do for a living

352
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,940
when he stayed in An Capital?

353
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,110
He used to…

354
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,190
I don't know him that well.

355
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:56,810
Go ask Yuan Lu.

356
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:01,490
I can't tell you.

357
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,350
I really can't tell you.

358
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:05,150
If I do, Boss Ning will kill me.

359
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,070
Are you asking me?

360
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,860
I don't know.

361
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,300
I hadn't joined Scarlet Guards at that time.

362
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:28,800
Sorry, Liudao Hall.

363
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,980
Water. I need water.

364
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,510
Do you really want to know?

365
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:43,930
Buddha said,

366
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,480
it can't be told.

367
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,880
Seriously? You're all keeping it from me!

368
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,010
Sorry.

369
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,190
Marquis Changqing, what do want this time?

370
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,420
Sorry.

371
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,950
I hurried here to tell you something.

372
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,470
What's it?

373
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,790
A message came from the outpost.

374
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,150
The bridge ahead collapsed.

375
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,070
We have to take the mountain road.

376
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,550
After we get over this mountain,

377
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,910
you can see An Capital.

378
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,150
So that is An Capital.

379
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,490
Do you think

380
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,870
I can leave that place in one piece

381
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,390
with my brother?

382
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,020
Nothing is impossible.

383
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,350
Yes!

384
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:01,570
[Juntian Gate]

385
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,150
His Highness

386
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:29,120
[Shentu Qing, the Second Prince's wingman]

387
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:29,230
hates it when that guy hogs all the attention.

388
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:30,980
Go send some gifts

389
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,830
to our guests from Wu.

390
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:33,730
Yes.

391
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,480
Looks like

392
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,770
this prince is entering the city

393
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,190
in a more graceful way than his brother did.

394
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,490
Yeah.

395
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:38,240
[Siyi Pavilion, An Capital]

396
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,430
Now that you've safely arrived in An Capital,

397
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,510
my mission as the Commissioner for Presentations is complete.

398
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:59,310
You'll stay at Siyi Pavilion.

399
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,390
The vice minister of Honglu Temple who came with me

400
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,630
will come here every three days.

401
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,350
If you need anything,

402
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,180
just tell him.

403
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:07,820
Wait.

404
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:11,190
Why will the vice minister come here every three days?

405
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,030
Shouldn't your emperor summon me right away?

406
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,390
So you know

407
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,580
you need to be summoned.

408
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,550
If His Majesty wants to meet you, he'll summon you.

409
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,270
If he doesn't summon you, you won't meet him.

410
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:29,880
I'll leave.

411
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,070
Many Scarlet Guards know my master.

412
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,600
Be careful.

413
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,890
I hate Marquis Changqing.

414
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,670
He's only nice

415
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:47,710
when talking to Ruyi.

416
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,670
Other times, he's always testy.

417
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,450
I don't like him either.

418
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,490
But we've joined hands with him

419
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:59,030
and he'll secretly send us messages in the future.

420
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,880
He behaved that way just now

421
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,170
because that was how envoys from an enemy country are usually treated.

422
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,110
The goal is to snub us.

423
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,860
It's normal.

424
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,110
I misunderstood him.

425
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,070
Mr. Ning.

426
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,030
When will the emperor of An

427
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:19,550
meet me?

428
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,260
In three days at least.

429
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,550
It's fine.

430
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,670
We're all exhausted from the journey.

431
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,380
We can use some rest.

432
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:34,530
Boys.

433
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,180
Let's go pull the nails in the courtyard.

434
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,200
Yes.

435
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:45,600
[11 in the evening, Siyi Pavilion]

436
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,070
What?

437
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,030
How can you ask His Highness to enter the court at midnight?

438
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:51,710
Yeah.

439
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,350
His Highness just went to bed.

440
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:53,750
How…

441
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,550
It's His Majesty's order.

442
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,540
What? Are you going to disobey it?

443
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,450
What's going on?

444
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,750
Your Highness.

445
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,880
A eunuch from An's court came with the emperor's order.

446
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,790
Here is His Majesty's oral order.

447
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:11,670
Prince Li of Wu is to enter the court to meet His Majesty instantly.

448
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,230
It's not even one in the morning.

449
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,070
The court meeting starts at five.

450
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,970
Many officials get up at one to make preparations.

451
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,840
-You…
-To summon Prince Li of Wu,

452
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,000
you need an imperial edict.

453
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:27,270
What? Didn't you hear me?

454
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:30,240
It's an oral order. There's no imperial edict.

455
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,950
Are you going to disobey the order?

456
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,030
Fine.

457
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:38,050
I'll go back to the court and tell His Majesty.

458
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,710
Wait.

459
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,480
I didn't say I wouldn't go.

460
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,910
How dare you twist my words?

461
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,980
Then I'll wait for you

462
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:49,730
in the court.

463
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:52,950
Let's go.

464
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:54,870
He…

465
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:58,390
An people are so rude.

466
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,710
They're doing this to torture His Highness.

467
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,060
On our way here,

468
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,450
I rehearsed with you guys

469
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:05,420
many times.

470
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:06,910
I'm prepared.

471
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,190
I can enter the court anytime.

472
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:12,380
Bring me the gift for the emperor of An now.

473
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:13,140
Okay.

474
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,280
Get prepared. We'll enter the court with His Highness.

475
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,410
According to the laws of An,

476
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,470
envoys from foreign countries

477
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,990
can't enter the court with guards.

478
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:47,670
What did you say?

479
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,310
He's my valet.

480
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:57,290
Here is a gift and a letter for your emperor.

481
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:14,050
Your Highness.

482
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,190
We'll wait for you outside.

483
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,989
Don't panic. Don't panic.

484
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:38,870
Calm down.

485
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,690
Calm down.

486
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,730
Think about why they are doing this.

487
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:51,110
Has something gone wrong?

488
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,389
The order is to knock him down a peg.

489
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:54,530
What if…

490
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,520
Open the door.

491
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:57,390
Report it if anything has happened.

492
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,520
Where is he?

493
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,250
Where is he?

494
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,770
I heard his voice just now.

495
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,070
Where did he go?

496
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,150
This is so strange.

497
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:19,310
Who's there?

498
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,840
What are you looking for?

499
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:25,570
I've been waiting for quite a while.

500
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:27,370
Lead the way now.

501
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,030
Tracker butterfly. It's a tracker butterfly.

502
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,230
I made a deal with Her Highness.

503
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,710
After she enters the court safely,

504
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,870
she'll release the tracker butterfly.

505
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:57,510
Good.

506
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,010
I hope Her Highness can soon meet the emperor of An.

507
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:02,810
She's passed the first test.

508
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,470
Everything will go smoothly after it.

509
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:37,410
Please have a seat, Your Highness.

510
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,590
He looks so young

511
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,430
but is quite composed.

512
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:50,550
Yes.

513
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:02,180
[At noon, in the court of An]

514
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:02,310
Beipan?

515
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:05,710
The tribes in Beipan

516
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:08,310
have been quiet for decades.

517
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,310
Why do they have to cause me trouble

518
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:13,110
when I'm about to wage war on the State of Chu?

519
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,510
I can't spare so many troops

520
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,990
to defend Tianmenguan.

521
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:21,540
Give those three bodies to the Ministry of Justice

522
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,430
for identification.

523
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,590
Tell Shabei Tribe to keep an eye on them.

524
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:27,110
That's all I can do.

525
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,280
What's it?

526
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,730
Your Majesty.

527
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,360
Yang Ying is still waiting in the side hall.

528
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,640
He's patient for his age.

529
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,790
I see. Keep him waiting.

530
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:59,070
After the small court meeting is over

531
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,930
and I have dinner, I'll meet him.

532
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:09,050
Go on.

533
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,360
Yes.

534
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:16,050
The first group of assassins who attacked me,

535
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,000
I suspect they were Scarlet Guards.

536
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,150
What?

537
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,590
I couldn't believe it either at first.

538
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,770
After all, Scarlet Guards are your private guards

539
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:27,150
and Commander Deng is so loyal.

540
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:27,910
Enough.

541
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,680
I need evidence.

542
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:47,990
Your Highness, don't you want to ask when His Majesty will meet you?

543
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,550
My brother, the regent, is always busy.

544
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,930
Your emperor must be very busy too.

545
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:01,010
He'll meet me when he has spare time.

546
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,830
Why should I be anxious?

547
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,060
Your Highness, please have some food.

548
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:26,510
No need.

549
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,860
My brother is held captive here.

550
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:33,930
I don't think he can enjoy such delicate desserts.

551
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,090
How can I enjoy them alone?

552
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:37,790
Besides,

553
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,770
if I eat and drink,

554
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:44,110
nature will call later

555
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,360
and I may behave unbecomingly.

556
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,870
Isn't that what you're waiting to see?

557
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:44,790
He hasn't eaten or drunk anything?

558
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,830
Both of you shall leave. Let's see if he'll panic.

559
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,300
We…

560
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,570
If anything happens, I'll take responsibility.

561
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:20,190
Your Highness, wait.

562
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,400
Your Highness.

563
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,640
It's been a whole day.

564
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,070
You finally showed up.

565
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,280
I was busy during the day

566
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,470
reporting to the Ministry of Rites what happened during our journey.

567
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,110
I didn't mean to keep you waiting.

568
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,950
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

569
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,650
But you're leaving the court without permission. It's…

570
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:44,410
Without permission?

571
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:53,070
Since your emperor is too busy to meet me,

572
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:56,060
I'll leave now and come back tomorrow.

573
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,110
What's wrong with it?

574
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:03,100
I'm not allowed to leave even when your emperor can't make time to see me.

575
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:05,910
Is this how people here treat their guests?

576
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,240
Is your emperor not only snubbing me

577
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,860
but also trying to set me up?

578
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:31,740
Your Highness.

579
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:32,830
Move aside.

580
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:34,110
Your Highness.

581
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:40,510
You don't need to kneel to me.

582
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:47,120
Your Highness. Your Highness.

583
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,840
I've sent a eunuch to report to His Majesty.

584
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,940
Please wait a little longer, Your Highness.

585
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:57,710
You look so nervous.

586
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:00,630
Are you worried that I won't come back

587
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:01,750
if I leave now?

588
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:03,710
Don't worry.

589
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,230
I'll come again tomorrow.

590
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:08,510
But my patience is not infinite.

591
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:10,990
If within three days,

592
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,910
I can't get a clear answer from your emperor

593
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:16,470
about when I can meet my brother,

594
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:20,170
I'll go back to Wu immediately.

595
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,990
I didn't hold any position in the court

596
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:25,370
and had no intention of getting involved in state affairs.

597
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,820
No matter which of my brothers ascends the throne,

598
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,960
I'll still be a respected prince.

599
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:33,730
Also,

600
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:37,250
don't think

601
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:38,960
just by holding me captive,

602
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,310
you can have those 100,000 taels of gold.

603
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:47,310
After all, Liudao Hall

604
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:50,930
has hundreds of sworn soldiers in this country.

605
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,400
They won't just stand by.

606
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,610
You can ward against them for one month or two.

607
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:57,020
But can you ward against them for a few years?

608
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:02,540
Your Highness.

609
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,230
Please.

610
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:08,010
Your Highness.
