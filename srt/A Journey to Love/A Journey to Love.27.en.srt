[Episode 27]

4
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,150
But I don't care.

5
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,920
I only want my master.

6
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,190
I only want my master!

7
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,550
OK.

8
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:08,650
Follow me.

9
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,000
Retreat.

10
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,579
Beauty.

11
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,290
Don't worry, Beauty.

12
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:27,470
Leave it to Ning.

13
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,310
Let go of me!

14
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,500
Have you calmed down?

15
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:45,970
Let go of me!

16
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,630
Have you calmed down?

17
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,550
How does it feel to be defenseless?

18
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,450
Listen.

19
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,070
If it weren't for your master,

20
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,630
I wouldn't let you leave here alive.

21
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,910
I hope this is the last time you go crazy.

22
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,680
I'm not crazy.

23
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,350
I just don't understand

24
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,710
why Master did this to me.

25
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,520
Why?

26
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,190
Think about what you've done.

27
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,320
You seriously injured His Highness

28
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,750
and people from the Liudao Hall.

29
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,640
And your

30
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,110
crazy and dirty tricks.

31
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,910
I already told you a few days ago.

32
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,550
Stay away from my Ruyi.

33
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,460
You have the right to like someone.

34
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,950
But if you disturb her,

35
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,000
make her unhappy,

36
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,150
or hurt people from the Liudao Hall and His Highness,

37
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,410
I'll make you suffer.

38
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,350
You won't be able to live a safe life either.

39
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,510
Don't try to scare me.

40
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,310
I just want her to give me another chance.

41
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,270
Am I wrong?

42
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,510
Are you wrong?

43
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,350
Do you think

44
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,120
everyone in this world should revolve around you

45
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,730
and that everything has to go your way?

46
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,030
You keep saying

47
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,470
what you want.

48
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,370
Have you ever put yourself

49
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,240
in Ruyi's position?

50
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,510
What is your master thinking?

51
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,680
What kind of person does she need?

52
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,830
Listen.

53
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,190
She needs others to respect her.

54
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,870
She needs others to love her.

55
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,010
She needs a partner who is mentally stable.

56
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,990
She needs a man who can stand beside her.

57
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,149
Do you think you're this kind of person?

58
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,370
The story of a man who is trapped in love

59
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,190
and driven crazy by love

60
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,590
can only appear in novels.

61
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,820
If you go crazy in reality,

62
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,060
young ladies will only run away when they see you.

63
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,310
Do you like

64
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,909
sitting on Yuan Lu's thunderbombs every day?

65
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,210
Do you like it?

66
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,550
No, I don't.

67
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,670
That's right.

68
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,270
Your master doesn't like it either.

69
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,440
No one likes someone who's mentally unstable.

70
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:03,600
How is it?

71
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,230
Are you relieved now?

72
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,630
Why are you telling me this?

73
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:17,690
I'm helping you.

74
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,630
I hope you can behave like a man.

75
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,350
Don't cry like a child

76
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,560
every day.

77
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,910
You're helping me

78
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,600
because you just want to use me

79
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,670
so that I won't make trouble for your Prince Li

80
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,190
and you can save your emperor as soon as possible.

81
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:35,790
Right?

82
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,360
Of course.

83
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,610
I'm not a Bodhisattva who saves all beings.

84
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,070
Why should I give you guidance

85
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,130
and help you solve your problems?

86
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,320
Listen.

87
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,030
I'm using you.

88
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,850
I only like to make open plans.

89
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,490
Besides, I've already made myself clear in He County.

90
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,110
I can help you sit at the highest position

91
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,870
of the State of An step by step.

92
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,130
But first,

93
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,860
you must prioritize the peace in Central Plain.

94
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,510
Otherwise,

95
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,710
I won't care about the deep relationship

96
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,950
you have with your master.

97
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,910
I can find a random person

98
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,530
and also help him sit at that position step by step.

99
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,890
Think about the rest.

100
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,070
I'll keep my promise.

101
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,770
And I'll also take the opportunity

102
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,850
to ask Duke Chu to advise His Majesty

103
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,050
to release the emperor of Wu as soon as possible.

104
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,790
The Shaxi Tribe is one of the three major tribes in the State of An.

105
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,590
His words are more useful than mine.

106
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,510
But according to His Majesty,

107
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,630
it's not that easy to release him.

108
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,350
We'll also take action on this.

109
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,260
We won't sit back and do nothing.

110
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,270
The people who're guarding Yong'an Pagoda these days

111
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,600
are not my Yulin Guards

112
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,550
but Deng Hui's Scarlet Guards

113
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,020
and the Shazhong Tribe's guards.

114
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,940
I heard that they installed many traps

115
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,070
in the pagoda.

116
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:12,580
I can't help you

117
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,120
with this.

118
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,310
And that place is not the place

119
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,790
where Scarlet Guards imprisoned prisoners before.

120
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,540
Even my master

121
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,810
may not know the structure inside.

122
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,260
We'll break into the pagoda ourselves.

123
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,920
You just need

124
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,150
to help us outside.

125
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:40,830
Besides,

126
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,830
if I have a way to help you

127
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,950
eliminate First Prince,

128
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,650
are you willing to participate?

129
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,240
I'm all ears.

130
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,909
Ruyi is deeply indebted to Empress Zhaojie.

131
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,230
First Prince

132
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,950
is also the one who killed Empress Zhaojie.

133
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,340
Because he colluded with Chen Gui to harm you in He County,

134
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,050
Ruyi will definitely not spare him.

135
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,910
But now,

136
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,910
Ruyi already has a lot of injuries.

137
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,380
I don't want to see her

138
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,650
weak and unconscious again.

139
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,530
My master is injured?

140
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:20,750
It's impossible.

141
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,310
Listen to yourself.

142
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,460
She's a human, not a puppet.

143
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,740
Of course she'll get injured.

144
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,169
Then...

145
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,000
Then I'll help her.

146
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,960
I'll arrange desperate warriors for her.

147
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,070
Your master is the best assassin.

148
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,549
She doesn't need desperate warriors.

149
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,909
What you have to do now

150
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,850
is not to make her be suspected before taking action

151
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,160
and be retaliated after taking action.

152
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,020
Understood?

153
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,330
If you want to eliminate First Prince...

154
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:02,930
For example, this

155
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:06,710
is First Prince.

156
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:07,980
This

157
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,570
is you.

158
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,590
This is Ruyi.

159
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,250
And this

160
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,050
is Second Prince.

161
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,570
If we want Ruyi and you to get away with it,

162
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,590
the only thing we need to do is to deflect the blame

163
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,590
and take advantage of it.

164
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,070
Use him

165
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,110
to eliminate him.

166
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,320
You mean

167
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,250
we'll trick

168
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,910
Second Prince

169
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,350
into dealing with First Prince.

170
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,950
But Second Prince may not be fooled.

171
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,590
Although he and First Prince

172
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,110
have been competing for the position of the crown prince,

173
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,030
Second Prince is timid.

174
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,550
All these years,

175
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,040
he didn't dare to be ruthless.

176
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,020
Then let's push him.

177
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,390
Let's tell him

178
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,180
First Prince is colluding with the Scarlet Guards

179
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,550
to deal with you.

180
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,470
But he's next in line.

181
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,390
Guess how he will react after hearing this.

182
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,610
He won't sit back and do nothing.

183
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,490
But in this way,

184
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,400
Second Prince will also be in trouble.

185
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,470
Second Prince

186
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,470
is the only child of Empress Zhaojie.

187
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,600
If I do this,

188
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,520
will Master be more angry with me?

189
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,230
No, I won't.

190
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,000
Master.

191
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,590
Second Prince

192
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,350
also has Empress Zhaojie's blood on his hands.

193
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,910
For the sake of Empress Zhaojie,

194
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,340
I won't kill him.

195
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,190
But I'll make him pay the price.

196
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,040
Master.

197
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,930
But besides Second Prince,

198
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,060
there's another person who killed Empress Zhaojie.

199
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,500
Who is it?

200
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,230
The emperor of An.

201
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,760
It was him who disregarded the safety of the people

202
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,250
and betrayed Empress Zhaojie.

203
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,540
So from now on,

204
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,150
I won't call him His Majesty anymore.

205
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:24,910
Master.

206
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,910
Are you going to assassinate him?

207
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:29,510
No.

208
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,720
After all, you're still not strong enough.

209
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,070
His death will definitely lead to chaos among all the tribes

210
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:34,990
and civil strife in the State of An.

211
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,230
But I'll make him pay a price

212
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,510
which is more painful than death.

213
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,470
He'll fight against his brothers. His two sons will fight against each other.

214
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,710
His reputation will be ruined. He'll be condemned by everyone.

215
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:52,790
They'll take the opportunity to rescue the emperor of Wu at that time.

216
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,980
Then you'll gradually become stronger.

217
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:58,910
Li Tongguang.

218
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,020
Are you doing it or not?

219
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,300
What you want to do

220
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,780
is what I'm willing to do.

221
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,310
Master.

222
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,510
If I have things to discuss in the future,

223
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,720
will you still be willing to see me?

224
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,670
Don't worry. I'll definitely take care of it.

225
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,090
Wait for the good news.

226
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:50,850
Wait.

227
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,580
Apply the medicine to your neck.

228
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,140
If anyone asks,

229
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,980
just say that Scarlet Guards tried to assassinate you again.

230
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:02,910
Thank you, Master.

231
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,340
Don't you think

232
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,570
if we go back to Siyi Pavilion together,

233
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,610
it'll be very eye-catching?

234
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,190
Ning.

235
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,550
We're going first. You two bring up the rear.

236
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:36,970
Let's go.

237
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,590
It's just you and me now.

238
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,980
Are we going back on foot or by horse?

239
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,890
Let's go back later than them.

240
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,480
Okay?

241
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:54,470
Okay.

242
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,500
By the way,

243
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,430
I suddenly remembered

244
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,450
that when I came here many years ago,

245
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,730
I hid a treasure.

246
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,310
I don't know

247
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,430
if someone has taken it away.

248
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,860
What treasure?

249
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,220
Wait for me.

250
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,550
This is the treasure I mentioned.

251
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,710
Guess what it is first.

252
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:39,710
I don't know.

253
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,640
This is the best work

254
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,710
I've ever done in my life.

255
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:49,750
Let me take a look.

256
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,670
It's really a treasure.

257
00:14:59,050 --> 00:14:59,890
Why is it so light?

258
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,420
It's made of wood inside.

259
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,550
There's a layer of gold outside.

260
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,560
Why did you do this?

261
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,610
I made this

262
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,790
when I came here many years ago.

263
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,230
At that time,

264
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,190
I was still a commandant in the Hell Path.

265
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,510
I still remember

266
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,900
that we experienced an attack from the Scarlet Guards.

267
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,460
We were badly injured.

268
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,940
I almost died.

269
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,670
So since then, I've been thinking

270
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,510
that if one day

271
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,780
I die quietly

272
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,830
when performing a mission,

273
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,860
will there be no trace

274
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,800
of my existence in this world?

275
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,510
So I made this.

276
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,570
I hope one day someone can dig it

277
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,720
and find it.

278
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,590
After he finds it,

279
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,470
he'll go to a shop and exchange it for money.

280
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,350
But when he goes there, he'll know that it's fake.

281
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,390
He'll definitely wonder

282
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,630
who did this.

283
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,750
Who would do such a thing?

284
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,510
In that case,

285
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:28,950
at least one person

286
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,430
in this world will remember me.

287
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,070
He'll always remember me.

288
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,450
I also

289
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,590
had this thought before.

290
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,310
You also thought about it before?

291
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,110
So you know me.

292
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,370
We're both cruel,

293
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,230
childish,

294
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:53,750
and

295
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,270
immoral.

296
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,100
Yes, we're immoral.

297
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,500
But I

298
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,550
don't need this anymore.

299
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,430
Now I have those friends in the Liudao Hall.

300
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,510
I have you.

301
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,990
Even if I die one day,

302
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,670
they'll also remember me.

303
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,680
Of course.

304
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,860
We'll also remember you.

305
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:49,660
By the way,

306
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:54,860
when Li Tongguang was leaving today,

307
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,510
the way you looked at him...

308
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,170
Were you jealous again?

309
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:01,560
No.

310
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:05,230
In my eyes, he's just a kid.

311
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,410
I regard him

312
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,110
as a rebellious son.

313
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,590
Liar.

314
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,950
I'm serious.

315
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,150
But to be honest,

316
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,750
I'm kind of envious of him.

317
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,940
Every time I see him, I feel

318
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,590
it's great to be young.

319
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,750
Sometimes, he's

320
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,380
a powerful official.

321
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,350
Sometimes,

322
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,030
he's a boy who dares to love and hate people.

323
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,960
And as long as you give him a smile,

324
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,670
he'll immediately turn from crazy to calm.

325
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,430
So although he came here and caused trouble

326
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,630
many times,

327
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,150
I still can't hate him.

328
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:00,270
Actually, it's not just him.

329
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,220
Everyone has several sides.

330
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,110
So does Empress Zhaojie.

331
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,480
There are some things

332
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:13,290
that I just figured out today.

333
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,430
Actually, Empress Zhaojie

334
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,670
was not as perfect as I thought.

335
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,430
The emperor of An was her husband who she chose herself.

336
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,510
Second Prince

337
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:27,470
was her son who she raised herself until he was 14 years old.

338
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,220
But at the last moment of her life, she finally realized

339
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,710
that she was deceived and betrayed

340
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:35,790
by the ones she loved.

341
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,970
So in her last words,

342
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,380
she didn't mention the emperor of An and Second Prince.

343
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,830
She only told me not to avenge her death

344
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,750
and fall in love with men easily.

345
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,430
She told me to have a child who won't betray me.

346
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,330
Even though they were her last words,

347
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,740
she still pinned her hopes

348
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,350
on obedient children.

349
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,030
She never thought

350
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,510
that I can live my life

351
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,670
without relying on anyone.

352
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,520
If that's the case,

353
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,270
then why should I

354
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,670
still take Empress Zhaojie's last words as my guide?

355
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,420
I won't just live happily

356
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,990
as she expected.

357
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,430
I'll also

358
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,670
do whatever I want.

359
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:36,100
Besides the tile of No.1 assassin in the Scarlet Guards,

360
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,910
I need to find other significance of my existence

361
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,870
in this world.

362
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,890
Me, for example.

363
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,830
I want to ride a white horse with a silver saddle.

364
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,830
I want to gallop down the street like a shooting star.

365
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,610
I want to run, laugh,

366
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,120
and fly.

367
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,110
I want to fly to wherever I want to go.

368
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:26,750
Marquis.

369
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,620
I haven't seen you since you left the court this morning.

370
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,510
You're here.

371
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,710
What's the matter?

372
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,390
Marquis, you have a poor appetite these days.

373
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,090
The new cook in our mansion

374
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,230
makes camel hoof soup very well.

375
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:37,990
Please have a taste.

376
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,350
When did you change the cook?

377
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,500
I found him from Mingyue Inn two days ago.

378
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,070
What's wrong with you?

379
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,310
It's fine.

380
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,870
Just be careful from now on.

381
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:54,840
Get up.

382
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,160
Not bad.

383
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,990
Award some money to the cook later.

384
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,390
I'm going out.

385
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,350
Don't follow me.

386
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,500
Pouches. Take a look at the pouches.

387
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,310
Take a look.

388
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,060
Sir, come and take a look at my pouches.

389
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,110
Sir, you have good taste.

390
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,870
This one has the meaning of good luck.

391
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,350
And this.

392
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,950
This one represents good luck and happiness.

393
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,780
How much does the one which represents good luck and happiness cost?

394
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,800
Two coins.

395
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,620
Okay. Come again.

396
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,270
Flowers for sale!

397
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,870
Fresh roses.

398
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:55,950
Flowers for sale!

399
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,110
Fresh roses.

400
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,990
I want this one.

401
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,640
Take care.

402
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,470
Sir, do you want some flowers?

403
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,350
We picked them this morning.

404
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,350
They're very fresh.

405
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:19,630
How much is it?

406
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:20,720
One coin.

407
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,910
Thank you, sir.

408
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,750
I said it's mine. Give it back to me.

409
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,480
Be careful.

410
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,910
Darling. Darling, are you okay?

411
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,900
Even though you're from Mansion of Duke Chu, so what?

412
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,530
Can the princess hit people at will?

413
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,850
Listen.

414
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,550
My father is an imperial censor.

415
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,630
When did I hit you?

416
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,910
This man wanted to grab the hairpin.

417
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,120
Princess avoided him.

418
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,350
Then he fell down.

419
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,310
Yes, we saw it.

420
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,070
Yes.

421
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,480
Even so,

422
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,490
according to the rules of jewelry stores, first come, first served.

423
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,950
My husband already had it in his hand.

424
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,420
Why did you grab it by force?

425
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,040
Manager.

426
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:03,600
Here.

427
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:05,630
Right.

428
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,660
This purple jade hairpin

429
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,870
is made of the jade which was sent by Princess ten days ago.

430
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,590
She asked us to make it.

431
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,980
Princess is here to pick the finished product up.

432
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:17,110
But when the servant brought her the hairpin,

433
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,190
it attracted this man.

434
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,060
Understood?

435
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,190
Hairpins are always

436
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,490
given to young ladies by their husbands.

437
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,910
Some women are like men.

438
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:31,950
No wonder

439
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,000
she can only buy hairpins herself.

440
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,810
That's right. Look.

441
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,840
Watch your mouth.

442
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,030
Am I talking about you?

443
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,630
What's the hurry?

444
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,740
I only know that someone

445
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,030
is engaged,

446
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,430
but her fiancé

447
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,830
doesn't even want to talk to her.

448
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,580
On the contrary,

449
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,660
he hurriedly left the capital

450
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,590
when he heard about the engagement.

451
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,350
You don't know

452
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,750
that he avoids her

453
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,320
like a scorpion.

454
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,190
Nonsense!

455
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,530
Little Marquis.

456
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,630
Why does it take you so long to get things?

457
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,680
How long do I have to wait for you outside?

458
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,780
I said I don't know anything about gold and jade.

459
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,340
I only know this.

460
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,260
I'm glad you like it.

461
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,510
If you don't like it,

462
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:48,910
just throw it away.

463
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,600
Little Marquis is so romantic.

464
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,190
He's such a sweet husband.

465
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,190
Right.

466
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,620
He is avoiding her?

467
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,380
The young couple are having a quarrel, right?

468
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,270
He came to her

469
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,990
and said, 'If you don't like it, just throw it away.'

470
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,380
It turns out that Marquis Changqing is also bossy

471
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,630
when he pleases people.

472
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,330
Right.

473
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,240
Stop!

474
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,210
Don't use your whip arbitrarily.

475
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,270
This is not a place for you to train calvary slaves.

476
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,470
Provoking censors

477
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,270
won't do the Shaxi Tribe any good.

478
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:35,020
Thank you

479
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:36,720
for what you did inside before.

480
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,430
Also,

481
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,430
it was my fault last time.

482
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:47,670
I'm too...

483
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,150
I'm too quick-tempered.

484
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:50,750
I said some unpleasant things.

485
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,110
If I always minded what you've done,

486
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,660
you wouldn't have had the chance to stand in front of me.

487
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,590
But why did you

488
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,030
help me just now?

489
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,630
Because I'm in a good mood.

490
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,710
Really?

491
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,870
Besides, the Shaxi Tribe and I

492
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,860
are supporting each other now.

493
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:20,880
I believe

494
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,670
that as long as we find a right way to treat each other,

495
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:27,230
we'll get along in the future.

496
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:38,190
It turns out that Marquis Changqing has such a beautiful smile.

497
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,030
Get along?

498
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:45,940
Princess.

499
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,350
Princess.

500
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,250
Princess.

501
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,840
It doesn't match my riding habit at all.

502
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,070
If Duke knows what happened just now,

503
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,270
he'll be relieved.

504
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,550
He doesn't say it,

505
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,630
but he's always worried about the relationship between Marquis Changqing and you.

506
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:07,750
Shut up.

507
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:08,750
Let's go.

508
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:30,970
[On the evening of the 16th, there is a banquet at the home of General Zhenwu. First Prince's father-in-law Duke Wang was invited to the banquet.]

509
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,330
[First Prince's father-in-law, Duke Wang]

510
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,020
Lord.

511
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,470
This is our Xisai's Jade Spring Stone.

512
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:27,670
Please have a taste.

513
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,590
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

514
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,740
It's really different.

515
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,350
Bravo!

516
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,950
The Jade Spring Stone has a unique taste.

517
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:12,330
[At noon on the 17th, Duke Wang died in his mansion.]

518
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,410
The golden sawdust has always been used to kill people.

519
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,110
The other guests who drank the Jade Spring Stone are all fine.

520
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,270
They obviously targeted my father.

521
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,300
[Viscount Wang]

522
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,550
It's Zhenye.

523
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,810
Brother is the only one who could kill my father-in-law.

524
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:23,510
Don't talk nonsense if you have no evidence.

525
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:26,150
Have you really arranged the dragon robe?

526
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,400
I arranged it myself.

527
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,630
Nothing will go wrong.

528
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,110
Zhenye also wants to rebel.

529
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,990
I've found the evidence.

530
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,500
Are these the dragon robes Brother mentioned?

531
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,830
Thanks to your warning,

532
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:43,590
I was able to replace their false evidence in time.

533
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,430
Shouji wants to kill Zhenye.

534
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:47,840
Zhenye set up another trap

535
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,370
to make Shouji walk into it.

536
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,510
Do they think I'm blind?

537
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:58,210
[On the 25th, the emperor of An was so furious that he gave the order to demote First Prince.]

538
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,590
The eldest prince, Prince Hedong, Li Shouji,

539
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:57,870
resigned and decided

540
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,070
to return to the Shazhong Tribe to recuperate.

541
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,990
I was very worried when I heard that.

542
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,830
I sighed again and again, but I had to agree.

543
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,640
Due to the battle between the two states,

544
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,790
Tianmenguan has been severely damaged.

545
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,900
This place is an important defense against Beipan.

546
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,510
Considering the treaty between the three states,

547
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,720
I specially ordered the second prince, Prince Luoxi, Li Zhenye,

548
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,580
to go on patrol, supervise the construction,

549
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,860
and investigate the movements of Beipan on my behalf.

550
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,840
Yes, Father.

551
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,140
Marquis Changqing.

552
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:43,230
The situation in the court today was caused by you, right?

553
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,830
I read His Majesty's mind and spoke to him.

554
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,950
I asked His Majesty to send Second Prince to inspect Tianmenguan.

555
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,220
In this way,

556
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,840
first, he can use the treaty between the three states

557
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,920
to silence the State of Chu and the State of Wu.

558
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,190
Second,

559
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:00,400
it can also guard against the invasion from Beipan.

560
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,190
Third,

561
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:03,230
he can also use his attitudes towards the two princes this time

562
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:06,030
to make the officials who always urge him to appoint a crown prince

563
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:06,870
shut up.

564
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,680
This is called killing three birds with one stone.

565
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,180
You're very scheming.

566
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,230
I'm flattered.

567
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,050
But judging by your strategies,

568
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,090
I think

569
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,950
you would never want your beloved daughter

570
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:25,110
to just be the wife of a marquis in the future.

571
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,240
Then what position

572
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:36,000
do you want in the end?

573
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,430
Noble Consort intends to raise Third Prince.

574
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,190
But the empress dowager and regent

575
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,810
needs a minister.

576
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,280
In my body,

577
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,980
there's blood of the imperial family.

578
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,790
But I hate war.

579
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:55,800
If I can take power,

580
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:58,150
I'll definitely bring peace to the State of An.

581
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,790
Are your wings

582
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,090
worthy of your vision?

583
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,060
Please wait patiently.

584
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,970
I believe that it won't be long

585
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:15,130
before I prove myself to you.

586
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:24,370
[On the evening of the 28th, First Prince was demoted to the Shazhong Tribe. He was accompanied by Viscount Wang.]

587
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:28,890
Stop.

588
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:30,220
Stop!

589
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,040
You became like this after leaving the capital.

590
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,500
If you don't want to go to the Shazhong Tribe with me,

591
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,560
turn around

592
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,690
and accompany your woman.

593
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,750
I won't go back.

594
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,030
I'm just sad for my father

595
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:02,590
and you.

596
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,030
How did things become like this?

597
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,030
Zhenye is evil.

598
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:11,219
I just fell into a gutter.

599
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,610
Fortunately, Father knows it clearly.

600
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,760
That's why he still keeps my title.

601
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:18,300
After I lay low for a while,

602
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:21,469
I'll definitely

603
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,030
come...

604
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:27,510
Protect His Highness! Protect His Highness!

605
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,790
Kill!

606
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,110
His Highness should be satisfied now.

607
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:13,750
His Highness?

608
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,320
Who are you?

609
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:40,520
You work for Zhenye?

610
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:43,820
He's crazy.

611
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,110
You can't be crazy.

612
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,480
Do you know how serious the crime is

613
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,370
if you assassinate princes?

614
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:53,510
What about forcing Empress to die and bringing chaos to the state?

615
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,980
They're your good father-in-law Duke Wang

616
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,870
and the former Deputy Minister of Personnel Tao Wei.

617
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:06,850
Don't you know them?

618
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,590
Tao Wei?

619
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:14,270
It was him who colluded with your father-in-law to frame Empress Zhaojie.

620
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,960
And he, Duke Wang, and you

621
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,180
all acquiesced in the emperor of An's collusion with Beipan

622
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,560
to cause trouble for the people.

623
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,620
No.

624
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,600
Who are you?

625
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,360
What do you want?

626
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,310
I'm Ren Xin.

627
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:36,750
It's you.

628
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,730
You didn't die?

629
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:42,230
You did all these things?

630
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:47,790
No.

631
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,420
You can't kill me.

632
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,140
I just wanted to dethrone her at that time.

633
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:54,980
I didn't mean to kill her.

634
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,140
I know you want to avenge Empress Zhaojie's death.

635
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,830
Go to Father.

636
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,910
Father allowed these things to happen.

637
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:02,780
Close your eyes.

638
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:03,750
No.

639
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,890
I'm begging you. Don't kill me.

640
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,340
Those who bring chaos to the state should die.

641
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,390
It's a tiger head.

642
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,200
It's the Shadong Tribe's tiger head.

643
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,050
It's a tiger head. It's the Shadong Tribe's tiger head.

644
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,800
People from the Shadong Tribe killed His Highness.

645
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:46,190
They killed His Highness!

646
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,360
They killed His Highness!

647
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,320
Move!

648
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:28,200
Go!

649
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,650
You!

650
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,540
Stop! Come here!

651
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,020
Go!

652
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,980
Go!

653
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:36,830
Go!

654
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:37,650
Stop! Come here!

655
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,170
You! Stop!

656
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,700
I don't care about Tao Wei.

657
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:57,080
I just want to know who killed my son.

658
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,950
My son is dead.

659
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,340
Why should I keep you?

660
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,540
Why should I keep you?

661
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:15,150
I think

662
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:17,630
Second Prince and Chu people are the most suspicious.

663
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:20,550
The former used a method named Reverse Boots

664
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,550
to get away with obvious holes.

665
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,910
After all, the place where the incident occurred

666
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,630
had a tiger-head symbol of the Shadong Tribe where Second Prince belongs.

667
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:27,980
After First Prince died,

668
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,560
Second Prince has a better chance of becoming the crown prince.

669
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:31,940
The latter

670
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,470
might be Chu people's revenge

671
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,090
on the attack you launched.

672
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,500
As for Wu people,

673
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:41,190
their emperor is still locked up in Yong'an Pagoda.

674
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:43,550
I don't think they have the guts.

675
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,940
Good.

676
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,520
Making his brother go away didn't satisfy him.

677
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,170
He still wanted to eliminate his brother?

678
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,840
I'm not old yet.

679
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,280
He's not the only prince I have.

680
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,860
He's going to rebel

681
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,590
and continue to deal with me.

682
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,070
Investigate it.

683
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,440
Ask that beast to pack his things

684
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,570
and go to Tianmenguan immediately.

685
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,340
Yes.

686
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,240
Wait.

687
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,910
Go and tell Prince Li

688
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:36,560
to ask the State of Wu to add 30,000 taels of gold.

689
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,870
Otherwise, I won't let their emperor go.

690
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,340
My son is dead.

691
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,680
How could he live such a good life?

692
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,090
Yes, Your Majesty.

693
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,440
Go.
