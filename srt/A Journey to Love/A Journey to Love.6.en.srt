[Episode 6]

4
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,550
Wake up.

5
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:52,880
Wake up.

6
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,229
Buddy.

7
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,490
Wake up.

8
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,690
Yuan Lu, wake up.

9
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,960
Yu. Yu.

10
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:05,870
Shisan.

11
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,289
Miss. Miss.

12
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:11,180
Mr. Du.

13
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,310
Mr. Du.

14
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:12,910
Mr. Du.

15
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,200
There's no water left.

16
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:16,870
No.

17
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,010
Mr. Du.

18
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:24,310
Mr. Du.

19
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,150
Careful. Careful.

20
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:27,750
Lang.

21
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:28,900
Who…

22
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,510
Who drugged our food?

23
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,310
Your Highness.

24
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,280
Where is Her Highness?

25
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,230
She's not dead.

26
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:46,610
Are you relieved now?

27
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,030
When can you get the antidote?

28
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,530
We shouldn't talk about that in front of her.

29
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,490
I'm afraid you wouldn't talk about it either when we're outside.

30
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,500
What are you doing?

31
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,490
Don't worry.

32
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,750
It's just incense that can make her sleep like a log.

33
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,630
Can you tell me now?

34
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,130
One of the things you just said

35
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,750
was right.

36
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,480
Apart from assassination,

37
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,840
you're indeed quite naive

38
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,290
when it comes to other things.

39
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,610
Sorry.

40
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,910
We made a deal,

41
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,170
but I'm backing out of it.

42
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,680
Ning Yuanzhou.

43
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,180
You want to break your word?

44
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,430
Stop!

45
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,350
You have no internal force now.

46
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,029
You can't beat me.

47
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,360
Really?

48
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,980
The pain the heart-to-heart butterfly pill can inflict

49
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,320
is unendurable.

50
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,770
If you beg me,

51
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,650
I'll spare you.

52
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,970
How could you, Qian Zhao?

53
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,530
You actually took advantage of me

54
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,210
when I was dizzy.

55
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,810
What a humiliation.

56
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,110
Don't do that again.

57
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,070
Otherwise, we can't be friends anymore.

58
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,910
Why do you refuse to have a baby with me?

59
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:17,790
Tell me!

60
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:19,340
Let go of me.

61
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,290
I'll go check it out.

62
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,280
Ren Ruyi.

63
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,300
Why do you refuse to have a baby with me?

64
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,360
We had a deal!

65
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,190
Let go of me!

66
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,670
Help me!

67
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,960
Yu Shisan!

68
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,120
How can I help with that?

69
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:37,000
Get lost!

70
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,030
Let him go. Take me instead.

71
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,330
You can't avoid me forever.

72
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,140
As long as the heart-to-heart butterfly pill is still in your body,

73
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:55,690
I can make you

74
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,350
wish you were dead

75
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,300
whenever I want.

76
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:07,700
Can you?

77
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,600
You're not the only one who's been to Wulingman.

78
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,640
It takes a little wine to kill it completely.

79
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,930
Sorry. We're men.

80
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,710
Don't get him wrong.

81
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,710
I taught him that.

82
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,960
I was once pestered by two young ladies

83
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,190
who were obsessed with me.

84
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:18,870
You know.

85
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:21,590
Alright.

86
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,180
Put it down.

87
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:26,850
Don't worry.

88
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,930
Miss Ruyi is smarter than you.

89
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,350
She knows there's no use to keep pestering me

90
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,470
and won't lose her temper again.

91
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,300
You'll regret it.

92
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,300
What happened?

93
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:56,590
Don't you trust me?

94
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,280
I'm good at keeping secrets.

95
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,450
Didn't you hear it all outside?

96
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,380
She thought I was good-looking

97
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,790
and tried to make out with me.

98
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,350
But you refused her?

99
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,990
Ning Yuanzhou, are you a man or not?

100
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:11,490
She…

101
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,700
She'll be your kid's mother.

102
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,850
What happened?

103
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:19,790
Boss.

104
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:20,980
-Boss.
-Boss.

105
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,180
Don't worry.

106
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,020
Her Highness was just scared.

107
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,330
It's been a tough day for you.

108
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,450
We won't set off tomorrow.

109
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,400
Let's rest for another day.

110
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,650
Go back and rest.

111
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:32,980
-Yes.
-Yes.

112
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,460
Was it really Her Highness who drugged our food?

113
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,030
Why did she do that?

114
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,260
Doesn't Her Highness want to get His Majesty back?

115
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:58,570
Mr. Du.

116
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,580
Great missions can't be easily achieved.

117
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,430
If everything went smoothly, our plan would be doomed to failure.

118
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,550
Stop worrying.

119
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,210
You must be tired.

120
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,400
Go back and rest.

121
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:09,830
Qian.

122
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,350
Give Mr. Du some calming decoction.

123
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,010
Okay.

124
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,330
Mr. Du.

125
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:15,140
Let's go.

126
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:22,780
Boss.

127
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,020
Is Her Highness really unwilling to go to the State of An?

128
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,190
She's just a little scared.

129
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,660
But thinking back now,

130
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,870
weren't you terrified too

131
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,750
when you first went on a mission with me?

132
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,390
But this matter made me realize something.

133
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,530
The delegation and the caravan were formed in haste

134
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,710
and I haven't taken you on missions in a long time.

135
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,890
That's why your guard was down.

136
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,260
How about this?

137
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,230
From today onwards,

138
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,650
you'll pair up, go on patrol

139
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,110
every two hours,

140
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,750
and have different food from the others.

141
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,670
Yes.

142
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,340
Good night.

143
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,550
I heard a lot of noise in Her Highness's room.

144
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,530
What happened?

145
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,810
You're just a kid. Don't pry into adult stuff.

146
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:20,810
Wait.

147
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,670
I'm too tall to be a kid.

148
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,040
Ning Yuanzhou.

149
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:40,850
Wait and see.

150
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,560
My internal force is slowly coming back.

151
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,870
I'll make you pay

152
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,590
for what you did today!

153
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,030
I will

154
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,410
carry your child.

155
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:53,790
Who's it?

156
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:12,870
What are you doing here?

157
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,620
Gorgeous, I'm here for you.

158
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,290
Ning Yuanzhou

159
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,590
was such a jerk to you.

160
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:25,490
But you have to know

161
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,590
he's not the only man in the world.

162
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,020
There are many good men out there.

163
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,510
Like me.

164
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,930
I just turned 30.

165
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,990
I'm as beautiful as Adonis

166
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,200
and as intelligent as Aristotle.

167
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,200
I'm very gentle with women.

168
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,500
I'm a man of courage and dignity.

169
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,950
If you want to have a baby with a man,

170
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,740
I'm your best choice.

171
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:05,750
Get lost.

172
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,210
They say men should commit themselves to great causes

173
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,260
instead of dying for women.

174
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,100
But I'm glad to die at your hands.

175
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,550
Because that's the only way

176
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,820
to make you remember me forever.

177
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,500
Bring it on.

178
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,250
Don't be easy on me just because I'm hot.

179
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,830
I can take it.

180
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,310
Alright.

181
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,030
It's time for you to go back and take some tonics.

182
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,190
By the way,

183
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,610
he was indeed a jerk.

184
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,720
Stop! You…

185
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,340
Just now,

186
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,990
when he was in the room, I was outside the door.

187
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,030
Earlier tonight,

188
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,630
when he was in the room,

189
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,320
I was outside the door too.

190
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,360
Mr. Ning.

191
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,240
I've long decided to have a baby with you.

192
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,830
We'll live or die together.

193
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,870
You…

194
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,510
Give me a child.

195
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,510
Are so scheming.

196
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,710
Don't you have feelings for me at all?

197
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,670
Don't lie.

198
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,370
You can't avoid me forever.

199
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:44,840
Boss.

200
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,510
You're still up?

201
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:48,660
Are you on patrol?

202
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,230
Sorry that you have to stay up late.

203
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,250
It's fine.

204
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,530
We'll go check the backyard.

205
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,030
Okay.

206
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:02,950
Why is one horse missing?

207
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,390
You're right. One horse is missing.

208
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,430
Mr. Du.

209
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,270
Mr. Du.

Mr. Du.

211
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,580
You'll regret it.

212
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,970
See? You pissed her off and she left.

213
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,600
If I were her, I'd be pissed too.

214
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,120
She wasn't asking too much.

215
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,930
Great. The girl ran away.

216
00:14:59,130 --> 00:14:59,970
Who will teach Her Highness now?

217
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:00,630
Shut up.

218
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,150
We've found hoof prints.

219
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,550
She's headed to Yuzhou.

220
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,230
Judging from the dryness of the soil,

221
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,660
she left about two hours ago.

222
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,120
I see.

223
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:12,720
Boss.

224
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,740
Give me the tracker butterfly.

225
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:14,980
The tracker butterfly.

226
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,200
I'll be back by this time tomorrow.

227
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,510
In my absence,

228
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,790
Qian Zhao will take charge of everything.

229
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,530
Okay.

230
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,870
I'll go with you.

231
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,210
It's he who's going to father a child.

232
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,290
You stay out of it.

233
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,830
And get that feather out of your hair.

234
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,740
What child?

235
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:44,830
Who's going to be a father?

236
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:45,710
It's adult stuff.

237
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:46,920
You're too young to know about it.

238
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,550
I'm an adult.

239
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:54,830
Can I know about it?

240
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,870

Get up.

Madam.

247
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,180
Madam, please spare my life.

248
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,609
Ling Long could've escaped,

249
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,599
but for you,

250
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,770
she rushed back to the branch to send the message.

251
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,690
You were her fiancé.

252
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,790
Why didn't you save her?

253

I… I…

254
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,250
Mr. Yue left me no choice.

255
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:27,470
Ling Long and I were deeply in love.

256
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,850
But Mr. Yue got a thing for me

257
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,630
and forced me to serve her.

258
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,360
You and Ling Long were deeply in love?

259
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:35,740
Yes.

260
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,170
She was the love of my life.

261
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,530
We hung out with you in a park once.

262
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,320
Don't you remember?

263
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,940
I really had no choice.

264

Madam, please spare my life.

265
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,360
Tell me who Mr. Yue is.

266
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:51,740
Then I'll spare you.

267
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,580
Okay, I'll tell you.

268
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:56,130
Mr. Yue

269
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,310
is the head of Purple Emissaries

[Lianxiang Brothel]

273
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,630
After receiving Ling Long's report

274

that we were exposed,

275
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,830
Yue Sanniang thought

276
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,710
it was a good chance to execute the HQ's order to kill those who knew too much.

277
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,910
So she immediately issued a Cinnabar Order

278
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,450
and summoned everyone back to the branch.

279
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,250
Who gave that order in the headquarters?

280
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,760
It's confidential.

281

Close your eyes.

Madam. Madam.

289
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,250
Since Ling Long was the love of your life,

290
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,260
now that she's dead,

291
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,920
you should die too.

292
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,650
How did you find me?

293
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,470

When Qian Zhao treated you,

295

I asked him to add butterfly nectar to your medicine.

296
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,190
As long as you're within a 1.5-mile radius,

297
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,430
the tracker butterfly can find you wherever you are.

298
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,080
You're so cunning.

299

You flatter me.

You've known

that Mr. Yue is Yue Sanniang.

303
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,970
Why did you ask him again?

information without being confirmed by different sources

is just nonsense.

You're a fast learner.

308
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,170
So,

309
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,350
you didn't plan to go back to the Scarlet Guards to seek justice.

310
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,040
What you wanted was revenge.

Everyone who harmed Her Majesty and Ling Long

322
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,490
has to pay the price.

323
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,900
So you've long decided

324
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,050
to come here and kill him.

325
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:30,890
Yes.

326
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,610
I know Yu's hometown is nearby.

327
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,840
I was going to do it tomorrow.

328
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:37,610
What?

329
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,690
Did you think I had walked away in anger

330
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,590
and left the princess in the lurch?

331
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,510
Don't worry.

332
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:46,970
Unlike you,

333
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,390
I'll keep my word.

334
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,090
I know you'll keep your word.

335
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:57,860
But I want to know

336

whether I'm on the list too.

After we arrive in the State of An,

338
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,180
if you go back on your word

339
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:09,080
and don't do your best to help me find out who killed Her Majesty,

340
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,270
you'll end up like him.

341
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,560
You can't beat me.

342
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,160
You can't avoid me forever.

343
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,550
The Liudao Hall has the Hell Path.

344
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,130
You should know

345
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:27,670
that killers are much more patient than most people.

346
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:28,950
Rest assured.

347
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,860
I'll keep my promise.

348
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,330
But

349
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,290
you have to promise me

350
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,200
not to leave the delegation again

351
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,940
without my permission.

352
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,700
Because every time you kill someone,

353
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,500
you'll attract the Scarlet Guards' attention.

354
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,290
That'll affect our rescue plan

355
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,470
and the delegation's safety.

356
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,250
Why should I promise that?

357
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,760
That's not part of the deal.

358
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,230
Because you want to avenge the empress

359
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,030
much more than I want to rescue

360
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,210
the emperor of Wu.

361
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,110
You need my help

362
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,520
more than I need yours.

363
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,870
Why didn't you move aside?

364
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,030
I tried,

365
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,050
but I was too slow.

366
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,910
I owe you,

367
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:23,750
so I have to

368
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,900
let you blow off some steam.

369
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,040
I blow off steam by taking lives.

370
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,470
You don't want to kill me.

371
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,790
If I died,

372
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,950
who would find out

00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,510
who murdered Empress Zhaojie for you?

374
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,200
Yes.

375
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:41,760
I don't want to kill you.

376
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,350
Your schemes and plots

377
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,470
only make me more attracted to you.

378
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,550
So,

379
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,570
you'll be my child's father.

380
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,670
No way. That's not gonna happen.

381
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,680
What if I threaten to poison the whole delegation?

382
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:07,780
Will you still refuse me?

383
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:08,890
Of course.

384
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,960
Because at that time,

385
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,720
your godmother Ouyang's life

386
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,980
will be in my hands.

387
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,480
You want to threaten me with her?

388
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,490
You can't.

389
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,670
She's just my godmother.

390
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:25,150
I don't even give a fig about my mother's life.

391
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,430
Is that so?

392
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,990
Then why are you putting your life at risk

393
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,570
to kill Lou Qingqiang and Mr. Yue?

394
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:33,850
Just to avenge

395
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,800
the White Sparrow called Ling Long who was nice to you?

396
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,630
You

397
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,630
are more soft-hearted than you think.

398
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,580
I might

399
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,050
have been a little too harsh just now.

400
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,250
No hard feelings.

401
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:18,930
Sorry.

402
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,440
What… Ren Ruyi!

403
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,160
You…

404
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,400
Mr. Ning.

405
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:31,290
What…

406
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:35,550
You're more soft-hearted than you think too.

407
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,650
Why wouldn't you be with me?

408
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,870
It doesn't hurt

409
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,800
to be with me.

410
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,350
I was once a White Sparrow.

411
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,430
I know

412
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:52,670
what kind of women men like.

413
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,690
What's your type, an exotic dancer in an Indian tavern,

414
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,970
an elegant lady

415
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,700
from a prestigious family,

416
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,430
an aloof girl with a strong mind,

417
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,630
or a hot chick with a fiery temper?

418
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:17,440
I can feed

419
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,430
all your fantasies.

420
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,800
Enough. Are you done fooling around?

421
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,550
It's time to go back.

422
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,650
To be honest,

423
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,190
as a White Sparrow,

424
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,710
you were not good at your job.

425
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,370
Yuan Lu, let me help you.

426
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:10,910
Boss Ning.

427
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:11,930
Ruyi.

428
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,590
Last night, an emissary from the court suddenly came to Shaxi Town

429
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,750
and sent for Ms. Ren for questioning.

430
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,230
But this matter needs to be kept

431
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,510
from Her Highness and Mr. Du.

432
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,430
Understand?

433
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,590
Yes.

434
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:26,780
Come with me.

435
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,440
This is what the chief of the Liudao Hall does.

436
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,350
You lie without blinking.

437
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,690
I did that for your good

438
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,650
and to keep the delegation united.

439
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,620
Let me repeat this.

440
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,860
Don't leave the delegation again

441
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,360
without my permission.

442
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,620
Otherwise, I'll call off our deal.

443
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,270
To keep my end of the deal,

444
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,690
I just need to tell the girl inside

445
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:57,910
about the State of An.

446
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,090
I'm not obliged

447
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:01,230
to deal with her poisonings and tantrums.

448
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,650
I'll deal with her.

449
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:09,630
How is Her Highness?

450
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:10,600
She's awake.

451
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,510
But no matter what I said,

452
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:13,710
she just kept silent

453
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,850
and wouldn't eat anything.

454
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:18,750
I'll go check on her.

455
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:24,940
You're back.

456
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,040
Will you reconsider my offer last night?

457
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,100
I'm really good,

458
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:33,730
no worse than him.

459
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,580
Yu Shisan.

460
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:40,010
Ruyi is a companion we must respect.

461
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,590
She's not just a random girl you can tease.

462
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,390
Did I tease her?

463
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,250
I didn't.

464
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,670
Besides, have you ever seen me

465
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:49,870
be disrespectful or tell lies

466
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,670
to a lady?

467
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,920
She never said she's interested in you,

468
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,630
so when you made passes at her, you were being flirtatious

469
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,640
and disrespectful.

470
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,550
Not to mention you did that in front of others.

471
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:05,320
Fine.

472
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,210
I was frivolous.

473
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:09,920
Miss Ruyi.

474
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:11,200
Sorry.

475
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,160
I promise

476
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,160
not to act like this again.

477
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:28,850
From now on,

478
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,740
I'll quietly

479
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,470
and wholeheartedly

480
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,010
do everything I can to win your heart.

481
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:37,810
One day,

482
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,000
you'll realize how much I care for you.

483
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,060
Don't take what Ning Yuanzhou said

484
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,780
seriously.

485
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:51,390
He's such a hypocrite.

486
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:52,850
He doesn't dare to pursue you like I do

487
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,380
so he told me off like he's the gentleman here.

488
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,220
He's just jealous.

489
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,130
I'm already used to it.

490
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:10,370
Your Highness, please have some food.

491
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,590
No.

492
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,760
Let me go back to the capital,

493
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,840
or I'll die here.

494
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,500
Your Highness, how could you say such a terrible thing?

495
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:23,550
You're Prince Li, the emperor's envoy.

496
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,720
His Majesty's life and the future of Wu

497
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,240
both depend on you.

498
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,620
I'm not Prince Li. I'm a princess!

499
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,300
I'm just a young girl who knows nothing about politics

500
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,210
or the matters of state.

501
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,440
I just want to go back and find out

502
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,010
why Brother Danyang and my sister-in-law

503
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,830
lied to me.

504
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,830
Why?

505
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,720
What are you going to do?

506
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,410
The prince can only bring his valets on this mission.

507
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,170
She's just a maid at the post house

508
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,200
and didn't know your identity.

509
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,140
You just told her who you are,

510
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,450
so she has to die.

511
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,030
You can't kill her!

512
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,440
Please spare my life, My Lord.

513
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,450
As someone in a high place,

514
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,830
you need to be careful with everything you say.

515
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:19,540
Otherwise, others will bear the consequences.

516
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,820
Your Highness, remember her.

517
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,430
She's the first person to die for you.

518
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,090
You can't do it!

519
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:28,510
I-I'm a prince.

520
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,830
I order you to let her go.

521
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,890
I don't take orders from women in the court.

522
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:34,500
You just said

523
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,130
you're a princess.

524
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,730
Don't kill her!

525
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,870
Spare her life and I'll do anything you ask.

526
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,360
Then Your Highness,

527
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,120
would you like some food now?

528
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,550
Yuanzhou.

529
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,510
Are you threatening me?

530
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:12,090
Why are you still pushing me even at this point?

531
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:14,290
Fine.

532
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,510
Kill her if you want.

533
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:19,440
At worst,

534
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,220
I'll hang myself after she dies.

535
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,140
We can keep each other company in the afterlife.

536
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:30,030
Please spare my life, My Lord.

537
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:34,640
Her Highness is so heartbroken

538
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,960
that she can't be reasoned with now.

539
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,100
Please spare my life, My Lord.

540
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:45,760
My Lord.

541
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,060
Please spare my life.

542
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,550
Ask those in the division to lock her away

543
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,780
for a few days.

544
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,080
Let's go.

545
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,200
Ying.

546
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,220
The situation is complicated.

547
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,570
You need to be strong now.

548
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,920
You guys have fooled me into a suicide mission.

549
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,990
How can I be strong?

550
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,600
You know me.

551
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:36,120
I grew up in the court.

552
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,090
Father didn't like me.

553
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,870
Mother was not around.

554
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:43,760
Except for Ms. Gu,

555
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,960
none of the maids and eunuchs in the court

556
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,400
treated me

557
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,760
like a princess.

558
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,530
I just wanted to be free.

559
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,260
I just wanted

560
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,740
to save you from penal military service.

561
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,970
So I gritted my teeth

562
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:04,070
and accepted that fief of 800 households.

563
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,150
I never expected

564
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,970
that my brother

565
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,980
and my sister-in-law…

566
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,740
She's my sister-in-law.

567
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,740
They actually praised

568
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,620
my unparalleled loyalty

569
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,350
and dutifulness

570
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:22,540
and then sent me to my death

571
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,770
to secure their throne.

572
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,700
How could they? How could they?

573
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,060
Let me talk to her.

574
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,470
Your Boss Ning

575
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,550
is bad at dealing with tears.

576
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:42,950
It's not what you think.

577
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,240
I don't want to hear it!

578
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,320
Sorry, Yuanzhou.

579
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,460
I didn't mean it.

580
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,160
I didn't mean to hit you.

581
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,450
Does it hurt?

582
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,880
You want to know why?

583
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:04,220
Come with me.

584
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,100
I'll show you the reason.

585
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,060
Her Highness's daily meals must be prepared carefully.

586
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,719
Help! I'm about to fall!

587
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,980
Ning Yuanzhou, what are you doing?

588
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,340
I'm under the order of Her Majesty and Prime Minister Zhang.

589
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:34,250
This token means their consent.

590
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:35,940
All of you, stay out of it!

591
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,260
Yes.

592
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,050
You…

593
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,440
No one can save you now.

594
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,199
I brought you up here

595
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:55,100
to show you

596
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,870
the country your family rules.

597
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,500
We're in Baisha Town now.

598
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:07,860
That place

599
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,820
is Shaxi Town.

600
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,710
Further from there

601
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:15,340
is your mother's hometown, Yuzhou.

602
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,710
Yuzhou is in that direction?

603
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,200
Yes.

604
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,310
Yuzhou is 140 square miles

605
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,670
with a population of 14,500.

606
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,580
It's a fertile land

607
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:34,950
with rivers flowing across it.

608
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,140
Do you know

609
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,310
how many cities like that

610
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,030
did the State of Wu have?

611
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,600
38 in total.

612
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,110
However,

613
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,410
because of your conceited brother's

614
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,190
reckless decision to lead the army himself,

615
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,150
the State of Wu lost three cities.

616
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,910
A ruler shall bring about peace for his people.

617
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:14,600
The people shall strive to make their country prosper.

618
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,810
That's how things should work.

619
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,290
But he trusted sycophants

620
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,140
and subjected hundreds of thousands of people to the flames of war.

621
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,090
Men were killed. Families fell apart.

622
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,670
You, of all people, can't ask why this is happening.

623
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,910
But I have nothing to do with that.

624
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,630
I grew up in the court. I don't know any…

625
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,770
You're part of the Yang family,

626
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,250
so it has everything to do with you.

627
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,200
You were in the doghouse and don't know about politics,

628
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,590
but because your last name is Young,

629
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,190
you've enjoyed a luxurious life

630
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,870
that ordinary people can never afford.

631
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,090
Although you're unloved,

632
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:46,950
as a princess,

633
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,960
you receive at least 500,000 coins a year.

634
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:51,760
But you know what?

635
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,440
Those who fought alongside your brother on the battlefield

636
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,490
only got 1,000 coins

637
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,270
as compensation after they died.

638
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,800
Really?

639
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,100
The State of Wu was only established about 50 years ago.

640
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,310
Those people

641
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:17,310
haven't benefited much from your family's rule.

642
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:21,100
Yes.

643
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,130
You can be afraid of death.

644
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:25,410
You can escape.

645
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,270
But if something happens to you in the State of An,

646
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,820
none of us can live.

647
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:32,770
Yang Ying, keep this in mind.

648
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,010
Everyone in the delegation,

649
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,240
from superiors like me and Mr. Du,

650
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,730
to subordinates like the servants and stable boys,

651
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,650
is willing to risk their lives

652
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:39,550
to escort you

653
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,890
not because they're blindly loyal,

654
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,670
or because they want to get promotions,

655
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,830
but because they want to save the people of the two countries

656
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:46,850
from the flames of war,

657
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,430
and because they want to vindicate

658
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,390
their brothers from the Heaven Path who died on the battlefield

659
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,010
but were accused of treason.

660
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,060
Am I right?

661
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,190
Yes!

662
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,380
Yes!

663
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,790
You think it's unfair.

664
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,920
You want to escape back to the capital.

665
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,290
You want to ask your brother

666
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,640
what you did to deserve this.

667
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,570
But have you ever thought of

668
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,870
those people who died in the war?

669
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,140
Was it fair for them?

670
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,630
What did they do to deserve death?

671
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,330
When you drugged the delegation's food,

672
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:30,130
did it cross your mind that if you had used too much drug,

673
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,480
they all could've died at your hands?

674
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:38,920
Sorry.

675
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,080
Sorry.

676
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:42,810
Sorry.

677
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:46,870
Ying.

678
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:49,400
There's no use crying.

679
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,450
You've made your decision

680
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:52,350
and have to stick it out.

681
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:53,670
There's no turning back for you.

682
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,470
The journey to the State of An is dangerous,

683
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,500
but as long as you can be strong and dedicated

684
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,560
from today onwards,

685
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,310
I, together with everyone else in the delegation,

686
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,500
will stand with you in life and in death.

687
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,840
Really?

688
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,300
I swear on my life.

689
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:20,180
Then I swear

690
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,670
that I won't run away again.

691
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,320
I'll toughen up.

692
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,240
Good.

693
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,510
No one is above the law, not even a prince.

694
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,310
Rules must be obeyed

695
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:43,950
to maintain order in the delegation.

696
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,220
For his own interest,

697
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,010
Prince Li poisoned the food

698
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:51,940
and drugged a total of 69 people in the delegation.

699
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,150
I, Ning Yuanzhou, trusted by the country to lead the delegation,

700
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:57,170
will give him 20 lashes on the palm as punishment.

701
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:58,770
It's decided.

702
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:06,980
Can I take the lashes for His Highness?

703
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,310
You can make it 40 lashes.

704
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,270
Mr. Ning.

705
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:16,100
That's too disgraceful for His Highness.

706
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,830
When he drugged our food,

707
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:22,040
he already brought disgrace on the royal family.

708
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:23,740
Say no more, Mr. Du.

709
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,290
It's useless to beg mercy for him.

710
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:27,710
I have to do this

711
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,590
to set an example.

712
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,070
But

713
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:38,130
Mr. Du has a point.

714
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,950
It's disgraceful to punish His Highness in public.

715
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,300
I'll punish him in the room.

716
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:47,830
Remember.

717
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:51,420
If anyone here tries to undermine the delegation again,

718
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,400
you'll end up like Prince Li.

719
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:55,750
Yes.

720
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:57,110
All right.

721
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:58,820
Go get prepared.

722
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,660
We'll set off in four hours.

723
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,500
Yes.

724
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,090
Please.

725
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:20,860
Let me do it.

726
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,810
You were just trying to intimidate them.

727
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:25,660
When no one is around,

728
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,550
I don't think you can bring yourself to beat her.

729
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:49,510
Ruyi is cutting Her Highness no slack.

730
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,640
Yeah.

731
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,280
Judging by the sound, it must hurt a lot.

732
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,710
She's so cruel.

733
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,950
A cruel woman

734
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,210
is the most attractive.

735
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,440
You actually refused her.

736
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:04,520
I'll bring flowers to your grave.

737
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:13,370
I don't want to talk to you.

738
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,440
If you tell me

739
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,500
the real reason why you're willing to dress like a man

740
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:28,310
and go to the State of An,

741
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:31,620
I can save the other 10 lashes

742
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,790
for another day.

743
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:39,260
You're a princess who seldom left the court.

744
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:42,240
Why do you want freedom so much that you put everything on the line?

745
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,840
Men don't understand,

746
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,570
but I do.

747
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:51,580
Tell me.

748
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:57,170
There is

749
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,300
an Imperial Guard

750
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:02,550
whose name is Zheng Qingyun.

751
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,750
You

752
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,330
want to marry him.

753
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:08,650
Is that why you're pretending to be a man?

754
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,070
Have you ever thought

755
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:14,590
if you had escaped last night,

756
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:16,750
you'd be cooped up in the court

757
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:18,630
for the rest of your life

758
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,370
and wouldn't be able to see that guard again?

759
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:22,880
That wouldn't happen.

760
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:25,190
I just wanted to go back

761
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:26,600
to ask my sister-in-law for an explanation.

762
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:28,220
If you did,

763
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:31,970
would she admit that she'd sent you to your death?

764
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:34,220
No.

765
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:35,870
She'd only think of you

766
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:38,260
as a problem that she needs to get rid of.

767
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:39,830
Do you really think

768
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,310
you're the only prince of the State of Wu?

769
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,820
No.

770
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,260
The whole world knows

771
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:48,360
Prince Li has been sent as an envoy to the State of An.

772
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:51,500
She could've got someone to put on a skin mask

773
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,690
and go to the State of An disguised as you.

774
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:56,990
That's impossible.

775
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:19,410
Down on your knees.

776
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,690
How's that possible?

777
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:33,950
I looked like a prince more than you do, right?

778
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:39,060
I can pretend to be Prince Li,

779
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,750
but I wouldn't do that.

780
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,150
First,

781
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:46,200
I'm not from the State of Wu.

782
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:47,420
Second,

783
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:51,030
I've realized that you're braver and smarter

784
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:54,590
than I thought.

785
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,610
You kept whining and crying,

786
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:00,020
but in the meantime,

787
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,490
you managed to drug the whole delegation.

788
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:04,490
Your smartness

789
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:06,780
impressed me.

790
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:10,010
If you're willing to study hard,

791
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,800
you may become

792
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:14,930
a more powerful woman than your sister-in-law.

793
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:17,670
Really?

794
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,160
Why would I lie to you?

795
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,630
I can become as amazing as you

796
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:25,230
and my sister-in-law?

797
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,150
Yes.

798
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:28,340
When you do,

799
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:31,370
you can not only have a grand wedding with Zheng Qingyun

800
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,940
but also break everyone

801
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:37,170
who bullied you

802
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:39,180
and looked down on you.

803
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,440
♫My eyes are blazing and my armor is shimmering♫

804
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,360
♫I have feuds to settle♫

805
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:48,450
♫Who can lighten my darkness?♫

806
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:48,220
Just like this.

807
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:52,120
♫Who can see what I've been through?♫

808
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:57,980
♫Standing on the battlefield, I feel an overwhelming desire to win♫

809
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:00,110
♫This is when the tide turns♫

810
00:45:59,350 --> 00:45:59,980
Come here.

811
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,350
♫I chose this path myself♫

812
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:03,700
Do what I did.

813
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:07,010
♫There's no turning back♫

814
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,870
♫Failure is just a delusion♫

815
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:11,670
Think about all your hatred

816
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,160
♫I fall into the abyss♫

817
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:13,450
and pride.

818
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:19,030
♫Only to soar through the sky♫

819
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:16,290
Hack it without any hesitation.

820
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:23,100
♫They stab me in the back but I'll come back stronger♫

821
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:24,080
Ruyi.

822
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,570
♫My roar shakes the ground when I wield my sword♫

823
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:25,740
I made it!

824
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:26,680
I made it.

825
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:30,810
♫They say I have no future but I'll rock the world♫

826
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,600
Now tell me.

827
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:29,650
Who are you?

828
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:33,720
♫The sky is burning♫

829
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:36,680
♫There is no right or wrong♫

830
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:35,810
I

831
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,750
am Prince Li of Wu!

832
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:42,940
♫There is no right or wrong♫

833
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:47,340
Did you hear that?

834
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:51,670
Thank you.

835
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:53,350
You're more thoughtful than me.

836
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:58,570
There are things

837
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:00,670
she needs to figure out herself

838
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:02,290
before she moves on bravely.

839
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:04,670
Those are just old tricks

840
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:06,380
I used to encourage my subordinates.

841
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:07,460
Forget about them.

842
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:09,980
Send a letter back immediately

843
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:11,610
to get Zheng Qingyun under control.

844
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:14,010
At least get him to write a letter back

845
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:15,450
to reassure her.

846
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:19,380
Ren Ruyi.

847
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:23,270
I have a question for you.

848
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:26,320
What you just did

849
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:28,720
was not part of our deal.

850
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:30,460
Why did you help me?

851
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,610
Because I found you appealing

852
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:35,180
when you were on the roof.

853
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:41,450
Fine.

854
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:43,890
See it as a gesture to curry favor with you.

855
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,280
I can't force you to be with me

856
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:47,630
so I'll worm my way into your heart.

857
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,050
You have a soft heart,

858
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:51,550
so I believe if I keep helping you,

859
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:53,430
you'll be moved one day.

860
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:57,370
If that's your plan,

861
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,180
I have to tell you it won't work.

862
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:02,530
Because I'll never get attached

863
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,900
to my work partner.

864
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:15,290
Don't read into it.

865
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:18,150
I just want to have a baby with you.

866
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,730
I never said anything about attachment.

867
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:40,860
What's wrong?

868
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:44,320
Y-You and Ruyi

869
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:47,680
are going to h-have a baby?

870
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:49,270
You naughty kid,

871
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:50,410
what are you talking about?

872
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:52,370
I…

873
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:53,410
Boss.

874
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:54,550
I'm already 18.

875
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:55,910
How can you still call me a kid?

876
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:57,830
Even when you're 80, you'll still be a kid to me.

877
00:48:57,830 --> 00:48:58,290
I…

878
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:00,500
Have you been taking your pills on time?

879
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,150
So you and Ruyi are…

880
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:10,340
Don't ask.

881
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,500
Go see if the horses are ready.

882
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:13,380
We're leaving soon. Go.
