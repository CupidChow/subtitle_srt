[Episode 5]

4
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,570
Don't you work in the Scarlet Guards?

5
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,630
Why are you working as a laundress here?

6
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,440
Who are you spying on?

7
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,320
I... I used to be a White Sparrow.

8
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,790
I was lucky to follow Lord before.

9
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,710
In the fire five years ago,

10
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,479
I was also going to die.

11
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,919
Fortunately, people from the Scarlet Guards helped me.

12
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,070
I only broke a shoulder blade.

13
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,770
I really saw it.

14
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,340
Right here.

15
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,390
Don't talk.

16
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,630
Do as I say. We'll be fine.

17
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:28,940
Who is it?

18
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:33,240
I'm sorry to disturb you.

19
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,240
Go on.

20
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:35,800
Go on.

21
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,590
Tongguang is indeed a philandering marquis.

22
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,290
In broad daylight,

23
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,950
he chased a laundress

24
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,640
into a tent.

25
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,510
Tongguang.

26
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,370
When did your love affair start?

27
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,100
She's just a servant.

28
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,460
Uncle, it's because you just promoted me.

29
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,290
I was so happy.

30
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,990
Listen.

31
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,190
It's my fault?

32
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,190
That's right.

33
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,880
Do you really like her?

34
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,170
Then why didn't you kill her?

35
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:26,750
Her being alive

36
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,930
is a hidden danger to both of us.

37
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:33,930
Say something.

38
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:37,320
Not long ago,

39
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,110
an envoy from the State of Su came.

40
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,540
He wrote a poem which I like very much.

41
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,560
If you have my green skirt in mind,

42
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:47,710
be kind to green grass.

43
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,480
She looked like you when she cried.

44
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,700
For a moment,

45
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:55,320
I couldn't do it.

46
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,730
Stop lying to me.

47
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,140
I'm a living person.

48
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,160
I'm standing in front of you alive.

49
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,460
You don't even touch me.

50
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,240
Prince Hedong said

51
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,730
that he saw you and her lying on the same place.

52
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:17,190
You

53
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,550
just want to use me as a pawn, right?

54
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,420
You think I'm dirty, right?

55
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:26,950
What I despise

56
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,780
is my own ignoble bloodline.

57
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,130
Do you really want me to say it?

58
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:36,820
Yes.

59
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,490
I don't dare get too close to you.

60
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,760
Because although I feel inferior,

61
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,150
I have a big dream

62
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,580
of being the Cabinet Grand Secretary.

63
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,500
You're the brightest pearl in the Shaxi Tribe

64
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,880
and the most noble woman in the palace of An.

65
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,430
But I'm

66
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,170
just the son of a paramour.

67
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,500
If you weren't too lonely,

68
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,020
I wouldn't have the right to stand by your side.

69
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,190
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,980
I really can't do it.

71
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,460
No.

72
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,890
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,480
I won't force you anymore.

74
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,770
You just need

75
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:55,070
to lend me

76
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,470
this shoulder to lean on

77
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,290
occasionally.

78
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,080
[The State of Wu, Zhang's Teahouse]

79
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:16,610
Boss is back.

80
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,970
Boss is back.

81
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,710
Ning knows how beautiful that beauty is.

82
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,300
Beauties are the rarest.

83
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,960
Ning would rather die for beauties.

84
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,730
Even if he becomes a ghost in the next life, he's still romantic.

85
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,830
Why was the word "Ning" mentioned so many times?

86
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,540
This is

87
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:43,620
your cousin?

88
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,200
You're his cousin.

89
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,280
No wonder the word "Ning" was mentioned so many times.

90
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,290
No wonder

91
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,560
Boss Ning asked us to split up into two groups to save people.

92
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,170
Cousin, what's your name?

93
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,220
Cousin, what's your surname?

94
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,120
Her name is Ren Ruyi.

95
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,470
She's going to the State of An with us.

96
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,750
She's also responsible for teaching Her Highness.

97
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,480
This is Qian Zhao. He's a jack-of-all-trades, master of none.

98
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,470
This is...

99
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,210
He's not important.

100
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,570
I... I'm very important.

101
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:21,840
My name is Yu Shisan.

102
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,670
I know more than Qian Zhao.

103
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,280
Cousin, why do you

104
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,470
look so pale?

105
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,420
Are you not feeling well?

106
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,100
Yes. She's badly injured.

107
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:34,840
Examine her.

108
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:35,670
Okay.

109
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,800
This wound

110
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,310
seems to be caused by the Bloody Caltrops of the Scarlet Guards?

111
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,830
She's a police officer of the State of Chu.

112
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,270
She has a vendetta against the Scarlet Guards.

113
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,060
Drink it.

114
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,320
Cousin, you're really an outstanding woman.

115
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,420
I'm impressed.

116
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,180
But why doesn't Cousin talk?

117
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,750
She also hurt her throat?

118
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,250
She just doesn't want to talk to you.

119
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:25,790
No way.

120
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,170
I'm quite fun.

121
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,690
All right. Let's go.

122
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,340
If it succeeds,

123
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,670
I'll ask Yu

124
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,450
to buy you three packs of Zhang's Pastry

125
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,160
to calm your nerves.

126
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:01,940
Really?

127
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,550
You greedy cat.

128
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:13,940
Ruyi.

129
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,210
What's wrong?

130
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,380
This is very delicious.

131
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,270
Nothing.

132
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,700
I was reminded of an old friend.

133
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:22,610
Thank you.

134
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,200
Why didn't they

135
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,850
suspect my identity at all?

136
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,290
Because you were brought here by Boss Ning.

137
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,970
He also asked Qian to treat you.

138
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,360
That means they treat you as one of them.

139
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,850
You trust him so much.

140
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:40,990
If he asks us to die,

141
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,210
I won't even blink.

142
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,340
Is he really that good?

143
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,870
Of course.

144
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,900
Our Boss Ning was born in an aristocratic family of Jiangdong.

145
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,470
His mother, Gu, comes from a long line of scholars.

146
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,620
I heard that she also worked as a preceptor in the palace before.

147
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,450
Boss Ning's knowledge can definitely help him become an imperial scholar.

148
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,730
His martial art skills are the best.

149
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,930
He's smart and resourceful.

150
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,270
He's also the first person who became the Deputy Chief

151
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,120
in his 20s.

152
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,610
Isn't he good?

153
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,830
Not to mention people from the outside,

154
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,120
even our Liudao Hall

155
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,340
has hundreds of female officers

156
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,270
who want to marry him.

157
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:15,600
Really?

158
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,000
There's a sentence you must remember.

159
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,960
[Empress Zhaojie]

160
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:28,870
Don't fall in love with men easily in your life.

161
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:30,900
But

162
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,200
you must have a child of your own.

163
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,470
Cousin, you finally spoke.

164
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,940
I was so worried.

165
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,330
So you didn't hurt your throat.

166
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,060
Cousin, you have a really beautiful voice.

167
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,350
Don't call me that.

168
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,230
Don't be so heartless.

169
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,110
Today is really a wonderful day.

170
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,230
It's the first day I go side by side with you.

171
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,670
Your weakness is at the Juque acupoint.

172
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,000
Yours is at the Jingming acupoint.

173
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,350
Boss.

174
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:03,450
Boss.

175
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,050
Why did they

176
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,190
start fighting like this?

177
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,890
A wolf is new to a wolf pack.

178
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,370
Even though it's brought here by the leader of the wolf pack,

179
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,760
they have to know their positions

180
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,220
so that they'll know how to behave in the future.

181
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,650
I see.

182
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:16,750
Boss.

183
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,940
You're a wolf pack leader.

184
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,480
Ruyi ranks second.

185
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,260
Qian is old,

186
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,260
so he's an old wolf.

187
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,620
I'm young, so I'm a young wolf.

188
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,760
What about Shisan?

189
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,190
A lecherous wolf.

190
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,750
I'm not a lecherous wolf.

191
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,510
I want to be a charming wild wolf.

192
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:37,610
Your Highness.

193
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,090
This is Ren Ruyi.

194
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,350
She's the preceptor I hired for you.

195
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,340
She knows everything about the State of An.

196
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,810
From this day forward,

197
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,250
she'll be responsible for teaching you.

198
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,440
Greetings, Prince Li.

199
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,650
Rise.

200
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,160
Mr. Ning.

201
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,700
Why did you replace us

202
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,840
without consulting us?

203
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,410
Because you're incompetent.

204
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,670
You can't teach her well.

205
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:03,900
How dare you!

206
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,280
I was sent by Her Majesty.

207
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,800
I once visited the State of An

208
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,110
with Princess Xunyang.

209
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,900
Send Ms. Ming back to the capital.

210
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:17,770
Yes.

211
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,130
Hurry!

212
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:19,810
What are you doing?

213
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,290
Let go!

214
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:21,900
Mr. Ning.

215
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,140
What's going on?

216
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,040
You have no choice.

217
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,970
I'm not consulting you. I'm informing you.

218
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,060
That's right.

219
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,450
I... No.

220
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,130
I want her to be my teacher.

221
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,170
This is my order.

222
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,100
This...

223
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,140
What are you writing?

224
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,830
The names of the big shots in the State of An's court.

225
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,680
You have to memorize them later.

226
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,650
Why aren't you afraid of me?

227
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,420
You were so timid

228
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,550
and tongue-tied before.

229
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,890
Why did you

230
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,090
suddenly ask me to stay?

231
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,380
Tell me.

232
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,070
Because

233
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,520
you controlled Ms. Ming as soon as you came.

234
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,420
Ms. Ming...

235
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,290
She's very strict.

236
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:30,940
She hit you?

237
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,380
She pricked the places where other people couldn't see.

238
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,250
People from the State of Wu also do this?

239
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,340
Why didn't you tell Ning Yuanzhou?

240
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,510
I was afraid to make things difficult for Yuanzhou.

241
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,660
Besides, Ms. Ming did this

242
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,590
in order to remind me to study hard and listen attentively.

243
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,550
Yuan Lu.

244
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,160
Here.

245
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,400
Send a message to the persons who're sending Ms. Ming back.

246
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,490
Before they return to the capital,

247
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,350
prick her with the Bone Attached Needles of your Liudao Hall

248
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,850
three times a day.

249
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,050
Every day.

250
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:15,850
Yes.

251
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:19,940
Why are you crying?

252
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,890
Ruyi.

253
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,580
Yuan Lu just told me what happened.

254
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,150
Thank you.

255
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,050
I haven't seen Ying

256
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,900
for many years.

257
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:45,960
I was negligent.

258
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,280
It's normal for you to not know

259
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,050
the tricks used to torture women in the palace.

260
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,490
By the way,

261
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,730
besides the caravan,

262
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,990
many people in the delegation are from the Heaven Path.

263
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,310
They're responsible for protecting people.

264
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,370
In the delegation, you...

265
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,570
You don't ask me how I teach her?

266
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,450
There's no need to ask about it.

267
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,840
Since I chose you to teach her,

268
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,210
I don't doubt you.

269
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:08,890
Besides,

270
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,770
who else

271
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,160
knows the State of An better than Left Messenger Ren?

272
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,950
I've left the State of An for five years.

273
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,430
But haven't you been a White Sparrow for the past five years?

274
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,680
You're capable of teaching Her Highness.

275
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,430
I wasn't finished yet.

276
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,940
To avoid trouble,

277
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,120
in front of the delegation,

278
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,090
I'll tell them you're a female officer from the Liudao Hall.

279
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,100
But in front of Shisan and the others,

280
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,110
you're a police officer from the State of Chu.

281
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,010
Why don't you tell them directly

282
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,420
that I was a White Sparrow from the Scarlet Guards?

283
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,210
Because I guess in this world,

284
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,400
no woman

285
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,400
wants to be regarded as someone who trades on her look.

286
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:43,920
So do you.

287
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,600
If I had a choice,

288
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,350
I wouldn't be a White Sparrow who has to trade on my look

289
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,840
and seduce men.

290
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,390
By the way,

291
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,010
especially Qian Zhao.

292
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,850
He hates the Scarlet Guards very much.

293
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,560
Don't expose your identity.

294
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:05,310
Mr. Ning,

295
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,839
you're indeed considerate.

296
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,770
Tell me how many tribes there are in the State of An.

297
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,680
I know this.

298
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,720
There are three major tribes in the State of An.

299
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,370
The Shaxi Tribe, the Shadong Tribe,

300
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,560
and the Shazhong Tribe.

301
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,350
Which tribe is close to

302
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,530
Second Prince?

303
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,640
Is it

304
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,920
the Shaxi Tribe?

305
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,730
Which cities were occupied by the An people

306
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,290
in the Tianmenguan Battle?

307
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,030
I...

308
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,950
Starting tomorrow, I'll teach you for two more hours every day after dinner.

309
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:11,960
If you make a mistake again,

310
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,440
copy it 100 times and submit it to me.

311
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:22,760
[Zhucheng]

312
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,450
[Zhucheng, Zhucheng Inn]

313
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,490
Beauty is so heartless.

314
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,570
Her Highness is still a cute...

315
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,030
He's still a little prince who was raised by his cute mother.

316
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,130
Boss.

317
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,530
Aren't Ruyi and Her Highness getting along well?

318
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,840
Why is Her Highness crying?

319
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:51,340
A teacher offers both carrots and sticks.

320
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,730
Although Ruyi helped Her Highness punish Ms. Ming,

321
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,250
it doesn't mean she'll always be kind to Her Highness.

322
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:58,870
Let's go.

323
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:01,610
Your Highness.

324
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,470
Please drink this.

325
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:09,750
Wrong.

326
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,770
Men should drink alcohol

327
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,580
like this.

328
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,380
Keep eating.

329
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,360
I...

330
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,490
I...

331
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,180
I have a poor appetite.

332
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,450
I can't eat.

333
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,790
Then go to the backyard and do the horse stance for an hour.

334
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:39,430
Okay.

335
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,330
Do you think I'm too cruel to her?

336
00:19:59,260 --> 00:19:59,900
No.

337
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,870
Being cruel to her now

338
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,760
is better than letting the An people be cruel to her

339
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,900
when she arrives in the State of An.

340
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,090
Besides...

341
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:09,770
Forget it.

342
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:11,940
Make it clear.

343
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,280
Besides, I believe

344
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,360
that you must have suffered more than her

345
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:17,930
and been injured more seriously.

346
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,020
But time is limited.

347
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,370
If she can learn 10% of what you have,

348
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,860
I'll be satisfied.

349
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,670
You suddenly treat me so well.

350
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,040
I'm really not used to it.

351
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,680
The past is the past.

352
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,660
Now we're working together.

353
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,720
Of course I treat you differently.

354
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:42,860
Really?

355
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,410
There's no one else here anyway.

356
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,590
Why don't we sit down,

357
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,030
have a drink together,

358
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,290
and talk about

359
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,070
how we can work together?

360
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:57,850
I have an old injury.

361
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:58,720
I can't drink cold alcohol.

362
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,050
I'll go and warm it

363
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,270
for you.

364
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,600
Ruyi.

365
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,140
Don't you want to know why I asked you to do the horse stance?

366
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,610
I don't know.

367
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:14,850
But whatever you do is for my own good.

368
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,190
I'll do it again.

369
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,100
Take a break before continuing.

370
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:21,590
Okay.

371
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,020
Why are you so obedient?

372
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,270
Because I liked you

373
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,320
when I first saw you.

374
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,150
I'm obedient to you.

375
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:35,750
No.

376
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,790
You're a princess.

377
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,140
Ms. Ming treated you badly,

378
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,680
but you were also obedient to her.

379
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,450
It only shows one thing.

380
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,060
You are used to obeying others

381
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,180
and dare not defy others.

382
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:54,040
My mother and ladies-in-waiting taught me that.

383
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,370
They said that women should be demure and docile.

384
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,250
I'm a princess. There're more reasons for me to be like this.

385
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:02,280
Otherwise, I won't be able to get married for the rest of my life.

386
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,950
Who said women must get married?

387
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,120
You are a princess.

388
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,790
You can be alone and free forever.

389
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,980
But if I don't get married,

390
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,560
who will take care of me,

391
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:16,750
talk with me, and laugh with me?

392
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,510
How can I have a baby?

393
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,090
What's so good about getting married?

394
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,060
Don't become anyone's wife.

395
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,870
Otherwise, your fate will be in other people's hands.

396
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,250
Even without getting married,

397
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,480
women can also have their own children.

398
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,770
But they all said

399
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,640
I... I need to find a good husband.

400
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,880
This is the most important thing in my life.

401
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:40,610
They lied to you.

402
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,290
No.

403
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,270
Other people may lie to me,

404
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:44,950
but my sister-in-law would never lie to me.

405
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,430
She told me the same.

406
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:47,470
Really?

407
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,400
Do you know

408
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,010
Empress Xiao

409
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,750
has always wanted you dead?

410
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,330
Don't spread such a rumor about my sister-in-law.

411
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:58,510
She treats me so well.

412
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,880
She treats you well?

413
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:04,080
She knows you are a princess with many weaknesses.

414
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,740
But she still asked you to disguise as a man to come to the State of An.

415
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,340
Do you really think the officials in the State of An are so blind

416
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,360
that they can't notice you don't even have an Adam's apple?

417
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:15,310
She only sent a chief clerk who is tough outwardly and timid inwardly

418
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,350
and an arrogant and domineering female official who is incompetent.

419
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,640
I... I...

420
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,880
It was urgent, and I was entrusted with the mission at a critical moment.

421
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:24,270
When you see Yama,

422
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,800
you can tell him.

423
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,770
Let me tell you the truth.

424
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,550
Prince Danyang doesn't want your brother to return safely at all.

425
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,810
He desires to see

426
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:38,840
your brother's corpse now.

427
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:39,810
In this way,

428
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,690
he can be the emperor naturally.

429
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,530
The empress doesn't want to save your brother that much either.

430
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,650
She just wants to wait a few more months.

431
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,410
When the baby is born,

432
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,410
she can make your brother Grand Emperor.

433
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:52,950
No.

434
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,250
And she can be a regent in the name of the empress dowager.

435
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,510
As for you and your brother,

436
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,190
it's best that you are locked up

437
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,700
in the dark prison in the State of An.

438
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,590
In a few years, you will die of illness.

439
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:05,900
This

440
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,960
is what a happy ending is.

441
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:08,920
You are lying.

442
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:09,920
If you don't believe me,

443
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:11,930
you can ask him.

444
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,350
Yuanzhou.

445
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,820
You shouldn't have told her this.

446
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,070
I just want her to wake up sooner.

447
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,760
At least

448
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,420
she can know why when she dies.

449
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:33,590
Yang Ying,

450
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,180
listen.

451
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,350
If you don't change

452
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,080
your weak and sentimental personality immediately,

453
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,410
you will die, really.

454
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,000
Eat as much as you can

455
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,160
to strengthen your health

456
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,850
and study hard.

457
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,800
It is your only way to live.

458
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,540
Yuanzhou,

459
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,500
is what she said true?

460
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,300
How many sons does the emperor of the State of An have?

461
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:53,630
3.

462
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,180
The eldest son

463
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,210
is Prince Hedong, Li Shouji.

464
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:58,610
The second son

465
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,480
is Prince Luoxi, Li Zhenye.

466
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,050
And the third son is Li Chengyuan.

467
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,770
You've improved a lot.

468
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,010
Desperate times call for desperate measures. It's really effective.

469
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,860
[Baisha Posthouse, Baisha Town]

470
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,910
Hurry. Move faster.

471
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,230
Be careful.

472
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,210
Be careful.

473
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,340
Has the food been prepared?

474
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,840
My Lord, rest assured. It's ready.

475
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:27,550
This way, please.

476
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,150
I'm so hungry, Shisan.

477
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,040
How long will it still take to arrive at the border?

478
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,010
It will take long.

479
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,370
We need to arrive in Lingzhou first.

480
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:34,300
Then we need to arrive in Jiangcheng.

481
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,760
And we also need to pass by many prefectures and counties.

482
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:36,880
Consider it a chance to lose weight.

483
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,720
What are you looking at?

484
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:47,080
The beauty and the carriage shine and echo each other.

485
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,170
Cut the crap.

486
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,140
Boss, I'm hungry.

487
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:57,010
We'll eat as soon as we settle down.

488
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:58,190
Let's go.

489
00:27:59,110 --> 00:27:59,900
What's wrong, Your Highness?

490
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:03,330
I'm fine.

491
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,520
Where is the restroom?

492
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,550
Your Highness, this way.

493
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,450
Ruyi,

494
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,700
what should I do? I think I suddenly...

495
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:14,700
have my period.

496
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:18,210
Have your servants

497
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,170
never prepared anything for you?

498
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,120
We came out in a hurry this time.

499
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,620
I think we passed by a town just now.

500
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,210
Can you go there

501
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,810
and help me see if there's anything useful?

502
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,680
Please.

503
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:38,630
They are all men.

504
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,370
Thank you, Ruyi.

505
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,210
Give me a horse.

506
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,410
Okay.

507
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,330
Your Highness, this way.

508
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:03,470
I'll go by myself. I don't need you.

509
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,120
-Yes.
-Yes.

510
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:21,590
Your Highness.

511
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:26,470
Your Highness.

512
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,740
Go get some water.

513
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:32,610
I want to clean my hands.

514
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:34,770
Please wait a moment, Your Highness.

515
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:53,880
Your Highness.

516
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,030
Your Highness, what's wrong?

517
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,150
I'm not feeling well.

518
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,710
You eat first.

519
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:17,600
Mr. Du.

520
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,490
I'm gonna go check on her.

521
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,190
Who is it?

522
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,210
It's me.

523
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:32,350
Are you alright, Ying?

524
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,200
Yuanzhou.

525
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,680
My stomach hurts.

526
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:38,900
Wait for me.

527
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:39,730
I'm going to ask Qian Zhao here.

528
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,480
No need.

529
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:42,170
I...

530
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:45,320
I'm not sick.

531
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:48,930
Ruyi went out to find something for me.

532
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,120
Just give me the warm honey water

533
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,210
over there.

534
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,220
Yuanzhou,

535
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,930
try it for me.

536
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,530
See if it's hot.

537
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,200
The warm honey water...

538
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,700
This is my first time drinking it. Does it have to be this sweet?

539
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,470
It is this sweet.

540
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,620
Here, have some.

541
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,470
It's still hot.

542
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,210
Put it on the table.

543
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:45,580
I'll drink it after I get some sleep.

544
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,400
If you feel too uncomfortable,

545
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:48,510
let us know.

546
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,350
Okay.

547
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:42,570
You're awake.

548
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,040
Was I drugged?

549
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:55,290
I didn't do it.

550
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,720
Otherwise, you wouldn't have woken up yet.

551
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,010
It was the princess.

552
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,340
What a surprise, right?

553
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,370
I didn't expect

554
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,240
that she would be so bold either.

555
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,590
After she sent me away,

556
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,910
she gave you knockout drops.

557
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,650
She also specially used muscle softening powder on you.

558
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,710
Maybe what I said that day scared her.

559
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,450
She's not resigned to it.

560
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,570
So she wants to go back to the capital

561
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,930
to ask Empress Xiao and Prince Danyang.

562
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,370
She scored a lucky hit.

563
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,840
It really makes me embarrassed this time.

564
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:39,280
Please

565
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,250
help me ask Yuan Lu and the others here.

566
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:44,990
They were drugged too.

567
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,230
I'm the only one

568
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,290
who can move freely now.

569
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,960
Then I really need to bother you.

570
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:53,660
Not at all.

571
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,230
Then you...

572
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,460
Do you want to know what kind of person I am?

573
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,330
Actually, I'm not from the State of An.

574
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,360
I was sold to Scarlet Guards when I was very little.

575
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,440
White Sparrows are worthless. We don't deserve a name.

576
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,170
So they randomly combined the Chinese characters in the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches to call us.

577
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:37,980
I was called Ren Xin.

578
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,710
When I grew up,

579
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,260
I thought it was improper if I didn't have a decent surname.

580
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:44,780
That's why

581
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,190
I added a radical to Ren.

582
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:51,210
It was not easy for you.

583
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:52,820
Well...

584
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:54,060
My benefactor

585
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:55,870
said the same thing.

586
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,190
I asked you to help me find out

587
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,820
who killed her.

588
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,370
She is Empress Zhaojie of the State of An.

589
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:07,810
Empress Zhaojie?

590
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,750
Didn't you get convicted by the emperor of An

591
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:11,780
because you assassinated Empress Zhaojie?

592
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:16,350
Life was hard when I was a Scarlet Guard.

593
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,060
She was the one who treated me the best.

594
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,570
In my heart, she was like a sister and a mother to me.

595
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,620
Why would I hurt her?

596
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,670
I went to Yaoyue Pavilion that day

597
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:37,030
because I wanted to save her.

598
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,670
You're a silly child.

599
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,110
You know nothing except being an assassin.

600
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:47,210
You must remember this.

601
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:51,070
Don't fall in love with a man easily in your life.

602
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,040
But

603
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:56,440
you must have a child of your own.

604
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,690
Go.

605
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,220
She just kept asking me

606
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,920
to leave Scarlet Guards

607
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:19,170
and live happily as I wish.

608
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,120
She also told me

609
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,630
I shouldn't fall in love with a man easily

610
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:28,000
but I need to have a child of my own.

611
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,550
So you changed your name to Ren Ruyi.

612
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,930
Later, I faked my death

613
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,470
and fled to Shengzhou.

614
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,810
I recuperated in the house of a woman

615
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:44,920
who just lost her daughter.

616
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,330
Several years later,

617
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,160
Scarlet Guards sneaked into Shengzhou to recruit White Sparrows.

618
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,410
They didn't know me.

619
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,920
They took me forcibly.

620
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,590
I also wanted to take the chance to find out who killed her.

621
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,730
So I played along

622
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,440
and joined Scarlet Guards again.

623
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:05,300
Everything was really closely related.

624
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,450
But don't worry.

625
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,290
As long as you teach Her Highness well

626
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,180
as promised,

627
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:15,850
I will try my best to help you find out

628
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:17,470
who killed Empress Zhaojie.

629
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,640
Thank you.

630
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,020
But I will fulfill

631
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:26,910
Empress Zhaojie's last wish.

632
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,050
So,

633
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:34,050
I plan to name my future child

634
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:35,960
Ren Xiaochuan. What do you think?

635
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,810
It is easy to remember and sounds nice.

636
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,730
The name of Ren Xiaochuan is quite cute.

637
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,610
But don't you think

638
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,400
it sounds like my name?

639
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,530
And this is your business.

640
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:51,710
You don't have to tell me this.

641
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,290
Although it's my child,

642
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,050
I can't give birth to the child without your help.

643
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,280
Consider the name

644
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,400
as a souvenir.

645
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:00,070
What... What do you mean?

646
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:06,390
Well, did...

647
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,790
did... did I just...

648
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,650
You didn't. But you will later.

649
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,370
I won't force you to do what you don't like.

650
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,280
Are you serious?

651
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:24,150
Well, calm down first.

652
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,750
I'm the one who took the wrong medicine, not you.

653
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:27,790
Don't worry.

654
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,340
I'm very calm.

655
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:31,590
Actually, I've decided to have a baby with you long ago.

656
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,230
You are tall and have nice martial arts skills.

657
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:36,250
No matter whom the child takes after,

658
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,250
it won't be a bad thing.

659
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,110
You're not married.

660
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,190
Even if you have a baby with me,

661
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,210
you won't hurt other women.

662
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,200
You're on your way to the State of An.

663
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,810
Even if you die halfway,

664
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,310
I can help you carry on your family line.

665
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:49,840
It's a win-win solution.

666
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,500
What a good idea.

667
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,370
It's not.

668
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:56,830
The point is...

669
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:00,220
I wanted to seduce you gradually.

670
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:03,340
But a great opportunity came unexpectedly.

671
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:05,350
Such being the case,

672
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,680
let's do it today.

673
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:09,850
Well, calm down.

674
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:10,690
Listen to me.

675
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,750
I won't have a baby with you.

676
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,550
I will only be with the person I like.

677
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,730
Only the person I like and I...

678
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,630
Do you dare to say

679
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,530
you don't have feelings for me at all?

680
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:22,690
Don't lie.

681
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,710
White Sparrows are best

682
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,440
at reading men's mind.

683
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,210
I know

684
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,850
why you've been so gentle to me lately.

685
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,170
You want me to be indebted to you in order to win my heart, right?

686
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,450
You deliberately neglect me first.

687
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:42,470
Then you can find a chance to talk about my past

688
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,920
to care about me and sympathize with me.

689
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:47,720
In that way, it's very likely that I'll love you wholeheartedly.

690
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,180
Mr. Ning,

691
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,060
you're really scheming.

692
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:57,600
-And your body...
-I...

693
00:39:59,090 --> 00:39:59,800
is hot.

694
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,520
Well, what are you talking about?

695
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:08,410
Well, you're right, Ren Ruyi.

696
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,630
I'm scheming.

697
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,560
You'll suffer losses if you have a baby with me.

698
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:13,790
How come?

699
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:17,030
It's a good thing that the child is as scheming as you.

700
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,490
Don't worry.

701
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,100
Female lions on the prairie

702
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,470
always hunt

703
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:22,650
and raise their children on their own.

704
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,760
Male lions just need to cooperate.

705
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,810
You just need to cooperate with me later.

706
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:27,950
As long as we succeed this time,

707
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,270
I won't pester you anymore.

708
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,930
But the point is I'm not a lion.

709
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:32,190
And listen.

710
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:34,210
I'm destined to be alone in this life.

711
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:35,900
My family members are gone.

712
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:37,270
It's not a good thing if the child takes after me.

713
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,070
It's true. The child...

714
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,670
What a coincidence. Me too.

715
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:40,350
I...

716
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,330
Just accept your fate.

717
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,510
I'll promise you one more thing.

718
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:45,970
Well...

719
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,680
After entering the State of An,

720
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:49,570
I'll protect the princess too.

721
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,720
Is that enough?

722
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,250
I don't need it.

723
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,120
Ren Ruyi.

724
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,290
You're forcing me!

725
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:59,390
Scream.

726
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:01,000
Go ahead.

727
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:04,740
Someone!

728
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,730
Someone! Ren Ruyi is crazy!

729
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,740
They were drugged too.

730
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:12,530
They can't help you.

731
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,520
It's useless no matter how loud you scream.

732
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:20,810
Ruyi, listen...

733
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:21,830
Listen to me. Calm down.

734
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,330
Listen to me. I've been poisoned.

735
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:26,910
I've been poisoned.

736
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,390
I'm telling the truth.

737
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,320
Let me finish. Let me finish.

738
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:32,280
Why would Zhang Song

739
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,590
let me leave the capital

740
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,950
with gold and the princess so easily?

741
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:35,650
Before I left the capital,

742
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:36,770
he made me drink qianji poison.

743
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:37,390
Every 10 days,

744
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:38,550
I have to go get the antidote from his men.

745
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:39,970
It's been 7 days since I left the capital.

746
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:41,070
The effect of the poison is the strongest now.

747
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,060
See for yourself if you don't believe me.

748
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:46,150
See for yourself.

749
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,330
It's okay.

750
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:00,900
I have All-Purpose Antidote in my blood.

751
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,300
It can cure all poisons in the world.

752
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,770
With it,

753
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:05,310
I...

754
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:06,290
the child won't be hurt.

755
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:08,790
Well, but... but my kidney energy is insufficient now.

756
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,410
Even if we are lucky and succeed at one stroke,

757
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:11,910
the child may be born with a congenital defect.

758
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:14,770
How about this?

759
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:17,430
I promise you.

760
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,350
But give me 2 more days.

761
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,500
After I take the first dose of the antidote,

762
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:21,800
I will definitely give you what you want.

763
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:25,270
I promise you.

764
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:34,750
These are heart-to-heart butterfly pills.

765
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,630
I'll believe you if you eat it.

766
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:37,540
Okay.

767
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,300
Now,

768
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,300
you can give me the antidote of the muscle softening powder, right?

769
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,620
The antidote is in the water.

770
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,710
I don't need that much water.

771
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:40,350
Ren Ruyi!

772
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,890
Fine. I don't feel hot now.
