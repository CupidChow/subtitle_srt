[A Journey To Love]

00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,930
[Episode 26]

4
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,570
Let me play a song for you.

5
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,840
Yuan Lu,

6
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,160
do you have someone you like?

7
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,340
Yes.

8
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,390
Kind of.

9
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,470
But she will never like me.

10
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,210
So I don't plan to let her know.

11
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,030
Who would like me in the future?

12
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,880
What kind of husband will I have?

13
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,930
Of course you should marry someone who is nice to you.

14
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,640
But considering what we've been through,

15
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,790
can I still go back to Wu

16
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,460
to be an ordinary princess,

17
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:52,770
who will be satisfied

18
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,180
as long as my husband treats me well?

19
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:54,829
Of course you can.

20
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,890
If those boys from noble families know

21
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,590
I disguised myself as a man to be an envoy to An,

22
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,960
would they still dare to marry me?

23
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,690
-Besides,
-Well...

24
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,960
the emperor of An has always been ambitious.

25
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,210
If Wu is in danger again in the future,

26
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,820
can I still be a noble lady

27
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,670
who lives a safe life and grows old in the harem?

28
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:15,870
Well...

29
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,820
You can be an imperial sister who can wield power to protect Wu,

30
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,500
like the princess of the previous dynasty.

31
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,160
Why don't you take charge of Liudao Hall?

32
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,960
Stop dreaming.

33
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:30,940
What's wrong?

34
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,600
What's wrong with sitting here dreaming?

35
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,660
What's wrong? What's wrong?

36
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,370
Anyway,

37
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,720
there is a precedent for a prince to be in charge of Liudao Hall.

38
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,670
Anyway,

39
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,810
Boss Ning will retire after accomplishing this mission.

40
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,650
Anyway, you know well about Liudao Hall.

41
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,550
If you can be in charge of Liudao Hall with the identity of an imperial sister,

42
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,280
that would be great.

43
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:54,970
Interesting.

44
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,050
Well... By that time, if you are still alive

45
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,740
and no one dares to be my husband,

46
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,110
let's be together.

47
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,900
-We're familiar with each other anyway.
-I don't think it's proper.

48
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,770
And you can have a successor and have someone to mourn you after you die.

49
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,190
Don't learn from Ruyi

50
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,540
to force a man to be with you

51
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,650
and make a baby. This is not good.

52
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,130
Don't think too much.

53
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,860
What... What baby?

54
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,410
I can just choose one from the imperial family to be my adopted son.

55
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,240
Can't I?

56
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,410
That's not good either.

57
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:21,930
Just now, I said I want to be your husband,

58
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:22,810
but you didn't agree.

59
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,940
Who didn't agree?

60
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,790
It was you who didn't agree.

61
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,850
Calm down.

62
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,409
It's just cats fighting.

63
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:35,880
Cats?

64
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,600
Cats are gentle and cute.

65
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,210
They don't fight.

66
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,600
He's a liar.

67
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,070
Right?

68
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,400
You get what you pay for. Come on.

69
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,290
Look at this outfit.

70
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,870
Compared to the outfit

71
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,480
Beauty gave to Ning, what do you think?

72
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,610
What do you think?

73
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,850
If I go to Yong'an Temple in this outfit,

74
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,010
do you think I look like a handsome scholar who lives in the temple temporarily

75
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,590
to study hard and pray that he can pass the imperial examination next year?

76
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,610
Yes.

77
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,370
But do you know what you look more like?

78
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,280
What?

79
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,980
Someone who's there to pray to have a child.

80
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:11,810
Pray to have a child?

81
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,790
That's too troublesome.

82
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,450
Think about it. I'm so handsome.

83
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,890
Of course I can have as many children as I want.

84
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,500
I can have a lot of children if I want.

85
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:19,330
Yes.

86
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,800
And the children's family name will be Jin, right?

87
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,380
Of course it'll be Yu. Why will it...

88
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,070
Jin. The family name of everyone in your family is Jin.

89
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:27,610
You are...

90
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,490
I won't force you. Who said I'll force you?

91
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,880
Stop. Fine. No problem.

92
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,890
I'll be your...

93
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,460
backup husband.

94
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:35,700
Backup.

95
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,210
No need. I don't care.

96
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,490
I was just joking. Don't take it seriously. Okay?

97
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,130
Your Highness.

98
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,430
If no one in Wu dares to marry you,

99
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,880
you should look beyond it.

100
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,310
With your current vision and courage,

101
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,200
you are good enough to be an empress.

102
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,300
In this vast world,

103
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,080
there is definitely someone who is perfect for you.

104
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,520
In this vast world,

105
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,460
there is definitely someone who is perfect for you.

106
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,120
Yuan Lu,

107
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,530
we'll be fine.

108
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,800
When everything is settled here,

109
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,490
let's go play pranks

110
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,380
in Yuanzhou and Ruyi's wedding chamber.

111
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,550
It's a deal.

112
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,250
Deal.

113
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:23,660
Here.

114
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,530
Thank you.

115
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,610
This is delicious.

116
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,200
[Mansion of Prince Luoxi, An Capital]

117
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,160
These beads are good.

118
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,850
Deliver them and those fruits from Nanhai

119
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,130
to Noble Consort.

120
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,520
Isn't this too conspicuous?

121
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,310
I told Father

122
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,370
I lost my mother when I was little.

123
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,570
Noble Consort is my mother.

124
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,630
Since I've made it public,

125
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,210
of course I should be filial to her.

126
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,159
All these years,

127
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,330
my life would have been even harder

128
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,350
if it weren't for her.

129
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,940
Since these fruits are rare,

130
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,850
should we put some

131
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,260
at Empress Zhaojie's graveside?

132
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,590
How many times have I told you?

133
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,360
Father doesn't like me to frequently mourn my mother.

134
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,780
She's already gone. What's the use of offering her fruits?

135
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:12,330
Get lost!

136
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,330
Mother.

137
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,050
Actually,

138
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,010
you don't want my mourning, right?

139
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,210
Forgive me, okay?

140
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:42,730
Your Highness,

141
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,100
Huan has been waiting for you in the west wing.

142
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,290
Coming.

143
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,940
[15 minutes later]

144
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,330
Water.

145
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,050
Water.

146
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,400
Bastards!

147
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,850
I'll teach you a lesson!

148
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,000
Your Highness.

149
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,770
Come here.

150
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,310
Ren doesn't want to wear a flower.

151
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,100
Let's help her wear it.

152
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,320
Mother.

153
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,830
Chi.

154
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,560
Why didn't you listen to me?

155
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,790
Why did you make me angry?

156
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:27,810
Kneel.

157
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:30,610
Tell me.

158
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,510
I treated you so well.

159
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,800
Why did you hurt me?

160
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,980
Father, please don't depose my mother.

161
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,640
[Five years ago]

162
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,620
Don't worry.

163
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,350
I don't want to do this either.

164
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,380
But you have to find a way

165
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,480
to make her let it go

166
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,570
and stop forcing me.

167
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,050
And stop her from kneeling in the Imperial Ancestral Temple as an atonement.

168
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,110
If you can do that, I'll make you the crown prince.

169
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,980
Mother,

170
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,040
since you and Father are husband and wife,

171
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,710
you should obey him.

172
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,310
Don't always force him and make things difficult for him.

173
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:04,810
So,

174
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,670
in order to be the crown prince,

175
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,250
you support him in colluding with enemies.

176
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,770
It's no big deal. Why do you still care?

177
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,110
He just bought some horses from Beipan.

178
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:20,570
Mother,

179
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,650
Beipan people invaded us many years ago.

180
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,000
What does it have to do with now?

181
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,880
If you still won't let it go,

182
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,990
how can I become the crown prince?

183
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:28,840
No.

184
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,510
I can't forget my grandfather was killed by Beipan people.

185
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,460
In order to be the crown prince,

186
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,780
I can't believe you've decided to ignore the civilians in Central Plain.

187
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,560
Your Highness, is this really appropriate?

188
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,020
I just submitted a memorial

189
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:51,090
that says my mother is sick and delirious.

190
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,210
As long as the officials believe

191
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,780
she's going to cry in the Imperial Ancestral Temple because she's crazy,

192
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,300
the title of crown prince will be within reach.

193
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,600
You've become despicable,

194
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,820
shameless, treacherous, and evil.

195
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,220
You told them your mother is crazy.

196
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,690
Why do I have a son like you?

197
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,520
Do you think I want to be your son?

198
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,470
You won't help me become the crown prince

199
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,260
and you are always against Father.

200
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,770
You've disgraced the imperial family.

201
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,460
You don't deserve the title.

202
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,170
Bad news! Yaoyue Pavilion is on fire.

203
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,760
Yaoyue Pavilion is on fire.

204
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,050
Help!

205
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,080
Hurry! Empress Zhaojie is still upstairs!

206
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,280
Go put out the fire!

207
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,850
Mother.

208
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,080
The Lotus Hand.

209
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,300
Master, it's really you.

210
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,410
When I saw the wounds on the bodies of Chen Gui

211
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,600
and those Scarlet Guards on the beach,

212
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,630
I vaguely guessed it.

213
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,580
Please stop denying it.

214
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,200
No one but you

215
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,960
would go to Empress Zhaojie's tomb to mourn her.

216
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,690
No one but you would avenge me.

217
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,140
In this world,

218
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:03,940
you're the only one

219
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,390
who knows how to use the Lotus Hand.

220
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,100
I knew you would come to Second Prince.

221
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:14,420
Master, I finally found you.

222
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,950
Master, say something.

223
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,610
Please.

224
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,990
Please admit your identity.

225
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,410
Jiu.

226
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:01,730
[Mansion of Marquis Changqing]

227
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:00,950
Master.

228
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:02,810
You've been hiding your identity.

229
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,740
I know

230
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,270
there must be a reason for it.

231
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:07,950
But

232
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,450
no matter what identity you want to use in the future,

233
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,510
I'm okay with it.

234
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,840
As long as you don't leave me

235
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,870
and always stay by my side.

236
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,820
I came with you

237
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,580
because I just wanted to find a safe place

238
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,010
to ask you a few questions.

239
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,170
Go ahead, Master.

240
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,530
Why did Empress Zhaojie

241
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,380
let herself die in Yaoyue Pavilion?

242
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,130
You've been with His Majesty all these years.

243
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,150
You must have heard of it.

244
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:48,450
Master.

245
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:49,900
Don't make me say it clearly.

246
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,310
Even if you didn't know back then,

247
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,970
Noble Consort Chu must know.

248
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,180
Well...

249
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:06,089
Empress Zhaojie fell out with His Majesty.

250
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,000
That's why she took it too hard.

251
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:14,260
Because His Majesty colluded with Beipan, right?

252
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:15,970
Yes.

253
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,510
Back then, His Majesty wanted to capture the salt mine of Su.

254
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:21,790
So he bought horses from Beipan.

255
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:23,890
Empress Zhaojie tried her best to stop him but failed.

256
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,089
She was angry and wanted to kneel in the Imperial Ancestral Temple.

257
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,180
But...

258
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,730
His Majesty knew if others knew about this,

259
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:30,970
he would probably lose the throne.

260
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,760
So,

261
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,220
he found a way to confine Empress Zhaojie and block the news.

262
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:37,970
He managed to hide it from the officials

263
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,210
and wanted to depose the empress.

264
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,180
Wasn't he worried that Shadong Tribe would be dissatisfied?

265
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,300
His Majesty promised to give Duke Cui 3,000 calvary slaves.

266
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,710
If Shadong Tribe still wanted to cause trouble,

267
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,260
he would sentence Empress Zhaojie's two brothers to death

268
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,600
for competing for Shazhong Tribe's grassland.

269
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,020
Competing for the grassland? Death penalty?

270
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,080
Who framed them?

271
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,630
I haven't figured it out.

272
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,860
Anyway, His Majesty was furious.

273
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,650
And after First Prince drove a wedge between them,

274
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,010
he even wanted to kill Empress Zhaojie to cover up his collusion with Beipan.

275
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,860
He was worried you would come to save her.

276
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,480
So he took action after sending you away

277
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,210
and made it look like a fire accident.

278
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,100
And at this time,

279
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,830
Empress Zhaojie suddenly found out that Second Prince

280
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,880
and Shadong Tribe both agreed to depose the empress.

281
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,900
That's why she was in despair.

282
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,370
So...

283
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:32,480
So,

284
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,490
in order to cover up the scandal,

285
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,740
gain the title of crown prince,

286
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,670
and get 3,000 cavalry slaves,

287
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:43,120
Empress Zhaojie's husband, son, and father

288
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,430
joined hands to betray her.

289
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,690
What Empress Zhaojie cared about the most

290
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,270
was not the title of empress,

291
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,350
but the betrayal of her loved ones.

292
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,310
No wonder she didn't want to leave

293
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,560
no matter how hard I tried to save her.

294
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,220
She was not sad.

295
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,410
She was not ashamed or resentful.

296
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,990
She was in despair.

297
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:13,570
Yes.

298
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,340
I know everything.

299
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,270
I'm leaving.

300
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,440
Master.

301
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,540
Master, don't go.

302
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,580
Don't abandon me again.

303
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,390
I'm not the one who abandoned you.

304
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,800
It's you.

305
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,700
Master, don't!

306
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,720
Master. Master. Let me explain.

307
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,640
I...

308
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,900
What Meiniang said is right.

309
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,860
You really built a room used for secret purposes.

310
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:09,710
Kneel.

311
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:16,980
Look at me.

312
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,910
I'm standing in front of you now.

313
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,710
I'm giving you a chance to explain.

314
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,780
What kind of feelings

315
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,650
do you have for me now?

316
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,570
I... I...

317
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,140
Master.

318
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,350
Don't go.

319
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,280
Ren Xin.

320
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:08,950
I like you.

321
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,340
No. I love you.

322
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,310
My feelings for you

323
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,100
are a man's feelings for a woman.

324
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,770
As long as you are with me,

325
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,330
I'm willing to do anything you ask me to do.

326
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,420
No matter what it takes.

327
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:26,680
Okay.

328
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,120
Then submit a letter of resignation immediately.

329
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:33,360
Hand over the Yulin Army you're in charge of.

330
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:37,700
Give up the imperial family name that you feel proudest of now.

331
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:43,940
And get me some handsome men in the mansion.

332
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,130
What? You can't do it?

333
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:50,450
I...

334
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,780
But as long as you agree,

335
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,150
I won't leave you.

336
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,760
Marquis Changqing,

337
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,290
you are no longer a child.

338
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,770
Don't make a promise you can't fulfill.

339
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,190
When you were little,

340
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,730
maybe you had a trace of affection for me.

341
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,670
But that was just a substitute

342
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,870
for your mother's love that you've never experienced.

343
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,850
Now you've grown up.

344
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:24,570
Your goal

345
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,900
is not just having a family name

346
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,100
that no one will laugh at.

347
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,030
You want to be successful.

348
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,070
You want to be the most powerful official in the world.

349
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:36,070
If you want to be someone like that,

350
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,770
you can't have any weakness or fatal point.

351
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,420
Ren Xin is dead.

352
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:47,280
Princess Huyang is also a fake identity.

353
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,200
No.

354
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,210
Forget everything.

355
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:51,940
No.

356
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,840
Master! Master!

357
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,070
Do you want me to make it clearer?

358
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,700
No one in this world knows better than you

359
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,710
what Empress Zhaojie means to me.

360
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,510
But all these years,

361
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,570
you have never wanted to avenge her.

362
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,980
And you have never gone to mourn her.

363
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:13,810
Have you forgotten who took you to the palace

364
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:14,780
when your mother abandoned you

365
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,350
and who made me your master?

366
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,370
Li Tongguang.

367
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,200
No.

368
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,580
Do you know why I said

369
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,570
it's you who abandoned Jiu?

370
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,550
Because no matter how arrogant and unreasonable

371
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,580
Jiu was back then,

372
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,190
he wouldn't be so cold-hearted.

373
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:38,620
Master.

374
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:40,370
My name is Ruyi now.

375
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,590
I will avenge Empress Zhaojie myself.

376
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:43,790
After that,

377
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,180
I will leave An Capital.

378
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,300
After all, we are master and disciple.

379
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,780
From now on, we should go our separate ways.

380
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,630
♫The east wind is the cruelest♫

381
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,260
Master.

382
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,760
♫It brings rain that reminds me of the day you left♫

383
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:56,710
I'm sorry.

384
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:01,160
But are you really going to abandon me?

385
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:04,150
♫The day you left everything we had shattered on the ground♫

386
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,560
I am your only disciple.

387

♫I end up alone again♫

388
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,590
Forget what's in the past.

389
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:13,690
♫I don't know how many miles I have to go to find you♫

390
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,530
You're not my disciple now.

391
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:22,800
♫I search for your eyes but can only see your back♫

392
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:17,330
It's him.

393
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,770
It's Prince Li, right?

394
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:22,750
It's none of your business.

395
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,140
Stay here.

396
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:32,540
♫I can't tell if this is just a dream♫

397
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,980
Don't follow me.

398
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,690
Do you understand?

399
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,530
Master.

400
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:40,770
♫I don't want to wake up; I can't stop missing you♫

401
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,130

♫You're the one person I can never get over♫

403
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:57,390
♫I want to hold on to you but it's too late♫

404
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:05,850
♫It's too late, so I have to cling to these memories♫

405
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:14,340
♫Forgetting you is a fool's errand♫

406
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,450
Master.

407
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:22,730
♫Forgetting you is a fool's errand♫

408
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,220
You're still up at this hour?

409
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,500
I've been waiting for you to come back.

410
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:16,770
I prepared midnight snacks for you.

411
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,260
This

412
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:29,990
is chicken soup wonton.

413
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,180
I cooked it

414
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,190
when I heard you entering the yard.

415
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,320
Now is the perfect time to eat it.

416
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,260
And this.

417
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,560
I just tasted this

418
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,830
for you.

419
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,560
Although it's not from Zhang's Pastry,

420
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,080
it tastes good.

421
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,340
Come on.

422
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,670
Aren't you gonna ask me

423
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,320
why I came back so late?

424
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:56,730
No.

425
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:00,910
No matter what you do,

426
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,990
you have your own reasons.

427
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,550
If you don't want to tell me,

428
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,120
I won't ask.

429
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,880
Eat.

430
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:18,850
Didn't you say in the future,

431
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:21,900
I cook at home and you travel freely in the martial arts world?

432
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,250
You should get used to this kind of life as soon as possible.

433
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,940
How does it taste? Is it good?

434
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:38,960
You eat too.

435
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,720
I'm really good at cooking.

436
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:50,330
Eat more.

437
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,370
Have a good sleep after eating enough.

438
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,450
I'll take you to a place tomorrow.

439
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,060
The secret archive of the An Capital branch?

440
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,290
In the 8th year of Chengtian,

441
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:20,740
that is, 5 years ago,

442
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:22,120
Empress Zhaojie died.

443
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,160
I've sorted out all the files for you.

444
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,240
They are all here.

445
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:29,150
I want to see the memorial that impeaches the two young masters of Shadong Tribe

446
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,730
over taking Shazhong Tribe's grassland.

447
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:31,940
Okay.

448
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,060
This memorial was submitted

449
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,650
[Memorial Records]

450
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,350
by Tao Wei, Deputy Minister of Personnel.

451
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:44,480
Tao Wei?

452
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:45,760
Yes.

453
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:53,580
The empress is crazy and disobeyed the emperor.

454
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,810
She has bad moral character and doesn't deserve the title of empress.

455
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:08,680
Here.

456
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,840
I also drew a relationship map for you.

457
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,400
Tao Wei

458
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:18,300
is close to Duke Wang, First Prince's father-in-law.

459
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,480
5 years ago,

460
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:23,830
First Prince was just engaged to the only daughter of the Wang family.

461
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,540
If the empress was deposed,

462
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:28,690
Second Prince would no longer be the legitimate son.

463
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:32,480
As the eldest son, he would have a chance to sit on the throne.

464
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,340
So he collaborated with his father-in-law

465
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,660
to order Tao Wei to submit a memorial to impeach Empress Zhaojie.

466
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,220
Let's go.

467
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,070
Okay.

468
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:04,710
Are you alright?

469
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,240
From Second Prince...

470
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,270
Actually, I've already known most of the truth.

471
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:18,020
I also went to Mansion of Marquis Changqing last night

472
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,840
and got some information.

473
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,380
Right.

474
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,460
Li Tongguang knows who I am now.

475
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,550
What you said is right.

476
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,100
In fact, these years, I have thought

477
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,180
His Majesty

478
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,970
is the real cause of Empress Zhaojie's death.

479
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,030
But every time I thought about it,

480
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,310
I didn't dare to think further.

481
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,040
All these years,

482
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:43,840
he has never made anyone his new empress.

483
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,670
And he would often write poems in memory of Empress Zhaojie.

484
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,250
I really can't believe

485
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,320
that unbearable truth.

486
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,120
I understand.

487
00:30:58,910 --> 00:30:59,650
In your heart,

488
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,670
Empress Zhaojie is perfect.

489
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,070
She deserves everything good in this world.

490
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:06,060
You just don't believe

491
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,530
she married a wrong person.

492
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,180
And you didn't expect the emperor of An had the guts to betray his country and kill his wife.

493
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:14,890
Right.

494
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,990
Does Empress Zhaojie's death

495
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,900
have anything to do with Noble Consort Chu?

496
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,030
I don't think so.

497
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:25,520
Noble Consort Chu entered the palace 3 years ago.

498
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,040
After that, he wanted to marry the princesses of other states and make one his new empress.

499
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,080
But over the years, he's been frequently robbing other states.

500
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,810
No one is willing to marry him.

501
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,880
He also said he would never betray Empress Zhaojie

502
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,560
and would never depose the empress.

503
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:42,530
Empress Zhaojie and he got married when they were young. They were in deep love.

504
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,980
If it weren't for Empress Zhaojie's full support,

505
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,530
he wouldn't have been appointed the crown prince by the late emperor

506
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,210
since he's the late emperor's fifth son.

507
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,820
Now I finally understand

508
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:55,360
why Empress Zhaojie wouldn't leave with me.

509
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:59,580
Because she was in despair and she didn't want to drag me down.

510
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,540
After all, her husband gave the order.

511
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,930
Her own son betrayed her.

512
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,160
She could only ask me to run away.

513
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,160
But I was so stupid that I didn't listen to her.

514
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:19,330
No wonder

515
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,640
the Grand Court was sure

516
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:23,800
I was the one who murdered Empress Zhaojie so soon.

517
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,860
No wonder he put me in prison

518
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:28,520
and always refused to listen to my statements.

519
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:31,780
It turns out

520
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,110
he felt guilty.

521
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,220
Let's go.

522
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:53,790
[Siyi Pavilion]

523
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,640
Boss Ning.

524
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,320
Ruyi, you're back.

525
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,200
Thank you for your hard work.

526
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:02,500
Let's go.

527
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:11,510
Why didn't you do anything to Second Prince?

528
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,260
After all, he is the last child of Empress Zhaojie.

529
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,650
I didn't have the heart to do it.

530
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,600
Empress Zhaojie's father, Duke Cui,

531
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:21,210
also died 2 years ago.

532
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:24,090
In the 8th year of Chengtian,

533
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,570
Second Prince was only 14 or 15 years old.

534
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:28,370
Indeed, a young boy

535
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,930
can be easily misled by his father.

536
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:34,300
But at that time, First Prince was already 19 years old.

537
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:37,440
And his father-in-law, Duke Wang.

538
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,220
I won't let any of them go.

539
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,850
[Prince Hedong]

540
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,670
[Duke Wang]

541
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,490
What about the chief culprit?

542
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,800
You know

543
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,310
who I'm talking about.

544
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:19,550
Yes.

545
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:23,250
I need to think carefully

546
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,600
about what I should do.

547
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,500
This is the third person we visit today:

548
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,710
Yin Zi, Minister of Works.

549
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,659
Don't say anything wrong later.

550
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,730
Don't worry. I remember it.

551
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,780
In the next few days,

552
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,880
I'll visit all of An's important officials

553
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,450
who have real power.

554
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,700
I'll ask them to advise the emperor of An to release my brother.

555
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,990
If it works,

556
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,420
you won't need to risk your lives to get him out of the pagoda.

557
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,050
Thank you for welcoming me personally, Minister.

558
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,510
My apologies.

559
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,280
Please.

560
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:41,800
41, 42, 43.

561
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,800
44, 45.

562
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,360
52, 53, 54.

563
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:58,080
55, 56, 57.

564
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:01,630
58, 59, 60.

565
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,960
61, 62, 63.

566
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,370
64, 65, 66.

567
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,150
67, 68, 69.

568
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,110
70, 71.

569
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,300
Ning,

570
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:17,170
I'll make a wish to the Buddha later.

571
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:19,000
I wish even when you are 71 years old,

572
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,600
you can still have a child.

573
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,080
I already have you.

574
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,540
Why do I need a son when I'm old?

575
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,960
We've checked the distance.

576
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,150
The guards outside Yong'an Pagoda

577
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,600
should have excellent martial arts skills.

578
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,730
So we need at least 4 people.

579
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,790
Okay.

580
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,150
Have you noticed

581
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:48,110
the number of the Scarlet Guards' secret sentinels around Siyi Pavilion

582
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:48,970
has increased again these days?

583
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,830
After all, both the Left Emissary and the Right Emissary died.

584
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,810
It's not easy for Deng Hui

585
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,800
to explain this to the emperor of An.

586
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:56,780
So now,

587
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,040
he will never let anything

588
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,110
happen to himself.

589
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,870
We can't persuade the emperor of An to release His Majesty.

590
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,750
So we will save him by force.

591
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,530
He will certainly think of this.

592
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,800
We can't let them be idle.

593
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,630
Let me go find something

594
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,750
for them to do. What do you think?

595
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,350
No need.

596
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,150
The members of the An Capital branch

597
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,570
are working on this.

598
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,400
I believe in a few days,

599
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,110
some officials will submit memorials

600
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,450
to ask Deng Hui to explain the death of the Left Emissary and the Right Emissary,

601
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,350
as well as the details of the collusion with Beipan.

602
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,130
By that time,

603
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,290
we'll disclose more things he did.

604
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,700
Even though he's a trusted aide of the emperor of An,

605
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,090
he can't get away with it easily.

606
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,510
I knew it.

607
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:36,970
Ning, I love you the most.

608
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:37,860
You're evil enough.

609
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,760
But I love Beauty more.

610
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,620
She's cruel enough.

611
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,140
Within just 2 days,

612
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:47,830
she killed the Left Emissary and the Right Emissary.

613
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,470
You are lucky

614
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,920
that you didn't meet her a few years earlier.

615
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,140
Otherwise, you would've...

616
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,500
Let's get down to business.

617
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,590
We also need to prepare evacuation routes in advance

618
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,990
to make sure nothing will go wrong.

619
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,630
I've prepared 3 routes.

620
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,620
First,

621
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,200
the mountain road.

622
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,200
Empress Zhaojie.

623
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,270
Empress Zhaojie.

624
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,530
Where are you?

625
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:40,850
Empress Zhaojie.

626
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,560
Empress Zhaojie,

627
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,950
I told you many times

628
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:11,200
I like to be an assassin

629
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,910
to get rid of those bad people who harm civilians

630
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:16,280
for you and His Majesty.

631
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,100
But His Majesty

632
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,220
betrayed you and the civilians in Central Plain.

633
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,440
So,

634
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,970
I want to kill him.

635
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:30,270
But I'm afraid killing him is not enough.

636
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,380
I also want to reveal the truth to the world

637
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,550
and put an end to it.

638
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,480
What do you think?

639
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:54,860
Ruyi.

640
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:04,760
Ruyi.

641
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:07,840
Ruyi.

642
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,440
Ruyi.

643
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,920
This is the first time you call me Ruyi.

644
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:37,940
I see.

645
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:00,090
Within 1.5 km of this place,

646
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,340
the number of the Scarlet Guards' secret sentinels has indeed increased a lot.

647
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:03,630
Where is Her Highness?

648
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:04,930
Is she back?

649
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,440
We've been standing at the gateway.

650
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,910
Boss Ning and Yu

651
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:09,900
haven't come back either.

652
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,830
I'm not worried about Boss Ning.

653
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:13,810
I'm just worried about Her Highness.

654
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:16,490
After all, this is the first time they act separately.

655
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:18,690
And Marquis Changqing.

656
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:20,710
I heard that he was up to no good towards Her Highness

657
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:22,030
when he was in the palace.

658
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:22,660
Yes.

659
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,200
We need to strengthen our defense.

660
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:29,960
It's Prince Li, right?

661
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:07,820
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

662
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:14,680
Come out!

663
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,010
Or I'll kill you.

664
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:20,980
No.

665
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,420
You almost ruined my beautiful face.

666
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,410
I can only kill you.

667
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:35,820
Boss.

668
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:44,590
The move you used just now is called "Perishing Together".

669
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:46,830
It's your master's swordsmanship, right?

670
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:53,340
It can kill both you and your opponent

671
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,080
if you can't escape while killing him.

672
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:56,970
Li Tongguang,

673
00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:59,710
tell me your reason for doing this.

674
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:04,310
If I kidnap Yang Ying,

675
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:08,240
my master will come to me.

676
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:15,280
I don't care if she'll be sad

677
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,310
or angry,

678
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:20,100
or even kill me.

679
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,960
I just don't want her to ignore me.

680
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,070
I just don't want her

681
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:31,430
to torture me slowly like this.

682
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,080
Listen.

683
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,140
Whether you die or not has nothing to do with me.

684
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,440
But you wanted to kill my brother.

685
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:43,480
You came to hurt other people

686
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:44,740
just because your master ignores you.

687
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:47,420
I thought

688
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,670
you're an ambitious man worth cultivating. I was wrong.

689
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:52,390
Have you ever thought about this?

690
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:54,590
If you hurt His Highness

691
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:55,990
by doing this,

692
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,060
what kind of trouble will An and Wu be in?

693
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,920
But I don't care.

694
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,650
I only want my master.

695
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,760
I only want my master!
