It's okay. I'm almost done.

63
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,110
Why are you so stubborn?

64
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,950
Here.

65
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,720
I heard about it.

66
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,190
You took the good steel kept in An Capital Branch for 20 years

67
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,550
and welded it into a sword for the Beauty.

68
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,620
I, Yu Shisan,

69
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,190
am self-proclaimed in knowing all the romantic skills in the world,

70
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,400
but this time,

71
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,540
you really impressed me.

72
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,870
Adding your blood to the sword

73
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:37,909
is an advanced move.

74
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,510
If I were a woman,

75
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,710
my heart would have melted.

76
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,409
But don't go too far.

77
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:48,830
A battle is imminent,

78
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,430
but you gave yourself such an injury.

79
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,920
I'm fine.

80
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,390
It's just a scratch.

81
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,490
But it doesn't make sense.

82
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,790
You used to be cautious.

83
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,100
Before battles,

84
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,800
you would even personally sharpen your sword multiple times.

85
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,820
Why did you purposely injure your arm this time?

86
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,270
Shisan.

87
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,360
Ning,

88
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,440
you...

89
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:54,830
My internal force is unstable.

90
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,030
The side effect

91
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,600
of the All-Purpose Antidote is losing all internal force

92
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,870
within seven days of taking it.

93
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,550
It's been more than seven days since returning from He County.

94
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,160
Logically speaking—

95
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,270
Logically speaking,

96
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,950
I should have recovered,

97
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,820
but the Ten-Day Qianji is the secret poison of Wu, after all.

98
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,550
It’s not easy to completely remove it.

99
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,380
The two are clashing against each other now.

100
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,700
My internal force is not always available.

101
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,550
At this moment,

102
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,950
it may directly affect

103
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,990
the result in saving His Majesty.

104
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:30,920
And this time,

105
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,270
I can't guarantee if I can come back alive or not.

106
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,530
It's not that extreme.

107
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,409
What if your condition doesn't act up

108
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,750
on the day of the operation?

109
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,890
Since when did the Liudao Hall

110
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,830
put our hopes on luck?

111
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,250
We can't let

112
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,270
the others know about this,

113
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,630
so as not to affect their morale.

114
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,670
If...

115
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,210
If anything happens,

116
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,680
help them escape.

117
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,510
Don't worry about me.

118
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,510
What are you talking about?

119
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,220
Listen to me.

120
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,220
Yuan Lu is too young

121
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,530
and Qian Zhao is too loyal,

122
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,500
so I can only entrust this matter to you.

123
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,050
If you can't get

124
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,750
the name clearing edict,

125
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:49,910
you don't have to insist on it.

126
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,180
Her Highness has gradually matured.

127
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,630
I believe

128
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,630
she will do her best

129
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,670
to clear the name of the Heaven Path.

130
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,690
If you treat me as your brother,

131
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,510
promise me

132
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,070
to bring them all to safety.

133
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,630
Stop it.

134
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,510
Don't leave me

135
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,310
with such a troublesome task.

136
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,290
If you can,

137
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,890
you can entrust Beauty to me instead.

138
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,990
Look, after you leave,

139
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,830
I'll definitely have a romantic life with her.

140
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,440
Do you think I can't defeat you

141
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,230
without my internal force,

142
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,630
so you're bullying me now?

143
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,120
Then promise me

144
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:39,210
to return to the State of Wu with me safely.

You really came alone as promised.

Okay.

00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,410
Shoot the kite down!

189
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,310
You're so slow.

190
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,600
You can't even shoot a kite.

191
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,290
It's down.

192
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,320
Bring it over to check.

193
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,380
You all are too nervous.

194
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,670
It's just a kid's toy.

195
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,070
There's nothing on it.

196
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,390
There are five kinds of rouge in here,

197
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,590
corresponding with five different ways of communication.

198
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,420
We will use a kite as the signal.

199
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,550
Apply rouge of the same color as the kite

200
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,710
and the Liudao Hall will contact you.

201
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,440
We will do our best to save you.

202
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,610
The operation is tonight. Is everything alright?

203
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,680
Please inform us the guards' situation.

204
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,010
His Majesty is ready.

205
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,260
He was very cautious. He didn't write anything.

206
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,890
He drew a picture with a pun

207
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,960
showing that he understands.

208
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,190
The grass

209
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,350
also represents the number of guards.

210
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,710
When will we take action?

211
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,150
At seven.

212
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,260
Yuan Lu is ready.

213
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,770
I've sent Shisan to Hongxiang Brothel.

214
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:24,910
You go first

215
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,300
and get ready by the lake.

216
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,040
Okay.

217
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:38,790
Ruyi?

218
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,990
Boss Ning, people have

219
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,010
worries because they care.

220
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:48,350
Don't worry.

221
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,470
Ruyi is so skilled.

222
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,430
She'll definitely be fine this time.

223
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,640
When did you become so good with words?

224
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,590
The monk in the temple taught me.

225
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,380
Ruyi is indeed strong,

226
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:00,640
but this time,

227
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,430
she's facing the entire Scarlet Guards.

228
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,620
Commander Deng, you're nothing.

229
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,430
Really?

230
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,620
I am the commander of the Scarlet Guards now.

231
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,460
My words are the rules of the Scarlet Guards.

232
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,480
I'm sorry that I can't follow

233
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,270
the old custom of a one-on-one fight.

234
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:56,310
You won't be able to walk out of this door today.

235
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,070
Zheng Chou,

236
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:11,790
Xu Yin,

237
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:13,600
Liu Bing,

238
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,780
do you still recognize me?

239
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,140
Deng Hui ignored the old customs of the Scarlet Guards,

240
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:20,950
but what about you?

241
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,310
Where is the Scarlet Guards' pride

242
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,250
of keeping promises?

243
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,930
Good.

244
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:06,360
Keep patrolling.

245
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:07,210
Yes.

246
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,180
Let's continue patrolling.

247
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,820
These fireworks are too ordinary.

248
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,590
It's your birthday,

249
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,820
so I've prepared some surprises.

250
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,910
Please come with me.

251
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,910
Okay.

252
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:45,590
Look.

253
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:46,980
So beautiful.

254
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,140
Indeed.

255
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,150
So beautiful.

256
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,670
Attack!

257
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,360
There's knockout drug on my sword.

258
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,740
She won't last long.

259
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,960
♫My eyes are blazing and my armor is shimmering♫

260
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,880
♫I have feuds to settle♫

261
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,970
♫Who can lighten my darkness?♫

262
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:54,640
♫Who can see what I've been through?♫

263
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,500
♫Standing on the battlefield, I feel an overwhelming desire to win♫

264
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,630
♫This is when the tide turns♫

265
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,880
♫I chose this path myself♫

266
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,530
♫There's no turning back♫

267
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,390
♫Don't even dream about♫

268
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,370
♫Still manipulating me♫

269
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,440
♫What nonsense♫

270
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,200
♫I fall into the abyss♫

271
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:25,070
♫Only to soar through the sky♫

272
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,140
♫They stab me in the back but I'll come back stronger♫

273
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:32,600
♫My roar shakes the ground when I wield my sword♫

274
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:36,850
♫They say I have no future but I'll rock the world♫

275
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,760
♫The sky is burning♫

276
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:43,840
♫They stab me in the back but I'll come back stronger♫

277
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:47,310
♫My roar shakes the ground when I wield my sword♫

278
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:46,630
You all lost.

279
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:51,500
♫They say I have no future but I'll rock the world♫

280
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,450
♫The sky is burning♫

281
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:57,420
♫There is no right or wrong♫

282
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,790
♫There is no right or wrong♫

283
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,970
♫There is no right or wrong♫

284
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,590
Put on the dragon-tooth shackles. I will bring her into the palace.

285
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:15,470
Yes!

286
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,390
Look over there.

287
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,460
General, look!

288
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,130
Why aren't you on guard against foreign objects?

289
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:39,690
Shoot them all down!

290
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,620
General,

291
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,980
those are just sky lanterns from Hongxiang Brothel across the street.

292
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,840
Sky lanterns?

293
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,910
Do not shirk your duty.

294
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:46,820
Yes.

295
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,410
You two, follow me!

296
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,110
One, two.

297
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,590
When it comes to archery,

298
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,520
it should be up to the most handsome archer.

299
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,850
Shoot down the sky lanterns.

300
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,420
Stop shooting. Cover your mouth and nose.

301
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:28,730
Sound the alarm.

302
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,860
Three, two, one.

303
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,610
Shoot.

304
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:13,180
Ning Yuanzhou.

305
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,800
Did you miss me, Your Majesty?

306
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,450
How are you? Is it relapsing?

307
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,680
I'm fine. Be careful.

308
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,460
Okay.

309
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,590
Go.

310
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,780
Search again.

311
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,070
Don't let anyone escape.

312
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:10,920
Yes.

313
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:16,600
[Donghu Cottage]

314
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,380
It's safe.

315
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,240
Don't worry.

316
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,850
They won't wake up within 12 hours.

317
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,080
I,

318
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:15,270
Ning Yuanzhou, former member of the Liudao Hall Hell Path,

319
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,830
Yu Shisan of the Asura Path,

320
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,380
Yuan Lu of the Hungry Ghost Path,

321
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:19,670
Ding Hui of the Heaven Path,

322
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,130
Guo Yasha of the Heaven Path,

323
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,510
Bao Wenfeng of the Heaven Path,

324
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,630
Li Jiaxing of the Human Path,

325
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:24,670
Jiang Yuan of the Animal Path,

326
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:27,870
along with the Heaven Path's Qian Zhao, Chai Ming

327
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,440
and the other 16 souls

328
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,010
greet Your Majesty.

329
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,720
Please get up.

330
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,350
Rise.

331
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,930
All rise.

332
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,070
Everyone and Chai Ming,

333
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,040
you've worked hard.

334
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,770
After I return to the Wu Capital safely,

335
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,600
I'll write the name clearing edict immediately to notify the world.

336
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,090
Your Majesty, please depart.

337
00:29:59,350 --> 00:29:59,910
Okay.

338
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,130
Yuan Lu.

339
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:01,780
Yes.

340
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:34,510
Boss,

341
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,750
Qian's side is safe.

342
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,870
Okay. Everyone, hurry.

343
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:40,670
The people on the shore will be here in around 15 minutes.

344
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,000
Yes.

345
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,990
Your Highness, let's go.

346
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,710
Where is Chief Clerk Du?

347
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,270
He was just here.

348
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,990
Help!

349
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,030
No!

350
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:15,350
Mr. Du!

351
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,980
I was just packing.

352
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,660
The Scarlet Guard saw that we're escaping,

353
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,310
so he went to report to the others.

354
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,320
Go.

355
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:29,630
Mr. Du.

356
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:30,260
Mr. Du.

357
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:31,590
Mr. Du, wake up.

358
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,640
Qian!

359
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:36,590
Your Highness, Qian is by the lake.

360
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:39,410
What should we do?

361
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,790
No, we have to go to the clinic now,

362
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,030
or else he'll die.

363
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,210
Your Highness.

364
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,780
The carriage is at the door.

365
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,990
I think the surveillance outside has noticed something.

366
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,340
They keep looking this way.

367
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,270
Slow down. Watch your step.

368
00:31:58,850 --> 00:31:59,930
Your Highness, let's go.

369
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,070
We should arrive at the city gates

370
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,250
within an hour

371
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,320
to meet Yuanzhou and the others, right?

372
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:06,910
Yes.

373
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,080
Then I won't leave.

374
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:12,840
Your Highness.

375
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,980
Chief Clerk Du's injury can't be delayed for an hour.

376
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,270
Take him to the clinic immediately and find a doctor.

377
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,020
Have him treat Chief Clerk Du in the carriage.

378
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,710
We can't leave you alone.

379
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,790
Is bringing me out more important than a human life?

380
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,830
Chief Clerk Du is badly injured right now.

381
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,080
Any delay will kill him.

382
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,560
The Scarlet Guards outside

383
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,270
have probably noticed something wrong.

384
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,980
Otherwise, why would they send someone in?

385
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,010
I'm their target.

386
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,640
If I go out with you all,

387
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:37,670
the Scarlet Guards will definitely tail you the entire way.

388
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:38,770
If this affects

389
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,400
Yuanzhou and the others,

390
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,380
everything will be over by then.

391
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:43,980
So, I'll stay and you all go first.

392
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,740
Don't worry about me.

393
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,350
I'm Prince Li after all.

394
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,460
They won't do anything to me.

395
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:50,740
After you save His Majesty,

396
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,560
you can find a way to save me.

397
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,960
But Boss Ning's order is

398
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,910
-that I must deliver you safely.
-Sun Lang.

399
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,130
How dare you disobey

400
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,690
my order to my face?

401
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,570
I dare not.

402
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:07,630
The delegation's mission is to save my brother,

403
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:11,380
while I am the leader of this delegation.

404
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:15,010
Now, I order you

405
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,680
to embark immediately. No objections.

406
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,130
Sun,

407
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,020
you all have been protecting me this journey.

408
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,270
Now,

409
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,240
it's my turn to do something for you all.

410
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:34,900
Go!

411
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,660
Your Highness,

412
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,760
take care.

413
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,910
[Siyi Pavilion]

414
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,150
Be careful.

415
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,200
What's wrong with Mr. Du? There's so much blood.

416
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:02,750
He hit his head. Send him to the clinic.

417
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,590
Stop talking.

418
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,990
Mr. Du must be cured.

419
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:06,150
Hurry. Don’t delay.

420
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:06,650
Let's go.

421
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:31,090
I saw it clearly.

422
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,949
Du was indeed injured.

423
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:34,949
Ignore them.

424
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,570
Just keep an eye on Prince Li.

425
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:38,710
Yes.

426
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,320
Buddhas above,

427
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,010
please bless Yuanzhou and Ruyi

428
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,560
to be able to leave the city safely.

429
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:39,980
Bless Mr. Du to be able to recover

430
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,640
and for Yuan Lu, Qian, Shisan

431
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,900
and Sun to be unscathed.

432
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:50,000
Bless my brother to return to Wu safely.

433
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,630
I, Yang Ying, am willing to shorten my life by ten years.

434
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,080
No.

435
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,700
I, Yang Ying, the Prince Li,

436
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,990
sincerely make this wish.

437
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,830
Shisan, bring His Majesty away first.

438
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:21,850
I'll stay and cover the rear.

439
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:22,540
Okay.

440
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,180
Don't be afraid, Your Majesty.

441
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,660
I have this.

442
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:29,760
This...

443
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,960
Emperor of Wu, look.

444
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,950
I'm by your side and Ning Yuanzhou is behind us.

445
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,060
What are you afraid of?

446
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,440
If you're not afraid,

447
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,720
enjoy this lake scenery with me.

448
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:49,710
If you're afraid,

449
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,430
close your eyes.

450
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:52,600
Let's go.

451
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:05,430
Who is it?

452
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:07,620
Go!

453
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,540
Go help them.

454
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,460
Yes.

455
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,040
Archers!

456
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,220
Hold tight!

457
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,550
Take him into the water.

458
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:40,170
Okay.

459
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:41,860
Let's go.

460
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,550
Boss, are you okay?

461
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,300
I'm okay.

462
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:26,400
Let's go.

463
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:26,940
No!

464
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,260
Your Majesty.

465
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,370
Your Majesty!

466
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,230
Your Majesty!

467
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:47,980
Over there, hurry!

468
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,030
Don't let them get away!

469
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:49,730
Over there.

470
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,370
Qian Zhao, take His Majesty to the carriage.

471
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,820
The rest of you, evacuate immediately.

472
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:53,570
Yes.

473
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,830
You caught Ren Xin?

474
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,220
I have completed the mission.

475
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:24,630
Your Majesty, you can be at peace from now on.

476
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:42,810
Kill her.

477
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:52,650
Ren Xin, don't!

478
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:56,490
I don't dare to die

479
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,240
when the evil dragon hasn't been slain yet.

480
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,910
Deng Hui,

481
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,080
you are very brave.

482
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,190
How dare you collude with her to assassinate me?

483
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,800
I am loyal.

484
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,340
He is too stupid

485
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:12,720
to deserve to collude with me.

486
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,690
What do you want?

487
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:17,250
Ren Xin,

488
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,100
taking His Majesty hostage is a capital crime.

489
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,790
Do you think you can get out?

490
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:22,520
I dared to come here,

491
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,050
so I naturally won't be afraid.

492
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,990
Didn't you lose consciousness earlier?

493
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,310
Commander Deng,

494
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,330
I'm much more familiar

495
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,940
with both the Scarlet Guards and knockout drugs than you.

496
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,070
You lost.

497
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:45,710
Please.

498
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:48,290
Please save my sister.

499
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:50,630
Kneel down.

500
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:02,320
Shanhu.

501
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,550
Here.

502
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:05,550
Yes,

503
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,800
I will do all I can.

504
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,030
This sword

505
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,690
is a love token from my lover.

506
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,940
It hasn't killed anyone yet.

507
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:38,460
Li Sun,

508
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,890
would you like to be the first one?

509
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,760
Ren Xin,

510
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:44,420
what do you want?

511
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,520
Do you want to avenge the empress

512
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,080
or do you want my money?

513
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:51,950
I want to

514
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,560
ring the Anyang bell.

515
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:04,470
The Anyang bell?

516
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,120
It's the Anyang bell that gathers all the officials.

517
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,990
What happened? Let's go.

518
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:13,830
Move!

519
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:15,860
Hurry!

520
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:21,670
There's a problem.

521
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,570
Hurry to Siyi Pavilion and detain Prince Li.

522
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:32,090
[Siyi Pavilion]

523
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,100
Break in.

524
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:34,550
My lord.

525
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,300
My lord!

526
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,760
My lord, bad news!

527
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:41,910
Two whistling arrows sounded.

528
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:43,310
Something happened in the palace and at Donghu Lake.

529
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:43,870
Calm down.

530
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,340
Donghu Lake is under the responsibility of the court guards.

531
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:50,820
Let's go to the palace now.

532
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:54,430
The Anyang bell means that something important must have happened in the court.

533
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:55,700
Get ready to return to the city immediately.

534
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:56,450
Yes.

535
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,070
Have you cleaned up the crossbows and gear?

536
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,130
They're all hidden.

537
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,740
I'll do acupuncture again to see if he'll wake up.

538
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:03,150
Okay.

539
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:08,630
Boss.

540
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,650
What if His Majesty doesn't wake up?

541
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,200
Why don't we forge a false name clearing edict?

542
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:16,750
We can think of other ways for the fingerprint and flower seal.

543
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,290
Prepare the name clearing edict,

544
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:21,140
but the most urgent thing now

545
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:22,790
is to wake him up.

546
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,270
He saved Shisan just now.

547
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:29,550
Okay.

548
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:31,530
What should we do now?

549
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,920
Continue with the original plan.

550
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:35,380
We have to wait for Ruyi to return.

551
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,430
Lord.

552
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,170
What happened to Mr. Du?

553
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,440
Where is Her Highness?

554
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:56,220
I'm guilty.

555
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,110
I didn't take good care of Her Highness.

556
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,830
What happened? Tell me.

557
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:14,790
Prince Li is still inside.

558
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,480
We have been guarding so tightly.

559
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:18,320
He has no wings to fly out with.

560
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,060
Search the place!

561
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,090
This way.

562
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:23,880
Your Highness, hurry!

563
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,120
Your Highness, hurry!

564
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,710
Fire! Fire!

565
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:56,860
Bells and gongs are ringing in the middle of the night.

566
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:57,760
What's going on?

567
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,300
Fire! Fire!

568
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:01,250
Put out the fire!

569
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:07,260
The Scarlet Guards set a fire in the middle of the night to kill me.

570
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,960
Those who save me will be heavily rewarded.

571
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:13,290
It's gold.

572
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,680
Those bastard Scarlet Guards

573
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:18,030
are such a disgrace to An.

574
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:19,070
Let's put out the fire!

575
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:21,270
Put out the fire! Let's go!
