Beipan actually…

67
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,900
How could Second Prince do this?

68

Cai City and Jing City have sent reinforcements.

69
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,180
But He County is still undermanned.

70
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,200
Beipan's king has gathered an army of more than ten thousand

71
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,010
at Tianmenguan.

72
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,450
He County

73

will be lost in this battle.

74
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,540
Wu is well-fortified,

75
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,420
so if He County falls,

76
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,800
Beipan is most likely to attack An.

77
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,860
He County is farther from here than An Capital.

78
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,900
Just the two of us going to He County

79
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,500
won't make much of a difference.

80
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,500
The priority now

81
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,270
is to get the emperor of An to declare war

82
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,270
and send reinforcements.

83
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,400
That's the only way to stop Beipan's invasion.

84

the emperor of An

86
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,740
has consented to this whole thing Second Prince did?

87
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,270
He once tried to conspire with Beipan.

88
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,180
It was he who sent Second Prince to Tianmenguan.

89
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,900
Could he be the one behind it?

90
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,060
Don't think about that.

91
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,940

92

Out of my way!

186
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,460
Who are you?

187
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,110
I came with an urgent military report.

188
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,420
Let me in.

189
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,580
Why is the commandant of Hexi Cavalry here?

190
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:56,560
You can't go in.

191
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,020
Second Prince will be proclaimed crown prince soon.

192
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,700
We've been ordered to cross-examine everyone

193
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,700
before letting them in.

194
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,290
Stop him!

195
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:11,930
You can't go in!

196
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,220
Why are my steps lighter and lighter?

197
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,580
It's as if I had wings.

198
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,300
[Duke Qing's Mansion in An Capital]

199
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,220
That dumbass Li Zhenye is back now.

200
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,180
I invited you over

201
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,890
to tell you to run away.

202
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,380
Once he becomes the crown prince,

203
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,350
you can never leave here.

204
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,780
I told you.

205
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,290
I'm not leaving.

206
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,910
Then don't blame me for not helping you in the future.

207
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,180
Li Tongguang.

208
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,540
Li Tongguang.

209
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,640
Li Tongguang.

210
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,940
Who is shouting outside?

211
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,820
You heard it wrong.

212
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,420
Li Tongguang.

213
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,170
I've said everything I need to say.

214
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,220
Quiet.

215
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,700
Li Tongguang!

216
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,770
Stop!

217
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:11,980
Yuan Lu!

218
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:15,980
Release him!

219
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,560
I order you to release him!

220
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,510
Yuan Lu, wake up!

221
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,660
Why are you here, Yuan Lu?

222
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:27,900
I have ginseng.

223
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:29,620
Send for a physician.

224
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:30,380
-Hurry.
-Yes.

225
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,060
Open your mouth.

226
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:34,940
Yuan Lu.

227
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:39,470
Beipan…

228
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,700
Beipan's army has breached Tianmenguan.

229
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:49,620
We held He County at the cost of almost 1,000 lives.

230
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,420
This is the military report.

231
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,340
This is General Wu's blood-stained clothes.

232
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,170
He died defending He County.

233
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,460
Hurry.

234
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,900
Go save Shisan.

235
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,770
They're about to lose.

236
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,040
I'm going to the court now.

237
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,420
You'll all be at Her Highness's command.

238
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:15,910
Yes.

239
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:17,819
Let's go.

240
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,460
Get me a physician!

241
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:32,210
I-I ran for days to finally get to An Capital.

242
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,540
I traveled for more than 300 miles.

243
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:39,420
I-I'm good at running, aren't I?

244
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,600
You're great.

245
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,900
You're the best.

246
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,580
There are many things

247
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,900
I'm not good at.

248
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:51,810
B-But in Liudao Hall, I'm the one

249
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,420
who r-runs the fastest.

250
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,220
I know.

251
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,820
I'm the fastest one.

252
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,050
I know. I know.

253
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,840
You run the fastest.

-You don't know.
-I know.

255
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,050
You don't know.

256
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,540
That night on the roof,

257
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,340
you didn't know anything.

258
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,620
Do you have someone you like?

259
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:17,740
Yes.

260
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,290
Well, sort of.

261
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,380
But she'll never like me.

262
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,300
So I'll never let her know.

370
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,300
During your journey, did you hear anything

371
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,270
about Beipan people?

372
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,490
No.

373
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,610
After the proclamation ceremony,

374
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,860
I'll pay more attention to them.

375
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,740
I dare Beipan people to do anything.

376
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,580
-Duke Qing.
-Forgive me for barging in.

377
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,140
Duke Qing.

378
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,340
But it's urgent.

379
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,860
Princess Licheng's attendant

380
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,620
brought an urgent military report from He County.

381
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,580
He County?

382
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,620
Are Wu people

383
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,160
trying to reclaim the land they lost?

384
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,530
Father, don't listen to him.

385
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,360
I just came back from there.

386
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,660
Everything was perfectly fine.

387
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:03,800
You!

388
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,940
How dare you!

389
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:07,860
Your Majesty, read the military report first.

390
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,170
Then you can punish me.

391
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,580
Leave.

392
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,220
Tianmenguan. Beipan soldiers.

393
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,120
Impossible.

394
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,340
It's absolutely impossible.

395
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,010
I swear on my life

396
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,930
that this report is true.

397
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,290
Idiot!

398
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,860
How dare you

399
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,020
collude with Beipan and keep me in the dark?

400
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:59,820
You don't deserve to be my son!

401
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,540
Father!

402
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,200
Father!

403
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,430
Father!

404
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,700
Father.

405
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,750
I'm wrong.

406
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,810
But I had no choice.

407
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,050
They threatened to kill me. I had to do it!

408
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:17,250
I just led them to He County.

409
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,890
That was Wu's place anyway!

410
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:20,370
This is General Wu's blood-stained clothes.

411
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,660
He died defending the city with the civilians.

412
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,030
On the back of the report,

413
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,970
there are the fingerprints of ten esteemed old people of He County.

414
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,380
Your Highness, do you dare to say those words again

415
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,820
to General Wu's blood-stained clothes?

416
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:57,950
Your Majesty.

417
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,620
Beipan people are coming back.

418
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,980
There'll definitely be deaths and bloodshed again.

419
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,490
Your Majesty, I beg you to punish

420
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,450
Second Prince for treason.

421
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,570
No. No.

422
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,520
Father.

423
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,460
The penalty for treason is death.

424
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,130
I…

425
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,180
When you let Beipan's army pass Tianmenguan,

426
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,020
didn't you know the penalty for that was death?

427
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,050
I'm wrong.

428
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,220
Father, please forgive me.

429
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,370
Your Majesty.

430
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,540
Please make the hard decision.

431
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,380
For your country and people,

432
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,230
you must not condone your son's behavior.

433
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,810
Tongguang, let me ask you.

434
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,740
Besides Princess Licheng,

435
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,780
who else knows about this?

436
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,860
Marquis Wuyang, what are you doing?

437
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,620
Open the door!

438
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,050
I'm just carrying out the order.

439
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:22,110
Duke, calm down.

440
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:26,460
What's going on?

441
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,450
It seems the emperor of An has put us under house arrest.

442
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,820
Have you really talked with Beipan people?

443
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,180
Yes.

444
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,540
Beipan has a tactician.

445
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:56,140
He reached out to me first.

446
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,330
Then take my seal

447
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,400
and tell him

448
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,020
I can offer him

449
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,490
the maps and defense layouts of He County and its surrounding area.

450
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,180
After the war, I'll also give him 100,000 stones of grains,

451
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,820
50,000 taels of silver, and 50,000 bolts of silk every year.

452
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,460
My condition is

453
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:19,460
that they win a few battles at first

454
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:25,010
and then let me defeat them somewhere.

455
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,620
After that,

456
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:31,730
whether they want to return to the north or invade Wu,

457
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:33,290
I don't care.

458
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,660
A great victory over Beipan

459
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,700
can surely help you regain the people's support.

460
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:42,970
But can I…

461
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,710
Can I still be the crown prince?

462
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,970
What do you think?

463
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,500
Li Tongguang, Princess Licheng,

464
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:01,100
and everyone else who knows about this

465
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,180
have been put under house arrest by me.

466
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,100
Before the proclamation ceremony,

467
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,020
I'll deploy troops with Duke Chu as the commander.

468
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,700
I'll raise him high.

469
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,700
The harder he falls,

470
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:24,130
the greater my military achievement will appear.

471
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,960
[Three days later]

472
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,220
Your Highness.

473
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,620
They don't taste good,

474
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,990
but you still need to eat to recover better.

475
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,530
I don't have an appetite.

476
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,070
You haven't eaten much lately either.

477
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,130
The food An people sent us

478
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,450
is simpler and simpler.

479
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,740
I'm fine.

480
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,580
I'm young. I can take it.

481
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,860
Eat.

482
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,700
Or I'll be angry.

483
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,610
By the way,

484
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,060
how is Duke Qing?

485
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,010
He's young and proud.

486
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,130
This is a huge blow to him.

487
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,380
I'm worried about him.

488
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,250
He's been quiet

489
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,140
and brooding.

490
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,870
He knows martial arts, so I asked him the day before yesterday

491
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,650
why he didn't climb over the wall to escape.

492
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,100
He just pointed at the archers on the wall

493
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,120
and left.

494
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,860
How can he be the cabinet grand secretary?

495
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,100
Yuanzhou overestimated him.

496
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:37,860
Your Highness.

497
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,940
Duke Qing got all his glory from two sources.

498
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:45,580
One is his mother Princess Qingning.

499
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,450
The other is the battles he won.

500
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,580
Now that the emperor of An has taken Yulin Guards from him

501
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,830
and confined him,

502
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,100
what can he do after escaping?

503
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,180
Is he to wander around and be a normal civilian?

504
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,220
It'd be better to stay and play it by ear.

505
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,850
After all, he didn't commit any capital crimes.

506
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,900
Are you okay?

507
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,340
Not eating well recently

508
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,850
is making my stomach hurt.

509
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,370
It's my fault.

510
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,330
We don't even get to drink hot water these days

511
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,900
yet I forced you to eat these cold dishes.

512
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:24,100
Wait for me.

513
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:25,640
I'll heat them for you.

514
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,080
Your Highness.

515
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:46,240
Tongguang.

516
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,940
What Ren Xin did last time

517
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:53,300
really embarrassed me.

518
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,300
The proclamation ceremony is coming.

519
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,180
If something goes wrong now,

520
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,460
what will the officials think of me?

521
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:06,700
I'm tired.

522
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,380
Why did you put out my fire?

523
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:36,320
Do you want to die?

524
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,690
Why are you burning aconite?

525
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:38,660
It's poisonous.

526
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:42,220
There's no such plant in Jiangnan.

527
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,160
I just saw

528
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,720
some dried plants over there

529
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,860
and took some to…

530
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:52,920
Since this plant is poisonous,

531
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:54,420
can we gather some more

532
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,410
and burn it to knock out the guards outside?

533
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,570
What did my master teach you?

534
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,210
This outer palace is so big.

535
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,110
How much aconite will you have to burn?

536
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,420
Master only taught me

537
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,660
never to be a sitting duck.

538
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,600
You've lost the Yulin Army

539
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,040
but still have your dukedom.

540
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,480
If we can escape…

541
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,250
Fine. I'll drop the subject.

542
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,620
You're a princess

543
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,060
but can actually start a fire to boil water.

544
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,170
My mother was made a palace maid only after she died.

545
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:41,940
Winters in Jiangnan

546
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,740
can be freezing cold.

547
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,810
As an unloved princess, if I hadn't learned to do these things,

548
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,140
I would've long died.

549
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,060
When I was young,

550
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,490
I often ate cold pancakes too.

551
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,010
You had a father who was the emperor,

552
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,400
but I didn't even have a father.

553
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,480
Are you trying to make me feel better?

554
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,739
Take this taro root as a thank-you gift.

555
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,590
It's cooked and tastes better when hot.

556
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,239
Let's share it.

557
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:38,750
Here.

558
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,400
If Master knew

559
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,170
I used her Qingyun Sword to cut a taro root,

560
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:06,740
what would she think?

561
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:08,860
She wouldn't give a fig.

562
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,410
This sword is called Qingyun?

563
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,060
What's wrong?

564
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,260
I knew someone

565
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,820
whose name was also Qingyun.

566
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:33,050
I hope you have a better ending than him.

567
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,060
Was he your lover?

568
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,550
But you're wearing mourning clothes for Yuan Lu.

569
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,370
What's the problem?

570
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:49,950
Who says a woman

571
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:52,310
can only fall in love with one man in her life?

572
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,380
Do women

573
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,380
have to conform to the stereotype

574
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,470
that expects us to stick to one man

575
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,700
no matter what kind of person he is?

576
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:05,740
Besides,

577
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,900
Yuan Lu and I were in the kind of relationship you think.

578
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:14,290
Fine.

579
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:17,000
Anyway,

580
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,250
my master is the only woman

581
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:23,790
I'll ever love.

582
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,830
Life is long.

583
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,190
Who knows what will happen in the future?

584
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:34,970
By the way,

585
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,900
I want to thank your subordinates.

586
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,650
After Yuan Lu died,

587
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,890
they immediately arranged his funeral for me

588
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:44,930
and set a memorial tablet for him in the temple.

589
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,300
You're welcome.

590
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,740
Instead of thinking about him,

591
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,700
you should think about what my uncle, the emperor of An,

592
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,320
will do to you in the future.

593
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,460
Li Zhenye has colluded with Beipan.

594
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:03,380
I'll in no way marry him.

595
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:12,690
Actually,

596
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,540
I've been in contact with Liudao Hall's

597
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,880
An Capital Branch.

598
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,060
If they find out I'm under house arrest,

599
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,850
they'll surely come to save me.

600
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,180
I believe once Yuanzhou and Ruyi

601
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,450
know what happened,

602
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,700
they'll come to help us out too.

603
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,530
The water is hot. Do you want some?

604
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:41,460
No, thank you.

605
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,030
Who are you?

606
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,370
Don't kill me.

607
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,600
I'm here to help you.

608
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:07,660
Chu Yue?

609
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,480
I'm really here to help you.

610
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,060
What's going on?

611
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,230
My father and brother

612
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,820
were sent to He County with reinforcements a few days ago.

613
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,660
Once they left the capital, they noticed that everything was wrong.

614
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,540
The reinforcements were carrying too few provisions.

615
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,260
There were enough bows

616
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,260
but arrows were 60% short.

617
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,230
My father thinks

618
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,530
His Majesty is not serious about the war against Beipan.

619
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,740
So he wrote a letter to me

620
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,570
and asked me to keep an eye on things in the capital.

621
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,020
This morning,

622
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:34,980
Ren Ruyi and Ning Yuanzhou

623
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,360
came to my mansion.

624
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,080
What?

625
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,980
My master went to see you?

626
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:40,660
It's true.

627
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:44,050
Ren Ruyi said

628
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,420
your sword is called Qingyun.

629
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,940
She gave it to you at the drill ground.

630
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,250
It used to belong to Empress Zhaojie.

631
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,470
Ning Yuanzhou said

632
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,780
his mother's surname was Gu.

633
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,650
She was your preceptor

634
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,310
and taught you from when you were three to seven.

635
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:54,740
It's really them.

636
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,860
Go on.

637
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,740
They received messages from Liudao Hall

638
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,100
and Jinsha Pavilion halfway.

639
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:03,920
Then they hurried to An Capital

640
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,540
and interrogated an attendant of Li Zhenye

641
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,170
to find out that you're under house arrest.

642
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,650
The guards here are from Shaxi Tribe.

643
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,060
So they asked me to get you out.

644
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,310
They didn't know them.

645
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:13,300
Why?

646
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,740
Because Ning Yuanzhou said

647
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:24,880
His Majesty wants to conspire with Beipan

648
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,550
and has sent my father to his death.

649
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:31,300
He plans for my father to be defeated by Beipan's king.

650
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,340
He wants to sacrifice the whole Shaxi Tribe

651
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,490
in exchange for a big victory

652
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,260
so that he can cover up all the scandals

653
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,220
and stay on the throne.

654
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,060
I knew it.

655
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,740
There will be chaos after the proclamation ceremony.

656
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,750
Time is running out.

657
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,930
The guards change shifts every half an hour.

658
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:58,210
Change your clothes now.

659
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:00,910
Liudao Hall's men are waiting for you outside.

660
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:04,700
With their help,

661
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,100
we can be safe outside.

662
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,830
I think you need this more than I do.

663
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,860
Yuanzhou gave it to me.

664
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,850
Press here and a needle will be ejected out.

665
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,460
Whoever gets shot will faint immediately.

666
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,210
Use it to protect yourself.

667
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,410
Thanks.

668
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,220
Your Highness.

669
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,620
[Animal]

670
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:45,490
Take care.

671
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:50,260
My Lord.

672
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:03,900
Although I've been trained to fight,

673
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:05,540
I've never fought in combat before.

674
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,430
I'll lend you all my cavalry slaves.

675
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:10,320
Bring them

676
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,860
to save my father and brother.

677
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,980
Why did you say

678
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,820
there will be chaos after the proclamation ceremony?

679
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:22,450
Where are Ning Yuanzhou and my master?

680
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,900
Ren Ruyi and Ning Yuanzhou

681
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,880
will expose His Majesty and Li Zhenye's crimes

682
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,300
in front of all the officials at the ceremony

683
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,620
to force His Majesty to issue an edict

684
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,420
to unite the country against Beipan.

685
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,440
I'm afraid they may fail,

686
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,570
so I hope you…

687
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:38,210
Fail?

688
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,250
Why do you think they may fail?

689
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,430
Because neither of them

690
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:50,220
is at their best.

691
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,980
The two of them

692
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:54,260
rode for days and nights

693
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,210
to get to An Capital.

694
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:57,180
Ren Ruyi is suffering from old injuries

695
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:59,350
and Ning Yuanzhou's internal force seems unstable.

696
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,620
-They…
-How is my master?

697
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,860
She looked good.

698
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:06,700
About four guards in my mansion fought her together

699
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,860
but none was her match.

700
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,420
It's just that she…

701
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:10,660
-Stop it.
-She…

702
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,840
You want me to save your father and brother, right?

703
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:34,740
Lend me 50 guards from Shaxi Tribe first.

704
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,860
What for?

705
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,700
By the will of God,

706
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,980
this edict is issued.

707
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:04,530
Here it goes.

708
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:11,220
The second prince Li Zhenye

709
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,420
is talented, benevolent,

710
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,660
dutiful, and loyal.

711
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:17,770
Therefore,

712
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:22,020
the second prince Li Zhenye is now proclaimed crown prince.

713
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:26,500
All courtiers and officials, heed my words respectfully.

714
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,980
Support my heir.

715
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,650
Make An prosper.

716
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:36,780
Spread this edict far and wide to let all be informed.

717
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

718
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:45,140
Long live the emperor of An.

719
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:48,900
Long live the crown prince.

720
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:22,540
If you don't want me to break his neck,

721
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,530
you should all stay back.

722
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:27,510
Ren Xin?
