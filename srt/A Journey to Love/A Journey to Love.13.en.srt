[Episode 13]

4
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,850
Princess Jin Ming,

5
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,190
please remember,

6
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,830
our marriage is His Majesty's edict.

7
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,350
No matter how reluctant you are,

8
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:56,910
or how much you despise me,

9
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,530
I'll be your husband from now on.

10
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,870
My honor and shame is also yours.

11
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:03,810
Do you hear me?

12
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:05,800
Dream on!

13
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,250
A toad wants to eat swan meat.

14
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,410
I will rather die than marry you.

15
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,950
Then die.

16
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,190
How do you want to die?

17
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,350
I have poison and ropes.

18
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,200
How about I give it to you now?

19
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,110
I know you hate me.

20
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,050
Don't worry.

21
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,530
I've never liked you either.

22
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:32,710
But,

23
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:35,410
in the future,

24
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,410
we better look like we are cooperating well on the surface

25
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:41,890
but in private,

26
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,079
let's just keep everything fuss-free.

27
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:57,960
Otherwise,

28
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,550
I have tens of thousands of ways

29
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,520
to make your remaining life miserable.

30
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,720
By then, whether it's your father

31
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,190
or your calvary slaves you take lightly,

32
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,530
no one can help you.

33
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,100
Do you think

34
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,540
I'd like you?

35
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,420
How dare he look down on me?

[Caicheng
The delegation's temporary dwelling]

37
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,020
Here.

38
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:53,690
Mr. Ning.

39
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,630
Caicheng's posthouse was damaged due to war.

40
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,120
It's being rebuilt.

41
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,910
Please have Prince Li rest here for the time being.

42
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,570
Thank you.

43
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,510
See you.

44
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,510
The guards of Caicheng are quite reasonable.

45
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:13,790
Yes.

46
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,660
His mother was from the royal family.

47
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:16,810
Although she was demoted,

48
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,079
but no matter what,

49
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,440
there's still some kinship in there.

50
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:22,490
Qian Zhao.

51
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:23,780
Keep a look on this place.

52
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,890
I'm going to the division here.

53
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,780
The news from the headquarters is unclear.

54
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,180
There are some things I need to talk face to face with them.

55
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,360
You haven't fully recovered.

56
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,140
Let me go with you.

57
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,680
Yes, let's go together.

58
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,650
Me too.

59
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,560
Me too.

60
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,970
No need. Why would so many people go together?

61
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:37,950
It'd be too eye-catching.

62
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:38,810
I can go by myself.

63
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,040
Come out.

64
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,050
When did you find out?

65
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,980
I saw you when you first arrived at the ruined temple.

66
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,850
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

67
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,790
I've been keeping watch for you for so long out here.

68
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,150
You keep watch better when I do myself.

69
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,610
You used me again.

70
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,930
You finished the antidote?

71
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,220
How did you know I was here to get the antidote?

72
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,659
When you treated me in the car,

73
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,550
I found something was wrong.

74
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,250
When I calculated the time,

75
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,710
I guessed it’s likely that the Ten-Day Qianji had relapsed.

76
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,180
You're not allowing the others to follow you.

77
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,230
Could it be,

78
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,170
they didn't know you were poisoned?

79
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,230
Yes, I didn't tell them.

80
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,210
Now all the divisions in various areas

81
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,710
and Zhao Ji's follower,

82
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,270
Zhang Song,

83
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,760
would send the antidote over with a courier pigeon every month.

84
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,370
If I told Thirteen and the others that I was poisoned,

85
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,410
a conflict is likely to happen.

86
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,290
But my priority now

87
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,800
is to save His Majesty.

88
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,600
We must be united.

89
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:25,980
So,

90
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,770
I'm the only one who knows.

91
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,220
Yes.

92
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,390
Only you know.

93
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,210
There's a shop that makes malt candy ahead.

94
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:39,350
It tastes good.

95
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:40,540
Do you want to try it?

96
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:43,970
Here.

97
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,150
Why do you like sweet food so much?

98
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,530
Because my father passed away

99
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,130
when I was a kid.

100
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,700
I was raised by my mother alone.

101
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,470
I was young back then.

102
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,940
I was mourning for three years.

103
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:07,630
I didn't have the chance to go out and play

104
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,670
or meet other people.

105
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,520
But Godfather came to see me every month.

106
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,410
So at that time, Godfather

107
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,690
and the candy he brought every month

108
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,540
were the biggest happiness of my childhood.

109
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,160
I'll give you mine too.

110
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,190
You can have double portions every time.

111
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,500
It'll make it up for

112
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,650
those you missed out on in the past like this.

113
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:47,140
Thank you.

114
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,200
But some things

115
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,750
can never be made up.

116
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,610
I know how it is for a child

117
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,920
to grow up without a father.

118
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,120
That's why

119
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,880
why I rejected you before.

120
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,170
I can teach my child well

121
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,040
on my own too.

122
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,810
I believe you are good at martial arts.

123
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,510
But I don't believe you can teach children well.

124
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,340
I taught male disciples

125
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,510
and princesses.

126
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,330
Whether it's a boy or a girl,

127
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,530
I know how to deal with them.

128
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:25,590
Look.

129
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,120
Using the word "deal with" on your own child.

130
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:29,750
For example,

131
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,850
he's just a baby.

132
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:33,630
What if he refuses to drink your milk?

133
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:34,809
I'll beat him

134
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:35,830
and punish him to kneel.

135
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,870
If he wants his father to play with him,

136
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:41,240
are you going to tell him

137
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,669
"your mother will go poking bird nests

138
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,610
and crawl into doghouses with you"?

139
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,650
Why can't I take go poking bird nests with him?

140
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,630
Besides,

141
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,700
I'm going to only have a daughter and not a son.

142
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,220
How can you be sure

143
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,510
that you will have a daughter?

144
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,350
I have a secret recipe.

145
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,430
What?

146
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,250
When the Second Prince was ten,

147
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,470
Her Highness wanted a princess.

148
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,590
So she found a prescription from the people.

149
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,750
Although the little princess died,

150
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,590
the prescription must be effective.

151
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,190
You believe that?

152
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,230
Yes.

153
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,750
I believe everything Her Highness says.

154
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,510
Besides,

155
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,020
she was my only family in the State of An.

156
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,610
What about

157
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,320
your biological parents?

158
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,670
When my mother gave birth to my younger brother,

159
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,230
both my mother and my brother passed away.

160
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,680
My father wanted to remarry.

161
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,260
He thought I was a burden,

162
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,270
so he sold me to the Scarlet Guards.

163
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,250
For just 10 copper coins.

164
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,620
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

165
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:19,500
Let's go.

166
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,780
I'll take you to a place.

167
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,520
Good!

168
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,210
Bravo!

169
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,800
What do you think? Isn't this view good?

♫My palm line branched because of you♫

171
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,270
Those are wounded soldiers, right?

172

This is good.

173
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,690
Yes.

The rise and fall of the world

177
00:10:58,690 --> 00:10:59,650

00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,710
When I was in the Imperial Prison of An,

191
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:27,250
♫I'm hopelessly in love♫

192
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,910
there was a high-ranking official who was about to be executed.

193
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,290
He said something similar.

194
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:27,790
But what he said was not as deep as you.

195
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:30,780
What did he say?

196
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,310
He said

197
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,610
His Majesty is the master.

198
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,450
And the people are cows and horses.

199
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,320
He, me,

200
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,670
and the officials and Scarlet Guards

201
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,140
are the dogs His Majesty use to herd sheeps.

202
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,590
At first, I was very angry.

203
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,060
Scarlet Guards risk their life for His Majesty.

204
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,690
How are we dogs?

205
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,830
But later I thought,

206
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,340
he was right.

207
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,130
His Majesty should know the best about

208
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,510
how loyal I was to Her Majesty.

209
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,160
But he still put me in the imperial prison.

210
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,940
He didn't listen to me at all.

211
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,430
So when I escaped from the imperial prison,

212
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,090
I just thought of it as I have already betrayed the Scarlet Guards

213
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,650
and no longer serve His Majesty as my master.

214
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,770
I still remember what that high-ranking official said.

215
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,230
He said

216
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,710
if the emperor is not being merciful,

217
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,910
just follow your heart.

218
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,620
And you said something similar.

219
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:36,090
♫I always wear a frown♫

220
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:36,880
In fact,

221
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,520
♫Only you know why♫

222
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,350
we don't need to care too much

223
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,610
about what the higher-ups say.

224
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,630
We're all human

225
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:45,480
♫I once gave up hope♫

226
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,560
We need to have our own mind

227
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,370
and our own judgement.

228
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,230
♫You left me with a broken heart♫

229
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,190
Ideals

230
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,610
and everything we're doing now,

231
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,680
♫I should forget about you but I can't♫

232
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,670
we are doing them willingly.

233
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:55,180
No one is ordering us around with a whip.

234
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:59,420
♫How can I let go?♫

235
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:57,460
Yes.

236
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,040
So I've been doing my missions.

237
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,820
♫Drowning my sorrows is like cutting running water with a knife♫

238
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,670
I seems like I like being an assassin.

239
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:08,590
♫It feels like I can never reach the end of the tunnel♫

240
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:06,980
But I know

241
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,470
only by being fearless of our own deaths

242
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,330
♫When the ship sails♫

243
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,270
can we protect the people.

244
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:16,040
♫Travel on the boat for thousand of miles without asking how far♫

245
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,230
For example, Feng Xiang, a Dingnan military governor,

246
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,220
are people who are born to fight.

247
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,970
♫You're my righteous past life♫

248
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,770
Her Majesty once said

249
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,490
every time they send troops

250
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:24,690
♫Someone from the past who made me blue♫

251
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,630
there will be thousands of innocent souls.

252
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:25,210
Yes.

253
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:26,830
So by killing,

254
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,530
♫You're the wine I can never get enough of♫

255
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,910
you're actually saving people.

256
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,440
♫An indispensable part of my life♫

257
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:32,790
That's right.

258
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:39,450
♫My one and only♫

259
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,470
A reward for you.

260
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,050
My wish now is

261
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,960
to avenge Her Highness and Ling Long.

262
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,570
And have a child that belongs to myself.

263
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,220
After you save the Emperor of Wu,

264
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,110
and clear Heaven Path's name,

265
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,800
what else do you want?

266
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:07,600
♫Drowning my sorrows is like cutting running water with a knife♫

267
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,110
I haven't decided yet.

268
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,650
I will think about it later.

269
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:11,370
♫It feels like I can never reach the end of the tunnel♫

270
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:13,340
No wonder you refused no matter how hard I forced you.

271
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,110
♫When the ship sails♫

272
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,210
It's because

273
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,830
♫Travel on the boat for thousand of miles without asking how far♫

274
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,070
you always thought of me as a whip.

275
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,400
Then why did you agree afterwards?

276
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,760
♫You're my righteous past life♫

277
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,480
♫Someone from the past who made me blue♫

278
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,880
Because you're pretty.

279
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,220
And you give me candies.

280
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,320
♫You're the wine I can never get enough of♫

281
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:33,510
They're all yours.

282
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,230
♫An indispensable part of my life♫

283
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:42,350
♫My one and only♫

284
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,520
[An Capital
Yong'an Pagoda]

285
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:17,760
Marquis.

286
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,020
You're finally here.

287
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,710
Your Majesty doesn't have much money left now, right?

288
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,620
Yet you're willing to bribe the guards with

289
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,510
such a huge gold button.

290
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,150
How dare I not come?

291
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,130
Marquis, please have a seat.

292
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:38,650
Tell me.

293
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:40,590
What is it?

294
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:43,550
This time,

295
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,220
I've been humiliated many times since I was captured.

296
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,140
Fortunately, you helped me many times.

297
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,630
But I didn't expect that when I came to the capital of your state,

298
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,100
I had to be dragged by your people

299
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,510
to be shown in front of the temple for four hours everyday.

300
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,480
For that four hours,

301
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,570
I also get fingers pointed at by you An people.

302
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,270
But Marquis,

303
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,500
although I lost,

304
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,430
I'm still the ruler of a state.

305
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,380
Look at this room.

306
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,640
A blanket thinner than paper.

307
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,120
Porridge so watery it can reflect my face.

308
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:20,970
I don't even have a bucket as a toilet

309
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:22,810
in the whole room.

310
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:25,270
How can I live here?

311
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,350
Then why don't you die?

312
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,330
Don't get me wrong, Your Majesty.

313
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,390
I mean

314
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,490
we can revive after we die.

315
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,240
There are many wild chickens

316
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,740
who want a bite by a phoenix in trouble.

317
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,740
Even if I want to help,

318
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,140
how many times can I save you?

319
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,380
How about

320
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,620
you just

321
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,730
and stab here.

322
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,110
You won't die.

323
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,180
I don't want to die yet.

324
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,280
It's up to you.

325
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,930
Anyway, I'm not the one

326
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:12,660
who's being tortured all day long.

327
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,170
Marquis, it's too easy for you to say that.

328
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:50,760
You have no idea

329
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,950
because you haven't been through life and death situation.

330
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,790
You don't know how important life is.

331
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,250
If I don't think we have a common enemy,

332
00:17:59,270 --> 00:17:59,830
do you think

333
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,330
I would take the risk of being discovered by His Majesty

334
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,610
to meet you secretly?

335
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,890
But you still came.

336
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,570
Marquis.

337
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,810
isn't what you've done all along the way

338
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,360
just to befriend me

339
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,750
so when the two states are having peace talks,

340
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,490
you're able to have a say too?

341
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:22,850
I understand.

342
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,700
As long as you can help me escape,

343
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,320
I will stop the war with you.

344
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:45,650
If that's the case,

345
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,340
that's good too.

346
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,720
There are only 6 divisions

347
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,730
that can still be contacted in the State of An now.

348
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,870
But the most important An Capital division

349
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,660
has been silent.

350
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,850
But what we need most

351
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,080
is for the An Capital division

352
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,150
to provide us with some information about the State of An's Court.

353
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,150
There's one person missing here.

354
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,440
Wait for my return.

355
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,230
Everyone is discussing

356
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,640
about what to do after entering the State of An.

357
00:19:58,690 --> 00:19:59,590
Join us.

358
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,030
You Liudao Hall are having a discussion.

359
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,130
What does it have to do with me?

360
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,870
Because you're my partner.

361
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,160
I told you before.

362
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,050
I won't apologize to you.

363
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,170
Because there's no need to apologize between partners.

364
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,110
Besides, Yu Shisan and Sun Lang

365
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,040
owe you a life.

366
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:32,990
People of you Liudao Hall

367
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:34,440
have really worthless lives.

368
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:41,750
Going this way,

369
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,290
we will pass by Jingcheng tomorrow.

370
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,080
Are we going to stop by?

371
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,400
Now everyone is here.

372
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,430
Beauty, come.

373
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,390
Sit here.

374
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,790
It's spacious here. Beauty, here.

375
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,480
Ruyi, have some tea.

376
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,660
Ruyi, here.

377
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,720
Be careful, it's hot.

378
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:04,610
Wait.

379
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,610
I have to clean it before you sit.

380
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,340
Come on.

381
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,170
This way, please, Ruyi.

382
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:16,850
Please.

383
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:17,640
Have a seat.

384
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:37,850
All right.

385
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,360
Thank you for your accepting me.

386
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:40,890
Let's forget

387
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:42,480
the past.

388
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,840
But let me make it clear.

389
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,050
First,

390
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,070
my relationship with Scarlet Guards

391
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,570
won't affect the delegation.

392
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,940
But please stay out of it.

393
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:56,380
Second,

394
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,360
I used to be a Scarlet Guard

395
00:21:58,850 --> 00:21:59,850
and was taught under Yang Ying.

396
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,040
I'll try my best to help.

397
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,100
But I won't be involved in your operations.

398
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,590
Of course.

399
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,770
As long as Beauty is willing to help,

400
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:09,470
it's my blessing for eight lifetimes.

401
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,300
Boss Ning knows how to choose the best candidates.

402
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,220
Awesome.

403
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:12,960
Awesome.

404
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,690
Boss Ning is awesome too.

405
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,890
You have great foresight, Boss Ning.

406
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,030
As expected of Boss Ning.

407
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,810
Of course Boss Ning is the best.

408
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,720
Exactly.

409
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,190
All right.

410
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,520
Let's get down to business, okay?

411
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,690
If you Liudao Hall aren't able to find out about the

412
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,560
internal feud between Prince Hedong and Prince Luoxi,

413
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,780
then it'd be the same case here.

414
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:34,340
After all, I left the State of An five years ago.

415
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,530
There is a period of time where

416
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38,750
I was recuperating in a poor state in the countryside.

417
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,530
Although I rejoined the Scarlet Guards

418
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:42,470
at the Wu Capital branch a year ago,

419
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,310
I was just a White Sparrow.

420
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,830
I couldn't get any core information.

421
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,070
It's okay.

422
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,790
If you don't have information,

423
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,180
we can make a trip to Jinsha Pavilion.

424
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,650
Jinsha Pavilion?

425
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,920
What is it relationship with the State of Su's Jinsha Sect?

426
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:00,770
They are the same sect.

427
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,590
Jinsha Sect

428
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,650
is the largest salt gang along the coast.

429
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,290
But they have been cultivating many spies in recent years.

430
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,670
They started doing middleman business.

431
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,610
Whether it's military information, court affairs

432
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:12,690
or tea and iron business,

433
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,570
we can ask them about it.

434
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,800
Although the information there may not be accurate,

435
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,810
but they rely on

436
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,310
countless gangs in the country.

437
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,780
Sometimes the information they find

438
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,200
is faster than us.

439
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:24,720
So occasionally,

440
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,390
we also buy some information from them.

441
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,140
Yes.

442
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,930
They're based in Jinbao Inn and Jinsha Pavilion located in various places.

443
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,570
There's nothing special about Jinbao Inn.

444
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,880
It's the same as ordinary inns.

445
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,730
But Jinsha Pavilion

446
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,000
is the number one brothel in the world.

447
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,240
What's that expression?

448
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,210
You've never heard of it.

449
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,270
There is a myriad of beauties,

450
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,530
and so much good wine that can fill the sea.

451
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,380
The sound of gambling games are very loud.

452
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,630
Even the musician who plays the pipa

453
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:59,470
is someone they spent a lot to recruit from Xisai.

454
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,040
Most importantly,

455
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,530
no matter how you play inside,

456
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,310
they won't tell anyone about it.

457
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,540
Really?

458
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,060
Where is the nearest Jinsha Pavilion?

459
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,090
It's at Jingcheng which is 70 miles from here.

460
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,260
We will pass by it tomorrow.

461
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,060
How did you know? Who took you there?

462
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:23,440
When did you go there?

463
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:25,500
Boss.

464
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,450
Will we pass by there tomorrow?

465
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,470
I don't know if we will pass by.

466
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,700
I always asked Qian Zhao to go.

467
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,680
[Jingcheng
Jinsha Pavilion]

468
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:15,190
Stay calm.

469
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:16,630
Take your time to look around when we go in there.

470
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,080
Ruyi.

471
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,590
is it really okay for us to come here?

472
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,490
What if we meet

473
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,520
with Yuanzhou?

474
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,600
What should we do?

475
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,510
I told him before

476
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,300
that I would find a suitable opportunity

477
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,430
to bring you guys to a restaurant to have a look.

478
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,750
He didn't object.

479
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,290
But we didn't say we were going to come now.

480
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:37,570
And we didn't say it's Jinsha Pavilion that we are coming to.

481
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:38,880
What?

482
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,300
They can come and seek information

483
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,530
but we can't?

484
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,290
Exactly.

485
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,470
Sirs, welcome to Jinsha Pavilion.

486
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:52,750
Get us a good room.

487
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,340
Please come this way, Sirs.

488
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:58,770
Amazing.

489
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,860
Come on.

490
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:06,590
Sir.

491
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,740
Have a drink.

492
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,050
Come on.

493
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,200
Come on, have a drink.

494
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,140
Have a drink.

495
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,590
Sir, let's drink.

496
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,270
Look carefully.

497
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,390
Do you really think we are sirs?

498
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,130
Sir, have a drink.

499
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:22,660
-No, no.
-Come on.

500
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,260
I brought my sisters to come out and have some fun.

501
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:24,910
Sir, here.

502
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:27,710
We came to see if there are any flaws in our disguise.

503
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,070
Elder Miss Sir,

504
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,830
other than the fact that you look pretty,

505
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,430
you have no other flaws.

506
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,580
What about Younger Miss Sir?

507
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,150
Though she didn't shy away when she saw us,

508
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,830
the way she looks at us is like she's looking at snakes.

509
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,860
She's not interested in us at all.

510
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,030
As for this sir,

511
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,840
though he's sitting upright,

512
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,760
his gaze

513
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:59,530
looks like that of a young man full of vitality.

514
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,180
Look, you're sweating.

515
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:03,290
Do you hear her?

516
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,010
It's useless if your relatives think your disguise is good.

517
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,320
You need to be able to fool them.

518
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,620
Let me wipe it for you.

519
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,140
Have a drink.

520
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:12,990
Here, try it.

521
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,780
Ask for tips now.

522
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,510
H-How can I be more like a man?

523
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,550
Have a grape.

524
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,740
-Ruyi, that's enough.
-Come on.

525
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:23,650
Here.

526
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,230
I'm afraid

527
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,560
just this is not enough.

528
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,320
If Boss Ning knows,

529
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,630
he will kill me.

530
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,280
Sir.

531
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,300
He wouldn't dare.

532
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,000
All righ.

533
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:41,820
Let's drink.

534
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,720
Please enjoy.

535
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,520
Mr. Qian,

536
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,490
Although you are a regular customer,

537
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,960
this question is too confidential.

538
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,790
I'm afraid

539
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,970
only our Chief can make the decision.

540
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:24,180
I met Chief Sha a few years ago.

541
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,660
Unfortunately, Chief Sha passed away three years ago.

542
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,190
Chief Jin is in charge now.

543
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,930
Please introduce him to us.

544
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,440
Unfortunately,

545
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,360
Chief is not here today.

546
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,940
I dare not make my own decision.

547
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,230
I can only report it tomorrow.

548
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,920
Please come again tomorrow.

549
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,260
Okay, thank you.

550
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:07,600
Seeing how tight-lipped she is,

551
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,090
I think there's a good chance.

552
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:18,290
Let's go.

553
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:26,850
It's been years since I last came.

554
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,070
Jinsha Pavilion is getting bigger.

555
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,970
Looks like Chief Jin is more capable than Chief Sha.

556
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:34,670
I won't drink anymore.

557
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:37,830
What's wrong?

558
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,260
I seem to hear Yuan Lu's voice.

559
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,530
Yuan Lu's voice?

560
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:47,310
I really can't drink anymore.

561
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,930
It's okay. One more time.

562
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,260
Come on, you have to bring up your aura this time.

563
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,530
Yes, be imposing.

564
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,450
Here, Sir.

565
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:58,010
Okay.

566
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:01,290
Just a little more. One more time.

567
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,590
No more. No more.

568
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,310
Yes, bring it up.

569
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,430
A little more towards the front.

570
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,620
Lower your gaze.

571
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,310
Here, Sir.

572
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,030
I can't drink anymore.

573
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,390
No. I can't drink anymore.

574
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,870
Yes, your hands should be strong.

575
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,270
Have another drink.

576
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,830
Just look over there and stare at it.

577
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:15,710
Go!

578
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,520
Is your husband here?

579
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,250
Don't worry.

580
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,970
We were just chatting with her.

581
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:49,520
We didn't do anything else.

582
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,080
You're here.

583
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,240
Great.

584
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,640
Let's have a drink together.

585
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,300
They have nothing to do with me.

586
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,540
They are both this young lady's brothers.

587
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:06,690
Yes, they are all my brothers.

588
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,070
Come on, brother-in-law.

589
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:20,770
Stop pretending.

590
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:40,610
Is brother-in-law always so old-fashioned?

591
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:42,340
Yes.

592
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:46,490
He's usually the most old-fashioned and boring.

593
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:19,860
Here.

594
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,240
I was wrong.

595
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,230
I didn't expect you'd do this.

596
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:33,870
Aren't you drinking?

597
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,800
I forgot. You have your old injury.

598
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:44,680
Here.

599
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,000
This malt candy is delicious.

600
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:50,720
It's very sweet.

601
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,920
I was going to bring it back for you.

602
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,660
Try it.

603
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:01,490
I'll drink.

604
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:02,750
Today,

605
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,700
I'll risk my life to accompany

606
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,590
you.

607
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,410
Yuanzhou.

608
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,640
She really just brought us out

609
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,440
to see the world.

610
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,990
We did nothing else.

611
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:35,010
There's him too.

612
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:36,950
You two are learning to be bad now, aren't you?

613
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,510
Do you know what kind of place this is? How can you come here?

614
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:52,800
We were talking about how

615
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,810
this dragon claw chrysanthemum is no ordinary plant.

616
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:58,570
I wonder which classy lady raised it.

617
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,450
You are wrong.

618
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,670
Although all these flowers

619
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,020
were taken care of by Chief Wu,

620
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,230
but he...

621
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:09,969
But his beard

622
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,699
is this long.

623
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:15,810
Is that so?

624
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:30,850
Qian, slow down.

625
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:31,929
Okay.

626
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,690
What's wrong with you today?

627
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,730
You look weird.

628
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:46,639
Nothing.

629
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:49,929
Are you thinking about what happened at Jinsha Pavilion?

630
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,170
Do you think

631
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,210
that I took them out

632
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,570
without your permission,

633
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,500
so you're angry?

634
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:01,770
I told you about this before.

635
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,970
You also said

636
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:07,900
the area from the delegation to Jinsha Pavilion in Jingcheng

637
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,460
are all Liudao Hall's territory.

638
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,170
The thing is,

639
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,190
it's useless for me to be angry.

640
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:17,030
Every time you promise me things will go well,

641
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:18,680
but they always go against the rules.

642
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,150
I didn't want to go.

643
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,340
But when I entered the city,

644
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,990
I saw the emblem on Jinsha Pavilion's flag.

645
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,050
What emblem?

646
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,930
I used to have a capable subordinate.

647
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:42,330
Every Scarlet Guard

648
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:44,050
has their own flower seal.

649
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:46,660
Her flower seal was a dragon claw chrysanthemum.

650
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:51,310
No wonder you asked the dancers those questions.

651
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,140
Unfortunately, it's not her.

652
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,040
Not only the surname was wrong,

653
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,960
the gender was wrong too.

654
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:01,490
You

655
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,430
really trust that person?

656
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,710
She's a Red Emissary I cultivated personally.

657
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:11,140
She helped me escape from the imperial prison.

658
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,930
The alcohol is getting to my head.

659
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:20,650
Call me when we arrive.

660
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:47,270
Here.

661
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:20,630
[Jingcheng
Temporary dwelling of the delegation]

662
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:28,850
Ning.

663
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:31,050
Did you know...

664
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,850
You just came back from Jinsha Pavilion and yet you're still drinking?

665
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:37,690
Do you want to die?

666
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,480
You came at the right time. Drink with me.

667
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,530
Okay.

668
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:45,450
It's quite a big deal too.

669
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:47,570
What's wrong?

670
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:49,700
Is it related to Beauty again?

671
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,640
What's wrong?

672
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:59,570
Aren't you two doing well these days?

673
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,020
Men

674
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:08,650
should be generous sometimes.

675
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:09,850
After all, she has stayed

676
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:10,760
in your room for a night before.

677
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,200
Yet you're still being so innocent.

678
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,000
That's not appropriate, is it?

679
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,560
I'll make the decision for you.

680
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,830
Isn't it just a kid.

681
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:17,890
Close your eyes and just give it to her.

682
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:19,590
I did.

683
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,340
I mean

684
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,210
I promised to give it to her .

685
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:25,750
But not now.

686
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:27,480
We have to wait until everything is over.

687
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:28,910
It's not just an empty promise

688
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,420
or a plan to stall things.

689
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,240
She must be very happy.

690
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:36,730
She is very happy.

691
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,170
But I'm not happy.

692
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:43,980
Since I promised her,

693
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,360
she felt that everything was settled

694
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:48,530
and stayed the same as before.

695
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:54,650
I can't say the same, but...

696
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:57,110
She might be more concerned about me as compared to the past

697
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,480
but this concern

698
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,510
is just like that black and white horse that's being tied down out there

699
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,910
with some added bean cakes to it's feed.

700
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,030
Do you understand that feeling?

701
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:13,890
No.

702
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,120
You're drinking alone

703
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:20,530
just because her attitude is not right?

704
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,170
I don't think so.

705
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,740
Tonight, just now,

706
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,520
something must've happened.

707
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:27,770
Yes.

708
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:30,010
She also went to Jinsha Pavilion.

709
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,350
She also invited a few beauties to her room.

710
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:35,400
Hey. Don't make a fuss.

711
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:42,430
She did get some beauties to join her.

712
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,860
But nothing could have happened.

713
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,730
She didn't even notice that I was angry.

714
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:48,770
She was very relaxed

715
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,530
and drank with those youngsters

716
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,280
at close proximity, you know?

717
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,020
But it's because she's so relaxed

718
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:56,890
and her lack of care for anything that made me feel...

719
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:58,680
This shouldn't be the case.

720
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:00,940
Didn't you think it through before?

721
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,220
Beauty is the type

722
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:03,650
who looks like a femme fatale on the surface

723
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:05,530
but has many things she doesn't actually understand.

724
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,910
Of course I thought it through.

725
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,040
I told myself that many times too.

726
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,530
I said she didn't mean it.

727
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,530
She doesn't know now does she understand.

728
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:14,440
I only have a promise to have a child with her.

729
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,050
She isn't imposing any restriction on me either.

730
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,130
But...

731
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:18,660
But...

732
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:20,900
But I just...

733
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,470
just want to drink.

734
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:23,450
Come on.

735
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,520
Ning, oh, Ning.

736
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:31,850
I didn't expect this would happen to you too.

737
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:33,810
I've known you for so many years.

738
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:36,530
I thought you would be a man that can't be moved.

739
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,350
Look at your horrible state now.

740
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:39,970
You're annoyed.

741
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,490
I'm telling you what I truly feel.

742
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:42,970
Why are you making fun of me here?

743
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,040
Get out.

744
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:46,490
You're anxious.

745
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:47,820
Do you want me to help you?

746
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,050
How can you help?

747
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,650
I knew that something's wrong with Beauty.

748
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,840
But I couldn't put a finger on it.

749
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:07,010
Now that I know she used to be a Scarlet Guard,

750
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,260
I suddenly understand.

751
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:12,980
The Scarlet Guards, though they are pretty,

752
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,890
they live miserable lives.

753
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:16,410
Especially the White Sparrows.

754
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:17,650
They are just toys.

755
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:19,050
They've been controlled by drugs all their lives.

756
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,740
Even if one day they're successful,

757
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,970
they'd be either spies or murders.

758
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,130
How many can live till they're 30?

759
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:27,250
It's not easy.

760
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,430
I'm used to being cold-hearted,

761
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,580
and living a miserable life.

762
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:33,590
When she saw those beautiful youths,

763
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,300
it's just...

764
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,450
it's just like seeing ordinary flower and plants.

765
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,450
Just like that head chrysanthemum you saw.

766
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:43,000
Don't take it to heart.

767
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:44,530
I know these things.

768
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:45,850
Let me finish.

769
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,140
Beauty doesn't care about you now.

770
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,450
It's because she doesn't even know it herself

771
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:50,970
what you are in her heart.

772
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:51,930
You need to

773
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:53,490
let her understand.

774
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,760
You have to

775
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:01,450
let her know you're not that head chrysanthemum.

776
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,160
You have to make her

777
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,630
jealous.

778
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:07,200
Make her become possessive.

779
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,640
Become possessive?

780
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:17,330
But in our delegation,

781
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:18,530
the only women are Her Highness and her.

782
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:19,300
How can I make her possessive?

783
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:21,780
Let me give you an example.

784
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,050
If she asks you for help,

785
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:25,430
just tell her you're busy.

786
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:27,220
If she gives you something,

787
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,240
just, in a passing, mention that

788
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,660
what the girl you used to date

789
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:31,810
gave you certain things too.

790
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,490
If she dares to approach another man again,

791
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:35,970
just turn your back and leave.

792
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,170
Tell her you're unhappy.

793
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:39,800
You'd no longer father her child.

794
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,960
Look at you now.

795
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:45,580
You're keeping silent while pretending to be generous.

796
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,250
This is useless, right?

797
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:51,290
Are what you said reliable?

798
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:54,050
She has seen so many men.

799
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:55,410
Can she not see through these tricks?

800
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:01,140
Ning has seen many men.

801
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:02,210
But once a woman falls in love,

802
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:03,330
it's different.

803
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,110
Stop dragging it on.

804
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:05,810
Think about it.

805
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,770
Is there anyone in this world

806
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:09,170
who understands women better than me?

807
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:10,530
No.

808
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,010
Trust me. Tomorrow.

809
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:14,240
Try it.

810
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:32,490
Jingcheng is the last big city left

811
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:33,530
in Wu.

812
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:35,530
Do you think we should

813
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,490
purchase some items before we enter An

814
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:38,660
for future use?

815
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,930
Okay. I’ll do it now.

816
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:46,270
Mr. Du.

817
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:48,090
I’m fine. It's just my old back injury.

818
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:50,210
Mr. Du.

819
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:56,980
Are you going to Jinsha Pavilion tonight?

820
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:05,250
When are we leaving Jingcheng?

821
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:08,450
Tomorrow.

822
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:12,370
I would like to go out in a disguise

823
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,420
and try to get some information from the Scarlet Guards here.

824
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:27,530
Ning Yuanzhou.

825
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:31,860
Okay, please help yourself.

826
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:38,710
These are secret reports from Palace of Hell.

827
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:43,090
Can you help me

828
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:45,190
help me arrange these information later on?

829
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,250
Go look for Shisan.

830
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,640
He knows women better than I do.

831
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:52,900
Yuan Lu.

832
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:54,370
Bring me the map.

833
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:55,360
Okay.

834
00:44:58,490 --> 00:44:59,250
Ruyi.

835
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,470
There's a letter

836
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:19,930
from Ms. Pei for him among the secret letters.

837
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:20,610
A love letter.

838
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:22,150
It's definitely a love letter.

839
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:22,590
Really?

840
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:23,690
If not why would Boss Ning decide to

841
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:26,520
stay in Jingcheng after seeing it.

842
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:27,880
There's a good reason.

843
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:28,470
Here.

844
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:30,530
An Capital is here.

845
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,230
We can just follow this path to continue on.

846
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:38,930
Good morning, Miss Ruyi.

847
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,480
It's already noon.

848
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:41,650
Not morning.

849
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:05,250
Mission completed.

850
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:06,130
Lang.

851
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:10,270
Did you see that?

852
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:12,350
She's anxious.
