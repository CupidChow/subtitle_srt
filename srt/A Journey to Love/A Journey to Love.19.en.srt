[A Journey To Love]

00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,000
[Episode 19]

4
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:48,670
Besides,

5
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,080
Miss Ruyi herself is a spy.

6
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,210
If you ask her to talk to Marquis Changqing,

7
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,480
I don’t think she'll be averse to it.

8
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:10,919
Mr. Du.

9
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,070
Do you know how much I'm restraining myself

10
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,990
from hurting you?

11
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,700
Mr. Ning.

12
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,900
Mr. Ning... M-Mr. Ning.

13
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,380
Listen carefully

14
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,620
to what I'm about to say.

15
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,090
I won't repeat it again.

16
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:40,900
Firstly,

17
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,290
women are not to be easily betrayed

18
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,190
or used as pawns in exchanges.

19
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,860
The Liudao Hall I governed

20
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,280
has never degraded any female officer by making them use their looks.

21
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,940
It's the same for this delegation.

22
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,270
Secondly,

23
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,579
Ruyi's martial arts skills and schemes are far better than mine.

24
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,770
I can't respect and love her enough.

25
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,050
How could I treat her as a pawn in my hands

26
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:01,970
and give her to someone else?

27
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,890
What you said just now

28
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,750
was a great insult

29
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,020
to her

30
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,640
and to me.

31
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,100
Mr. Ning...

32
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,630
Thirdly!

33
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,030
I can die for the State of Wu.

34
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,390
But Ruyi shouldn't bear that responsibility.

35
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,650
For you, me,

36
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,010
Her Highness, and everyone,

37
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,860
she's already sacrificed a lot.

38
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:28,290
Mr. Du.

39
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,670
If you dare to mention this again,

40
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,050
don't blame me for disregarding our affection as colleagues.

41
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:44,490
Okay, okay.

42
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,370
Also, help me pass my order.

43
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,990
From now on, in the delegation,

44
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,690
anyone who dares to recklessly discuss

45
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,190
the matter of Marquis Changqing and Ruyi again

46
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,900
will be my enemy.

47
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,500
Okay.

48
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,700
Yes.

49
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,140
Ruyi.

50
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,110
Why do you think Mr. Du thinks that way?

51
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,670
You saved his life before.

52
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,790
After you guys found me that day,

53
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:42,970
he also told me

54
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,420
that it's all thanks to your help.

55
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,230
To think I used to regard him

56
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,510
as a good person

57
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,620
because he guided me patiently.

58
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,030
It's one thing for Chief Clerk Du to be grateful to me

59
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:54,870
for saving his life.

60
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,840
It's another thing for a woman and a man to be together

61
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:59,190
and having to

62
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,270
depend on each other.

63
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,150
After all, this is what

64
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,730
they've been taught all along.

65
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,970
Didn't Zheng Qingyun also think

66
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,090
that you'd be subservient to him

67
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,210
once you two were intimate?

68
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,150
There are very few men in this world

69
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,300
who're like Ning Yuanzhou.

70
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,470
Then, Ruyi,

71
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,110
since Yuanzhou is so defensive of you

72
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,390
in front of others,

73
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,430
can you stop being mad at him?

74
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,480
No man has ever

75
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,190
defended me like he did.

76
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,710
I'm very grateful.

77
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,800
But there are still some things

78
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,330
that we need to think through

79
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,380
before we know if we can go on.

80
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,260
Then... I'll think with you.

81
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,290
Can you think it through with your little head?

82
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,380
Of course.

83
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,940
Although my head is small,

84
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,610
I've a big brain.

85
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,540
But Ruyi,

86
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,220
do you know?

87
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,180
Yuanzhou is actually really pitiful.

88
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,790
In the past two days,

89
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,030
he's been sitting there alone

90
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,630
and drinking to drown his sorrows.

91
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,770
And when he talked to us,

92
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,220
he was always distracted.

93
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,830
You just said you've a big brain.

94
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,760
Now you’re trying to trick me with a sympathy ploy.

95
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,320
I know Ning Yuanzhou.

96
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,030
If he really wants to drink alone,

97
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,110
he wouldn't let anyone find out.

98
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,810
No matter how upset he is,

99
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,070
he wouldn't let it affect his work.

100
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,220
Because I'm the same.

101
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,610
Tell me.

102
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,090
If you know each other so well,

103
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,110
why do you still have such dissensions?

104
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,570
Because we love each other sincerely.

105
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,630
If we want to be together for a long time,

106
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,750
we can't just casually

107
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,820
skip over one problem after another.

108
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,180
I see.

109
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,450
But Ruyi,

110
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,110
I still want you two

111
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,070
to have your own baby.

112
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,970
It'll have your face

113
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,290
and Yuanzhou's eyes.

114
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,810
It'll be so beautiful and fun.

115
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,650
I love that.

116
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,270
What?

117
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,990
Ning.

118
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,250
Why are you so stubborn at the critical moment?

119
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,020
I heard everything.

120
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,659
It's not a big problem between you two.

121
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,940
To smooth things out with a lady,

122
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,540
you've to pander to her needs.

123
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,580
When she gets over her anger,

124
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,320
peace will be restored.

125
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,630
It's not an issue about pandering to her needs.

126
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,080
We're not at odds either.

127
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,390
It's just that if we want our relationship to last,

128
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,700
we both need to think things through.

129
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:18,320
This is the greatest respect for our relationship.

130
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,100
Respect?

131
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,530
Love is not business,

132
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,580
where you've to be irreconciliable with each other like enemies.

133
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,880
The most important thing for two people being together

134
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,990
is to abandon the sadness and distrust

135
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:31,910
in your hearts.

136
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,230
Only then can you last long.

137
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,789
If you keep torturing yourself like this,

138
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,429
don't blame me for making my move

139
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:39,490
without considering our brotherhood.

140
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,559
You?

141
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:49,010
Li Tongguang is more powerful,

142
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,710
younger, more handsome,

143
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,880
and more love-struck than you.

144
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:53,910
If Ruyi didn't fall for him,

145
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,330
what makes you think she'll fall for you?

146
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,080
So you do know that Li Tongguang is powerful,

147
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,520
younger, more handsome,

148
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,830
and more love-struck than you.

149
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,770
You always say that Beauty is ignorant of worldly affairs

150
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,840
and don't understand love.

151
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,470
I think you're worse than her.

152
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,990
With love,

153
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,490
once you figure it out,

154
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,160
you'll progress at a tremendous pace.

155
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,630
To put it bluntly,

156
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,670
every man in our delegation

157
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,700
is more caring than you.

158
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,010
As for me,

159
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,810
I know gentle tricks best.

160
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,980
If you don't cherish it,

161
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,310
you'll see how persistence yields success.

162
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:37,950
Don't you dare!

163
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,790
Why not?

164
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,020
I dare.

165
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,560
I dare.

166
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,220
Don't forget

167
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,780
about Jin Meiniang.

168
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,050
She won't let you off.

169
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,750
What?

170
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,650
You're personally going to see Marquis Changqing?

171
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,310
Yes.

172
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,700
And I want to go now.

173
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,290
It’s rude to not reciprocate.

174
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,130
After all, Marquis Changqing

175
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,290
has visited me twice.

176
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,500
Now that I'm getting better,

177
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,170
I should visit his residence.

178
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,740
Don’t worry.

179
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,290
Marquis Changqing is prone to suspicion.

180
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,940
He'd probably find an excuse to refuse this meeting.

181
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:44,530
If so,

182
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,520
I can also find out the backgrounds

183
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,080
of those people in the State of An along the way.

184
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,210
It's inappropriate.

185
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,260
Your Highness.

186
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,890
You should have discussed with me beforehand.

187
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,820
How could you act on your own?

188
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,410
You didn't discuss with me just now

189
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,800
before you had a secret discussion with Mr. Ning.

190
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,670
No matter how many mistakes I've made before,

191
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,770
please don’t forget

192
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,700
that I'm

193
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,400
the emperor's envoy that An people want.

194
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:23,450
Therefore,

195
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,860
from now on, no matter what important matters there are,

196
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,550
please don't bypass me.

197
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:33,890
On behalf of the emperor

198
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,570
and myself,

199
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,130
I thank you...

200
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,350
Your Highness, I don't deserve it.

201
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,420
I'll keep your order

202
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,350
in mind.

203
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,070
Miss Ruyi.

204
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,860
I was thoughtless

205
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,270
and made a big mistake.

206
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,070
Please forgive me.

207
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,050
It was not my decision.

208
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,670
It was Her Highness's impromptu idea.

209
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,040
I'll escort you there.

210
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,090
Mr. Ning.

211
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,760
Mr. Du.

212
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:18,450
An people have come to bully us repeatedly.

213
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,880
Don't you want to teach them a lesson?

214
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,330
I...

215
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,450
I'll go with you.

216
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,370
I planned to

217
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,800
take you to see Marquis Changqing tomorrow.

218
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,580
It’s better to go now.

219
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:35,890
We can surprise them

220
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,210
and also find out their real identities.

221
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:39,780
Okay.

222
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,400
Then are you going?

223
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:45,190
Yes.

224
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,040
But I'm a princess now.

225
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,030
It's not suitable for me to casually meet other men.

226
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,090
I'll wait for you in the carriage.

227
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,600
I'll protect Her Highness.

228
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,150
Did you talk to Boss?

229
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,320
I just persuaded Ruyi.

230
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,560
I haven't found a chance yet.

231
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:03,970
It doesn’t matter.

232
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,850
After making a scene at Marquis Changqing’s turf,

233
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,410
Boss Ning will be happy

234
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,010
and we'll have a chance.

235
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,410
Marquis Changqing is so annoying.

236
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,710
Ruyi and Yuanzhou were on good terms,

237
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,380
but they quarreled because he came.

238
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:23,970
Yesterday, when An people came,

239
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,930
our response was hasty and disorganized.

240
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,410
If we can't regain our magnificence today,

241
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,250
when we arrive at the State of An,

242
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,440
they'll definitely look down on us.

243
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,010
So today, we must be strictly disciplined

244
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,730
and move swiftly.

245
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,890
Defend His Highness to the death!

246
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:40,810
Understand?

247
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:41,970
Yes!

248
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:43,880
Let's go.

249
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,010
Please.

250
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,960
Did you really drink so much that your old injury flared up?

251
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,130
No, don't listen to their nonsense.

252
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm fine.

253
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,010
I...

254
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,410
When did we talk nonsense?

255
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,830
Be understanding.

256
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,170
He can't blame the heavens, so he's blaming others.

257
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:08,600
[He County Office]

258
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,740
[Wu]

259
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,590
Please inform him

260
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,460
that Prince Li of Wu

261
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,330
is here to pay his respects.

262
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,730
Marquis.

263
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,410
Now that he's recovered and is in good spirits,

264
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,000
they want to make a scene and regain their prestige.

265
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,650
They came all the way to our doorstep.

266
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:57,570
If we don't meet them,

267
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:00,210
it'll make us seem weaker.

268
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,210
Go and deal with them.

269
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,350
Tell them I have work to do.

270
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:06,570
No.

271
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,210
Just tell them I went to a nearby restaurant to relax.

272
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,370
Leave them hanging for over an hour.

273
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,290
It's not too late to meet them then.

274
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,470
Yes.

275
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,060
[He County Office]

276
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,510
What a huge scene.

277
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,790
Looks like Prince Li

278
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,310
recovered quickly.

279
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:46,930
Why?

280
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,230
Do you wish I stayed sick?

281
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,900
It was just a joke.

282
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,460
I'm very heartened

283
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,500
that you've recovered.

284
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,089
Please come in.

285
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,210
Dare I ask you something?

286
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:13,369
The emperor's envoy of Wu came here personally

287
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,060
and should be welcomed grandly.

288
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,609
Don't tell me the officials of the State of An's Honglu Temple

289
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,329
neglect their duties to this extent

290
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:21,970
that they can't even distinguish one's social status?

291
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,410
I'm the emperor's envoy.

292
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,450
Those who insult me

293
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:39,910
will be killed without mercy.

294
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,070
Your Highness, please calm down.

295
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,130
Vice Minister.

296
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,170
The marquis is inferior to the prince.

297
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,220
He should be present to welcome the prince.

298
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,730
Where is the Commissioner for Presentations?

299
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,150
Marquis Changqing hasn't returned from his feast outside.

300
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,070
I’ve sent someone to inform him.

301
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,620
Please wait a moment, Your Highness.

302
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,770
His Highness came to visit you personally,

303
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,630
but you're delaying the meeting with excuses.

304
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,390
Is there really something wrong?

305
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:27,490
Mr. Du,

306
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:31,100
why do your words sound familiar?

307
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,450
This was what Vice Minister said previously at the posthouse.

308
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,850
I'm just returning what was told to us.

309
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:42,210
Marquis Changqing's just arrived in He County for his duties,

310
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,410
but he rushed to go out to wine and dine.

311
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,000
He sure is a talented but loose young general.

312
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,730
But Marquis Changqing himself said

313
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,250
that He County is inauspicious.

314
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,580
He'd better be careful

315
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,140
not to catch any disease from his looseness.

316
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,890
Since it’s inconvenient for Marquis Changqing to meet,

317
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,280
I’ll come tomorrow.

318
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,420
After all,

319
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,280
he came to visit me twice.

320
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,910
He is deserving of me making another trip.

321
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:16,990
Goodbye.

322
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:18,980
Your Highness.

323
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,550
Your Highness. Your...

324
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,100
Send Your Highness back home.

325
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,390
Yes.

326
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,210
Ruyi.

327
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,910
How did I do?

328
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:41,730
Not bad.

329
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,620
He wanted to leave me out in the cold,

330
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,130
so I had to hurt him.

331
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,980
Sorry, I forgot he's your disciple.

332
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,180
It's okay.

333
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,410
You responded quickly and appropriately.

334
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,020
You've done a good job.

335
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,080
Did I improve again?

336
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,590
Don't be smug.

337
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:33,870
Master.

338
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:41,810
Marquis.

339
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,980
I didn't mean to be rude just now...

340
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:44,560
Leave.

341
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:49,970
Marquis.

342
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,700
Have you found out Princess Huyang's background?

343
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,530
Prince De of Wu does have a daughter, Princess Huyang.

344
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,370
But recently, there have been many casualties 
in the Scarlet Guards branches in Wu.

345
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,060
The princess' appearance

346
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,410
and whether she's a female official couldn't be confirmed.

347
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,600
But since Prince Li left Wu Capital,

348
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,400
this princess has been by his side at all times

349
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:07,730
and taking good care of him.

350
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:08,980
They're referred to as siblings,

351
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:10,530
but are actually master and disciple.

352
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,780
Master and disciple?

353
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,080
Marquis.

354
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,650
How is he qualified to be Master's disciple?

355
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,330
Marquis, didn't you say

356
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,750
she isn't Left Emissary Ren?

357
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:25,580
She...

358
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,090
Regardless of her identity, I won't allow it.

359
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,570
In this world,

360
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,290
my master can only treat me well.

361
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,980
Send my order to He County's general, Wu Qian,

362
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,590
to consolidate the army camp.

363
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,560
I'll bring my distinguished guests there tomorrow.

364
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:51,560
Yes.

365
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,610
Write the invitation immediately.

366
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,460
Tell them I'm immensely sorry

367
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:57,570
that I couldn't welcome them today.

368
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:58,930
Tomorrow morning,

369
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,330
we'll hold a banquet at the drill ground to make amends.

370
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,760
Specify for Prince Li and Princess Huyang to attend.

371
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,420
[Invitation]

372
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,410
A banquet at the drill ground.

373
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,480
He even specifically asked for Miss Ruyi to attend.

374
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,830
He's up to no good.

375
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,130
I was going out for a walk.

376
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:51,370
Oh, right.

377
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,770
I'm here to return the bottle.

378
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:55,970
Thank you.

379
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,120
Oh, and this.

380
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:08,610
Take a look.

381
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,640
Come in.

382
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:29,140
Sit.

383
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:38,370
This fellow must have been

384
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,330
hurt by what Ying said tonight.

385
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,410
He's holding back all his strength now

386
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,900
to regain his dignity tomorrow.

387
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:48,800
Then...

388
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,130
will you go?

389
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:54,420
Yes.

390
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,510
Otherwise, we don't know what he'll do to Ying.

391
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,130
He has been somewhat eccentric since he was a kid.

392
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,010
Is your cough better?

393
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,160
Yes.

394
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:11,810
Thank you for the medicine.

395
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,150
What's wrong?

396
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,800
Nothing.

397
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,360
It's because of Ten-Day Qianji?

398
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,840
You haven't taken the antidote for this episode yet.

399
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:38,830
It's okay.

400
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,110
We were delayed by a couple of days

401
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,180
because of Zheng Qingyun's matter.

402
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:43,240
Don't worry.

403
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,280
When we get to Junzhou in the State of An,

404
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,350
we'll get the antidote.

405
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:49,650
Zhang Song is such a scumbag.

406
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,450
He knew that anything could happen

407
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,420
in the journey.

408
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,550
If you didn't go and get it,

409
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,290
couldn't he have sent someone to deliver it here?

410
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,010
I'm not under his control

411
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:02,690
and couldn't arrive on time.

412
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,590
So, he's making me suffer.

413
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,240
People like him

414
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:11,610
are always like this.

415
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,410
That's why you want to stay away from the world.

416
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,960
Nothing else.

417
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,650
You know?

418
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,260
I’ve long been tired of the strife in Wu court.

419
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,880
When I pretended to die on the battlefield,

420
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:35,990
I made up my mind

421
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,780
not to waste my life fighting for power and benefits

422
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,090
for those in power.

423
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,400
I also don't want to be their pawn anymore.

424
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,790
In the whirlpool of state politics,

425
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,590
it's all about seizing ranks, being imprisoned or exiled,

426
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,690
and living perfunctorily in the end.

427
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,850
My heart has long turned cold.

428
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:00,440
I don't want to get involved in other things.

429
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,680
I just want to find a place

430
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,270
to spend the rest of my life quietly.

431
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,780
But don't get me wrong.

432
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,220
I'm not telling you this to make you pity me

433
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,250
and deceive you to live in seclusion with me.

434
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:18,810
I know.

435
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,430
I can't be abducted by you

436
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:22,980
easily either.

437
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,850
I also know

438
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,490
that you're seriously injured.

439
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,350
But you act like nothing happened

440
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:39,540
in order to complete this mission.

441
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,300
On one end, you're joking around

442
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:43,920
with everyone as before,

443
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,150
while on the other end, you're trying to hide

444
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,180
the scar that has never healed.

445
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,340
You like me

446
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,360
not only because I'm strong,

447
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,890
but also because we suffer

448
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,550
the same pain.

449
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,850
We can seek solace in each other.

450
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,100
You don't have to hide it.

451
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,830
I just want to tell you

452
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,080
that your heart isn't cold.

453
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,540
Your heart has always been warm.

454
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,810
You don’t like the strife in Wu court

455
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,050
and you're disappointed by Zhao Ji's betrayal.

456
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,730
But when you heard that Ying was in danger

457
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,750
and that the Heaven Path comrades were wronged,

458
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,560
you complied with Zhang Song right away.

459
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:37,010
Even if Ten-Day Qianji triggered extreme pain,

460
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,050
you wouldn’t tell others.

461
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,080
You keep saying you don't want to meddle in others' business,

462
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,490
but you've been concerned about Yuan Lu's illness,

463
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,590
the people's livelihoods,

464
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:50,010
and facilitating Ying's growth.

465
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:51,890
Is this someone

466
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,530

I went out yesterday

00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,490
and you had a wasted trip.

I'm really sorry.

I'm holding a special banquet today.

529
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,570
Thank you for your attendance, Your Highness.

530
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,460
Have you thought about

531
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,200
my proposal last time?

532
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:19,170
Princess, are you anxious?

Don't worry.

I'll give you a satisfactory answer.

Please wait for the good news.

537
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,600
Your Highness. Princess.

538
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:31,910
Please.

539
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:33,820
Please.

540
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,260
Prince Li, can you understand this?

541
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,200
Forgive my ignorance.

542
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:52,730
I only know that this person is dressed in 
the attire of your country's Shazhong Tribe.

543
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,340
I'm not sure

544
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,050
about the others.

545
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,520
They're Beipan people.

546
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,800
They live in the north of the mountains and passes.

547
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:03,010
They've frequently appeared at the border for the past few centuries.

548
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,230
The An and Wu people are terrified of them.

549
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,910
The late emperor of the previous dynasty also died in the commotion of battle.

550
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,860
That's why your country's ancestors succeeded in stealing the state

551
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,820
and becoming self-sufficient.

552
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,910
Marquis Changqing, you're really familiar with

553
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,380
my state's history.

554
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,870
Maybe it's because you miss your father.

555
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:45,610
Where's your father's hometown?

556
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,960
There might be your father's compatriots

557
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,210
among my followers.

558
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,760
Your Highness, you don't know Beipan people,

559
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,820
but you should know these people.

560
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,110
Bring them here!

561
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,180
[Wu Qian, general of He County]

562
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:12,810
Move along!

563
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:14,710
Hurry up.

564
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:15,200
Go!

565
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,290
Move! Hurry up!

566
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:20,130
Hurry up!

567
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,100
Move along! Hurry up!

568
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,130
Hurry up!

569
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,700
Move along! Hurry up!

570
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,120
General Yuan.

571
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:35,890
Tao Jian.

572
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:37,570
Hurry up!

573
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,890
Chief Ning.

574
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:40,760
I'm incompetent

575
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,020
and disgraced Liudao Hall.

576
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,320
I've let you down.

577
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,610
[Tao Jian, calvary soldier of Liudao Hall's Human Path]

578
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,900
I failed to protect Chai Ming.

579
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,770
I could only watch them be...

580
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,170
Where were Chai Ming and the others buried?

581
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:00,640
The river near Guideyuan.

582
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:15,900
Qian Zhao.

583
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:34,880
Since you're old friends,

584
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,310
you should

585
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:38,449
serve the wine to our guests.

586
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:41,050
Kneel!

587
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:45,840
Take it.

588
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,170
No?

589
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,469
Fine, I'll hit you until you take it.

590
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:51,480
Are you going to take it or not?

591
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:52,780
Take it.

592
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:53,980
Take it!

593
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:56,820
How dare you hide?

594
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:57,640
Take it.

595
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:02,240
Are you going to take it or not?

596
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:02,980
Enough!

597
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,030
Marquis Changqing.

598
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:13,280
Since you've been advocating for the peace talks,
why are you doing this?

599
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,430
Your Highness, weren't you very majestic yesterday?

600
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,220
Why are you so easily startled now?

601
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,400
I just asked them to make a toast.

602
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,980
I didn't do anything else.

603
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,030
Take it!

604
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:34,510
You...

605
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,190
Are you going to take it or not?

606
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:11,970
General Wu.

607
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,700
There are also your country's soldiers imprisoned in Wu.

608
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:16,360
Do you want

609
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,650
your compatriots to be

610
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,050
humiliated like them?

611
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,470
If you fight for Wu,

612
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:29,280
you're the heroes of Wu.

613
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:31,570
How dare we

614
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,820
let the heroes serve wine to us?

615
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:41,950
General Yuan.

616
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:11,980
Let me make a toast to all the heroes!

617
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,610
Cheers!

618
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:19,770
Cheers!

619
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,040
Marquis Changqing.

620
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,050
We’ve finished the wine.

621
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,470
Can we let them go back to rest?

622
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:58,310
Yes.

623
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,050
But their service was poor.

624
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:03,230
Take them away

625
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:04,930
and give them 10 whips each.

626
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,450
Enough.

627
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,000
You're being more and more ruthless.

628
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:22,910
Marquis Changqing.

629
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,940
Is this how your master taught you?

630
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,100
Shut up!

631
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:31,810
Sister.

632
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:34,740
Do you think you're qualified to comment freely

633
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,180
just because you look like her?

634
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,010
It's impolite not to reciprocate.

635
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:51,960
If you're that capable,

636
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:54,140
kill me.

637
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,410
A banquet set up to torture people with dirty tricks.

638
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,210
It's absolutely ridiculous.

639
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:25,180
His Highness' delegation

640
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,920
is nothing more than you releasing our emperor

641
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,870
and us paying.

642
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,850
The deal has to be fair

643
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,210
for the show to go on.

644
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:32,610
If you don’t want to talk,

645
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,060
then forget it.

646
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,280
Let's go.

647
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,220
Stop them!

648
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,810
Don't move! Don't move!

649
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:54,640
Prince Li.

650
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,080
Was what Princess Huyang said just now

651
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:01,000
representative of your delegation's intention?

652
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,670
Her words

653
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:05,140
are representative of what I want.

654
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:06,930
And what I want

655
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,360
is what everyone in the State of Wu wants.

656
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,480
Very well.

657
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,960
When the two states of An and Wu meet in battle again

658
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,000
and there are corpses strewn all over for countless miles,

659
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,920
that'll be all thanks to Prince Li.

660
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:21,170
Marquis Changqing, are you refusing to negotiate again?

661
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:27,480
If you fail your duty as the Commissioner for Presentations,

662
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,490
I'm afraid everyone will remember

663
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,830
your good reputation as a son of a paramour.

664
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:40,940
Marquis.

665
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,020
Whoever dares to stop us today

666
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,170
will be Wu's enemy.

667
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,360
Let's go!

668
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,640
Did you see it clearly?

669
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,750
Is she...

670
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,390
Come back with me first.

671
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,130
You don't have to refuse it.

672
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,090
You're heroes of Wu.

673
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:47,950
Naturally, you're worthy of His Highness' royal carriage.

674
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:48,500
Yes.

675
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,080
When we get back to the posthouse,

676
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,030
I'll give up my superior room to you

677
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,050
for your recuperation.

678
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,150
Please.

679
00:41:58,930 --> 00:41:59,490
Be careful.

680
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,410
Your Highness, please.

681
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,260
That little bastard.

682
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:20,900
It's been years since I've seen him

683
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,340
and he's getting worse.

684
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:24,130
He didn't keep in mind

685
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:25,390
those calm down techniques I taught him.

686
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:27,450
He only knows how to assert his authority in strange ways.

687
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:29,800
We found out that he actually advocates for the peace talk,

688
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:31,070
but he suddenly changed his mind.

689
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,140
I think he's acting abnormally after seeing you.

690
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:34,420
I believe he'll calm down

691
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:35,500
in no time

692
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:37,390
and regard the delegation in a proper manner.

693
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:40,770
When I came over here,

694
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,780
I ran into an old friend of Scarlet Guards.

695
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:44,350
Who is it?

696
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,940
Liu Li, the maid who used to serve me.

697
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,880
I'm not sure if she recognized me

698
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:51,210
and I don't know

699
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:52,630
if she'd tell others.

700
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,580
Is she still in Scarlet Guards?

701
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:56,370
I'm not sure.

702
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,470
It's been quite a few days

703
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,350
since the incident at Qingfeng Temple.

704
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,950
I believe the Scarlet Guards headquarters has already found out about it.

705
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:04,750
Could she be the one the Scarlet Guards sent

706
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,170
to confirm your identity?

707
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,090
Probably.

708
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,580
But she wasn't wearing the Scarlet Guards' attire just now.

709
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,920
She went straight to Li Tongguang.

710
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:15,950
According to Meiniang,

711
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,970
Li Tongguang and the current Scarlet Guards

712
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,230
have barely any ties.

713
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,210
We should be more careful.

714
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,630
Let's go back to the posthouse first.

715
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:31,640
Tell me.

716
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,490
Is she Master?

717
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:37,930
Impossible.

718
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:41,730
Her gaze

719
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:43,800
and her back...

720
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,100
They look exactly like Master's.

721
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:52,110
Her appearance

722
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:55,260
is quite similar to Lord Ren indeed.

723
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:58,490
But before she met with danger at Yaoyue Pavilion,

724
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:00,290
she was seriously injured.

725
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:01,640
She was injured here.

726
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,130
It was a very deep wound.

727
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,060
When I was serving her,

728
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,150
I heard it myself from the doctor who stitched it

729
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,050
that even if the divine doctor Hua Tuo were alive,

730
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,020
he couldn't remove that scar.

731
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:13,780
But I saw clearly just now

732
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,150
that there was nothing

733
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,800
on Princess Huyang's neck.

734
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:26,680
You're lying to me.

735
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:33,590
There's someone who looks so much like her.

736
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,520
There must be a way.

737
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:42,110
You...

738
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,010
Go teach her martial arts.

739
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:45,960
Go find the Scarlet Guards' clothing.

740
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:47,400
Help me turn her into my master!

741
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:48,770
Do you hear me?

742
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:50,800
Do you hear me?

743
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:52,690
Yes.

744
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:54,110
Yes.
