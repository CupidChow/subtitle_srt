[Episode 24]

4
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,770
The Scarlet Guards are about the same.

5
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:53,610
Just now,

6
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,810
I killed the Left Emissary that tried to assassinate Jiu,

7
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,250
but what he said before he died

8
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,420
depressed me.

9
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,530
He said he worked for the First Prince

10
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,050
just to survive,

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,539
because His Majesty has never trusted the Scarlet Guards.

12
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,850
Even if one becomes a high-level guard,

13
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,730
one can only do it for two or three years

14
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,110
before being replaced.

15
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,350
I realized they're right.

16
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,170
I was only the Left Emissary

17
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,850
for around one year.

18
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,050
They're actually the same kind of people.

19
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,750
My emperor

20
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,400
is impulsive and reckless.

21
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,020
He trusted the eunuchs and personally led the Tianmenguan Battle

22
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,970
to seize power from Zhang Song.

23
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,560
He also wanted to prove to the people

24
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,620
that he is a ruthless emperor.

25
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,130
As for the King of An,

26
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,010
he clearly knew

27
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,340
that Beipan had infiltrated Tianmenguan,

28
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,810
but he still ignored it.

29
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,480
He only thought about how to conquer other states.

30
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,079
What should we do to stop them?

31
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,329
Should we sneak into the pagoda

32
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,610
and force your emperor to write the name clearing edict?

33
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,370
Ying can't handle him,

34
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,420
but we won't have any trouble.

35
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:40,480
No.

36
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,840
We have to wait until Ying meets the emperor of An

37
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,570
and checks the situation there.

38
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,360
The Yong'an Pagoda is heavily guarded.

39
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,930
If he can be released immediately after we hand over the gold,

40
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,079
we won't have to take the risk.

41
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,900
Also, I believe

42
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,170
Jin Meiniang has already spread the news

43
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,290
to the State of Chu.

44
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:05,710
In a few days,

45
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,020
the State of Chu will send a letter to question the emperor of An

46
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,930
about why there are few troops at Tianmenguan,

47
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,790
while troops are stationed at the border of Chu.

48
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,130
Once he knows that the State of Chu is on guard,

49
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,680
he will probably stop temporarily.

50
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,490
Can you send people from the Liudao Hall

51
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,650
to send a fake message?

52
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,610
Say that the person who leaked the attack plan

53
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,050
was under the First Prince.

58

There's no reason why he should be safe.

that officials had stomachs like this

00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,690
How can I wear them?

191
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,030
I'm carefully selecting a gift for you.

192
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,100
If I were you, I would be so happy.

193
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,550
I can also choose one for you.

194
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,490
You can,

195
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,880
but these are women's stuff.

196
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,850
I'll ask you to pick for me next time.

197
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,490
Let me choose for you this time.

198
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,970
Take a look at this one.

199
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:32,610
Look at this.

200
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,010
Sir.

201
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,130
Forgive me for not recognizing you.

202
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,360
Please come to the back garden.

203
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:02,760
This way, please.

204
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,620
Madam, what's going on?

205
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,090
Tell me. What happened?

206
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,120
The tiger head hung in this shop

207
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,970
is a common decoration in the Shadong Tribe.

208
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,330
Empress Zhaojie was a noble lady from the Shadong Tribe.

209
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,010
In order to make things easier,

210
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,170
she arranged for me to take the identity of her niece.

211
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,390
When tribesmen meet,

212
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,480
they can make this gesture and report their clan

213
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,680
to make it clear to each other.

214
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,380
I see.

215
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,300
What about the bead?

216
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,210
Meiniang gave me

217
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,790
the silver bead.

218
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,640
She was afraid that I wouldn't have enough money here,

219
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,940
so she prepared some for me.

220
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:43,920
It's not much.

221
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,100
Each one can only be exchanged

222
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,790
for 50 taels of gold at the Jinsha Pavilion.

223
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,840
Fifty taels?

224
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,140
Madam, you are really rich.

225
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,200
Official,

226
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,120
the An Capital is my territory, after all.

227
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:02,490
You're right.

228
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,490
Madam, Official, this way.

229
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,510
Are you really choosing jewelry for me?

230
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,520
They have more than jewelry here.

231
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,190
Welcome.

232
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:20,660
How is it?

233
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,330
A scholarly gentleman.

234
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,610
I don't think the color suits you.

235
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,750
Didn't you choose this one?

236
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,140
I chose another one.

237
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,570
However, I think this color

238
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:30,570
suits Shisan quite well.

239
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,740
I'll buy it for him.

240
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,290
How about this? I'm like a cultivator.

241
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,210
Change into the other one.

242
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,390
This is okay. Change into another one.

243
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,920
This is better than the other one just now.

244
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,420
Change again?

245
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,010
Is this okay?

246
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,050
I like it.

247
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:51,530
This color is too exaggerated.

248
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:52,250
It looks nice.

249
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,270
No,

250
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,420
I'm the chief.

251
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,900
-How can I be dressed like a groom?
-This is the one.

252
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:00,860
You're so domineering.

253
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:07,980
Try it.

254
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,540
Lower your head.

255
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:18,980
A bit lower.

256
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,240
Satisfied?

257
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,790
Turn around.

258
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:44,920
Sir.

259
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:45,850
Yes.

260
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,920
Bring the things I chose

261
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,040
and this to Jinsha Pavilion.

262
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,030
They will know how to deal with it.

263
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,530
Yes.

264
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:11,830
Official.

265
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,550
Let's go.

266
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,330
Yes, dear.

267
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,610
It's quite hard for Official Gu.

268
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,970
It's tiring to try on clothes.

269
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,970
I'm beat.

270
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,530
It's good that you're tired.

271
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,490
Men

272
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,980
love to take a girl to shop.

273
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,140
It seems like they're doting on her,

274
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,600
but they're actually just treating her as a doll

275
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,020
to make themselves happy.

276
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,330
Today,

277
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,530
you get a taste of it too.

278
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:53,410
Wait,

279
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,740
you sound very experienced.

280
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,160
You have a problem?

281
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,880
I dare not.

282
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,050
You're quite familiar with jewelry too.

283
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,200
It must not be the first time either.

284
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,980
I used to be a jewelry trader.

285
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,650
I have to know this,

286
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,050
but it's really my first time picking jewelry

287
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,390
for the woman I love.

288
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,440
Official Gu,

289
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,500
have you really only been a jewelry trader

290
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,500
and nothing else?

291
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,710
Such as?

292
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,530
Such as

293
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:37,850
a paramour

294
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,230
or a male consort?

295
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,940
No way.

296
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,890
How could I have done that?

297
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,970
Am I even qualified with my looks?

298
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,370
You're the only one who dotes on me.

299
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:53,340
Really?

300
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:55,650
Of course.

301
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,830
When you changed into the new clothes just now,

302
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,420
you did seem like a handsome man.

303
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,270
I'm just cooperating with you,

304
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:05,210
my wife.

305
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,250
Stop talking about me.

306
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,620
Do you like this hairpin?

307
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,480
Yes.

308
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,560
Why would I wear it if I don't like it?

309
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,090
I'm glad you like it.

310
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:20,490
Alright, Official Gu, I'll stop giving you a hard time.

311
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,070
Let's talk about something serious.

312
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:22,660
Okay.

313
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,880
I want to check the Second Prince’s mansion

314
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,260
and also help Empress Zhaojie visit him.

315
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,420
Ning, you're finally back.

316
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:36,880
What's wrong?

317
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:37,220
Wait.

318
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,210
New clothes?

319
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,490
New hairpin?

320
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,180
You two...

321
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,890
Where did you take her? Tell me.

322
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,510
Ignore him.

323
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:53,700
Let's go.

324
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,450
Amazing, you changed your entire look.

325
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,850
Do you think you can steal my title

326
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,210
as the most handsome man in the Liudao Hall?

327
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,109
I don't care about your title,

328
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,520
but

329
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:08,680
if you also have a beautiful companion,

330
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,000
you'll have someone to buy you clothes.

331
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:13,810
Ruyi.

332
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,490
We're leaving, Handsome Man.

333
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:23,810
One is ruthless and the other is even more ruthless.

334
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,690
Do you have to break one's heart like this?

335
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,030
I want a new hairpin too.

336
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,690
Buy one for me. I want one too.

337
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,230
Why is he so clingy?

338
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,450
Marquis, calm down.

339
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,640
I know.

340
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,480
I still need to work with Ning Yuanzhou,

341
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,980
but you know what?

342
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,700
Even if I already knew

343
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,180
that they were together,

344
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,530
when I see it with my own eyes,

345
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,140
it's still like a stab in the gut.

346
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,210
Let's return.

347
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:36,240
Halt!

348
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,410
Change the route. You're not allowed to go from here.

349
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,090
What's wrong?

350
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,200
Chief,

351
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,110
Scarlet Guards are blocking the way. They won't let us through.

352
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,050
Break through!

353
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:46,660
Yes.

354
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,140
How dare you!

355
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,150
How dare you stop Marquis Changqing’s carriage?

356
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:56,610
Lord,

357
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:59,130
I was ordered by Left Emissary Chen to set up a blockade,

358
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,100
but Marquis Changqing...

359
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,560
Mr. Deng,

360
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,070
I think I've said before

361
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,700
that, in my heart, there's only one Left Emissary of the Scarlet Guards.

362
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,930
I don't want to hear other surnames

363
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,880
after this title.

364
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,650
Marquis Changqing, do you want to disobey the imperial edict?

365
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,930
His Majesty said personally

366
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,460
that no one in court is allowed to mention that traitor's name.

367
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,490
Did I mention it?

368
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,290
Who is the traitor

369
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,240
that you're talking about it?

370
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:40,850
Can you tell me?

371
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:44,930
Marquis Changqing,

372
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,410
stop before it's too late.

373
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:55,270
I'm here specifically to pick a fight with you.

374
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,130
Someone attempted to kill me in He County.

375
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,930
Mr. Deng,

376
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,020
shouldn't you be clear

377
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:06,170
who the mastermind was?

378
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,310
Didn't you already send someone

379
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,620
to kill Chen Gui, the mastermind?

380
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,170
What else do you want?

381
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:22,370
[Those who hurt Marquis Changqing will die]

382
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,240
Didn’t you send someone to do this?

383
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,840
Take a guess.

384
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,010
Lord,

385
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,460
this person sneaked into our headquarters

386
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,770
without anyone knowing

387
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,530
and made it clear it was to avenge Marquis Changqing,

388
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,970
but Marquis Changqing seems to know nothing about it.

389
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,010
Could this person be

390
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,960
the one from before?

391
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,460
Greetings, Lord.

392
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,520
Right Emissary, you're finally back.

393
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,210
I'm sorry.

394
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,020
Who do you think did it?

395
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,450
I've been thinking hard along the way

396
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,610
since I received the message.

397
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:33,770
Too much nonsense.

398
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,430
Yes.

399
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,250
I believe the one

400
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,890
who killed the Left Emissary

401
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,290
was the Left Emissary himself.

402
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,400
The Left Emissary was out of his mind

403
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,010
and dared to collude with the Beipan people to assassinate Marquis Changqing.

404
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,260
Seeing that Marquis Changqing returned safely

405
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,570
and that you were ordered to enter the palace,

406
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:55,090
he probably thought the matter was exposed.

407
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,450
In order to protect the mastermind,

408
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,370
he decided to

409
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,350
put on such a show with his life.

410
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,150
This could confuse the investigation,

411
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:06,340
while also giving His Majesty the explanation of a suicide.

412
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,590
Right Emissary, you're very smart.

413
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:13,560
Alright.

414
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,820
I'll give you seven days

415
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,580
to find the mastermind.

416
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:23,630
Otherwise...

417
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,070
Yes.

418
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,590
The Scarlet Guards are full of these annoying women.

419
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:44,440
There was only one passable man

420
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,130
and he's gone now.

421
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:56,350
Gone.

422
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,650
What should I do?

423
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:09,970
Lord, don't panic.

424
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:11,410
At least the Commander

425
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,670
hasn't suspected the matter about Yue Sanniang

426
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:13,870
and the 3,000 taels of gold yet.

427
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,910
The assassination of Marquis Changqing

428
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,130
has nothing to do with us.

429
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,490
No, you don't understand.

430
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,420
That assassin could only be her.

431
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:24,490
Who?

432
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,920
The Scarlet Guards' Left Emissary from five years ago,

433
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,430
Ren Xin.

434
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,590
[Mansion of Marquis Changqing]

435
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,190
Master.

436
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,480
Thank you.

437
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:47,250
Thank you for avenging me.

438
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,310
I knew

439
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,520
I'm always

440
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,040
the most important one in your heart.

441
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:00,250
Master.

442
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:05,340
♫The east wind is the cruelest♫

443
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,430
Master, you are so nice.

444
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:09,470
♫It scatters this encounter♫

445
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,810
In the future, you must learn strategy,

446
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:17,310
♫Could that deja vu be a sign?♫

447
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:10,940
the art of war,

448
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,490
and knowledge.

449
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,190
If you also have a beautiful companion,

450
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:23,390
♫I don't know how many miles I have to go to find you♫

451
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,420
you'll have someone to buy you clothes.

452
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,900
But why are you so close to Ning Yuanzhou?

453
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,170
I carefully selected

454
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:31,880
♫I search for your eyes but can only see your back♫

455
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,550
those hairpins for such a long time,

456
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:42,070
♫I can't tell if this is just a dream♫

457
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,710
but all the hairpins

458
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:38,890
you wore

459
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,380
were the ones he gave you.

460
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:50,700
♫I don't want to wake up; I can't stop missing you♫

461
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,310
Master.

462
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:57,950
♫You're the one person I can never get over♫

463
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,530
Tell me.

464
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,990
Was it you or not?

465
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:06,480
♫On the fool's errand of forgetting you♫

466
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:01,720
Please

467
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,520
tell me if it was you.

468
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,760
You may leave.

469
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,930
I didn't know you were here. My apologies.

470
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:37,140
What brings you here at this hour?

471
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,450
I heard you came back safely.

472
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,930
Father asked me to bring you some gifts.

473
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,380
Duke Chu is very considerate.

474
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,070
I am very grateful.

475
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,650
Please tell the Duke

476
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:53,930
that I'll visit another day to thank him.

477
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:56,810
You're welcome.

478
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:07,980
When you were in He County that day,

479
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,610
did Beipan people really attack you?

480
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,030
Yes.

481
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,260
You're very reserved.

482
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:21,910
I'm asking on behalf of my father.

483
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,480
I personally don't want to know.

484
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,570
In a few days,

485
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,650
I will write a letter

486
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,130
and report the details to the Duke.

487
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,290
Is there anything else?

488
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,460
Li Tongguang, what do you mean?

489
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,540
Why are you so impatient?

490
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,890
You said you looked down on me last time.

491
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,210
I didn't argue with you about it.

492
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:40,690
Today, I brought gifts

493
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,690
and even dressed up.

494
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,290
I've shown you respect.

495
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,420
If Father hadn't said

496
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,210
that the marriage is already decided

497
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,920
and we must get along well for a long-term solution,

498
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:50,570
I wouldn't—

499
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:51,780
I'm very sorry.

500
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,150
Don't worry.

501
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,810
I'll pay my respects to the Duke tomorrow.

502
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:02,790
We can

503
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:05,290
put on our polite act at that time.

504
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:13,570
Li Tongguang,

505
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,650
if you still want a marriage alliance with the Shaxi Tribe,

506
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,510
you'd better be polite to me.

507
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,600
I ran into some issues

508
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:28,900
and I'm in a bad mood.

509
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,890
You're venting at me because you're in a bad mood?

510
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,270
Who do you take me for?

511
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,890
I'm tired of acting with you.

512
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,980
I'll go back today and tell my father

513
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:42,170
that you don't respect me.

514
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,330
You even bully me.

515
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,930
I don't agree to this marriage.

516
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,080
Fine, go ahead.

517
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,090
You're already in your twenties,

518
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,090
but you still haven't gotten married.

519
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:56,890
Do you really not know why?

520
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,710
It's not because you have high standards,

521
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,580
or because you come from a prominent family,

522
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:05,840
but because you like to play with swords all day.

523
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,610
Your father can't find

524
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:10,480
a son-in-law that's suitable

525
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,670
and also won't make His Majesty suspicious

526
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,860
for you to marry.

527
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,250
Do you think you will always be

528
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,980
the Shaxi Tribe's precious princess?

529
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:25,040
You're wrong.

530
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,350
Your brother won't like

531
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:32,210
a sister who fights for power with him every day.

532
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:33,930
Princess Jin Ming,

533
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:37,220
do you want to stay in the Duke's mansion

534
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:39,450
and make your father worry about your marriage

535
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,890
year after year?

536
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:42,970
Or are you

537
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,850
willing to put up with your sister-in-law's annoyance

538
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,240
and your brother turning against you?

539
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,530
Li Tongguang, you...

540
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:58,830
Princess,

541
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,320
I don't mean to give you a hard time,

542
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,930
but please don't take things for granted.

543
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:08,170
I'm not asking for much.

544
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,050
As long as

545
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,730
we act like a loving couple,

546
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:21,680
I promise

547
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,330
that after our marriage,

548
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,250
I'll let you manage the household affairs.

549
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,310
I won't interfere with your freedom.

550
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,690
Freedom?

551
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,390
What freedom?

552
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,360
The freedom

553
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,240
of finding a paramour

554
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,530
and having an illegitimate child?

555
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,200
Of course.

556
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,840
If you're willing,

557
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,650
you can have a dozen,

558
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,240
let alone just one.

559
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:01,770
In the future,

560
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,520
I'll personally pick one for you

561
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,330
as your husband

562
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,940
to ensure that they're all the best ones.

563
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:48,450
Princess.

564
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,070
Princess, slow down.

565
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,890
How can he treat me like this?

566
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,970
Don’t be angry, Princess.

567
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:59,540
If you want to get along with Marquis Changqing—

568
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:00,770
Get along with him?

569
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,450
I don't want to get along with him.

570
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:05,330
He's domineering, arrogant, and conceited.

571
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,410
What right does he have to look down on me?

572
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,010
He looks down on me!

573
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,480
Don't tell anyone about what happened today.

574
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,270
Lord,

575
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,760
the other signal is also ready.

576
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,850
These four positions are guarded by Scarlet Guards.

577
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,050
And here.

578
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,220
The defense here is too tight.

579
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:49,760
-We can't break through at all.
-Ruyi.

580
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,580
The Jinsha Sect suddenly contacted

581
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:52,570
our patrol outside

582
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:53,610
and asked me to send a message.

583
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,370
They want you to look southwestward.

584
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:05,290
What is that?

585
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,590
A secret signal of the Scarlet Guards.

586
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:13,280
Someone wants to meet me

587
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:16,110
at the Earth God Temple in the south of the city at midnight today.

588
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,530
They took the bait?

589
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,380
I purposely left the message in the Scarlet Guards

590
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:22,850
to lure her out.

591
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:24,240
It seems

592
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,420
that it's Jia Ling instead of Deng Hui.

593
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,490
Why?

594
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,470
This signal

595
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,530
was only used by our batch of White Sparrows.

596
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,080
It really is you,

597
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:12,650
Left Emissary Ren.

598
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,540
Don't you remember me?

599
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,070
I'm Lin Ji,

600
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:20,450
but now,

601
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:22,730
I'm the Right Emissary.

602
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,200
I changed my name to Jia Ling

603
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,620
because I didn't want anyone to ever call me

604
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:34,610
by the Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branches codename.

605
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:36,780
You asked me to come here

606
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,640
just to reminisce about the past?

607
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:41,220
I came alone

608
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,500
to confess something to you.

609
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:57,030
The person who betrayed the Wu Capital Branch to the Liudao Hall

610
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:59,090
and released the extermination order

611
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,680
was me.

612
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,250
I had no choice but to obey the superior's orders.

613
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:14,719
You mean

614
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,280
Deng Hui threatened you with your life

615
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,770
and forced you to betray dozens of your subordinates?

616
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,989
It was an oath.

617
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,199
If I didn't cut off my own escape route,

618
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,489
how would Deng Hui believe

619
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,380
that I was willing to submit to him?

620
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,020
You checked his records, right?

621
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:36,420
His father

622
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,630
was killed by a White Sparrow.

623
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:41,650
He hates the Scarlet Guards,

624
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:44,449
but His Majesty was afraid that the Scarlet Guards would be too powerful,

625
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,449
so he still sent Deng Hui to take charge of this place.

626
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,860
Xin, when he hinted at me

627
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,420
to give him 3,000 taels

628
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:52,860
of the gold for bribing Eunuch Hu

629
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,030
and kill the Wu Capital Branch to silence them,

630
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:58,190
I was terrified. I had to obey.

631
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:00,970
In the past,

632
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,890
it would have been fine since I was alone,

633
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,010
but now...

634
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,030
You're pregnant.

635
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,070
It's only been four months.

636
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:23,640
The Scarlet Guards prohibits women from having personal affairs,

637
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:24,880
so

638
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,990
I've been tying my belly

639
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,000
to hide it.

640
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:30,890
Enough.

641
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,690
You're just trying to move me emotionally.

642
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,290
You know

643
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,450
that I never kill pregnant women.

644
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,780
Not only that.

645
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,820
Do you know why His Majesty believes

646
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,660
you killed Empress Zhaojie?

647
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,490
It was Deng Hui.

648
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,300
At the time, he was the head of the cavalry camp.

649
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,090
He bribed

650
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:57,110
Empress Zhaojie's personal maid, Bi,

651
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:58,570
for her to testify

652
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:01,230
that it was your idea for Empress Zhaojie

653
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,010
to threaten His Majesty with suicide

654
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:05,600
to make him appoint the Second Prince as the crown prince.

655
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,670
That's why Empress Zhaojie went to Yaoyue Pavilion.

656
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,520
His Majesty believed that you sowed discord.

657
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:14,280
That's why he threw you in prison.

658
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:16,490
Impossible.

659
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:17,950
I don't believe it.

660
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,980
I swear on my unborn baby

661
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,080
that every word is true.

662
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:30,970
Xin, it's perfect timing.

663
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:34,290
His Majesty went out to the temple today.

664
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,070
The guards are from Scarlet Guards.

665
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,420
Come with me to expose Deng Hui

666
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,450
and clear your name, okay?

667
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:46,060
Which temple is His Majesty in?

668
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:47,790
The Nanda Temple.

669
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:02,490
Let's go this way.

670
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:04,890
You still don't believe me.

671
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,330
You think I'll ambush you?

672
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:07,890
Whatever.

673
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,470
The Nanda Temple is right ahead.

674
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,490
How did you discover something was amiss?

675
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,000
First,

676
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,640
the path I took you down just now

677
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,580
had oleander flowers on the side.

678
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:27,270
Pregnant women fear oleander the most,

679
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,480
but you didn't even try to avoid them.

680
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,040
It means you're not pregnant.

681
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:34,720
Second,

682
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,130
your story was so tragic,

683
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,270
but you forgot

684
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:42,530
that if you were just forced to kill the Wu Capital Branch,

685
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:45,080
you wouldn't have had to hunt me down.

686
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,530
You even used your trusted disciple Zhu Ji.

687
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:49,370
Third,

688
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,400
you were the one who sent people

689
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,810
to surround me outside Yaoyue Pavilion

690
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:56,330
and said you would leave me a complete corpse.

691
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:00,640
I never trust my enemy easily.

692
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:45,360
You pretended to choose another path earlier,

693
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:46,790
but this place

694
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:49,110
must be passed through to reach the Nanda Temple.

695
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:50,770
It's also the best place for an ambush.

696
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,510
You're as stupid as before.

697
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:57,260
You set a trap without any creativity.

698
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,530
But there's one thing different about me now.

699
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,910
I'm the Right Emissary now,

700
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,470
while you're alone.

701
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,720
Even if you are the best assassin

702
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,290
in the history of the Scarlet Guards,

703
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,410
I'll wear you down today.

704
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,480
Listen up, everyone.

705
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,410
Those who hurt her will be rewarded 20 taels.

706
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:24,610
The one who kills her will be rewarded 100 taels.

707
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,270
Why are you smiling?

708
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,490
She's smiling because you guessed incorrectly.

709
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:11,540
Are you okay?

710
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:16,500
Who are you?

711
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:19,370
I'm Ning Yuanzhou

712
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:20,910
from the Liudao Hall.

713
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:45,590
Nice to meet you.

714
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,300
You asked the chief of the Liudao Hall to help you.

715
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,290
Ren Xin,

716
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,180
haven't you always been solitary

717
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,700
and unwilling to trust anyone?

718
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:01,130
People change.

719
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,060
You've changed.

720
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,220
Naturally, I've changed too.

721
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,930
[Some time before]

722
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,810
You always say I like to act alone.

723
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:29,040
This time,

724
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:31,730
come with me, okay?

725
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:38,770
Okay.

726
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:45,860
Attack!

727
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:04,490
♫They stab me in the back but I'll come back stronger♫

728
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,960
♫My roar shakes the ground when I wield my sword♫

729
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:12,200
♫They say I have no future but I'll rock the world♫

730
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:15,110
♫The sky is burning♫

731
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:19,030
♫They stab me in the back but I'll come back stronger♫

732
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:22,500
♫My roar shakes the ground when I wield my sword♫

733
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:26,730
♫They say I have no future but I'll rock the world♫

734
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,690
♫The sky is burning♫

735
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,650
♫There is no right or wrong♫
