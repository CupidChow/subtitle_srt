00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,470
Duke, look.

6
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,430
Look. It's His Majesty.

7
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,170
His Majesty.

8
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,250
How dare she?

9
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:26,850
Ren Xin.

10
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,630
What do you want?

11
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,190
Everyone,

12
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,870
I'm Ren Xin, the previous Left Emissary of Scarlet Guards.

13
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,480
Left Emissary Ren Xin?

14
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,829
Isn't she dead?

15
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,230
Yes.

16
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,329
Where is the historiographer?

17
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm Grand Councilor Wang Donglai

18
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,170
who's in charge of the Historiography Institute.

19
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,650
Ren Xin, do you know

20
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:02,190
the sentence for holding the emperor hostage is death?

21
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,230
Yes.

22
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,070
It's a major crime.

23
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:05,750
Yes.

24
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,070
Back then,

25
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,660
Li Sun accused me of killing Empress Zhaojie.

26
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,650
The penalty for that was death too.

27
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,980
I wasn't afraid five years ago.

28
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,910
Why would I be afraid now?

29
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,630
What should we do?

30
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,630
She… She…

31
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,660
Ren Xin.

32
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,000
There's no way out of this for you.

33
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,340
You can't escape.

34
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,190
But

35
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,010
if you can realize your mistake

36
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,670
and stop this…

37
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,079
Ren Xin, stop!

38
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,540
-Your Majesty! 
-Your Majesty!

39
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,690
Li Sun.

40
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,040
I want you to tell the officials

41
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,720
and the historiographer

42
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,190
the true cause

43
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,950
of Empress Zhaojie's death.

44
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,120
Empress Zhaojie

45
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,020
died in a big fire.

46
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,680
Is there something we don't know about the late empress's death?

47
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,060
What happened back then?

48
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,630
Do you think

49
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,360
His Majesty has said that

50
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,830
because I'm holding a sword to his throat?

51
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,470
Read these.

52
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,590
They're imperial diaries

53
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:41,560
and copies of the coroner's report from the Imperial Hospital.

54
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,130
They clearly state

55
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,370
that the late empress died of suffocation in a fire.

56
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,370
His Majesty knew the cause of her death

57
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,980
but still convicted me

58
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,390
of killing Empress Zhaojie.

59
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,690
Why is that?

60
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,460
Don't pretend to be so surprised.

61
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,990
Back then, Empress Zhaojie found out

62
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,560
that he conspired with Beipan.

63
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,380
So he set a fire to kill Her Majesty.

64
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,000
I don't believe

65
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,460
that no one in the court knows about it.

66
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,170
Beipan? Is that true?

67
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,110
Is that true?

68
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,330
Empress Zhaojie died

69
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,090
because she hated him for colluding with enemies

70
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,390
and didn't want to be the empress anymore.

71
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,190
She was also ashamed of being this scum's wife.

72
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,090
Ren Xin, even if you have grievances,

73
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,870
you can't hold His Majesty hostage!

74
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,120
-That's right. 
-After all, any punishment and reward from the emperor

75
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,670
should be accepted gratefully!

76
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,150
-They should be accepted gratefully.
-They should be accepted gratefully.

77
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,140
Gratefully?

78
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,640
How ridiculous!

79
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,310
Do you think I'm doing this

80
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,790
just to settle a personal feud?

81
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,580
You're wrong.

82
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,500
What's that?

83
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,970
What's that?

84
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,450
What's that?

85
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,670
Li Sun not only tampered with historical records

86
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,470
to hide the truth

87
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,150
that he killed his own wife

88
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,150
but also erased the records

89
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,860
of everything Scarlet Guards have done for this country

90
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,860
in the past years.

91
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,500
In the box are records

92
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,750
of the achievements Scarlet Guards have made

93
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,050
at the cost of numerous lives.

94
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,470
They've been kept from the public

95
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,460
and locked in Scarlet Guards' file room.

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,510
Deng Hui.

97
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,020
I've never colluded with Ren.

98
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,240
Your Majesty, you had the guts to hang Scarlet Guards

99
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,740
right outside the court for no reason.

100
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,340
Why do you not dare to tell the world about their achievements?

101
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,970
Because since the late emperor ascended the throne,

102
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,860
Scarlet Guards have been treated

103
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,409
like worthless slaves that don't need to be respected.

104
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,850
Despite the fact that Scarlet Guards were fearless,

105
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,790
cracked the treason case of Lord Xun,

106
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,659
defeated Jiannan Army at the cost of 160 lives,

107
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,190
killed the military governors

108
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,700
of Fengxiang, Dingnan, and Baosheng,

109
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,770
and got rid of Lord Xin of Nanping

110
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,980
and Empress Dowager Yuan of Chu,

111
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,220
they still don't deserve

112
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,240
to be mentioned in the histories.

113
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,570
It's true that Scarlet Guards did all the dirty work,

114
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,010
but does that mean

115
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,200
they haven't made any contributions to An?

116
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,720
Do you know

117
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:20,980
these things he did?

118
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,510
Don't you feel worried?

119
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,510
He's so cruel to Scarlet Guards.

120
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,770
Who knows

121
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,530
if he'll do the same to you one day?

122
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:44,770
Enough.

123
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:47,750
Ren Xin.

124
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,990
What on earth do you want?

125
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:54,850
If you want to kill me, just do it.

126
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,909
I'm the emperor of An.

127
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,750
I did what I did.

128
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,840
A great success

129
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,490
has to be achieved alone.

130
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,600
A man with great ambitions

131
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,550
shouldn't be concerned with trivial things.

132
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,970
But we're not trivial.

133
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,690
We're living people.

134

00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,970
That's Scarlet Guards' office.

188
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,740
All Scarlet Guards, listen carefully.

189
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,570
This is the formula

190
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,970
of the antidote to the poison the court uses to control White Sparrows.

191
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,620
Outside the east, south, west, and north city gates,

192
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,690
I've prepared herbs for you.

193
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,300
Scarlet Guards' file room has been burned down.

194
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,680
Nothing can restrict you now.

195
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,130
If you don't want to be Scarlet Guards anymore,

196
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:23,930
there's a big world outside

197
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,550
waiting for you to explore.

198
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,290
This should be true.

199
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,210
Great.

200
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,710
-We're free!
-We're free!

201
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,410
Don't move!

202
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,950
Behave yourselves!

203
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,240
Ren Xin.

204
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,370
What?

205
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,310
You despised Scarlet Guards when they were of use to you.

206
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,880
Now that I'm setting them free,

207
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,250
you want them to stay?

208
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:51,330
Everyone,

209
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,080
what I've done today

210
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,250
is all my doing,

211
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,040
not anyone else's.

212
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,450
Ren Xin, stop!

213
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,090
You must not harm His Majesty!

214
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,480
Don't worry.

215
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,120
I'm not a heartless beast like him.

216
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,430
I know if I kill him, An will be thrown into chaos.

217
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,500
If other countries take advantage of it,

218
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,090
the people will suffer again.

219
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,630
Then release His Majesty now!

220
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:17,570
Don't be afraid.

221
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,310
I'll in no way let you die.

222
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:31,430
Your Majesty.

223
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,520
Your Majesty!

224
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,290
Your Majesty.

225
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:50,960
Your Majesty.

226
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,480
Where were you just now?

227
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,210
I'm terribly sorry, Your Majesty.

228
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:00,970
Go.

229
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,410
Get Ren Xin back.

230
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,570
If you fail, I'll kill you

231
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:12,610
and dig up the graves of three generations of your family.

232
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,760
Go!

233
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,840
Yes, Your Majesty.

234
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,410
Wang Donglai.

235
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,970
Greetings, Your Majesty.

236
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:31,690
What happened today

237
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,370
was done by an outlaw.

238
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,100
Leave and…

239
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,450
You know

240
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,550
what you should say.

241
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,130
Yes, Your Majesty.

242
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,010
Here is His Majesty's oral order.

243
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,570
What happened tonight was done by an outlaw.

244
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,530
Historiographers shall not record it.

245
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,890
Anyone who disobeys will be executed.

246
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,360
But…

247
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,410
Your Majesty.

248
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,290
Yang Xingyuan ran away.

249
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,280
What?

250
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,530
You actually let him run away?

251
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,150
What were you court guards doing?

252
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,100
What were you doing?

253
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:39,930
Hurry.

254
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,170
Go get Shouji.

255
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,530
Ask him to get Yang Xingyuan back.

256
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:48,970
Where is my ox horn?

257
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,690
Where is my ox horn?

258
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,690
Where is my ox horn?

259
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,280
My ox horn!

260
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,530
Are you all deaf?

261
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:03,850
Are you deaf?

262
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,240
Sorry, Your Majesty.

263
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,890
But First Prince has already…

264
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,390
Shouji

265
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,530
has died.

266
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,210
Zhenye

267
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,520
has been banished by me.

268
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,650
Don't follow me.

269
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,810
Don't follow me.

270
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,650
We're not White Sparrows anymore.

271
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:28,810
We don't have to dress like this

272
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,010
to seduce men anymore.

273
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,250
Great.

274
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,660
Have you got the antidote?

275
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,160
Yes. We're free.

276
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,690
Where are you going to go next?

277
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,400
We're free.

278
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,580
My Lord.

279
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,330
Don't call me that again.

280
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,610
It's all in the past.

281
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,130
From now on,

282
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:07,570
I'm just Ruyi

283
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,920
and you're just Meiniang.

284
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,480
Don't mind me.

285
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:14,850
Leave An Capital now.

286
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,070
After the dust settles,

287
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,330
we'll meet again.

288
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,160
Are you going to meet Ning Yuanzhou now?

289
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,310
Yes.

290
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,450
I made such a scene

291
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,810
to cause a distraction for them.

292
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,440
Jiu will help them leave the city.

293
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,620
Take care.

294
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,010
Take care.

295
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:01,800
Stop.

296
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,819
I'm Li Tongguang, General of Yulin Guards.

297
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,349
Several spies have sneaked into the capital.

298
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,319
To prevent civil unrest,

299
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,470
Yulin Guards are to take over the defense of all the gates now.

300
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,240
No.

301
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,290
It's the duty of Imperial Guards to guard the city gates.

302
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,770
We can't just stand down.

303
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,740
That's the ox horn.

304
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:20,520
Something has gone wrong.

305
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:22,030
You stay here.

306
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,060
I have to find my master.

307
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,690
You… Come back!

308
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:41,380
Boss.

309
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,250
Ruyi has done her part.

310
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,170
Boss.

311
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:48,830
At the city gates,

312
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,200
Marquis Changqing's men are already in position.

313
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:56,930
Get up.

314
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,640
We'll stick to the plan.

315
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,770
After Imperial Guards and Yulin Army start fighting,

316
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,400
we'll escape in the chaos.

317
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,010
Yes.

318
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:05,610
Go.

319
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:11,690
You guys will escort His Majesty.

320
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,070
I'll go back to save Ying.

321
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:15,850
But…

322
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,860
My mind is set.

323
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,270
Do as I say.

324
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,130
Hurry. Hurry.

325
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,720
Master!

326
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,740
Master!

327
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,730
Master!

328
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,380
Master!

329
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:18,940
It's you.

330
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:20,740
Where is my master?

331
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,480
Prince Li is there.

332
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,600
They're Scarlet Guards.

333
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,420
Go, go.

334
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,260
I know you.

335
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,530
You're Marquis Changqing who is in charge of Yulin Guards.

336
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,260
Why did your people set the fire to kill me?

337
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,040
Why?

338
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,990
Marquis, don't listen to Prince Li.

339
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,370
Are you implying Prince Li set the fire to kill himself?

340
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:40,690
Go put out the fire!

341
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,610
Or I'll ask His Majesty

342
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,760
to punish you for attempting to kill the foreign envoy.

343
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,090
Get lost!

344
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,210
They all left.

345
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,410
I've stayed to cover for them.

346
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,380
I didn't ask you that.

347
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,840
I want to know where my master is.

348
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,930
She didn't tell me.

349
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,010
I just know she went to the court.

350
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,650
The court?

351
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,370
Shouldn't she be with the delegation?

352
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,180
Where are you taking me?

353
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,190
Shut up.

354
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,170
If I didn't know how sad Master would be

355
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:27,130
if you died,

356
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,820
I wouldn't even say a word to you.

357
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:54,930
Yuanzhou.

358
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,010
Ruyi.

359
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,310
Are you alright?

360
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,010
I'm fine.

361
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:20,960
Good.

362
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,970
Deng Hui is hard to deal with,

363
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,130
but you gave me your Hongchen.

364
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,000
Why are you here?

365
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,450
Didn't we agree to meet outside the city?

366
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,160
Have you failed to save the emperor of Wu?

367
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,170
We've saved him.

368
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,130
But something went wrong.

369
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,010
Ying stayed at Siyi Pavilion

370
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,050
to cover for us.

371
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,410
I was going to save her.

372
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,050
I'll go with you.

373
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:47,970
Let's go together.

374
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,210
Hurry.

375
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,330
All right.

376
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:10,530
Let's go.

377
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,160
You leave now. I'll save her.

378
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,050
Why?

379
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,740
The ox horn that keeps blaring

380
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,610
is the distress signal of Shazhong Tribe.

381
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:22,450
The emperor of An no longer trusts

382
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,650
Scarlet Guards and Yulin Guards.

383
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,970
So he's called in the best troops

384
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,080
of his own tribe.

385
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,680
I didn't expect them to arrive so soon.

386
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:32,410
But those soldiers just now were from Shazhong Tribe.

387
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,080
They're headed to the court

388
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,570
and must be guarding the city gates now.

389
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,880
With them there,

390
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,440
Jiu's Yulin Guards

391
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,000
may not be able to take over the defense

392
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,210
and let the delegation out

393
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,250
as we planned.

394
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,650
I can save Ying alone.

395
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,550
Getting your emperor out of An Capital safely

396
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,840
is what you should do.

397
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,090
If something goes wrong with that,

398
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:57,770
you won't be able to save anyone in the end.

399
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:00,890
No, Ruyi.

400
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,600
It's too dangerous for you to go alone.

401
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:03,470
I…

402
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:06,850
We both know

403
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:08,860
this is the best solution.

404
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,410
As long as Ying is still alive,

405
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,410
I'll keep her safe.

406
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,730
Chief Ning.

407
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,770
Please trust Left Emissary Ren for once.

408
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:33,700
Okay.

409
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:35,970
I trust you.

410
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:53,610
I'll wait for you.

411
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,680
I'll wait for you for two days at Liuli Fortress.

412
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,410
If you didn't come,

413
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,890
I'd find you even if I had to go to the underworld.

414
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:08,440
Do you hear me?

415
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,100
It's a deal.

416
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,320
Be careful.

417
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,280
Hand over Prince Li.

418
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,020
You want Prince Li?

419
00:24:58,770 --> 00:24:59,950
Over my dead body.

420
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,180
How dare you disobey His Majesty's oral order?

421
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,890
The capital is in complete chaos tonight.

422
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,320
I don't trust anyone.

423
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,630
I only trust the sword in my hand.

424
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,670
Since I'm the Commissioner for Presentations for Wu's delegation,

425
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,620
I can't let some random guy take away Prince Li.

426
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,380
If His Majesty holds me accountable,

427
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,780
General Li,

428
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,700
will you take the blame for me?

429
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,350
You…

430
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,050
Your Highness.

431
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:48,610
I suddenly find it hard to breathe.

432
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:56,750
Oh no.

433
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,570
He's inhaled too much smoke and his pulse is getting weaker.

434
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:00,530
Send for a physician.

435
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,090
You want to take Prince Li away, don't you?

436
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:06,790
Okay.

437
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:08,730
If he dies,

438
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,140
you'll explain it to His Majesty.

439
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,980
Fine. You win.

440
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,650
There are so many people here.

441
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,050
I dare you to release Prince Li.

442
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,600
Strengthen the defense of the city gates.

443
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,700
Don't let any Wu people leave.

444
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:32,770
Yes.

445
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:38,730
Are you freaking out?

446
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,170
After I figure out

447
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,250
why you insisted

448
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,930
on taking over the four city gates,

449
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,690
we'll explain it to His Majesty together.

450
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:47,900
Let's go.

451
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,750
So many more soldiers have arrived.

452
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,030
Yuanzhou and the others…

453
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,040
Ying, Jiu.

454
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:11,940
Ruyi.

455
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:12,760
Master.

456
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,410
Given the current situation, it's hard for them to leave the city.

457
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,620
I must distract Shazhong Tribe's troops.

458
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:19,510
Stay with Jiu.

459
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,620
He'll protect you.

460
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,240
Come to me after sending Ying somewhere safe.

461
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,310
I'll get you off the hook and help you have a meteoric rise.

462
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,480
Who are you?

463
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:41,650
Ren Xin.

464
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,330
After her! Go after her!

465
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,270
Go! Go!

466
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:02,680
What are you doing?

467
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,050
Let us out! Let us out!

468
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,180
Back off! Back off!

469
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,570
Let us out!

470
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:09,130
Go back! How dare you!

471
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,890
Fire! Fire!

472
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,130
Get out of the city! Get out of the city!

473
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,220
Back off!

474
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,850
Let us out! Let us out!

475
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:18,970
Excuse me. Excuse me.

476
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,080
Sir. Sir.

477
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,060
Sir. Sir. Sir.

478
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,480
We're herbalists from another city.

479
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,640
We're here to deliver herbs.

480
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,570
Those herbs must be delivered today.

481
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:26,940
Otherwise, we'll have to pay for the delay.

482
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,370
No. We've been ordered not to let anyone leave.

483
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,210
Back off!

484
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:29,810
Sir.

485
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:31,770
Fire!

486
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,330
Fire!

487
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:34,570
Back off!

488
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:37,050
Fire! Fire!

489
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,470
Boss? Why are you back?

490
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:41,650
Do you hear me? Back off!

491
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:42,770
Let us out!

492
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:43,860
Back off!

493
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:49,600
Let me out!

494
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,270
Back off!

495
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,140
Let us out!

496
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:54,670
What's that sound?

497
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:56,050
You two, go check it out.

498
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,090
Let us out!

499
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,360
Go.

500
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:00,250
Don't move.

501
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,270
Stop. Go back.

502
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,350
Come back. Come back.

503
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:03,980
Let's go.

504
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:05,810
Come back!

505
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:07,860
Keep order. Close the gate.

506
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:08,970
Hurry!

507
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:43,850
Great.

508
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,090
Kill!

509
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:28,010
Kill me.

510
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:34,000
You're my opponent,

511
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,600
not my enemy.

512
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,150
You're doing your job and I'm doing mine.

513
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:38,610
Why should I kill you?

514
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,130
Kill!

515
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:15,650
Kill!

516
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,730
Left Emissary Ren, stop fighting.

517
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,650
Stop it, Left Emissary Ren.

518
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,170
Stop fighting!

519
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:40,770
Ren Xin.

520
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:42,770
Drop your sword now

521
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,450
and I'll give you a quick death.

522
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:54,830
This time,

523
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,740
do you think I'll still believe you?

524
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:01,490
Kill her!

525
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,940
Ren Xin, you traitor!

526
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,400
I'll take your life!

527
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,620
Li Tongguang.

528
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,190
You've actually turned against me too.

529
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:38,200
What? Do you want to kill your own master?

530
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,080
I came here to save you, Master.

531
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,420
I told you

532
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,180
I'll get you off the hook and help you have a meteoric rise.

533
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,570
Do it now. I can't escape.

534
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:11,090
No, Master. Don't make me do it.

535
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:12,530
Master, don't make me do it.

536
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,390
Master, don't make me…

537
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:15,730
Worship of the Phoenix.

538
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,110
Only when I'm gone

539
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,560
can you stop being Jiu and become Li Tongguang.

00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:18,110
♫The east wind is the cruelest♫

541
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:22,250

We can't stop.

553
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,770
We have to get to Liuli Fortress as soon as possible.

554

563
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,390
His Majesty has ordered me

564
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,070
to bring Ren Xin, the traitor, back to the court.

565
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:28,110
♫You're the one person I can never get over♫

566
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:22,670
Marquis Changqing.

567
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,090
You're brave and decisive.

568
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:27,750
You risked your life to take down the criminal.

569
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,550
It was a heroic deed.

570
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:32,530
I'll personally report every detail to His Majesty.

571
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:37,630
♫You're the wrong person but this love feels so right♫

572
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:38,540
Let's go.

573
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:45,540
♫I'll spend the rest of my life♫

574
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:54,640
♫On the fool's errand of forgetting you♫

575
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:00,700
♫Because of you, my years became important and then not♫

576
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:04,960
♫My world begins and ends with you♫

577
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:08,950
♫There's love in all weathers♫

578
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:12,540
♫The vast expanse of the world is in your palms♫

579
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:20,410
♫If you're the treasure of my dreams♫

580
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:28,710
♫I want to hold on to you but it's too late♫

581
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:37,370
♫It's too late, so I have to cling to these memories♫

582
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:45,440
♫Forgetting you is a fool's errand♫

583
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,000
Go get a carriage.

584
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,140
Yes.

585
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:54,040
♫Forgetting you is a fool's errand♫

586
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:57,930
Commander Deng.

587
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:01,010
Are you feeling sorry for me

588
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:04,270
or has what I said on the court wall

589
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,330
struck a chord in you?

590
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:10,070
Talk less. Save your strength.

591
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,570
Let me talk.

592
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:17,890
I'm dying.

593
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,850
I was sold to Scarlet Guards before I turned ten.

594
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,530
Now I'm going to die for Scarlet Guards.

595
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:29,580
This is my fate.

596
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,210
He knows

597
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,910
your father was killed by Scarlet Guards

598
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,980
but still made you the commander.

599
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,210
Has he ever thought that

600
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,650
you'd be heartbroken

601
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,900
and sad too?

602
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,750
He's ordered you

603
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,980
to reform Scarlet Guards

604
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,040
yet wants you

605
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,470
to stay by his side like a dog

606
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:03,040
as the old Scarlet Guards did.

607
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,060
It's my fault. It's my fault.

608
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,700
You were a dog in the mud.

609
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:10,770
I gave you everything you have.

610
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,470
I'll kill you

611
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:17,130
and dig up the graves of three generations of your family.

612
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,150
I've looked into you.

613
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,430
You once asked to leave the cavalry camp

614
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,450
to defend Mount Guan.

615
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,300
Actually, you had the dream

616
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,410
of firing arrows

617
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,320
and fighting on horseback on the frontline, didn't you?

618
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,390
But he refused to let you go.

619
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:39,930
He wants you to be his dog on a leash

620
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,050
and to bind you to him

621
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,380
for your whole life.

622
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,720
Don't try to turn me against His Majesty.

623
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,110
Stay quiet. Don't cough yourself to death.

624
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:57,790
You'll suffer more after you meet His Majesty later.

625
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,970
Because of the scene I made,

626
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,530
most of your White Sparrows

627
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,020
have run away, right?

628
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,980
No wonder you won't let me die

629
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,350
and want me to stay alive to suffer.

630
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,070
Don't think I can't tell

631
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,090
why you made a scene on the court wall.

632
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:24,370
I bet you were causing a distraction

633
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:26,750
to buy time for someone.

634
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,300
You deliberately let Marquis Changqing hurt you

635
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,350
because you wanted to make him a hero

636
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:35,730
to clear him of all suspicion.

637
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:39,210
I didn't expose you

638
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,370
and gave him all the credit in front of everyone.

639
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:42,740
I did you a favor.

640
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,490
I once did you a favor as well.

641
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,050
I know.

642
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,530
That day outside the court,

643
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,470
the kind person Ning Yuanzhou mentioned

644
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,970
who wouldn't let the guards die for nothing

645
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,930
was you.

646
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:59,040
Why did you help me?

647
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:02,840
Because I'm just like you.

648
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,460
I hate Scarlet Guards,

649
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,540
but I don't kill the innocent.

650
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:25,490
Take this medicine.

651
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:41,210
I don't want to die

652
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:45,130
in front of that despicable man who told lies and killed his wife.

653
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,990
You promised to give me a quick death.

654
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:52,360
You lied to me at Wannian Temple.

655
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,380
You owe me one.

656
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:10,850
Here.

657
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,860
My heart is here.

658
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,410
You're still afraid of him.

659
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:32,170
You don't dare to disobey him.

660
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,310
How many people have left?

661
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,400
As of an hour ago,

662
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,220
90% of White Sparrows,

663
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:23,410
60% of the other guards,

664
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,870
35% of Purple Emissaries, and their superiors hadn't returned.

665
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:52,310
You must be here to see her off.

666
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,060
You should be.

667
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:58,370
She was really nice to you.

668
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:00,660
She actually gave up her life

669
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,280
to get you a prominent position.

670
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:21,160
Yang Xingyuan escaped from Donghu Cottage.

671
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,720
After His Majesty calms down,

672
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:24,540
he'll surely ask about that.

673
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,700
What are you going to say?

674
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:30,770
It was court guards who guarded Donghu Cottage.

675
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:32,930
What did it have to do with Scarlet Guards?

676
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:35,490
More than half of Scarlet Guards have left.

677
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,630
If I die too,

678
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:40,770
His Majesty

679
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:43,090
won't have anyone he can trust around him.

680
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:47,170
I'm surprised.

681
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:51,140
We're not friends.

682
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:54,370
Why have you come here to warn me?

683
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,740
I want to help you.

684
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,560
He's old.

685
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,680
Planning ahead is good for both of us.

686
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:07,210
Tell me about your plan.

687
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,000
His Majesty wants to make Li Zhenye the crown prince.

688
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,230
But I won't let it happen.

689
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,540
You should support Third Prince with me.

690
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,180
After all, he's just a kid

691
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:21,620
and won't turn his back on us

692
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,680
for at least a decade.

693
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:29,140
What do you want me to do?

694
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:31,330
Tell His Majesty

695
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:32,810
you found out

696
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,110
that Wu's delegation bribed Chu people

697
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:37,900
to set a trap to kill me halfway.

698
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:45,420
Got it.

699
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:50,030
Commander Deng, so much for your loyalty

700
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:54,160
to His Majesty.

701
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:02,930
Did it feel wonderful

702
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,120
to kill the woman you love?

703
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,650
Here's to you.

704
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,180
I wish you a bright future

705
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,010
and a successful life.
