[A Journey To Love]

3
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,900
[Episode 21]

4
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,990
The medicine of the State of An.

5
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,910
Whether it's All-Purpose Antidote

6
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,980
or the pill I can't remember the name,

7
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,620
it's really useful.

8
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,190
It's Gengshi Pill.

9
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,790
It's the tribute from the Shaxi Tribe.

10
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,020
Since Li Tongguang is engaged to Duke Chu's daughter,

11
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,670
Duke Chu is certainly willing to give him the best.

12
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,270
In that case,

13
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,630
your disciple is not that bad.

14
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,390
Cry if you want to.

15
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,430
I'll watch for you. No one will notice.

16
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,580
No need.

17
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,030
Then drink this.

18
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,020
I don't want to drink alcohol.

19
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,120
I know.

20
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,630
It's Longan and Red Date Soup which Sun Lang just made.

21
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,740
It helps to enrich blood.

22
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,990
It's beneficial to your appearance.

23
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,750
It's also good for your skin if you drink it.

24
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,030
I don't want to cry in front of him.

25
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,350
I'm afraid he'll be worried.

26
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:38,870
I know.

27
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,650
Me too.

28
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,630
But last night,

29
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,780
only your eyes weren't red.

30
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,070
That's who I am.

31
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,390
In my life,

32
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,550
if I can drink the best alcohol,

33
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,990
see the prettiest women,

34
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,830
win the biggest battles,

35
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,740
and have the loyalest friends,

36
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,270
my life will be worth living.

37
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,230
If Ning hadn't survived this time,

38
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,400
I would also give him a gourd of alcohol.

39
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,610
Anyway, in a few years,

40
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,420
we'll meet again in the Palace of Hell.

41
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,070
You're so optimistic.

42
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,310
I hope you and Ning can also be optimistic.

43
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,030
Relations between you have been strained for so long.

44
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,260
I can't persuade you.

45
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,150
Because I know

46
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,610
everyone has their own persistence and feelings.

47
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,950
It's just like you persuade me.

48
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,230
If you force me to get married,

49
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,570
I'd rather die.

50
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,480
But...

51
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,470
You don't have to persuade me.

52
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,870
What do you think I will say?

53
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,620
For the sake of pitiful Boss Ning,

54
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,190
don't leave him?

55
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,260
What are you thinking?

56
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:56,750
I'm worried about you.

57
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,060
I saw what you looked like last night.

58
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,110
You sacrificed half of your blood to save him.

59
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,660
Without him,

60
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,470
you're the one who can't stand it.

61
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,830
Hear me out.

62
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,270
I know both of you are strong,

63
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,160
but it doesn't mean the strong don't deserve to be afraid

64
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,240
and be taken care of.

65
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,060
Every woman is a flower.

66
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,750
Every man is a tree.

67
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,510
In the crowd,

68
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,430
it's not easy

69
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,890
to find someone who supports you.

70
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,580
You have someone worth risking your life to protect.

71
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,990
Then what problems

72
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,630
cannot be solved?

73
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,100
I said you don't have to persuade me.

74
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,490
Because I've made up my mind.

75
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,220
Thank you.

76
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,360
Where are you going?

77
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,590
Send some people to keep an eye on An people.

78
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,390
The moves of those men in black are too weird.

79
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,230
Li Tongguang is investigating.

80
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,510
You have to investigate it too.

81
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,710
Don't worry.

82
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,460
Sun Lang has already taken some people there.

83
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,310
That's good.

84
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,300
Send some people

85
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,430
to keep an eye on the posthouse too,

86
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,740
in case the men in black come again at night.

87
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,909
He County also needs to be investigated.

88
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,550
I don't believe those men in black

89
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,430
come from nowhere.

90
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:42,950
Also,

91
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,880
go to Jinsha Pavilion

92
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,710
and ask Jin Meiniang.

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,320
Shisan has already sent a letter to Jinsha Pavilion.

94
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,430
Don't worry.

95
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,630
That's good.

96
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,750
If it's business,

97
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,780
I believe Jin Meiniang won't give him a hard time.

98
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,220
I'm a little tired.

99
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,470
Help me lie down.

100
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,180
Okay.

101
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,820
Have a good rest.

102
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:25,910
Let's go.

103
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,430
Come in.

104
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:55,909
You've been standing for a long time, right?

105
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,470
You...

106
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:06,920
Lie down with me for a while.

107
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,830
-I have something to...
-Actually, I…

108
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,510
Let me go first this time.

109
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,309
Okay?

110
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:42,990
Okay.

111
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,470
I wanted to say this long ago.

112
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,970
But I didn't have much strength yesterday.

113
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,000
I was at death's door this time.

114
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,430
I realized

115
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,910
that I'm a complete fool.

116
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,110
I have such a good person by my side,

117
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,140
but I didn't cherish you.

118
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,820
We've already been through life and death,

119
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,950
but because of Li Tongguang

120
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,080
and some trivial matters,

121
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,290
I fell out with you for a long time.

122
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:24,910
Yes.

123
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,310
I only noticed that your eyes are small.

124
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,190
I didn't expect that when you get jealous,

125
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,990
your heart is also small.

126
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,590
I won't do it again.

127
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,390
This time,

128
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,710
I saw how desperate you were

129
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,590
to save me.

130
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,110
I swore in my heart

131
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,950
that as long as I could wake up,

132
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,130
I would never let go of your hands again.

133
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,360
It's not entirely your fault.

134
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,790
It's also my fault for not telling you in advance.

135
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,470
No. It's all my fault.

136
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,550
It's all my fault.

137
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,430
Ruyi.

138
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:35,590
From now on,

139
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,470
no matter what you do,

140
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,990
I'll be with you.

141
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,590
Whether you want to travel the world with swords

142
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,070
or find a lively place to live,

143
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,190
anyway,

144
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,750
I won't impose my will on you.

145
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,350
I'll also hear your thoughts,

146
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,870
respect your choices,

147
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,310
and respect every decision you make.

148
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,770
But haven't you been tired of the world for a long time?

149
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,790
You want to live a secluded life, don't you?

150
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,030
I'm tired of so many things.

151
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:18,870
I'm also tired of

152
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,610
Qian's poker face.

153
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,110
I'm tired of

154
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,670
Shisan being mouthy.

155
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,590
I'm also tired of Yuan Lu being so naughty.

156
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,230
But they're still my friends.

157
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:46,010
♫My palm line branched because of you♫

158
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:44,690
When this thing is over,

159
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,100
we'll stay in Central Plain for a while

160

♫My hands hurt when spring comes♫

161

162
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,070
Then we'll visit your empress's grave.

♫I don't know how to put it♫

164

♫Every time I turn around♫

167
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,990
and drink alcohol with Jin Meiniang.

168
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,270
If you miss these friends,

169
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:07,960
♫I expect to see you there♫

170
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,880
I'll take you to the palace

♫Drunk, I saw your eyes; dreaming, I had you in my arms♫

181

♫Waking up sober, I only miss you more♫

183
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,710

How's the investigation going?

222
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,360
We only checked a few bodies.

223
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,590
There's no mark on their weapons and clothes.

224
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,420
They came prepared.

225
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,730
But judging by the formation, they were indeed from the Scarlet Guards.

226
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,030
Where are the bodies?

227
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,800
Over there.

who attacked us first?

232
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,670
All the women's bodies are here.

233
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,490
They were indeed from the Scarlet Guards.

234
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,260
Master once told me

235
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,630
if women of the Scarlet Guards fail to complete missions,

236
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,610
they will be punished severely.

237
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,230
They often do it here.

238
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,740
So their bones here

239
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,270
are more crooked than those of normal people.

240
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:28,670
Is it because

241
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,550
you kicked them out of He County last time,

242
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,030
they came to take revenge?

243
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,470
I don't care why they did it.

246
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,400
Then tell Deng Hui

247
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,920
if he offers no explanation in three days,

248
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,310
I'll report it to His Majesty directly.

249
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,620
Are you suspecting Commander Deng?

250
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,750
But he only respects His Majesty.

251
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,190

00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,430
He doesn't have personal grudges against me.

253
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,020
But his Left Emissary Chen Gui may not be so.

254
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,670

00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,430

256
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,950
only my master is the Left Emissary of the Scarlet Guards.

I didn't get a chance to report it to you.

263
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,710
It's Beipan?

264
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,350
That's impossible.

265
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,930
The secret tunnel was dug by Beipan people?

266
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,760
When I was little, I heard from adults

267
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,790
that Beipan had many conflicts with Central Plain.

[He County, Zuojia Ridge Cave]

269
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,270
But aren't they in the cold north?

270
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,120
That's right.

271
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,960
Although Beipan people have been living in the north for generations,

272
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,570
they've been plotting something.

273
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,010
About 60 years ago,

274
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,070
the emperor of the former dynasty sacrificed his life

275
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,190
to defeat the Beipan Tribe.

276
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,680
But the state of the former dynasty also lost a lot of troops

277
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:45,980
and disintegrated.

278
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,410
Since then, there has been nine states in the world.

279
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,730
Fifty years ago,

280
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:54,970
the emperors of An, Wu, and Chu formed an alliance

281
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,280
to build protective Tianmenguan, which is hundreds of miles long.

282
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,750
Each of them sent 3,000 soldiers to guard Tianmenguan

283
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,440
to protect Central Plain.

284
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,950
Later, the State of Chu was defeated.

285
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,589
His Majesty was then defeated by the emperor of An.

286
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:08,390
That's why Tianmenguan belongs to the State of An now.

287
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,329
Maybe the battle which happened two months ago

288
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:13,480
gave the Beipan Tribe another chance.

289
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,190
Look.

290

Their fifth teeth on both sides

291
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,630
were all sharpened.

292
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:26,950
And

293
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,130
look at this.

294
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,430
I'm most familiar with the hair

295

296

This kind of hair

297
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,890
is typical of black beasts of Beipan.

298
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,430

Why are there Beipan people in the Scarlet Guards?

301
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,070
Right.

302
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,030
How could there be Beipan people?

303
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:50,910
The sharp teeth

304
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,760
and the soft scale armor no blade could pierce yesterday.

00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,400

306
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,250
I'm here.

00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,300
Assemble the troops.

Follow me and investigate Tianmenguan immediately.

309
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,750
Yes.

310
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:00,760
No need.

311
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,750
Our Mr. Ning has already found out the truth.

312
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,390
He asked me to deliver a message to you.

313
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,420
If you want to know what's going on,

314
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,710
go and meet him at the entrance of the cave next to the Earth God Temple of Zuojia Ridge.

315
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,390
What are you doing?

316
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,390
Beipan people came.

317
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,700
I don't have time to waste with you.

318
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,590
In the past two months,

319
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,750
a total of six robberies have occurred in He County.

320
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,960
More than 30 families in the two villages suffered.

321
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,450
But the officials of the State of An

322
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,910
blamed them on bandits and ended the cases hastily.

323
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,550
Marquis Changqing, do you know these things?

324
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,750
You mean these things are related to Beipan people?

325
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,570
But Wu Qian, the general of He County, said

326
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,870
that there was no trace of Beipan people before.

327
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:01,370
That

328
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,180
is the secret tunnel we found

329
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,750
after following the men in black back to the woods.

330
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,830
Although the entrance is narrow,

331
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,710
it's about dozens of miles long inside,

332
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,110
leading directly to the outside of Tianmenguan.

333
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,030
It's about dozens of miles long?

334
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,750
Have Beipan people been planning it for a long time?

335
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:19,950
That's right.

336
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,900
A secret tunnel like this

337
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,830
cannot be built within a few years.

338
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,640
In recent years, wars between the State of An and the State of Wu have been endless.

339
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,030
The emperor of the State of An

340
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,750
also transferred a lot of soldiers from Tianmenguan.

341
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,870
That’s why Beipan people had a chance

342
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,190
to build this secret tunnel.

343
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,810
The first time villagers in He County suffered

344
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,870
was two months ago.

345
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,150
In other words,

346
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,030
Beipan people must have finished building the secret tunnel at that time.

347
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,510
When the two states were at war,

348
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,270
Beipan people only dared to nose around

349
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,150
and then robbed villagers.

350
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,830
They killed all the villagers and returned in a hurry.

351
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,470
Exactly.

352
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,430
They rarely dispatched nearly 100 people.

353
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,150
But the village they went

354
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,390
didn't have much money and food left.

355
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,860
So they were upset when they left.

356
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:18,870
But coincidentally,

357
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,750
when they were going back to the cave through the woods,

358
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,270
they found you, who lost a fight

359
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,470
with the Scarlet Guards.

360
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,850
You had fine carriages and horses. Your clothing and food were expensive.

361
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,560
Even your maid was wearing jewels.

362
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,270
How could they

363
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,260
let you go easily?

364
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:34,890
At this time,

365
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,820
people from the Liudao Hall arrived as reinforcements.

366
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,230
Beipan people wanted to retreat,

367
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,860
but they couldn't expose the secret tunnel.

368
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,960
So they could only fight against us.

369
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:43,570
That's right.

370
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,230
Marquis Changqing.

371
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,350
This matter concerns the safety of both An people and Wu people.

372
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,030
I've already sent a letter by a pigeon to Wu Capital

373
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,030
and reported it.

374
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,670
Please tell your emperor

375
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,780
to strengthen the defense

376
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,100
of Tianmenguan and the secret tunnel.

377
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,030
OK.

378
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,590
I'll do my best to deal with things related to Beipan.

379
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,630
But I'm worried

380
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,030
that the memorial will be intercepted by the Scarlet Guards

381
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,350
before His Majesty gets it.

382
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,000
What worries me more is

383
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,370
that His Majesty only wants to invade other states.

384
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:15,590
He won't defend here.

385
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,510
He's been saying that Beipan people won't come these years.

386
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,470
So

387
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,180
I want your delegation to go with me as soon as possible

388
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,600
and travel day and night to return to An Capital.

389
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:26,990
Although the sneak attack from Beipan and the Scarlet Guards

390
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,910
might be a coincidence this time,

391
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,710
the Scarlet Guards is up to no good.

392
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,150
We must hurry back to An Capital just in case.

393
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,150
Besides,

394
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,470
I request that when you meet His Majesty,

395
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,310
you must emphasize again and again

396
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,510
that you've found out

397
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,950
that Beipan intends to send its troops south again

398
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:43,990
to breach Tianmenguan.

399
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:45,570
Well.

400
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,140
We helped him so much.

401
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,830
But he wants us to be bad guys.

402
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,550
OK.

403
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,110
I promise on behalf of His Highness.

404
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,550
We can leave in four hours.

405
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,070
Boss, you just recovered.

406
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,970
We have to travel day and night. Can you bear it?

407
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,510
I'm also injured.

408
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,110
This matter concerns Beipan. You're still delicate.

409
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,510
Enough chit-chat.

410
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,790
I'm afraid that Beipan people are up to something big.

411
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,390
Otherwise, they wouldn't have dug the secret tunnel.

412
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,120
Besides, I have Princess to take care of me.

413
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:33,750
Of course,

414
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,450
my minor injuries are nothing.

415
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,820
He's angry.

416
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,290
This boy

417
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,950
is not useless.

418
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,780
When we talked about business, he stopped being crazy.

419
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,990
Besides, Qian Zhao said

420
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,900
that among all the officials in the State of An,

421
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:05,000
he's the most concerned about matters of Beipan.

422
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:05,990
Of course.

423
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,630
If he dares to make mistakes in such important matters,

424
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,990
I'll definitely kill him.

425
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,580
But as long as he sees us being close,

426
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,350
he acts weird again.

427
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,170
This is a disease. It has to be cured.

428
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,310
You're talking like an elder.

429
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,240
You're his master, so I'm the spouse of his master.

430
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,110
Of course I'm his elder.

431
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,150
Your weird tone

432
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,750
is just like his.

433
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,230
I said I'm the spouse of his master.

434
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,630
You admitted it?

435
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,310
Of course you can be his elder.

436
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,380
After all,

437
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:44,950
he saved your life with Gengshi Pill.

438
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,030
What pill?

439
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:51,990
He saved my life?

440
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,210
What? No.

441
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:58,190
I... How did he save me?

442
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,960
I haven't recovered yet.

443
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,820
Come back and help me.

444
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,830
I heard

445
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:33,690
that Ning Yuanzhou, who's from the Liudao Hall, is really amazing.

446
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,890
He cut Beipan people off in a short time

447
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,460
and spread the news about blowing up the secret tunnel

448
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,660
among the officials in He County.

449
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,860
He told them that it was you who did it.

450
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,810
Helping me is just his strategy.

451
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,760
He thinks that it can make a marquis

452
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,030
be at his proposal?

453
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,660
What a joke!

454
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,500
There's a person

455
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,270
who addressed himself as "I" when asking for help.

456
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:00,330
It's only been a while. He addressed himself as "Marquis" again.

457
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:01,350
Who am I talking about?

458
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,550
Who? Who?

459
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,590
Who am I talking about?

460
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,390
I don't know.

461
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,310
I don't know either.

462
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,640
Marquis.

463
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,310
What's the rush?

464
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,190
When we get to An Capital,

465
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,180
they'll beg me then.

466
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,470
Bullshit.

467
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,780
Mr. Ning.

468
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,070
Thank you.

469
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,870
I have something to report.

470
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:36,590
What's wrong?

471
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,180
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

472
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,860
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

473
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,100
Let's go.

474
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,690
That was a fatal blow.

475
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,360
Let's go.

476
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,470
I'm inferior to you.

477
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,390
Don't go too far.

478
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,110
This young man is sensitive.

479
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:16,990
His tantrums

480
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,150
will affect our mission.

481
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,030
Whatever.

482
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,550
If he wanted to hate us, he would have hated us long ago.

483
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,230
-It doesn’t matter.
-Whatever.

484
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,470
Marquis, Liu Li is badly injured.

485
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,230
The doctor said it's not appropriate for her to move.

486
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,590
So I took the liberty of letting her stay in He County.

487
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,700
I knew.

488
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,880
Ask our people to speed up.

489
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,750
Don't give the Wu people a chance to laugh.

490
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:42,710
Yes.

491
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:43,240
Let's go.

492
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,030
Let's go.

493
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,670
Let's go.

494
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,110
[The State of An, Houzhou]

495
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,090
[Houzhou Posthouse]

496
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,950
Dinner is ready.

497
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:00,990
Boss.

498
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,240
There's freshly made chicken soup in this posthouse.

499
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,230
You just took the antidote to Ten-Day Qianji.

500
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,590
Here you go. It's good for your health.

501
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,390
Okay.

502
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,670
You got the antidote from Zhang Song's people?

503
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,300
Shisan and I went to get it in person.

504
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:14,950
They heard

505
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,590
about Boss Ning's exploits

506
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,470
and gave it to us without saying anything.

507
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:21,910
They just complained

508
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,140
that they had no choice but to obey Zhang Song and Zhao Ji before.

509
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,990
They'll obey your orders from now on.

510
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,740
Here you go. Beauty, have some chicken drumsticks.

511
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,350
Thank you.

512
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,030
Here you go.

513
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,230
Shisan, this is for you.

514
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,630
Why didn't you add a chicken wing?

515
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,120
Wait.

516
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,910
You can't drink this soup.

517
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,590
I've tried it. It's not poisonous.

518
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,470
Even though it's not poisonous, it can still harm people.

519
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,150
There's shrimp juice in the soup.

520
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,350
Shrimps are stimulating foods,

521
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,920
which make wounds slow to heal.

522
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,030
These meatballs were made of rabbit.

523
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,310
Eating them together can easily cause diarrhoea.

524
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:02,440
Li Tongguang. It must be him.

525
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:03,930
Is he crazy?

526
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,480
Why did he do it?

527
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,960
I guess it's because

528
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,230
Ning and Beauty

529
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,550
messed him up today.

530
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,400
We went too far.

531
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,210
That bastard.

532
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,560
I'll get even with him.

533
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,110
Don't go. Let me go.

534
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,870
This is a matter between me and him.

535
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,000
You can have the soup.

536
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:41,330
Drink it.

537
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:50,870
Who is it?

538
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,180
Did I scare you?

539
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,080
I haven't practiced for days.

540
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,160
I'm rusty.

541
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,380
What do you want?

542
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:21,080
The chicken soup and the meatballs you gave us

543
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,930
really taste good.

544
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,070
Is this how you thank

545
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,520
your savior?

546
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,920
I believe you know

547
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:41,010
that my martial art skills are far superior to yours.

548
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,710
It's quite easy for me to kill you.

549
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:49,300
Using incompatible food

550
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,590
is children's trick.

551
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,220
Why don't you just kill me?

552
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,750
Stop talking nonsense.

553
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,790
I came here today

554
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,070
to make a deal with you.

555
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,510
Li Tongguang.

556
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,310
You've been working hard and being cautious

557
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,810
for so many years,

558
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,860
because you want to end the tyranny of the emperor of An.

559
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,270
Unfortunately, although you have great ambition,

560
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,310
your ability is mediocre.

561
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,750
As long as you work with my Liudao Hall,

562
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,280
you don't have to flatter Noble Consort Chu

563
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,230
and prostitute yourself.

564
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,310
How do you know

565
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,010
about Noble Consort Chu?

566
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,450
I'm the chief of the Liudao Hall.

567
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,550
Of course I know things in the six paths.

568
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,440
Although the State of Wu lost the battle at Tianmenguan,

569
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:53,750
my divisions in the State of An are still capable.

570
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,110
Are you threatening me?

571
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,030
I just said it.

572
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:10,210
I'm here to make a deal with you.

573
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:30,900
Do you think

574
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,510
that if you can return to An Capital to see His Majesty in time

575
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,710
and have us as witnesses,

576
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,350
the emperor of An will be alert

577
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:39,110
and reward you after strengthening the defense against Beipan?

578
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,590
Stop dreaming.

579
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:44,170
You're exaggerating.

580
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,910
Of course not.

581
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:50,340
I'm afraid that you still don't know

582
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:52,500
that you're going to be in trouble.

583
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,230
I won't believe you.

584
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,640
Believe it or not.

585
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,760
You're too young and too aloof.

586
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:10,140
But you're not quite sophisticated.

587
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,230
Do you think

588
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,670
that no official in the court knows

589
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,750
that you're

590
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,810
dissatisfied with the emperor of An?

591
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,870
It's just because the emperor of An kept keeping you down.

592
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,520
They didn't think that you can stir up trouble.

593
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,200
But the situation has changed.

594
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,550
You're already a marquis.

595
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,470
And you've done a great job in the matter of Beipan.

596
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,060
Think about it.

597
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:36,660
What will the two princes

598
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,670
and people who hate you do?

599
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,550
They'll deny the military intelligence

600
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,230
and say that I colluded with the State of Wu

601
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,000
to take the credit.

602
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,190
They won't be that stupid.

603
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,070
After all, the officials in He County

604
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,400
can testify to the matter of Beipan.

605
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,800
I think

606
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,360
that they'll give you a bright future.

607
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,670
My Liudao Hall got the news

608
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,190
that the emperor of An

609
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,030
wants to attack the State of Chu

610
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,820
after receiveing our 100,000 taels of gold, right?

611
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,560
You just made a great contribution

612
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,190
and became a marquis.

613
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,980
So they'll elect you

614
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,750
as the spearhead in the war against the State of Chu.

615
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,890
Not to mention you don't want to start another war,

616
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,230
when you find that your soldiers

617
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:30,830
are old, weak, sick, and disabled

618
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,910
and that the provisions are bad,

619
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:36,300
do you think what the odds you can win against the State of Chu are?

620
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,270
If you lose the first battle

621
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,150
and they accuse you of being disloyal to the emperor,

622
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,480
will the emperor of An spare you?

623
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,860
Don't scare me.

624
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:55,240
I'll ask my subordinates to investigate these things in detail in advance.

625
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:56,930
They won't happen.

626
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,200
You've been an official for so many years.

627
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,430
Do you have any friends?

628
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,630
Except the person named Zhu Yin,

629
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:04,030
are you sure your subordinates dare to offend princes

630
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:05,470
and do whatever you say?

631
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,699
I'm engaged to Duke Chu's daughter.

632
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:15,889
Duke Chu won't leave me alone.

633
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:20,389
But I heard that Princess Jin Ming

634
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,420
doesn't seem to like you.

635
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,710
And it's common for noble ladies in the State of An

636
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,110
to remarry.

637
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,230
The emperor of An is warlike by nature.

638
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:41,750
The two princes are not kind either.

639
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,469
Every success in a battle

640
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,710
causes many corpses of common people.

641
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:52,100
Li Tongguang.

642
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,030
I knew that you've been being against the emperor of An starting another war.

643
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,590
That's why

644
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:01,430
I decided to lend you a hand.

645
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,210
Your Highness, please calm down.

646
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,190
Boss Ning

647
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,870
asked us to bring you here to hear the conversation,

648
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,470
because he wants you to know more

649
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:19,990
about the situation in the State of An's court.

650
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,830
It's okay if you don't know how to scheme,

651
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,460
but you must know it.

652
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,070
If you don't make a plan beforehand,

653
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,710
I won't consider working with you.

654
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,590
There's a plan.

655
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,590
First, pretend to be ill.

656
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,520
Tell them that after the assassination,

657
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,400
you traveled day and night to return to An Capital.

658
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,590
In this way, the officials

659
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:49,110
won't let you fight a war in a short time.

660
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,070
Besides, the emperor of An will also ask the Scarlet Guards

661
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,070
to give you an explanation.

662
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:53,790
Second,

663
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,710
you offended the two princes before at the same time.

664
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,110
But from now on,

665
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,690
you have to side with Second Prince.

666
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,390
As long as the two princes start to fight with each other,

667
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,420
you'll have a chance to take a break.

668
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,060
Third,

669
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,410
you're engaged to Duke Chu's daughter.

670
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,070
You need to swallow your pride and make friends.

671
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:15,510
In this way, you'll gradually have friends among the officials.

672
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:18,020
You also need to please Princess Jin Ming.

673
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,310
After all, Duke Chu loves his daughter so much.

674
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,230
For his future grandchildren,

675
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,880
he'll support you.

676
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,350
The emperor of An is almost 50 years old.

677
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,750
He hasn't chosen a crown prince.

678
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,610
But as long as the Liudao Hall takes action,

679
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,680
the two princes

680
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:33,110
will both suffer losses for the throne.

681
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,160
That time

682
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:40,010
will be the best time for you to become the second most powerful man

683
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,000
in the state.

684
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,110
With all due respect,

685
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,110
we all want to support

686
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:49,110
Third Prince, who're still an infant.

687
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,710
Working with me

688
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,440
is much better than working

689
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,080
with that consort.

690
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,190
You said so much

691
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,420
because you want me to help you bring back your emperor

692
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:07,320
when I take control.

693
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:09,360
You're right.

694
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:12,200
This is your reward.

695
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,280
But

696
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,350
I have to add one more condition.

697
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:20,830
From now on,

698
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:23,290
stop going against us

699
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,750
and stay away from Princess.

700
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,140
Don't have any ulterior motives.

701
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,710
You proposed this condition.

702
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,470
Are you deliberately making things difficult for me?

703
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,990
I'm deliberately making things difficult for you.

704
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:41,250
The person who're jealous of you bows down to you

705
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,900
and feels aggrieved and embarrassed.

706
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,390
Is there anything more joyful than this

707
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,290
in this world?

708
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:51,990
Marquis Changqing.

709
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:55,990
The state and the beauty.

710
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,040
Choose one.

711
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:05,160
I can't answer you now.

712
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,830
Alright. I didn't waste my time with you tonight.

713
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,750
I'll go back now.

714
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:18,950
Think about it.

715
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:20,270
Wait.

716
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,310
What's wrong?

717
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:25,890
Noble Consort Chu doesn't have an affair with me.

718
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,110
It's just a partnership.

719
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,030
I swear to God.

720
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:32,030
You don't have to explain this to me.

721
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,350
Does Princess know it?

722
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,080
It has nothing to do with you.

723
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,500
Then don't tell her.

724
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,690
Although I know it has nothing to do with her,

725
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,700
I don't want her to misunderstand.

726
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,710
Even though I know

727
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,450
that she just looks like my master,

728
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:56,270
I don't want to see her

729
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:58,110
looking at me with disdain anymore.

730
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:28,990
You're back.

731
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,110
Yes.

732
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,720
What are you looking at?

733
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,110
You look pretty.

734
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,160
My Ruyi

735
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:11,310
is really beautiful and handsome.

736
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,190
No wonder that boy can't forget you.

737
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:21,350
Are you jealous again?

738
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,790
Or did the conversation not go as planned?

739
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,030
I'm not jealous.

740
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,750
Am I always jealous?

741
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:30,620
In my eyes,

742
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,270
he's just a kid.

743
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,950
Although he's a little rebellious,

744
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,900
he'll be more obedient after a few more lessons.

745
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:39,840
You're talking like an elder.

746
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,550
To be honest,

747
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:48,050
although I hate him,

748
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:50,040
all these years,

749
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:53,460
he has really been missing you.

750
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:58,550
The love of young people is crazy

751
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:00,050
and unforgettable.

752
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:01,990
I'm kind of

753
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:05,700
envious of him.

754
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,280
I know.

755
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,970
The crueler I am to him,

756
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:15,810
the better it is for him.

757
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,020
We have to keep moving tomorrow.

758
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:24,430
Go to bed early.

759
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:39,030
I mean

760
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,710
I sleep in my room. You sleep in your room.

761
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:45,070
Weren't you waiting for me here just now?

762
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:45,770
I...

763
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,540
I'm back now. You can go back and sleep.

764
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:53,960
Rest early.

765
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,910
So there are times when you are incoherent.

766
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,590
Your back is sweating.

767
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,040
My back is sweating. Yes.

768
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:04,070
I... I've taken All-Purpose Antidote.

769
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,700
I don't have internal force during the seven days.

770
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,110
When I was scaring Li Tongguang,

771
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,280
my back was sweating.

772
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:17,390
That's true.

773
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,390
But I'll always be with you.

774
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:22,500
Whether you have martial art skills or not,

775
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:25,770
as long as I want to protect you, I can protect you.

776
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:30,270
Then I entrust myself to you.

777
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:31,370
Miss, please

778
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:33,490
cherish me more.

779
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,100
No problem.

780
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:40,430
It's dark. No one else is here.

781
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:42,550
Why don't you...

782
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:44,620
No. I haven't recovered yet.

783
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:45,520
When I recover...

784
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:51,390
I'm just kidding.

785
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:10,820
The emperor of An has always been ambitious.

786
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,590
According to the information from the Liudao Hall and Jinsha Pavilion,

787
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:15,390
after the battle between the State of An and the State of Wu,

788
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:17,590
he's even more interested in attacking the State of Chu.

789
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,120
When you arrive in the State of An

790
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:21,660
and enter the palace to see the emperor of An,

791
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:22,900
if he doesn't allow you to bring guards,

792
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:24,320
what will you do?

793
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,610
The first thing is to meet His Majesty

794
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:34,020
and make sure if His Majesty is safe.
