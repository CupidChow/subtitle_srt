[Episode 38]

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,229
[Two days later]

5
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,310
I'm willing to give the crown and accept the surrender.

6
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,830
What is he doing?

7
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,350
I'm bound by face.

8
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,970
You don't know that, do you, Beauty?

9
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,240
This is the custom of surrendering that was passed down from the previous dynasty.

10
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,490
Beipan lost

11
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,270
so they have to read the surrender letter seriously to the person who led the army

12
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,530
for it to be written into history.

13
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,040
So many people died.

14
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,090
Yet a victory

15
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,370
made the people so happy.

16
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,930
In a state of turmoil, a victory like this

17
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,510
has saved many lives.

18
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,680
So...

19
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:40,850
even if we don't know

20
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,350
when the next war will come,

21
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,760
being alive

22
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,760
is already a good thing for them.

23
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,120
Long live His Majesty!

24
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,280
Long live the Leader of Shaxi!

25
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,120
Long live His Majesty!

26
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,190
Long live the Leader of Shaxi!

27
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,260
What is this?

28
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:28,880
Your Majesty.

29
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,280
This is the crown of Left Worthy Prince.

30
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,100
Your Majesty!

31
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,800
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

32
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,550
Your Majesty! Hang in there!

33
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,360
Leader of Shaxi!

34
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,120
Leader of Shaxi! Hang in there!

35
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,360
Don't panic.

36
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,460
-Don't run around!
-Don't panic!

37
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,260
Don't panic!

38
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,560
Give it to...

39
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,120
Chu...

40
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:09,470
Yue...

41
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,270
Leader of Shaxi!

42
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,550
Your Majesty.

43
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:21,420
Your Majesty!

[The Liudao Hall delegation]

[To the Empress of Wu
His Majesty was assassinated on the 23rd of Layue at He County.]

46
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,550
[The Liudao Hall delegation]

47
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,360
[To Prime Minister Zhang
His Majesty was assassinated on the 23rd of Layue at He County.]

48
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:45,780
Gather all the guards

49
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,040
and follow me to the camp of west capital.

50
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:48,310
Your Highness!

51
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,480
I didn't want my brother to return.

52
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,720
But since we collaborated on the credence and fought enemies with him,

53
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,100
I've given up my desire to fight for the position of the emperor.

54
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,409
Now that my brother has passed away,

55
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,560
the country needs an emperor.

56
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,159
The officials will appoint a new emperor.

57
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,480
Zhang Song, that sly old fox, is fixated on court politics.

58
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,720
He won't let me ascend the throne easily.

59
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,160
He'll probably put a sin of

60
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,520
murdering the late emperor on me.

61
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,720
That's why I can only gather troops in the army.

62
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,640
Otherwise, I can't defend myself.

63
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,310
Yes.

64
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,080
Zhang Song?

65
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,640
Prince Danyang.

66
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,070
As the supervisor of the state,

67
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,620
how dare you commit treason?

68
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,580
It's unforgivable to murder the late emperor.

69
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,210
[Mansion of Prince Danyang]

70
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,690
Since I was entrusted by the late emperor to assist the regency,

71
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,860
I won't allow a rebel like you to exist in the world.

72
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:33,980
Go!

73
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:42,840
Prime Minister.

74
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,110
How about we let him live for now?

75
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,250
After all, Her Majesty hasn't given birth yet.

76
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,510
Her Majesty is almost at full-term.

77
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,110
A baby boy will be arranged tonight.

78
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,510
Tomorrow at the court,

79
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,900
the officials will hear about His Majesty's death

80
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,200
and then hear about the Empress giving birth.

81
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,200
When the Empress gives birth later,

82
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:02,490
if it's a boy,

83
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,830
we can just replace him.

84
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,630
If it's a daughter,

85
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,840
we will raise them for now

86
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,350
then find a boy to replace her from the royal family.

87
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,960
In that case,

88
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,520
it wouldn't count as messing up the royal bloodline.

89
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,280
Don't blame me for being cruel.

90
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,840
Every time the throne changes,

91
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,440
several princes and ministers will die.

92
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,160
In the past few months,

93
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,060
Prince Danyang and I had a lot of disputes in politics.

94
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,680
Do you think he can forgive me

95
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,950
after he ascends the throne?

96
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,659
The Jingyang bell...

97
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,200
Your Majesty, Prince Ying.

98
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,190
Tell your men to stop.

99
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,620
Something as major as the death of His Majesty

100
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,010
is none of you, a minister's business.

101
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,440
I can't do as you say.

102
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,440
Your Majesty.

103
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,390
This is not the time to be soft-hearted.

104
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,040
I think so too.

105
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:21,750
Prime Minister!

106
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:22,850
-Yanniang.
-Don’t move.

107
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,040
Wu.

108
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:27,740
Don't be afraid.

109
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,370
Your other wives and songs

110
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,120
are also at the palace.

111
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:53,760
Good. Very well.

112
00:07:57,659 --> 00:07:58,550
Tell them to stop.

113
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,159
Stop!

114
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,560
Brother, I got the news

115
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,710
and rushed to the palace

116
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,480
to get Sister-in-law to take charge of the situation.

117
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,550
His Majesty passed away,

118
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,970
You're a Prince, and he's a Cabinet Grand Secretary.

119
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,160
You weren't thinking about mourning, but were in a hurry to fight.

120
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,160
Do you think the turmoil Wu is in is not bad enough?

121
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,750
Get them two sets of plain clothes to change into.

122
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:39,580
Yes.

123
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,950
Your uncle Marquis Yongping is also in my hands.

124
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,960
Your Highness, what do you want?

125
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,280
Please speak your mind.

126
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,060
Aren't you fighting

127
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,260
just for the throne behind His Majesty?

128
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,660
If that's the case,

129
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,520
as the Empress,

130
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,500
I shall summon all officials to the court on behalf of the late emperor

131
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,270
so that you can fight for it.

132
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,110
Go back to the palace quickly.

133
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,920
Her Majesty has arrived.

134
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,720
Greetings, Your Majesty.

135
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,280
Everyone,

136
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,460
I summoned you all to the palace for one thing.

137
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,560
His Majesty defeated Beipan in the State of An

138
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,320
and defended He County.

139
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,000
But unfortunately,

140
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,480
he was injured by a Beipan assassin

141
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,440
and passed away

142
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,940
four days ago.

143
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,500
His Majesty passed away?

144
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,670
But didn't His Majesty just send a letter back to the court a few days ago?

145
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,840
Why did he suddenly...

146
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,130
Could it be a mistake?

147
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,070
I dare not

148
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,040
joke about such an important matter.

149
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,830
Prime Minister Zhang and Prince Danyang can testify.

150
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,280
My condolences, Your Highness.

151
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,160
Please rise.

152
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,910
Although I'm heartbroken,

153
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,320
I can't let my own pain

154
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,910
delay the national affairs.

155
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,430
The current affairs

156
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,370
are just the Beipan people invading Central Plain.

157
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,800
So I have something

158
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,480
to ask Prince Danyang and Prime Minister Zhang

159
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,680
as to how the things will be dealt with after the way.

160
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,790
Although Beipan's Left Worthy Prince has died,

161
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,030
their king won't give up easily.

162
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,960
They will only attack more strongly.

163
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,180
If He County is defeated,

164
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,580
there will be a catastrophe in both Wu and An.

165
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,240
So I think

166
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,590
we should send reinforcements to He County immediately

167
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:08,440
so that we won't let His Majesty's sacrifice down.

168
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,840
I think

169
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,520
since the mountain collapsed,

170
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,200
it would be better for Wu to guard the situation.

171
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,400
Although the Beipan people are aggressive,

172
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,460
their next step will probably be

173
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,320
heading to the State of An's Junzhou's Guideyuan

174
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,600
which is better to attack,

175
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,640
We should use this chance to save our strength

176
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,480
to find a way out

177
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,880
as a long-term solution.

178
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,280
Nonsense!

179
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,870
Our country and An just made an alliance

180
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,200
to fight the enemy together.

181
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,440
How can you break our promise?

182
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,470
There is only interests between the two states.

183
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,460
There is no morality.

184
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,520
If the An people keep their promises,

185
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,940
why did they still imprison

186
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,440
His Majesty and Prince Li in the State of An

187
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,200
for so many days even after we have paid for the ransom?

188
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,630
It's Princess Licheng.

189
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,070
If a treaty can be changed and abandoned as one wishes,

190
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,620
how do you expect Ying who just became Duke Qing's wife

191
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,240
at the State of An to handle things herself?

192
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,220
What makes you think

193
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,100
Beipan will only touch Beipan

194
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,770
instead of coveting Wu?

195
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:01,960
Prime Minister Zhang,

196
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,960
when Beipan people invaded last time,

197
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,420
their horses trampled 19 Zhous of An and Wu.

198
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,710
I only know

199
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,120
war requires military funds.

200
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,230
The military funds spent at Tianmenguan

201
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,320
plus the 100,000 taels of gold to bring His Majesty back

202
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,440
has already emptied the treasury.

203
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,680
If we send troops again,

204
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,480
the Ministry of Revenue won't be able to hold out.

205
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,400
I understand

206
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,660
your thoughts.

207
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,540
National affairs are family matters.

208
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,390
Since His Majesty is gone,

209
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,680
the country can't live without an leader.

210
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,680
So I

211
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,280
recommend Prince Danyang to ascend the throne.

212
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,440
No, Your Highness.

213
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,440
His Majesty was suddenly assassinated.

214
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,700
There are many things suspicious about it.

215
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,240
I have suspected that

216
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,540
that Prince Danyang was behind His Majesty's death.

217
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,480
But I know

218
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,520
among the 5,000 soldiers

219
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,220
sent to assist His Majesty in He County,

220
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,840
their leader is the trusted aide of Prince Danyang.

221
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,240
If Prince Danyang wanted to do something to His Majesty,

222
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,760
why wait until

223
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,540
when Beipan's Left Worthy Prince has already surrendered his sword?

224
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,160
Was there no better opportunity

225
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,550
during the chaos?

226
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,310
According to our ancestors' legacy,

227
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,930
to be under Beipan people's horses and words,

228
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,830
regardless of your gender or age,

229
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,050
you are all dead souls.

230
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,320
Prime Minister Zhang.

231
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,190
In order to resist Beipan People,

232
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,400
His Majesty fought to death outside the gate.

233
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,110
Princess Licheng

234
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,400
also married Duke An

235
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,330
of the State of An for the two state's alliance.

236
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,190
Do you know

237
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,690
when the king is humiliated, the ministers should die.

238
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,290
I was negligent.

239
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,490
I dare not.

240
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,590
To be honest,

241
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,030
in this world,

242
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,800
there is no one who does not want

243
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,780
Prince Danyang to ascend to throne as much as I do.

244
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,090
But I also know

245
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,430
facing the Beipan enemies,

246
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,560
we are cornered and if we don't do anything, we will be retreating.

247
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,600
Ministers,

248
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,580
don't forget the legacy of our ancestors

249
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,940
and the elders.

250
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,760
Your Majesty has a deep understanding of righteousness.

251
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,880
We admire you.

252
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,640
Prince Danyang,

253
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,040
can you swear before the ancestral temple

254
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,580
that you will be kind to both me and my child.

255
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,480
You won't kill nor imprison us

256
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,210
and keep us safe forever.

257
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,410
And that you will definitely use Prime Minister Zhang and the loyal officials

258
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,760
as they were

259
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,140
without any resentment

260
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,380
to expel Beipan

261
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,800
and restore the peace of the Central Plain.

262
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,750
I'm willing to swear with my blood.

263
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,540
After I ascend the throne, I will lead the army immediately.

264
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,950
I will never return to Wu Capital until I succeed in defeating Beipan.

265
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:18,920
During this period,

266
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,920
all national affairs will be entrusted to the Empress and Prime Minister Zhang.

267
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,120
Prime Minister Zhang, what do you think?

268
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,620
I'm willing to follow the royal family and Sister-in-law,

269
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,540
Please ascend the throne, Brother Danyang.

270
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,100
The military situation is urgent.

271
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,500
But the etiquette cannot be neglected.

272
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,780
Because my sister-in-law is understanding,

273
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,320
the funeral of the late Emperor

274
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,750
needs more preparation for a proper mourning.

275
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,120
I'm incompetent.

276
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,100
I'm willing to take the position of a legitimate heir to handle state mourning.

277
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,880
During this period,

278
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,190
you can deploy troops as the new emperor.

279
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,710
We agree.

280
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,790
Approved.

281
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,360
In that case,

282
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,600
please go to the ancestral temple

283
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,520
to perform the ritual.

284
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,390
I don't know

285
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,720
if my choice was right.

286
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:21,730
But,

287
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,480
since the imperial physician said the child is 90% a girl,

288
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,400
I can only

289
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,020
bet with her and

290
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,940
the future of Wu.

291
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,270
I hope the new emperor

292
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,980
can spare us

293
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,960
for my contribution on helping him ascend the throne.

294
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,640
Your Majesty is wise and decisive.

295
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,230
If His Majesty were aware of this in heaven...

296
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,410
Your Majesty.

297
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,850
Your Majesty... Blood...

298
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,720
I felt something was wrong in the court just now.

299
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,450
Call the imperial physician.

300
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,360
We must keep the baby.

301
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:11,950
Your Majesty.

302
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,890
His Majesty cares about relationships.

303
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,360
Yes, in terms of politics, he's pretty good too.

304
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,040
Prime Minister Zhang,

305
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,230
what's done is done.

306
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,040
Just take it easy.

307
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,440
His Majesty has sworn to the heavens.

308
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,860
Your words will still hold a lot of weight.

309
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,500
Dear Ancestors,

310
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,000
Yang Xingjian, the 11th son of the Yang family.

311
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,480
was recommended by hundreds of officials today...

312
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:44,870
Guards!

313
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,420
Guards!

314
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,400
The plaque has bestowed the sins to His Majesty!

315
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,080
Guards! Guards!

316
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,890
Imperial physician... Get the imperial physician!

317
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,040
Where is the imperial physician?

318
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,230
-He's here.
-Get the imperial physician!

319
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,040
Imperial Physician, hurry!

320
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,990
He didn't hurt his neck.

321
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,160
His life is fine for now.

322
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,630
But I'm afraid his lungs have been heavily hit.

323
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,280
Hurry, send him to the hospital. Hurry.

324
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,360
Send him to Prince Danyang's Mansion.

325
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:07,960
No!

326
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,830
If my sister-in-law and I hadn't arrived in time,

327
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,130
you would have wanted to kill him in front of Second Brother's residence this morning.

328
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,030
Just now in the court,

329
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,440
you were against my brother's ascension to the throne too.

330
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,060
I can't entrust my brother to yo.

331
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,340
Send him to my mansion,

332
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,790
I'll take care of Second Brother myself.

333
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:21,410
Wait.

334
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,520
Prime Minister Zhang,

335
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,160
It's still unknown whether His Majesty's life is in danger.

336
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,820
I'm afraid you're suspicious.

337
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,990
What are you waiting for?

338
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,200
Hurry up.

339
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,150
Hurry.

340
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,150
Hurry.

341
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,480
Your Highness.

342
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,370
Thank you for waiting outside.

343
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,000
His Majesty's situation has finally stabilized.

344
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,720
But he's still unconscious.

345
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,110
How is Sister-in-law?

346
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:10,180
She went into the delivery room four hours ago.

347
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,280
But there's no news yet.

348
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,850
The imperial physician said it was an obstructed labor.

349
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,590
We want to go in.

350
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,630
But the Yulin Army said that Her Majesty had ordered

351
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,630
to stop us from entering the palace.

352
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,270
Yes.

353
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:23,850
I'll go.

354
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,240
Okay.

355
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:26,770
Your Highness.

356
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:27,850
How dare you!

357
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,440
My sister-in-law is delivering.

358
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,280
As a royal command,

359
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,090
I have the responsibility to supervise.

360
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:37,920
Why?

361
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,680
Isn't the leader of Wu surnamed Yang?

362
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:42,690
Please, Your Highness.

363
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,540
Please wait a moment.

364
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,010
If there is any news,

365
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,980
I'll send an attendant to inform you.

366
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,580
Thank you, Your Highness.

367
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,730
What's wrong with you?

368
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,400
Hurry up and prepare some seats and food

369
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,760
for the officials.

370
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,290
Yes.

371
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,430
Go get them ready.

372
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,310
Yes.

373
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,890
Now that Prince Ying is here, we can have a backbone.

374
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,110
Fortunately, Prince Ying is here to be in charge of the overall situation.

375
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:13,490
However,

376
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,410
things are happening to the late emperor, to His Majesty, and then Her Majesty...

377
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,750
Could it be...

378
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,920
the Heaven is going to destroy Wu?

379
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,550
Exactly...

380
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,400
Well done.

381
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,940
You're indeed my most trusted subordinate.

382
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,390
I will treat you well in the future.

383
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,360
Thank you.

384
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,540
Your Majesty, try harder.

385
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:46,900
Try harder.

386
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,720
Push harder.

387
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:49,710
Your Majesty.

388
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,570
The feet came out first.

389
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,400
Your Majesty, hang in there.

390
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:57,920
It's upside down.

391
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,830
Your Majesty, hang in there.

392
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,820
Your Highness, it'll be over soon.

393
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,540
Her Majesty's blood is gushing out!

394
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,780
Your Majesty.

395
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,500
You must hang in there!

396
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,310
Hang in there!

397
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,440
Your Highness, it'll be over soon.

398
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,430
Your Highness.

399
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,560
How is it?

400
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,320
It's as Your Highness wished.

401
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,320
Your Highness, are you not feeling well?

402
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,480
I have ginseng juice.

403
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,350
Have a sip.

404
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,180
I've been ill since I was a child.

405
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,130
I always bring this with me.

406
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,120
Your Majesty, take a sip.

407
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,850
Her Majesty fainted.

408
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,470
Your Majesty! Your Majesty, wake up!

409
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,210
Your Majesty!

410
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,970
-What should we do?
-Your Majesty!

411
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:54,510
Your Majesty.

412
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,810
Make sure Sister-in-law can't give birth.

413
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:56,980
Yes.

414
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:02,350
Sister-in-law, you must hang in there.

415
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,990
I'm outside.

416
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,080
Prince Danyang didn't hold out.

417
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,160
Wu would be on your hands, Sister-in-law!

418
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,400
Your Highness.

419
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,060
Her Majesty just woke up.

420
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,720
I'm afraid it's terminal lucidity.

421
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,150
I would like to ask Your Highness to enter

422
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:25,930
and ask for a will.

423
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:28,740
Your Highness.

424
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,920
Your Highness, please.

425
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:31,950
Sister-in-law.

426
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,340
She was a princess...

427
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,240
She was just born and she...

428
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,120
Sister-in-law.

429
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,430
Why are you crying?

430
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,870
I'm unlucky.

431
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,800
Xingyan.

432
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:04,490
I can't hold out anymore.

433
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:06,720
Come here.

434
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,360
I have something to tell you.

435
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,280
You may leave now.

436
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:15,300
Yes.

437
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:49,630
Yan.

438
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,810
Just before I die,

439
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:12,000
I suddenly figured out a lot of things.

440
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,160
My miscarriage

441
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,190
and all these...

442
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,920
did you do all these?

443
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,520
Why ask the obvious?

444
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,320
Why?

445
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,590
All these years,

446
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,910
we have treated you well.

447
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,120
Well?

448
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,240
But I don't care about your charity at all.

449
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,780
In terms of background,

450
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,090
my mother has the highest status.

451
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,840
In terms of talent,

452
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,860
I'm ten times better than my two brothers.

453
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,630
But because of my kindness when I was eight,

454
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,220
and I wanted to save you who fell into the water,

455
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,330
I became crippled all my life

456
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,220
and can never get to be the emperor.

457
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,920
You owe me a life.

458
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,350
But why would you rather recommend

459
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,760
Prince Danyang who came from a lowly background

460
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,640
and have never thought of me?

461
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,760
You deserve this.

462
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,720
Retribution.

463
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:21,770
It's all retribution.

464
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,440
So,

465
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,190
the death of His Majesty

466
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:35,000
was also done by you,

467
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:36,750
Of course.

468
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,990
You didn't expect that, did you?

469
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,990
I've been plotting even before

470
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,410
when Yang Ying departed.

471
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,720
I found that

472
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,480
Qian Zhao hates Big Brother.

473
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,180
It was me who told him

474
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,590
not to let that foolish emperor who disgraced Wu

475
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,590
to return to Wu Capital.

476
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,980
Unfortunately,

477
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:02,320
I don’t know what happened to Qian Zhao during his journey

478
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,670
and he didn't let him die at He County,

479
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,940
yet letting him live for almost a month more.

480
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:08,930
However,

481
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,420
to arrange for someone in the support army

482
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,540
to pass gunpowder to Left Worthy Prince who only wants revenge

483
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,360
is nothing difficult.

484
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:21,990
What you have done have let down Wu

485
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:25,250
and the people.

486
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,620
Wu did me wrong.

487
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,240
I don’t care for so much.

488
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,350
I just want to be the emperor of Wu.

489
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,580
As long as you all die,

490
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,130
all the officials will have to support me.

491
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,780
Didn't you see how grateful

492
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,080
they were to me?

493
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,520
I've been an incompetent Worthy Prince for so many years.

494
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,520
No one will suspect me.

495
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,600
Is that so?

496
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,120
Did everyone hear

497
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,910
Prince Ying's confession?

498
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,040
I thought I was a wise man.

499
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,020
I didn't expect there to be a poisonous snake

500
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,550
just under my seat.

501
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,650
Second Brother... Second Brother!

502
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,440
Don't kill me.

503
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,440
I was just muddled.

504
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,760
I just want to be like you too much

505
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,370
and have a taste of having power.

506
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,960
I'm only 22 years old.

507
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:00,950
I haven't lived enough.

508
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,940
Sorry, my hand slipped.

509
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,670
I know you Wu people always talk too much.

510
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,080
Who knows?

511
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,970
You might need to go through the Imperial Clan Court or the Grand Court.

512
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:36,100
Might as well let an outsider like me

513
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,100
be the bad person for you.

514
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:42,800
Record this down.

515
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,120
Prince Ying's illness relapsed

516
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,460
and died in the palace.

517
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,590
No.

518
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,930
Prince Ying plotted a rebellion

519
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,310
and was killed personally by me.

520
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,570
He killed the late emperor

521
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,120
and almost

522
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,120
killed me and my child.

523
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,740
You want to leave him some dignity.

524
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,160
But I

525
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,620
want to cut him into pieces

526
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,980
to relieve my hatred.

527
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,560
Your Majesty.

528
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,720
When the late emperor passed away,

529
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,600
he gave me a command.

530
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,240
I have no virtue

531
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:38,920
and have let Wu down.

532
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,920
My brother Yang Xingjian

533
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,560
is wise and decisive.

534
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,440
He will surely be able to succeed in commanding

535
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,540
and help continue the throne

536
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,370
by ascending to it.

537
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:59,750
I only hope everyone can work together to fight the enemy

538
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,340
so that you won't let me down.

539
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,030
Respect this.

540
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,390
Wait.

541
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,760
This was written by His Majesty personally.

542
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,800
Look at the flower seal.

543
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,370
There's a personal seal here too.

544
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,950
Her Majesty has sharp eyes.

545
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,380
You knew what the late emperor wanted.

546
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,710
I'm willing to serve the new emperor

547
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,070
and be loyal to the new emperor.

548
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,940
Long live His Majesty!

549
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,320
Long live Your Majesty!

550
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,160
Rise.

551
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,010
Thank you, Your Majesty.

552
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,080
I almost died this time.

553
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:26,150
I know how to respect the people.

554
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,630
I should follow the late emperor's order

555
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,070
and fight against Beipan with the whole country.

556
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,420
Pass my order.

557
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,760
Prince Ying was executed for treason.

558
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,920
He has been demoted to a commoner and expelled from the royal family.

559
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:42,440
All the assets in his mansion will be used for military expenses.

560
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,030
Yes, Your Majesty.

561
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,280
Your Majesty.

562
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,300
The late Emperor's coffin

563
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,920
is being escorted by the people of Liudao Hall.

564
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,260
They are now in Lingzhou.

565
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,330
Please issue a decree to send the officers to wait for it.

566
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:57,790
Proceed.

567
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,240
As for the funeral,

568
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,250
I will leave it to Her Majesty.

569
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,530
Could I ask Brother to stay in the funeral palace for the time being?

570
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,440
If I don't return this time,

571
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:14,620
combine the two funerals to become one.

572
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:17,070
It can also save some military expenses for Wu.

573
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,600
If anything happens to me,

574
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:21,710
the Empress will decide

575
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,710
who succeeds the throne.

576
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,790
Your Majesty, don't say such ominous words.

577
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,670
Prime Minister Zhang, no need to say more.

578
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,719
The national affairs should be dealt with.

579
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:38,050
It's my duty to make these things clear

580
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:40,210
before I set off.

581
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:43,880
Besides,

582
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,040
Official Ning escorted the late emperor's will this time

583
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,080
and exposed Prince Ying's conspiracy.

584
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,960
He made great contributions to the country.

585
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,120
Promote Ning Yuanzhou to Marquis Jingyuan.

586
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:56,510
And Ren Ruyi will be Lady Ning.

587
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:03,670
Thank you, Your Majesty.

588
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,900
But I ask Your Majesty to withdraw your order.

589
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:09,970
What Ruyi did

590
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,750
was her choice.

591
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,100
Not under as my wife.

592
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:16,250
That's right.

593
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,840
Yuanzhou and I rushed over

594
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:20,730
not for any reward.

595
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,370
We just want to stop a conspiracy

596
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:24,540
as ordinary people

597
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:27,100
to contribute to the peace of the Central Plain.

598
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,800
Your Majesty.

599
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,950
When we set off from He County,

600
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,180
Beipan's king

601
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,060
has named a new Left Worthy Prince

602
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,040
and ordered him to continue attacking the Central Plain.

603
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,230
Because the Leader of Shaxi died in the battle,

604
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,000
and the Shazhong Tribe rebelled halfway,

605
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,810
Duke Qing of An, Li Tongguang, suffered casualties in his army.

606
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,000
He just arrived in He County three days ago to meet with the people.

607
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,510
Over thousands of people in He Xian died too.

608
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,470
Therefore,

609
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,020
I beg Your Majesty to send troops

610
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,650
to assist He County.

611
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,080
Don't worry, Minister Ren.

612
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,960
Wu and An have a brotherly alliance

613
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,420
and we are now also connected by a marriage.

614
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,470
Wait for me to count the troops and horses.

615
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:15,310
I will lead the army to fight the enemy personally.

616
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,430
During this period,

617
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,080
I will entrust the state affairs

618
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:28,520
to the Empress and Prime Minister Zhang.

619
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,130
Yes.

620
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,500
By personally going to fight against the enemy,

621
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,170
Your Majesty is contributing to both states.

622
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,880
I hope Your Majesty can eradicate the chaos in the Central Plain as soon as possible

623
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,480
and save the people from suffering.

624
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:47,480
I

625
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,400
will serve with my life.

626
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,880
We will serve with our lives!

627
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,210
We are faster so we will set off first

628
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,090
to meet up with the soldiers of He County as soon as possible.

629
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:02,570
Also,

630
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,740
I also want to bring some long-time men of the Liudao Hall

631
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,580
to go with us.

632
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:07,100
Prime Minister Zhang.

633
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,470
Speed is the key to war.

634
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,370
Please take the commander’s seal, Official Ning,

635
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,790
and make it to He County as soon as possible

636
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,800
to send reinforcements to aid the State of An.

637
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:28,680
Thank you, Your Majesty.

638
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,050
Please tell Duke Qing,

639
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,330
in five days,

640
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,630
I will personally lead 20,000 troops to reinforce.

641
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:36,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

642
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:54,910
Marquis Jingyuan.

643
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,020
May I have a word with you?

644
00:37:58,570 --> 00:37:58,980
Okay.

645
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,780
I'll wait for you here.

646
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,370
Okay.

647
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,210
This is the antidote for the Ten-Day Qianji.

648
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,240
Although I think

649
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,510
you probably don't need it anymore.

650
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:48,700
Having it

651
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,730
is better than nothing.

652
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:55,530
But Prime Minister,

653
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,860
I failed to do

654
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,810
what you asked me to do.

655
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,040
Please forgive me.

656
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,410
You saved my life

657
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,980
from Prince Ying.

658
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,230
Why talk about this?

659
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,570
But

660
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,820
I just want to know one thing.

661
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,510
Is the late emperor's will

662
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,760
real?

663
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,030
It's real.

664
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,210
Very well.

665
00:39:58,820 --> 00:39:59,300
But...

666
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,900
there is one more.

667
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:28,230
I have two last orders.

668
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:31,310
One to pass the throne to Prince Danyang

669
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:34,330
and the other the pass the throne to

670
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,610
the Prince that is not born yet.

671
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,680
It's up to you to decide...

672
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,830
who it's given to.

673
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,000
I...

674
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,510
trust you.

675
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,400
Yuan Lu, Sun Lang, Qian Zhao,

676
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,120
and the late emperor

677
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,440
died fighting against Beipan.

678
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,120
Yang Ying too.

679
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,870
She married Li Tongguang

680
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,040
for efforts to fight against the enemy.

681
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,120
As for which will edit I passed on,

682
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:34,630
after I returned to Wu Capital,

683
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:36,360
I learned about the dispute you

684
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:39,250
and Prince Danyang had in the court,

685
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,320
which helped me made my decision.

686
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,020
I see.

687
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,160
I've been running around for power for half my life.

688
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:11,630
But I didn't expect

689
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:14,740
I lost at the last moment.

690
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:18,760
Forget it.

691
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:20,840
Let's get down to business.

692
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,110
Although you are in charge of Liudao Hall,

693
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:26,090
you may not be able to command

694
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,470
those generals that can help with army reinforcements along the way, right?

695
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,960
Let me tell you about them.

696
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:35,750
Okay.

697
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:36,270
Here.
