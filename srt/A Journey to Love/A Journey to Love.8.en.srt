[A Journey To Love]

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,880
[Episode 8]

4
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,180
General, slow down.

5
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,000
The soldiers behind can't keep up.

6
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,940
Then tell them to run faster!

7
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,640
Ning Yuanzhou is such a jerk!

8
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,590
He actually played me!

9
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,050
How long until we reach Shuzhou?

10
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,310
We're going 15 miles per hour

11
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,440
and are about 60 miles from Shuzhou.

12
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,220
So it'll take at least four hours.

13
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,170
When we sent out the messenger pigeon,

14
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,740
Zhou Jian had passed Bashili Fortress.

15
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,070
In other words,

16
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,050
he's just 2 hours away from us.

17
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,620
He'll catch up.

18
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,320
A tough battle is inevitable.

19
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,030
Yuan Lu.

20
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,450
Give me two thunderbombs.

21
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,300
We have one more hour now.

22
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,050
Well done.

23
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,190
Sun Lang.

24
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,640
Do that again at suitable places ahead.

25
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,250
We're not going to Shuzhou.

26
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,040
We'll go to Tianxing Gorge.

27
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,610
Zhou Jian has an army of 1,000.

28
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,630
[Tianxing Gorge, the State of Wu]

29
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,790
Apart from the princess, Mr. Du,

30
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,870
and a few others who don't know martial arts,

31
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,140
only 60 people in the delegation can fight.

32
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,430
So if we split into two groups,

33
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,600
they'll split up to come after us as well.

34
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,250
I was here at Tianxing Gorge with my godfather 10 years ago.

35
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,140
It's about one kilometer long.

36
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,350
The narrowest place is only about 6 meters wide.

37
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,190
Only four horses can pass it at the same time.

38
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,300
So by ambushing them at different places,

39
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,590
we can divide Zhou Jian's long lines of troops.

40
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,240
We're outnumbered,

41
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,550
but we can still win.

42
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,190
I can lead several men to distract them.

43
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:49,750
I've brought some trapping devices with me.

44
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,850
Boss, I can ambush them at the entrance of the gorge.

45
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,060
Okay.

46
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,060
I'll protect Her Highness.

47
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,900
60 against 500.

48
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,370
At least half of your men will die or get injured.

49
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:58,850
Why are you

50
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,960
willing to put them in danger this time?

51
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,010
As the chief, it's my duty

52
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,070
to make sure no one dies for nothing

53
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,150
when casualties are inevitable.

54
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,070
Besides, only by winning this battle

55
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,430
can we keep Prince Danyang

56
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,650
off the delegation's back for a while.

57
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,490
How can I help?

58
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,520
Beauty, you're from the State of Chu after all.

59
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,160
It's fine for you to help us ward off assassins,

60
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,070
but this is a conflict within the State of Wu.

61
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,270
The battle later is gonna be fierce.

62
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:24,830
If you get hurt…

63
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,440
You said

64
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,350
we're partners.

65
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,050
Fine.

66
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,950
I need you to take someone's life.

67
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,370
Your target

68
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,090
is Zhou Jian.

69
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,140
Deeper.

70
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:53,680
Okay.

71
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,520
It's done.

72
00:05:58,970 --> 00:05:59,610
Is this enough?

73
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:11,640
Boss.

74
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,110
No. I'm not leaving.

75
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,290
Your Highness. Your Highness!

76
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,070
Yuan…

77
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,360
Mr. Ning.

78
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,140
I don't want to leave with Mr. Du and Commandant Qian.

79
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,670
I want to stay

80
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,310
to face the enemies with you.

81
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,100
Be good.

82
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,500
Our duty is to make sure

83
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,190
you and Mr. Du safely arrive in the State of An.

84
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:49,030
But I'm the leader of the delegation.

85
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,240
If I leave you and run for my life,

86
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,330
what will become of me?

87
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:53,730
Besides,

88
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,310
if worst comes to worst

89
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,720
and something happens to you guys,

90
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,840
can Commandant Qian alone

91
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,870
keep me and Mr. Du safe

92
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,220
in the State of An?

93
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,830
Yuanzhou.

94
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,210
You keep saying that I need to be brave

95
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,650
and fulfill my duties.

96
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,390
I'm finally not afraid of death this time.

97
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,270
Just let me stay with you guys.

98
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,230
She's right.

99
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,040
You have your duties.

100
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,630
She has hers as part of the royal family.

101
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,290
Witnessing the battle can help her

102
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,640
manifest more composure in the State of An.

103
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:41,950
Fine.

104
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,820
Be careful.

105
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,060
Qian Zhao.

106
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:50,010
Yes.

107
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,150
You'll lie in ambush in the middle.

108
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:51,710
Okay.

109
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,230
Ding Hui.

110
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,990
Yes.

111
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,100
Later, take Prince Li and Mr. Du

112
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,690
to a safe place behind the gorge.

113
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:00,460
Okay.

114
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:09,870
Take this.

115
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,290
Curl up in a ball when arrows come your way.

116
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,480
You're least likely to get hurt that way.

117
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,410
If someone tries to hurt you,

118
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:16,980
hit them here.

119
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,070
God bless.

120
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,730
God bless.

121
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,700
What's taken Yu Shisan so long?

122
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,080
It's fifteen minutes later than we expected.

123
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,780
I made some laxative medicines just now

124
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,780
and asked him to put them in the river by the fork.

125
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,490
The soldiers have trudged a long way here

126
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,670
and must be exhausted.

127
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,970
When they see the water at the fork,

128
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,970
they'll definitely drink it.

129
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,700
They're Wu people too,

130
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:52,750
so I didn't use poison.

131
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,920
But they'll be at least 30 percent weaker.

132
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,360
Report!

133
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,080
General.

134
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,450
A farmer ahead said an hour ago,

135
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:06,850
he saw dozens of people passing by

136
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,460
with a four-in-hand carriage.

137
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:13,600
Form up!

138
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,580
General.

139
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,440
Prince Li's carriage is pulled by two horses.

140
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,830
But the wheel tracks on the road to Tianxing Gorge

141
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:39,760
are obviously deeper.

142
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,340
They must have split into two groups.

143
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:42,540
One group escorts Prince Li.

144
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,690
The other group transports the gold.

145
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,260
After leaving Tianxing Gorge,

146
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,210
they can meet at Liu Town in Lingzhou.

147
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,330
General.

148
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,590
Which way should we go?

149
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,700
Ning Yuanzhou is cunning.

150
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,550
He knows I'll come after him

151
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,960
and Prince Li.

152
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,880
He's trying to mislead me into turning left.

153
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,700
On my command.

154
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,410
Take 300 men with you and go left.

155
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,150
The rest 700 soldiers

156
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,610
will go to Tianxing Gorge with me!

157
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:07,370
Yes.

158
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,220
Let's go.

159
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:28,830
Let's do it.

160
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:29,640
Yes.

161
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,670
That's Prince Li's carriage.

162
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,980
It's right ahead. Go get them!

163
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,790
Ambush!

164
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:07,590
Stop!

165
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,750
We surrender!

166
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,220
We surrender.

167
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,620
My stomach hurts.

168
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,130
The water was poisoned!

169
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,530
Poisoned?

170
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,730
The water was poisoned.

171
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,060
We've been poisoned.

172
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,570
Don't panic!

173
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,670
Maintain military discipline!

174
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,550
Keep going.

175
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,720
Anyone who disobeys will be executed.

176
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,190
Send out scouts.

177
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:37,980
Yes.

178
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,150
Go.

179
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,450
Disperse!

180
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,690
Protect the general!

181
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,490
Fight!

182
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,430
Patty-cake.

183
00:15:59,010 --> 00:15:59,930
Patty-cake. Baker's man.

184
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,250
Bake these men as fast as you can.

185
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,390
God bless.

186
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,400
Ruyi!

187
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,600
Help! Help!

188
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,010
Your Highness.

189
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,180
Sorry. Sorry.

190
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,560
Your Highness. Your Highness.

191
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,270
Your Highness.

192
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:34,420
Mr. Du.

193
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,040
I didn't know you were good with a bow.

194
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,340
Archery is one of the six skills a Confucian scholar is supposed to master.

195
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,260
I practiced it when I was young.

196
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:42,970
Your Highness.

197
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,240
How can Prince Danyang be so cruel to his family?

198
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,020
Even a civilian official like me has been forced to kill.

199
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,770
He has no heart.

200
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,170
Soldiers, on my command.

201
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,060
Keep the defensive formation and retreat slowly.

202
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,170
Back.

203
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:07,750
Back.

204
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,460
Back.

205
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:15,790
We need to cut off the head of the snake.

206
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:35,760
Kill!

207
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,050
Stop them.

208
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:46,650
Kill!

209
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,770
♫They stab me in the back but I'll come back stronger♫

210
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:02,020
♫My roar shakes the ground when I wield my sword♫

211
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,360
♫They say I have no future but I'll rock the world♫

212
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:09,100

♫There is no right or wrong♫

215
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,020
Keep the formation!

♫There is no right or wrong♫

217
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,050
Don't panic!

218
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,210
There are too many soldiers around Zhou Jian.

219
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,080
I can't get past them.

220
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,650
At least 300 of them can still fight.

221
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,190
♫They stab me in the back but I'll come back stronger♫

222
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,970
I'll cover you. Let's go.

♫My roar shakes the ground when I wield my sword♫

224

You all right?

228
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,450
Yes.

229
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,550
Strike once.

230
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:04,670
♫There is no right or wrong♫

231
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:01,940
Strike twice.

00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,110
Time for you halfwits to meet death.

♫There is no right or wrong♫

234
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,530
Watch out!

235
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,980
No!

236
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,040
I thought you were not coming back!

237
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,670
The most handsome man

238
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,940
usually doesn't show up until the last minute.

239
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,300
Archers!

240
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,020
There's cover over there.

241
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,160
Send 10 men to capture Prince Li alive.

242
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:38,780
Yes.

243
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,180
You guys, go!

244
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,500
We must take down Zhou Jian immediately.

245
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,110
Otherwise, we'll all die.

246
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,580
I can get to him from above.

247
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:57,810
I need you to give me a foothold.

248
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:58,820
Throw me out with all your strength.

249
00:22:59,230 --> 00:22:59,690
No.

250
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,280
When you're in the air,

251
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,430
you can't dodge arrows.

252
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,330
Then can you go above?

253
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:05,800
You're much heavier than me.

254
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:06,720
You can't leap over the rocks.

255
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:07,620
No.

256
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09,130
It's a conflict within the State of Wu.

257
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,520
You don't have to get yourself killed for it.

258
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,820
It's the most efficient solution.

259
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,240
But it's not the best solution.

260
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,720
And you promised me

261
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,390
to follow my lead.

262
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,620
Ning Yuanzhou.

263
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,250
If you help me get to him,

264
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,040
I won't force you to have a baby with me anymore.

265
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:26,870
Help me.

266
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:35,080
♫The moon has set, and you have left♫

Prince Li is the royal family's envoy.

280
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,090
Zhou Jian attempted to harm the prince

281
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,110
and has been taken under control.

282
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,030
Drop your weapons now

283
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,610
and I can spare your lives.

We won! We won!

296
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,220
Yuan Lu.

297
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,620
Yuan Lu!

298
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,080
[Lingyun Inn, Lingzhou]

299
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:28,780
Be careful.

300
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,660
Boss, the ginseng soup is here.

301
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,050
This is the nearest inn to Tianxing Gorge.

302
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,160
I've sent someone to see the regional inspector.

303
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,290
He'll come within two hours.

304
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,480
The regional inspector of Lingzhou was Zhang Song's student.

305
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,470
We're in his jurisdiction.

306
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,030
Cut the number of night sentries in half.

307
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:50,640
Okay.

308
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,130
The Scarlet Guards are quite influential in this area.

309
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,710
Tell the delegation to move into the west wing.

310
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,440
Got it. I'll arrange it.

311
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,200
What's wrong with Yuan Lu?

312
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,930
He was born with heart disease

313
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,320
and should avoid being too excited or tired.

314
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,130
The candies he takes every day

315
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,120
are actually pills.

316
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,660
That's why

317
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,320
everyone treats him so well.

318
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,410
Can't you find a good physician to cure him?

319
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,330
The imperial physician said

320
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,150
he needs to make it to 20 years old first.

321
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,760
In other words,

322
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:46,220
he may die before he's 20.

323
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,460
Isn't he worried at all?

324
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:12,880
On the contrary,

325
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,580
he's worried sick,

326
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,680
so he doesn't dare to check on Yuan Lu or ask about him.

327
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:18,590
He just pretends like nothing's wrong

328
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,440
and hopes when he turns around,

329
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,870
Yuan Lu is back on his feet again like last time.

330
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,440
You know them well.

331
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,350
But I don't know you very well.

332
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:32,110
Why did you risk your life for us just now?

333
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:33,740
I was just curious

334
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,920
about the feeling you talked about last night.

335
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,050
I wanted to know

336
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,470
what it felt like

337
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,390
to have someone

338
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,350
who had my back.

339
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,620
Then how do you like that feeling?

340
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,070
It's a bit troublesome.

341
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:51,850
But fighting with a partner

342
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,690
is more efficient than fighting alone.

343
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,510
You disobeyed me

344
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,040
and went rogue again.

345
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,360
It was noisy in the gorge

346
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:04,510
and my wound hurt a lot.

347
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,540
I didn't hear you.

348
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,530
Where are you hurt?

349
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,490
I hit my back on the rocks.

350
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:16,980
Isn't your arm injured too?

351
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,600
My arm is fine.

352
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,560
Mr. Ning.

353
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,210
Mr. Du.

354
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:25,800
Go ask Qian Zhao for medicine.

355
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,150
I'll check on you later.

356
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,140
Mr. Du, I was looking for you.

357
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,320
Later, when the regional inspector of Lingzhou comes,

358
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:39,960
I need you to receive him on behalf of Her Highness.

359
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:41,410
Me?

360
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,250
Yes.

361
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,300
Yuanzhou asked me to pretend to be sick

362
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,850
and wouldn't let the regional inspector meet me.

363
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,330
Is he worried that I may blow my cover?

364
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:02,110
You've never seen so many dead and injured men before.

365
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,690
He's afraid that you can't stay composed.

366
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,650
I'm so useless.

367
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,250
Will Yuan Lu

368
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,870
get it through?

369
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:16,010
God will decide that.

370
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,370
Ruyi.

371
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,430
Can you teach me how to kill?

372
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,410
I don't want anyone to get hurt

373
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,650
or die for me anymore.

374
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:42,330
Stab 300 times in a row.

375
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,920
Try not to miss the circle.

376
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,160
After you're done,

377
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,300
you'll know how to kill.

378
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:59,510
Qian, is that thing so hard to get?

379
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:00,640
I'll go search for it.

380
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:01,260
I'll go.

381
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,330
-Let me go.
-We'll figure something out.

382
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,360
We can definitely get it.

383
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:05,630
What's going on?

384
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,960
Yuan Lu's condition suddenly worsened.

385
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:08,700
He's having a high fever.

386
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:09,740
Mr. Qian said

387
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,910
we need the gallbladder of a many-banded krait to save him.

388
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,490
Ning Yuanzhou is talking with the regional inspector

389
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:14,550
in the west wing.

390
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,930
Ask him to send someone to buy it.

391
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,820
No. We need a fresh gallbladder.

392
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,560
Is one enough?

393
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:20,820
Does it have to be a many-banded krait's gallbladder?

394
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,230
What does that kind of snake look like?

395
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,960
Yeah. What does it look like?

396
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,620
Enough.

397
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,780
You don't even know what the snake looks like and where to find one.

398
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:28,470
Go ask someone working in the inn.

399
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,340
I did.

400
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,670
In Qingjing Mountain 13 miles to the west

401
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,950
and Shahe Ravine to the north,

402
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,300
people have seen that kind of snake.

403
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,550
Qingjing Mountain.

404
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,060
Lingzhou.

405
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,630
I'll go to Qingjing Mountain.

406
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,380
I'll go with you.

407
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,900
Ding Hui, let's go to Shahe Ravine.

408
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:45,330
Okay.

409
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,380
Qian, we're leaving.

410
00:32:59,020 --> 00:32:59,770
Beauty.

411
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,940
The road up the mountain is over there.

412
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,580
Why are we taking this way?

413
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:05,310
There are snakes near the creek

414
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,310
in Qingjing Mountain.

415
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:08,420
Someone told me that.

416
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,050
Really?

417
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,840
Rest assured, Mr. Du.

418
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,670
I'll immediately have a few trusted people

419
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,180
escort Zhou Jian to the capital.

420
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,660
With my teacher Prime Minister Zhang there,

421
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,470
Prince Danyang won't be able to harass the delegation again.

422
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,060
I'm relieved to hear that.

423
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,900
Thank you.

424
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,380
I'll see myself out.

425
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,950
We're still several cities away from the State of An.

426
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,710
I hope what happened today won't happen again.

427
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:50,230
No one can guarantee that.

428
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,610
Now that His Majesty is held captive,

429
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,680
many people have taken Prince Danyang's side.

430
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:56,530
We eliminated Zhou Jian's troops today

431
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,510
at great cost

432
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,130
because we had to set an example.

433
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:01,840
Those against us

434
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,250
will have to think twice

435
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,020
before coming at us.

436
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:10,540
I thought it'd only be so dangerous after we arrived in the State of An.

437
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:11,960
But unexpectedly,

438
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:14,630
blood has already been spilled before we even leave Wu.

439
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:15,639
Don't worry, Mr. Du.

440
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,440
The Liudao Hall

441
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,239
will keep Her Highness safe.

442
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,179
Thank you.

443
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,260
Blood!

444
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:35,290
-Mr. Ning, you're injured.
-Mr. Du, I'm fine.

445
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,239
I'll dress the wound later.

446
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:40,330
You've had a long day. Have a good rest.

447
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:41,310
I'll go check on Yuan Lu.

448
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:42,530
Don't worry.

449
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,020
Okay.

450
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,790
I just used antelope horns to get his temp down a little.

451
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,780
But if we can't get the gallbladder,

452
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,540
he won't make it through the night.

453
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,720
Have you sent people out to search for it?

454
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,190
Everyone who can help is out.

455
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,630
Hope they don't come back empty-handed.

456
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:10,790
By the way,

457
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:12,750
how is Miss Ren's injury?

458
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:16,570
She's injured?

459
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,410
Where is she?

460
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:26,000
She went to Qingjing Mountain with Shisan.

461
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,090
I can take care of things here.

462
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:34,790
In front of me,

463
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,870
you can be yourself.

464
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,260
Snake tracks.

465
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:01,540
There it is.

466
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,000
It's a sharp-nosed viper.

467
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,840
The sharp-nosed viper is venomous too.

468
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:15,300
Maybe its gallbladder will work as well.

469
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,740
You're amazing.

470
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,290
You knew we'd find a venomous snake here.

471
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,190
Here, put it in.

472
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:29,130
There won't be another kind of venomous snake within 150 meters.

473
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,000
Let's go somewhere else.

474
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:34,080
Let's go.

475
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,000
Darn it. It's almost dawn.

476
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:07,650
Snakes don't come out during the day.

477
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,300
If we go back too late,

478
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:10,150
I'm afraid Yuan Lu…

479
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,690
How about we catch some mice

480
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,400
and cut them without killing them?

481
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,970
The smell of blood may draw snakes over.

482
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:17,850
Okay.

483
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:52,480
Get it.

484
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,150
Watch out!

485
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,450
-Are you all right?
-Are you all right?

486
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,040
I'm right as rain!

487
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,950
The snake is all right too.

488
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,760
Very alive.

489
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,340
You've torn your wound open.

490
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,140
Your arm is dislocated again.

491
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:58,700
I'm fine.

492
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:02,280
Ning.

493
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,980
Our horses ran away.

494
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,620
I need to send the snake back immediately,

495
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,030
so I have to borrow your horse.

496
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:09,700
You can come back with Beauty after she tends to your wound.

497
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,530
Take your time.

498
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,320
Stay here as long as you need.

499
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,190
No hurry.

500
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:15,670
Yu Shisan!

501
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,630
It's gonna hurt.

502
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,440
Do you even know how to…

503
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,090
See if you can move your arm.

504
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,560
Yes.

505
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,300
Check the wound on my back for me.

506
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,940
Check the wound.

507
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,020
Breathe in.

508
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:55,350
Does it hurt?

509
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,240
Yes.

510
00:40:58,790 --> 00:40:59,850
Breathe in again.

511
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,050
Does it hurt here?

512
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:05,300
No.

513
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,320
Pull your clothes up.

514
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,120
You didn't get badly hurt during the day.

515
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,340
It's the old wounds that are hurting.

516
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:17,800
I'll dress them for you after we go back.

517
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,310
No need.

518
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,200
It's inconvenient.

519
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,100
What's wrong with you?

520
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:30,700
Nothing.

521
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,750
Are you shy?

522
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,980
If I'd known this worked for you,

523
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,140
I should've showered in front of you

524
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:47,140
like the guards did.

525
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,300
Don't do that in front of other men.

526
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:54,320
You're a girl after all.

527
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,550
For assassins, there are no men and women,

528
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,220
just the dead and the alive.

529
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:00,850
It's almost dawn.

530
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:01,960
Let's go.

531
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,590
How did you know there were snakes in Qingjing Mountain?

532
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,700
When Empress Zhaojie taught me to read,

533
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,240
she used a book called The Life in Qingjing Mountain.

534
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,770
I read in it

535
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,330
that there were venomous snakes in this mountain.

536
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,440
I just didn't realize this place was the Lingzhou

537
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:24,900
mentioned in the book.

538
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:26,820
Empress Zhaojie was really nice to you.

539
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:28,180
She was.

540
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,310
She not only taught me to read

541
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:32,150
but also bought me a house.

542
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,780
She said although I was often away from the capital,

543
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,560
as a girl,

544
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:39,350
I still needed to have a house of my own.

545
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:41,530
What's wrong?

546
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,920
Ten-Day Qianji?

547
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:46,730
Haven't you got the antidote?

548
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,690
It's the first seizure triggered by the poison.

549
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,570
I can use my internal force to suppress it.

550
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:21,530
You've only regained half of your internal force.

551
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:22,120
Shut up.

552
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,640
♫I don't know how to put it♫

553
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,420
♫Every time I turn around♫

554
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:03,450
♫I expect to see you there♫

555
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:08,510
♫I've had too much to drink♫

556
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:11,890
♫But I can't drink away my woes♫

557
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:18,810
♫I'm hopelessly in love♫

558
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:23,090
♫Drunk, I saw your eyes; dreaming, I had you in my arms♫

559
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:26,760
♫Waking up sober, I only miss you more♫

560
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,350
♫You're God's gift to me♫

561
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:34,350
♫Your smile breaks up the dark like the light of dawn♫

562
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:38,270
♫You light up my world like a shooting star♫

563
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:42,320
♫You came a long way and still have a long way to go♫

564
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,890
♫No one knows your name♫

565
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:49,750
♫But everything you shed light on♫

566
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,590
♫Will remember your radiance♫

567
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:12,570
♫I always wear a frown♫

568
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:17,000
♫Only you know why♫

569
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:15,440
The sun is up.

570
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:21,960
♫I once gave up hope♫

571
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:23,640
A grassy meadow

572
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:26,710
♫You left me with a broken heart♫

573
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,580
with pot marigolds here and there.

574
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:27,730
Such wonderful views extend for miles.

575
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:30,160
♫I should forget about you but I can't♫

576
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:30,310
Ning Yuanzhou.

577
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:35,900
♫How can I let go?♫

578
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:31,940
Do you see that?

579
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,140
What Empress Zhaojie said was true.

580
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:41,300
♫Drowning my sorrows is like cutting running water with a knife♫

581
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:45,070
♫It feels like I can never reach the end of the tunnel♫

582
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:47,810
♫When the ship sails♫

583
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:52,520
♫As long as I'm with you, I don't care how far the destination is♫

584
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:56,450
♫You're my conscience♫

585
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:01,170
♫Someone from the past who made me blue♫

586
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:06,010
♫You're the wine I can never get enough of♫

587
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:09,920
♫An indispensable part of my life♫

588
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:08,490
Here.

589
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:15,940
♫My one and only♫

590
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:32,230
Are you really all right now?

591
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,280
Yes.

592
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,670
Zhang Song's men have known I'm here.

593
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:38,260
The antidote will be delivered to me tonight.

594
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:39,220
Good.

595
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:43,840
You…

596
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:44,380
Don't move.

597
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:56,630
This was in your hair.

598
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:01,810
Don't be so guarded.

599
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,770
I just find you adorable

600
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:04,790
and want to be nice to you.

601
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:06,300
Besides,

602
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:08,380
I gave you my word yesterday in Tianxing Gorge.

603
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:10,990
You helped me kill Zhou Jian,

604
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,950
so I won't force you to have a baby with me anymore.

605
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:14,740
I'll keep my word.

606
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,240
Why did you suddenly…

607
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,360
I can lead a horse to water but can't make it drink.

608
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:21,880
You're right.

609
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:23,960
There are many good men out there.

610
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,250
You're not my only option.

611
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,640
How is Yuan Lu?

612
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:32,930
He's awake.

613
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:34,010
He made it through.

614
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:34,980
I'll go check on him.

615
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:53,210
What?

616
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:55,210
I heard your voice and hurried out.

617
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:58,000
I didn't expect to see something even more exciting

618
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:00,250
than what Yu told me.

619
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:04,420
Cousin wouldn't leave you alone

620
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:06,260
but suddenly walked away from you.

621
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,290
You must feel upset.

622
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:22,880
Ruyi.

623
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:23,860
Don't get up.

624
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:27,660
Thank you.

625
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,400
You and Shisan caught the snake and saved me.

626
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:33,830
You lent me your crossbow. I just returned your favor.

627
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:36,400
Have a good rest.

628
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,280
This is for you.
