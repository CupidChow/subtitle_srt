[A Journey To Love]

[Episode 18]

4
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:01,890
Who's there?

5
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,210
Me.

6
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:06,930
Her Highness?

7
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:14,770
Coming.

8
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:20,690
Your Highness.

9
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,290
I'm sorry.

10
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,610
Are you okay? Come on.

11
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:26,530
Let me help you up.

12
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,120
My back...

13
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:33,930
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,329
I wanted to apologize to you,

15
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,880
but I made you fall again.

16
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,530
Every debt has its debtor.

17
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,290
It's Zheng Qingyun who hurt me,

18
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,570
not you.

19
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,090
Besides,

20
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,210
as a girl,

21
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,250
what's your intention for

22
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,960
coming to the room of a young and vital man

23
00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:56,610
secretly in the middle of the night?

24
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,300
Wait, don't...

25
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,250
Don't cry.

26
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:04,450
I...

27
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,490
I just wanted to make a joke like Shisan

28
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,930
so that you wouldn't feel too guilty.

29
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:09,970
I...

30
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,650
I guess I screwed it up again.

31
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:13,970
No.

32
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:16,940
I'm sad because

33
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,329
I haven't been called a girl for a long time.

34
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,810
I'm going to die in the State of An this time.

35
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,240
In the entire world, other than you,

36
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:25,970
Ruyi,

37
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,340
and Yuanzhou,

38
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,400
I'm afraid not many people know

39
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,329
that I'm actually a princess.

40
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,000
N-Not necessarily.

41
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,570
Many coroners will come after you die.

42
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,329
By then, these secrets won't be kept under wraps.

43
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,490
S-So...

44
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,670
So you must die beautifully.

45
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,040
Otherwise,

46
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,810
it'll be embarrassing

47
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,090
when people talk about it.

48
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,580
When I took things too hard just now,

49
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,410
Ruyi told me the same thing.

50
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,130
Right?

51
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:13,650
I've made up my mind.

52
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,680
When I die,

53
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,649
I must be like a great hero

54
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:19,250
who's

55
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,210
a skilled diplomat gazing down upon the mighty men.

56
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,740
I want everyone to know

57
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,730
how valiant my sacrifice is

58
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:28,700
and how...

59
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,070
Watch what you say!

60
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,850
Look at you. Does it hurt again?

61
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,330
You finally got better.

62
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,970
Why are you cursing yourself again?

63
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,570
It's not a curse.

64
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,730
Since I was young, I knew

65
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,610
that I can't live beyond 20 years old because of my heart disease.

66
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:46,850
Really.

67
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:49,530
Although

68
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,270
I can't determine how I was born,

69
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,170
I have to figure out how I die.

70
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,690
I can't just wait to die in fear

71
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,720
because I'm destined to die early.

72
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:01,730
Right?

73
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:03,890
But you...

74
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,570
Boss sure knows me well.

75
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,380
I followed him out this time

76
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,020
and he didn't say a word.

77
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,740
One's life

78
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,390
should be a grand and spectacular experience.

79
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,940
Just like you.

80
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,410
If you just live a life

81
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,450
married to some guy,

82
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,780
your life will be over without anything to your name.

83
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,550
No one will remember you in a few years.

84
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,730
But now,

85
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,250
when you go to the State of An and see the emperor,

86
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,370
even if you die,

87
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,650
the National History Museum will give you a self-cultivation certificate

88
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,130
and a biography.

89
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,000
You dressing up as a man,

90
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:43,810
being heroic and extraordinary, and whatnot.

91
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,320
At least four lines of commendation.

92
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,050
Really?

93
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:46,690
Really.

94
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,450
Sister-in-law told me about history in the past.

95
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,430
She said that the greatest honor

96
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,750
of emperors, generals, and ministers

97
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,810
is to have a good reputation in history books.

98
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:54,690
See?

99
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,170
Why would I lie to you?

100
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,610
So you need to recover soon

101
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,330
and behave well in front of the officials

102
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,450
in the State of An.

103
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,250
Show them your attitude as a country's prince.

104
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,410
Let them take a good look at you.

105
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,090
You mustn't weep and whine anymore.

106
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:14,890
By the way,

107
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,580
I almost forgot.

108
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,400
You were taking things too hard just now...

109
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,040
Don't tell me it's because of that jerk, Zheng Qingyun?

110
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,330
No way.

111
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,250
It...

112
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,010
It...

113
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,420
It's because I got everyone hurt again

114
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,130
so I felt guilty and took it too hard.

115
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:38,130
It's not because of

116
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,409
that jerk, Zheng Qingyun.

117
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,810
That jerk means nothing to me.

118
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,610
Yes.

119
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:45,650
Just wait.

120
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:46,770
At dawn,

121
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,530
I'd calmly

122
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,010
go and see Marquis Changqing.

123
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,010
Good.

124
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:52,630
Well said.

125
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,470
This is how my Prince Li of Wu is like.

126
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:57,750
Prince Li.

127
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,090
Then, Yuan Lu,

128
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,610
give me an idea.

129
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,660
If anything happens to me in the State of An,

130
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,410
how should I die

131
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,570
to have a good reputation in history books?

132
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,300
I want to wear a flower hairpin dress.

133
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,530
This is the princess's most formal dress.

134
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,650
I only saw my sister wear it during her marriage.

135
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:24,890
Die by poison.

136
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,600
I'll ask Qian to make you a good poison.

137
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,330
You'll just have to drink it.

138
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,250
I promise

139
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,420
your face won't turn blue even when you're dead.

140
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,280
Really?

141
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:34,850
Yes.

142
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,200
Qian is that skillful?

143
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,330
Then...

144
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:38,450
Then...

145
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,220
Then, can you ask him to make it taste better?

146
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,409
Preferably sweet.

147
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:45,860
That's...

148
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,610
That's a little hard.

149
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,760
No. No matter how hard it is, he has to do it.

150
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,320
I'll order him tomorrow.

151
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,010
This is what I'll tell him.

152
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,010
Qian, listen carefully.

153
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,870
I want you to make me

154
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,170
the tastiest poison in the world.

155
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,130
Sour plum flavor would be the best.

156
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,370
How about a sweet flavor instead?

157
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,450
The sweet and sour flavor is good.

158
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,530
I think a sweet flavor is better.

159
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,660
Sweet and sour tastes the best.

160
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:13,890
It really can't be done.

161
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:14,770
It can.

162
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,360
Sweet and sour.

163
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,610
Sweet and sour. Sweet and sour. Sweet and sour.

164
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,290
Fine, sweet and sour it is.

165
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,090
I'm the one drinking it, not you.

166
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:22,770
Right.

167
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:42,320
♫My palm line branched because of you♫

168
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:49,220
♫My hands hurt when spring comes♫

169
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,210
♫I don't know how to put it♫

170
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:59,650
♫Every time I turn around♫

171
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,270
♫I expect to see you there♫

172
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,040
♫I've had too much to drink♫

173
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,270
♫But I can't drink away my woes♫

174
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:19,360
♫I'm hopelessly in love♫

175
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:23,440
♫Drunk, I saw your eyes; dreaming, I had you in my arms♫

176
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,190
♫Waking up sober, I only miss you more♫

177
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,020
♫You're God's gift to me♫

178
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:34,880
♫Your smile breaks up the dark like the light of dawn♫

179
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,180
It's dawn.

180
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,700
♫You light up my world like a shooting star♫

181
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,550
♫You came a long way and still have a long way to go♫

182
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,410
It's so beautiful.

00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,510
♫No one knows your name♫

184
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,100
♫An indispensable part of my life♫

185
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,890
I was up there the whole time last night.

186
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,250
I heard everything

187
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,300
Cousin told Yuan Lu

188
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,850
and Her Highness,

189
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,760
and what Yuan Lu told Her Highness.

190
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,800
Do you want to know?

191
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:12,210
No.

192
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,470
You didn't sleep at all last night, right?

193
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,460
You got angry out of jealousy again, right?

194
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,860
She thinks she did nothing wrong,

195
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,610
so she got angry again, right?

196
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,210
Since you look like you're in such a bad mood

197
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,450
that you're on the verge of killing someone,

198
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,450
I, the omniscient Yu Shisan,

199
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,400
am willing to work for you, Boss Ning.

200
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,570
I don’t need your help. I can handle it myself.

201
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,160
Don't be stubborn.

202
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,510
It promotes hair loss.

203
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,370
Boss Ning, good morning.

204
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:53,650
How is it a good morning?

205
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,010
Wait, I...

206
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:02,770
Boss Ning.

207
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:05,820
Have a seat.

208
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,350
I discussed with Mr. Du yesterday.

209
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,770
We still have a chance

210
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,080
with Marquis Changqing.

211
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,970
A soft approach and a hard one.

212
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:24,930
The hard approach

213
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,800
is to tell them the bandits sent by Prince Danyang

214
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,210
are from the State of An.

215
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,880
Then we provoke them

216
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,500
by saying that they're up to no good

217
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,990
and don't care about negotiating sincerely.

218
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,650
The soft approach

219
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,740
is to tell them that the bandits' masterminds

220
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,050
are the two princes who don’t get along with Marquis Changqing,

221
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,610
and that they're trying

222
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,260
to frame Marquis Changqing with it.

223
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,510
Then we'll hint to Marquis Changqing

224
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,490
that as long as he helps us

225
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,850
complete the mission,

226
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,250
we'll definitely

227
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:59,490
return the favor.

228
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:00,910
See?

229
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,200
When Ning mentioned Marquis Changqing,

230
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,100
his facial expression changed.

231
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,130
He can't wait to tear him into pieces.

232
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,250
If nobody has any objections,

233
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,880
I'll use these approaches

234
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,410
to negotiate with Marquis Changqing.

235
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:21,490
Wait.

236
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:23,730
Your Highness.

237
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,860
I think rather than you,

238
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:32,370
Miss Ruyi is more suitable for negotiating with Marquis Changqing.

239
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:33,440
Mr. Du.

240
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,010
Mr. Ning.

241
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,650
As you all saw yesterday,

242
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,810
Marquis Changqing seems to

243
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,210
regard Miss Ruyi differently.

244
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:44,760
Mr. Du.

245
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,580
I've told you many times

246
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,890
that Miss Ruyi has nothing to do with this.

247
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:50,530
Mr. Ning.

248
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,090
Please forgive me for taking the liberty.

249
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,130
Miss Ruyi.

250
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,690
Whether you can persuade Marquis Changqing

251
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:01,110
is related to the success of this delegation.

252
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,150
I hope you can take on this task.

253
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,530
Mr. Du, I’m afraid you forgot

254
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,400
that I'm not from Liudao Hall.

255
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,890
This delegation's success

256
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,450
has nothing to do with me.

257
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,330
But Miss Ruyi,

258
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,490
aren't you Mr. Ning's subordinate?

259
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,330
Ning Yuanzhou.

260
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,010
Am I someone who's subservient to you?

261
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:36,690
Of course not.

262
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,090
Mr. Du.

263
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,880
I invited Miss Ruyi here

264
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,250
as His Highness' preceptor.

265
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,890
We shouldn't let her interfere in the delegation's matters.

266
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,110
Mr. Ning, this is an important matter.

267
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,610
Can't you make a sacrifice?

268
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:51,650
-Mr. Du.
-This is strange.

269
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:52,120
You…

270
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,640
You want a favor from me.

271
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,500
Then why are you asking Ning Yuanzhou?

272
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,720
Also, even if I'm willing to help,

273
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:59,930
I'm doing it as Princess Huyang.

274
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,030
Is this how you talk to the royal family's princess?

275
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,320
Your Highness, I formally request for your help to relieve the worries of Wu.

276
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:12,980
Mr. Du.

277
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:14,280
Mr. Ning.

278
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,380
You want me to leave the delegation,

279
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,730
but Mr. Du wants me to stay.

280
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,810
This is a dilemma.

281
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,210
I made a mistake by asking you to leave the delegation

282
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,050
before.

283
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,010
But please think twice

284
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,770
about this matter concerning Marquis Changqing.

285
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,120
Mr. Ning.

286
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:58,850
Boss.

287
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:00,690
Boss.

288
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,130
Your Highness. Mr. Du.

289
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,140
Marquis Changqing is here again.

290
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,230
He even brought a gift.

291
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,590
He said he regretted disturbing His Highness yesterday,

292
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,770
so he specially came to visit today.

293
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:15,890
Miss Ruyi.

294
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:19,970
Mr. Ning.

295
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,180
Tell him His Highness is still recovering.

296
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,170
I'll see him today.

297
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,170
I need to change my clothes.

298
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:39,530
Ruyi.

299
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,010
Yu Shisan.

300
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,010
Beauty, I'm coming.

301
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:45,890
Don't worry, Beauty.

302
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Today, I'll do everything I can

303
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,920
to make you unparalleled in style.

304
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:03,570
Yuan Lu, come here.

305
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,619
Sun Lang.

306
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:12,290
Send more people to follow her.

307
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:14,010
You'd better ask around on the side too.

308
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,329
Yes.

309
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:27,569
Yuan Lu.

310
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,370
Send His Highness back to rest.

311
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,370
Yes.

312
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,050
Your Highness, please.

313
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,140
How dare you ask Cousin to leave the delegation

314
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,490
because of your jealousy?

315
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,030
No wonder she's giving you a hard time.

316
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,970
But when you were bowing just now,

317
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,490
she obviously felt sorry for you.

318
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,320
Why don't you seize the chance?

319
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,500
You're Qian Zhao,

320
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,140
not Yu Shisan.

321
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,690
If you're determined to preserve your dignity,

322
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,290
then I'll just be a bystander.

323
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,370
I know her thoughts and concerns.

324
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,690
But I have my standpoint too.

325
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,330
I was too anxious about this indeed.

326
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:29,650
But did you see

327
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,240
how she provoked me in front of everyone just now?

328
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,810
I used to think

329
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,870
you're a magnanimous person.

330
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,130
But I realized I was wrong today.

331
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,250
Do you know why Sun Lang, Ding Hui, and I

332
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,290
are all alone?

333
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:50,890
Why?

334
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,890
Because we can't even find someone

335
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:54,730
who'd provoke us.

336
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,080
Yu Shisan is ready to make a move.

337
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,610
If you don't make up with Cousin,

338
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,050
I won't be able to stop him.

339
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,610
One's a loyal marquis,

340
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,970
and the other's a gentle and romantic playboy.

341
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,420
Everyone is better than you.

342
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,610
Do you think I won't beat you up?

343
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,570
I know you can't do it.

344
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,850
And I have to pick up Li Tongguang now.

345
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:56,330
He sure is Ruyi's disciple.

346
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,550
Their gazes are exactly the same.

347
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,720
Boss.

348
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,780
Do you think Marquis Changqing

349
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,250
knows that you and Ruyi are...

350
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:04,690
Wait, I have a question.

351
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,460
You guys can't talk without associating the two of them together,

352
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,690
can you?

353
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:12,550
How are they alike?

354
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:13,190
Tell me.

355
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,220
How are their gazes similar?

356
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,340
Boss, I...

357
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,570
Can I ask another question?

358
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,090
Go on.

359
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,090
Do you really want Ruyi to leave the delegation?

360
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,040
But besides you,

361
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,960
Ruyi's the most important person in the delegation.

362
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,600
Everyone's worried

363
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,100
that you two fought today.

364
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:47,250
Even Chief Clerk Du asked His Highness about you two.

365
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,130
It's not as simple as you think.

366
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,760
Besides, even if Ruyi leaves,

367
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,360
I'm still here.

368
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,700
You're right.

369
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:58,570
But, Boss Ning,

370
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,950
although Ruyi, His Highness and Chief Clerk Du

371
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,310
are not from the Liudao Hall,

372
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,330
if we want to save His Majesty,

373
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:05,890
everyone in our delegation

374
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,900
needs one.

375
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,550
Everyone's the backbone of the delegation.

376
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:09,490
Of course,

377
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,570
you'll always be our boss.

378
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,180
You know I’m weak,

379
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,880
but you never stopped me from fighting with you.

380
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,650
But why do you want Ruyi to leave the delegation

381
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,080
just because of Marquis Changqing?

382
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:26,930
Although Marquis Changqing

383
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,970
is younger than you,

384
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,450
has known Ruyi longer than you,

385
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,400
and is a little handsome,

386
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,730
there seems to be nothing else special about him.

387
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,370
If I were Ruyi,

388
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:42,020
I would feel wronged too.

389
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:45,890
Liar.

390
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,930
You said you liked me and believed me.

391
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,410
They're all lies.

392
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,970
You didn't take your medicine today, did you?

393
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,620
Do you think I'm that petty?

394
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:58,890
How could I be bothered

395
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,010
by that mere Marquis Changqing?

396
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,030
Ruyi said that,

397
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,250
not me.

398
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,090
I heard that Prince Li is getting better.

399
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,570
I wonder when I can see him.

400
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,010
Thank you for asking, Marquis.

401
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:21,370
His Highness has lived a pampered life since he was young.

402
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,120
Since he entered Xucheng,

403
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,000
he's been repeatedly frightened by your country's army.

404
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:26,970
I'm afraid...

405
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,200
it'll take him a while to recover.

406
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:31,810
Really?

407
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:34,990
It seems that your country's Liudao Hall is mediocre.

408
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,770
Chief Ning is his personal bodyguard

409
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,970
but Prince Li still got frightened.

410
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,090
No wonder your emperor was...

411
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,760
Marquis.

412
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,010
Please mind your words.

413
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,090
Fine.

414
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,570
Then, let's get down to business.

415
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,460
My country's emperor is not continuing his southern expedition

416
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,310
so that I can deliver a message.

417
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,410
He hopes Prince Li can arrive in An Capital within seven days.

418
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,810
Within seven days?

419
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,250
How is that possible?

420
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:02,130
His Highness' health...

421
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,810
If he deliberately delays it,

422
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:06,290
I'm afraid he won't be able to see His Majesty.

423
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,050
By then,

424
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,610
he'll be inconvenienced to stay in An Capital

425
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,900
with your country's leader for a few more days.

426
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:13,710
Marquis.

427
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,420
-You're forcing...
-Since we can’t see him,

428
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,380
we might as well ask Prince Li not to go.

429
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:39,890
Princess.

430
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,680
Mr. Du, you may leave.

431
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:44,830
There are some things you don’t need to explain.

432
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,770
I've always been a misfit in the royal family.

433
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:50,610
Let me say the harsh words.

434
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:52,370
Yes.

435
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:54,910
Master.

436
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,210
Master.

437
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,650
Why have you changed?

438
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,750
How? Of course she's different.

439
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,730
Lower your voice.

440
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,630
I used the State of Nan's brown powder

441
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,810
to contour her face and eyes.

442
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,500
I also added rouge and enhanced her lip color.

443
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:23,680
Finally, I drew a tiny mole at the corner of her eye with soot ink.

444
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,730
She looks like an old friend from afar,

445
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,560
but up close, she definitely looks like a different person.

446
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:32,690
Wait.

447
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:36,230
Why do you carry rouge with you?

448
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:39,410
Why does a swordsman carry their sword with them?

449
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,370
Next time when you see Chief Jin,

450
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,090
remember to put on your own makeup nicely.

451
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,730
It doesn’t matter whether he puts on makeup or not.

452
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:49,080
Chief Jin has long fallen for Boss Ning

453
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,220
and forgotten about Shisan.

454
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,850
The problem now is

455
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,390
that since Chief Jin has Ruyi,

456
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,620
she doesn't even want Boss Ning.

457
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,370
Why are you looking at me? Get down to business.

458
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,370
Marquis Changqing, you're being imprudent again.

459
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:10,610
Master.

460
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,810
I chased away all the Scarlet Guards in He County.

461
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,130
There's no one else in this room.

462
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,940
We can acknowledge each other now.

463
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,810
Marquis Changqing, let me say it again.

464
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:19,980
I'm not your master.

465
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,650
Don't be so cruel.

466
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:25,970
I miss you so much.

467
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,370
Don't you remember the past?

468
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,000
When we were in the martial arts arena...

469
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:30,850
Fine.

470
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,680
If you insist that I'm your master,

471
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,610
it's not impossible.

472
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,810
But please sit down

473
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,190
and let me finish first.

474
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:55,190
Go ahead.

475
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,080
What I said just now

476
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,890
about not letting Prince Li enter An Capital

477
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,090
was just out of spite.

478
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,000
We both know that

479
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:09,760
your country's leader is trying to assert his authority

480
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:12,270
by ordering for the delegation to arrive in An Capital within seven days.

481
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:16,610
But most of the officials in Wu

482
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,620
are against Prince Li entering the State of An.

483
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,640
Prince Danyang who's currently supervising the state

484
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,720
is also interested in taking over the country.

485
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,680
I'm afraid

486
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:29,190
he's the one who's most eager for the negotiation to fail.

487
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,810
But what does this have to do with me?

488
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,260
You know the answer.

489
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,210
As far as I know,

490
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,350
although you've been valued by your emperor for the past few years,

491
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,860
Prince Hedong and Prince Luoxi dislike you.

492
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,140
No matter who ascends the throne,

493
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,690
I'm afraid you'll be on pins and needles.

494
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,610
Among the two princes,

495
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,620
I wonder who you're more keen on cozying up to?

496
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,700
We're willing to help you push the blame of this banditry

497
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,360
to the other prince you don't like.

498
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:13,930
In this way,

499
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,100
you can use this

500
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,730
as your stepping stone in the future.

501
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,530
You're so thoughtful.

502
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,950
But I don't care for

503
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,890
such a small favor.

504
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,050
Then how about I add

505
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,950
the two cities of Yuncheng and Miancheng into the deal?

506
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:47,370
As far as I know,

507
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,570
you don't have a real title yet.

508
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,760
If you're willing to help Prince Li

509
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,370
and bring His Majesty back safely,

510
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,890
Wu would like to use these two cities

511
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,570
to wish you well in your journey to become the highest-ranking minister in the future.

512
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,050
Highest-ranking minister?

513
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,730
You think too highly of me.

514
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:11,410
I'm just an illegitimate...

515
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,680
I'm just a reckless general.

516
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,810
I have no such lofty ambition.

517
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:30,530
But weren't the rulers of the two states of An and Wu

518
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,970
also previously mere generals?

519
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,370
If I agree,

520
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,530
can you promise me one thing?

521
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,280
Please be frank.

522
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:53,970
Please return to your seat.

523
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:04,570
And then?

524
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,410
Don't talk.

525
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:09,950
Close your eyes.

526
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:37,210
Master, you're so nice.

527
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,720
Then don't run around carelessly again.

528
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,470
Got it?

529
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:44,830
Master.

530
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,090
I really regret

531
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,820
bickering with you that day.

532
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:57,210
I knew you went to Princess Xunyang's Mansion to see me

533
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,710
♫The east wind is the cruelest♫

534
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,330
but I hid in the street corner and didn’t come out.

535
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:03,850
♫It brings rain that reminds me of the day you left♫

536
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:08,240
♫The day when you left everything we had shattered on the ground♫

537
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:05,890
Master.

538
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:11,240
♫I end up alone again♫

539
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,450
The fire in the imperial prison is so strong.

540
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,710
♫If fate is on my side♫

541
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,850
Does it hurt?

542
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:21,150
♫I'll meet you again♫

543
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:20,850
Master.

544
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:28,950
♫Could that deja vu be a sign?♫

545
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,920
I really miss you.

546
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,170
I miss you so much that my heart is about to shatter.

547
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:35,150
♫I don't know how many miles I have to go to find you♫

548
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,730
Every time I jumped into

549
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,390
the cold spring you took me to,

550
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:43,630
♫I search for your eyes but can only see your back♫

551
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,590
I wanted to die in there.

552
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,790
Because in that way,

553
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:53,830
♫I can't tell if this is just a dream♫

554
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,610
I can see you sooner.

555
00:30:54,370 --> 00:31:02,310
♫I don't want to wake up; I can't stop missing you♫

556
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:09,700
♫You're the one person I can never get over♫

557
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,410
Don't cry.

558
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,290
Or I'll hit you.

559
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:19,220
♫You're the wrong person but this love feels so right♫

560
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,670
Master

561
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,880
Master.

562
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:19,700
Master.

563
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:27,130
♫I'll spend the rest of my life♫

564
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,160
Don't abandon me.

565
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:36,230
♫On the fool's errand of forgetting you♫

566
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:42,290
♫Because of you, my years became important and then not♫

567
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,480
This is nice.

568
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:46,560
♫My world begins and ends with you♫

569
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,030
Even if I die,

570
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:50,550
♫There's love in all weathers♫

571
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,130
this lifetime is worth it.

572
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:54,140
♫The vast expanse of the world is in your palms♫

573
00:31:54,340 --> 00:32:02,000
♫If you're the treasure of my dreams♫

574
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:10,310
♫I want to hold on to you but it's too late♫

575
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:18,970
♫It's too late, so I have to cling to these memories♫

576
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,980
What is he talking about?

577
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:27,030
♫Forgetting you is a fool's errand♫

578
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:23,940
It’s worth it to die?

579
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,890
Marquis Changqing’s words are really heartbreaking

580
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,090
and heartfelt.

581
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,490
If I were Beauty,

582
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,550
I'd have acknowledged him long ago.

583
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,640
Is he really just Ruyi's disciple?

584
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,940
He treats Cousin better than how Boss Ning treats her.

585
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,370
Don't, don't... Calm down.

586
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,040
Princess.

587
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,540
His Highness just woke up.

588
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:02,500
He wants to see you urgently.

589
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,640
Got it.

590
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:09,190
Marquis.

591
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:11,640
We'll leave now.

592
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:15,230
We?

593
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:20,210
Princess and I will accompany Prince Li to the State of An.

594
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,370
Of course it's "we".

595
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:30,410
Marquis, since I've fulfilled your wish,

596
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,210
I hope you can keep your promise

597
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,170
and think it through.

598
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,010
Okay.

599
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:52,270
Marquis.

600
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:55,810
She's not my master.

601
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,710
At first, she seemed pretty similar to Master.

602
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:02,210
But when I looked closely,

603
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,750
she's just a fake.

604
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,460
Master only cared about

605
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,810
martial arts and Her Majesty.

606
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,310
She didn't have the time to care about the court.

607
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:13,650
It's even more unlikely that Master would be like this Princess,

608
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,400
who's so haughty

609
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:18,179
about such a clumsy scheme.

610
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,620
She and Master

611
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:23,170
are worlds apart.

612
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:26,770
You're perceptive indeed.

613
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,929
There are too many people who look similar in this world.

614
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:31,190
Then,

615
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,770
why don't we stay away from this princess

616
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,770
to save you from trouble?

617
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:36,350
No.

618
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:37,969
I want her.

619
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,650
As long as she can be by my side

620
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,370
like just now,

621
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:46,210
I still can feel Master's presence.

622
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,730
I haven't experienced such joy

623
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:52,690
in a long time.

624
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,300
So,

625
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,820
whether she's a fake or not,

626
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,870
I must get her no matter what

627
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,970
and never let her leave.

628
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:41,660
Ruyi.

629
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,270
-You were just...
-If I leave, you...

630
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:48,690
You heard everything outside.

631
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,530
What else can I say?

632
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,690
What are you suspecting now?

633
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,130
Nothing.

634
00:35:58,610 --> 00:35:59,410
I admit

635
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,610
I'm a little jealous

636
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,750
and envious

637
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:04,170
of the time you spent together.

638
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,540
But I didn't go in there because I was jealous

639
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:07,490
or envious.

640
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,480
His manner of speech was off

641
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,530
and I was afraid that the intimate behavior would make him deluded

642
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:12,610
and cause more trouble.

643
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,650
So I couldn't help it...

644
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,250
Then, do you...

645
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:24,770
still want to kick me out?

646
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:28,970
Ruyi.

647
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:32,340
It's my fault for asking you to leave the delegation.

648
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:34,690
You're the person I want to protect

649
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,810
throughout this lifetime.

650
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,180
I also understood

651
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:40,680
what Yuan Lu said just now.

652
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,440
He said

653
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:45,290
although he has heart disease since he was little,

654
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,400
I never stopped him

655
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,340
from doing anything.

656
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,450
But when it's about you,

657
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,120
I'm always imposing my will on you

658
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,410
and never considered your feelings.

659
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:58,450
I'm sorry.

660
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:04,690
Thank you for telling me all this.

661
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:07,740
I think I know what you're thinking.

662
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:12,970
But there's one thing

663
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:16,250
we might need to talk about.

664
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:24,980
Actually, I've been

665
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,410
very confused these days.

666
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,930
Do you remember what you said

667
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:31,900
in the yard that day?

668
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:35,810
You said that when this mission is completed,

669
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:38,450
you want to take me to an isolated island to live in seclusion,

670
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:41,730
gazing at each other, looking at spring flowers and listening to birds.

671
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,320
You said I'd like that kind of life.

672
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:45,810
Actually,

673
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,250
I wanted to say something then.

674
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,920
But you looked so happy and confident,

675
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:54,890
so I didn't say anything.

676
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:56,690
So,

677
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,610
you don't like that kind of life at all.

678
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:17,970
I used to think

679
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,020
I was used to being alone,

680
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,120
keeping a proper distance from others,

681
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,230
and just observing everything around me.

682
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,410
But along the way, I realized

683
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,300
that the myriad of colors and hustle and bustle

684
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,470
of the ordinary streets and alleys

685
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:37,970
are actually really beautiful.

686
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,690
It's so beautiful that I question

687
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:43,040
if I had really lived before.

688
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:47,810
I like the feeling of fighting enemies together

689
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:49,890
and having someone backing me up.

690
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:53,610
I like having friends to mess around with in the delegation.

691
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,770
I like to encounter new people and things

692
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:57,730
whenever I go somewhere new.

693
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,210
Yuanzhou.

694
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,290
In fact, you're the one

695
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,250
who let me have this experience.

696
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:12,220
So this is how you feel.

697
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,250
I actually had no clue.

698
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,090
I thought

699
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,290
you were heartbroken because of

700
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:23,160
the State of An and the Scarlet Guards,

701
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,890
tired of the constant scheming

702
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,650
and the cold-blooded calculations,

703
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,330
and hated the bloody killing.

704
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,610
Also, I remember

705
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:35,650
that you told me

706
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:38,010
Empress Zhaojie hoped

707
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,300
you'd live an ordinary life.

708
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,240
I thought that was the life you wanted.

709
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,390
Yes.

710
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,240
I do hate the Scarlet Guards.

711
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:50,970
I hate troublesome situations

712
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:55,590
where women are regarded as toys and killing tools.

713
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:00,570
But I don't hate using my capabilities

714
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:03,060
to do something for my comrades who were murdered.

715
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:09,550
In the past,

716
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:12,250
I can wield my hand against tyrannical politicians from other countries

717
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:16,970
and kill the incompetent officials who plunder the wealth of the people.

718
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:18,930
In the future,

719
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,320
there may be a broader world for me to do so.

720
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,360
Maybe

721
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:26,290
it won't be that great or smooth.

722
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:28,930
But someday, I still hope

723
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,730
to be like Meiniang

724
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:32,980
and take in apprentices,

725
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,940
or do something else.

726
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:37,690
I want to use my brains and brawn

727
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,330
to do something for the suffering women

728
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,060
within the Scarlet Guards,

729
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:42,370
instead of...

730
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,530
Instead of accompanying a man

731
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,780
to live a life that he wants.

732
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:58,430
Roaming the martial world

733
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,850
or living in seclusion

734
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,400
are inherently two different paths.

735
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:07,920
So,

736
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,880
let's think about it carefully, okay?

737
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:19,110
♫The sword reflects the cold radiance of the frost in the passes and mountains♫

738
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:17,090
Okay.

739
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:25,870
♫Life and death in the martial world♫

740
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,030
Then, are you still

741
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,810
leaving the delegation?

742
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:32,380
♫For whom chivalrous men cross the river together, there is no regret♫

743
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:28,370
Don't worry.

744
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,370
I won't leave the delegation.

745
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:33,580
We're not in a relationship cold war either.

746
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:38,870
♫We were once in love♫

747
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,940
Only when both of us have thought it through

748
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:42,210
can we know if we can go on.

749
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:45,270
♫Right and wrong, happiness and sorrow♫

750
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:43,740
Right?

751
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:51,290
♫But my world is tearful now when the spring breeze blows♫

752
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,390
Right.

753
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:57,690
♫Drinking in the windy snow as the snow turns to ashes♫

754
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:03,880
♫Lamenting that separations are irrevocable♫

755
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:10,040
♫How many years has it been?♫

756
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:12,880
♫Having to sober up♫

757
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:20,780
♫After losing the one to spend the rest of my life with♫

758
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,260
Boss Ning.

759
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:23,060
Boss.

760
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:25,250
What’s wrong?

761
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:26,960
Mr. Du wants to see you.

762
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,480
Got it.

763
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:41,680
Yuan Lu.

764
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:43,250
Do you understand that?

765
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:45,610
Did they make up or not?

766
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:47,420
They must have.

767
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:48,990
Look at Ruyi's

768
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,410
calm expression.

769
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:53,130
Then why is Yuanzhou

770
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:54,690
still pulling a long face?

771
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:57,970
W-Well...

772
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:58,980
Well...

773
00:42:58,980 --> 00:42:59,730
You don't understand.

774
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:03,290
When two people fight

775
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:04,790
and separate quietly,

776
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,390
that's truly indicative of a big problem.

777
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:07,490
-What?
-What?

778
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,970
They just had a little argument.

779
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:11,780
Why did things suddenly take such a drastic turn?

780
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:13,510
To think I spent so much time persuading Boss Ning.

781
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:14,610
I told him

782
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:16,250
to be subservient to Ruyi.

783
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:18,210
But he didn't reject the idea.

784
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:20,770
It's not something that can be solved by being subservient.

785
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:22,510
Jealousy is just a trigger.

786
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:24,610
A series of problems triggered by the jealousy

787
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:25,800
is what's serious.

788
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:28,450
Beauty and Ning are people

789
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:30,040
who can't tolerate anything that deviate from their own views.

790
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:33,530
Something bad's about to happen!

791
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:35,730
What should we do?

792
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,270
We can only make a last-ditch attempt.

793
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:41,980
Let's split up and target them separately.

794
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:43,770
-Yuan Lu, go find Beauty.
-Yes.

795
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:45,990
Beauty looks cold but she's soft-hearted.

796
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:47,170
You have to pester her.

797
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:48,040
Tell her

798
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:50,530
that Boss Ning is in constant agony,

799
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:52,010
drinking a lot and in a terrible state.

800
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:53,170
That sort of thing. Get it?

801
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:53,720
Yes.

802
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:56,490
Your Highness, go to Ning.

803
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:58,130
What do women desire the most?

804
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,520
Understanding, right?

805
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:03,460
Tell him to be understanding of

806
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:04,730
Beauty's sadness.

807
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:07,960
Anyway, we can't let the gap between them

808
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:08,800
get bigger.

809
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:10,390
-Yes.
-Yes.

810
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:19,570
-Greetings, Your Highness.
-Mr. Du and Mr. Ning haven't finished talking?

811
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:21,730
Mr. Du, please stop.

812
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:23,790
Why haven't you given up on that idea?

813
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:25,100
Mr. Ning.

814
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:26,890
I know

815
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:29,240
that it's indeed a bit forceful.

816
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:30,540
Your Highness, I...

817
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:31,310
But you saw it.

818
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:33,030
-After Miss Ruyi...
-Yes.

819
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:34,410
talked to Marquis Changqing,

820
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,690
his attitude towards the delegation

821
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:37,850
changed a lot.

822
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:40,200
Mr. Ning.

823
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,210
In the future, if Miss Ruyi

824
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:45,580
can talk to Marquis Changqing more often,

825
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:48,130
maybe

826
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:51,330
we can get Marquis Changqing to directly persuade the State of An's emperor

827
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,090
to release His Majesty.

828
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,490
But Ruyi is not from Liudao Hall.

829
00:44:58,650 --> 00:44:59,410
Mr. Ning.

830
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:01,290
With all due respect,

831
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:04,360
I can see the affection

832
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:06,240
between you and Miss Ruyi.

833
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:10,010
Women should abide by the three obediences and four virtues.

834
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:11,970
Besides,

835
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,190
Miss Ruyi herself is a spy.

836
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:21,420
If you ask her to talk to Marquis Changqing,

837
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,500
I don’t think she’ll be averse to it.
