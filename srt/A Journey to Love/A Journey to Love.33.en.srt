[Next day, Liuli Fortress of the State of An]

5
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,560
Boss.

6
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:17,810
Ruyi and the others...

7
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,090
I haven't heard from them yet.

8
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,640
How are His Majesty and Mr. Du?

9
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,250
Chief Clerk Du has woken up. He's fine for now,

10
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,800
but His Majesty's injury...

11
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,010
Qian said that whether he can survive or not

12
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,690
depends on tonight.

13
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,030
Where is the name clearing edict I asked you to prepare?

14
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:44,990
Here.

15
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,260
I've tried my best to draw the flower seal.

16
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,220
Worst case scenario,

17
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,970
just say that His Majesty was badly injured and couldn't hold the brush.

18
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,670
That's why the flower seal doesn't look right.

19
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,760
We only need his fingerprint now.

20
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,660
Qian, take a rest.

21
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,200
Even if you give all your internal force to His Majesty,

22
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,610
it won't help.

23
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,250
No.

24
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:16,760
We haven't arrived yet.

25
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,870
He can't die here.

26
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,040
Even if he dies, he has to resolve the matter.

27
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,430
-But—
-Let him be.

28
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,390
Qian is from the Heaven Path

29
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,860
and is in charge of the palace guards.

30
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,270
It's his duty to save His Majesty.

31
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,140
A military flag?

32
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,579
I ascended the throne when I was young.

33
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,270
I was immoral and reckless,

34
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,070
mistakenly listening to treacherous people,

35
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,530
and dragged the army down.

36
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,450
Fortunately, Chai Ming's group

37
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,410
of 16 men from the Liudao Hall's Heaven Path were brave and loyal.

38
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,800
They used their lives

39
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,360
to help me escape.

40
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,430
I feel guilty to Wu,

41
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,810
all the officials, and the people.

42
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,160
I was too ashamed to live,

43
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,270
but the men of the Liudao Hall were fearless

44
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,940
and saved me from danger.

45
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,940
They should be rewarded heavily.

46
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,530
Your Majesty.

47
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,010
The edict.

48
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,010
The edict.

49
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,520
Your Majesty, it's here.

50
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,150
I already read it.

51
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,310
Keep it safe.

52
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,140
I'm sorry to everyone.

53
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,370
Your Majesty.

54
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:25,810
He's just exhausted.

55
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,510
His life is not at risk anymore.

56
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,430
Come out with me.

57
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,490
I didn't expect

58
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,570
that His Majesty wrote the name clearing edict himself.

59
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,890
Since he is fine now,

60
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:10,410
Qian Zhao,

61
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,070
I’ll leave the rest to you.

62
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,490
You're in charge of taking everyone

63
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,530
to send His Majesty back to the State of Wu safely.

64
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,990
Aren't you going back with us?

65
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,270
Are you going to the An Capital?

66
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,050
Yes.

67
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,250
Her Highness is still in the State of An.

68
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,570
She has been timid since she was young.

69
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,360
I can't leave her alone.

70
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,680
Okay, we'll go with you.

71
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,370
No need.

72
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,570
Go with Qian and the others

73
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,090
and bring His Majesty back safely.

74
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,440
Liar.

75
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,659
Will you still come back?

76
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,010
I told you on the way.

77
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,570
Beauty is saving Her Highness.

78
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,890
Even with Beauty's skills, there still hasn't been any news.

79
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:03,730
I'm afraid...

80
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,150
Your internal force is unstable

81
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,840
and problems occured twice at Donghu Lake yesterday.

82
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,970
You're not going back to save people.

83
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,210
You're going back to die.

84
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:24,610
Boss.

85
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,560
I'm not going back to die.

86
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,050
I've had countless life-or-death experiences,

87
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:37,790
but I never died.

88
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,680
It's fine.

89
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,050
Here, Qian Zhao.

90
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:46,300
The task of

91
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,130
His Majesty and clearing the Heaven Path's name

92
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,730
will be yours now.

93
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:54,909
Here.

94
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,280
I'll leave my old residence to you.

95
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:00,570
Take good care of it for me.

96
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:03,980
Sun Lang,

97
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,370
help me take good care

98
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,180
of the Wu Capital branch.

99
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,600
If I can't come back

100
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,370
and Her Highness still has a chance of survival,

101
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,010
promise me

102
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,180
you will take care of her as your own sister.

103
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:31,930
There is no "if."

104
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,380
Take care of your own sister.

105
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,850
Yes, I won't do it either.

106
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,049
I'm so busy taking care of

107
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:40,049
the dogs and cats every day.

108
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,090
Boss Ning, you come back

109
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,809
and take care of the brothers of the Wu Capital branch yourself.

110
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,250
You are the chief of the Liudao Hall.

111
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,810
If you want to clear the name

112
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:50,820
of your brothers,

113
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,980
you should do it personally.

114
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,700
You always ask me to stay and look after the old residence.

115
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,930
I'm sick of staring at it.

Apart from the rescued Prince Li,

168
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,450
no one else died here?

169
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,010
Many civilians were watching that night.

170
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:00,970
It's true.

171
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,240
So, has the entire Wu delegation escaped?

172
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,830
I heard they entered Donghu Lake for the rescue

173
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,110
when the imperial city was in trouble

174
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,110
and escaped amidst the chaos.

175
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,370
Don't tell anyone I was here.

176
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,210
Yes.

177
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,780
I see it. Around 1.5 miles that way

178
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:15,810
and 1.5 miles ahead,

179
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:16,610
this radius must be investigated.

180
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,610
Let’s go, Mr. Du.

181
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,770
Look at the situation.

182
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,410
We can't delay any longer.

183
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,490
I'm not leaving.

184
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,200
Since Mr. Ning was willing to return to the An Capital

185
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,090
for Her Highness and Ruyi,

186
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,700
how can I shamelessly escape?

187
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,260
Besides,

188
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,130
Her Highness saved my life.

189
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,770
But you're seriously injured.

190
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,070
Besides,

191
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,890
Boss has been gone for hours.

192
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,050
You can't catch up to him.

193
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,310
I can.

194
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,730
No matter how many days it'll take,

195
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,870
I must rush back to the An Capital.

196
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,850
Since I receive a salary,

197
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,110
I must show loyalty.

198
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,050
I left the Wu Capital with Her Highness originally.

199
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,740
I must finish what I started.

200
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,910
If Her Highness and Mr. Ning...

201
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,960
I will bring them back.

202
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,100
Mr. Du, wait.

203
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,010
Your Majesty.

204
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,100
Brave and loyal,

205
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,250
you are a pillar of the country.

206
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,950
I have nothing special on me.

207
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:44,260
I can only give you my cloak.

208
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,900
When you return safely,

209
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:57,410
I'll welcome you warmly in the Wu Capital.

210
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,100
Thank you, Your Majesty.

211
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,740
Return safely.

212
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,410
Thank you, Your Majesty.

213
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,940
[Mansion of Marquis Changqing]

214
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:28,650
Li Tong—

215
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,720
Who are you burning paper money for?

216
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,410
Impossible.

217
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,850
Impossible.

218
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,850
Ruyi is so powerful.

219
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,770
Even Yuanzhou can't beat her.

220
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,010
How could she...

221
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,050
Weren't you promoted to Duke?

222
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,050
Don't you have military power?

223
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,560
Why didn't you save her?

224
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,770
Who is the murderer?

225
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,660
Who is the murderer?

226
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,090
Who is so vicious and despicable?

227
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,010
Tell me. I will kill him.

228
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,410
Mind your own business.

229
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,450
His Majesty has no time to deal with you now,

230
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,980
which is why I can let you stay here for a few days.

231
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,170
You'll suffer when he refocuses.

232
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,400
It's not like he can kill me.

233
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,250
He may not kill you,

234
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:49,690
but he can also

235
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,930
send you to the frigid lands of the Shabei Tribe to herd sheep

236
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,030
or throw you out of Mount Guan.

237
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:55,970
The Beipan people

238
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:58,650
would definitely love a treat like you.

239
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,040
Whether they keep you for themselves

240
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,300
or use you ask to ask the State of Wu for a large sum of ransom,

241
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,079
both are good deals.

242
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:13,010
You can cry if you want.

243
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,050
After tonight,

244
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,990
we may not have time to be sad anymore.

245
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:40,900
No.

246
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,280
I can't die like this.

247
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,170
Ruyi said before

248
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,290
that only weak people would commit suicide.

249
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,690
[Xingshuo Men]

250
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:22,900
Your Highness,

251
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,340
we'll wait for you outside.

252
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,440
Your Majesty, greetings from Li Tongguang.

253
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,880
I have brought Prince Li of Wu as ordered.

254
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,970
Greetings, Your Majesty. I am Yang Ying, the Prince Li of Wu.

255
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,780
Your brother escaped successfully.

256
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,770
You must have contributed a lot.

257
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,770
I don't have much to congratulate you with.

258
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,210
There are three things here.

259
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,590
Just pick one.

260
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,800
You want to force me to commit suicide.

261
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,830
Aren't you afraid of the people's criticism?

262
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,770
Criticism?

263
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:02,070
Prince Li of Wu colluded with the Beipan people to enter Mount Guan

264
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,920
with the intention of disrupting the State of An.

265
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,880
This is an unforgivable crime.

266
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,330
Is taking my life

267
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,250
this important for you

268
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,450
to regain your dignity?

269
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,540
You must be so furious

270
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,980
at being held captive by a Scarlet Guard traitor

271
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,160
before all of the officials.

272
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,010
Give Prince Li another cup.

273
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,170
-How dare you!
-Your Majesty, do you think

274
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,380
that I'm trying to provoke you

275
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,130
or I'm speaking nonsense before my death?

276
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,970
You are wrong.

277
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,540
Duke Qing.

278
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:16,650
I

279
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,850
just want to make a deal with you.

280
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:25,090
What trick are you pulling now?

281
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,210
If you accept it,

282
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:30,020
it will not only help you stabilize the political situation,

283
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,330
but also help you effortlessly clear

284
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,880
your crime of colluding with Beipan.

285
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,490
Okay, I’m listening.

286
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:39,930
Continue.

287
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:45,170
Originally, you wanted another country's princess as the empress,

288
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,110
but you never found a suitable candidate.

289
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,240
I can help you fulfill your old wish.

290
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,700
I'd like to hear

291
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,130
how you can help.

292
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:48,420
Yang Ying, the Princess Licheng of Wu,

293
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,660
greets the King of An.

294
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:00,690
Your Majesty,

295
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:03,890
you've probably seen reports of how I am weak as a woman,

296
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:07,190
but I actually am a woman.

297
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,570
My father

298
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,970
only has three princes, including my brother,

299
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,650
Brother Danyang, and Brother Ying.

300
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,210
To save my brother,

301
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,220
I disguised myself as a man and risked my life,

302
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,660
but they abandoned me

303
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:21,610
in the face of danger.

304
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,210
At this point,

305
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,810
I no longer wish to be loyal to Wu.

306
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,170
Your Majesty.

307
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,000
Judging by their journey,

308
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:41,050
my brother should still be within the State of An,

309
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,730
while Brother Danyang, who is supervising the country,

310
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,160
still hasn't received the news

311
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,840
that they have escaped.

312
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:50,370
In this case, why don't you take advantage of this

313
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:53,130
and announce that you've reached an agreement with my brother?

314
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,000
You sent him back,

315
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,290
while I'm left beind to become the empress of An?

316
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,290
Become the empress?

317
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:04,410
I will also have nine cities as my dowry, including Zecheng, Miancheng, and Jicheng.

318
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,280
This way,

319
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,850
once His Majesty returns,

320
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,010
he will definitely have a conflict with Brother Danyang

321
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,450
over the cession of the cities.

322
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:15,930
In the end,

323
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,330
no matter who wins,

324
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,700
both will suffer great losses.

325
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:22,170
By then,

326
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,740
he will definitely need your help

327
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,250
and form an alliance with him.

328
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:32,770
I remember

329
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,880
that both of your princes are disappointments.

330
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:40,410
Don't you want a new legitimate son

331
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,330
to scheme for Wu's land

332
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,110
as the child of both countries?

333
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:46,660
At that time,

334
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:50,110
who would remember that you bought horses from Beipan in the past?

335
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:57,620
You are truly brave.

336
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,130
If I weren't brave,

337
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:08,280
I wouldn't be able to support my ambition as the empress.

338
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:23,530
No wonder

339
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,500
the State of Wu sent you

340
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,750
to be the emperor's envoy.

341
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,810
My brother has already escaped.

342
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:41,620
Was I not successful enough?

343
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:46,130
You were very successful.

344
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:49,630
However,

345
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:54,360
shouldn't you change your tone now?

346
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,980
Don't refer to yourself as the prince anymore.

347
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,920
You are the empress now.

348
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,700
Why are you so anxious, Your Majesty?

349
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,120
I can change my title

350
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:14,790
after the empress's edict is announced.

351
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:21,890
That's true.

352
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:40,530
Pass my order.

353
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,640
Princess Licheng, please move to the Outer Changhua Palace.

354
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:50,640
Serve her according to the empress's level.

355
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,510
She is granted

356
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:56,010
half of my carriage procession.

357
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:58,770
Thank you, Your Majesty.

358
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,290
Duke Qing, come here.

359
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,510
In Siyi Pavilion,

360
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,130
I have a beloved...

361
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,870
Help me contact Yuanzhou.

362
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,470
Tell him I'm fine.

363
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,680
Tell him not to rush to save me.

364
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:42,040
We can talk about it after my brother is safely sent back to the Stae of Wu.

365
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:43,890
You really are a girl?

366
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,700
Ruyi personally taught me

367
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,280
every day for more than two months.

368
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:54,410
If I couldn't even fool you all,

369
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,840
then I would've truly let her down.

370
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,430
But you couldn't do something so crazy

371
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,730
without telling me anything.

372
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,520
You wouldn't actually save me.

373
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,680
I could only save myself.

374
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,920
You said the emperor of An likes interests the most.

375
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:17,230
The most valuable thing on me

376
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:22,440
is my so-called royal blood.

377
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,900
Li Tongguang, on this one point,

378
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,910
you and I are no different.

379
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,560
Do you think it'll be easy to be the empress?

380
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,040
Do you think His Majesty is that stupid?

381
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:39,890
Just a few empty words—

382
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:40,830
At least,

383
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:44,370
he's willing to take the bait.

384
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,650
At least,

385
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,840
I won't be thrown to the north to herd sheep anymore.

386
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,550
A few days ago,

387
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,930
Yuan Lu asked me

388
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,500
what I would do

389
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,000
if I could return to the Wu Capital safely.

390
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,100
I couldn't answer it back then.

391
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,370
Now, I know.

392
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,010
I don't want to

393
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:20,270
go back to that cold harem,

394
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,850
marry a prince consort that I don't know,

395
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,260
and become an ignorant noble lady.

396
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,130
That feeling just now,

397
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:31,720
that feeling of

398
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:35,770
holding your destiny in your own hands,

399
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,600
felt great.

400
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,040
Yuanzhou said

401
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,900
you want to be the highest-ranking official.

402
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,180
Then,

403
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,890
compared to supporting the Third Prince born by a servant,

404
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,740
wouldn't you have a better chance of success

405
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,520
by supporting the son of a princess?

406
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,950
You're planning quite into the future.

407
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:21,350
The old man isn't even letting you stay inside the palace.

408
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,500
He doesn't believe you at all.

409
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:24,170
Yes,

410
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,180
my actions are restricted,

411
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,490
so please

412
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:34,290
find the remains of Ruyi as soon as possible

413
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:35,480
and bury her.

414
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,360
Otherwise,

415
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:41,520
don't blame me for slandering you before the emperor of An.

416
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,200
I will do my best for my master's funeral.

417
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,450
However,

418
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:51,850
I hope you can wait until you're officially the empress

419
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:55,610
before you order me around.

420
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,890
Is my carriage ready?

421
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,610
Depart.

422
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,260
Ruyi,

423
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:35,090
I don't know if what I did was right or wrong,

424
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,200
but I'm certain

425
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,720
that I like this feeling.

426
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,100
I swear

427
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,120
I won't run away anymore.

428
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,660
I will become strong.

429
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,500
I am the emperor's envoy.

430
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,460
Those who insult me

431
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,610
will be killed without mercy.

432
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:13,800
I

433
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,480
am Prince Li of Wu.

434
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,420
Do you know about how

435
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,650
Prince Li is actually a princess?

436
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:39,660
What do you think?

437
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,920
Princess Licheng has a grand title,

438
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,400
but she is actually a pawn sent by the State of Wu to die.

439
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,700
In terms of power and age,

440
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,760
this marriage is not suitable.

441
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:57,180
Besides, if the new empress really has a son,

442
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,930
aren't you afraid

443
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,450
that Wu will instead take advantage of the marriage

444
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,770
to take over the State of An?

445
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:05,020
After all, you are a warrior in battle.

446
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:06,130
What if one year...

447
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,730
Are you cursing me?

448
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,130
The day you pass,

449
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:12,969
I will follow you underground.

450
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:17,650
What I just said might sound like critique,

451
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,960
but they are sincere words from my heart.

452
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,010
Deng Hui,

453
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:30,650
only you dare to say

454
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,730
these sincere words in front of me nowadays.

455
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:45,050
Critique isn't all I can say.

456
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,739
The engagement can be announced,

457
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:54,040
but the edict should be vague.

458
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,610
Betroth Princess Licheng to the State of An

459
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,250
for a marriage alliance.

460
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:02,130
Your Majesty, don't forget

461
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:05,250
that Second Prince doesn't have a wife yet.

462
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:09,090
A crown princess is much easier to control

463
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,050
than an empress.

464
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,080
Chief?

465
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,950
[Liudao Hall An Capital Branch

466
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,090
How is Her Highness?

467
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:42,930
Her Highness is fine.

468
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,970
She stayed in the Mansion of Duke Qing for a few days.

469
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:47,130
Today, she moved to the Outer Changhua Palace.

470
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:49,490
I even took a look from afar

471
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:50,730
-outside the palace.
-What about Ruyi?

472
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:52,610
Any news about Ruyi?

473
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,490
Where is her body?

474
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,080
The morning before yesterday,

475
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:30,810
Scarlet Guard Commander Deng Hui personally led people

476
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,040
to cremate her in public at the Scarlet Guards' headquarters.

477
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,170
Chief Jin and her people

478
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,790
hid among the Scarlet Guards and saw it.

479
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,950
It's indeed Left Emissary Ren herself.

480
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,430
Chief, I'm sorry for your loss.

481
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:56,850
I've thought about it already.

482
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,460
It's okay.

483
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,040
It's okay.

484
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:03,990
It's okay.

485
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,370
We all lead dangerous lives.

486
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,890
We've long become numb to death.

487
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,930
Prepare some food and wait outside the palace.

488
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,350
If Her Highness escapes

489
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:26,010
and leaves the outer palace,

490
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:28,130
remember to report her whereabouts to me.

491
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:31,560
Gather the men

492
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:33,610
and prepare the weapons.

493
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:36,570
Yes.

494
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:02,290
What farewell do you want me to say to you?

495
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:04,410
What's the point

496
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:06,020

Urgent news!

552
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,700
Is anyone here? Get me another horse.

553
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:24,310
[Posthouse in the State of An]

554
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:23,610
Is anyone here?

555
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:25,010
Anyone? I must send a message.

556
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,590
The emperor of Wu escaped. Capture and bring him to the capital.

557
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,600
Thank you. You won't be delivering this message.

558
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:49,710
Set the sky lantern.

559
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:50,230
Yes.

560
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,100
Set the sky lantern.

561
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,930
Shisan, it's safe ahead.

562
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:16,870
Okay.

563
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:18,970
It's snowing heavily.

564
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,000
We've been travelling every day.

565
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:23,800
Remember to take care of yourself.

566
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:24,650
Have you taken the pills?

567
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:31,010
Ning is so thoughtful.

568
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:32,790
He disabled all the mail pigeons

569
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:33,950
and An posthouses along the way.

570
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,470
Otherwise, the pursuers would be on our tails.

571
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:37,970
Yes.

572
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:39,890
Shisan,

573
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,970
why don't we find something to eat?

574
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:43,210
Everyone

575
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,860
has worked hard these days.

576
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,410
Okay, let's go.

577
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,420
I'll get some water.

578
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:48,170
Okay.

579
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:48,850
Ding Hui.

580
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:49,360
Yes.

581
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:49,940
Come.

582
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:52,490
Take two men to get some water with me.

583
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:52,980
Yes.

584
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:04,180
Where are we?

585
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:05,820
Your Majesty,

586
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,870
we'll reach He County in one more day.

587
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:11,570
He County?

588
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:13,460
Yes.

589
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,100
It's where we were defeated by the State of An.

590
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:18,250
We'll finally come to an end

591
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,960
after this long journey.

592
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:25,340
The victor becomes the king. The loser becomes the outlaw.

593
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:29,160
I've let the people of Wu down.

594
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:31,790
You can have a good rest when we get to He County.

595
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:33,530
I promise

596
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:37,060
you'll be able to sleep comfortably there.

597
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,720
Half of the carriage procession?

598
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,940
Princess Licheng?
