00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:50,350
Lang.

5
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:50,870
What?

6
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,670
Lang, calm down.

7
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,640
You're actually trying to stop me

8
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,539
from killing this unworthy emperor.

9
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,790
They're stopping you

10
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,420
from making a big mistake.

11
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,350
-Shisan.
-Yu.

12
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,510
Great.

13
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,030
Yu Shisan.

14
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,500
Are you also here to stop me?

15
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,590
I can see it.

16
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,160
You're determined to kill him.

17
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,510
I can't stop you.

18
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,079
How about this?

19
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,290
Will you stop me?

20
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,150
Are you crazy? What does it have to do with you?

21
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,390
What does it have to do with me?

22
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,760
You can kill him and get it over with,

23
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,710
but how about the rest of us?

24
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,120
He County and the outpost are nearby.

25
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,790
Do you think those officials

26
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,180
will just let their emperor die without finding out how and why?

27
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,370
If they find something out,

28
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,110
the families of everyone here

29
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,230
will be executed because of you!

30
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,220
Then I'll be indebted to you.

31
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,400
After you get to the underworld,

32
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,630
I'll receive you guys with great wine

33
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,160
and compensate you.

34
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,520
How would you compensate us?

35
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,040
All these years, we've been through thick and thin together,

36
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,850
yet you chose to keep it from us.

37
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,150
We treat you as our brother.

38
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,660
What are we to you?

39
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,100
Qian.

40
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,430
I see you as my brother.

41
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,410
What am I to you?

42
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,340
Enough.

43
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,579
I made too many mistakes.

44
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,430
I made the mistake of underestimating the enemies and acting recklessly,

45
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,950
which endangered the whole country.

46
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,430
I made the mistake of being inept and stupid, the mistake of being arrogant,

47
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,590
and the mistake of being a coward.

48
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,830
It's my fault that my sister and the loyal guards of Liudao Hall

49
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,370
are in such a dilemma.

50
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,670
Diligent and discreet were my forefathers. Long were their admonitions.

51
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,560
I have a guilty conscience and feel so ashamed of myself.

52
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,870
I had ambitions but only have remorse now.

53
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,340
But believe me when I say,

54
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,550
I only wish for my country to prosper.

55
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,740
Don't think a repentant poem

56
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,870
can make me spare your life.

57
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,990
I have it coming.

58
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,150
I've been lying to myself all this time.

59
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,150
I told myself that many emperors in history

60
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,690
got into scrapes

61
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,300
and as long as I could tough it out,

62
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,940
I'd make a comeback one day.

63
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,000
But now I know I don't deserve to rule.

64
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,050
Do it.

65
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:16,630
No.

66
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,910
It's a whistling arrow.

67
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,020
An people are coming after us again.

68
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,510
The smoke is red and white. They're not An people.

69
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,460
It's Beipan.

70
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,960
Beipan?

71
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,200
How did Beipan people get through Tianmenguan?

72
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:34,740
Blue flag.

73
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,150
There's a wolf head on it.

74
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,430
That's the banner of Beipan's Right Worthy Prince.

75
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,770
I have the map.

76
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:48,670
Look.

77
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,400
Tianmenguan is in that direction.

78
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,350
The beacon tower on Yue Mountain is in that direction.

79
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,330
The beacon tower on Zuojia Ridge is over there.

80
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,100
Why is there no smoke from the beacon tower on Zuojia Ridge?

81
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:02,150
There are many Beipan soldiers on Zuojia Ridge.

82
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,480
No.

83
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,000
No, no, no.

84
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,680
The whistling arrow can only be seen within one mile.

85
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,560
The beacon tower on Zuojia Ridge is supposed to warn He County.

86
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,930
They didn't send a smoke signal,

87
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,170
so He County won't be forewarned and prepared.

88
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,990
The tens of thousands of people in He County will be doomed.

89
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,990
Liudao Hall, attention.

90
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,460
Set off to defend the beacon tower right away.

91
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,480
Yes.

92
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,190
Everyone, get on the horse.

93
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,670
I'm not trying to escape.

94
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,590
At this moment, nothing is more important

95
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,420
than protecting the people from the enemies.

96
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,260
After we kill all the Beipan soldiers and keep the beacon tower,

97
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,660
I'll kill you then.

98
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,470
Don't get held up.

99
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,200
The priority is to send a smoke signal.

100
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,159
The priority is to find dry wood to light the beacon.

101
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,710
Qian!

102
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:34,740

113

114

120

Could it be a false alarm?

185
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,260
We'll do this.

186
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,670
Close one of the two gates for now.

187
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:39,650
Yes.

188
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,490
General.

189
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,790
A group of people are coming this way.

190
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,710
Something seems wrong.

191
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,360
My bow.

192
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,870
Who are you?

193
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,140
The emperor of Wu is here.

194
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,640
General Wu, I'm Yu Shisan.

195
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,730
I was in Wu's delegation. We've met before.

196
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:03,770
Do you remember?

197
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:05,410
Yes.

198
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,829
This man in front of you

199
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:09,569
is indeed the emperor of Wu.

200
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,380
I thought you were held captive in An Capital.

201
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,630
Why are you here?

202
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,859
We came to you

203
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,339
with urgent military information.

204
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,550
Give me the hat.

205
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:23,380
General Wu.

206
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:24,990
Tianmenguan has been breached.

207
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,150
Beipan's Right Worthy Prince is pushing south

208
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,140
with an army of 5,000.

209
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,640
This is the hat of a Beipan soldier.

210
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,730
We fought with them

211
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,280
at Zuojia Ridge.

212
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,700
Their main force will arrive in He County soon.

213
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:36,610
Is that true?

214
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,010
We just escaped from An Capital.

215
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,240
We came to warn you at the risk of exposing ourselves

216
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,630
and being held captive again,

217
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,390
because we know how perilous the situation is.

218
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:51,600
Beipan's 5,000 elite soldiers pushed south from Tianmenguan.

219
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,750
They soon breached Ji Mountain, Cangsong Ridge,

220
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,390
Quanwei Ravine, and Qutou Pass

221
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,090
and were headed to He County.

222
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,050
The emperor of Wu, the guards of Liudao Hall, and the 800 soldiers of He County

223
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,000
are under siege now.

224
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,010
General Wu.

225
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,310
He County is strategically important.

226
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,410
Beipan has breached Tianmenguan.

227
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,670
If this place falls too,

228
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,990
30 miles of land from here will fall with it.

229
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,000
But we're outnumbered.

230
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,200
I doubt we can hold He County.

231
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,710
We can. We still have a chance of winning.

232
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,880
The terrain of He County is harsh.

233
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,830
It's easy to defend but hard to attack.

234
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,040
We need to focus on

235
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,110
strengthening the defenses now.

236
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,740
After reinforcements arrive,

237
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,880
we can break the siege and turn the tide.

238
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,200
Your Majesty, you chose to stay to fight the enemies with us

239
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,470
despite our differences.

240
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,600
I'm at your service.

241
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,240
I, Yuan Lu from the Hungry Ghost Path of Liudao Hall,

242
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,830
will defend He County with Your Majesty.

243
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:49,620
Yu Shisan from the Asura Path of Liudao Hall.

244
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,520
Sun Lang, the commandant of Liudao Hall's Human Path.

245
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
Everyone in Liudao Hall

246
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,670
will stay brave in the face of death.

247
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,920
We'll defend He County with Your Majesty.

248
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:59,950
We'll fight to the last breath!

249
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,640
We want to fight too.

250
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,530
This is our home.

251
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,450
We want to fight too.

252
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,430
This is our home.

253
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,010
It's urgent.

254
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:34,500
Yes.

255
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,230
I've sent a messenger pigeon to Wu Capital

256
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,490
to inform my people of the situation here.

257
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,480
Before the reinforcements arrive,

258
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:41,910
we have to hang on.

259
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,830
General Wu, look.

260
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,720
What we eliminated at Zuojia Ridge

261
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,380
was a small advance team of Beipan.

262
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,380
Shisan.

263
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,630
Without Boss Ning here,

264
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,710
do you think we can win?

265
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,130
Your internal force is still unstable?

266
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,700
Yeah.

267
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,390
When you were resting,

268
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,470
I received a letter from the division nearby.

269
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,020
It was left by Qian Zhao and the others when they were in Junzhou.

270
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:52,710
I've gauged the time.

271
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,310
They should've long arrived in He County.

272
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,090
Qian Zhao is very reliable.

273
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,830
He should've sent a message to me.

274
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,660
It's weird that he didn't.

275
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:12,970
What are you doing?

276
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,180
Stop worrying.

277
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,250
Let's just go find them.

278
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,170
But your wounds haven't healed.

279
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,170
The physician said

280
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,590
you're badly injured and shouldn't travel long distances.

281
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:23,770
Don't worry about me.

282
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,730
I can rest after catching up with them.

283
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,050
Besides, in the past,

284
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,970
I suffered wounds worse than these.

285
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:30,870
You're talking about the past again.

286
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,730
How about this?

287
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,630
When we get to the next Jinsha Pavilion

288
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,860
and I get you settled,

289
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,150
I'll go find the emperor of Wu myself.

290
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,600
After sending him back,

291
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,470
I'll come back to you right away, okay?

292
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,340
Ning Yuanzhou.

293
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,990
We're finally together again.

294
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:52,910
Are you going to leave me behind?

295
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:56,210
Have you forgotten

296
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,810
that we're partners that should travel side by side?

297
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:02,970
Okay.

298
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,490
What are you doing?

299
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:06,270
Stop!

300
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,330
I only sell top-quality leather goods.

301
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,200
It's overpriced.

302
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,080
Yes. Give me my money back.

303
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,080
Give us back our money!

304
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,760
You can't leave.

305
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,050
You're being completely unreasonable.

306
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,910
Give us back our money!

307
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,490
It should be just a normal fight.

308
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:17,690
Give us back the money. You can't leave.

309
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:19,280
These are all top-quality products.

310
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,520
-We want our money back.
-They're not fake.

311
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,330
Give the money back!

312
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:22,770
Give our money back, you swindler!

313
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:23,850
You can't leave unless you pay us back.

314
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,400
No.

315
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,730
The thing on his waist is a Beipan badge.

316
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,880
Top quality? You're a swindler!

317
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,920
Let me go.

318
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,070
We don't want your products anymore.

319
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,300
The man just now was a fur trader from Xisai.

320
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,880
Five days ago, he got this thing

321
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,080
from the chieftain of a small Beipan tribe.

322
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,300
The king of Beipan summoned his subjects to Suluyuan.

323
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,420
The chieftain

324
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,220
was rushing there with 200 soldiers.

325
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,540
What did the chieftain exchange that badge for?

326
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,420
Medicine for wounds.

327
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,940
Suluyuan is only about 300 miles away from Tianmenguan.

328
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,030
Beipan has over 100 tribes,

329
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,030
big and small.

330
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:11,250
Something's wrong.

331
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,370
Beipan people must be gathering for some reason.

332
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,140
Yes.

333
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,020
So we have to go to Tianmenguan immediately.

334
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,380
[The first day of the battle at He County]

335
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,670
Full attack!

336
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,300
Fire.

337
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,900
Breach the gate as soon as possible.

338
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,400
Charge!

339
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:52,770
Are you okay?

340
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,100
[The second day of the battle at He County]

341
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,220
[The third day of the battle at He County]

342
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,230
General Wu.

343
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,160
General Wu.

344
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,240
General Wu!

345
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:02,560
-General Wu!
-General Wu!

346
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:03,330
General Wu.

347
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,880
He County…

348
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,890
I'll leave it in your hands.

349
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,890
Kill!

350
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:23,890
Charge!

351
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,560
Sun Lang, we need to kill their commander.

352
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:32,010
Kill them all!

353
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:32,700
Kill!

354
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:33,640
Kill!

355
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:47,880
This way.

356
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:53,860
Come up.

357
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,830
Right Worthy Prince is dead. Retreat!

358
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:28,910
Retreat!

359
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:30,160
Retreat!

360
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,560
We won.

361
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,360
We won!

362
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,380
We won! We won!

363
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,930
We won! We won!

364
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,130
Sun Lang.

365
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:00,690
We made it!

366
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,860
We won! We won!

367
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:12,850
We won! We won!

368
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,670
I'm Sun Lang, the commandant of the Human Path of Liudao Hall.

369
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,630
Greetings, Grand…

370
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,730
Boss Ning.

371
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:30,650
Yuan Lu.

372
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:39,710
What can he do?

373
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,650
Come on. Show the grand councilor what you got.

374
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,640
Yes.

375
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:49,520
Grand Councilor.

376
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:52,840
Tell your men to take me down by all means.

377
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:55,290
Boss.

378
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:58,280
I didn't let you down this time, did I?

379
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:21,990
Lang.

380
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,890
Sun Lang!

381
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,620
Lang!

382
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:42,560
Sun Lang!

383
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:44,400
Lang.

384
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,160
-Lang.
-Sun Lang.

385
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,020
Lang.

386
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,870
Hang in there.

387
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,160
Hang in there. Hang in there.

388
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,090
Shisan, you're the worst.

389
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,050
Aren't you the most handsome man?

390
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,520
You always come so late.

391
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,030
It hurts like hell.

392
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:09,950
Sorry.

393
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,530
Sorry.

394
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:14,610
Sorry.

395
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:19,400
I really want

396
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:22,080
to hold something fluffy.

397
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,030
Shisan.

398
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,090
I'm a hero now, aren't I?

399
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,160
Yes.

400
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,440
You've always been a hero.

401
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,530
You've been a hero

402
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,850
since the very beginning.

Right Worthy Prince is dead.

459
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,370
[The county office of He County]

460
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:20,850
Beipan's king will not let up.

461
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,730
Liudao Hall has learned

462
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:24,890
that Beipan's king

463
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,790
is rallying forces outside Tianmenguan

464
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,880
and has sent Left Worthy Prince to He County.

465
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:34,250
If Beipan goes all out

466
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,710
and attacks us again,

467
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,770
I'm afraid

468
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:39,090
we can't resist it this time.

469
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,530
An has our back.

470
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,700
The reinforcements will arrive in a few days.

471
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,680
Hasn't the messenger we sent to Junzhou

472
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,010
come back?

473
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,240
Sorry, Your Majesty.

474
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:50,050
What happened?

475
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,090
I went to Junzhou

476
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,520
but its regional inspector

477
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,780
wouldn't believe that Beipan had breached Tianmenguan.

478
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,410
Not only that,

479
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,200
but he also wanted to detain me

480
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,790
because Prince Luoxi passed by Junzhou the day before yesterday

481
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,830
on his way back to the capital

482
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:05,040
and said Tianmenguan was impregnable

483
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:07,850
and General Wu had long colluded with Wu

484
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:08,800
to start a rebellion.

485
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,710
I almost died fighting my way back.

486
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,210
How could they be so stupid?

487
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,040
They can easily find out

488
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,050
if there are Beipan people in Tianmenguan

489
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,200
by sending a few scouts out.

490
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,610
The regional inspector of Junzhou is from Shadong Tribe.

491
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,840
Second Prince will become the crown prince after he gets back.

492
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,920
So the regional inspector of Junzhou

493
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:32,710
will believe whatever he says.

494
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,240
You did well. Leave us now.

495
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,090
Yes.

496
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:47,770
The emperor of An sent Second Prince to inspect Tianmenguan.

497
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,560
And Beipan people happened

498
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,810
to breach Tianmenguan at this time.

499
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,370
Something

500
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,650
is fishy.

501
00:36:59,420 --> 00:36:59,960
No.

502
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,420
The Central Plain is at stake and a prince is involved.

503
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,970
We must send someone to An Capital

504
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:07,290
to tell the truth to the emperor of An.

505
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,250
I'll urge Wu to send troops

506
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,200
to reinforce us again.

507
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:12,880
But the problem

508
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,560
is who can go to An Capital to send the message

509
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:16,810
without being stopped

510
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:19,090
at the checkpoints Second Prince set?

511
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:23,970
Your Majesty.

512
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,800
I think

513
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:28,400
we should send Yuan Lu.

514
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,050
Yuan Lu?

515
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,560
Second Prince doesn't know we've come to He County.

516
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:37,080
So he'll only be on guard against An's messengers.

517
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,400
We can let Yuan Lu disguise himself as a young boy.

518
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,210
He's not likely to arouse suspicion.

519
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,420
As long as he enters An Capital,

520
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,120
he can contact Marquis Changqing, Li Tongguang.

521
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,250
Or…

522
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,080
Or he can contact the princess.

523
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,290
With their help,

524
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:53,400
the emperor of An can definitely get to know the real situation.

525
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,200
That's the only way.

526
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,640
It didn't hurt so badly

527
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,960
during the battle.

528
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:08,810
It hurts so much more now.

529
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,230
Let me tell you.

530
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,250
You should be glad that you get to go.

531
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,250
If I hadn't hurt my leg,

532
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,560
this would be my job.

533
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,210
Do you think anyone can go?

534
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,760
-I know.
-It's a favor to you.

535
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:27,570
Take this.

536
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:29,690
It's the military report about He County.

537
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,230
If you lose it,

538
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,920
I'll beat you up.

539
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,550
This badge is from Commandant Zhang.

540
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,980
Use it when you check in inns.

541
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:38,530
Take it out if you get into trouble.

542
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:40,210
Keep it safe.

543
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,330
Besides,

544
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,560
I've prepared naans that can last you for about ten days.

545
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:46,430
They should be enough.

546
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,640
But don't eat only naans.

547
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,690
There's money in the bag.

548
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:53,040
Buy whatever you need and want to eat.

549
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,360
It's getting cold.

550
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,150
Buy some warm clothes for yourself.

551
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:01,010
Have you packed enough pills?

552
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,450
How many bottles have you packed?

553
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:03,450
How many days are they enough for?

554
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:04,840
Yes, I've packed enough!

555
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,020
I'll go get some herbs for you.

556
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,610
Shisan.

557
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,550
Do I have to go?

558
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:18,960
He County is hanging by a thread now.

559
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,440
What are you gonna do if I leave?

560
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,510
Haven't you already sent a messenger pigeon

561
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,030
to An Capital Branch?

562
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:38,920
I'm not going.

563
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,920
I'll stay to fight Beipan with you.

564
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,800
You're not fighting anyone.

565
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:42,240
Are you a brute?

566
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,080
The situation is urgent.

567
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:46,090
What if Li Tongguang doesn't listen to Ye Guang?

568
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,680
Am I to go to him with a limp?

569
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,050
You know how unforgettable my handsome face is.

570
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:50,970
Do you want me to be recognized by everyone at An Capital?

571
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:54,000
Stop nagging.

572
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:55,480
Just do as you're told.

573
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,960
You're the nagging one.

574
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:01,490
Don't exhaust yourself.

575
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,450
When you pass every post,

576
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:05,960
take some rest before you hit the road again.

577
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:06,930
Do you hear me?

578
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:08,570
You're nagging again.

579
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:41,170
It's not like you'll never come back.

580
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:43,360
You will come back and see me again.

581
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,290
No one is losing anyone.

582
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,810
Get on the horse.

583
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,210
Safe travels.

584
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,660
I'll complete the task.

585
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:13,230
Keep this safe.

586
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,060
If you've lost it when I come back,

587
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,560
I won't talk to you anymore.

588
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,740
You think you're a grown man now?

589
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,280
You're just a silly kid.

590
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,960
Don't tell me you've put your amulet badge in it too.

591
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:27,410
Do you think I'm a fool?

592
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,200
You are a fool.

593
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,370
That kid

594
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,800
has grown taller recently.

595
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:44,830
Yu.

596
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,220
You sent him away on purpose, right?

597
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,050
Beipan will come again.

598
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,770
If he dies defending He County too,

599
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:56,810
how can I face Ning

600
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,690
after I go to the underworld?

601
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:05,210
I saw the report Commandant Zhang received.

602
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,770
Beauty is dead.

603
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,960
Her body was burned by Scarlet Guards.

604
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:14,430
Ning went to die with her

605
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:17,280
and didn't intend to come back alive.

606
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,840
Don't be sad.

607
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:27,550
When we're alive,

608
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,370
we should live life to the fullest.

609
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,690
I think Ning,

610
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,080
Qian,

611
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:35,360
and Sun Lang

612
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,320
all died well

613
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,690
without any regrets.

614
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:45,860
Let's go.

615
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:48,690
Who do you think

616
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,680
will behead

617
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,790
this beautiful head of mine?
