After the end of the previous dynasty,

00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,760
it has been chaotic in the recent century.

6
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,990
Northern Province has always been in conflict with the Central Plain.

7
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,200
Although the nine states of Central Plain have their own sides,

00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,540
there has been endless disputes over the years.

The State of Wu is prosperous and the people are strong.

They are seen as a major enemy that Emperor of An wants.

14

In the six years of Yongyou,

15
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,390
Emperor of An started his army to seize the gold mine in west of Wu.

00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:15,730
Kneel!

191
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,140
Kneel! Hurry!

192
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,550
What should we do?

193
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,570
Don't be afraid.

194
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,540
Follow me and play it by ear.

195
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:35,930
Wait, my lord.

196
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,370
I still have a pearl on me.

197
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,470
I'm willing to give it to you.

198
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,850
I just want a complete corpse.

199
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,420
She knows martial arts.

200
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,760
Wait, don't kill her first.

201
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,670
Judging from her moves,

202
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,810
she looks like a Scarlet Guard from the State of An.

203
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,450
Be careful.

204
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,600

No, Ruyi.

Only the dead can keep the secret.

209
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,470
When you entered White Sparrows,

210
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,290
didn't the bird tamer teach you that?

211
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,230
But...

212
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,260
After all, we know each other.

213
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,360
Who are you?

214
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,570
Why are you so powerful?

215
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,030
Don't you want freedom?

216
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,810
This is the best chance.

217
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,370
The branch doesn't know

218
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,630
that we are not among the dead.

219
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,810
But we White Sparrows

220
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,349
must take the antidote every half a year to survive.

221
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:06,109
If we run away now–

222
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,550
The poison is not worth mentioning.

223
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,520
As long as we take 25 grams of rhubarb

224
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,890
when the poison is weakest the day before

225
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,430
the poison takes place, and vomit three times,

226
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,750
the poison will be removed.

227
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,550

228

Believe it or not. It's up to you.

229

How do you know so much?

230
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,589
With your skills, you can even be a Purple Emissaries.

231
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,420
Why are you a White Sparrow like me?

232
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:28,230
I'm such a fool.

233
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:29,930
I always treated you

234
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,320
as a weak woman who knows nothing.

235
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,420
I'm nobody.

236
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,340
I'm just a ghost.

Are you coming with me now?

238
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:39,430
No.

239
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,910
I have to go back to the branch.

240
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,490
Yu Lang is still there.

241
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,380
I can't go alone.

242
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,990
Why did you become a White Sparrow?

243
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,570
To repay the debt.

244
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,810
My brother was sick.

245
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,710
My mother had to sell me.

246
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,050
Your brother is the one who is sick.

247
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,720
Why is your mother selling you?

248
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,530
Is your life not a life?

249
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,770
Ten years ago, for a man,

250
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:02,610
your family sold you.

251
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,820
Ten years later, you're going to get yourself killed again

252
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,070
for another man.

253
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:09,520
Is it worth it?

254
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:12,840
Yes.

260
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,750
I've died in Liudao Hall.

261
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,310

I will bring Han family's grain map over.

Five days ago,

284

our army was defeated by the An army at Tianmenguan.

285

Our army was defeated by the An army at Tianmenguan.

287
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,440
We lost Xu, Cai and Jing, these three cities.

311
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,700

I agree.

375
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,350
It concerns the throne.

376
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,890
How can we be hasty?

377
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,550
The Emperor's death is just a rumor.

378
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,820
There is no evidence.

379
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,590
How could you...

380
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,330
Your Highness,

381
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,390
what do you think?

382
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,540
Since the late emperor is in trouble...

383
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,030
His Majesty is safe.

384
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:31,020
Who dares to call him the late emperor?

385
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:48,160
[Empress Wu Xiao Yan]

386
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,510
Your Majesty.

387
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,300
What do you mean, Your Majesty?

388
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,550
Long live Your Majesty!

389
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,540
My cousin Xiao Ming

390
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,750
went on this expedition with His Majesty too.

391
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,220
I just received a secret letter.

392
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,090
In the letter it said, although His Majesty lost,

393
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,430
his is still alive.

394
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:26,950
He's currently staying in the An army as a guest.

395
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:34,980
Not only that,

396
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,200
I am pregnant now.

397
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,270
According to the imperial physicians,

398
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,710
there's a 90% chance that it's a boy.

399
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,370
Prince Danyang.

400
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:49,520
When you were studying in the Imperial Study with His Majesty,

401
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,980
the late emperor personally taught you.

402
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,410
Now, you two are practically brothers.

403
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,400
You haven't forgotten, have you?

404
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,570
Now His Majesty is in trouble.

405
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:05,550
As an example of the royal family,

406
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:07,530
could you, Brother Danyang, help His Majesty

407
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,200
and the prince in my womb

408
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,170
to watch this throne.

409
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,690
I will be cautious

410
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,450
and not let what His Majesty asked me of when he left the capital.

411
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:42,690
However,

412
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,630
how do you know

413
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:49,190
you're definitely carrying a prince?

414
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,950
When the country is in danger,

415
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,200
the Empress is pregnant.

416
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,990
It's great news for our country.

417
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,550
In my opinion,

418
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,910
it's better to keep the status quo

419
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,400
and have Prince Danyang as the supervisor.

420
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,270
After the Empress gives birth,

421
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,880
we will decide on the country's leader based on the child's gender.

422
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,840
Please help the people,

423
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:19,150
Your Majesty.

424
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,470
We agree.

425
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:34,500
I've heard about what happened at the court meeting just now.

426
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,470
Prince Danyang is in power now.

427
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,420
It's hard to control him.

428
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,380
Fortunately, the Empress is pregnant.

429
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:41,770
Even if she can't give birth to a prince,

430
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,570
as long as you give the order,

431
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,670
I can get one too.

432
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:47,350
There's no way Prince Danyang

433
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,720
can be more obedient than a kid.

434
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,240
Wait.

435
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,110
His Majesty has fallen.

436
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,910
Why is the news from General Xiao?

437
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,370
Yet Liudao Hall's Heaven Path that protects His Majesty

438
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:02,150
has sent no news at all.

439
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,030
This...

440
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,820
The scout from Animal Path

441
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,870
hasn't sent any news for days.

442
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,370
He must be slacking off.

443
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:13,270
I will go–

444
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,800
Hasn't sent any news yet?

445
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:16,930
The Animal Path's news

446
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,090
are reported every other day.

447
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,180
You've taken over Liudao Hall for so long,

448
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,950
yet you still haven't figured that out?

449
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,070
I'm incompetent.

450
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,450
No wonder

451
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:30,170
people are complaining about Liudao Hall.

452
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,300
I was so stupid

453
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,900
to abolish Ning Yuanzhou and promote you

454
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:39,720
to Liudao Hall.

455
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,310
I've been sick for so long.

456
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,810
I have to see

457
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:46,810
what you have done

458
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,410
my Liudao Hall?

459
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,260
[Wudu Six Hall]

460
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,060
[Six Hall rules]

461
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,560
Tell me.

462
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,690
where does the Liudao Hall stand in

463
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,570
Wu State's court?

464
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:54,130
Yes.

465
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,960
Liudao Hall was founded by Taizu.

466
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,680
It specializes in detective work.

467
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,870
There are six paths in the hall.

468
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,280
[Heaven]

469
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,240
The Heaven Path

470
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,610
is in charge of royal security.

471
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:09,949
[Human]

472
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:09,850
Human Path

473
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,650
monitors all officials.

474
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:13,870
Asura Path

475
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:16,929
does work on prostitution.

476
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,020
[Luo]

477
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,070
These three paths are called Three Virtue Paths.

478
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,080
They are called the calvaries.

479
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:25,010
The remaining three paths are called the Three Evil Paths.

480
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,969
They are named as scouts.

481
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,610
Hungry Ghost Path

482
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:28,310
[The Way of Aguis]

483
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,710
is good at making traps.

484
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:30,989
Animal Path

485
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,840
specializes in spying.

486
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:33,949
Hell Path

487
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,739
is famous for assassination.

488
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,000
[Prison]

489
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,510
Hell Path has long been changed to Palace of Hell

490
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,790
which analyzes various information by Ning Yuanzhou.

491
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,320
What assassination are you talking about?

492
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:53,630
I see.

493
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,020
The past Liudao Hall heads

494
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:00,820
are mostly from the noble Three Virtue Paths.

495
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,720
And you're from the Human Path.

496
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,280
You've been a cavalry for generations.

497
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:11,050
You thought you'd have a chance to become the head

498
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,610
after Old Chief Song passed on.

499
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:15,650
But you didn't expect

500
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,830
he promoted Ning Yuanzhou

501
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,820
from Three Evil Paths's Hell Path.

502
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,700
Of course you hate him.

503
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,570
Am I right?

504
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:31,820
No.

505
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,150
I remember Ning Yuanzhou

506
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:38,830
arranged for Animal Path to be planted in various states

507
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,020
and set up 108 secret reports points.

508
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,230
But now,

509
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,470
why are there so few pigeons?

510
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,120
They all flew out.

511
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,190
Is that so?

512
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,310
Ning Yuanzhou has also reformed the Hell Path.

513
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:11,610
The priests who were supposed to retire due to injuries would come to Palace of Hell

514
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,870
to analyze and summarize the secret reports

515
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:15,830
to all departments.

516
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:28,990
But now,

517
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:41,070
Where are the secret reports? Where are the memorandums?

518
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,520
I...

519
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:46,190
I...

520
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:47,740
After you took charge,

521
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:50,010
you destroyed them all.

522
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:51,710
All of them?

523
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,120
Ruining our own ears and eyes.

524
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,850
No wonder His Majesty lost such a miserable battle.

525
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:03,630
I was wrong.

526
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,180
Uncle.
Shut up!

527
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,640
You're just a concubine's nephew.

528
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,740
You don't deserve to call me that.

529
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:11,910
Listen carefully.

530
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:14,500
If it weren't for your aunt,

531
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,070
I would have killed you.

532
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:26,360
Go to the prison

533
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,690
and bring out Ning Yuanzhou.

534
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,250
I'm going to send him to the State of An.

535
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,150
To the State of An.

536
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,470
The State of An?

537
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,680
I want him to see

538
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,550
if His Majesty is still alive.

539
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,750
Didn't Ning Yuanzhou stake out in the State of An before?

540
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:47,350
I want him to get the emperor

541
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,330
before Prince Danyang

542
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:53,400
and pass the edict to pass the throne to the baby in Her Majesty's womb.

543
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:56,170
But Ning Yuanzhou went to the battlefield with His Majesty this time.

544
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,350
And His Majesty...

545
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:59,550
I'm afraid we won't be able to

546
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:01,480
f-find Ning Yuanzhou in a short time.

547
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:02,510
What?

548
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,550
You can't find him?

549
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:05,440
Lord.

550
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,870
Not just exiling him.

551
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,650
You wanted to kill him?

552
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:10,630
You...

553
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,260
Bring Ning Yuanzhou to see me in seven days.

554
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:15,180
Otherwise,

555
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,280
I'll ask your aunt to pay tribute to you next Qingming Festival.

556
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:20,790
Yes.

557
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:42,850
Lord.

558
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:44,610
What should we do?

559
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,790
Within seven days,

560
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,450
find Ning Yuanzhou.

561
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:53,890
But

562
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,510
isn't he already dead at the...

563
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,470
What if he isn't?

564
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,410
He’d come home if he’s alive.

565
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:02,320
Ask Xu Jun to find him.

566
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:05,020
My lord. Xu Jun...

567
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,560
is dead.

568
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,780
What?

569
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,420
The bodies of the four people under Xu Jun

570
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:14,270
were found in the backyard of the Shiyi Mansion.

571
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,770
I think something went wrong

572
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:17,710
when he was dealing with the dancers.

573
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,670
I've checked.

574
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,090
Among those dancers,

575
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,170
are probably some Scarlet Guards.

576
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:27,250
Scarlet Guards who can be a dancer

577
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:29,890
can only be the lowest ranked White Sparrows.

578
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:33,200
Since when did the White Sparrows have such masters?

579
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,670
-Lord.
-Let Mr. Yue take action in advance.

580
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,110
Prime Minister Zhang is still angry.

581
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,070
If we can't find Ning Yuanzhou,

582
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,090
we can only use this achievement

583
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:44,950
to make it up for it.

584
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,040
Yes.

[Wudu Xiyuan Lane]

586
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,910
Why isn’t Ling Long here yet?

587
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,830
Did something happen at the branch?

588
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:35,850
I have to go back to the branch.

589
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:37,240
Yu Lang is still there.

590
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,920
I can't go alone.

[Wudu Zhu Yi Guards Branch]

00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:14,980
Check over there.

594
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:16,640
Search carefully.

595
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:17,840
Yes.

00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:22,760
You guys go over there.

597
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,650
Yes, Sir.

598
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:25,160
Search carefully.

599
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:25,830
Yes.

00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:49,370
Don't worry, lord.

601
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,060
It's just a cat fight.

602
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:55,820
Mr. Yue.

603
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:59,760
Are all the Scarlet Guards from Wu Capital Branch

604
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,320
here?

605
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:03,640
They are all here.

606
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,900
Yesterday, the Wu Capital Branch

607
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:08,080
received a report from Shiyi Mansion that White Sparrows were found.

608
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,820
All the people here have been transferred to

609
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,460
Wu Capital Branch to gather.

610
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:14,370
No one is missing.

611
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,760
47 lives in total.

612
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:18,170
For only 3,000 gold pieces.

613
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,800
It's a bargain for you.

614
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:23,350
Not one is missing?

615
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:26,030
But I don't believe

616
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,610
White Sparrows who only care about finding out information through seduction

617
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:33,030
can kill four of my capable subordinates.

618
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:36,530
Are you questioning me, Mr. Zhao?

619
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:41,410
I just want to avenge my dead brothers.

A spy's corpse

621
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,050
will never have a ghost.

Even so,

Mr. Yue,

626
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:56,730
please make it clear.

627
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,050
Except the people from the Wu Capital Branch,

628
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,630
have you ever sent

629
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:05,260
sent any other masters here?

630
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:07,060
No.

631
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,890
Our deal is done.

00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,150
Where is the money?

00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,640
Who is this Mr. Yue

634
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,510
from the Scarlet Guards?

635
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:30,850
He's a ruthless man.

47 colleagues died on the spot.

637
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:36,590
They didn't even blink.

638

They are just some

639
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:43,430
lowly White Sparrow Scarlet Guards.

00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,890
Someone will fill it in when they die.

641
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:51,220
Did you interrogate that White Sparrow

642
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:52,870
called Ling Long?

643
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,260
Yes.

644
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:59,300
She only admitted to it after

645
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,090
I broke all her bones.

00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:04,300
Her intimate lover

647
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,670
died with her?

00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,240
How could it be?

He's Mr. Yue's trusted aide.

650

Mr. Yue only took him away.

But I still think

652
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,350
she can't do such a big thing alone.

Search this place again.

00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:29,490
Search the city strictly these days.

If there is really an escaped Scarlet Guard,

656

they will try their best to get out of the city.
