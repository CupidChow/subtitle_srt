[A Journey To Love]

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,039
[Episode 25]

4
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,200
You sure were the Left Emissary of Scarlet Guards.

5
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,960
You sure are the Chief of Liudao Hall.

6
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,289
But unfortunately,

7
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,130
even if you're invincible,

8
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,490
you can't survive in a hail of arrows.

9
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,570
Within half an hour,

10
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,010
all the Yulin Guards stationed nearby

11
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,290
will come here.

12
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,400
Can you kill all of us

13
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,410
within half an hour?

14
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,610
I'm the Chief of Liudao Hall

15
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:27,930
not only because of this,

16
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,170
but also because of this.

17
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:38,690
Let me tell you.

18
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,130
Jia Ling

19
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,810
was the one who killed the Scarlet Guards

20
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,690
of Wu Capital Branch.

21
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,170
Today, we're here to avenge them.

22
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:47,850
So we will

23
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,740
take her life.

24
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,920
I give you two options.

25
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:52,970
First,

26
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,890
stay and die with her.

27
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:57,610
Second,

28
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,850
leave here immediately

29
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,840
and pretend you never came here tonight.

30
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,650
Otherwise, even if you survived by luck,

31
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,970
Deng Hui would still see you as Jia Ling's accomplices

32
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,230
and punish you tomorrow.

33
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:10,680
Nonsense!

34
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,450
Don't listen to him.

35
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,050
I know you all work under Jia Ling.

36
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,810
But tonight,

37
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,780
I only want to kill the culprit.

38
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,300
I won't come after you.

39
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,120
You have my word.

40
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,329
Shan Hu. Lu Geng.

41
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,690
Yes.

42
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,770
Since I, Ren Xin, joined Scarlet Guards,

43
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,730
have I ever

44
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,130
gone back on my word?

45
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,050
No.

46
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:51,870
You didn't have a choice

47
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,710
when you joined Scarlet Guards.

48
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,930
But you do now.

49
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,540
Don't listen to him.

50
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,510
Do you hear the hoofbeats?

51
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,630
Yulin Guards will arrive soon.

52
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,210
You're such a big fool.

53
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,210
Have you forgotten

54
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,650
who the General of Yulin Guards

55
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,280
is now?

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,870
Marquis Changqing.

57
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,880
He's Left Emissary Ren's disciple.

58
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,210
They're by the river.

59
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,730
Retreat.

60
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,840
Retreat.

61
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,210
Don't go! Come back!

62
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,330
It's Master's silver needle.

63
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:22,530
Marquis.

64
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,050
The view here is great.

65
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,010
But it seems

66
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,400
it's going to rain.

67
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,130
And the rain

68
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,770
will wash away many things.

69
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:41,930
Yes.

70
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,690
Remember. At a quarter to midnight,

71
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,700
Yulin Guards heard a whistling arrow

72
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,250
and came to the riverbank of Qingxi River.

73
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,650
8 dead Scarlet Guards were found, 6 males and 2 females.

74
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,050
Nothing else was found.

75
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,090
We suspect they died in internal strife.

76
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:56,510
Yes.

77
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,530
You guessed right again.

78
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,210
She's indeed alive.

79
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,890
I've asked many people,

80
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,570
but I still want to hear it from you.

81
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,610
Why did you kill all the Scarlet Guards

82
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,210
of Wu Capital Branch?

83
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:00,050
Just to cover up the 3,000 taels of gold you embezzled?

84
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,010
What else could it be?

85
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:06,970
Unlike Chen Gui,

86
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,410
I'm not under the wings of some prince.

87
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,970
We're women.

88
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,250
Female Scarlet Guards have no future.

89
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,250
I had to plan for myself.

90
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,830
So I needed money.

91
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,530
A lot of money.

92
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,210
My godmother

93
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,530
and Ling Long's family,

94
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,010
did you give the order to kill them as well?

95
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,470
At this point,

96
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,010
is that still important?

97
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:42,289
Yes.

98
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,740
They were all living people.

99
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,330
This world was cruel to those women too.

100
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,130
To save your own hide,

101
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,770
you killed 47 people.

102
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,370
You were sold here.

103
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,530
An people are not your people.

104
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:00,910
Why do you care about them?

105
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,330
You have blood on your hands too,

106
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,170
or you wouldn't still be alive.

107
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,560
I ended up in your hands today

108
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,400
just because I was unlucky.

109
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,670
It doesn't mean

110
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,790
you're innocent.

111
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,250
Chief Ning.

112
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,090
You're smitten with her, aren't you?

113
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,290
Let me tell you.

114
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,370
She's just pretending.

115
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,410
She's like me.

116
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,530
We both started out as White Sparrows and fought our way here.

117
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,490
It was our job to fake smiles and seduce men.

118
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,610
You have no idea of the appalling things she did.

119
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,380
You can't believe a word she says.

120
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:00,930
In my heart,

121
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,650
no matter what she did before,

122
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,410
she's still different from you.

123
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,610
And I can tell you

124
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,970
I'm not a good man either.

125
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,160
So we're a perfect match.

126
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:19,930
Why?

127
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,410
Why do you get to be with such a nice man?

128
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:25,790
While I…

129
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,980
I tried so hard to climb up the ladder

130
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,640
and finally got to where I am today.

131
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,210
But they deceived me again and again.

132
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,330
They insulted me and looked down on me.

133
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:37,850
Why?

134
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,160
His Majesty accused me of killing Empress Zhaojie.

135
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,170
Was it really because of Deng Hui?

136
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,130
If I tell you,

137
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,860
can you give me a quick death?

138
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,210
If you promise me one thing,

139
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,290
I'll tell you.

140
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,290
What's it?

141
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,410
Disguise my body

142
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,910
to make it look like I die fighting a Beipan spy.

143
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:34,840
Why?

144
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,580
She wants to be like Chen Gui

145
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,040
who died in the line of duty

146
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,450
and got a posthumous promotion.

147
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:41,850
That's right.

148
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,650
I'll pay for blood with blood.

149
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,650
But I don't want

150
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,090
to die quietly like other Scarlet Guards

151
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,440
who were only names that got erased.

152
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:02,250
I…

153
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,800
I want my brother to know

154
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,460
that I'm not just a White Sparrow

155
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,460
who only knows to seduce men,

156
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,250
that I deserve a decoration from the court,

157
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,230
and that I won't bring disgrace upon my family.

158
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,610
If you don't promise to do that,

159
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,050
I'll bite my tongue off and bleed to death.

160
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,530
I promise you.

161
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,250
Do you swear on Empress Zhaojie?

162
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,050
I swear on Empress Zhaojie.

163
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:53,850
Okay.

164
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,490
I believe you.

165
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,270
I'll tell you now.

166
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,450
It was not Deng Hui.

167
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,720
Then who was it?

168
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,760
Ren Xin, you fool.

169
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,110
You went to save Her Majesty.

170
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,920
Why did she refuse to leave with you?

171
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,170
In this world,

172
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:28,450
who's the one Her Majesty would've willingly died for?

173
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:38,770
Make it clear.

174
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:40,730
Who was it?

175
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,510
Don't you get it?

176
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,650
Who was it?

177
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,520
Don't forget

178
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,880
what you promised me.

179
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:06,450
Who was it?

180
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,170
Who was it?

181
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,370
Who was it?

182
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,300
She's dead.

183
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,530
Pills. My pills.

184
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,050
-Give me your pills. Your Daxu Pills.
-Ruyi, she's dead.

185
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,160
I need to know the answer.

186
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,840
I must know the answer.

187
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,090
You already know the answer.

188
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,620
She made it clear enough.

189
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,690
I don't know! I don't know anything!

190
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:33,890
She was lying.

191
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,770
She was full of lies.

192
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:37,970
-She was lying to me!
-Ruyi!

193
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,250
You've long guessed who it was

194
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,810
and just wouldn't believe it.

195
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,050
Otherwise, why did she not dare

196
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,610
to say that man's name before she died?

197
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:08,650
Why?

198
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:12,850
Empress Zhaojie was so nice.

199
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,170
How could he do that?

200
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:20,930
How could he do that?

201
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:21,690
Ruyi.

202
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:37,320
♫The sword reflects the cold radiance of the frost in the passes and mountains♫

203
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,400
Your Majesty.

204
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:37,890
Leave!

205
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:44,080
♫Life and death in the martial world♫

206
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,290
I'm not leaving.

207
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:40,530
Don't come in!

208
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,130
Your Majesty, let's go.

209
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:50,590
♫For whom chivalrous men cross the river together, there is no regret♫

210
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,570
You always do what I say.

211
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,290
I order you to leave.

212
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:57,080
♫We were once in love♫

213
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,110
I order you to go to a new place

214
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,580
and live happily for me.

215
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:03,470
♫Right and wrong, happiness and sorrow♫

216
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,620
But you must remember one thing.

217
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,570
In your life,

218
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,930
don't easily fall in love with any man.

219
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:09,500
♫But my world is tearful now when the spring breeze blows♫

220
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:15,890
♫Drinking in the windy snow as the snow turns to ashes♫

221
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:22,090
♫Lamenting that separations are irrevocable♫

222
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,470
Your Majesty.

223
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:28,690
♫When I look back, it's the end of the earth; where do I go from here?♫

224
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:27,740
Your Majesty.

225
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,750
♫When the wine is cold, who will get drunk with me for the rest of my life?♫

226
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:40,960
♫A loyal heart broken yet remains fearless♫

227
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:47,410
♫Hoping to be together in a dream, just to meet you♫

228
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:53,530
♫How many years has it been?♫

229
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:56,590
♫Having to sober up♫

230

♫After losing the one to spend the rest of my life with♫

231
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:12,380
[Siyi Pavilion]

232
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:23,450
Your Highness.

233
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,849
It's time to go.

234
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:35,670
Qian Zhao.

235
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:37,530
Take good care of her for me.

236
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:38,650
I will.

237
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,690
Greetings, Your Majesty.

238
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,610
Your brother is still in prison.

239
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:24,450
But look at you.

240
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,760
You're actually wearing a smile.

241
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,050
Your Majesty,

242
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,650
you've allowed me to leave with my brother.

243
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,140
Thinking that I can go home with my brother soon,

244
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,290
I can't help but feel delighted.

245
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,830
You beardless boy.

246
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,160
How glib you are.

247
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,410
I'm truly happy.

248
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,770
If you hadn't mercifully allowed me

249
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,970
to go back to Wu with my brother,

250
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,330
I'd perhaps keep being a prince

251
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:53,690
without power and position

252
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,970
for the rest of my life.

253
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,530
You made me a big hero.

254
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,980
Of course I'm happy.

255
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,900
You're surprisingly humble.

256
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,970
I just know my place.

257
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,570
Have you brought the gold?

258
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,330
50,000 taels of gold are right outside the court.

259
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,970
The other 50,000 taels have been exchanged for banknotes.

260
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,580
As soon as my brother returns to Wu,

261
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,970
you'll have them.

262
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,310
You've got some nerve to play such a trick.

263
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,420
Marquis Changqing.

264
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,970
Go get those 50,000 taels of gold.

265
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,290
Yes, Your Majesty.

266
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,210
Your Majesty.

267
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:43,090
When can I get my brother out of the pagoda?

268
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,930
I need to deal with something else.

269
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,410
Let's talk about it another time.

270
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,900
Do you mean Beipan's troops that are pushing south?

271
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:58,430
An outsider is not to meddle in my affairs of state.

272
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,970
Your Highness, please.

273
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,210
Your Majesty, His Highness shouldn't have mentioned Beipan,

274
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,180
but since you've taken the ransom, you should keep your word

275
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,570
and release our emperor.

276
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:13,560
Get him out.

277
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,260
Your Majesty!

278
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:15,640
Your Majesty!

279
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,900
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

280
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,150
I know my and my brother's lives

281
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:22,050
are both in your hands.

282
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,690
But please hear me out.

283
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:25,450
Go ahead.

284
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,170
Your Majesty, if your goal is to conquer other countries,

285
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:36,580
you have to let me and my brother return to Wu.

286
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:43,850
You won a triumphant victory over Wu at Tianmenguan,

287
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,130
but why didn't you push on?

288
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:49,130
Because the Yang family has been in control of Jiangnan for generations.

289
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,370
We lost one battle

290
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,850
but we're still very powerful.

291
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,930
You just won a narrow victory.

292
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,190
If your troops had marched forward,

293
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,260
we'd both have suffered great losses.

294
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,290
My brother is your hostage now.

295
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,240
Instead of taking his life,

296
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:06,120
why have you let me come to An to buy his freedom with gold?

297
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,570
Because that war

298
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,220
drained your treasury

299
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,650
and you wish to seize

300
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,450
Chu's ill-protected cities like Cang and Run

301
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,330
as soon as possible.

302
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:17,210
So you need the gold of Wu

303
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,690
to fund the coming war.

304
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:22,070
Your Majesty, gold matters a lot,

305
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,120
but does it matter more than an emperor's integrity?

306
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,930
Now, the whole world knows I've come to An.

307
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,830
If I can't return to Wu with my brother soon,

308
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,160
when war breaks out,

309
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,710
will any general believe your promise

310
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,960
that you'll spare his life if he surrenders the city?

311
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,230
For the reasons above,

312
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,910
I hope you can reconsider your decision.

313
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,320
Then how can you guarantee

314
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,100
that after I let you and your brother go back to Wu,

315
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:59,130
I'll receive all the banknotes you exchanged those 50,000 taels of gold for?

316
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,390
My brother Prince Danyang is the regent now.

317
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,770
After the emperor goes back, they'll fight for the throne

318
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,850
and Wu will be thrown into chaos.

319
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:09,610
Your Majesty.

320
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,770
50,000 taels of gold for civil unrest in Wu.

321
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,010
Isn't it a good deal?

322
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:43,850
You're smarter than I thought.

323
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:51,200
Interesting. Interesting.

324
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,450
It's my honor

325
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,130
to amuse you.

326
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,460
I shall take my leave.

327
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,920
See Prince Li out for me. Reward him with delicacies.

328
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,660
Also,

329
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,690
send the same reward to Yong'an Pagoda.

330
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:23,890
An people are quite efficient.

331
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,570
Before you came back to Siyi Pavilion,

332
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:28,010
these dishes had arrived.

333
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,240
The emperor of An is implying

334
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,850
that he's been aware of everything about us

335
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,110
since we arrived in An.

336
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,570
Anyway, I did my best just now

337
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,200
and said everything I could think of.

338
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,090
Mr. Ning.

339
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,370
What do you think are the chances that the emperor of An

340
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,410
will let us leave?

341
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,970
It's hard to say.

342
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,400
If I were him,

343
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,010
I'd take my time to decide that too.

344
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,850
I'd keep you here for a while

345
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,910
and see how Wu would respond.

346
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:01,770
However,

347
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,890
judging from his reaction so far,

348
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:07,020
it may not be easy to let him release His Majesty.

349
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,170
So from today onwards,

350
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,180
we need to make preparations

351
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,610
to attack the pagoda to save His Majesty.

352
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:16,850
If you fail,

353
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:17,890
His Majesty and His Highness…

354
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,650
Compared with the enemy's kindness,

355
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,330
our swords are more reliable.

356
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,730
You're right. I'm narrow-minded.

357
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:31,090
You've gained great insight after arriving in An Capital, Your Highness.

358
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,350
Your Highness.

359
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,370
There's something I need to do. I'll take my leave.

360
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:48,530
-Mr. Ning is…
-Mr. Du.

361
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:51,170
Ruyi hasn't woken up.

362
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,650
Yuanzhou has been worried sick.

363
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,370
How is Ruyi?

364
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:58,850
I didn't see any physical injuries.

365
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,720
I've used all the medicines that I think may help

366
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,090
but still can't bring down her fever.

367
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:05,170
She must have collapsed because she was too sad.

368
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,440
Beauty

369
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,270
was much stronger than ordinary people.

370
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:10,850
She's devastated this time.

371
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:14,770
I can heal a wound, but I can't mend a broken heart.

372
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,770
She has many old internal injuries.

373
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:21,170
I once hurt her too.

374
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:22,770
Sorry.

375
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,700
What should we do, Boss?

376
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,590
How about I go out

377
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,050
to find some physicians to check on her?

378
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,970
No. That's too dangerous.

379
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:35,570
Is ginseng soup one of the dishes just now?

380
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:36,330
Yes.

381
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,710
I'll get it with you.

382
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:38,320
Okay.

383
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:43,980
Shisan.

384
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,130
Go get me some…

385
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:49,850
Are you crazy?

386
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:51,920
Do as I say. Go.

387
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:06,520
Wait.

388
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,970
Ning, are you sure?

389
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,190
This is ice.

390
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,610
Can she stand it?

391
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,790
The ice can definitely bring her fever down.

392
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,310
But I won't use it on her directly.

393
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,320
Then how are you going to use it?

394
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:21,890
I have my ways.

395
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:45,850
Ruyi.

396
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,610
Wake up.

397
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:51,330
Ying,

398
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:52,930
Yuan Lu,

399
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:55,370
Qian Zhao, and Sun Lang

400
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:57,690

♫The blade's glint hides the tears♫

410
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:23,500

♫At the end of the road, it's a dream♫

422

429
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,410
You're such a fool.

430
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,440
You haven't recovered fully from the injuries you got in He County.

You shouldn't be doing this to yourself.

00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,490
Why didn't you put me in the ice?

435
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,850
I was once punished to stay in an icy spring.

436
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:27,570
I can stand it.

437
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,850

Careful.

451
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:28,910
Here.

452
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,270
Let me wipe your mouth.

453
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,900
Are you feeling better?

454
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:48,370
Jia Ling…

455
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:50,970
Don't worry.

456
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,630
I've arranged everything as she wished.

457
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:55,730
Thank you.

458
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,200
However,

459
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,670
the posthumous promotion she wanted

460
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:03,260
may not be given to her.

461
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,140
Ying entered the court today to meet the emperor of An.

462
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,690
He was quite calm.

463
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,130
Maybe Deng Hui

464
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,860
hasn't reported to him what happened last night.

465
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:19,090
What would you do

466
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,910
if you were him?

467
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,800
If I were Deng Hui,

468
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:31,730
I'd say

469
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,360
Jia Ling colluded with Beipan people

470
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:36,200
and tried to kill Li Tongguang,

471
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,510
and that she killed Left Emissary Chen Gui too.

472
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,130
In the end,

473
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,850
I'd add that it was all thanks to me, Commander Deng,

474
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,810
that she was lured to the riverbank and killed.

475
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,350
This way, I could give the emperor of An a satisfying answer

476
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:53,010
and eliminate the Scarlet Guards who were against me.

477
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,260
Kill two birds with one stone.

478
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:57,220
So,

479
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:59,770
Jia Ling's last wish

480
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,720
won't be fulfilled.

481
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:05,890
Does everyone in the court

482
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:08,590
bend the truth

483
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,290
and call black white like this?

484
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:14,600
That's why

485
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:17,350
I always want to stay away from the court.

486
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,920
Do you think

487
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,690
I can believe what Jia Ling said?

488
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:44,370
I haven't told you this.

489
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:47,230
The other day, the division

490
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,310
reported a court secret.

491
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:51,090
Before your accident,

492
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:52,790
when An was at war with Su,

493
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,840
the emperor of An colluded with Beipan and bought horses from them.

494
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,330
Empress Zhaojie wanted to stop him after she knew it

495
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,010
and said it was collaboration.

496
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:02,810
The emperor of An couldn't out-argue her and felt humiliated.

497
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:06,810
He threatened to depose her if she mentioned that matter again.

498
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:10,850
Are you saying

499
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,500
His Majesty actually conspired with Beipan

500
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,140
and Her Majesty fell out with him

501
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:18,980
because she tried to stop him?

502
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:22,990
I'm not sure about it.

503
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,120
After all, it's just a rumor.

504
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,970
The truth may have been twisted.

505
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:28,650
Anyway,

506
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:32,440
it's weird that he accused you of killing Empress Zhaojie.

507
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,030
It's as if he made you the scapegoat

508
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,250
to cover up something.

509
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:38,850
I'll find out the truth.

510
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,810
No matter who killed Empress Zhaojie,

511
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:44,170
I'll make him pay.

512
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,270
[Two days later, Siyi Pavilion]

513
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,370
This is the list of gifts

514
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:56,290
that Her Highness will bring with her tomorrow.

515
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,450
Go prepare them.

516
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:58,180
Yes.

517
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:04,570
I was looking for you.

518
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:06,470
Me?

519
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:07,970
I need a medicine

520
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:09,570
that can make the taker groggy

521
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,140
and easy to control.

522
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,390
Can you make it for me?

523
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,170
No need to make it. I have a ready-made one.

524
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,080
This is what Her Highness's ring is soaked with.

525
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:23,180
After it wears off, most people who take it

526
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:25,180
will not remember what has happened.

527
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:27,610
Thank you.

528
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:28,890
Stay safe.

529
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,130
Ruyi.

530
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:36,110
Ying.

531
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,170
Yuanzhou.

532
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:40,460
Let her go.

533
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:43,690
Aren't you going with her?

534
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,290
She's going to find out some secret of the royal family.

535
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:48,930
We'd better stay out of it.

536
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:50,880
What we need to do now

537
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,340
is wait for her to come back safely.

538
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:53,890
But…

539
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:55,830
Ying.

540
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:58,130
We all have secrets.

541
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:00,010
Sometimes not prying into them

542
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:01,600
is a way of showing respect.

543
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:07,080
Yuanzhou, there's something

544
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,070
I want to discuss with you.

545
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,489
Can you take a walk with me?

546
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:13,010
Okay.

547
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:19,520
When do you plan to attack Yong'an Pagoda?

548
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,530
We need a few days to get prepared.

549
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,530
It must be a foolproof plan.

550
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:28,449
Are the odds of getting my brother back great?

551
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,550
No.

552
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:36,750
If you fail to breach the pagoda,

553
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,530
how many people will die?

554
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,480
In the past, for missions like this,

555
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:44,330
I'd usually prepare compensation

556
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:45,889
for more than half of my men.

557
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:48,810
In other words,

558
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,489
Yuan Lu, Shisan,

559
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:53,889
Qian, and Sun Lang,

560
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:56,409
only half of them may come back.

561
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:07,050
Your Highness.

562
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:10,450
If this plan fails,

563
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:12,050
you'll become the most vulnerable.

564
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,810
I've made a deal with Ruyi.

565
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,740
She won't attack the pagoda with us

566
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,810
and will take you to a safe place that day.

567
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,250
If we all…

568
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:30,930
If that should happen,

569
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:32,810
do as she says.

570
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,010
She'll take good care of you.

571
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:41,730
In the past few days,

572
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:43,810
I've been hesitating over something.

573
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,690
But just now,

574
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,070
I finally made up my mind.

575
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:51,650
Mr. Ning.

576
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:55,970
Yes, Your Highness.

577
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:58,810
I order you

578
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,200
to prioritize the safety of the guards of Liudao Hall

579
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:04,050
when you attack Yong'an Pagoda.

580
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,750
As for other things,

581
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:08,950
you can do as you see fit.

582
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:11,920
I mean,

583
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,440
save my brother if you can.

584
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:17,990
If you can't,

585
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:20,450
just force him to write a name clearing edict.

586
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:24,200
I couldn't have made him do it in the pagoda that day.

587
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:25,530
But you can.

588
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:29,050
My brother is narrow-minded and selfish.

589
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,050
Chai Ming and many other guards died for him

590
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,870
but he saw the vindication of them as a deal.

591
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,500
He's the emperor of Wu so you have to save him.

592
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:38,770
But if it's impossible,

593
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,490
it must be the will of God.

594
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:51,370
I can't let more people

595
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,090
throw their lives away for him.

596
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:57,810
Whatever the consequence is,

597
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,460
I'll take it.

598
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:03,180
But can you bear the consequence?

599
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,810
If Prince Danyang blames it on your incompetence,

600
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,290
how can you get off the hook?

601
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:09,650
If my brother couldn't return to Wu,

602
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:11,990
Brother Danyang would surely get the throne

603
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,610
and I could take some credit for it.

604
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,800
Given that he'd take the throne unjustifiably,

605
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,650
if he dared to do anything to me,

606
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:20,340
I'm afraid

607
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:23,330
he wouldn't be on the throne for long.

608
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,850
If worst comes to worst,

609
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,520
I'll just take off this gown.

610
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:33,090
The one in trouble would be Prince Li,

611
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,120
not me, a princess.

612
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,770
I'll do as you say, Your Highness.

613
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:47,770
Ying.

614
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,380
You've really grown up.

615
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:52,400
Now, you think independently

616
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,530
and are broad-minded and clever.

617
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:57,650
I believe

618
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:00,210
if our mothers knew,

619
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,420
they'd be very glad.

620
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,360
Thank you, Yuanzhou.

621
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,510
I'll go do something else.

622
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:27,990
I just bought those pine nuts.

623
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:29,530
You wouldn't send me to death.

624
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:30,630
I should thank you.

625
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,940
Don't you want them?

626
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,780
That's no way to give someone pine nuts.

627
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:41,070
Pull me up.

628
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,290
Hold tight.

629
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,730
Why are you crying?

630
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,140
Boss Ning just praised you, didn't he?

631
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:09,530
Don't mind me.

632
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,170
I just want to cry.

633
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:13,450
Are you missing your mother?

634
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,210
How do you know?

635
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:18,530
I took a guess.

636
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:22,930
Mr. Du and my brother

637
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:25,290
keep saying

638
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,770
I'm getting more and more capable

639
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:30,830
and my father would be proud of me.

640
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:34,530
But I'm also my mother's daughter.

641
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:37,940
Does she not deserve to be remembered

642
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,270
just because of her humble origins?

643
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,530
Only Yuanzhou still remembers her.

644
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,310
And Boss praised you because you're great,

645
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,950
not because you're someone's daughter, right?

646
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:52,050
Here.

647
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:52,730
That's right.

648
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:05,050
What's the candy you eat all the time?

649
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:06,250
Give me one.

650
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:09,810
It's my pill. It's very bitter.

651
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:11,970
Since it's bitter,

652
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:14,170
why do you enjoy eating it?

653
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,850
Because taking pills means I'm still alive.

654
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:19,410
I'm happy to be alive.

655
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,010
Or why did I thank you just now?

656
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:24,710
Are you afraid?

657
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:25,850
Of what?

658
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,590
Death.

659
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,010
Of course I'm afraid.

660
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:32,590
There are so many delicious foods and interesting things

661
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,620
I haven't tried.

662
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,730
Why can't I live a long life?

663
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:39,650
But

664
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:43,690
I don't want Boss Ning to worry about me.

665
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,160
You don't know it.

666
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:48,120
He came to check on me at midnight several times

667
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:51,250
and sighed as he took my pulse.

668
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,090
I don't want him to be sad.

669
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:02,470
So I pretend to be devil-may-care.

670
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:04,730
I've done a good job, haven't I?

671
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,050
Actually, I'm afraid too.

672
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,480
I'm afraid

673
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:18,690
if Yuanzhou failed to save my brother,

674
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:23,200
I'd be held captive by An people

675
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,940
and you guys would abandon me.

676
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:37,730
I'll be kind and let you lean on my shoulder.

677
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:52,810
Don't worry.

678
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,690
I can't live long.

679
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:56,370
I'm not lucky enough to be a princess's husband.

680
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:58,460
Take it back. Take it back.

681
00:41:58,730 --> 00:41:59,890
Don't jinx it.

682
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:01,690
You must not say something like that again.

683
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:14,650
Let me play a song for you.

684
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:29,730
Yuan Lu.

685
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,990
Do you have someone you like?

686
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:36,160
Yes.
