1
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,980
<i>So,</i>
<i>you saw him in the elevator.</i>

2
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,650
And you stole the key from the office
just because you didn't like him?

3
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,694
Hey!

4
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,614
How could you trash his place
just because he ignored you? Huh?

5
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:13,948
Hey!

6
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:18,661
And how can you do this to my face just
for playing with an extinguisher? Huh?

7
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,371
I thought you were his friend.

8
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,373
-Sorry.
-My friend? What?

9
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,625
Take it easy.

10
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,294
-Aah.
-Who you talking about? Huh?

11
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,755
What, with this asshole?
Are you kidding me?

12
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:32,675
I'm not friends with this pathetic loser.
There's no soul in his eyes. Eh?

13
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,887
What about him? You mean he reported me?

14
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,640
Don't be an idiot. He ran away.

15
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,185
Ran away? Why?

16
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,523
That's what I'm asking you.

17
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,899
There's the murderer.

18
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,194
Then the guy who destroyed evidence.

19
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,657
And the runaway.

20
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:01,371
A KILLER PARADOX

21
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,105
Here's the thing.

22
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,526
When people get old and they get sick,

23
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,613
guess what's the first thing
they run out of?

24
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,119
You will run out of any sort of tolerance.

25
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,459
You suddenly can't seem
to tolerate certain things.

26
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,338
Things you easily could in the past.

27
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,219
Aah…

28
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,598
Certain days,

29
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,434
you might

30
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,313
think the world is swarming
with disgusting vermin.

31
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,148
Hmm?

32
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,985
And other days,

33
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,446
you might

34
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:20,033
think you could murder anyone you see…

35
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,913
and it'd be good.

36
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,348
Ah shit. Look at this.

37
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,725
I can't fix this.

38
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,560
I just can't.

39
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,618
LEE TANG
CURRENT LOCATION: UNKNOWN

40
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:09,165
JOONGAM SERVICE AREA

41
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,003
Hmm?

42
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,506
<i>I thought</i>
<i>you would give me a call.</i>

43
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,342
What's the matter?

44
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,511
<i>I'm just… </i>

45
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,305
…frustrated about this whole situation.

46
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,309
Detective Park is saying
to continue to rest,

47
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,894
<i>saying that I'm overzealous.</i>

48
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,438
Right, just cut to the chase already.

49
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,525
<i>I saw on TV</i>
<i>that Ha Sang-min murdered Choi Gyeong-a.</i>

50
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,152
Do I have to learn this
through the news now?

51
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,363
Why haven't you been telling me anything?
I mean--

52
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,742
What, so now it's my job to keep you up
to date with everything that's goin' on?

53
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,912
That's not it. But shouldn't I be
out there doing something?

54
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,623
<i>You said the employee</i>
<i>who ran away was Lee Tang.</i>

55
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:54,377
<i>I think the explosion was also his doing,</i>
<i>and Ha Sang-min's death too.</i>

56
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,462
You have any evidence he did it?

57
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,089
<i>We haven't found any proof.</i>

58
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,634
Ah, come on!
Then who else could it be?

59
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:06,556
Just because you believe that he did it
doesn't mean he actually did. Huh?

60
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,809
Stop lashing out at everyone else
just because you got hurt.

61
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,394
Just give it a rest.

62
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,478
<i>Detective Jang.</i>

63
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,689
<i>I saw that bastard.</i>

64
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:17,608
I'm certain.

65
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,737
I only got a glance at him,
so I didn't know at first.

66
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,322
That's why I didn't tell you.

67
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,908
I think it's the guy you couldn't catch.

68
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,080
How do you even know about him?

69
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,084
Have you been snooping around?

70
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,545
I'm sorry, sir,
but I looked through the files.

71
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,841
Regardless, we know that Roh Bin
and Lee Tang are working together.

72
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,802
<i>We need to do something. Anything.</i>
<i>We could dig into Roh Bin--</i>

73
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,888
Lee Tang or Roh Bin or whoever the hell,

74
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,515
I'll go after them,
so stop whining and stay put.

75
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,434
<i>I mean, I'm not whining right now.</i>

76
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,769
I will catch them.

77
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:55,813
All right.

78
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,779
If you're here to do
your duties as a son, huh,

79
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,114
then take those calls outside.

80
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:10,286
You said that you never
wanted to be like your father.

81
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,621
Now,

82
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:15,458
do you really think that
your behavior is any different than his?

83
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:22,006
His blood pressure and breathing
are back to normal now.

84
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,551
We should keep an eye on him
for a couple of days.

85
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,637
I see. Thank you.

86
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,973
And this is what I told you about.

87
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,562
Take however much time you need to…

88
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,648
to discuss this between the two of you.

89
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:43,027
I hope you can consider his delicate
condition and make a careful decision.

90
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,530
FAMILY'S CONSENT TO WITHDRAW
LIFE-SUSTAINING TREATMENT

91
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:49,450
When he gets put on a ventilator
to begin life-sustaining treatment,

92
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,954
the patient's quality of life
will decrease dramatically.

93
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,667
And when you are ready,

94
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:03,506
you can sign a DNR or DNI on his behalf
to refuse resuscitation or intubation.

95
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,111
Excuse me.

96
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:32,493
Hey, sir?

97
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,371
What are you doing?

98
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:36,831
Huh? What?

99
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,334
Me?

100
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,503
You were groping my leg.

101
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,424
What? What are you talking about?

102
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,926
You just groped my leg.

103
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,678
What are you talking about?

104
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:53,306
-I fell asleep when I got on.
-She said he groped her.

105
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,349
-Wow.
-What are you talking about?

106
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,851
You're being ridiculous.

107
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,980
-You touched my leg under your briefcase!
-I fell asleep as soon as I got on!

108
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,357
Do you have proof? Huh?

109
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,027
Did anyone see me touch her?

110
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,905
Did anyone take a photo? Did you see it?

111
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,157
-Did anyone see it?
-See? Nobody did.

112
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,955
Hey!

113
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,375
-Oh, hello, sir! Hey.
-Look who it is.

114
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,931
Oppa.

115
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,600
Don't you have exams tomorrow?

116
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,977
Oh, yeah.

117
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,480
I gave it some thought, and

118
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:46,359
well, my grades are…

119
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,570
They're beyond saving, so…

120
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,073
so I thought, "Why stress?"

121
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,367
I can retake in summer.

122
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,160
Yeah, I guess…

123
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,455
Huh. Uh…

124
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,126
What's your plan today, then?

125
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,128
Huh?

126
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,091
I said, what are you gonna do?

127
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,511
YOU MUST FACE REALITY TO KNOW WHAT TO DO

128
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,972
<i>If you must face reality</i>
<i>to know what to do,</i>

129
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,266
<i>then I won't do anything.</i>

130
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,104
<i>K.O.!</i>

131
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,232
<i>The best way</i>
<i>to dig your head out of the sand</i>

132
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:31,070
<i>is not by facing reality</i>
<i>but by doing mental gymnastics.</i>

133
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:05,021
Hey, why do you have so much stuff
all packed in this tiny place?

134
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,857
Cameras, listening devices…

135
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,692
Hmm? How many?

136
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:13,112
How did you get in here?

137
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,572
How do you think?

138
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,199
I used the front door.

139
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,452
You told me the passcode.

140
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,960
You've lost weight.

141
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,587
Hey.

142
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,756
You know how it goes.

143
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,343
I go on boats to avoid the crackdown.

144
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:38,512
You keep going in circles.
Bah-bah-bah-bah-bah. Same thing.

145
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,848
Yeah.

146
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:41,807
Weight loss?

147
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,726
That just happens.

148
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,562
We shoulda been there together.

149
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,732
The gas explosion was you?

150
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,737
So do you still play, uh,

151
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,406
heroes these days?

152
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:00,868
Back then…

153
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,790
you used to call <i>me</i>
the hero of this generation.

154
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,541
-Right?
-You're no hero!

155
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,423
Ow!

156
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,678
You know, you're the one
who taught me all this stuff.

157
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:22,264
Hey! You little brat!

158
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,142
I quit because I got fucking tired

159
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,769
of playing along with you.

160
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,985
Anyway, this isn't why I'm here,

161
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,905
but I looked into some stuff
while I was waiting for you.

162
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,741
Yeah, I found some interesting stuff.

163
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,162
The new guy that you got working for you.

164
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,623
Let me meet him.

165
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,459
I'm looking for him,

166
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,670
but he's off the radar.

167
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,766
Hmm.

168
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,979
You're not lying.

169
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,863
Goodness, is this my fault?

170
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,866
Well, he is a funny one.

171
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:26,912
I said hey. I guess maybe I scared him.
He ran off, huh?

172
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,498
Ran away like a little rat. Huh!

173
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,250
Why would he bolt like that?

174
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,544
No way for a man to behave.

175
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,173
All right. Let's do this, then.

176
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,760
You're going to find him in the end, hmm?

177
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,722
When you do,
set up a meeting and let me know.

178
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:48,642
Somewhere we can talk. Somewhere private.

179
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,854
Aaah! Minerva. Minerva Coffee.

180
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,314
Love it there.

181
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:05,117
Oh, and, uh,
let me borrow this book.

182
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,368
CRIME AND PUNISHMENT

183
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,995
Hey, but it's not mine.

184
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:09,872
Hey, hey…

185
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,999
Stop being a weirdo about it.

186
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,295
Who would even lock that away?

187
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,714
A borrowed book in a safe?

188
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,927
Ah, there's this strange stain

189
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,013
in the middle of the book too.

190
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,726
-You're such a little klutz.
-Ow.

191
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,024
<i>Round one. Fight.</i>

192
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,164
<i>K.O… K.O…</i>

193
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,374
<i>K.O…</i>

194
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,668
<i>K.O… K.O…</i>

195
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,003
<i>You lose… You lose…</i>

196
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,636
He's that important? The kid?

197
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,013
<i>Continue?</i>

198
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,890
<i>Nine, eight,</i>

199
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,226
<i>seven, six,</i>

200
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,478
<i>five, four,</i>

201
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,731
<i>three, two, one.</i>

202
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,067
<i>Game over.</i>

203
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,580
What?

204
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,969
-Huh?
-Damn it.

205
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,432
What the hell?

206
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,939
Fuck. Damn it.

207
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,024
Fuck.

208
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,196
Who the hell are you, huh?

209
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,615
I'm a cop, motherfucker.

210
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,369
Why is a cop moving alone?
Something's fishy.

211
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,789
-You son of a bitch.
-Hey, now.

212
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,374
Let me go, you motherfucker!

213
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:14,515
-He says he'll only talk to you. Go on in.
-Yes, sir.

214
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,643
Do we just let him sit there, sir?

215
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,146
Hey. Go ahead.

216
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,065
Ugh, what do we do with him?

217
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,734
What else can we do?
We have to follow procedure.

218
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:31,198
<i>I heard thuds outside my door,</i>
<i>so I went out to see who it was.</i>

219
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,909
<i>The detective was on the ground,</i>

220
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,619
<i>unconscious.</i>

221
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,664
<i>I didn't see who beat him up.</i>

222
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,334
That's the story I told
the other detectives when I came in,

223
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,252
but I--

224
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,586
-Hey.
-Yeah?

225
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,217
Just cut to the chase or I'll kill you.

226
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:55,889
Yeah, that's why I brought you
several of these documents.

227
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,605
I didn't know he was back in Korea.

228
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,860
I thought I'd never hear
from that guy ever again.

229
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,700
It was Song Chon.

230
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,369
He's the one who did that to Detective An.

231
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,620
PERSONAL DETAILS
SONG CHON

232
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,708
<i>He should be somewhere in Seoul.</i>

233
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:26,920
<i>The gas explosion in Busan was</i>
<i>his doing as well.</i>

234
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,005
Where were you?

235
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,424
What the fuck?

236
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,346
Hey!

237
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:37,973
Hey!

238
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,310
Keep your fuckin' eyes open, will you?

239
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,312
You should be on the sidewalk.

240
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,315
-What? You almost ran us over. Asshole.
-<i>Oppa.</i>

241
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,900
-Let it go.
-You must be blind.

242
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,860
-Driving this piece of shit.
-Why bother?

243
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,904
-That's enough.
-I'm not fucking done.

244
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,364
-You piece of shit!
-<i>Oppa, </i>come on.

245
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,078
-Get back to work, fuckhead.
-You're wasting your time, okay?

246
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,537
Let's go.

247
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,756
<i>It's the file I gave you before,</i>
<i>with some updates.</i>

248
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,257
DIRECTOR PARK HYEONG-JIN

249
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:17,888
<i>I've also added the unaccounted-for murder</i>
<i>cases that I told you about earlier.</i>

250
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,021
Haven't we gone through this before?

251
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,691
You came to me a few years ago.

252
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:34,446
You gave me stacks of files saying I'm
the only one who can catch Song Chon.

253
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:35,989
That right?

254
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,867
Well, you're the one who lost him.

255
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,830
I could've caught him before if you'd
brought me everything like now.

256
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,498
Isn't that your forte?

257
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:49,670
Testing people without fully committing,
and jumping ship when it goes south?

258
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,881
Isn't that what you're doing
with Lee Tang?

259
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,594
Tang is different.

260
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,889
And he's got nothing to do with this case.

261
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,769
Aah. Hah!

262
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,650
How is he different?

263
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,072
Listen, I'll explain everything later.

264
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,909
Can you please just help me out this once?

265
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,579
If you do, I swear I'll tell you
everything you wanna know.

266
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,289
You wanna make a deal with me?

267
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,501
That's right.
It's time that you get your revenge.

268
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,839
Who do you think you are, telling
a police detective to get his revenge?

269
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,135
Listen.

270
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,514
I have no intention of working
with a fucking nerd like you. Take this.

271
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,891
Get lost, hmm?

272
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,020
And don't go getting
yourself killed messing around.

273
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,606
You have to lie low.

274
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:52,816
Got it?

275
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:58,739
<i>What's going on?</i>

276
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:05,162
Yong-jae says he saw him
on the day of the gas explosion.

277
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,539
-He might actually be telling the truth.
-Hey.

278
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,541
The captain lost his job
because of that punk.

279
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,668
-That's not my fault.
-And Yong-jae is in a coma.

280
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,086
I know! What do you want me to do?

281
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,214
-You can't get involved with that guy!
-No choice!

282
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,758
My hands are tied with the suspension.
Huh?

283
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,346
You do what you gotta do.

284
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,015
-And I'll do what I gotta do.
-Wait, stop. Nan-gam!

285
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,020
Who's that?

286
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:33,690
The detective who got suspended.
Nan-gam. That's him.

287
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:46,745
You guys

288
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,623
are just like weeds.

289
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,335
Your roots are so deep,

290
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,838
it's impossible
to get rid of you entirely.

291
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,301
In the morning,

292
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,679
everyone is exhausted

293
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,430
and tired.

294
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:09,601
You just had to stand
in the road and chat away, huh?

295
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,479
And disobey traffic laws.

296
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,692
And talk back to elders.

297
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,194
-Huh?
-I'm so sorry.

298
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,988
-That right?
-I'm so sorry.

299
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,240
I'm so sorry, sir.

300
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,621
I guess, if you think about it,

301
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,915
it's not your fault, is it?

302
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,292
Hmm?

303
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,501
When you were little,

304
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,838
your parents didn't scold you
for running around

305
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,049
and causing a commotion in public, huh?

306
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,553
You learned you could get your way
by being obnoxious.

307
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,014
But that's the fast track
to ruining your kid.

308
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,479
Now,

309
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,774
isn't it great to see
what you've been doing wrong?

310
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,446
Eh… I'll let you go.

311
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,114
But you need to promise me

312
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:07,784
that from now on, you're gonna
live the life of a model citizen.

313
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,873
-Thank you. Thank you.
-All right.

314
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,875
Thank you so much.

315
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,420
Do you have a pen?

316
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,257
-Pen. Pen.
-I don't, I'm sorry.

317
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,259
-Ballpoint.
-I don't have one.

318
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,386
Oh no.

319
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:31,266
You're a student. You should be
carrying one around with you.

320
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,102
It's… I'm in art school.

321
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,399
-Oh, that's a bummer.
-What?

322
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:42,986
If you're in art school,
you might draw my face one day.

323
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,029
No, please.

324
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,948
I'm a terrible artist. I really am.

325
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,994
I went to a lousy university
in the countryside.

326
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,789
I'm begging you, don't kill me.

327
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,542
Art schools are expensive.

328
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:01,171
You should be able to draw
if you went to an art school.

329
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,925
<i>Two citizens</i>
<i>who were having a meal at a restaurant</i>

330
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:07,594
<i>performed CPR on a person who collapsed.</i>

331
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,930
<i>-They were able to save a precious life.</i>
-Hmm.

332
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,224
<i>They turned out to be new police recruits.</i>

333

<i>while serving food.</i>

338
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:31,868
<i>They immediately</i>

339
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:35,705
<i>In the urgent situation,</i>

<i>The two officers</i>

343
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,217
<i>joined the police force at the same time,</i>

<i>and they had received</i>
<i>their training together.</i>

345
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,764
<i>Security camera footage went viral online</i>

346
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,809

<i>The man seems taken aback and flees.</i>

351
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,335
<i>The victim's friend chases him,</i>
<i>but he manages to escape.</i>

352
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:26,798
<i>The authorities identified him as Lee,</i>
<i>a criminal wanted for attempted murder.</i>

353
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,927
<i>The victim, Mr. Kim,</i>
<i>died on the way to the hospital.</i>

354
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,221
WANTED CRIMINAL FLEES
AFTER A STABBING RAMPAGE

355
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,475
<i>The police are expanding their search</i>
<i>in order to find Lee, who escaped.</i>

356
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,853
<i>They have made a request</i>
<i>for an arrest warrant…</i>

357
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,782
I CAUSED A SCENE, INSULTED MY ELDERS,
NEGLECTED STUDIES, DID DRUGS - HYUNG JI-SU

358
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,711
FAMILY'S CONSENT TO WITHDRAW
LIFE-SUSTAINING TREATMENT

359
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:07,214
SIGNED: JANG NAN-GAM

360
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,614
Get your rest.

361
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,210
Yeah?

362
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,295
-<i>Detective Jang Nan-gam?</i>
-Yes.

363
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,090
<i>I'm Moon Myeong-jun, the new captain.</i>

364
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,216
<i>Are you home?</i>

365
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:56,805
I heard that you were the one
who knows the most, uh…

366
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,598
…about Song Chon.

367
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,104
-Is that what they said?
-I also heard that it was personal.

368
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,190
It kind of was, I suppose.

369
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:10,277
Hey. It's great to have motivation.

370
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,113
This isn't right.

371
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:17,951
I thought you'd have his case files
glued on every wall of your house in here.

372
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,745
Like in the movies.

373
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:22,914
Sorry to ask you…

374
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,418
is there a reason that you stopped by?

375
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,549
Well, I think…

376
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:35,802
this tip-off,

377
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,347
I find it quite credible, to be honest.

378
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,603
And…

379
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:46,813
this here.

380
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:49,816
This Mapo Station case
was just filed today.

381
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:58,867
I think it's the same MO.
What do you think?

382
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:05,999
It's a possibility.

383
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:11,212
He killed the wrong person
this time, however.

384
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:15,342
<i>You know the famous case</i>
<i>with Gajok Construction, right?</i>

385
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,260
<i>Yes. I do.</i>

386
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,929
<i>It's now called Buyeon Construction.</i>

387
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,641
This is the chairman's granddaughter.

388
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:27,437
And apparently,
a special promotion is on the line

389
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,522
for whoever is able to solve this case.

390
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,402
Detective Jang.

391
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,698
Help me. Help me catch my break.

392
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,911
Come back to work tomorrow.

393
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,580
-Tomorrow?
-Mm-hmm.

394
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:49,334
Besides, we can't just let this monster
wander around at large.

395
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,951

Oh, um…
I, uh, have to take this. I'm sorry.

400
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,966
I'll be right back, okay? I'm sorry.

MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES

402
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,823
Don't worry about the book.

403
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:05,910
There's a plan A, B, C, D.
Don't worry, okay? Look, I've got this.

404
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,080
I'll clean this up.
So you just keep lying low.

405
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,790
<i>Don't change the subject.</i>

406
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,086
What kind of man is this guy?

407
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,588
Uh…

408
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:21,009
Who the hell are you? Come on!

409
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,346
Don't!

410
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,765
Oh God!

411
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:35,857
<i>I thought he was like you at first.</i>

412
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,986
<i>Because he wanted to change the world.</i>

413
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,864
You're exactly what
this world needs right now.

414
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:47,702
So how about we join forces,
and then bring justice to the world?

415
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,726
<i>But I was very, very wrong.</i>

416
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:17,315
<i>So it's my responsibility to fix this.</i>

417
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,611
Let me meet him.

418
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,573
Huh? Really?

419
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,330
The situation's been changed.

00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,252

<i>Well, hi.</i>

427
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:24,591
<i>I heard that</i>
<i>you were interested in meeting me.</i>

428
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,010
<i>Yeah.</i>

429
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:32,515
<i>You're much more courageous</i>
<i>than you look, huh? Ten points for you!</i>

430
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:34,434
<i>Right.</i>

431
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,437
<i>I'm gonna give you some directions.</i>

MINERVA COFFEE SHOP

433
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,690
<i>So listen up, okay?</i>

434
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,860
<i>It's better if we, uh…</i>

435
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:47,405
<i>meet somewhere nicer than a coffee shop.</i>

436
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:48,364
Huh?

439
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,582
-Hey, hey, move.
-Sorry, sorry, sorry.

440
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:02,420
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>
<i>That's the place. That's it. All right.</i>

Hey. Over here.

448
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,359
Help yourself.

449
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,782
So, what do you want?

450
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,660
I thought it'd be nice.

451
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:19,080
We can talk about life now.

452
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,083
We're in the same shoes.

453
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,419
It's not like…

454
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:28,881
…we can talk about things
to anyone else.

455
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,509
It's frustrating, lonely.

456
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:33,803
I understand.

457
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,267
You know,

458
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:42,270
I've been curious about somethin', hmm?

459
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,355
How do you…

460
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,899
how do you pick who dies?

461
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,110
Hmm?

462
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,528
ME

463
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,155
-Turn left here.
-What?

464
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,865
Left on this street! Go now!

465
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,867
Ah, you should've said sooner.

466
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,077
Ah, U-turns are the worst.

467
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,204
Sir, I think
you have to make a U-turn.

468
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,790
-What am I supposed to do?
-Just make a U-turn! There are no cars!

469
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,334
-That's not legal.
-So you follow every fucking law?

470
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:08,254
-Shut it. I'm not doing that.
-Hey, shut up! Will you just shut up?

471
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,673
Just make a left turn up here, all right?

472
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,134
Little bitch.

473
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,347
Wait, maybe that's too big for a start.

474
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,060
Something easier. Hmm.

475
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:26,939
I heard that you… get these hunches,
or something.

476
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:28,775
Wait, what?

477
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,154
Are you normally this quiet?

478
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,658
Answer yes or no.

479
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:43,164
Do you get, you know, tingles?

480
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,042
Something like that? This jolt?

481
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,126
Huh?

482
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:55,927
Is this the right place?

483
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,472
I… I'm pretty sure it is.

484
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:01,474
Get a move on!

485
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:02,934
Hurry!

486
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,144
-Come on, move!
-Hey, hey!

487
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,355
I'm done with your bullshit. Grab him.

488
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,944
Hey, what are you doing?
Why are you doing this?

489
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:17,115
I mean, learn to read the room
before you act out.

490
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,033
Yeah?

491
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,288
You're really getting on my nerves.

492
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,795
Aaah!

493
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:33,506
Hang on. So, it's not like…

494
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:39,345
you have some kind of special,
uh, superpower, huh?

495
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,473
Where, I mean, you somehow know

496
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:46,102
all the evil deeds that a person has done
in their entire life

497
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,478
just by touching them?

498
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,729
'Cause that's insane.

499
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,778
Aah. Oh, come on.

500
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,615
Hey, yeah.

501
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:01,909
This is boring.

502
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:06,164
Huh? Boy, this is anticlimactic.

503
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,003
HAWAII CLUB

504
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,387
Anyway.

505
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,057
Do you have any questions for me?

506
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:28,936
Ask me anything. I'll tell you.

507
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:33,983
Where's my book at?

508
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:38,613
Ah, the one I borrowed?

509
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:42,867
I'm not done with it.

510
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:45,828
Hey.

511
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,664
About Roh Bin, huh?

512
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,126
Don't trust that guy.

513
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:57,131
If you make a single mistake,

514
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,509
he'll abandon you right away.

515
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,013
Look how he was keeping your book.

516
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,267
Ugh.

517
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,479
Do you wanna work together?

518
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:13,689
Hmm?

519
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,651
The problem is, I get confused

520
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,821
when I pick who I might kill.

521
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,908
It keeps getting more and more confusing.

522
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:29,455
I don't care if you mess up, hmm?

523
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,292
There's always collateral damage
for the common good.

524
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,086
Wouldn't you agree?

525
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,802
So much garbage to clean up,

526
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,638
but I don't have much time.

527
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,015
And I'm not as young as I used to be.

528
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,142
Aah!

529
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:53,020
Well, it's… it's getting quite late.

530
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,565
So think it over and let me know.

531
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,444
Don't make me wait too long, though, pal.

532
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:06,450
You know what the issue is, huh?

533
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:11,163
They'll just keep making trouble
if you let them be.

534
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,744
Is this your answer?

535
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,662
Hah.

536
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,789
Oh.

537
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,709
We should always be on alert, right?

538
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:58,711
Most people…

539
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,339
Eh?

540
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,674
Don't know exactly when they'll die.

541
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:08,846
That's the reason
assholes like you can get them.

542
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,014
But me,

543
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,475
I'm not one of them.

544
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,145
Huh.

545
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:18,522
Yeah…

546
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,484
Now you look like
you've come to your senses.

547
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:26,113
You look so pitiful.

548
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,282
Hmm? Know what?

549
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,577
I've given it some thought.

550
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,579
And you just

551
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,123
don't seem to have any sense

552
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,793
of heroism or responsibility.

553
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,421
Aren't you just a murderer, then?

554
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,007
A murderer that…

555
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:47,885
deserves to die.

556
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:52,807
Oh.

557
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:57,436
Fuck. He caught us, you shithead.

558
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,814
I told you to stay quiet.

559
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,816
I'm sorry, sir.
My legs were cramped.

560
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:02,733
Yeah, yeah.

561
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:06,070
Hey! Hey!

562
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,530
We… we're not open.

563
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,907
We're not here to drink.

564
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,661
Then what do you want?

565
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,914
We're here to escort you, sir.

566
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,290
Shall we?

567
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,003
Who's this?

568
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,297
What's with the scrawny kid?

569
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,634
-Do we just let him walk?
-What the hell?

570
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:50,990
Thanks.

571
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,127
Why did you keep the book?

572
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,091
It wasn't because I didn't trust you.

573
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,428
I had this plan.

574
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,431
But he took the book.

575
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,141
I'm sorry.

576
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,602
I failed you.

577
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:29,653
But I still have a plan.
Can you just trust me again?

578
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:38,329
<i>Hyung.</i>

579
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,422
I'm so scared.
