00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,346
<i>My sweet Yeo-ok.</i>

2
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,934
-Oh, God damn, I'm so dizzy.
-Seriously!

3
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,438
-I'm so fucking into that one tall dude!
-It's cold as shit in here.

4
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,233
Seriously, he's so hot.
My fucking God.

5
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:28,028
What the hell are you saying?

6
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,738
-For real…
-Shit, aren't you cold, guys?

7
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,073
God, just sit there
and stop fucking around.

8
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,784
You know, I…

9
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,996
God, what's with her?

10
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:41,416
I asked the tall guy out,

11
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:43,960
but he gave me
the short guy's number instead.

12
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:49,215
But the short guy
is cute as hell too.

13
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,802
He's small and cute.
Makes you wanna, like, hug him.

14
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:56,306
-Yeo-ok, would you listen to me? Fuck.
-No…

15
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,478
-There's fumes. Don't.
-Hey. Shut up, bitch.

16
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,314
Stop nagging me, for fuck's sake.

17
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,565
Hey.

18
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:09,152
Hey! Stop…

19
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,404
Don't fucking light it.

20
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,756
<i>My poor Yeo-ok.</i>

21
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,554
<i>She did nothing wrong.</i>

22
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,102
<i>She was just unlucky.</i>

23
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,440
<i>She just made some bad friends.</i>

24
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,163
<i>That's what my aunt always used to say.</i>

25
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,583
<i>-Well…</i>
-Um…

26
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,044
<i>At least, that's what she believed.</i>

27
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,090
God.

28
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,676
Oh, my head.

29
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,471
Oh, wow.

30
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,265
Honey, don't you smell something?

31
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,350
Come on. Wake up.

32
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,941
What are you…

33
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,360
what are you doing up at this hour?

34
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,903
What's that smell?

35
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,864
Ah shit, Mom.

36
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,241
You just had to ruin everything.

37
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:40,869
Oh, Yeo-ok…

38
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:49,169
<i>The police said</i>
<i>she signed her parents up</i>

39
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:52,213
<i>for eight different</i>
<i>life insurance policies.</i>

40
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,342
Aah.

41
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,637
<i>It wasn't her disability or poverty.</i>

42
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,682
<i>It was her nature and vanity.</i>

43
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:03,850
Oh.

44
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,729
Mm…

45
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:11,858
<i>I know a lot of people have been saying</i>
<i>we should give her our condolences,</i>

46
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,068
<i>since she paid the price with her death,</i>

47
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,029
<i>but I have no intention of doing so.</i>

48
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,117
<i>Death is not something</i>
<i>that should exonerate any sin</i>

49
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,660
<i>if it wasn't repented for.</i>

50
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,248
<i>So, please,</i>
<i>don't give her your condolences.</i>

51
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,753
A KILLER PARADOX

52
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,756
MY COUSIN'S SEON YEO-OK
THE BLIND WOMAN WHO KILLED HER PARENTS

53
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:40,094
STAYING NEUTRAL TILL THIS IS VERIFIED
I HEARD SHE WASN'T QUALIFIED FOR THE DOG

54
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,304
Crazy, right?

55
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,182
I guess karma does exist, huh?

56
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,186
-Hey, Jae-sun.
-Yes?

57
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,230
-Come here a second.
-Why?

58
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,273
There's some detectives here.

59
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,526
Let Ui-seong take care of it
and come with me. Come on. Come on!

60
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,163
Yes. Mm…

61
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:10,208
I'm the one who wrote that post, sir.

62
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:12,794
How come?

63
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:19,050
-Does that make you think I murdered her?
-No, not at all, miss.

64
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:23,763
We just had some questions
regarding your cousin, that's all.

65
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:26,349
The, um… the late Ms. Seon Yeo-ok.

66
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:33,648
-When was the last time you spoke to her?
-We don't… talk at all.

67
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,443
All right, but when did you last see her?

68
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,280
Well, it's been so long,

69
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,407
I really couldn't say.

70
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,368
Could you give a rough estimate?

71
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,453
Like how many years ago it was?

72
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,504
When Yeo-ok was in grade school…

73
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,009
…she poured boiling water on my face.

74
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,972
You know why she did that?

75
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,392
Yeah. I read what you posted.

76
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,936
You touched her things without asking.

77
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,946
No. She just fucking wanted to.

78
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:26,492
Just a reason to try to kill me,
because she's just…

79
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,998
She was smiling when she did it.

80
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:37,253
When she poured that boiling water on me,
she was smiling right at me.

81
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,970
If you were me,
would you want to remember her?

82
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,224
<i>You can get back to work.</i>

83
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,518
-Thanks for your time.
-All right, then.

84
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,354
-Have a safe drive back.
-Thanks.

85
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:59,984
Ah, the service dog we mentioned earlier.

86
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,695
I'll be in contact
if we're able to locate it, okay?

87
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:03,654
No.

88
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,907
It's none of my business.

89
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,950
It's really okay.

90
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,876
-Lord…
-Congratulations on your new life!

91
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,879
-Yeah, man! Congratulations! Hey!
-Hear, hear!

92
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:23,257
-You were pretty lucky there, Chung-jin.
-Ah, wow.

93
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,258
Thank you.

94
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,969
I might as well get struck by lightning
on a clear day, huh?

95
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,596
-My man, Chung-jin.
-Yes.

96
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,973
You finally have a badge of honor.
How do you feel?

97
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,393
-Hey, did it hurt bad?
-Ah… Course it hurt. Jesus.

98
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,854
-This is embarrassing, you guys.
-Hey, come on, tell us.

99
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,232
Well, no one here's
been stabbed before, huh?

100
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,775
I almost died last year.

101
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,694
Nah, you were nowhere near death.
I was way closer.

102
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:47,824
The <i>soju </i>bottle was this big, and then he…
Pfft! Just stabbed me with it.

103
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,701
And you don't even know what's goin' on.

104
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:54,664
The minute he stabbed me, I thought,
"I ought to catch this asshole," but--

105
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,499
-It's true. I turned.
-Wow. That's stupid.

106
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,334
Then I started gushing.

107
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,212
-Here we go again.
-No, the blood was leaking, I swear.

108
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,839
And that's when I knew.

109
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:06,634
"Hey, something isn't right.
Something's wrong. This is bizarre."

110
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:09,637
It felt like the blood from my whole body
was draining out of me.

111
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,347
Pussy.

112
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,933
-Ah, it's not that bad.
-Seriously, guys.

113
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,602
-Ah, you're exaggerating.
-When have you ever gotten knifed?

114
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,646
So who murdered those guys, huh?

115
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,981
No idea.

116
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,400
Ahem. These few days have been hectic.

117
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,193
I know. It's odd.

118
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,114
Uh, anyway, uh…

119
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:31,033
You should go back to the hospital
and think it over.

120
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,202
Don't you think you'll regret it?

121
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:37,331
Hmm. Uh… It's not just this incident, uh…

122
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:40,168
But if I leave it as is,
the doctor says there's a possibility

123
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,752
one day, I'll drop dead.

124
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,672
I'm not cut out to be a detective.

125
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:48,968
And, with the work I've been doing,
I don't wanna go to the night-shift team.

126
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,429
Hey, listen. Every job's the same.

127
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,850
We all carry a resignation letter
in our hearts. Ahem.

128
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,935
Do you even have a job lined up…

129
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,687
Hey, come on in.

130
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,481
-Mm!
-Here you go.

131
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,565
Hey, thanks.

132
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,486
As I was saying…

133
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,362
Got any plans after you quit?

134
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,782
-You know my wife runs a hair salon?
-Mm.

135
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:15,870
And for the last three years, we've been
considering moving abroad somewhere.

136
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,122
Uh, we even put the salon up for sale.

137
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,458
-And I have my severance pay.
-Aah.

138
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,546
I can't rely on my wife to make ends meet,
so I'll teach myself how to make <i>sushi.</i>

139
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,591
I'd go by James Park,
or something like that.

140
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:32,136
Yeah, I've lived away from family.

141
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,848
It's not a great way to live.

142
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:41,270
I should've gone with them
and become Oliver Park instead.

143
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,357
I feel like I can't even talk to my kids.

144
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,401
Ahem.

145
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,824
My baby was a gentle boy!
He's never harmed anyone!

146
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,451
You know nothing about him!

147
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,246
-Will you catch the killer or not?
-Ma'am, you're obstructing justice.

148
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,582
-Oh, really? I'm obstructing it? Huh?
-Calm down, ma'am. No, you're not.

149
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,919
-Did you catch the murderer?
-I'll call later when you're calmer.

150
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,547
-Would you say that if he was your kid?
-Could somebody escort her?

151
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,424
You might as well have killed
my son again with that autopsy!

152
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:13,844
Sir, are you all right?

153
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,305
You try getting slapped. Shit.

154
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,778
Aah.

155
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,119
-Hey, sir?
-Hmm?

156
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,790
Thinking about Detective Park
makes me angry too.

157
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:44,834
And?

158
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:49,005
Don't you think we were too harsh
on that woman in there?

159
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,215
-What do you mean?
-Well, think it through…

160
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,925
Her kid died.

161
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,263
If I were her, I already would've lost it.

162
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,932
They were murdered.
We don't have evidence or witnesses.

163
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,184
That's not true.
We just haven't found any yet.

164
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,186
There's no murder without evidence.

165
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,731
It's just… that's not
what this is about, sir.

166
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:10,526
I'm sorry.

167
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:15,781
Hey…

168
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,704
Victims can also be victimizers.

169
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,164
Mm?

170
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,666
Know what I'm saying?

171
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,131
I worked on a case
at the Dunsan Police Station.

172
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,187
<i>Her name was Kang Yeon-seo.</i>

173
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,147
-What?
<i>-I still can't forget about it.</i>

174
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,691
-What's that?
-I'm drawing your eyebrows.

175
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,527
Can you please just wear makeup?

176
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,822
-I'll try. Fine.
-You look so good with it.

177
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,949
-Huh?
-Hey, that's him.

178
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,079
He looked better in the picture.

179
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,872
This'll look good on him, right?

180
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,586
-What's wrong with her?
-I don't know. She has a crush.

181
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,380
She said he was hot, but he isn't.

182
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,091
What? You didn't have to.

183
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,759
-What?
-How are you?

184
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,135
-Good.
-What's in there?

185
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,221
-What are you doing?
-Hanging out.

186
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,306
-What is it?
-Relax! It's mine!

187
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,974
-I'm not done yet.
-Those your friends?

188
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,184
-Yeah.
-What is it?

189
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,019
-No classes?
-Let me see.

190
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,521
Dude, chill. It's mine.

191
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:29,772
One, two, three!

192
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,191
Honey, let me get a bigger smile.

193
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,568
-One, two…
-Come on, if you're done.

194
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,904
-A happier one.
-Do I look good?

195
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,406
-Want to see?
-Let me!

196
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,324
-Hold on, dumbass.
-Come on.

197
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,909
-Hold the fuck on.
-Hurry up!

198
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:45,037
-You just don't know how to wait.
-Hurry, dude!

199
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,790
-So? How was it? Huge tits, right?
-For fuck's sake.

200
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,583
-Her legs are fucking bomb.
-Big, right?

201
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,502
-Holy shit.
-Let's get the fuck out.

202
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,629
-We gotta run.
-I wanna fuck her once more.

203
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,797
Let's go!

204
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,179
Okay.

205
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,864
<i>A month after she was raped,</i>

206
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,575
<i>she took her own life.</i>

207
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,419
-No, you can come by later.
-I just want to talk to him.

208
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,420
KANG YEON-SEO

209
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,840
-You can do that another time.
-Sir! Can I talk to you?

210
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,802
-This is a funeral, so please…
-We have two different stories.

211
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,471
-Sir!
-We can talk at the station.

212
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,765
It's very strange
you keep avoiding me.

213
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,434
-Please, ma'am.
-You never know if it was consensual!

214
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,686
-You don't know!
-You're out of your mind, woman!

215
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,646
Why raise your voice?

216
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,356
What the hell is wrong with you?

217
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,859
What makes you think
you can attack us like this?

218
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,612
-Do you have no conscience?
-How dare you talk to me like that?

219
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,114
-Let's talk outside, ma'am.
-What exactly are you implying?

220
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,741
-Sorry, everyone.
-Everyone.

221
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,076
-Don't just listen to what you've heard.
<i>-Ajumma!</i>

222
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,162
-You can't!
-They're kids, but men and women…

223
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,914
-Anything can happen!
-What? What?

224
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,499
-You tell the cops what?
-Say it again.

225
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,083
-What the fuck did you say?
-Stop it!

226
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,629
-I'm not gonna take this from you!
-What did you say? She came onto him?

227
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,173
-These things can happen!
-You're a bunch of losers.

228
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,133
-How fucking dare you?
-Looking to make a buck--

229
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,803
God damn it! Idiot!

230
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,471
-Something's wrong with you.
-You bastard!

231
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,723
<i>This bitch</i>
<i>came to the girl's funeral</i>

232
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,476
<i>and was accusing the parents</i>
<i>of all sorts of bullshit.</i>

233
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,770
-Not fair!
-<i>It was that woman we saw earlier.</i>

234
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,063
-Not now! Go!
-<i>Hmm.</i>

235
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,648
-This is all crap!
<i>-Someone died.</i>

236
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,318
<i>But her son got off easy</i>
<i>because he was a minor.</i>

237
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,488
That wasn't the end of it.

238
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:47,326
Those assholes kept on committing
assault, burglary, you name it.

239
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,456
I can't say I know
exactly how her parents feel,

240
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,461
but I know, to them,
those assholes aren't victims at all, hmm?

241
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,172
I would've killed them myself already
if I were them.

242
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,343
People aren't just victims or assailants.

243
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,846
They're all people. That's it.

244
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,307
You think we should go
and visit the girl's parents?

245
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:11,976
Why?

246
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:17,106
-They might be the--
-Hey. Were you not at the crime scene?

247
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,901
Huh? Did it look
like a premeditated revenge murder?

248
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,486
It was spontaneous, huh?

249
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,197
Still, though, you never know, and…

250
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,621
Mm…

251
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,498
Yeah, yeah, it was her.

252
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,458
That's her, all right. Yeah, yeah.

253
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,918
She was standing out there.

254
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,837
She was just standing still
and looking around.

255
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,089
Yeesh. I thought she was a ghost.

256
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:45,342
But then, she didn't come inside the store
or anything, but…

257
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,595
-She just kept looking--
-What time was that?

258
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:53,309
The night shift was just about to start,
so it was around 10:00 p.m. Ten, yeah.

259
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,771
-You got cameras, right?
-Of course we do.

260
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,440
Look, right over there. Look.

261
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:02,443
I decided to make an investment
and replaced them with new ones.

262
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,028
The video quality's great.

263
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:08,198
Although that good quality
also means the files are bigger.

264
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,367
-And it stores--
-So you don't have it?

265
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:14,830
Well, we have something.
Just nothing older than five days.

266
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,916
We have yesterday's. I can get you that.

267
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,543
Hmm…

268
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,757
What about what's-his-face? Uh…

269
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,716
Who?

270
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,718
Oh, yeah, Lee Tang.

271
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,929
How is he doing these days?

272
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,097
Oh my God, don't even get me started.

273
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,516
Just hearing that asshole's name
gets me angry.

274
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,561
Just, how could he stab me in the back?

275
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,898
My door, the door here,
it doesn't even make the sounds anymore.

276
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,483
He broke this, too, right?

277
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,526
-Yeah.
-What, was he trying to piss me off?

278
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,028
I mean, come on.

279
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,822
I paid him in advance, and he just left.

280
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,033
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

281
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,619
I can't believe that little shit.

282
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,412
Hold on.

283
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,916
Actually, I think he saw her as well, sir.
That lady.

284
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:03,128
Um, w-well, does that help you at all?

If it isn't Detective Jang,

<i>Why'd you leave so early?</i>

303
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,414
I, uh, got some more things to do

304
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,331
<i>at the hospital.</i>

305
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,834
<i>You didn't even call when I was in there.</i>

306
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,711
<i>So, what's up?</i>

307
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,671
You were only there for two days.

308
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,174
That's just a long doctor's visit.

309
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,925
Huh? Hey.

310
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,094
I just heard you quit.

311
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,389
You can't quit
before you catch the killer.

312
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,059
I found somethin' strange
about Seon Yeo-ok's case.

313
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,269
Mm. But there's still a lot more to do.

314
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,521
Jesus, man, is work
all you ever talk about?

315
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,190
God, you really are a robot.

316
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,943
If the killer just happens
to fall out of thin air,

317
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,612
I'll think about it, okay?

318
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:54,031
<i>Nothin's gonna fall out of thin air</i>
<i>if you just stay home.</i>

319
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,657
<i>You have to at least do somethin'.</i>

320
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,494
Whatever, I'm hangin' up.
I have to spend time with my family.

321
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,163
<i>Yeah, well,</i>
<i>I'm sure they don't even want you there.</i>

322
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,624
Hey.
Drink lots of water, buddy<i>.</i>

323
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:06,043
You don't wanna get
kidney stones, all right?

324
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,461
Think about your health.

325
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:10,297
-Not the damn killer, okay?
<i>-Stop changing the subject and--</i>

326
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:15,302
-You came home dressed like that?
-I wasn't out that long.

327
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,347
Shouldn't Dong-u be home
from school about now?

328
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:22,601
-Oh, he went out for a bike ride.
-Ow! Jesus.

329
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:25,354
-Hey, stop throwing things around. God.
-Ow, shit.

330
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,523
-Jeez.
-Since when does he have a bike?

331
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,566
Oh, didn't Nan-gam tell you?

332
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,569
He sent it to him
as an early birthday present.

333
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,030
-Nan-gam did, really?
-Yeah.

334
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,075
Call him and say thanks.

335
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:41,745
Uh… why didn't he say
anything to me about that?

336
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,539
That punk-ass. Jesus.

YOU ARE BEING SUED
FOR FINANCIAL FRAUD BY MR. JUNG GANG-HYO

339
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,138
Ah, shit.

340
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,432
-Well, he got charged for fraud.
-Mm.

341
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,726
But he's just a part-timer
over there.

342
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:05,727
That's right.

343
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,730
So, uh, I just told the guy
to file a civil suit,

344
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,399
but then he was quite adamant,

345
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:14,153
saying I was legally required
to process the case.

346
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,363
So I didn't really have a choice.

347
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,076
So I was gonna
try to help them settle.

348
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,995
The only problem with that, though…

349
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,831
-The kid's gone off the radar.
-Do you have his address?

350
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:26,957
Let's see…

351
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,750
Address. Just a minute.

352
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,712
-Mm…
-Hmm.

353
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:35,299
I've sent the attendance request.
That was… When was that?

354
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,719
Yeah, he should've received it today.

355
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,722
-So… What, do you know him?
-Yeah.

356
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,767
If you're able to reach him,
please just let me know.

357
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:46,810
Sure.

358
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,108
Let me know
if you can't reach him as well.

359
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,528
-Sure. I'll let you know.
-All right. Thank you.

360
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,657
<i>Turn left on this street.</i>

361
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,830
<i>You have arrived at your destination.</i>

362
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,332
<i>Ending navigation.</i>

363
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,857
I should've moved a long time ago.

364
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:39,863
She hated having her own picture taken,
but she loved taking pictures of others.

365
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,908
She took pictures
of everyone in her class.

366
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,410
-All of 'em.
-May I look at this?

367
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,828
-That okay?
-Yeah, please.

368
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:54,586
I remember once, I told her
that she should become a photographer.

369
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,090
But she said
she wanted a nine-to-five job.

370
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,842
She wanted to work for some company

371
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,387
and do it as a hobby, so…

372
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,933
And she never really stood out, you know?

373
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,602
She always kept a low profile.

374
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,690
And I'm not saying this
just 'cause I'm her dad.

375
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,109
She was so kindhearted,

376
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,112
and generous too.

377
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,450
And that's why I decided to murder them.

378
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,705
Huh?

379
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,540
I said I killed them.

380
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,545
I'm the one who murdered.

381
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,006
I killed them.

382
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:40,924
Uh… I killed them.

383
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,302
I killed them.

384
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,763
<i>This is Detective Lee Chang-taek,</i>
<i>Detective Section.</i>

385
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,725
Hi. Hi, uh…

386
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,727
I wanna turn myself in.

387
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,895
<i>You want to turn yourself in?</i>

388
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,982
<i>Uh… what's your name, sir?</i>

389
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,861
L-- Lee Tang.

390
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,280
Oh, Mr. Lee Tang. Hold on.

391
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,284
Okay, uh…

392
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,830
Uh… I guess you received
the attendance request, huh?

393
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,125
This is about you going off the radar
after receiving advance payment

394
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,376
from Mr. Jung Gang-hyo

395
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,170
<i>of OS25 convenience store.</i>

396
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,422
<i>You're under investigation</i>
<i>for that charge.</i>

397
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:23,842
<i>Come to the Detective Section</i>
<i>at the station on the requested date.</i>

398
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:25,635
Actually,

399
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,763
do you think I could come today?

400
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:28,722
<i>Today?</i>

401
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,475
Well, just one minute.

402
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,479
Not seven.

403
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,980
Not eight.

404
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,815
Would 9:00 p.m. be all right?

405
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,234
Yeah.

406
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,325
CONVENIENCE STORE

407
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:49,368
MOM

408
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,940
<i>So you hit them</i>
<i>with a brick?</i>

409
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:24,027
<i>-But don't remember what you did with it?</i>
-<i>No.</i>

410
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:28,782
<i>The two victims were</i>
<i>healthy teenagers, sir.</i>

411
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:34,371
<i>What, uh, gave you the confidence</i>
<i>that you could take them both on?</i>

412
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,375
<i>They were…</i>

413
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,878
<i>wasted and couldn't even walk straight.</i>

414
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,840
So I thought it was my chance.

415
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,761
And how did you know that they were drunk?

416
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:54,182
Well, they were…
nearly unconscious, swaying around.

417
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,701
I'm sorry for going off
on my own like that.

418
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,538
You decided to bring him in, then?

419
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:20,375
You mentioned his probation earlier,
and so, um…

420
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,712
So I looked into it, and his probation
ended the day before the incident.

421
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,339
I thought he might have
been connected to the case,

422
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,675
so I went to go pay him a visit
at his place.

423
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:34,139
It was all thanks to your guidance, sir.
I appreciate it.

424
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,228
Ah, the boss helped out with all the rest.

425
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,065
Seriously, though,
I was so nervous earlier.

426
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,818
But fortunately,
he confessed to everything.

427
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,237
And it matches the circumstan--

428
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,622
<i>Here you go, sir.</i>

429
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,501
<i>You can take your time and fill it out.</i>

430
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,140
Sir, if you'd like to take a minute,
how about a smoke before we do this?

431
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,352
I quit a long time ago.

432
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,567
So, why did you lie to us?

433
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,488
Uh, what?

434
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,283
You didn't kill them, did you?

435
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:38,078
I don't know
what you're talking about.

436
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:40,914
<i>Yeah, I'm sure you don't know,</i>
<i>since you didn't kill them,</i>

437
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,210
<i>but one of the victims</i>
<i>had a cigarette burn on his face.</i>

438
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,253
<i>And one more thing.</i>

439
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,758
You're not right-handed, either.

440
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,429
With me.

441
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,776
-What?
-Hey, why would you go in there alone?

442
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,820
-What the hell are you doing?
-Interrogating him.

443
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,030
You guys went rogue.
Now a man's under arrest.

444
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,198
What should I do?

445
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,951
His statement just doesn't add up.
None of it makes sense.

446
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,202
There's no evidence, either.

447
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,580
-How is a confession enough?
-What do you mean, no evidence?

448
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,832
-There's the brick. He knew about that.
-Come on!

449
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,041
He has motive.

450
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:28,628
Let's say he confesses and tells you
he threw the brick into the Geum river.

451
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:32,424
Are you gonna search the bottom
of the river for it? No, right? Mm?

452
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,802
We don't know if he's an abettor,
accomplice, or witness.

453
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:38,054
So, let's take our time
and figure that out.

454
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:42,392
We'll all be fucked if the real culprit
shows up. That's why I'm doing this.

455
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:45,520
-You should have talked to me in private.
-I was just…

456
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,356
-I'm sorry for being rash.
-You think you're so clever.

457
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,193
But do you honestly think he's telling us
the truth about his involvement?

458
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,780
More than likely, he's covering up
something. We need to find out what.

459
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,490
-And you believe that?
-Yes, sir.

460
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,119
All right then, smart-ass.

461
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,581
You think you're so damn clever,
don't you?

462
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,375
If this goes wrong, it's on you.

463
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,975
GOT IN TOUCH WITH THE PART-TIMER
HE'S COMING IN AT 9:00 P. M.

464
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,435
I'm sorry, sir.

465
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,812
I told you to stay in your lane, Yong-jae.

466
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:30,982
Didn't I?

467
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:36,863
You can go home now.

468
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,081
What, is your ego damaged?

469
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,793
That's not it, sir.

470
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,088
I have something to tell you.

471
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,173
What?

472
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:58,385
I contacted the victims' mothers
to let them know we had a suspect.

473
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,469
Which victim?

474
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,721
The dead high schoolers.

475
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,433
Kang Sang-muk?

476
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,519
Did you send him home?

477
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,729
He's already been released.

478
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,402
There won't be a problem, right?

479
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,576
<i>-Let's play, come on.</i>
-<i>Play what?</i>

480
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,578
<i>What do you want?</i>

481
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,790
<i>-Mm, tag!</i>
-<i>Tag? Again?</i>

482
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,583
<i>Really?</i>

483
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:31,918
<i>Yeah?</i>

484
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:13,042
Damn. You've got my respect.
You're gangster, bro.

485
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,127
My ass, idiot.

486
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,045
I can't believe
you stabbed that cop.

487
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,673
He was pissing me off.
The fuck was I supposed to do?

488
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,092
You hit a guy
with a fire extinguisher that time.

489
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,719
Insane.

490
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:25,346
Fuck's sake, I don't talk
about that. It was an accident.

491
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,390
The fire extinguisher just fell on him…

492
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:37,275
I said he was getting on
my fucking nerves. I had to do something.

493
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,777
Why'd you do it?

494
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,446
JUST DO AS YOU PRACTICED
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THE REST

495
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,033
Shut the fuck up, dude.
You're such a dumbass.

496
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:46,993
You're the dumbass.

497
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,412
Whatever.

498
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:52,248
Seriously, bro…
use your fucking head.

499
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:55,126
Shit, will you stop
fucking giving me shit? Fuck, bro.

500
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,795
I'm gonna stab you, fucker.

501
00:29:56,878 --> 00:30:00,423
-Right. Like to see you try.
-I'll cut your nuts off, bitch.

502
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,130
Are you okay? Sir!

503
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,258
-Wake up!
-Ah, shit.

504
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,801
-Call an ambulance!
-Oh, God.

505
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,094
He needs help!

506
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,556
Sir, wake up.

507
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,516
-Can you hear me?
-Open the door!

508
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,101
-He conscious?
-Wake up!

509
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,936
-Open it.
-A man hit by a car.

510
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,855
-Come quick.
-His eyes are opening.

511
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,523
-Sir, are you okay?
-He's up.

512
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:01,568
-They hit him with a car?
-Ma'am. Open the door.

513
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,488
<i>…and press confirm.</i>

514
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,702
<i>Please insert your bills.</i>

515
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,205
CONVENIENCE STORE

516
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,498
MOM

517
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:27,010
<i>Please insert your bills</i>
<i>and press confirm.</i>

518
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:38,187
<i>Thank you for using our services.</i>

519
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,953
Oh, my God! What--

520
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:02,128
Are you okay? Call 911.

521
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,221
Ugh.

522
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,020
What the fuck is this?

523
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:20,980
What? Let me see.

524
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,027
There's money.

525
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:30,823
What about the rest?

526
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,201
Just throw it away. What else?

527
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:34,661
Let's go!

528
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,012
You were robbed by a snatch thief?

529
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,931
-That correct?
-Yeah.

530
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,685
Can't believe
that still happens these days.

531
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:05,608
Exactly.

532
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:11,447
Son of a bitch, man.
What are the odds, huh?

533
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,250
Hey, watch your head, sir.

534
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:31,467
Just press the call button if you need
assistance with anything.

535
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,552
-Okay?
-Okay.

536
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,315
We should have seen you out
earlier at the station.

537
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,699
I guess all parents are the same.

538
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,119
Well, from what I can tell.

539
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,496
What are you trying to say?

540
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:05,126
There must be a reason
you're going to these lengths.

541
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,175
Is it that you know the killer?

542
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,011
I'm the killer.

543
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:19,682
It's not revenge
if it's a crime you didn't commit.

544
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,017
It wasn't revenge.

545
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,270
I murdered them 'cause they had it coming.

546
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,190
Those bastards.

547
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:28,691
They got what they deserved.

548
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:32,403
It felt great, like a weight was lifted.

549
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,491
-Those assholes deserved to die.
-Sir.

550
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,162
I understand that sometimes,

551
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:44,040
things happen that can make
you want to murder somebody.

552
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:46,626
But the punishment isn't yours to give

553
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:49,629
and should be carried out
within the boundaries of the law.

554
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,090
That's my opinion.

555
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,344
I'll come by tomorrow.

556
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,110
Let's try moving your arm.

557
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:13,986
Is that okay?

558
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,781
-Yeah.
-Hold it in place for a moment.

559
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,116
I'll tape it up for you.

560
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,368
-It's stuffy in there, isn't it?
-It's okay.

561
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:24,789
-Uh, I think I can go alone now.
-Yeah? You can manage on your own?

562
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:27,583
-Yes. I appreciate it.
-I'll see you soon, then.

563
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,210
-Thanks.
-…<i>to Radiology.</i>

564
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,754
<i>Dr. Ha-yoon to Radiology.</i>

565
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:51,816
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT,
I WILL RESPECT YOUR DECISION.

566
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,401
AUTO-DELETE TIMER SET TO 3 SECONDS.

567
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,204
Excuse me.

568
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,277
Hey, are you okay?

569
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,738
You can't be here. Get outta here.

570
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:21,948
-What?
-Listen.

571
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:23,824
The police are here now.

572
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,868
You need to leave, fast. Hurry.

573
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,998
-You know me?
-Shut up!

574
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,166
Go now.

575
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:35,336
-You know me, huh?
-Hurry up and go.

576
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:40,007
Are you that guy from Telegram?

577
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,760
I have a lot to explain. Check Telegram.

578
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,470
-Okay?
-Um, wait, you are.

579
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:47,974
-You're the one who took me home.
-There are too many eyes on us here.

580
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,518
-Please, just go. Please get outta here.
-Sir.

581
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:52,895
I don't care what happens anymore.

582
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:53,938
I swear.

583
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:57,650
But why did you do it? Have you been
following me around all this time?

584
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,694
-No. You need to go.
-Wait!

585
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,863
-You sent those guys on the motorcycle?
-Wh-what do you mean?

586
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,532
No. No, no, no, that wasn't me.

587
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:08,577
Anyway, there's so many things
that I need to tell you about.

588
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,414
You'll learn everything on Telegram.
Leave now.

589
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,374
Go!

590
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,794
Thank you so much.

591
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,922
Sure.

592
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,347
Oh!

593
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,557
Oh! Oh, sir!

594
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,310
-Oh, God.
-Are you okay?

595
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,394
Yeah, yeah.

596
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,150
-I'm sorry.
-Jesus, you didn't do anything wrong.

597
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,192
Stop saying that.

598
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,112
You're just a newbie, all right?

599
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:56,292
And it's not like
your reasoning was totally wrong either.

600
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,755
You were just trying your best
to catch the killer, that's all.

601
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,259
Try not to stress out too much, okay?

602
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,235
Where you going?

603
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,495
-Hello?
-<i>Hey, did Lee Tang come in today?</i>

604
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,455
-No, he hasn't come yet.
-He hasn't?

605
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,624
<i>-I'll wait a little longer.</i>
-Okay, thanks.

606
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:40,419
<i>Tell me. What did you do wrong?</i>

607
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:41,587
<i>I…</i>

608
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,384
<i>Tell me.</i>

609
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,135
-<i>Dad.</i>
-<i>I didn't…</i>

610
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,429
-It's so loud.
-<i>You didn't what?</i>

611
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,766
-Lower the volume or turn it off.
-Okay. I'm sorry, Yeon-seo.

612
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,267
You're still up?

613
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,437
And you should quit smoking too.

614
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,022
Look at your face.

615
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:03,526
Okay. I'll make sure to quit, I promise.

616
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,277
Do you want something to eat?

617
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,030
-Hmm?
-You still need those pills, Dad?

618
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,490
Uh…

619
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,951
Oh, no, I'm… I'm doing okay.

620
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,952
Damn it! You motherfucker.

621
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,624
Ah, fucking…

622
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,210
You piece of shit!

623
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,713
You fucking asshole,
you piece of shit!

624
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,216
Come here, you son of a bitch!

625
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:51,759
Fuck.

626
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,650
Shit…

627
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,695
Get over here, you little bitch.

628
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:16,951
Motherfucker!

629
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:30,965
You fucker!

630
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,760
Fucking son of a bitch!

631
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:43,852
You motherfucker!

632
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,859
-Yeah, who's this?
-<i>Detective.</i>

633
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,944
<i>I'm the nurse in charge</i>
<i>of Mr. Kang Sang-muk.</i>

634
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,571
-Kang Sang-muk?
<i>-Yes.</i>

635
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:38,115
<i>-I think you should hurry over here.</i>
-Huh?

636
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:53,130
The treatment room is this way, over here.

637
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:55,799
We have to do a blood test
to check his liver and heart.

638
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,343
Checking vitals.

639
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,637
-How's it looking?
-130 over 90.

640
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,555
Come on, let's hurry.

641
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,140
Sir, please wake up.

642
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,768
Sir. Sir, can you hear me?

643
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:09,104
-Code red.
-Come on, sir, hang on.

644
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:15,986

Hero.

648

Lee Tang!

649
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:02,032
You don't wanna bother
the neighbors. Not so loud.

650
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,826
I know you're in there. Come on.

651
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:08,747
I won't get angry, so please let us in.
Mom's here too.

652
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:18,006
-There you go. Go ahead.
-Thank you, sir.

653
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,304
Oh my gosh, Yeong…

654
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,849
Would you look at this?

655
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:29,226
Oh my lord. This place…

656
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,562
Oh…

657
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:32,938
Oh…

658
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:35,941
What's this say?

659
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:38,819
Mom, we should call
Gyeong-hwan again.

660
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,405
Read this for me.
It looks like he left a letter.

661
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:45,534
"Dear Mom and Dad."

662
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:52,124
You know which floor she jumped from?

663
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,251
It was the sixth floor.

664
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,588
She jumped from there…

665
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,216
but didn't die right away.

666
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,846
We got her… to the hospital.

667
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,766
And then she suffered

668
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,435
16 hours, till she died.

669
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,353
And it's…

670
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:14,897
it's all my…

671
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,275
it's all my fault.

672
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:24,323
Yeon-seo died unavenged, and in anguish.

673
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,452
I was a terrible father to her, as well.

674
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:35,334
But…

675
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:38,045
Why am I telling you this? We just met.

676
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,352
Those bastards…

677
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,981
they raped my daughter.

678
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,443
I wish I could kill them.

679
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:03,445
If I could, I would.

680
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:06,782
But now

681
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:09,034
there's nothing I can do.

682
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:10,536
Sir.

683
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,579
I'm sorry to interrupt.
