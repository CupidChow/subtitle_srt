1
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,306
Flowers for you?

2
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,516
Buy some flowers?

3
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:22,313
-Ugh, why the hell did you drink so much?
-Let go! Get away!

4
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:26,359
Wow. What a great night.

5
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,695
-Thanks, that was great.
-Thank you, sir!

6
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,990
-Let's go for round three! On me!
-Aah…

7
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,075
-Let's get out of here.
-Round three? No, no.

8
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,660
-I know a great place.
-Listen.

9
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,954
-They do a great pork belly.
-I can't. I gotta go home.

10
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,956
-Take this. You do round three.
-I'm telling you.

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,208
-There. Go!
-A round of applause, everyone!

12
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,295
-You don't have to pay. Come on.
-All right…

13
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,338
-Have you researched being a good boss?
-Huh?

14
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,923
-I get it!
-He's already a good boss.

15
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,675
-No need to look that up.
-No, it's nothing.

16
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,927
-How are you getting home?
-I called a driver.

17
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,721
-Let me walk you to your car.
-Get home safe.

18
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,431
-Don't ask what we spend this on!
-Bye!

19
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:58,516
-Get home safe, sir.
-All right, see you.

20
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:15,450
Ah. Going to Noeun-dong?

21
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,331
This is my car. Come on, let's go.

22
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:49,567
Hello?

23
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,153
<i>Hello? You called a driver</i>
<i>for Noeun-dong, right?</i>

24
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,780
<i>-Where are you?</i>
-Driver?

25
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,324
<i>-I'm here, but I don't see anyone.</i>
-I'm already on my way.

26
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,701
<i>Sorry? But I just got here.</i>

27
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:00,620
What?

28
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,540
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

29
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,292
Hey, driver.
We're heading to Noeun-dong, right?

30
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,046
Oh…

31
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:13,424
Ugh. Hey, I think
we're headed the wrong way.

32
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,011
Hey. Excuse me, where are we going?

33
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:19,931
Driver?

34
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,109
A KILLER PARADOX

35
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,458
Excuse me.

36
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,043
Welcome.

37
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,921
-Hi.
-Hi, uh… how can I help you?

38
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,090
Uh, I was wondering

39
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:58,052
if you have someone who works here
named Lee Tang.

40
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,013
Oh… Lee Tang?

41
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,891
Uh, it… I mean, the name's unusual.

42
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,351
There's a long A in Tang,
you know, like in Nan.

43
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,477
Oh, yeah, yeah.

44
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,271
He used to work here.

45
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,231
He used to?

46
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,859
Yeah, until a few days ago.

47
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,153
VICTIM'S DETAILS

48
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,238
So

49
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:21,284
his family repaid
the 950,000 won on his behalf?

50
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,285
Yes.

51
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,078
Well, that's everything.

52
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,830
-Hmm?
-You can go now.

53
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:26,915
Oh.

54
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,292
-So we're done?
-Yes. All done.

55
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,711
THE PLAINTIFF HAS WITHDRAWN THE COMPLAINT

56
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:55,318
I'm leaving now.
I wish you all the best.

57
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,780
Hey, Mr. James Park,
come visit sometime.

58
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,615
-I'll buy you a steak.
-Yeah.

59
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,700
All right, get going.

60
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:06,246
-Have a safe flight.
-All right.

61
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,664
-Goodbye, sir.
-Goodbye, sir!

62
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,831
-Take care!
-Good luck!

63
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,504
Hmm.

64
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,507
The important thing here is that…

65
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,591
Hey.

66
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,135
She's much prettier in person.

67
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,471
Yeah? So what?

68
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,099
How's that gonna help us out?

69
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,435
-It probably won't hurt.
-Whatever. Stop staring at her.

70
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:32,855
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS UNIT

71
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,317
A close examination of the evidence
will tell us what we've missed.

72
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,069
Let's go over it again slowly.

73
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,281
<i>Now we have</i>
<i>a special investigations unit,</i>

74
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,158
<i>it's only a matter of time</i>
<i>before we find the killer.</i>

75
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,702
<i>Or so we thought.</i>

76
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,329
<i>But all we did was waste time.</i>

77
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,165
4 MONTHS LATER

78
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,710
<i>We have nothing to show</i>
<i>for the last four months.</i>

79
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,093
We're back to square one.

80
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,348
I mean, we haven't
solved a single thing yet.

81
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,350
Isn't it too early to demobilize the unit?

82
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,435
Hey.

83
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,562
They won't be here anymore.

84
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,315
They're doing us a favor.

85
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:20,153
They've been here since before me.
I bet they're itching to go.

86
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,322
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE
CAUSE OF DEATH: UNKNOWN

87
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,032
I've got other cases to work on.

88
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,576
Other cases.

89
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,661
We've still got more than we can handle.

90
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,123
Oh, we miss you, James Park.

91
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,045
Be careful, I don't want
these documents to get out of order.

92
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,714
What did I say?
Pack it so it doesn't fall.

93
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,215
-Huh.
-I don't get it.

94
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,217
They should just hand the case over to us.

95
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,720
What do they expect us to do
after all this time?

96
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,766
Do you think they were really
brought here to bring in bad guys?

97
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,267
Hmm?

98
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,771
Those four months were just to prove
they could keep themselves busy.

99
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,689
It was just a formality, that's all.

100
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,026
-Just a show.
-Right, just a show.

101
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,029
-They just had to show--
-Excuse me.

102
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:08,368
So all this while, Detective Jang, you
thought we were just putting on a show?

103
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:15,375
Well, we're leaving anyway,
so I'll just be honest with you.

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,920
It's a profiler's job to get
an investigation back on track

105
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,630
when it's falling off the rails.

106
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,842
The cases you showed me
in private aren't serial murders.

107
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,804
You're looking at a bunch
of coincidences, I'm positive.

108
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,181
-If no proof of murder--
-Wait.

109
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,893
So, you've been treating these
as coincidences this whole time?

110
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,647
If there is no proof, we follow
the circumstances before our instincts,

111
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,689
as you know.

112
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,609
Especially in Mr. Kang Sang-muk's case.

113
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:45,238
His statements about the, uh, date
of the crime, as well as the motive…

114
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:49,075
-They fit the circumstances at hand.
-And how do they fit, exactly?

115
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,954
You searched the mountains and streams
for four months

116
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,455
but never found that brick.

117
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,959
What suspect forgets
what he did with the murder weapon?

118
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:01,421
The extreme shock from the situation may
have led him to forget important details--

119
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,966
-Do you really think that makes any sense?
-Tell me why it wouldn't.

120
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:07,260
We should be open
to all possibilities now.

121
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,470
You've run out of ideas.
You're not being open.

122
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,222
You'll just buy Sang-muk's statement,

123
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:14,267
and then assume
this is all a coincidence, right?

124
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,395
Detective, I'm gonna say something.

125
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:20,106
Your team's bias was
clear during the investigation.

126
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:23,151
-You refused to cooperate--
-So that's the point you wanted to make.

127
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,113
I get that you wanna saddle us
with all the responsibility,

128
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,948
so you can leave here blameless.

129
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,242
Love your show, by the way.

130
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,786
You said this was fun,
and now I saw it firsthand.

131
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:37,623
Aah.

132
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,302
It airs at ten past ten every Friday.

133
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,762
Make sure you watch it live.

134
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,514
Yeah, I'm a big fan.

135
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,479
Hey, Kim. Hey.

136
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,646
Have you eaten?

137
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,940
-Yes.
-Why'd you eat so early?

138
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,611
Okay. Let's play some badminton, then.

139
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:08,696
Good for the stomach.

140
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,532
-Now?
-Yes, now.

141
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,993
-Right now?
-Yes. Right now.

142
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,578
Loser buys <i>soju?</i>

143
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,996
-Sure, yeah.
-Hmm.

144
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,291
God. Those dumbasses.

145
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,502
We got some armchair detectives here.
Watch out.

146
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:28,216
Guys. Don't you think they're relying
too much on behavioral analysis?

147
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,968
They have to approach
it geographically too.

148
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,263
Murderers don't just choose
their crime scenes at random.

149
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,806
They usually stay near their house,

150
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,935
or, at least, they stay
within a pretty small radius

151
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,521
of their normal daily activities.

152
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,647
Come on.

153
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,441
How pathetic.

154
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,111
Aah.

155
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,238
Time to eat.

156
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,535
Yes, <i>jjajangmyeon!</i>

157
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,328
Uh…

158
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,916
-Hello?
-You're lookin' well. You busy?

159
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,127
<i>No, I'm not busy.</i>

160
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,004
<i>But I was just about to eat.</i>

161
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,589
<i>Huh.</i>

162
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,883
<i>So, what brings you here?</i>

163
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:20,142
So you're saying that these cases look
like a series of serial murders, right?

164
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,936
It's possible, is all I'm saying.

165
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,188
You haven't changed a bit.

166
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,106
QUICK DELIVERY

167
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:29,944
You're still… how should I put it?
As stubborn and obsessive as I remembered.

168
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,446
Oh, uh, those are kind of expensive.

169
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,032
Please, just be real careful.

170
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:42,540
Hey, so, don't you think it's
kind of weird that there's no evidence?

171
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,750
-Nothing?
-There's no evidence?

172
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,795
It shows how the police
fumbled the initial investigation.

173
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,797
They can't cooperate or communicate.

174
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,050
To connect the cases,
they need to find at least something, but…

175
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,595
Isn't that how you got caught, hmm?

176
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,347
Oh, come on.
That was a long time ago.

177
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,974
-So?
-That's embarrassing, man.

178
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,311
Cut to the chase.
Is it a serial murderer, or what?

179
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,939
The way I see it,

180
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,441
it's not a serial murderer.

181
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,860
You don't think so? Why not?

182
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,863
-I'm looking at the earlier cases.
-Mm?

183
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:17,116
The murders don't look premeditated.
They're accidental and impulsive.

184
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,577
The murderer was using blunt weapons
rather than a knife.

185
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,705
But if you look at a later case…

186
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,165
-Here.
-Hmm.

187
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,000
The killer used a knife.

188
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,420
<i>They stabbed the victim four times.</i>

189
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,380
<i>He did that without any hesitation.</i>

190
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,174
<i>As if murder was the sole purpose.</i>

191
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:34,759
Hmm.

192
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:38,471
That's what makes this one completely
different from the case you brought me.

193
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,930
-No way it's the same person?
-No.

194
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,891
How would a person go from sharp to blunt?

195
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,309
-Exactly, yeah.
-Hmm.

196
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,477
So I'm thinking,

197
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,646
what if we place

198
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,857
the prosecutor right in the middle?

199
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,360
-Does that make a difference?
-The prosecutor?

200
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,444
Hmm.

201
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:56,489
That might change the story, then.

202
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,531
-Does it really?
-Yes.

203
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,992
Because Prosecutor Ji
was stabbed with a knife.

204
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,118
-Hmm.
-It was sloppy.

205
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,870
-But the killer stabbed him once.
-Mm-hmm.

206
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:06,082
So the killer might not have been
as experienced at that point.

207
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,960
But he could've been rehearsing.
And after that, he was doing it perfectly.

208
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,838
-So, could be the killer gradually…
-Evolved from one to another.

209
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,006
-Exactly. Yeah.
-Ah.

210
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,509
So, in fact, a serial murderer is likely.

211
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,010
Yeah, that's right.

212
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,932
-But… don't you find it odd?
-What?

213
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,310
I mean, it's not like the victims
confess their sins to the killer.

214
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,813
So, then, how do they all
end up being criminals?

215
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,691
Isn't that interesting?

216
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,570
So what's Prosecutor Ji's crime?

217
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,616
Awesome, thank you.

218
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,870
Anyway, the conclusion here is that

219
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,498
I don't really think
it's a serial murderer.

220
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:50,334
-That's just my opinion.
-Mm. Did you hear that?

221
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,712
All right, good.

222
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,630
Okay. I'll let you in.

223
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,382
Wait. Who are you letting in?

224
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,302
You've been hacking
the prosecution's intranet again.

225
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,139
-What?
-Prosecutor Ji's case is confidential.

226
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,890
How'd you know about it in such detail?

227
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,101
Well, it was all over the news.

228
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,687
-Come on in.
-Thanks. Pardon the intrusion.

229
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,731
-Say hi to the detective.
-Who are you?

230
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:16,110
-Let's go. We'll talk at the station.
-This is an illegal arrest.

231
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,988
You can't do this without a warrant.
This is abuse of power.

232
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,157
-I'm being detained unlawfully. I'm not--
-Here.

233
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,950
Who says we're arresting you?

234
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,618
-You broke his head.
-Hmm?

235
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,787
Choose your fate very carefully, okay?

236
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,164
One.

237
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:32,960
You can cooperate, come to the station,
answer some questions, and come back home.

238
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:33,919
Two.

239
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,798
I come back another time
with a search-and-seizure warrant.

240
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:38,799
Which one?

241
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,553
We might turn this place
upside down while we're at it.

242
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,724
Mr. Profiler, you must love playing
with your toys. Isn't that right?

243
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,728
Bet you'd love putting them back together.

244
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,986
<i>-I can't tell if I can see through this.</i>
<i>-Mr. Roh.</i>

245
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,155
<i>-Yeah?</i>
<i>-Take a seat.</i>

246
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:03,574
<i>Okay.</i>

247
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:04,909
What is this?

248
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,702
Why am I here?

249
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,414
You two call the shots,
and you're in the same room.

250
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,625
-Saves me time.
-<i>We're not done yet.</i>

251
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,754
Captain. I admit he looks a little odd.

252
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,507
But if we apply pressure,
we'll find something useful.

253
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,301
You heard him talk
about the prosecutor's case in detail.

254
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,886
<i>I've told you everything.</i>

255
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,971
Know what it feels like at my age

256
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,475
to have the chief scream and spit
in my face 'cause of stunts like this?

257
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:33,020
-<i>Let me get these in order.</i>
-I'm just trying to retire in peace.

258
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,065
I'm so sick of this nonsense.

259
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,484
Come on, Captain. Please. Huh?

260
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,618
Consider this penance
for the late prosecutor, okay?

261
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,788
We're not sure what it is,

262
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:53,749
but it's beginning to look
like the man had a lot to hide.

263
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,962
His death is linked to other cases,
so it's the prosecution's headache too.

264
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,005
We're not catching much heat just yet.

265
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,633
But if these turn out to be
serial murders, we'll be in trouble.

266
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,343
-Okay. Okay.
-Give it a try.

267
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,679
If anything comes up,
let me know right away.

268
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,514
-Am I understood?
-Of course, sir.

269
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:09,682
Hmm.

270
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,517
-Good night, sir!
-All right.

271
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,061
By the books, no mistakes.

272
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,403
-Hey.
-Yeah.

273
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,238
A warrant would just be embarrassing.

274
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,574
Says he found it on some website.
It's a non-starter.

275
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,533
Hmm.

276
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,369
Though there really is
something fishy going on with that guy.

277
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,831
-I mean, I've got nothing at the moment.
-Hmm. Yeah, it's fine.

278
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:37,084
-Let's send him back for the time being.
-It's okay. Thank you for your help.

279
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,711
-We'll get going.
-Bye.

280
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,338
-Hmm. Wait, wait, wait.
-What?

281
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,049
Did you… want this to happen?

282
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:48,012
Consider this payback
for that favor I owe you.

283
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:51,056
This may not be an official investigation,
but the captain gave approval,

284
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,142
so all you need to do is sit tight.

285
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:54,685
All right?

286
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:57,187
I'll call later. You did great today, huh?

287
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,981
-Hmm?
-Well, thank you, sir.

288
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,108
-I'm goin' home.
-Good night, sir.

289
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,862
Aren't you hungry?
You didn't eat the <i>jjajangmyeon.</i>

290
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,158
It got all mushy and soggy.

291
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,160
Let's go eat, then. It'll be my treat.

292
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,329
I'm not hungry.

293
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:17,499
Listen, if you get caught hacking
into the prosecution's intranet again,

294
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,418
I'll really have to have you detained,
huh?

295
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,754
I told you back at my place,
I didn't hack--

296
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,714
Don't jerk me around, you moron.

297
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,302
If you're gonna say something,
just say it.

298
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:37,895
What do you think the difference is
between coincidence and fate?

299
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,523
Hmm? I mean, think about it.

300
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,402
There are all these murders
happening in Daejeon,

301
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,488
but not a single thing connects them.

302
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,408
I mean, no one can be sure
that there's no connection.

303
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,995
But anyway, that's not on me.
That's your job.

304
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,206
I'm just frustrated, that's all.

305
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,416
We still don't have any leads.

306
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,421
Do you still play superhero these days?

307
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,133
No, I'm not a kid anymore.
I don't do that stuff. No way.

308
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,638
You can do whatever you like,
but you gotta be more careful.

309
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,807
And call me right away
if something comes up.

310
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,892
-For your own good.
-I want to cooperate with you.

311
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,061
I want to catch bad guys too.

312
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,855
You just took things way too far
this time, all right?

313
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,233
I'm serious.

314
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,612
I'm getting something tasty.
Sure you're not eating?

315
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,341
Hmm.

316
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,594
Oh God.

317
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,865
Hey. I wasn't in jail.
What's with the tofu?

318
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,826
I don't know. I saw it on TV.

319
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,789
-We gotta be careful. I'm stressed out.
-Why?

320
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,333
This cop's totally been harassing me.

321
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,669
If you're on his radar,
he's gonna find you. No matter what.

322
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,798
So, then, what do we do?

323
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,887
Excuse me.

324
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,807
I'm with the police.

325
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,184
Let me ask you something.

326
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,686
You frequently deliver to 307, right?

327
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,899
-Hmm.
-Where did you just deliver to?

328
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,442
Unit 307.

329
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,152
Unit 307?

330
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,865
JUNGHWARU
QUICK DELIVERY

331
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,746
Is this guy an accomplice, do you think?

332
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,748
<i>He seemed like a run-of-the-mill nerd.</i>

333
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,793
<i>That's what I thought at first.</i>

334
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,254
<i>But there's more to him</i>
<i>than you'd think.</i>

335
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,964
Meticulous little piece of shit.

336
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,342
What did he do?

337
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,136
A long time ago,

338
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,764
there was this bastard
that I knew I had to catch.

339
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,560
-He was a murderer too.
-Hmm.

340
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,811
And the kid

341
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,688
looked after that murderer.

342
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,652
But I don't know if he's related
to this case or not. I'm just not sure.

343
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,195
But we'll see.

344
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,533
The bastard you just mentioned.

345
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,535
Was it that cop?

346
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,622
Why do you wanna catch this guy so badly?

347
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,208
Christ, we're not on a picnic, man. Huh?

348
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,752
So many questions.

349
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,217
So? Did you ask him?

350
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:41,305
Yeah. He's from Junghwaru.
An extra large <i>jjajangmyeon </i>to unit 307.

351
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:44,308
But he's never seen the guy's face well.
He's always wearing his helmet.

352
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:47,186
-He's always wearing his helmet?
-Yeah, why?

353
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,771
Awesome, thank you!

354
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,822
What? What is it?

355
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,033
-What's going on?
-Get that delivery guy.

356
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:01,992
-What?
-Sir?

357
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,119
-Now, quickly.
-Sir, wait. What are you doing?

358
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,518
What is it?

359
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,562
What? What's going on?

360
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,232
What's going on?

361
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,569
Hey, what on earth are you doing?

362
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,322
-Hey…
-I knew you'd do this again.

363
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,076
Did you choose the victims for him too?

364
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,411
Choose what victims?

365
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,083
Man, at least just tell me
what's going on.

366
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,793
He can't expect us to chase some guy down.

367
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,087
I didn't see him at first,
but that has to be him, right?

368
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,421
-On the right.
-I think so.

369
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,340
-It is.
-Speed up. Get closer.

370
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,224
-It's the one with "Junghwaru" on it.
-Junghwaru?

371
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,558
Junghwaru, Junghwaru…

372
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,979
All right, so there's two of them.
I can't tell which is which.

373
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,772
-Uh…
-That one. That one.

374
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,108
-Which one?
-License 32561. 3256--

375
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,610
That one? Way up front? Are you sure?

376
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:19,528
Yeah.

377
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,737
I'll go catch him.

378
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,325
Scuse me!

379
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:27,786
Scuse me!

380
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,292
Hold on! Junghwaru!

381
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:34,960
Hey!

382
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,539
Here we go. One, two, three.

383
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,417
Wait, no. This is crazy heavy.

384
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,926
Hey, Junghwaru.

385
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,056
Call Lee Tang right now.

386
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,893
Who's Lee Tang? I don't know him.

387
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,438
-Oh, you don't know who he is? Huh?
-That's right.

388
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,773
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

389
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,233
Don't fucking play dumb,
you stupid little shit.

390
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,362
Now tell me how you hid the evidence.

391
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,571
Hid the evidence?

392
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,366
-Do you have proof that I--
-Answer me, asshole.

393
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,994
This is what you do, pick targets
based on a guess, with no evidence.

394
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,288
You miss the culprit every time.
That's why I--

395
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,584
-This is how you missed the guy last time!
-What did you just say, asshole?

396
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,253
-Who did I miss?
-Excessive force! Excessive force!

397
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,755
Excessive force?

398
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,215
How is this excessive, huh?

399
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:06,927
Hey, is it excessive force
when you're resisting arrest?

400
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,054
Is it?

401
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:13,850
Answer me, smart-ass. You use fancy words
and think you can get away with this?

402
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,769
Huh? Hey.

403
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,729
Spill it, you son of a bitch.

404
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,564
Sir.

405
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,108
-I caught him.
-Bring him here.

406
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,859
-I can't be here right now.
-Hold on.

407
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,361
-My boss'll be pissed.
-Who's this?

408
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,238
The Junghwaru delivery guy.

409
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,865
-This isn't the guy I told you to catch!
-<i>Yong-jae.</i>

410
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,409
-I didn't do anything!
-He's not?

411
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,827
-God, this sucks.
-Who is this guy?

412
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,329
-Yes, sir.
<i>-Is Nan-gam with you? Put him on.</i>

413
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,331
-The captain wants to talk to you.
-Look--

414
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,583
-Okay, so am I free to go<i>?</i>
-Hold on, hold on.

415
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,252
-Moron.
-<i>Jang Nan-gam!</i>

416
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,504
-Yes, sir.
<i>-Oh, there he is.</i>

417
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:45,048
<i>-Why haven't you answered my calls?</i>
<i>-</i>I'm a little busy.

418
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,300
-Can I call you later?
<i>-No. This can't wait.</i>

419
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,553
<i>It's all over the internet, you damn punk!</i>

420
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:52,973
<i>-What are you doing at Roh Bin's place?</i>
-What's all over the internet?

421
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,516
<i>Video of you beating him.</i>

422
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,309
<i>-It's everywhere, you idiot!</i>
-Huh?

423
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,729
<i>-You can't barge in and rough him up!</i>
-<i>Open up!</i>

424
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,524
<i>-We're getting calls about a cop--</i>
-I'll call you back.

425
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,568
You hear that, too, right?

426
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,987
I think they're in there.

427
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,532
We're here about the report!

428
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,578
I'll try and get them to open up.
You call the office.

429
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,621
This is the police.

430
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,833
Open the door.

431
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,503
If you don't,
we will open it by force.

432

Open up right now!

433
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:35,432

-I'm a sidekick.
-What?

00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:05,053
Batman and Robin.
Sherlock and Watson. Goku and Krillin.

Uh, how did you get this?

492
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:35,333
I told you.
I've been hard at work looking for you.

TOMORROW, 12. HOUSE WITH BLUE DOORS
BY THE YONGUN INTERSECTION

496
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:54,853
You only suspected you have special
powers, but you were never fully sure?

497
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:57,272
Take a look at this.

498
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,402
What do you think
these cases have in common?

499
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:08,575
One, all the victims were pieces of shit.

500
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:12,871
Two, you didn't get rid of any evidence
after, but it did just disappear, right?

501
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,999
The evidence…

502
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,584
What could all of this mean?

503
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:23,590
The way I see it, some higher power
is telling you to continue your work.

504
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:27,510
For me, that's the only explanation.

505
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,389
It's unreal. Doesn't make sense.

506
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,683
What do you want from me?

507
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,520
To serve justice with you.

508
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,107
-Huh?
-Let's work together, Mr. Lee.

509
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,360
I'll give you anything that you want.

510
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:48,781
I have 50 million won.
It's my life savings.

511
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,159
If you need any money,
I'll give it to you.

512
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,871
And you said you wanted to visit
the Rocky Mountains someday, didn't you?

513
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,623
I can send you there if you want.

514
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:59,584
So I'm asking you,
please, can we just give it a try?

515
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,586
I… I'm serious.

516
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,761
No, no…

517
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:10,845
Uh, I…

518
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,513
You did nothing wrong, Mr. Lee.

519
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,849
All you did was clean up human garbage.

520
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:18,645
Cleaning up isn't a crime,
so there's no need for you to run.

521
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,521
That's all I'm trying to tell you.

522
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,482
If you decide to work with me,

523
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:25,568
I'll make it
so you don't have to run anymore.

524
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,821
Want some breakfast?

525
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,700
So, in simple terms,

526
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,077
your powers work like this, okay?

527
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,079
When you see a piece of trash,

528
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:19,914
you want to throw it away.

529
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:25,044
And of course, what you do is
you trash the trash, obviously.

530
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,923
Hey!
That man over there just littered!

531
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,091
Wait, hold on.

532
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,220
So, what? I just start
stabbing people on the subway?

533
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,264
And you're saying
they'll all have deserved to die?

534
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:39,684
And that the evidence will disappear?
That makes no sense.

535
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,479
Look, have you ever

536
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,356
felt an urge?

537
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,276
I mean, have you gotten a sign to do it?

538
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,404
No.

539
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,156
That's perfect.

540
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,533
That's also part of your powers, then.

541
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:03,082
In order to throw away trash,
you need to have a trash can.

542
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,879
Bearing all that in mind,
I think we were destined to meet.

543
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:11,215
Of course, the decision is up to you.

544
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,553
Hey.

545
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:17,680
Sleep over.

546
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,269
-By the way, <i>hyung.</i>
-Yeah?

547
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,191
You said you had two partners before me.

548
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,109
Where are they right now?

549
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:31,986
You've already seen

550
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,655
one of them already.

551
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,201
And the one before him…

552
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,038
I hope we never have to see him again.

553
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:45,208
Who… who is that?

554
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:51,506
There's some stuff
behind the shelf.

555
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,927
Take what you want from there.

556
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:03,351
PERSONAL DETAILS
YEO BU-IL

557
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:16,817
I'm sorry.

558
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:18,694
Are you okay, sir?

559
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,029
Ah, it was nothing.

560
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:22,073
He should apologize
for bumping into you.

561
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:23,532
Nah, it's fine…

562
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,577
For a prosecutor,
you're very forgiving.

563
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,547
Ah. Going to Noeun-dong?

564
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,925
This is my car. Come on. Let's go.

565
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,688
All I've ever done is work.

566
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,773
It's not a crime, please.

567
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,191
I have a family.

568
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,402
My daughter, she started middle school.

569
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,280
What else was I supposed to do? Huh?

570
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,241
Look, please,
just tell me what I did wrong.

571
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,452
Say it. Tell me what I did.

572
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,787
-Please.
-Yeah, I know.

573
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:56,250
-Why do I even want to kill you?
-Wait.

574
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,796
Wait. What do you mean?

575
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,216
What crime could you have done?

576
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,511
-What?
-To have brought us both here tonight?

577
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:10,139
How am I even supposed to know?

578
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:16,312
You don't know a single thing
about my life.

579
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,948
I think he might tell us.

580
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:28,949
What?

581
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,081
Okay.

582
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:40,002
This is why
I can't ever save up any money.

583
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,256
Okay.

584
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:45,966
We're in.

585
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:47,927
Hmm…

586
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:54,141
Hey.

587
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:55,518
Hey!

588
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,024
-<i>Hey, you've got curly hair.</i>
-Uh, sir! Excuse me!

589
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,360
Please! I can explain!

590
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:05,694
-Okay?
-<i>Hey.</i>

591
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,406
<i>-You're too pretty to be crying like this.</i>
-I can explain!

592
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,699
-Let's talk about this rationally!
<i>-Stop struggling.</i>

593
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:11,992
Okay? Sir!

594
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,786
<i>-Good job.</i>
-Please, sir!

595
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,579
<i>-Stay still. Shut up.</i>
-I can explain!

596
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:18,290
<i>-Stop crying, you bitch!</i>
-Fuck! Hey. Sir! Sir!

597
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,292
It… it's not what it looks like!

598
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,003
You… you're doing this for money,
aren't you?

599
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:26,507
I can give you money!
I will! Okay? I will pay you.

600
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,676
I will. Wait. Wait, wait!

601
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,010
I'm sorry!

602
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,887
I'm so sorry! I'm sorry!

603
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,021
Why don't we go home?

604
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,066
Home?

605
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,780
Look, Roh Bin, I wanna live on my own.

606
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:52,259
One, two. Good.

607
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,512
Ah, you're back again? Ready to work out?

608
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:55,471
Good, great!

609
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:56,889
Really lean into it, okay?

610
00:41:56,972 --> 00:42:00,017
All right! One, two! There you go!

611
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:17,576
HOW IS THIS UNJUSTIFIED
WHEN YOU'RE RESISTING ARREST?

612
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,039
God damn.

613
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:10,708
Hey, I'm back.

614
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,045
Scuse me.

615
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:18,757
Boss, are we behind on deliveries?

616
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,885
Shit. I said we need more guys.

617
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,474
Can I ask you somethin'?

618
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,059
Me?

619
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,276
Yeah.

620
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,653
SONG CHON
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

621
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:46,452
You know this man, that right?

622
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:48,537
Oh, yeah.

623
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,955
It's Tang, sure.

624
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,623
Huh.

625
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:52,875
-Why--
-Where'd he go?

626
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:56,670
It's all right.

627
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:59,089
Just wanna talk to him.
