1
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:36,828
Don't be scared.

2
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:38,747
They're blanks, guys.

3
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:41,082
It's not easy

4
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,795
finding bullets in a country
that doesn't allow us to have guns.

5
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,882
I got five more shots.

6
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,634
Hey, you gotta get closer. Come on.

7
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,636
Come on, bring it in.

8
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,597
Come on, you bastards. Go get him!

9
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,932
Uh… But he's got a gun.

10
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:01,227
He just told you they're
fucking blanks! Go on! Hurry!

11
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,813
Go! Get him, you assholes!

12
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,612
-Come on! That's it!
-Motherfucker!

13
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,124
Come here! Yes, you!

14
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,341
Come here, asshole!

15
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,346
-You! You bastard!
-Bastard!

16
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,972
Motherfucker!

17
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,018
Damn it.

18
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,742
You asshole!

19
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,413
Hey, two shots.
He's got two left. Two! That's it!

20
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,582
It must be nice to be young!

21
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,293
Shit…

22
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:57,927
That last one…

23
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,430
that was real.

24
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,224
Where are you?

25
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,185
<i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>

26
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,645
Yeah? What's going on?

27
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,813
He…

28
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,817
He, uh… he snuck into the alley,

29
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,320
but we lost him.

30
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,988
You lost an old guy?

31
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,074
End the call.

32
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,035
Sir, uh…

33
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,163
You…

34
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,207
you little shit.

35
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,423
Good work.

36
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,844
Now, where were we?

37
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,223
He said…

38
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,351
to… to bring you alive.

39
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,188
So… so he could do what you did
to his granddaughter.

40
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,106
Wait a minute. Hang on. I know this.

41
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,192
The… the, uh…

42
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,569
the… art bitch, huh?

43
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,321
Yeah?

44
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,782
God, what was her name? Her name, uh…

45
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,200
Hyeong…

46
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,118
-H… Hyeong Ji-su.
-Hyeong Ji-su!

47
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,373
Hyeong Jeong-guk, Hyeong Ji-su.

48
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,334
Hah!

49
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,310
A KILLER PARADOX

50
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,534
I appreciate it. Ah!

51
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,834
How'd you become a detective, sir?

52
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,837
Why do you ask?

53
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,632
I don't know.
You know, what led you to it?

54
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,977
-Well, uh, my dad was on the force, so…
-Oh.

55
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,063
<i>He was a peculiar man.</i>

56
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,025
<i>So you became a cop</i>
<i>to follow in his footsteps?</i>

57
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,609
<i>No, it's the opposite.</i>

58
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:22,030
<i>It was because</i>
<i>I didn't wanna be looked down on.</i>

59
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,210
-Hey, Nan-gam.
-Hello, sir.

60
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,964
Leave it there.

61
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:46,054
<i>My father was this cold, gruff man,</i>

62
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,223
<i>who never smiled at me, even once.</i>

63
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,517
<i>All he ever did was scold me.</i>

64
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,910
Hey, you brat! You little…

65
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,579
What are you doing going
through my stuff, huh? Huh?

66
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,290
What are you, a thief now?

67
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,125
Huh?

68
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,002
Is that what you want to be?

69
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,923
<i>When he was having a bad day,</i>
<i>he would lash out at me for no reason.</i>

70
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,841
Now, how's five hits sound?
With this.

71
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,343
STAR KARAOKE

72
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:26,677
And it's gonna hurt.

73
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,472
-What do you say?
-What is it this time? Hmm?

74
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:32,016
-Well?
-Oh, this little shit.

75
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,267
He ratted me out to his mom.

76
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,645
He told her that I'd been going there.

77
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:39,107
-Nan-gam, you'll get it when you grow up.
-<i>He looked for excuses to bully me.</i>

78
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,817
Take it back, boss.

79
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,362
-It's not mine, though.
-Hey, go on. Get to work. Hurry.

80
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,781
Right, I left it here. Yeah.

81
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,032
Apologize, now.

82
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,576
Beg for mercy.

83
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,789
<i>But one day, I didn't feel</i>
<i>like taking his crap anymore.</i>

84
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:55,790
Am I clear?

85
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,460
<i>And I guess it just stopped</i>
<i>being fun for him.</i>

86
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,089
<i>Ever since then, he stopped bothering me.</i>

87
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,048
Huh.

88
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,802
<i>That's when I learned my lesson.</i>

89
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,055
<i>I didn't want to be pathetic.</i>

90
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,098
<i>What was it?</i>

91
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,182
What?

92
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,101
Uh, the lesson you mentioned just then?

93
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,314
Oh, it was…

94
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,027
if you don't want them
to have power over you,

95
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,321
don't give them
the reaction they're seeking.

96
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,574
Somethin' like that.

97
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,245
So why did I bring this up
all of a sudden?

98
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm saying you should do the same.

99
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,550
TO BE PUT DOWN
BASED ON THE AGGRESSION TEST RESULT

100
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,886
That one extra line could
either save him or kill him.

101
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:54,056
He'll get his test this week
by the professional trainers.

102
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,019
We're gonna do a behavioral test and refer
to other foreign materials as well.

103
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,145
Hmm…

104
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,607
This is our first time,
so I want to set a good precedent.

105
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,566
Here, drink this.

106
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,361
How do you think it's gonna go?

107
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,781
Well, he's been staying with you,
so what do you think, sir?

108
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,658
Not sure.

109
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,078
If the euthanasia gets canceled,

110
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,373
we'll get him some more training
and we'll find him a new owner.

111
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:23,044
It won't be easy.
He was involved in such a huge case.

112
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,214
Detective?

113
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:29,675
Any chance you want to keep him?
He seems to like you.

114
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,347
I don't know
that I'm really cut out for that.

115
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:38,142
Whatever happens, that's it, I guess.

116
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,273
<i>Jang, did you get the call?</i>

117
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,316
CAPTAIN MOON MYEONG-JUN

118
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,692
<i>I pulled some strings.</i>

119
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,278
<i>I'll get you as many men as you need.</i>

120
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,280
<i>Let's do this.</i>

121
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,158
Yes, sir. Appreciate it.

122
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,869
I'll be getting there on time.

123
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,247
<i>All right. See you soon.</i>

124
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,877
-A bit further to this side.
-Okay.

125
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,088
Can we fast-forward a little more?

126
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,423
-Sure.
-Yeah, there.

127
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:13,511
This bar's been closed for a long time,
so no one really comes here.

128
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,097
But we got calls from nearby
shop owners that heard gunshots.

129
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,473
Were the hell did he get a gun?

130
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,600
There's Lee Tang. Yeah.

131
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,394
-That's him.
-Hmm.

132
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,692
Roll it back to the beginning
of the footage real quick.

133
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:28,776
Okay.

134
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,364
-Stop.
-Okay.

135
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,907
Who are all those guys?

136
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,076
Oh, them.
They're from Gajok Construction.

137
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,620
Looks like our Roh Bin got in touch
with them before we could.

138
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,081
REINSTATE WORKERS
CHAIRMAN HYEONG JEONG-GUK, RESIGN

139
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,542
-We said no. You need a warrant.
-Come on!

140
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,377
-We'll just be a minute.
-Resign!

141
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,045
We'll be out in no time.

142
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,381
-Reinstate fired workers!
-No. We're busy.

143
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,216
-I said leave!
-Come on.

144
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,385
Hey! You're obstructing business, huh?

145
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,221
-You don't have a warrant, do you?
-Yes, sir.

146
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,390
-Resign!
-I can't even get in the building.

147
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:02,226
Yeah, they just won't allow us to go in.

148
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:07,106
-All right. You can wrap it up for now--
-Excuse me.

149
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,483
I think I found it, sir.

150
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,277
Look… there.

151
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:15,072
This is as far as I can zoom in.

152
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,699
And that alley back there…

153
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,493
it doesn't have any cameras installed yet.

154
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,003
HAPPY MOTEL

155
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,004
Hello.

156
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,380
Have you seen this man?

157
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,341
He's pretty tall.

158
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,220
Not that I'm aware of, no.

159
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,266
-Are you really cops, though?
-Yes, from Mapo. Here's my ID.

160
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:47,396
It's just that some thugs were
asking about the same man earlier.

161
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,606
Some thugs?

162
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,609
Huge guys. They were
walking around all thug-like.

163
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:52,526
When was that?

164
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,571
I'd say about an hour ago. Yeah.

165
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,073
How many of them were there?

166
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,367
Four or five guys, I think.

167
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,612
Hey, what the…

168
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,157
Sir, take a look at this.

169
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,493
What is it? Blood?

170
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,745
Jesus. What does it say?

171
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,122
I APOLOGIZE
I REPENT WITH MY DEATH

172
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,623
A letter of apology?

173
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,973
Shall we escape
this complicated world together?

174
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,059
Huh?

175
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,482
SHALL WE ESCAPE
THIS COMPLICATED WORLD TOGETHER?

176
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,281
Let's go.

177
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,325
And don't worry.

178
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,537
-About what?
-Song Chon'll be caught soon.

179
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,748
-What about us?
-We--

180
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,458
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

181
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,877
We'll go somewhere no one can find us.

182
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:36,046
-Where are we gonna go?
-South.

183
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,215
Like, south where?

184
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:44,472
Listen.

185
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:46,974
I've got a plan.

186
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,394
And I've figured out a way
to solve all of our problems.

187
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:54,982
All we need to do is go somewhere warm
in the south and chart out the future.

188
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,278
Well… if you'll come along with me.

189
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,460
-Oops.
-Hey.

190
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,629
Sorry, I haven't driven in a while.

191
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,640
Here,
your second phone has been activated.

192
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:31,393
This was the registered owner
of the burner. Say hello.

193
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,690
-Where is she--
-Just messing. You look so serious.

194
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,777
Oh. Here's 500,000 won.

195
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,987
Okay, great, yeah.

196
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,491
It's just… they've been
really cracking down on us,

197
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,786
and, uh, it's been especially hard
to find new identities these…

198
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,246
Hey, come on. Hey, dude.

199
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,498
-Things have been tough!
-Sorry to hear that. Bye.

200
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:59,797
HELP FIND MY MISSING SON (MALE, 20S)
PLEASE CONTACT US IF YOU SEE HIM

201
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,744
She's been coming to the morning
service pretty often these days.

202
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:31,745
Who?

203
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,164
Right there.
The lady sitting in the front row.

204
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,125
Oh, you mean Deacon Kim?

205
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,336
Haven't you heard?
Her son's been missing for quite a while.

206
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,256
Oh no. Seriously? For how long?

207
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,842
Oh God, that poor thing.

208
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,266
God, please…

209
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,361
Hello!

210
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,697
Aah!

211
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,325
What took you so long, huh?

212
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,452
Yeah, I waited a while.

213
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,830
Ah, shit.

214
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,759
So where is he?

215
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,387
Where's the chairman?

216
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:15,057
The last footage of him
was in the Magok area.

217
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,184
His whereabouts are unknown since then.

218
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,062
Look, if you watch here,
he's moving around,

219
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,524
operating as if he, uh… knows
where all the cameras are located.

220
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,527
How far is this place
from that Gajok Construction,

221
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,612
or Buyeon, or whatever it's called now?

222
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,156
It's about a ten-minute drive, I believe.

223
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,199
Ten minutes.

224
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,205
SONG CHON

225
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,082
HYEONG JEONG-GUK
CHAIRMAN

226
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,292
Do we have a location on Chairman Hyeong?

227
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,713
We have a couple of places
in mind, don't we?

228
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:50,092
Yeah… The only thing is, uh,
they rejected our warrant request, so--

229
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,052
Hey, I'm not trying
to meet Chairman Hyeong.

230
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,263
We need to look for places
Song Chon might go.

231
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,558
Well, uh… Look, I really don't think
he would take it that far, though.

232
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,810
-Yeah, we don't have to--
-Uh, I know this bastard.

233
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,730
He absolutely would.
Why do you think he's still in the area?

234
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,024
So where is Chairman Hyeong?

235
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,608
Uh…

236
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,237
This was technically off the record,
but apparently

237
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,240
he's at a very private location.

238
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,284
Then that's where
Song Chon will likely go.

239
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,619
Huh? I'll take the heat if it goes wrong.

240
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,204
-Let's go. Come with me.
-Okay.

241
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,123
Great.

242
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:27,546
CAPTAIN MOON MYEONG-JUN

243
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,012
Yes, sir, it's, um…

244
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,222
it's me, yeah, uh…

245
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,934
The chairman, he wants to be alone.

246
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,646
He doesn't want anyone
to come in for a while.

247
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,856
<i>For how long?</i>

248
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,359
For how long?

249
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,072
Mm… an hour.

250
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,076
For one hour.

251
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,037
Okay.

252
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:02,748
That was good.

253
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,543
All right, then.

254
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,214
Take this

255
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,175
and have a nice little nap, huh?

256
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,644
-What'd the girl say?
-Hmm?

257
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,065
What do you think?
He wants to be alone for a while.

258
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,274
Hah! Why?

259
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,694
'Cause he's mourning
his granddaughter's death

260
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,322
with a girl her same age.

261
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,366
An admirable man, shit.

262
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,326
If that's the life you wanna live…

263
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,457
Now

264
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,043
we can have

265
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,837
a nice little chat.

266
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,300
You, sir, are a…

267
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,678
a very compelling man.

268
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:03,642
I heard it's easier
to list the things that you can't do

269
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,602
than to find the things that you can.

270
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,689
You're a minor, aren't you?

271
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,733
-No, I'm not.
-I could have you arrested right now.

272
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,987
-All right! Sir!
-Yes?

273
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,072
-Pour you a glass?
-Absolutely.

274
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,866
-Your health, sir!
-Drink up!

275
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,827
<i>Back-alley thugs</i>
<i>to government higher-ups.</i>

276
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,786
Drink up!

277
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,872
<i>You have connections everywhere.</i>

278
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,707
Hmm. Where's my cigarette?

279
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,667
Aah.

280
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,796
Oh, no, sir, let me, let me.

281
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,006
Come on…

282
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,681
TAX EVASION, EMBEZZLEMENT, BRIBERY

283
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,517
Just… consider this
a short holiday, sir. Huh?

284
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,103
<i>Even when you were in prison,</i>

285
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:52,232
<i>you had all those people</i>
<i>lining up to do you a favor.</i>

286
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,986
I'm pretty certain that we'll get
you that pardon that we're after.

287
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,654
Only two pieces of eel?

288
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,490
You should have brought more of it.

289
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,827
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
The fresh fish looked great today.

290
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:04,953
Take your time.

291
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:10,667
With you around, no wonder
your granddaughter turned out how she did.

292
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,919
You guys were alike.

293
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,095
I heard that

294
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:26,975
a lot of people died
because of the buildings you demolished.

295
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,562
How do you think
the victims' families would feel,

296
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:36,068
seeing that dumb little smirk of yours
on the TV?

297
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:42,199
You know, I can't just sit around
when I witness injustice.

298
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:49,456
You'll be on
the nine o'clock news tomorrow too.

299
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,875
It's a real shame
you won't be able to see it.

300
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,965
When you're on the news tomorrow,
people will say,

301
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,300
"Yeah."

302
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,679
"That guy had it coming."

303
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,223
"Whoever killed him's a great guy!"

304
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:11,812
All right.

305
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:12,938
Now it's time

306
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,024
you write your letter of apology.

307
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,902
Today is special.

308
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,321
-So we'll write it--
-He isn't here.

309
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,325
Hey, you can't go in!

310
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,745
-I don't care if you're cops.
-Your boss is in danger!

311
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,425
I-- I think
you should get over here quickly.

312
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,511
Put that down.

313
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,637
This thing

314
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,514
is in his artery.

315
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,852
It's over if I pull this out.
Wanna see some blood, people?

316
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:52,894
Go ahead.

317
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:54,938
But you'll die too.

318
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,607
Hey, chill out, huh?

319
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,693
Hey, just hear me out.

320
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,862
I was gonna turn myself in.

321
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,864
I'm not trying to pull anything here.

322
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,533
Hey, you know me, right?

323
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,660
You've seen my letters back at my place.

324
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,038
Do you think I'm here
to negotiate with you, motherfucker?

325
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,581
Hey, hey, calm down, kid.

326
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:15,917
I'm gonna turn myself in, okay?
Along with all the evidence.

327
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:21,173
It's just, I haven't done enough to this
imbecile chairman to be done with him yet.

328
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:24,384
It would be…
be a real win-win for us both,

329
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:27,971
if the chairman lived and you got
a big promotion. What do you say?

330
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,727
-You…
-That was the last blank.

331
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,687
So keep on running your mouth.

332
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,398
You uptight bastard.

333
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,275
Tell me, sir.

334
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,611
You ever shot a person?

335
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,451
You don't believe I can?

336
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,246
Hey, just a minute.

337
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,832
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

338
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,251
You…

339
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,962
Gap-su's kid? Huh?

340
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,048
Hey, Jang Nan-gam!

341
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,096
Hey! Look how much you've grown.

342
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,848
Feels like yesterday
you were in those poopy diapers.

343
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,309
How's your mother doing?

344
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,529
Hello?

345
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,741
I… told you not to call me at home.

346
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,119
Did you see Nan-gam today?

347
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,163
Aah!

348
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:36,957
Have you eaten?

349
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,667
Hey, little man!

350
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:41,253
God!

351
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,839
Little Nan-gam is a detective now.

352
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,886
Yikes!So much goddamn fun, huh?

353
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:54,808
Aah! What?

354
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,855
You wanna get your revenge
for what I did to your pa?

355
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,234
Come on, do it.

356
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,535
Do it, buddy, come on.

357
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:16,955
What?

358
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,416
You can't, huh?

359
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,252
-Are you scared?
-Where is he? Where is he?

360
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:26,756
And now?

361
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:33,430
That fucking bastard, damn it.
Hey, hey, sir, calm down. Take it easy.

362
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,056
Get down. Get down!

363
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,226
911! Call 911 now! Shit.

364
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,812
Hurry! He's dying.

365
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,778
You're a rascal, bud.

366
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,412
So, he was stabbed,
like this, in the carotid artery.

367
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,289
Yes, go on.

368
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,125
-Hello, sir.
-Hey.

369
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:06,379
Ah, jeez. It would've been perfect
if Chairman Hyeong had just survived.

370
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,718
Well, you should've given me a heads-up.

371
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,429
Sorry. It's just that we were in a hurry.

372
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,932
-Detective Jang.
-Yeah.

373
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:18,600
Listen.

374
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:22,812
Song Chon was the target
of the entire investigation, right?

375
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,357
-Right.
-Mm.

376
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:29,027
So let's not do an investigation
on Chairman Hyeong, then.

377
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,696
Let's not stir up
any extra trouble here, okay?

378
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,281
-Like his personal life.
-Ah, of course.

379
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,367
-I understand what you mean.
-Yeah?

380
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:41,039
Also, there will be a lot of
media focus on you and this case.

381
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:45,585
A detective catches the guy who attacked
his father and left him brain-dead.

382
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,170
That's nice. Huh?

383
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:50,465
You know, people eat up
that kind of story. A real tear-jerker.

384
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,345
You'll be swamped with interviews,
so you can take it easy for a while.

385
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,223
And when you're on TV, well,

386
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:02,394
just try to look sorry for not being
able to save Chairman Hyeong's life.

387
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,354
-Like you… blame yourself.
-Okay. Yep.

388
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:05,981
-Got it?
-Yes, sir.

389
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,232
Okay.

390
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,609
-Okay. See you.
-Good night, sir.

391
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,444
Oh, and another thing.

392
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,574
I heard that your father's
in Gwangjin Hospital.

393
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,243
That's correct.

394
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:25,375
I asked them to go ahead
and transfer him to the police hospital.

395
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,086
A token of my gratitude.

396
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,259
GWANGCHEON SERVICE AREA

397
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,148
You know, my parents,

398
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:32,984
they died when I was really young.

399
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,925
<i>A robber broke into our house.</i>

400
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,470
Did you hear his voice?
Or anything like that?

401
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,015
<i>I couldn't even get my revenge.</i>

402
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,852
<i>I didn't know who the culprit was…</i>

403
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,941
<i>and no one even tried to find them.</i>

404
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,403
<i>That's when I realized.</i>

405
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,575
<i>You need power to carry out justice.</i>

406
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,631
Oh.

407
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,511
<i>But I was weak.</i>

408
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,439
<i>So I decided to borrow power.</i>

409
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:20,842
Hey.

410
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,553
Can you guys, um,

411
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,181
loosen these a little bit?

412
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:27,932
The cuffs.

413
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:31,728
He cuffed me way too tight.
It's so hard to breathe.

414
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:35,899
Ugh. Can't you keep
your mouth shut for two seconds? Shit.

415
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:36,900
Hey.

416
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,862
You wanna have your culprit die
before your eyes? Huh?

417
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:44,115
Quiet, asshole. Don't try that on us.

418
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,409
Oh, so you boys think I'm lying?

419
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,412
How are you gonna deal
with the aftermath, huh?

420
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:53,708
Look. Look! Take a look at my hands.

421
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,002
-Ah, God.
-I've got diabetes.

422
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:58,838
And anemia.

423
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,840
-Hey. Just loosen it up a bit.
-I--

424
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,593
-Just a little. Not all the way.
-Oh, man.

425
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:06,221
-Okay.
-Cut it out. Stop moving.

426
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,305
Here.

427
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,519
Oh!

428
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:15,772
Hey, grab him!

429
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:23,988
I'm gonna kill you!

430
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:25,573
You bastard!

431
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:27,867
Hey!

432
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,260
Die, asshole!

433
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:09,093
-Hello, sir.
-Oh, hello.

434
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,261
Thank you for coming.

435
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,972
Why don't you go and have some food?

436
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,686
Hey. You're here.

437
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,814
-I haven't eaten yet. No time.
-Hello, sir.

438
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:25,693
There are way too many eyes on me.
The public eye can be scary.

439
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:30,490
People always draw their own conclusions,
based on how they look at things.

440
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,327
-Go ahead, take a seat.
-Yes, sir.

441
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,037
Hey, take this.

442
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,873
-Sir.
-Go get a new one. That one hurts. Jeez.

443
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,293
So, what are you thinking?

444
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:47,507
Uh, we'll put an APB out
and do everything we can to catch them.

445
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,677
I heard there were accomplices as well.

446
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,221
The thing is,
there aren't any direct connections,

447
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,264
so we have to continue our search.

448
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,100
So, make something up if you must.

449
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:59,185
You have to get them now.

450
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:02,313
You know our citizens expect
law enforcement to act quickly.

451
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,650
You can't let a criminal
get away on your watch.

452
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:08,695
The case will get out of control
if they're not apprehended.

453
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,655
Yes, you're right, sir.

454
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,075
Hey, I told you
not to bring eel, asshole.

455
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,702
Try not to worry about it, sir.

456
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:18,121
I'll wrap up this case
as fast as possible.

457
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,425
I heard you two were very close.

458
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,262
It won't amount to much, but…

459
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,310
<i>…were transported</i>
<i>to the hospital.</i>

460
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,647
<i>The bus driver and passengers</i>
<i>only suffered minor injuries…</i>

461
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,065
-<i>Hyung.</i>
-Hmm?

462
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,817
<i>The police officers and passengers…</i>

463
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,987
How'd you get the money
for the car and all that?

464
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:51,988
<i>…critical condition.</i>

465
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,823
I thought you spent all your money.

466
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:54,949
<i>…not yet been identified.</i>

467
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,618
Mm, I sold everything. My figurines.

468
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,078
<i>…most likely the case…</i>

469
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,747
-Yeah.
<i>-Some breaking news.</i>

470
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:04,292
<i>The serial killer Song Chon,</i>
<i>who was arrested late last night,</i>

471
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,670
<i>murdered two officers while being</i>
<i>transported to the police station</i>

472
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:08,921
<i>and has escaped.</i>

473
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:12,717
<i>In order to prevent further crimes,</i>
<i>authorities sent out an alert.</i>

474
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,928
<i>They are sending military units as well,</i>
<i>to inspect the surrounding area.</i>

475
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,056
-It's okay.
<i>-Also to run several checkpoints.</i>

476
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:22,477
-We just have to get to a secure place.
-<i>They stated he may not have acted alone.</i>

477
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,353
<i>He had accomplices helping him.</i>

478
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:27,315
<i>The authorities have</i>
<i>two individuals suspected</i>

479
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,734
<i>to have met Song Chon to plan the murder</i>

480
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:32,153
<i>and are now focusing</i>
<i>on their relationship.</i>

481
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,239
<i>Oppa.</i>

482
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,741
<i>Oppa!</i>

483
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:40,995
What?

484
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:47,668
The pepper isn't too spicy,
but the soup came out really good.

485
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:48,753
Give it a try.

486
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,047
Eat up, honey.

487
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:56,177
Honey, you're not gonna eat?

488
00:34:58,721 --> 00:34:59,847
You should eat first.

489
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:06,270
<i>These two men,</i>
<i>whose whereabouts are currently unknown,</i>

490
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,815
<i>are respectively in their 20s and 30s,</i>

491
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:11,984
<i>and they're both speculated</i>
<i>to have conspired with Song Chon.</i>

492
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:25,206
-Are you okay?
-Son of a bitch! Shit! Shit!

493
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,250
I'm such a fuckin' idiot.

494
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:34,090
No, you're not an idiot.

495
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,635
But that's the reality. 'Cause I'm…

496
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:41,973
I can't do anything
on my own, Roh Bin.

497
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,064
I have a new plan, all right?

498
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:54,569
L… let's go to a warm country.

499
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,613
Warm country?

500
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,449
How, though?

501
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,034
We'll sneak onto a boat.

502
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,036
We'll hide.

503
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,383
It's all so boring.

504
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,344
DENTAL HEALTH, ONE OF THE FIVE BLESSINGS,

505
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,638
HAS ALWAYS BEEN
THE INDICATOR OF YOUR BODY HEALTH

506
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,556
WORLD DENTIST

507
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:10,770
-Kid.
-Hmm?

508
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,773
You can't just keep on
coming here, you know?

509
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,025
We don't have anywhere else to go.

510
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:18,486
Still, you can't keep this up. Come on.

511
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,488
I already paid my debt
last time with the--

512
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,531
Insurance fraud, draft evasion…

513
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:25,117
-And that rich family's son with--
-Yeah, yeah. Okay.

514
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:28,704
I understand what you're saying, okay?
But you can't keep coming here.

515
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:33,042
So tell me,
are you gonna settle down, finally?

516
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:37,338
Well, if you didn't want this to happen,
you should've led a cleaner life.

517
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:41,884
Or you should've updated and managed
your server with all your ledgers.

518
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:43,386
You didn't, though.

519
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:48,057
Yo, so according to the stowaways
that arrived last week…

520
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,183
Mm-hmm?

521
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:53,062
…the Taean route is completely
shut down because of the crackdowns.

522
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:55,856
Yeah, that's because
Taean requires a transfer.

523
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,233
-Mm.
-So…

524
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:01,028
Taking a straight route is best.

525
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:05,074
You know? So we're going here directly
with the speedboat, with no transfer.

526
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:06,867
-Mm.
-So we should be okay.

527
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:10,913
Okay. So, simply put,

528
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,833
back then, we had to travel
all the way here and then transfer,

529
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,501
so it was complicated.

530
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:20,047
But now, you can go on a speedboat
directly from here.

531
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,841
Huh? Much simpler.

532
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,303
How much will it cost us?

533
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:28,431
-Well, the price is great.
-He's using a speedboat now.

534
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:31,392
So you just need
to give him some hazard pay.

535
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,646
Uh… do you have slower boats?

536
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:37,440
-Slower?
-Yeah.

537
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,652
If you try to do that,

538
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,613
you have to transfer,
so that means two boats.

539
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,657
It'll cost twice as much in the end.

540
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,243
-It's a lot more costly.
-Hmm.

541
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:52,538
What do you think?

542
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:54,957
Huh.

543
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:04,759
Hello?

544
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,927
<i>Is this Mr. Jang Nan-gam?</i>

545
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,931
<i>This is Gwangjin Hospital.</i>
<i>You're Mr. Jang Gap-su's guardian, right?</i>

546
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:11,932
Yes.

547
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,393
<i>Your mother isn't</i>
<i>answering the phone right now.</i>

548
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:17,271
<i>I'm calling you</i>
<i>in regards to your decision.</i>

549
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,148
<i>On the DNR?</i>

550
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:23,152
<i>It looks like you and your mother are</i>
<i>the only family members we have on file.</i>

551
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,737
<i>Is that correct?</i>

552
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,405
Yes. What's going on?

553
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:30,576
<i>So, you and your mother have both signed</i>
<i>the necessary paperwork.</i>

554
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:34,497
<i>-We'll process your request and then--</i>
<i>-</i>Excuse me, ma'am. Uh, hold on.

555
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,498
<i>Yes?</i>

556
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,126
My mother signed the paperwork too?

557
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,879
<i>Yes, Miss Shin Jeong-hui signed it.</i>

558
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:45,383
<i>If you've changed your mind,</i>
<i>we have to perform intubation right now.</i>

559
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,928
<i>You have to make the decision</i>
<i>immediately, sir.</i>

560
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,473
<i>Do you want to continue the treatment,</i>
<i>or should we stop?</i>

561
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,892
Um…

562
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,312
<i>Or do you need some time to think it over?</i>

563
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,565
Hmm…

564
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:05,861
<i>Hello?</i>

565
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:07,905
<i>Sir?</i>

566
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,830
Hmm…

567
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,089
Just do it.

568
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,508
<i>Sorry? Do you want us to treat him?</i>

569
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,802
Yes, that's correct.

570
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,472
<i>Okay, I'll let the doctors know,</i>
<i>and we'll proceed.</i>

571
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,126
We just got a signal
on Song Chon's burner phone.

572
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,295
<i>We're tracking his location now.</i>

573
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:49,131
<i>9561, 9651.</i>

574
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,466
<i>Pull over to the side.</i>

575
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:04,688
God. What's this about?
Did I do something wrong?

576
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,482
We need to check your vehicle.

577
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:11,529
-I'm here to deliver materials to a shop.
-Hey, I found something here.

578
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,531
-Really? What is it?
-Huh?

579
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:15,908
Is this not it?

580
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,202
That's the one. It's on, right?

581
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,137
Come again.

<i>Hey, Bin.</i>

585
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:08,544
<i>It's me.</i>

586
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,170
Where ya headed?

587
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:14,258
You know, uh…

588
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,386
…we're all wanted by the cops now, right?

589
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:19,096
And you're my accomplices.

590
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:21,599
Shouldn't we have a meeting
or something like that?

591
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:26,061
<i>Do you really think</i>
<i>that I won't know where you're going?</i>

592
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,106
<i>Come to the factory in Osan.</i>

593
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,191
<i>You know where it is.</i>

594
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:36,822
Oh, I have that book too.
The one that you took.

595
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,204
Who was that?

596
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,625
Uh… it was nothing.

597
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,506
<i>We can't</i>
<i>go on the highway with this car.</i>

598
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,634
<i>The cops will find us instantly.</i>

599
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,552
Shit.

601
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:03,724
A van for the industrial complex
will come in 30 minutes.

602
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,769
You take that
and get off at the destination.

603
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:10,064
It… it'll be a ten-minute walk
to Boryeong Port.

604
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,526
If anyone asks why you're there,
though they probably won't,

605
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,488
you can just tell them
you're there to unload shipments.

606
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,993
What about you? You're not gonna go?

607
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:28,999
It's… Look, we shouldn't go together.
Too much of a risk.

608
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:33,921
I'll take buses and go
on a little detour first. Don't worry.

609
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:38,634
I'm gonna go and check out the bus routes.

-I guess not.

-Yeah. What is it? One of those--

-Yeah--
-I'll figure it out. Thanks.

-Here.
-Thanks.

622
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,996
Wait. One sec.
There should be another one?

623
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:34,875
We still have a lot of time left.
We'll get going later, when it gets dark.

Why won't it open?

Hello.

630
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:35,811
Uh, I think I know
where Song Chon is hiding.

631
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:37,437
So I came here.

632
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,366
Why'd you go to Gajok Construction?

633
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:52,077
And don't try to bullshit me, either.

634
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,290
Just so…
so I could try and catch Song Chon.

635
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:02,671
Who are you to try and catch him?

636
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,007
Hmm?

637
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:08,218
Song Chon, Lee Tang.

638
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:12,180
You used those assholes
just to murder all those people.

639
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:13,473
What's wrong with you?

640
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:18,520
Do you know how many people died
because of your fucked-up ideals?

641
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,650
So I guess you have
a clean conscience, then?

642
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:25,986
What'd you say?

643
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,865
I heard that you let
Chairman Hyeong get killed too.

644
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,452
Wow. So it must be true.

645
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:37,456
Also, I didn't hack the system
to learn that.

646
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:41,919
One of the bodyguards,
he put it up online, anonymously.
