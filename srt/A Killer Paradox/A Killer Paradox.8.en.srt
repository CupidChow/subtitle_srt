00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:13,930
"<i>Tang."</i>

2
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,267
<i>"I don't think I can go with you."</i>

3
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:23,023
I'm sorry I couldn't
tell you the truth in the end.

4
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,483
<i>You'll be fine without me.</i>

5
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,611
You're the one with the skill.

6
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,907
Just do whatever your gut tells you to.

7
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:36,202
If you do that,
everything will work out just fine.

8
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:40,498
<i>I had no choice to begin with.</i>

9
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,792
<i>Life isn't an essay question.</i>

10
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:44,753
<i>It's multiple-choice.</i>

11
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,072
<i>But then again…</i>

12
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,244
<i>maybe everything so far </i>was <i>my choice.</i>

13
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,916
<i>Maybe there is no right answer.</i>

14
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:28,880
<i>And now</i>

15
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,050
<i>I'm about to make another choice.</i>

16
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:37,347
A KILLER PARADOX

17
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,957
-Your mother…
-Hmm?

18
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,208
She's okay.

19
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,627
Thankfully.

20
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,713
She'll regain consciousness soon.

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,799
Hmm.

22
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:20,807
Hey…

23
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,309
We will make sure to

24
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:27,230
take care of, uh… your father's funeral.

25
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:35,113
-Okay.
-So you should go home… and rest.

26
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:44,497
Okay.

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,917
See you.

28
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,940
Yes, sir. Detective Kim!

29
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,026
Did you see Detective Jang?

30
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,652
Why? He just left here.

31
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,779
The boss has been on my ass to find him.

32
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,116
This really isn't the right time.

33
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,703
It's just… he hasn't gone back
to return his firearm yet.

34
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:26,915
So I think…
something could get out of hand.

35
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,139
Where's Song Chon?

36
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,359
Stay low.

37
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,656
Detective Jang.

38
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,034
I don't know what I could possibly say.

39
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,454
I'd be lying if I said
I knew how you feel.

40
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,626
Hey, take it easy.

41
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:15,129
I promise,
I'm going to get this Song Chon.

42
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,756
So don't worry.

43
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,883
Go home and get some rest, okay?

44
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,010
I'll finish up here
and go to the funeral home.

45
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,178
Yes, sir. Thanks.

46
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,973
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'll be fine.

47
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,934
-You want water? I have some in the car.
-No thanks, sir.

48
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,611
Hey! Detective Jang!
Detective Jang! Detective…

49
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,962
What are you gonna do with Song Chon?

50
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,133
DETECTIVE KIM

51
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:04,012
And what are you gonna do
about Tang?

52
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:07,098
Hey, you keep your mouth closed,
or I'll have to kill you first, okay?

53
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,144
HEROES

54
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,693
You know how I told you
that Tang is different?

55
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,070
DETECTIVE KIM

56
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,196
I told you to shut up.

57
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:26,034
Tang is special.
You know it, too, Detective.

58
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,618
Tang leaves no evidence behind.

59
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,537
After I kill Song Chon,
you and Tang are next.

60
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,664
So that's not gonna change anything.

61
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,585
I'll help you catch Song Chon.

62
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,589
I don't care what happens to me, but Tang…

63
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,258
Could you just leave Tang alone?

64
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,390
Hey.

65
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,768
-What's he doing?
-Hey, that's mine!

66
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,062
Stop! Stop!

67
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,033
Ah shit.

68
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:11,871
Oh shit.

69
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,511
All of this happened because of me.

70
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,391
So I have to take responsibility.

71
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,953
EUNSUNG CHICKEN

72
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,135
You know that the people Tang killed
all deserved to die.

73
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,934
<i>Hey.</i>

74
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,395
I was there when he killed Prosecutor Ji.

75
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,647
This video was found
on the prosecutor's phone.

76
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,609
And you know
the high school girl from Daejeon?

77
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,653
It was Prosecutor Ji's doing.

78
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,989
<i>Please let me go.</i>

79
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,212
Are you saying
you two abducted and killed him?

80
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,505
Huh?

81
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,300
-Because you weren't catching him--
-Fucking crazy motherfucker!

82
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,427
You think you're God?

83
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,387
Who are you to choose?

84
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,724
Do you have the right to decide
who deserves to die? Hmm?

85
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,685
And what about you?

86
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:02,482
You're not going after Song Chon as an
officer of the law. You've got a vendetta.

87
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:04,817
Am I wrong?

88
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,780
My father was…

89
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,913
I have a good enough reason for it, huh?

90
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,843
Just listen to me.

91
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,765
Song Chon has nothing left to lose.

92
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:40,811
And after this whole case is over with,
I'll take my punishment.

93
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,650
I have everything
planned out, from A to Z.

94
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,610
So just…

95
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,948
Just, please,
won't you hear me out for once?

96
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:02,833
ROH BIN - ME
OSAN

97
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,925
Don't tell me.

98
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,803
You came alone.

99
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,389
That's no fun.

100
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,475
You should stop now.

101
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,395
I'll do anything you want me to do.

102
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,399
I don't want
anything from you.

103
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:13,529
I know that I'm the only one
who can help you right now.

104
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,489
You know that too.

105
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,200
If I kill you right here,

106
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,621
I'll have just enough time
to go and kill Lee Tang too.

107
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:24,874
Hmm?

108
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,544
What's that noise?

109
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,384
I can hear the gears turning in your head.

110
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,804
It's a lot of fun.

111
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:45,227
Trying to guess what you've got cooking
up there in that, uh… in that noggin.

112
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,981
You're just too predictable.
You know that?

113
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,411
Aah.

114
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:10,002
I was planning to kill Lee Tang
to start with.

115
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,004
Screwed up my order. Hmm.

116
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,423
By the way,

117
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,843
are you two working together?

118
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,685
I knew you would come.

119
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,978
This is earlier than I thought.

120
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,899
Goodness.

121
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:32,858
Right, okay.

122
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:37,363
When you ratted me out last time,
he's the one you told. Am I right?

123
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,408
Yeesh, you little…

124
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,451
Dirty little rat.

125
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,578
He's using you, you know? Huh?

126
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,164
All his life, he's been out to catch me.

127
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,084
-For cracking his dad's skull--
-You mean to kill, not to catch.

128
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,502
Hah.

129
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,039
Nan-gam.

130
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:32,460
Are you really here for revenge
against your ol' <i>ajeossi?</i>

131
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:35,963
You should be thanking me!

132
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,216
He wasn't exactly living the life.

133
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,219
Besides, I put him out of his misery.

134
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,140
You were thinking about
when to put him down, anyway.

135
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,103
You're right.

136
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:54,607
Thank you.

137
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:58,527
So what?

138
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,322
You gonna pull the trigger this time?

139
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,163
You just don't have
the eyes of a killer, kiddo. Huh?

140
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,969
Lee! Lee Tang! Now <i>this </i>is exciting!

141
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,143
Hey, this time, you didn't run away!

142
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,020
The balls on you!

143
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,563
Points for you, champ!

144
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,150
Tang, why are you here?

145
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,653
To end it all.

146
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,034
So let's have
a real grand finale, shall we?

147
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,457
Hey, hey, hey, wait.

148
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,125
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

149
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,752
Hey, punk…

150
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,343
Hey, don't shoot! Don't shoot!

151
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,971
Nan-gam, just wait. Hey!

152
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,766
Hey, shouldn't you be
shooting at him, not me?

153
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,560
You're supposed to be a cop!

154
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,103
Cut it out!

155
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,647
You little… Gah!

156
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,525
Oh, jeez, I can't believe he shot at me.

157
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,135
Farewell… kid.

158
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,930
Oh… oh no…

159
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,980
Didn't you know… it ends like this?

160
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,609
<i>Hyung.</i>

161
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,113
Ah.

162
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,449
Why?

163
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,910
Why? Why did you have to come here?

164
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,081
We could've just…

165
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,126
lived our separate lives.

166
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,675
Because I was needed.

167
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,847
This world,

168
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,308
well, it could really use

169
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,435
people like us.

00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,274
Are you different?

183
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,235
Are you different

184
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,154
from me?

185
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,658
Do you think that you are? Huh?

186
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,412
Are you certain?

187
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,666
Just shut the hell up.

188
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,881
Nan-gam.

189
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,134
What do you…

190
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,138
…think you know that justifies
doing this to me?

191
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,849
What does your mom say?

192
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,642
Your mom…

193
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:47,024
Your mom… wasn't any better.

194
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,234
You wanna tell that disgusting story now?

195
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,821
Right. The station food
can't be good.

196
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:54,656
Oh!

197
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,202
Oh, um, I'll call you back later.

198
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,332
OFFICER ATTACKED AND PARALYZED

199
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,334
BY SUBORDINATE
INVOLVED IN DRUG CORRUPTION?

200
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,711
You have no idea how little I care
about who you slept with.

201
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,588
So just cut the bullshit.

202
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,466
It's pathetic.

203
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,225
Park Gwang-su, it was him!

204
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,019
<i>Your dad's friend!</i>

205
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,940
He's the one she cheated with.

206
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,275
-No.
-You bastard.

207
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:34,279
Do you… think I'm just
some filthy homewrecker?

208
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,534
You're clueless, aren't you?
You little punk.

209
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,329
So go ahead.

210
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:43,997
Shoot.

211
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:45,749
Only,

212
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,751
if I die,

213
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,796
you'll wonder

214
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,590
why your dad was in there.

215
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:57,010
You'll wonder for the rest of your life.

216
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,304
Are you okay with that?

217
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,102
So what do you say?

218
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,688
Should I tell you?

219
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,826
Oh, good evening, sir.

220
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,287
Have some of this.

221
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,204
Thanks.

222
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,457
-Captain.
-Hey.

223
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,376
-How are you?
-Good.

224
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,545
You must be tired.

225
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,882
Detective Jang. Detective Jang.

226
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,675
You must be tired.

227
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,510
You.

228
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,471
Why are you here?
Shouldn't you be working?

229
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:45,851
Uh, the shift starts in two hours.
And the captain said I could join.

230
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:50,564
Stop being a nuisance
and go to work. This isn't a game.

231
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,358
What, you got nothin' else to do?

232
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,945
Well, I… just wanted to help out.

233
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,197
Well, you aren't.

234
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,450
Cut it out. Get lost. Go.

235
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,580
Jeez.

236
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,791
Come on, man.
Can't you be nicer to him?

237
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,378
This stays between us,
but he didn't make it again.

238
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,963
It's like…

239
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,299
it's like
his dead father is holding him back.

240
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,427
Still, you can't call him here.
He's not Violent Crimes.

241
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,513
I mean,
the more the merrier, right?

242
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:39,988
Put your hips in it!

243
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,037
Take it easy. You're not a pro.

244
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:53,877
<i>I did boxing, judo.</i>

245
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,213
DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO TODAY
OR FAIL TO DO IT WHEN YOU NEED

246
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,798
<i>I tried everything I could.</i>

247
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,216
What's the address?

248
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:02,052
<i>And learned everything I could.</i>

249
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,182
Thanks for the meal.

250
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,059
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

251
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,064
Ah, Jesus. What's with that idiot?

252
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,862
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

253
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,573
-I heard you're going back to Yanbian.
-That's right, next week.

254
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,159
That's great.
You'll finally see your kids.

255
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:29,121
It's all thanks to Detective Jang.

256
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,081
Ah.

257
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,167
Yeah, and they kept talking
about that stuff.

258
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:36,670
Uh, Detective Jang?

259
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,089
Hold on.

260
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,049
What is it now?

261
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,968
Uh… I'm sorry. Go ahead, sir.

262
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,221
What? What is it? Just tell me.

263
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,433
Uh, you heard, right?

264
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:52,311
Ms. Hwang from the cafeteria
is going back to Yanbian.

265
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,270
Huh? So?

266
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,939
I thought we'd pool a little cash.

267
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,108
I don't have time for this. Get lost.

268
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,651
Ah. Sir.

269
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,114
Hey!

270
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:07,492
Come here.

271
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:10,871
Yes, sir?

272
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:23,175
Here, give her this. Tell her I'm sorry
I can't give it to her in person.

273
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,886
Wow. Yes, sir!

274
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,059
Everyone at the station pitched in.

275
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,978
Aww! You really didn't have to.

276
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:39,149
Oh, and this. Detective Jang told me
to give this to you.

277
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,694
Aah. This must be
what he was talking about.

278
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,864
What is it? Is it not for you?

279
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,991
Ah, no, it's not mine.

280
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:51,536
He… he asked me to… to go to
China and deliver it to someone.

281
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,497
Ah, I see.

282
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,084
<i>…number of victims</i>

293
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:29,408
He had been pushing massive
amounts of drugs for five years.

294
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,700
Detective Jang.

295
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,202
-Yes? Oh, hello.
-Hello.

296
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:35,872
I know that you had wanted me
to help you and bring this to Mr. Baek,

297
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,291
but I couldn't find the time
to meet him, and--

298
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,251
Ah.

299
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:42,963
He took advantage of that poor,

300
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:47,551
<i>naive lady and was using her</i>
<i>as a drug mule for the Korean-Chinese.</i>

Detective Jang.

303
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,114
Yeah? What?

304
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:14,161
Ms. Hwang is okay, right?
She'll be released soon, right?

305
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,538
What? What about her?

306
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,169
Th… there's no way you'd do
something like that, would you?

307
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,005
Uh, all she did
was work at the cafeteria--

308
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,215
What are you even talking about right now?

309
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,384
Th… this must be a cover, right?

310
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,470
Some big plan to take down a drug ring?

311
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:35,474
She's in on it, and I'm the only one
who wasn't told what's going on, aren't I?

312
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,600
You bastard.

313
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,352
Hey. Have you been drinking?

314
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,812
Huh?

315
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,982
Why would I have been drinking?

316
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,570
For fuck's sake. Come on.

317
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,071
No, no, hang on. Wait.

318
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,574
-You gave me the box to give to Ms. Hwang.
-What box?

319
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,075
-Move, asshole!
-You told me to.

320
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,703
-It was the box on the news!
-What? I never did that.

321
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:57,954
Sir, why are you lying to me?

322
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,123
-What's going on?
-You bastard! Seriously!

323
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,715
Listen.

324
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:09,674
Hey.

325
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,302
Everyone's got their reasons.

326
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,681
Did your father kill people
because he wanted to?

327
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:20,769
Do you want people to point fingers at you
for being the child of a murderer?

328
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:25,524
I saved you
when you were just a starving kid.

329
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,568
And you do this? Huh?

330
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,196
I knew the whole time.

331
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,741
I knew I kept failing my promotion

332
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,161
because you made sure I didn't get it.

333
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,998
But I wanted to think that you…

334
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,376
you maybe had a reason.

335
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,127
-I guess I was wrong.
-Oh.

336
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,338
This again?

337
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,173
You little…

338
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,511
Song Chon, just think about it.

339
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,764
How could the son of a killer, huh,

340
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:01,184
ever be a Violent Crimes detective, huh?

341
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,936
It's okay for a dirty cop to be one?

342
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:07,524
You little shithead.
I'm gonna kill you, I swear.

343
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,109
Fuck's sake!

344
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,404
Get down. Stop it. Down, you little shit!

345
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:15,615
Please, sir, just tell me why. Why?

346
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:17,534
Aah.

347
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,536
Look at you.

348
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:22,330
How did you hide this all along?

349
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,709
Just look at those bloodthirsty eyes.

350
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,461
Son of a killer.

351
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,922
To Jang Gap-su,

352
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:35,051
I was nothing but the son of a killer.

353
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:37,012
Stop. Let go.

354
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,015
-Damn it, let go.
-Stop it, sir.

355
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,266
Let go!

356
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:44,060
-Don't do this.
-I told you, let go. Let go!

357
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:48,565
Please stop.

358
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,609
I see the apple doesn't fall far.

359
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,111
You want to be a killer like your dad?

360
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,453
<i>When I gave him the first blow,</i>

361
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,039
his face said, "What was that?"

362
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:11,713
<i>The second blow,</i>

363
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,049
<i>he looked at me</i>

364
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,885
<i>like I was the bad guy.</i>

365
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,013
<i>The third blow,</i>

366
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,224
<i>that's when he started screaming.</i>

367
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,269
<i>After the fourth blow,</i>

368
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:31,900
<i>he seemed to finally realize</i>
<i>that he was in trouble.</i>

369
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,736
<i>That disgusted me.</i>

370
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:36,571
<i>So I gave him</i>

371
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,156
the fifth blow.

372
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,033
And then the sixth.

373
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,744
And finally, the seventh.

374
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:48,750
OFFICER ATTACKED AND PARALYZED

375
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,418
METHAMPHETAMINE SMUGGLER
TAKES OWN LIFE

376
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,920
<i>And now, here we are.</i>

377
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,673
Don't you get it yet?

378
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,551
So why would you take revenge?

379
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:02,555
If anyone, I'm the one who should have it.

380
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,104
Oh, Nan-gam, I pity you, kid.

381
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,356
Ah. Ugh…

382
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,817
Your father was…

383
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,529
a corrupt cop.

384
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:19,322
Your mother…

385
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,743
was obscene, a depraved cheater.

386
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,386
Let me finish him.

387
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:48,518
So you think you're God?

388
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,104
You've…

389
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,899
never killed someone.

390
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:01,698
-Ah. One last thing…
-Aren't you just as bad as he is?

391
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:05,285
-If you aren't certain either, then…
-But you should be different.

392
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,165
…you should die too.

393
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,303
It's not…

394
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:09,974
easy to kill.

395
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:13,186
Until you get used to it.

396
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,774
It's all over now.

397
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,115
I won't run away again.

398
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:32,705
CRIME AND PUNISHMENT

399
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:38,354
Captain Jang Gap-su, you were
a proud member of the police force.

400
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,981
INSPECTOR JANG GAP-SU'S FUNERAL CEREMONY

401
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:43,985
Ever since you joined us,
you have worked hard and diligently,

402
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,154
making an example for others to follow.

403
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:49,032
You were a loyal friend
to your fellow officers

404
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,575
and always put others first.

405
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,703
You were a true police officer

406
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,997
who carried out his duty without fail,

407
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,708
and who put people's lives
and safety first,

408
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,460
even when your own was in danger.

409
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:07,175
Today, we mourn the loss
of a great and competent officer.

410
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,930
However, we will not forget you.

411
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,266
You will always be in our hearts.

412
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,728
We will continue to honor your spirit,

413
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:22,565
in our work as police officers ourselves.

414
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:28,905
I was unconscious for three days
after the brain surgery.

415
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,783
I'm still unable to move my head.

416
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:37,246
This is a subarachnoid hemorrhage, okay?

417
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:41,626
I have recovered a lot in just ten days
in here. Not everyone does.

418
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:47,465
I'm just saying that some people can take
several years to ever fully recover.

419
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:54,305
According to my doctor,
I have my fitness regimen to, uh… thank…

420
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,774
So why are you here?

421
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,779
-Me?
-Yeah.

422
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,116
You're here for a reason, aren't you?

423
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,203
Hey, I'm just here to visit, all right?

424
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,376
That's nice.

425
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:26,629
By the way,

426
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,340
the nurse is super cute, right?

427
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:32,510
Just saying,

428
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,388
she's been especially kind to me.

429
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:43,563
That's why I'm gonna
ask her out when I get out.

430
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,232
What are you gonna say
when you ask her out?

431
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,943
"I'm actually a detective."

432
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,738
"A Violent Crimes detective."

433
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,990
"I was injured
while going after a criminal,

434
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,535
and I'll catch the guy
when I get discharged."

435
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,245
So, yeah.

436
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:03,958
-Be sure to give us the full report, okay?
-Sure. So, How do you think it'll go?

437
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,962
I think she'll say yes.

438
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:21,434
You didn't file an appeal
for your suspension in the end.

439
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,937
I did something wrong.
I should be punished for it.

440
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,357
I don't understand.

441
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,651
-You could've said it was self-defense--
-Just…

442
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,905
Please just cut to the chase.

443
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:36,824
Okay, then.

444
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,996
Hmm. I'll try to make it brief for you.

445
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:45,917
Did he seem like
the sort of person who'd do that?

446
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:52,006
I thought it was the profiler's job
to figure out that sort of thing?

447
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,469
I'm only following standard protocol.

448
00:34:57,303 --> 00:35:00,640
We have the evidence.
Your statement has to line up.

449
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:05,520
If you have evidence in front of you,
maybe you should trust that.

450
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,649
So what's the conclusion, then?

451
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,823
This is our conclusion.

452
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:20,368
<i>Song Chon has been</i>
<i>on the run after killing 30 people</i>

453
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,662
<i>and two police officers</i>
<i>over the past five years.</i>

454
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:25,123
POLICE BRIEFING ON THE APPREHENSION
OF SERIAL KILLER SONG CHON

455
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:29,127
<i>After a long pursuit,</i>
<i>we found him and eliminated him.</i>

456
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,672
<i>His accomplice and co-conspirator,</i>
<i>Roh Bin,</i>

457
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,507
who helped Song Chon

458
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,051
and murdered five victims,

459
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,304
including Prosecutor Ji,
Professor No and Gyeong-bae,

460
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:44,392
was also eliminated at the scene.

461
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:48,437
Ron Bin's incriminating evidence,
the alibi, and circumstances.

462
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,022
They all fit perfectly.

463
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:54,277
<i>We found evidence that he researched</i>
<i>his victims for a long time.</i>

464
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,029
<i>All of the murders were planned</i>
<i>by Roh Bin.</i>

465
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,450
To be able to close a case like this,
you must have a culprit.

466
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:05,413
<i>We found a large number</i>
<i>of what we suspect to be murder weapons</i>

467
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,831
<i>in Roh Bin's storage room.</i>

468
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,627
<i>And… I'm the one</i>
<i>who knows about all the cases.</i>

469
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:12,587
<i>So,</i>

470
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,548
<i>let me be the one to finish it.</i>

471
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,052
He's much more meticulous
than he seems.

472
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,848
How did he leave no prints?

473
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,892
Spotless crime scenes. It's striking.

474
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:30,396
But… we did find one decisive clue.

475
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,482
<i>No matter how careful you are,</i>
<i>you're bound to make a mistake.</i>

476
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,694
Fortunately, or…

477
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,238
Really, it's a bit unfortunate.

478
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,741
<i>There was a heavy rain on that day,</i>

479
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,410
<i>so we couldn't find any DNA evidence.</i>

480
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,997
<i>But ironically, he left his teeth marks.</i>

481
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,750
On the day Song Chon died,

482
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:57,465
<i>I couldn't find much, with the suspect's</i>
<i>body completely burnt up.</i>

483
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,552
<i>But there was something</i>
<i>that could be recovered.</i>

484
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,306
Roh Bin's molars.

485
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,309
Uh…
I don't know if this'll work.

486
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,354
Uh, I've never done this.

487
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,606
Only you can make this happen.

488
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:20,196
<i>Roh Bin's teeth alignment is</i>
<i>very similar to Professor No's murderer.</i>

489
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:26,535
Let's say everything goes as you plan.
What do you get in return?

490
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,414
Justice.

491
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:37,213
I'm probably gonna die.

492
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,465
I'm a little afraid.

493
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:44,595
But I guess
that having a reliable sidekick like me

494
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,431
is part of Tang's powers.

495
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,727
Why do you think Roh Bin did this?

496
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,608
What made him so confident in what he did?

497
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,571
Hmm.

498
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,908
<i>From a profiler's perspective,</i>

499
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,413
<i>he's the type who can't differentiate</i>
<i>between reality and fantasy.</i>

500
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,125
<i>A megalomaniac who wanted to be a god.</i>

501
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:18,462
It's plausible that he was
stunted in his emotional development

502
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,006
as a child and young man.

503
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,508
This was most likely due to abuse.

504
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:23,968
Emotional abuse, that is,

505
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:27,263
at the hands of those around him
after his parents' tragic death.

506
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,140
Great, thank you.

507
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,933
We need to make some adjustments.

508
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,144
-We'll start again in a minute.
-Thank you, miss.

509
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,856
Hey, listen, sir, regarding the questions
in the interview we did earlier…

510
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:39,233
<i>I actually have</i>
<i>a question for you.</i>

511
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:40,985
What is it?

512
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,154
It's about your statement.

513
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:48,326
Do you think that Roh Bin was
remotely capable of doing this on his own?

514
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,252
And the one
that you were attempting to get, Lee Tang.

515
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:03,341
He was indeed at the club
and also in Busan.

516
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:08,596
It's just, we never could find
anything to incriminate him, so…

517
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,310
Well, do you think
this is also a coincidence?

518
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,443
When Song Chon and Roh Bin died,

519
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,530
was Lee Tang there?

520
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:31,452
You.

521
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,122
Why did you have to come back here?

522
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,009
I thought it would never end.

523
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,306
If I, um…

524
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,435
didn't finish what I started…

525
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,067
and do it with my own hands,

526
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:09,448
I thought that this would never end.

527
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,054
This is the choice I'm making.

528
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,985
No one will acknowledge you
for doing this, you know?

529
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,243
You're right.

530
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,123
Justice that no one acknowledges…

531
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,501
isn't justice.

532
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,346
I'm done running away.

533
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:50,966
Was this your luck again?

534
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,636
Lee Tang.

535
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,432
Do you really think that you're different

536
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,060
because of your dumb luck?

537
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,536
Do whatever you want.

538
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:23,290
Just like that bastard planned,

539
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:26,961
you can run away or turn yourself in.

540
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,587
It's really up to you now.

541
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:37,846
But…

542
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,142
you'll get caught at some point.

543
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,770
Even if it's not by me.

544
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:31,919
CRIME AND PUNISHMENT

545
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,739
-You're in charge of this place?
-Yes.

546
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:03,450
Okay.
Well, how do you think the fire started?

547
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:08,497
Oh, well, we haven't used
this factory in years, so…

548
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,415
Right.

549
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,458
If it had been raining and humid,

550
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,752
and maybe someone had turned the power on,

551
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:17,339
then there could've been an arc
that could've led to a short.

552
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:22,803
Sir, when was the last time
you did an inspection on this place?

553
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,471
Right, so…

554
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,082
Okay.

555
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,919
Goodness, it's cold.

556
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:59,923
Ah, he should've come to church
instead of shoveling.

557
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:04,470
Hey, you're home.

558
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:07,014
Listen, if you were going
to shovel the snow,

559
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,224
you could've come to church instead.

560
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,728
-Oh, did it snow?
-You…

561
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:13,729
Uh…

562
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,147
<i>All actions have consequences.</i>

563
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,484
<i>Justice above the law?</i>

564
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,821
<i>No matter how just the action is,</i>

565
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:07,699
<i>you must face the consequences</i>
<i>within the boundaries of the law,</i>

566
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:09,910
<i>one way or another.</i>

567
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,412
Nan-gam is an idiot.

568
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,998
He quit being a detective
to avenge his father.

569
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:20,337
He'd be better off
if he stayed put like I did.

570
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:23,340
That again, huh? I don't wanna hear it.

571
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,759
Talk about something else.

572
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:29,137
-I don't have anything else to talk about.
-Dong-u, you need to eat.

573
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,932
-Sit properly. Closer, okay?
-Absolutely nothin'.

574
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:32,891
Scooch in.

575
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,143
This is why you always spill food.

576
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:37,813
Eat up. Aah!

577
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:42,150
-Here, try some of this.
-This place is boring.

578
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,861
It's so peaceful around here.

579
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,656
-Is it expensive to ride them?
-Probably.

580
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:50,701
-You're right. Must be.
-Dong-u. Stop running! Come here.

581
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:51,618
Here.

582
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:55,247
Why are you running off alone?
You startled me.

583
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:56,999
Hmm?

584
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,794
Honey, what's wrong?

585
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,513
What is it?

586
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:14,558
Nothing.

587
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,770
What's with you, huh?

588
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:22,733
<i>I'm doing really well.</i>

589
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,529
<i>But I don't think</i>
<i>I can come back right now.</i>

590
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,620
<i>I don't think I can handle</i>…

591
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,790
<i>the things that I've done</i>

592
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,043
<i>or the things that'll happen.</i>

593
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,257
That's it. That's it.

594
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:49,051
Okay, that's fine.

595
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,957
Hi, sir. Excuse me.
Where are you from?

596
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,589
Can I see your passport?

597
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,604
Hey, Chinese.

598
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:45,023
Hey! Come here!

599
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,191
Come here!

600
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:57,703
An illegal stay, a fake passport.

601
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:00,580
You here to gamble?

602
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,082
That's not it.

603
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:06,086
Then why are you here?
It doesn't look like you're here to work.

604
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:12,050
People don't often come here illegally,
you know.

605
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:14,761
You haven't committed any crimes.

606
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:16,847
Your records are clean.

607
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:20,100
So why go through the trouble
of stowing away?

608
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:23,687
Huh?

609
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:25,772
All right. See ya.

610
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:28,984
Ah.

611
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:30,610
Lieutenant Lee.

612
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:32,654
Yes, sir?

613
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:36,491
Did you find anything out of the ordinary
or significant in there?

614
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,618
Not sure.

615
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:41,329
I just don't want to drag this thing out.

616
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:44,249
The news and YouTubers are
all whipping up these stories

617
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:45,667
like this is some kind of movie.

618
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:51,339
It'd be best for us if we wrapped
this one up neatly and quickly, hmm?

619
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:55,302
-You hear what I'm saying?
-Yeah, well, it won't take too long.

620
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,345
-You sure?
-Yeah.

621
00:50:58,138 --> 00:50:59,514
Of course. Mm.

622
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:02,434
<i>I couldn't find any trace</i>
<i>of Lee Tang anywhere.</i>

623
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:07,355
Which is why
your statement is so important.

624
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:11,318
Depending on what you say,
Lee Tang becomes our lead suspect.

625
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,363
Do you suppose, then,

626
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:20,160
that he might have something to do,
then, with this case in any way?

627
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:47,979
PROSECUTOR AN SE-SEUNG

628
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:51,233
CASE RECORDS AND NON-INDICTMENT DECISION

629
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:52,984
SUSPECT: LEE TANG
CHARGE: MURDER

630
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:55,195
DECISION: DISMISSED (LACK OF EVIDENCE)

631
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:19,636
SOUTH KOREA

632
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:03,597
How much?

633
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:06,850
-Two packs of gum.
-<i>Breaking news.</i>

634
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:09,686
-Give me a second.
<i>-Kim was found dead last month.</i>

635
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:13,607
-Let's see. For two, it's 3,000 won.
<i>-He was the prime suspect in a murder.</i>

636
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,942
<i>It occurred three years ago</i>
<i>in Danyang, Chungbuk.</i>

637
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:20,238
<i>When identifying Kim, the police</i>
<i>found irregularities in his records,</i>

638
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:22,199
<i>and after a subsequent investigation,</i>

639
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:25,285
<i>Kim's DNA was studied and found</i>
<i>to match the genetic material</i>

640
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:28,205
<i>of the prime suspect</i>
<i>in the abduction and murder case</i>

641
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:30,332
<i>in Danyang, Chungbuk, three years ago.</i>

642
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:32,834
<i>It's beginning to look like</i>
<i>a string of subsequent murders</i>

643
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:34,127
<i>may also be linked…</i>

644
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:38,340
-Hey, it's been so long.
-Hey, long time no see, man.

645
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,717
Yeah, how you doin'?

646
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:43,470
Oh. I'm sorry.
