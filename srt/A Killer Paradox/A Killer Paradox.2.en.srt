1
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:34,993
<i>Oh.</i>

2
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,829
<i>A dog shit dream.</i>

3
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:03,605
A KILLER PARADOX

4
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,905
My goodness!

5
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:14,324
How can you scare your mom,
sneaking around like that?

6
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,409
What are you doing here?
You didn't mention…

7
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,328
Well, since you're here,
go throw this away.

8
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:22,290
Oh, did you come over to eat?
I don't have anything prepared.

9
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,542
-Are you going somewhere?
-I'm going to church.

10
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,337
Oh, speaking of which,
do you want to tag along?

11
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,672
Oh, no, no.
Actually, I'd prefer to go alone.

12
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,550
When Yeong comes back,
just order some takeout with her.

13
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,026
Are you serious?

14
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,279
Really? He actually said that to you?

15
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:57,325
How could he say something like that
when he's the one that cheated?

16
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,744
You should've pulled out all his hair
and humiliated him.

17
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,246
You can't just let him be.

18
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:02,831
You have to dump him.

19
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,625
-That asshole deserves a good pruning.
-Excuse me.

20
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,919
-Why tell me this now?
-Excuse me.

21
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,671
Sorry, one sec. Customer.

22
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:10,630
Yeah?

23
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,006
What's the price?

24
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,716
The small ones are 30,000 won,

25
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,052
the big ones 50,000,
the medium ones 40,000.

26
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,346
-Pots, 6,000. Tell me when you decide.
-Which is small?

27
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,430
-What?
-I mean…

28
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,807
Three years?

29
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,643
Oh! Oh, my goodness.

30
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:27,021
How could he do this
behind your back for three years?

31
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,232
You're an idiot.

32
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,651
How can you not notice
that for three years?

33
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,404
Oh, welcome.

34
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,197
Hey, uh, do you have one of those

35
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,449
juice gift sets?

36
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,701
The box with handles?

37
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:42,036
PREMIUM JUICE SET

38
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,957
Sir, could you get me a new one?
This one is really dusty.

39
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,923
Yeah, I'll go grab a new one.

40
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,551
Picky bastard.

41
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,273
You could've put the trash in the bin.

42
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,277
Next time you come,
at least buy some flowers.

43
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,403
He's your dad.

44
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,240
It's not like you come every day.

45
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,659
You only get one father.

46
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:06,246
-For goodness' sake.
-Father never cared for flowers. Hmm?

47
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,749
The only one he liked was
the hibiscus on his rank insignia.

48
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,344
I'm gonna go.

49
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,348
Why even bother coming?

50
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,435
Have you been losing weight?

51
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,481
Hey. Have you been skipping school
and drinking again?

52
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,066
What are you saying?

53
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,320
Listen, you really can't slack off
on any of your studies right now.

54
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,322
Not because of your working holiday.

55
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:45,535
You were just like this before too.
Up until you joined the army, that is.

56
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,579
Oh, are you going to college
just to get kicked out? Huh?

57
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,622
-Unbelie--
-Hello.

58
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,625
Oh, hi, hi, hi!
Hello. Hi. Good to see you.

59
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,877
I don't even want to think
about those days.

60
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,130
You're not that young anymore.
You're grown.

61
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,965
-Don't be so--
-It's not what you think.

62
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,302
And I can always retake the classes
and get the credits.

63
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,513
Do you think I don't know that
because I didn't go to college?

64
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,598
Hey! If you're going to retake classes,

65
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,560
that costs double the normal amount,
doesn't it?

66
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,770
Yeah. If you get two academic
probations, you're out.

67
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,731
-Oh! Deacon Kim.
-Right? And you are…

68
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,025
Oh, hi. Hello!

69
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,944
-You look so lovely!
-Oh, I do? Ah!

70
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,488
-Aah!
-Yeah, thank you. So do you.

71
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,158
And this must be Tang.

72
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,576
You should say hello.

73
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,202
Oh gosh. He's tall.

74
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,955
And what about Yeong's wedding?
It's tough, right?

75
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,792
Oh, well, I've taken care of the stuff
that was complicated for her already.

76
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:38,796
I'm just getting the two of them a small
apartment, so they can take it easy.

77
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,758
This one's all grown up, too,
and he's going abroad soon.

78
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,217
-Wow. Really?
-Yeah.

79
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,636
-Where?
-Australia, in fact. Honey, come on!

80
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,221
That's great news!

81
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,765
-Hello!
-Oh, hello.

82
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:52,226
Because Jesus Christ was crucified
on the cross, we are now saved…

83
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,607
Listen, when your father retires, we can
live off his pension, as small as it is.

84
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,568
So don't worry. Just go and work hard.

85
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,820
…we know what it is to do good…

86
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:08,117
We can't afford to help you study abroad
like some other parents would be able to.

87
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,912
But we won't burden our kids.

88
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,208
Understand?

89
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,544
Hold onto this.

90
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,504
LOTTERY TICKET

91
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,255
-Don't ever smoke marijuana.
-Jeez.

92
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,258
And wear condoms. Stay safe.

93
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,968
-All right?
-All right.

94
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,012
He is the salt of the earth.

95
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,807
Ah! Listen, did you hear about the guy
who was killed

96
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,393
near the convenience store
that you work at?

97
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,269
…life of grace and mercy…

98
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:38,398
Oh, honestly, he had it coming.

99
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,025
It was God's retribution, surely.

100
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,946
Oh, how could such a thing happen?
Goodness.

101
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,248
Why are you all standin' around?

102
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,668
We're getting heat
for not catching Yeo Bu-il before he died.

103
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:03,005
The bosses are givin' us crap about
arrest numbers goin' down for cold cases.

104
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,968
And the chief called up the captain,
so we're all walkin' on thin ice.

105
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:10,930
-Why is everyone standing around?
-Well, we're gettin' some heat for, uh…

106
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:17,311
You jerk. Why are you buyin' us coffee
when you get paid peanuts?

107
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,189
-Seriously. Come on…
-It's fine, sir. Have some. No?

108
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,066
Have some coffee, here.

109
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,068
-Great work, everyone.
-Ah. Thank you.

110
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,778
There's one for everybody.

111
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,822
-Here you go. Did you all get one?
-Hey.

112
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,198
-Come here…
-Sir?

113
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,451
You keep goin' back to see that cute girl.

114
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,786
Is she cute? I hadn't noticed.

115
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,248
-We'll sing at your wedding.
-You got it wrong. It's not like that.

116
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,875
-What are you naming your kid?
-Uh, sir.

117
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,293
-Sir.
-Hello, sir.

118
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,878
-Oh.
-Hello, sir.

119
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,172
You all heard, huh?

120
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:45,590
Sir…

121
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,343
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

122
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,053
Get it together, everyone.

123
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,973
Don't wait until next month
to get started.

124
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,850
Start getting ready now.

125
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:59,770
Use this opportunity,
and get those awards and promotions, huh?

126
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,105
-Yes, sir.
-Yep.

127
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,732
Okay, then get to work.

128
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,983
-Sir.
-Yes, sir.

129
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,777
-Hey. Detective Jang.
-Yeah?

130
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,281
Look, you need to stop
fixating on that guy.

131
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,492
-Don't try to be a lone wolf.
-I'm not fixating.

132
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,951
-What's that about?
-Come on.

133
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:17,163
-I got it.
-Well, there was a guy we couldn't catch.

134
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,372
Who was he?

135
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,500
A cop, just like you.

136
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,921
A cop? A cop on the run? Whoa.

137
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,756
-That's messed up.
-Eh, well.

138
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,468
Every detective has that one perp
they want to catch more than anything.

139
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,345
-Ahem. Detective An.
-Yes, sir.

140
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,639
We have a simple saying.

141
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:39,435
Being a detective here is like
riding on top of a really thin line.

142
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,770
Mm.

143
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,981
It's fine if you can
keep your balance on it.

144
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,567
But if you were to slip,

145
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,278
you go back to an average citizen.

146
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,364
-Mm-hmm.
-If you're lucky.

147
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,574
But if you fall on the other side,
that means prison.

148
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,285
If you don't wanna go to prison,

149
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,079
you run away.

150
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,915
That's how it goes in this life.

151
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:02,959
Here you go.

152
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,213
Feel free to reach out
if you have any issues.

153
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,592
You're all set.

154
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:13,427
Thank you.

155
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,142
<i>Have a good day.</i>

156
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:27,817
<i>Have a good day.</i>

157
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,779
<i>Have a good day.</i>

158
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,700
<i>Have a good day.</i>

159
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,162
What are you doing?

160
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,123
Oh.

161
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,501
It's the… The door seems misaligned.

162
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,629
Jeez.

163
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,673
Don't you just hate that sound?

164
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,884
All that "Have a good day!
Have a good day!"

165
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,636
whenever anyone comes or goes.

166
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,723
It's like it'll kill us
if we don't have a good day.

167
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,935
If that thing breaks,
you'll know the reason.

168
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,814
The manager is psycho
for keeping that thing.

169
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,151
Huh?

170
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,903
-Yeah, the… the manager totally is--
-Yes! Time to go.

171
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,623
<i>Have a good day.</i>

172
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:29,962
Shit.

173
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,798
Hello.

174
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,301
Let me know if you need anything.

175
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,845
Can I get a pack of Raison French?

176
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,013
Raison…

177
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,608
Hmm. Mm!

178
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,820
Oh, also,

179
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,114
two million won.

180
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,617
What?

181
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,411
You need to give me two million won.

182
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,164
Hmm? In cash, that is.

183
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,793
Um…

184
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,544
I don't understand.

185
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,133
You look stunned!

186
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,428
You know me, don't you?

187
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:23,933
Huh?

188
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,018
You should.

189
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,522
Do you know me?

190
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,484
Ugh, the fuck is wrong with everyone?

191
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,113
What they see is all they care about.

192
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,155
Look.

193
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:41,659
These.

194
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,329
You think I'm blind, don't you, huh?

195
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,501
But I can still see a bit, you know.

196
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,302
So how was it? Huh?

197
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,221
To murder that guy.

198
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,059
Aah!

199
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,978
Ah, never mind that. Uh…

200
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,231
How much do you make
from working here, then? Huh?

201
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,399
Do you make anything?

202
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:19,947
It's like I'm talkin'
to a fuckin' brick wall.

203
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,450
Oh!

204
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:26,620
Hmm. It must be so easy to dox you
with such a unique name.

205
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,039
Anyway…

206
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,084
Uh, think about it, okay?

207
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,544
Two million.

208
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,463
<i>Have a good day.</i>

209
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,260
Oh, by the way,

210
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,889
I'm not seeing any hammers, huh?

211
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,268
Anyway, please have it ready by tomorrow.

212
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,105
<i>Have a good day.</i>

213
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,065
<i>Have a good day.</i>
<i>Have a good day.</i>

214
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,443
<i>Have a good day. Have a good day…</i>

215
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,002
-Bye!
-See you!

216
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,131
-I'm wearing tiger boxers today.
-Jesus.

217
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,175
-With a giant tiger face.
-So what? I'm busy.

218
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,302
Besides, I have to study for that test.

219
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,888
-Where are you going to study?
-Someplace quiet.

220
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:29,767
-Someplace quiet?
-Hey, listen. Tang called me earlier.

221
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,853
-What'd he say?
-He asked if he could borrow some cash.

222
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,481
That bastard must have gone crazy.

223
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,566
He texted me the same exact thing.

224
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,443
-It's so weird.
-Yeah.

225
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,405
-Should the three of us talk about it?
-With Tang?

226
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,407
With the tiger.

227
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,747
Fucking shit!

228
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,085
I've never seen
anyone ask for a refund for a phone.

229
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,965
I mean, it's not like
the phone has issues.

230
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:05,594
You took the screen protector off too.
There's nothing I can do for you.

231
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,056
You can pay
for the phone in full

232
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,475
and resell it as used to somebody else.

233
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,563
People do it all the time.
That's all I can suggest.

Why are you here at this hour?

240
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,129
Well…

241
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,465
I, uh, forgot to tell you
something yesterday.

242
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,010
Go ahead. What is it, hmm?

243
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,887
-You quitting?
-Huh?

244
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,931
-Uh, no, that's not it.
-What is it, then?

245
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,560
Uh… I have a situation.

246
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,105
I was wondering
if you could pay me in advance.

247
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,982
-For the whole month.
-Oh, gosh.

248
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:04,486
Hey, do you remember the guy
who worked all my overnights last year?

249
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,281
Oh? Remember what happened
after I paid him in advance?

250
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,700
He gambled all the money away
and disappeared.

251
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,036
It was a complete nightmare to deal with.

252
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,371
I spent six months
trying to catch that guy.

253
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,333
I've never paid anyone
in advance ever since then.

254
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,709
You get it, huh?

255
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:23,505
-I'm being honest with you without--
-Yeah, I… I understand. I really do.

256
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,383
-But that's not me.
-Come on.

257
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,844
You know how I work.

258
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,972
No means no, huh? It's not happening.

Do you know how expensive
your rent is? Hmm?

269
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,049
It's not like the school is that far.

270
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,801
You keep going back and forth…

271
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,012
What the… Tang!

272
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,309
The longer you have this type of account,
the better it is.

273
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,894

00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,660
Okay, then.

00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,375

Have a good one.

00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,675
Bye.

00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:58,892

What the heck?

291
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,226
Jeez.

292
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,065
Hello, sir. What are you doing?

293
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,649
It's not making the sound.

294
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,777
-Damn it.
-I wonder why.

295
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,614
What are you doing with that bag?
You're working.

296
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,785
Ah, I see. You getting ready to leave?
It's way too early.

297
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,036
No.

298
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,122
You're not gambling
with that money I gave you?

299
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,541
-What's in there?
-What? Oh, no way.

300
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,835
-Better not.
-Okay.

301
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,796
-You're early today.
-Listen.

302
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:12,174
I saw this weird woman
on my way over here.

303
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,052
She creeped me out.
She's blind, I thought.

304
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,805
Only it felt like she was staring.

305
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:21,850
And she was just standing there all alone,
her head turning to the side and back.

306
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,685
So fucking creepy.

307
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,188

00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,284
Just focus on your life.

313
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,911
Stop trying to get this guy.

314
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,873
Stop trying to get vengeance
for what happened to your father.

315
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,833
-It won't do you any good to obsess--
-Vengeance?

316
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,794
Why would I try to avenge my father?
I'm not some teenager.

317
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,046
All right, you disrespectful son of a--

318
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,465
You wanted us to catch
guys with suspended charges.

319
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,843
-So I'm reviewing these to get promoted.
-You punk.

320
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:41,680
Just 'cause I've known you since you were
a kid, doesn't mean you can talk back…

321
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,725
Hah!

322
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,728
Ah, jeez. You've gotten
so soft in your golden years.

323
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,480
-You little…
-I don't even wanna dodge that.

324
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,399
Hello, sir.

325
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,694
Hey. Please make sure you eat.

326
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,405
And this clock is dead, by the way.

327
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,199
See you later, sir.

328
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,170
-<i>You excited?</i>
-<i>I don't know.</i>

329
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,672
<i>They don't look like they're cut out</i>
<i>for this sort of training.</i>

330
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,383
Did I keep you waiting?

331
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,512
Hey!

332
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,182
You can change the channel
if you really want.

333
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,187
That's actually the only show I watch.
You know why?

334
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:35,651
I watch it because dogs can't lie.

335
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:39,446
Individuals,
on the other hand, I just…

336
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:40,405
Ugh.

337
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,449
<i>He bared his teeth and barked.</i>

338
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:43,784
<i>Then he pounced.</i>

339
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:44,826
So, uh…

340
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,912
How was it, huh?

341
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,705
<i>For all animal lovers…</i>

342
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,958
You seemed a bit nervous.

343
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:53,543
Here you go.

344
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,213
That's my only cup in the house.

345
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:59,007
It's expensive coffee, though,
so it should taste good.

346
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,428
I've just been watching you to…

347
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,974
to find out if you're
a person I can trust or not.

348
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,311
Have you noticed? Huh?

349
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:12,980
Look!

350
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,733
I've been carrying on
a conversation all alone here. Huh?

351
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,862
If you keep acting like this,
like you're mute,

352
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,240
how do you think that makes me feel?

353
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,702
Then again,

354
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,578
I guess that's fair.

355
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,123
I was acting like I couldn't see.

356
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,043
Seriously, though,

357
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,422
I was genuinely shocked that night.

358
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,091
Just think about it, huh?

359
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:45,929
I take night walks because I hate people,
and then I saw one dead.

360
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,932
Then, and

361
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,685
once again when I watched the news.

362
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:52,769
Hmm.

363
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,855
By the way, uh…

364
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,734
did you kill the other guy too?

365
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,612
N-no.

366
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,032
I-I didn't.

367
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:06,658
Huh.

368
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,661
Now you speak.

369
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,582
That's what I thought.

370
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,217
Hmm.

371
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,307
Show me the cash, huh?

372
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,729
Ah.

373
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,025
Ah. Two million. Well done.

374
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,696
-Could you stack them up for me again?
-Okay.

375
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:50,702
So, you're gonna
keep quiet about it, right?

376
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,455
Hmm, sure will. Mm.

377
00:22:56,958 --> 00:23:01,004
So, um, I give you this,
and we have a deal then, right?

378
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,715
Yeah, yeah, of course.

379
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,344
Oh, I'm sure you remember,

380
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,012
but it's every month, okay?

381
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,764
Two million.

382
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,266
Huh?

383
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:17,604
-Wait. You never said that.
-Sure I did.

384
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,524
I mean, isn't it obvious?

385
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,151
Don't you have any common sense?

386
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,028
For fuck's sake.

387
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,365
I mean, are you crazy?

388
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,242
What?

389
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,661
I'm asking if you're crazy.

390
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,580
Oh, come on, man.
You're making me an accomplice here.

391
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,798
Who would do something
this dangerous for two million?

392
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:46,967
Huh?

393
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,053
Pay me at the end of every month.

394
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,264
Actually, your payday works fine for me.

395
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,182
We can figure out the details later.

396
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,312
Oh, and bring 50,000 won bills next time.

397
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:07,988
Oh!
My dog Rex just had to bring this home,

398
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:11,241
when I was fucking annoyed already
because of the rain!

399
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:12,617
Aww.

400
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,120
That's just how Rex is.

401
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,706
He's always so curious.

402
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:21,001
He's always bringing stuff home
and wandering off somewhere.

403
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,127
Huh!

404
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,716
That's why he couldn't
make it as a seeing-eye dog.

405
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,552
They said I wasn't blind
enough to apply for one anyway.

406
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,430
So, we're like this little, uh, shitty…

407
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,058
…pair, or somethin'.

408
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,145
Duet? Oh!

409
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,897
Look at us! A trio now!

410
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,065
What do you say?

411
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,489
That was just a joke.

412
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,032
You should laugh.

413
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:53,950
Oh!

414
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,871
Listen.

415
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,458
Folks get angry…

416
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,921
when they stop getting paid, don't they?

417
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:11,426
When that happens, well…
what would you do, huh?

418
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,846
You'd go and speak to your boss.

419
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:19,184
But then, what's the point, really?

420
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:22,979
It's better to report your boss
to the Labor Administration.

421
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:29,277
Only, for me, it would be the police,
not the Labor Administration.

422
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,529
Oh!

423
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,615
I'll give you two million won.

424
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,243
But I'm taking this.

425
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,872
Lee Tang, class of 2024 at Usang.

426
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,500
I mean, it's a shithole,
but it's not jail.

427
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:47,087
What, do you wanna ruin
your sweet sister's wedding?

428
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,713
Oh, and what was it?

429
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:52,092
Oh yeah. Your mom goes
to Daeseok Church, doesn't she, though?

430
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,301
Oh.

431
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:58,765
Well, then, I guess she won't be able
to go to that church anymore.

432
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,531
Oh…

433
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,538
Honey.

434
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,833
I'm talking to you, huh?

435
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,920
Do you think that taking that
changes things?

436
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,548
No, it will make things worse.

437
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,801
What's the word? Oh, forensic science. Oh!

438
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:38,138
Forensic science is so thorough nowadays.

439
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,434
I know that your DNA is
all over my house already.

440
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:46,313
You know that if I testify
and the cops look your way,

441
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,649
they'll turn your house
upside down in a second.

442
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:53,153
I mean, then, it'll be game over in days.

443
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,990
I know a thing or two about this.
Involuntary manslaughter.

444
00:26:57,073 --> 00:27:00,744
Even if that's the only charge,
you'll get put away for 15 years.

445
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:03,163
And once you get out,
you'll be an ex-convict.

446
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,165
So what would you do then, huh?

447
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,209
Listen, I only want to help.

448
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,919
I'll help you not get caught.

449
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,506
Do you want that?

450
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:15,800
Or not?

451
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,679
And if you choose to be good,

452
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,015
I'll give you a deal.

453
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:26,186
You won't have to go to jail
or become an ex-con.

454
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,980
And didn't you say
you wanted to go to Australia? Huh?

455
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:33,818
If you keep the payments coming,
I'll let you visit, okay? Hmm?

456
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,447
Do you want that?

457
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:39,574
Beg, then.

458
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,287
Help me.

459
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,581
Say it nicely.

460
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:49,918
Please help me.

461
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,090
Good dog.

462
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,051
Hmm?

463
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:13,108
Come here!

464
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,089
Huh.

465
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,467
Shit, I must have misjudged you.

466
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,152
Come on, let's go.

467
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,696
All right. Good boy.

468
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,116
Let's go.

469
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,327
This isn't our house.

470
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:30,870
Come on.

471
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:02,735
What the…

472
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:14,789
So she hasn't been taking the milk inside,
so you looked over the fence.

473
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:19,252
And have you ever run into her
or ever seen her face before or anything?

474
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,130
-Huh?
-I'm asking if you knew her.

475
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,507
-Or if you've ever spoken with her before.
-Oh. No.

476
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,843
So you don't know her. Okay, I got it.

477
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,096
I might be getting in touch
with you later.

478
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,265
-Oh.
-Here, take my card.

479
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:34,475
I need you to text me
at this number today.

480
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,269
-Oh, okay.
-Okay. You can go now.

481
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,562
-Uh…
-Yes, you can go.

482
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,272
-Okay! Thank you.
-Thanks for your time.

483
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,235
Oh, hi.

484
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,112
-We finished inside.
-All right. Thank you.

485
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,363
-Have a good one.
-Thanks.

486
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,740
-Bye, thank you.
-Bye. Bye.

487
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,702
So. Did you remember to check his alibi?

488
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:57,707
Uh, well, he delivered her milk here, and…

489
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,626
-He looked over--
-Go after him, now.

490
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,210
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

491
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,755
Scuse me.
I just have a few more questions.

492
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,674
Man, what's with this neighborhood
these days?

493
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:10,553
In my 20 years here,
never seen anything like this.

494
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:13,181
Exactly. Just what the hell is all this?

495
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,391
Shit…

496
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,019
Hey, looks like revenge.

497
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,480
We'll have to see the autopsy results.

498
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,523
But just look at how damaged the body is.

499
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,359
-Hmm?
-Sit.

500
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,320
Is the dog also blind? Can't he tell
what's food and what isn't?

501
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,780
Gosh, would you look at that?

502
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,865
I guess
she wasn't completely blind.

503
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:32,617
Down. Down.

504
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,786
-Well, it might be for her family.
-Down!

505
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:35,995
She lives alone.

506
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,163
Hey!

507
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:38,873
Maybe she just listened to it.

508
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,416
Oh! This is 8K!

509
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,585
-Hey, what's that idiot doing?
-What?

510
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,128
It's really expensive!

511
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,964
-Stop it, all right?
-Ugh, that idiot.

512
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,967
-Come here.
-Put a leash on the dog! Moron!

513
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,637
Jeez! Why are you being so loud?
Quiet down. I'll go down.

514
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,681
Jeez, that clumsy idiot.
What do we do with him?

515
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:58,267
-Ugh! Why can't they control a single dog?
-Hey! Hey!

516
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:01,020
You can't do that to trained dogs.

517
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,438
Hey, let me handle it. Come on!

518
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,691
Yeah, come here, boy! Come here!

519
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,071
Don't let him escape.

520
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,573
DAEJEON DAESEOK CHURCH

521
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,410
SHARE YOUR LOVE WITH THOSE
WHO ARE VISUALLY IMPAIRED!

522
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:18,329
Get down! Let's get him!

523
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,501
-Get him.
-Huh? Hey, hey!

524
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,628
How many cops
do you need to catch a dog?

525
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,922
-He's trying to dig his way out.
-Stop it.

526
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,133
-Get him!
-What's with this dog?

527
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,760
-I told you…
-Grab the lead, tie him up.

528
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:36,389
-Here, hook this up to the leash.
-Okay, right.

529
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,433
-Stay.
-Here, put this on him.

530
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,727
Sit. Good boy. Sit down.

531
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,562
Ugh, seriously.

532
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,647
INSURANCE PAYMENT RECORDS

533
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:45,940
Hey.

534
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,442
What?

535
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,235
What is it?

536
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,446
Tell me.

537
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,494
Sir, you should come see this.

538
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,288
What the heck is this now?

539
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,249
Huh?

540
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,711
Did forensics leave?

541
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,631
They'd been missing for over
five years, so they were reported dead.

542
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,925
As for Seon Yeo-ok,

543
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:17,263
we couldn't find the cause of death
at the crime scene.

544
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,600
Ah. There were some items of note,

545
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:25,104
such as impact blood spatter, a moka
pot, a paper cup, and the milkman.

546
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:28,441
Now, we are approaching this
as an active crime investigation,

547
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,401
but we can't be sure quite yet.

548
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,278
Also, uh…

549
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:35,948
You can see here, um,
that the body has decomposed,

550
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,451
and the entire wound area
is far from intact.

551
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:43,247
So, uh, we're not sure what details
we'll get out of the autopsy.

552
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,749
Is that so?

553
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,001
And what about the bones?

554
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,755
-Hey. The skeletons.
-Yes?

555
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,006
-Th-the bones?
-Yes.

556
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,674
Well, um,

557
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:57,261
the two skeletons will
also get an autopsy tomorrow.

558
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,889
-We'll wait for the results.
-I see.

559
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,559
Let's skip
Team Four's briefing today.

560
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:06,395
All right. Hmm? Anything to add?

561
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,041
<i>I learned something new.</i>

562
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,380
<i>Humans can survive without any food</i>
<i>for four days.</i>

563
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,591
<i>On the second day of starvation,</i>

564
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,469
<i>you start crapping liquids</i>
<i>instead of solids.</i>

565
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,513
<i>And you don't feel hungry anymore.</i>

566
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,976
<i>Human life is resilient.</i>

567
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:48,771
<i>No.</i>

568
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,819
<i>Human life is easy to take.</i>

569
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:13,838
32 MISSED CALLS
BOSS (15), GYEONG-HWAN (13), MI-YEONG (3)

570
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:22,096
<i>It wasn't involuntary manslaughter,</i>
<i>accident, or self-defense.</i>

571
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:23,890
<i>It was murder.</i>

572
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:32,273
<i>So why is… no one coming to arrest me?</i>

573
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:38,905
Yes, we ran the paper cup, coffee beans,
and the fingerprints on the moka pot.

574
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:41,282
We gave them a run-through on AFIS,

575
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,118
but the ninhydrin reaction
showed nothing special.

576
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,164
-N-ninhydrin?
-Mm, ninhydrin.

577
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,374
-Sure, that. I know that. Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

578
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,253
And the coffee samples didn't show
anyone else's DNA either.

579
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,964
-Mm.
-Everything else was covered with saliva.

580
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,507
Huh?

581
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,259
Yes, saliva.

582
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,260
Dog drool.

583
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,723
The dog must have licked all the surfaces
that had fingerprints on them.

584
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,975
The door handles, the tables, the floor.

585
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,644
There was dog drool everywhere.

586
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:11,812
-Oh.
-Mm.

587
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:12,772
Yeah.

588
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,566
Did you find anything

589
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:20,363
in those samples of dog poop
that I had submitted to be tested?

590
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:21,614
The dog poop?

591
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,578
Judging by your face,
I'd say you're innocent.

592
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,581
Don't pick up
if Reporter Park calls.

593
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:31,791
Yes, sir.

594
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,000
What the heck is this?

595
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,920
-Why a dog in the station? It's bad luck!
-What's with the dog?

596
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:38,339
-To send a fecal sample to the NFS.
-Bring some salt!

597
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,674
Salt? Yes, sir. Okay.

598
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,176
Why didn't you just
send the dog there instead?

599
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,763
Come on, go easy on him.
He's only trying to help.

600
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,808
So? Did you find anything?

601
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,353
-You think I would be here if we did?
-Jesus.

602
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,188
Everything in there belonged to the girl.

603
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,649
-Look after that.
-All that time, we didn't find shit.

604
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,777
Are we sending the dog
to the district office?

605
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,445
-What about the family?
-Uh…

606
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:02,905
Don't even get me started.

607
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,157
I talked to her family this afternoon.

608
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,410
They asked why
we didn't have him killed already.

609
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:10,121
They said that he might attack people.

610
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,582
So they'll put him down?

611
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:16,919
What a waste.

612
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:00,212
Hey, I know you're home,
you crazy idiot!

613
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,506
I saw the meter go up on the ground floor!

614
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,134
Hello, ma'am. Hi.

615
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,887
Right, so, I haven't
been able to reach Tang.

616
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,640
He hasn't been coming to school,
and he's not taking any of my…

617
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,392
I got you, you son of a…

618
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,686
What's up with your face?
Is something wrong?

619
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,897
Hey. Shut up.

620
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,401
Uh, you little shit!
I came because I was worried.

621
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,904
Oof!

622
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,906
Do I look like a fucking pushover?

623
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,532
You son of a bitch.

624
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,244
For fuck's sake, come on.

625
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,038
God, you're an idiot.

626
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,291
Ah, you dumbass.

627
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,251
You're the dumbass.

628
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,755
You remember the tablet
you had in high school?

629
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:47,009
I'm the one who stole it,
but you didn't even know, you jerk.

630
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:52,973
You know what's funny?

631
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:55,976
I knew it was you.

632
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,439
We were both fucking losers.

633
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,235
I didn't want to fuck up my life. Huh?

634
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,529
So I pretended I didn't know.

635
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:09,615
And then you started
being nice to me. Huh?

636
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:11,409
Did you regret it?

637
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,286
It was really confusing.

638
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:17,665
I couldn't tell if you were
a good or bad guy.

639
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,420
You thought I wouldn't know, asshole?

640
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:27,049
Have fun rotting in the gutter forever.

641
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,218
You shithead.

642
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,930
And keep this.

643
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,475
You fucking asshole.

644
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,353
For fuck's sake. Jeez.

645
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,860
So things are going
to get messy, all right,

646
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,570
once news of this gets out.

647
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:52,241
Do not let yourselves become distracted
by anything that happens.

648
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,785
Just focus on the investigation.

649
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,454
-Understood?
-Yes, sir.

650
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,582
-Kang.
-Yes, sir.

651
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,168
So tell me, how is the evidence so slim?

652
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:05,796
-Proceed with caution…
-She brewed her coffee in a moka pot.

653
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,884
But then she poured it into a paper cup
when she already has regular cups.

654
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,760
-That's strange.
-This.

655
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,097
It's murder. I'm absolutely sure of it.

656
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:19,310
There was definitely
someone else with her that day.

657
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,854
Someone she drank her coffee with.

658
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:26,400
I think I could find something big
if I just dig more into this thing.

659
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:30,112
-Why don't you talk to the boss, then?
-Trust me. I'm sure about this…

660
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,238
'Cause there's no proof.

661
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,699
-You still talking to that shaman?
-Well…

662
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,498
All right, wake up.

663
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,376
Why don't you just
sleep right on the floor, huh?

664
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,422
Uh, what am I lookin' at?

665
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,633
Well, it should've been
decided earlier, but…

666
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,970
…there was a whole argument
about who was going to do it.

667
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,764
And, well, we lost.

668
00:41:56,847 --> 00:42:00,351
Take that document with you,
the dog too, and they'll take care of it.

669
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,229
You can just use the van.
It's open 24 hours.

670
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,897
Mm. So he's getting put down.

671
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,901
Hey, uh, I gotta take him?

672
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:11,070
You're the only one here right now.

673
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,157
Why'd we even bring him
here in the first place?

674
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,492
Catch!

675
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,833
You're open 24 hours, right?

676
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,003
Oh, uh, can I get there a bit later?

677
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,924
Uh, around 30 minutes, I guess?

678
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:34,176
Right. Okay, yeah, yeah.

679
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,720
Okay, thank you very much. Okay.

680
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:40,015
What's goin' on?
Why are you pullin' me so hard?

681
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:43,269
It's like you're not listening…
Hey, what are you doin'?

682
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:45,354
You can't just go in there!

683
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:46,814
What's in there?

684
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,191
You're making a racket. Come here.

685
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,526
Come on.

686
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:07,835
NINE UNREAD MESSAGES

687
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,504
HELLO, MR. LEE TANG
THIS IS DETECTIVE LEE CHANG-TAEK

688
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,632
MR. JUNG GANG-HYO FROM OS25
FILED A COMPLAINT AGAINST YOU

689
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,092
PLEASE REPLY

690
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:25,936
-Why talk about girls again?
-Ugh, for fuck's sake.

691
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,397
You always talk about girls
when you're drunk.

692
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,607
Hey, hold on.

693
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:32,484
Isn't that fucker the cop from last time?

694
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:33,986
-Right?
-Huh?

695
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,530
Man, I'll fucking gut that little bitch.

696
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,948
-That bitch-ass cop.
-Hey.

697
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:41,285
-I'll do it. I swear, man.
-Mess with a cop and you'll get gutted.

698
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:44,580
The fuck you talking about, dumbass?
We could take him.

699
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:45,914
-I'll do it.
-You stupid fucker.

700
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:48,792
You don't think I remember
you pissing yourself in front of a cop?

701
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,711
-I'll fuck him up.
-You'll fuck him up?

702
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,296
Do it.

703
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:53,589
-Hey, hey, hey!
-Shit.

704
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:56,800
I fucking knew you couldn't do it.
Hey, hey, hey!

705
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,511
Hey, hey, hey. Let's just go, man.

706
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:02,139
Remember the asshole
who stuck a piece of gum in your hair?

707
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,016
-With the beard?
-They're fucking pigs.

708
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:06,727
You're a useless asshole.
Let's go fuck that guy up.

709
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:08,562
Come on. Let's just go.

710
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,859
What are you wagging your tail for
when you're gonna die?

711
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:17,237
-Keep going'.
-Yo.

712
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,281
-Hey, wait.
-Fuck you!

713
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:21,784
You motherfucker!

714
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,786
You shit. You fucking pig.

715
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:25,704
What the fuck?

716
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,458
That fucking idiot. We're fucked!

717
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:03,200
DECEASED, BLIND WOMAN IN DAEJEON
FOUND TO HAVE MURDERED HER OWN PARENTS

718
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:09,081
<i>I learned one more thing.</i>

719
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,502
<i>I realized the people I killed</i>

720
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,129
<i>had deserved to die.</i>

721
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:18,215
Fuck me.

722
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,426
<i>I murdered two people,</i>

723
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,053
<i>but there's no evidence.</i>

724
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,643
<i>I guess I won the lottery.</i>

725
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:38,026
-Fuck, aren't we in trouble for real?
-Why?

726
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,112
I might be an accomplice in this.

727
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:42,906
-Hell yeah. Buy one, get one, bro.
-Ah, shit, man.

728
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:46,535
Your parents will pay and settle this,
right? Won't they?

729
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:47,995
-Right?
-I don't know. I don't know.

730
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:48,996
-Jae-jun?
-Stop it.

731
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,831
-Uh, they will, though, right?
-Cut it out.

732
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:54,001
-Okay. They'll take care of it, though?
-I don't fucking know!

733
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:57,087
-They have to.
-Mom'll kill me if I get in trouble.

734
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,297
Let's go to yours.

735
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,049
-I already told you my mom's there.
-Oh?

736
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,093
Let's just go to the sauna, you idiot.

737
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,554
Stop giving me shit, asshole.

738
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,515
I'm sorry, all right?
I'm fucking sorry for everything.

739
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,642
-Let's just go to the sauna.
-Cigarette.

740
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,187
Huh?

741
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,646
-Fuck. Fucking hell.
-Come on.

742
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,148
I must have dropped them.

743
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:19,151
-Cut the bullshit, dumbass.
-I'm serious, you idiot.

744
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:21,236
Don't have 'em.

745
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:26,074
-Fuck's sake. It wasn't easy to get them.
-We should've taken his fucking wallet.

746
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:28,619
He ain't shit.
He's soaked in blood right now.

747
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:31,705
-Hold on, come here. Jae-jun.
-Huh?

748
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:33,999
On your left down the street.

749
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,335
That skinny bastard there…
Wait, come back.

750
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:38,796
-What about him?
-Should we rob him?

751
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:41,089
-Ah! At it again, huh?
-Let's do it.

752
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:42,883
-Want me to show you?
-Let me.

753
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,343
-I'll do it.
-Move.

754
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:46,094
-You got him?
-Don't be like that.

755
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,971
-Fine.
-I know you've never done this.

756
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:50,140
Fine, then show me. Hey, dude!

757
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:53,018
Bro! Hello?

758
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:54,645
Yo!

759
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:58,148
The hell, man? We're talkin' to you. Hey.

760
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:02,402
Jeez, you fuckin' reek of booze, bro.

761
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:29,137
Come here!

762
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:06,717
Hmm.

763
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:22,691
Huh?
