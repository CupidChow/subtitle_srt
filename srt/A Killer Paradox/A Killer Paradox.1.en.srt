00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:12,887
A KILLER PARADOX

2
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,098
<i>Stop right there. All right.</i>

3
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,558
<i>-Now move this here.</i>
-<i>Okay.</i>

4
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:19,060
-<i>We got a picture! Nice!</i>
-<i>We got a picture.</i>

5
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:21,104
-<i>Hey!</i>
-<i>Oh, no.</i>

6
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,814
-<i>Take this.</i>
-<i>Look at that!</i>

7
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:25,650
-<i>Stretch out this part.</i>
-<i>Try to hold your palm flat.</i>

8
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,987
-<i>No. Hold your palm flat.</i>
-<i>In you go!</i>

9
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,364
-<i>Turn this.</i>
-<i>Okay!</i>

10
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,033
You having a good time there?

11
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:36,911
-Perks of getting discharged.
-What are you talking about?

12
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,872
I've been out six months already.

13
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,999
Wow, really?

14
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,210
Time flies when you're not doing anything.

15
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:48,631
Yeong. Don't you have some work for Tang
while he's here?

16
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,009
-Work? What?
-Oh, you know.

17
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,594
Ah!

18
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,554
SON SEONG-UK AND LEE YEONG

19
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,306
I almost
didn't recognize the groom.

20
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,641
He's your brother-in-law now.

21
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,810
-Oh, right.
-Were you up all night gaming?

22
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,480
I've been grinding.
You know I've been working.

23
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:06,107
-My part-time job ends late.
-As if.

24
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,860
Kid. I don't care if you're working
or playing games.

25
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,404
-Go to bed when it's time to sleep.
-Yeah, yeah.

26
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,697
How's the picture?

27
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,283
Eh. It doesn't do you justice, honey.

28
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,243
-Nah.
-I've only heard that from you.

29
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,995
Oh, who was it? Jae-deok's son.

30
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,040
-I heard he was tutoring or something.
-Oh, come on, Dad.

31
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:25,877
-It's a few hours for decent money.
-University-wise, he's on another level.

32
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,754
Think about it
from the parents' point of view.

33
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:30,048
Would you want
your oldest son to be a tutor?

34
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,883
Hah! That is true.

35
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,844
-Why are you doing home?
-Oh!

36
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,181
That working holiday thing
I told you about…

37
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,642
-I wanna do one of those.
-Working holiday?

38
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,852
-Yeah.
-So you can pick fruit in Australia?

39
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,646
Australia? Why Australia?

40
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,190
-Is the fruit good there?
-Not Australia. Canada.

41
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:51,111
If you feel like picking fruit,
go over to your aunt's in Nonsan.

42
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,070
Dad, fold some.

43
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,823
-Oh, fine.
-Why go so far away just to do labor?

44
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,658
-You don't have experience.
-I wanna try it.

45
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,535
You sure you can? You should check.

46
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,495
I wouldn't go right away.

47
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,872
I'd need to get the visa
and prep for a while.

48
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,209
Have to get a doctor's appointment
and all the paperwork. Everything I need.

49
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,961
Wait. If you go to Australia…

50
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:10,713
-So he can't use his savings account?
-Not Australia. Canada.

51
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,133
-Do you have the money?
-Yeah, he still can.

52
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,551
-I have savings?
-Can he?

53
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,136
Hey, fold while you talk.

54
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,433
Hey, loser.You give up already?

55
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,561
Give up what, dumbass?

56
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,355
Finding a job and a life, you broke ass.

57
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:32,068
Oh, a job? Not really.
I haven't even really looked for one.

58
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:36,030
And the trip? You still trying to escape?

59
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:38,867
Hey.

60
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,036
You… remember what high school was like?

61
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,415
-Are you serious?
-Mm.

62
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,419
Uh…

63
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,379
I don't know.

64
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,883
I remember the spaghetti was all right,
and…

65
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:58,219
-And the school nurse was--
-You two never talk about high school.

66
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,597
Were you guys actually close?

67
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,308
We were trying to be considerate.

68
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:06,019
We just didn't want you to feel left out,
all right?

69
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,437
Oh, really?

70
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,481
Why, what about it?

71
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,233
Well,

72
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:16,112
things have been smoother since then.

73
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,158
I wanna live a different life
or something, I guess.

74
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:24,662
Why isn't there anything
spec-- spectacular in our lives, man?

75
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,416
Well, your life is pretty
spe-- spe-- spectacular, isn't it?

76
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,418
Yeah?

77
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,755
Hey. I've thought about this, okay?

78
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,090
You're just gonna waste money again.

79
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:40,053
Remember that gym membership
you had? You went only once, right?

80
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,763
That was so freakin' stupid.

81
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:45,433
Then, you spent 200,000 won
on that whole workout thing.

82
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,977
Ah, shit, man. Pull-up bar.

83
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,520
God, you're such an ass.

84
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:52,357
And before that, what was it?

85
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,194
You went and got all into board games
and spent all your time at the club. Like…

86
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,446
Not like you didn't do
the same thing, asshole.

87
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,198
<i>Oppa. </i>Check it out.

88
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,493
"The night before last,
I had the hottest hook-up."

89
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,119
Not that one, this one.

90
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,082
"I'm a guy
who already did my military service."

91
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,167
"I'm going back to school
after my working holiday."

92
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,128
"All my friends have jobs now.
I don't know what I'm going to do."

93
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,381
-"I'm so worried, so I'm writing this."
-Shit, man.

94
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,424
-That's you!
-Go to hell.

95
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,468
This is Tang in three years.

96
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,434
<i>This is Canada!</i>

97
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,395
<i>It's the Rocky Mountains, everyone.</i>

98
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,355
<i>Wow.</i>

99
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,691
<i>Wow, it's really insane.</i>

100
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,694
<i>You just have to come see this.</i>

101
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,571
<i>Guys, it's totally awesome!</i>

102
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,532
<i>Look at this amazing view!</i>

103
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,075
<i>Making my way here was--</i>

104
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,745
Aah, shit.

105
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,124
Give it a rest.

106
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,543
<i>…so hard.</i>

107
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:55,545
<i>Guys.</i>

108
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,422
<i>If heaven existed,</i>

109
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,882
<i>this place would be it.</i>

STARTING APRIL 1
BEEF UP YOUR AVERAGE BODY!

111
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,560
Shit.

112
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,035
Hmm?

113
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,125
YOUR ORDER HAS ARRIVED
ROCKY MOUNTAINS PICTURE FRAME NO.7

114
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,143
Shit.

115
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,443
Ah, shit.

116
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,866
I want a refund.

117
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,534
What?

118
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,245
I said I want a refund.
I think it went bad.

119
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,793
Well, it's not expired.

120
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,712
If it isn't expired, then
you must have stored it wrong.

121
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,923
It's the <i>sanjeok. </i>It tastes sour.

122
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,008
Try it yourself if you don't believe me.

123
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,346
That's… how it always tastes, so…

124
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,265
Are you for real?

125
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,935
What's your name? Jung Eun-seon?

126
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,395
Hey!

127
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,522
So? Am I the bad guy?

128
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,815
Huh? Is that it?

129
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,024
Hey, don't ignore me.

130
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,610
-Wake up. Get your shit together.
-Here's your refund.

131
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:45,863
You clean it up.

132
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,622
Shouldn't you be here
before your shift starts?

133
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:17,854
Huh.

134
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,525
<i>Now I'm swimming!</i>

135
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:26,362
<i>-Oh, man! Let's try again.</i>
-I'll get us another drink.

136
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,822
No, buddy, that's okay.

137
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,699
<i>-This is the hotel…</i>
-Seriously, let me.

138
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,410
-Come on, man, it's my treat. No. Hey!
-Zip it, you. Enough!

139
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,954
-I'm buying, ya bastard. You go sit.
-Yeah--

140
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,497
-Go sit down.
-Hello.

141
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,208
-All right, all right.
-Give me Esse.

142
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:46,424
Hey, hey, no. I want the, uh, "Soon,"
with the bamboo on it.

143
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,342
Oh, you mean Soo?

144
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:49,927
These?

145
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:53,431
Nah, not this one. The 0.5 milligram one.

146
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,691
SMOKING CAN CAUSE ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION!

147
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,235
Oh, fucking bitch. Not this…

148
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,572
Get me one with another logo.

149
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,508
There. One more.

150
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,761
-Two packs cost 9,000.
-Hmm?

151
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,304
9,000, please.

152
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:36,224
Ah, shit, my… oh, money…

153
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:45,441
I heard this is how kids these days
make a heart. Is that right?

154
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,860
Not funny?

155
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,322
God, you little shit… Here.

156
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,535
Bring me a bottle of Cass
and dried squid legs outside, got it?

157
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,702
-What?
-That's right.

158
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,663
Sir, wait. You have to get it…

159
00:08:58,746 --> 00:08:59,622
Hey!

160
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,458
Hey, let's have another round!

161
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,043
Hey, why are your hands empty?

162
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,337
-Just wait, you little bitch.
-<i>Have a good day!</i>

163
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,174
-Hey, sir. I can't--
-Hey, do you have the squids I asked for?

164
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,717
Not the dried ones.

165
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,678
Listen. I can't bring them to you.

166
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,429
-First, you have to pay.
-You fucker.

167
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,516
-You think we're not gonna pay--
-Shit, man, stop. Knock it off!

168
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,725
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah…

169
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,436
-He's working. Why say that? Fucking hell.
-He's being a fucking ass.

170
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,397
-"Fucking ass"? I'm sorry.
<i>-Have a good day!</i>

171
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,776
He's not like that usually. I don't know
what his problem is. Oh, I'm sorry.

172
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:34,949
Really, I mean it. He's normally
such a nice, courteous, and quiet guy.

173
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,493
I don't know what's gotten into him.

174
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,870
Yeah, he's not himself today.

175
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:44,625
Thing is, he got an earful all day
from the site manager, that's why.

176
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,419
-Ah, yeah…
-You got a plastic bag?

177
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,463
-Yeah.
-Oh, wait a minute, yeah.

178
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,341
Oh, gosh.

179
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:57,305
You remind me of my kid back at the house,
having a tough time working and all.

180
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,973
-Yeah.
-We'll be out of here soon.

181
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,308
-Okay.
-How much is it?

182
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:03,311
-15,150 won.
-Ten thousand…

183
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,688
-And did you want a receipt?
-No. Thank you.

184
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,691
-All right.
-Okay. 15,150 won.

185
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:09,817
-Yeah.
<i>-Have a good day!</i>

186
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,944
-Here's the 50.
-Hey! Get two more bottles.

187
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,613
-Gosh.
-Sir, you can't smoke in here.

188
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,114
-Oh, Lord.
-I can smoke, fuck it--

189
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,074
-What makes you think you can smoke?
-Hey.

190
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,159
Go on and get out.

191
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,620
-Hey, did you pay?
-Oh, come on.

192
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,913
-Let's go.
-Ugh, are you kidding me?

193
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,461
-Hey, come on…
-Calm down. It's fine.

194
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:34,967
BUTTER ROASTED

195
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,469
Seriously?

196
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,180
Spectacular, isn't it?

197
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,360
<i>Have a good day!</i>

198
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,321
Hey, Tang. Good work.

199
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,031
-Go home now.
-Okay.

200
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,450
Oh, sir.

201
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,744
Could I borrow this hammer?

202
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,146
Shit.

203
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:44,870
Sir.

204
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,916
Sir, you can't sleep there.

205
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,043
Great.

206
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,182
Uh, sir?

207
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,438
Sir, wait.

208
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,815
Hey, sir.

209
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,192
Huh?

210
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:19,155
Your, uh, buddy,
he's sleeping right over there.

211
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,323
Oh?

212
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,534
It's okay. Yeah.

213
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,786
-Go. Go on.
-Huh?

214
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,290
Uh, it's gonna start raining
pretty soon, so…

215
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,253
Get outta here.

216
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,505
Get lost.

217
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,572
No, uh… I…

218
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:12,500
You motherfucker.
Why, huh? You dumb son of a bitch!

219
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,584
Why, huh?

220
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,128
Why won't you go? You fucker!

221
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,755
-I told you to go!
-Ah!

222
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,429
-Gyeong-hwan. You motherfucker. Twerp.
-Son of a bitch.

223
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,057
-You must have been hungry to cut in line?
-You pathetic dipshit.

224
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,684
-Aren't you gonna help him?
-We were in front of you.

225
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,603
-Are you gonna help?
-You're done for.

226
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,647
-You son of a bitch.
-You gonna help?

227
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,357
I bet he's full now.

228
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,858
You fucking bastard.

229
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,319
-Chin up, Gyeong-hwan.
-Hey, you're hurting him.

230
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,906
Let's give him one good hit and end it.

231
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,324
Just one. Hey, Tang.

232
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:48,911
-I could use some more. Bastard.
-You pick. Number one, here…

233
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,121
Two, right here…

234
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,999
-Number three.
-Where could it be?

235
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,751
-Oh, here. The balls.
-I'm good with that.

236
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,461
-Pick one.
-Yeah.

237
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,673
-Balls, good thinking.
-Choose already. Come on.

238
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,883
-Hey, pick already!
-Gyeong-hwan.

239
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,052
-You don't mind just having one ball?
-Can't decide?

240
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:08,389
-Hey! Gyeong-hwan. Look at this bitch.
-Should I flick it? Kick it?

241
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,850
-Fucking hell. You suck so much.
-Come on, man.

242
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,852
The fuck, idiots? Are you both mute?

243
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,645
-God, this is boring already.
-Bastards.

244
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,814
-I feel so fucking bad for Gyeong-hwan.
-Fucker!

245
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,148
-Hey!
-Boring.

246
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,109
-This is no fun.
-Why won't you answer, bitch?

247
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,590
<i>Striking back</i>

248
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,175

249
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,848

00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,294
Come on! Let's get another drink!

267
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,420
Hold on!

268
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:29,089
-Hey…
-It's pouring. Where would we go?

269
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,883
This awesome pork skin place.

270
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,385
Huh? Whatever, you can go alone.
I'm going home!

271
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,513
Hey, come with me.
Come on, let's drink some more.

272
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,974
Hey! Where are you going?

273
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,478
Huh?

274
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,980
Rex.

275
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:47,775
What is it?

276
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,110
We gotta go.

277
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:51,695
Yeah.

278
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,447
Let's go.

279
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,411
Why is there music coming from the ground?

280
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,456
This song is so old.

281
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,094
Hmm. Rex.

282
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,430
Hey, come back.
You're going the wrong way.

283
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,556
SEEING-EYE DOG

284
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,516
Rex!

285
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,935
Come on, what are you doing?

286
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,270
Rex.

287
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,815
Oh, what are you doing, huh? Let's go!

288
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,612
Okay, buddy. All right, let's go. Come on.

289
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,575
Do you feel wronged?

290
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,118
Do you?

291
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:25,956
Jeez.

292
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,084
Hey, part-timer.

293
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,963
You do a terrible thing
like this to someone,

294
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,966
and you're only worried about yourself.

295
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,094
How do you sleep at night?

296
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:41,972
Look…

297
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,433
I have

298
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:46,977
an old mother.

299
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,062
She has dementia.

300
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:51,732
You know what else?

301
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,859
I have three kids.

302
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,361
You see, my kids…

303
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,114
They're what get me
through the day.

304
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,783
What are you gonna do?

305
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,327
Huh?

306
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,788
'Cause this is all your fault, you know?

307
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:08,707
Hey, buddy…

308
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:13,128
What did I say? Huh?

309
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:18,091
I only just wanted you to leave me alone.

310
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,176
You fucker!

311
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,176
Open the door.

312
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,637
It's Gyeong-hwan.

313
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,433
Dude, open the door. Please.

314
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:10,894
Hey, thank you. Thanks.

315
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,355
Why didn't you answer my calls, jerk?

316
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,023
Oh, I'm dying.

317
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,859
Hey, could you get me
a cup of water, please?

318
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,071
I got shitfaced
with the guys that I play with.

319
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,032
I, of course,
outdrank all of them, though.

320
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,621
Oh, I told Mi-yeong
I was drinking with you,

321
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,915
and so you gotta back me up, okay?

322
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:36,545
DOES YOUR SENTENCE GET REDUCED
IF YOU KILLED SOMEONE BY ACCIDENT?

323
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,149
No way. I didn't…

324
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,192
You've got the wrong guy!

325
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,111
-He's in there!
-Back off! Back off!

326
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:05,532
I'm telling you, I'm innocent!
You can't do this! Let me go!

327
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,369
Hey, are you asleep?

328
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,167
Gi-hun and his gang.

329
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,796
What do you imagine they're doin' now?

330
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,594
Ah, fuck.

331
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:30,891
They must still be a bunch of shithead,
lowlife idiots making trouble, right?

332
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,187
Fuck me.

333
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,646
No.

334
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,815
They're doin' fuckin' well.

335
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,570
I looked them up on Instagram.

336
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,909
That asshole Gi-hun has his own business.

337
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,954
He's always bragging
about his Mercedes online.

338
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,707
One's a seventh-grade teacher.

339
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,377
One just got married.

340
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,214
They're all doin' fuckin' great.

341
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,673
Livin' large.

342
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,594
What are you doing?

343
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,137
Huh?

344
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,015
I said, what are you looking for?

345
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:13,975
Oh.

346
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,435
My promise ring.

347
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,521
Promise ring?

348
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:19,940
What's it look like?

349
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,901
<i>It was the same when I cheated</i>
<i>with a girl from the board game club</i>

350
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,111
<i>before my service.</i>

351
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,070
Huh…

352
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,906
<i>I was gonna break up</i>
<i>with my girlfriend if I got caught.</i>

353
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:29,741
Keep lookin'.

354
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:34,037
<i>But luckily, that never happened.</i>

355
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,250
There.

356
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,882
<i>What are you doing?</i>

357
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,594
Oh, shoot. My tablet.

358
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,431
-Oh, that?
-Yeah.

359
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:56,393
-Hey, let's all go with Ji-eun.
-You asshole…

360
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:57,561
Shit…

361
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,229
-What?
-Motherfuckers.

362
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:02,190
What? Why not, man?

363
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:06,403
<i>And when I stole something</i>
<i>back in high school,</i>

364
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,780
<i>I got lucky and got away with it too.</i>

365
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,575
Hey, you had it with you
at lunch, didn't you?

366
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,832
<i>No one suspected me.</i>

367
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,502
<i>It felt like</i>

368
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,921
<i>everything was going my way.</i>

369
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,558
Hey.

370
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,395
What…

371
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,230
What time did you get here earlier?

372
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,484
Eleven.

373
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:48,945
No, idiot.

374
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,824
You got here when I got home from work.
That's ten.

375
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,911
Oh, yeah, ten.
Right.

376
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:01,333
No.

377
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:06,046
I watched the soccer game
till the end, so it was 11. You dumbass.

378
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,806
When you go on your trip,

379
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,476
can you give me the pull-up bar?

380
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:21,853
Oh, shit.

381
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,483
Just go to sleep, you freeloading idiot.

382
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,653
Stop talking to me so I can.

383
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:32,280
I have a morning class tomorrow.

384
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,351
Ah, shit.

385
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,742
-Yong-jae.
-Yes, sir!

386
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,080
Did you find anything there?

387
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:25,292
Uh, there's a security camera
in that alley over by the market,

388
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,334
but nothing here.

389
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,337
This place has been empty
'cause of the redevelopment project.

390
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,590
-Nothin's here.
-Hey, over there. That house.

391
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,843
-Does anyone live there?
-The one up there? I'll check.

392
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,137
-Ask the patrol unit.
-Hurry up. Go on.

393
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,097
-I'll go check.
-Ah, Christ.

394
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,391
Hey, hey, hey.
Tell him to put his gloves on.

395
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,684
You too, come on.

396
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:46,354
I'm not doing anything.
Put your gloves on, Detective Jang.

397
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,440
Come on.

398
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,859
God, you never listen.

399
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,532
Hey, why aren't you turning that off?

400
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,075
Where is it?

401
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,621
What's wrong with this?

402
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,790
Fuck, I'm late!

403
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,336
Oh, my head's pounding.

404
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:12,964
Oh shit. I'm late,
I'm late, I'm late, I'm late.

405
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:14,549
I'm outta here.

406
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,301
Shit, I'm so late.

407
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,053
Oh crap!

408
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:21,556
<i>My day shift girl says she's sick</i>
<i>and can't make it.</i>

409
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,600
<i>But honestly, I bet she isn't really.</i>

410
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,518
<i>Probably has a date with her boyfriend.</i>

411
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:26,436
BOSS

412
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,730
<i>But what can you do? She says she's sick.</i>

413
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,608
<i>You can fill in for her, right?</i>

414
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,528
<i>Get here as soon as you can, okay?</i>

415
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,614
<i>I'll fill in until then.</i>

416
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,659
<i>Ugh, I stayed up all night. I'm so tired.</i>

417
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,516
-Yes.
<i>-Have a good day!</i>

418
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,560
Two people, dead on the ground,
right near the market,

419
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,020
It's unbelievable!

420
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,021
Hello.

421
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:13,483
They need to clean up these streets.
What kind of country is this?

422
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,276
The police just sit on their asses.

423
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,779
I've never seen a patrol car
in this neighborhood.

424
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,532
Need cigarettes?

425
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,283
How many, uh…

426
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,327
security cameras does this place have?

427
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:25,870
What?

428
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,923
-Her face is fucking…
-What about her?

429
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,217
She keeps giving me
a bunch of shit.

430
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,136
I fucking hate her, seriously, bro.

431
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:44,806
-Wait, who are you talking about?
-You know.

432
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,225
That bitch that smells
like fabric softener.

433
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,561
I don't know what the teachers look like.

434
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,771
Dumbass.
Come to school for once in your life.

435
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,732
Let me get a light.

436
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,862
Hey, sir. Excuse me,
but could I borrow, um, your lighter?

437
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,949
I don't smoke, punk.

438
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:05,118
Ah. Thanks anyway.

439
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,456
Man…

440
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,790
What? What's up?

441
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,043
-Hey, so… I'm a punk?
-Hey, hey, hey.

442
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,545
-Let's go. I've got a vape.
-Get off.

443
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:16,921
-Let's smoke this.
-Let go of me.

444
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,423
-You look familiar.
-Come on.

445
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,175
-Come on, Jae-jun.
-Oh yeah? That so?

446
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,802
-Let's go, you idiot.
-Wanna go to the station now?

447
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:25,930
-Mm-hmm. You get all the hard drives?
-Yes, sir. I got everything.

448
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,141
-Let's go!
-Oh, and put these boys in the car.

449
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:29,934
-Wait.
-They need a lesson.

450
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:33,146
-What?
-Wait, we aren't high school students.

451
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,064
-We're not.
-Get in the black car now.

452
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,733
-We're not in high school.
-Uh-huh…

453
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,067
-Right,
-Really, sir…

454
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:40,111
-Yeah, sure, sure.
-We aren't… Sir, listen.

455
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,071
-We're 20, sir.
-Seriously, bro…

456
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,907
You idiots. God.

457
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,909
What is it this time?

458
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:48,620
-I swear, this time we didn't do it.
-As if.

459
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,247
-Look at this haircut.
-Don't touch my hair.

460
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,458
-What did they do wrong?
-But we weren't…

461
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,919
They're just petty offenders.

462
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,630
Look at you idiots.

463
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:02,425
Hey, he's just raggin' on you 'cause
you guys are slouchin' in your chairs.

464
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:07,096
See, there's not a lot
I can do about you boys.

465
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,391
I'm givin' you a warning.

466
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:16,523
But… kids need consequences
to put some sense into your heads.

467
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,608
Whether it's a fine or some jail time.

468
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:24,322
-Right, Detective Jang?
-If I catch you guys at it one more time…

469
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,281
Hmm?

470
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,449
You heard him.

471
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,494
-Sit up straight.
-Did you get anything from the cameras?

472
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,579
-Not really.
-Want me to call your parents?

473
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,582
I'm checking out some people
the shop owners might've run into.

474
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,877
How could they both end up
dying after a fight, though?

475
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,380
The bodies are in
completely different areas.

476
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:41,464
Yes, that's true.

477
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:46,010
Hey, but when your brain hemorrhages,
you don't go down right on the spot.

478
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,430
It's possible you kill the other guy,
then collapse and die on the way.

479
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,765
That's true too.

480
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,518
You just have to go
off of the test results we get.

481
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:56,104
You can't rely
on your gut feeling with this.

482
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:59,065
-Just believe what you see, all right?
-Well, I'm lookin'.

483
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,443
Fine. He won't listen.

484
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,195
Do you wanna turn out like him?

485
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,947
Why are your pants all ripped up?

486
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,908
You'll freeze to death
trying to look cool, dummy.

487
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,708
The guy who worked here yesterday.

488
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:18,501
Yesterday?

489
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:20,003
Yeah.

490
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:23,548
The one who came in at 4:00 p.m.
and left at 10:00 in the evening.

491
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:27,135
Oh! You must be talking about Tang.
Lee Tang.

492
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,138
His name is Lee Tang?

493
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,640
Lee Tang. Yes. The name's odd.

494
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:36,060
-Can you give me his contact information?
-Right, his number.

495
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,103
Uh… Oh.

496
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,938
Ah! There he is.

497
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,442
-Hey, just in time, Tang. Come on in.
<i>-Have a good day!</i>

498
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,068
You heard what happened yesterday?

499
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,612
-Huh?
-There was a murder.

500
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,196
There's a detective here now.

501
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,033
So, uh, go talk to him.
Tell him everything you know.

502
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,326
<i>Have a good day!</i>

503
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,162
Have a seat.

504
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,669
Oh.

505
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,550
I haven't been sleepin' well lately.

506
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:13,598
So, if you're a college student,
I guess you're at Usang?

507
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:16,768
-Yeah.
-Mm.

508
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,564
So…

509
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,402
Are we gonna talk right here?

510
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,740
You want to go to the station?

511
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,159
Oh. No.

512
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,498
You recall those older guys, yeah?

513
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,750
This guy? Hmm?

514
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,589
They threw money

515
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,385
and made you bring food out.

516
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,470
And left a mess.

517
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,555
They were pretty drunk.

518
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:57,809
That why you killed them?

519
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,519
Huh?

520
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:08,736
I'm screwin' around.
You really seem nervous.

521
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:18,955
Those two drank here at this table
for somethin' like two hours yesterday.

522
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,125
I need to know what they talked about.

523
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,878
It was late at night, so I'm guessing
you could hear 'em from inside.

524
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:27,922
So, do you remember anything?

525
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:30,925
Just…

526
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,679
a bit about their family.

527
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,223
Family?

528
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,851
How things have been hard.

529
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:44,605
-I told you my mother has dementia, okay?
-<i>That his mother has dementia.</i>

530
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,065
Besides, I've got three children!

531
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,859
<i>And that he has three kids.</i>

532
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,528
And then what?

533
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,488
AN YONG-JAE

534
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:38,701
I… I'm not really…

535
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,078
Detective Jang.

536
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,163
They identified the prints. It's a match.

537
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,791
It's like Detective Park said.

538
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:47,418
<i>They killed each other.</i>
<i>We found a witness too.</i>

539
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,253
<i>His statement even matches.</i>

540
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,589
<i>Apparently, the two got drunk</i>
<i>and got into an argument.</i>

541
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:54,008
<i>Lee Gwang-hun must've hit him</i>
<i>with a brick first.</i>

542
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,844
<i>We found blood from Lee Gwang-hun's head.</i>

543
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,138
<i>It was on Kim Myeong-jin's speaker.</i>

544
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:02,225
It looks like…
they did actually kill each other.

545
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,393
Mm. Mm.

546
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,907
Could I borrow this hammer?

547
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,883
-Yong-jae.
-Sir?

548
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:39,387
Well done.

549
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,559
You found the witness too. That's good.

550
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,769
I appreciate it.

551
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,565
You did good, but be careful.

552
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:52,775
About what?

553
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,111
You talked about the case
in front of the kid.

554
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,322
Don't get sloppy.

555
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:05,204
That was neglectful.

556
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,165
Sorry if I made you Jang-gry.

557
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,295
Oh. No, I was joking.

558
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:22,013
They choose to fight somewhere
there aren't any security cameras.

559
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,306
What are the odds?

560
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,266
I mean, it's unbelievable.

561
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,478
So he got hit there, then walked all
the way over here before he dropped dead?

562
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,647
-How's that even possible?
-Whatever.

563
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,691
Hey, hand me the wire stripper.

564
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:34,609
Okay.

565
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,194
Here.

566
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,696
<i>The man's eyes were swollen too.</i>

567
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:42,408
<i>Which means he would have manifested</i>
<i>these symptoms after the first blow.</i>

568
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:48,039
<i>However, the autopsy shows</i>
<i>a blood alcohol level of 0.13,</i>

569
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:50,666
<i>so there's a chance</i>
<i>he might not have felt them at all.</i>

570
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,047
How long have you known
Mr. Kim Myeong-jin?

571
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:03,179
I think I've known him
for around maybe three years or so.

572
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:06,224
I'm home! I brought over a friend.

573
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,309
-You don't mind, right?
-The kids are sleeping! Sh!

574
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:11,145
-Sh! All right. Get us a drink and food.
-Oh, ma'am, excuse me.

575
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,689
-<i>One day, my husband…</i>
-He said we could come here.

576
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,399
<i>-He brought him home.</i>
-What'd I tell ya?

577
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,318
<i>Said he was a friend who worked with him.</i>

578
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,527
…real big heart.

579
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:19,862
I'm heading out.

580
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:22,448
-Hey! Hey, Yong-jun.
-All right, see you.

581
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,909
<i>-He was a caring man.</i>
-Wait. Hang on.

582
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,911
<i>-Always very nice.</i>
-I have something for you.

583
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:30,331
-I know it's not much, but take it.
-Ah, you don't need to do that.

584
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,499
-Oh, Myeong-jin!
-Bye, kiddo.

585
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:34,001
Keep doing that,
and you're gonna spoil the kid.

586
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,711
-Oh, come on.
-See ya.

587
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,130
All right. Bye.

588
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,299
<i>-He became friends with the kids too.</i>
-Come on.

589
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,093
<i>And would give them pocket money.</i>

590
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:46,514
<i>He'd even remember my birthday,</i>
<i>and my husband never did.</i>

591
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:51,102
Wow, your cooking is just as good
as a professional chef!

592
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,397
Mm! God, your skills are wasted
as a housewife.

593
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,482
Man!

594
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,320
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

595
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,572
Would you like
to come have a drink?

596
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,143
So…

597
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:35,896
You were going to get a divorce,
as soon as your son moved out,

598
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,941
and marry your husband's friend
after that.

599
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,402
Does that sound right?

600
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,323
Yes.

601
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,657
<i>Potato, potah-to.</i>

602
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,953
What's the point of marriage
if you just let yourself be seduced, huh?

603
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,874
And she's serving food at her lover's
funeral when her husband also died?

604
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,000
She's nuts!

605
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:56,917
Hey.

606
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,170
See, look.

607
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,758
That's no way to behave
when you've got a son that age.

608
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,343
Even I'd knife the guy.

609
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:08,137
-Not a knife. A brick.
-Oh yeah? So?

610
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,931
We didn't find any blood on the brick.
What's that about?

611
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,476
-Don't start with that.
-And about Kim Myeong-jin.

612
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:17,480
-There's somethin' strange about him.
-What are you sayin'?

613
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,774
I looked up his records,
but nothing came up.

614
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,902
And, most importantly, I think, well…

615
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:24,445
I think I've seen the guy.

616
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:27,948
Doesn't work if you <i>think </i>you've seen him.
Just believe what you see.

617
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,912
Enjoy your break.
I gotta go somewhere.

618
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:33,996
I'll come with you.

619
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,344
Can you recommend a gum?

620
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,262
OH YEAH!
BUBBLE GUM

621
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,806
Is this bubble gum?

622
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,017
Yeah. I saw you blowing a bubble before.

623
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:00,898
I can do that
with regular chewing gum as well.

624
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:03,692
Oh.

625
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:05,319
So what? Huh?

626
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:13,160
You think that…
bubble gum and chewing gum are different?

627
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,916
You keep chewing,
and you just blow bubbles all the same.

628
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,629
How do I say it?

629
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,969
Murder's just like that too.
It just happens.

630
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,559
You're not a witness, although…

631
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:40,062
when people are the last
to see a murder victim before they die,

632
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,815
they tend to suffer
from trauma afterwards.

633
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:45,693
I thought I might have
scared you too much earlier.

634
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:51,532
And judging by your looks
and your name, I get a feeling

635
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:55,578
that you might have it a bit rough
in life in general, and…

636
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:58,456
let me just say, I can sympathize.

637
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,207
Hmm?

638
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,668
JANG NAN-GAM
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

639
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,923
I became a cop
so people wouldn't think I'm a joke.

640
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,176
You get it, right?

641
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,389
Take care.

642
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,057
Thanks. Come again.

643
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,517
No, thanks.

644
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,853
You won't be seeing me again.

645
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:38,913
-<i>Have a good day!</i>
-Well, would you look at that?

646
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,123
You little fucking punk.

647
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,417
What are you doing here?

648
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,503
So, what's your deal?

649
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:48,214
You didn't answer my calls or texts.

650
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:51,550
Oh, I didn't tell you? My phone broke.

651
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:54,970
So then why haven't you had it fixed?
God.

652
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:57,181
Why aren't you going to school?

653
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,851
I have a family thing.

654
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:06,148
Hey… I heard some guys got killed
near here, bro.

655
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,651
Wanna hear something really funny?

656
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:12,947
Yesterday, after class,
a detective came to see me and Mi-yeong.

657
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,241
He was asking us a bunch of stuff.

658
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,660
He wanted to know
what you were up to that day.

659
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,328
It was intense as hell.

660
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,873
And it was almost
like he thought you were the murderer.

661
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,500
A professor walked by,

662
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,544
<i>and he was totally staring at us.</i>

663
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:29,255
I can't seem
to get drunk these days.

664
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,757
What is this, water?

665
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,343
Let's do another round.

666
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:38,430
It's been so hard to get drunk.
Like, especially today, even. Shit.

667
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:43,811
I drank with the guys a while back,
and I freaking destroyed them.

668
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,479
Drank, like, ten bottles.

669
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:47,523
Mm. Yeah, go ahead.

670
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,911
Detective Jang! Detective Jang!

671
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:08,877
<i>Breaking news.</i>

672
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:13,507
<i>In regards to the murder in an alley</i>
<i>in Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, a few days ago,</i>

673
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:18,304
<i>an investigation into the identity</i>
<i>of Mr. Kim, a victim of the case,</i>

674
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,306
<i>revealed him to be Kim Myeong-jin,</i>

675
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:22,683
<i>a construction worker</i>
<i>who lived in the area.</i>

676
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,894
<i>A closer analysis of his DNA revealed…</i>

677
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:28,981
-Kim Myeong-jin, who you said felt off?
-Yeah.

678
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:32,568
His age, history,
none of it was real.

679
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:34,278
I ran a background check,

680
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,655
and this man, it turns out, is Yeo Bu-il.

681
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,867
<i>It was actually a match</i>
<i>for that of Mr. Yeo,</i>

682
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:44,413
<i>the suspect in a serial murder</i>
<i>that took place in Gangwon-do in 2009.</i>

683
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,125
<i>The police found Kim's true identity</i>

684
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:50,961
<i>after they conducted</i>
<i>a more detailed DNA analysis</i>

685
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,213
<i>following suspicions about his records.</i>

686
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:57,343
<i>The discovery that Kim's DNA matched</i>
<i>that of the serial murder suspect, Yeo,</i>

687
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:00,638
<i>and the fact that he had been living</i>
<i>under an alias all this time</i>

688
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,681
<i>comes as a shock to many.</i>

689
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,975
Oh, oh, Yeo Bu-il!

690
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,770
-Ah!
-I wasn't sure either.

691
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,481
Then I recognized him right away
when I saw the picture.

<i>One of the characteristics of a psychopath</i>

694
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:19,573
<i>is that they are experts when it comes</i>
<i>to manipulation, deception, and disguises.</i>

695
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,828
Jesus, isn't it strange, huh?

696
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,706
It's like they say. What is it?

697
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,750
-Uh… comeuppance.

698
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,752
He got what was comin' to him.

699
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,921
<i>The discovery</i>
<i>that Kim was actually Yeo,</i>

'cause you killed a bad man?

705
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:12,960
Hey, part-timer.

706
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,379
The heart is

707
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:19,341
so very cunning, isn't it?

708
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:25,305
You murdered a family
for the insurance money.

709
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:29,351
Hid in a mountain, then raped and killed
college kids who went for a hike

710
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:30,978
before dumping their bodies.

711
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,731
And you say what?

712
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,745
I have an old mother at home.

713
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,079
And…

714
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:52,332
And I also have three kids.

715
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:55,544
I heard you went from place to place,
killing a fuckload of people.

716
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,298
Right up until you died in my hands!

717
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:04,428
There's a lot more that aren't
on the internet and news, aren't there?

718
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:06,847
And you say what?

719
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,266
The stuff about your mother
and kids was all bullshit!

720
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:11,810
They were all lies, weren't they? Huh?

721
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,086
Ooh!

722
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,213
There you go. Good job!

723
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:24,049
Good boy. Yeah.

724
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:26,093
Well done! Good!

725
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:28,095
One more time? Okay?

726
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,638
Here we go!

727
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:35,769
There you go. Good job!

728

One more. Go.
