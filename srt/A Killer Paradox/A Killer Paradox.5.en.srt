00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:12,053
LOOKING FOR THE SEX VIDEO OF THIS GIRL

2
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:16,182
DO YOU KNOW THIS GIRL?
IT'S HARD TO GET HER VIDEO

3
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,893
HEARD SHE KILLED HERSELF
YOU REALLY WANNA JACK OFF TO THIS?

4
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,312
BUT I SAW A PIC OF HER
WORKING AS A FLORIST

5
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:29,696
"Why can't you take my word for it
and just believe me? She's dead."

6
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:32,741
SHE'S DEAD. THE FLORIST THING IS A LIE.

7
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:31,216
A KILLER PARADOX

8
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:52,028
RESIDENT IDENTIFICATION CERTIFICATE
LEE GYEONG-SU

9
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,672
<i>Superman flies through the sky.</i>

10
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,591
<i>Spider-Man shoots out webs.</i>

11
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:18,555
<i>And Lee Tang carries out retribution.</i>

12
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:25,186
<i>Those who are detected on Lee Tang's radar</i>
<i>are all criminals</i>

13
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,688
<i>who dodged laws made by men.</i>

14
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,150
<i>-And deserved to die.</i>
-Bitch.

15
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,071
<i>-No, they're all human garbage.</i>
-What do you want?

16
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,656
Professor, please.

17
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:40,285
If you got pregnant, then you should've
gotten an abortion. So go!

18
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,537
It's your baby, though.

19
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,873
Stupid whore! How dare you?

20
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,875
MURDERED PROFESSOR WAS A KILLER

21
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:50,545
<i>Retribution isn't bound</i>
<i>by laws or ethics. It's pure and absolute.</i>

22
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,007
<i>A crime always leaves behind evidence,</i>

23
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,928
<i>but retribution is beyond</i>
<i>something humans can prove.</i>

24
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:03,141
<i>Emotions will get the better of</i>
<i>he who murders for vengeance,</i>

25
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:06,352
<i>and punishment</i>
<i>for those who murder in malice.</i>

26
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:14,068
<i>But Lee Tang's murders are not</i>
<i>swayed by emotions or punishment.</i>

27
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,946
<i>They are the essence of pure good</i>

28
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,574
<i>and absolute justice.</i>

29
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,622
<i>No one can take these criminals to trial,</i>

30
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,833
<i>but someone must act,</i>

31
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:33,546
<i>even though not a person</i>
<i>in the world will ever know about it.</i>

32
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,807
Gyeong-su, what'd you do
before this? Were you a student?

33
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,808
No.

34
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,436
You wanna open up your own store, or what?

35
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:49,854
No.

36
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:53,691
Oh… So, then, why'd you come
all this way out to Busan?

37
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:58,279
You know, these Gen Z kids hate it
when you bombard them with questions.

38
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,074
-That's not true. They enjoy it.
-You can just ignore her.

39
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,993
Gyeong-a, we're a family here.
Why are you acting this way?

40
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,913
Seon-gyeong is home until tomorrow
because she's sick.

41
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,748
I'm not asking for a huge favor.

42
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,919
Shouldn't you be hiring
a new cashier then, sir?

43
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:16,256
-Oh my God. There she goes again.
-Are you serious? Really?

44
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,217
-We need all the help we can get!
-Kids these days are all so rude.

45
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:23,346
-Doesn't care about anyone but herself.
-Come on, get serious.

46
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,597
-Honestly!
-Yes, but…

47
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:28,309
She's the worst. Since she started,
I don't think she's ever said hello.

48
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,353
And she never goes out with us.

49
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,273
Hey, the girl's probably
just busy with her boyfriend.

50
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,191
Are you making a fuss 'cause she's pretty?

51
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:39,112
Hah! What do you mean, pretty?
She's probably had her whole face done.

52
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:42,490
And what's the point of plastic surgery
when you're stuck in a warehouse?

53
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,909
Okay, I'll get it done after this.

54
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,953
It's always "after this." I'll do it.

55
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,163
No one's at the register. Get to it.

56
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,418
Please, okay? Thank you.

57
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,753
Oh, Seung-hun.

58
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,923
<i>"The homeroom rep</i>
<i>and Choi In-seon fought today."</i>

59
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,925
<i>"The homeroom rep totally made fun of her</i>

60
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,261
<i>and said the mole on her nose</i>
<i>looks like a weird booger."</i>

61
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:06,180
The homeroom rep had
a crush on her too.

62
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,849
A love triangle?

63
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,768
Pfft. That's adorable.

64
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:11,894
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED

65
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,813
THANK YOU FOR COMING TO CELEBRATE

66
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,359
<i>-Oppa.</i>
-Mm-hmm?

67
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,069
-When are you gonna be done?
-Oh, whoa!

68
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,863
-Do you still have a lot to do?
-Why?

69
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,740
-How much do you have left?
-Mm?

70
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,033
When will you be done?

71
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,702
I'm all done. I'm all done.

72
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,954
-Finished.
-Aren't I heavy?

73
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,666
Not at all. Why can't you
just leave me alone, hmm?

74
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,294
-Kiss me. Kiss me.
-What took you so long, huh?

75
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,157
Excuse me!

76
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:11,913
This is exactly like last time.
This supermarket has terrible service.

77
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:15,041
What, do you think your work's
done after you sell the goods? Huh?

78
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,919
Customers have to keep
a stupid file of receipts now?

79
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:21,297
You say you bought this three days ago?

80
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,674
Forget it, come on!
I'm busy. Just hurry already.

81
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,594
Hey, if you don't know, just ask. Come on!

82
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:30,431
I'm searching for the purchase
you made to print the receipt for you,

83
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,766
but I don't see it here.

84
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,018
What the hell are you mumbling about?

85
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:37,313
Where else do you think I would've bought
this crap, if it wasn't from here?

86
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:41,609
What are you looking at?
Don't give me that look, you little hussy!

87
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,403
Are you trying to pick a fight with me?

88
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,821
-Come on, then!
-Ma'am.

89
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,281
I'm sorry. I think she just
made a mistake.

90
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,784
-Give her a refund
-What's with this supermarket?

91
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,452
All I did was ask for a refund!

92
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,918
Ma'am, I'll make sure
this doesn't happen again. I'm so sorry.

93
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,004
Thank you for understanding.
Here, this is on the house.

94
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,172
I'm sorry again.

95
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,883
Drive safely.

96
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,519
What?

97
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,651
Hey. Hey, did you do
this to my windshield?

98
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:30,450
Have you completely
lost your damn mind? Huh?

99
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:31,993
Are you crazy?

100
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,288
I asked you a question! Jeez.

101
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:36,956
What if I didn't do it?

102
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,583
Will you say sorry?

103
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,293
What?

104
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,589
You shouldn't accuse
if you don't have any proof.

105
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,885
I guess you're too ignorant
and dumb to know better,

106
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,845
but you messed with the wrong lady.

107
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:55,099
I have a dashcam.
I'm not letting this slide.

108
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,269
-Are you nuts? Unbelievable!
-Fine, report it.

109
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:01,898
I'm sure the dashcam caught you stealing
from that pile and demanding a refund.

110
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,277
What?

111
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,988
Make your call.

112
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,365
I'm…

113
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,410
-Should I call?
-Hey. What are you doing?

114
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,332
-I don't have time for this!
-Well?

115
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,375
It's…

116
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,836
it's not that.

117
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,255
Then what? Huh?

118
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,175
You won't even answer the customers
when they ask a question.

119
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:31,093
Why do you act this way? Huh?

120
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,929
I told you about this last time.

121
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:33,930
I'm sorry.

122
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,080
-Fish section, right?
-Yeah.

123
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,461
Why'd you come here?

124
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,097
Listen.

125
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,100
I think you're a lot like me, actually.

126
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:21,894
I am?

127
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,818
You know, I've been noticing how…

128
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,863
how you change the subject
when they ask about your past,

129
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,116
and how you keep your
distance from others.

130
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,577
And you're probably in your 20s,

131
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,122
but got a job at a small supermarket
that's really far away.

132
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:42,999
Aah.

133
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:48,045
And, uh, you're rude to asshole customers.

134
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,171
I feel like…

135
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,674
like we have that in common.

136
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,430
I'm like that, huh?

137
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,058
Well, if not, forget it.

138
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,439
Aren't you tired of people here

139
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,234
being gossipy
and in your business all the time?

140
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,657
Although, they're not all that bad,
to be honest.

141
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,578
Mm… They normally nag
you and act annoying.

142
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:24,749
Except they usually quit
after the first month that you're here.

143
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,252
I didn't get to have that, though,

144
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,880
so it's hard.

145
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,344
What's that?

146
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,307
Well, being, I guess, normal.

147
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,559
I mean, living a normal life.

148
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,856
You know, I'm just kinda…

149
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,903
tired of having big dreams anymore.

150
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:58,908
Just… living an ordinary life
seems to be the key.

Hey, come help me with these.

Why'd you bring all this? You should've
just had it all shipped over.

163
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,399
The move must have you pretty busy.

164
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:16,110
Why ship it when I can just bring it?

165
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,821
How's that going?
Are you doing door-to-door service?

166

No. Don't you know

Gosh.
So, did Dad head there already?

171
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,585
What about In-jun?

172
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,879
They both went
to finish the greenhouse.

173
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,255
Check if that's yours.

174
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,507
Hey, what'd you bring these for?

175
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,137
What's this doing here?

176
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,973
I had it terminated
at the community service center.

177
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:49,185
Remember, you got another one
because you had lost it?

178
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,312
I found that one in the closet.

179
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,400
IDENTIFICATION
CHOI IN-SEON, CHOI GYEONG-A

180
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,359
Gyeong-a.

181
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,988
You'll visit us often, right?

182
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,365
Hmm?

183
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,368
You don't need a reason
to come home, you know.

184
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,164
Why are you suddenly bringing that up now?

185
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:15,085
We have a room for you in the new house.
Now you can visit whenever you want.

186
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,797
Think of it more like a fun sabbatical.

187
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,056
Hey.

188
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:31,477
Look at you. You're
glowin' after a little time off. Jesus.

189
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,689
You haven't even opened it.
Didn't you get that last summer?

190
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,694
You got a nice place,
but you need a woman in here.

191
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,530
Smells like a bachelor pad.

192
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,323
Whoa! What--

193
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,244
Hey, isn't this the…
the dog from that girl's case?

194
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,039
Dang, well, we can't just
send him away somewhere.

195
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,500
We can't put him down, either.

196
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,628
Should a detective raise a dog, though?

197
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,631
I brought him here
hoping he might bring me luck

198
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,092
with all of the ongoing investigations.

199
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:06,011
I'm just keeping him
until he's proven innocent.

200
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,765
Didn't you say you have some time
before you leave? Why are you here?

201
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,936
Well, it's what's-his-face.

202
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,146
Right, Roh Bin.

203
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,274
Don't go near him, all right?

204
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,318
It's thanks to the captain
you only got a restraining order.

205
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,822
If he decides to press charges
against you, your ass is done for, buddy.

206
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:28,701
How am I supposed to investigate when
I can't even get his security cam footage?

207
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,203
You came here to tell me that?

208
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,456
No. Listen.

209
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,083
You…

210
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,295
Look, why aren't
you answering anybody's calls?

211
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,089
Did Yong-jae say I wasn't pickin' up?

212
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,925
He keeps on callin' me
'cause you never answer.

213
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:45,885
So?

214
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,471
-So I told him to come.
-Come where? Here?

215
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,266
-Now?
-Yeah.

216
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,809
You owe me, sir.

217
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,813
I'm really sorry
about the Kang Sang-muk incident.

218
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,441
And I only received a warning
because you kept me in the dark

219
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,776
about the situation
at Roh Bin's house, right?

220
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,945
But if you had trusted me, sir,

221
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,197
and shared information
for the investigation,

222
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:10,910
we might've caught both Lee Tang
and that nerd without getting suspended.

223
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,370
I'm so frustrated that I can't even sleep.

224
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,124
I'm gonna catch that asshole, sir.

225
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:24,673
Look how much he has to say.
Imagine how upset he was you ignored him.

226
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,301
There you go. Good.

227
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:31,513
Imagine that there's a line between here,
and cut across in one go.

228
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,140
That's it! Yeah, great.

229
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,558
-Look at that.
-Oh, God.

230
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:38,062
He just needs to clean. What the heck
are you teaching him all that for?

231
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,521
You should come check him out.

232
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,066
He got the bones out perfectly.

233
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,735
This right here is not an easy task.

234
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,154
-Yeah, he's okay.
-This is how you learn.

235
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,031
It's awkward and kinda tricky at first,

236
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,576
but then, after a little practice,
you get used to it, hmm?

237
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,912
You keep goin' like that,

238
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,456
and you'll be able
to open up a shop in no time.

239
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,666
So keep at it, kid.

240
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,935
<i>Heard about</i>
<i>Professor No's murder in Busan?</i>

241
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,354
Yeah.

242
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:23,774
When he disappeared that day,
he moved to Busan. Lee Tang.

243
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:26,568
Hmm.

244
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,154
Oh, we found this by chance
while working on another case.

245
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,448
-Huh! Chance, my ass.
-Well, did you know?

246
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,492
Hey, look at this.

247
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:37,496
This right here is
the murder of a drug dealer in Busan,

248
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,374
and this, over here,
is the loan shark murder case.

249
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,460
Hey, that…
that guy was murdered by a junkie,

250
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,921
and the other guy died in a gang fight.

251
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,173
And they couldn't find the culprit
for either case.

252
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,343
So, what are you gonna do, then?
Do you even have a warrant?

253
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,679
I know.

254
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:56,348
We should go to Busan first.

255
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:01,145
The cases in Daejeon are all closed now.
And we don't have an APB on him.

256
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,732
Are you any good with emotional appeals?

257
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,403
If I were the one reading this letter,

258
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,656
I'd feel worried and perplexed also, yeah.

259
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,784
-They told us he's an adult.
-Yeah.

260
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,620
That he said
he was planning to take a working holiday,

261
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,372
and that he even left a letter.

262
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:24,168
So they suggested that we report him
as a runaway, not as missing.

263
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,711
-Mm-hmm.
-So we just left.

264
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:26,837
Yes, um…

265
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:31,133
I want you to know
that you can legally report him missing.

266
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,845
What? I don't get it. What's going on?

267
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:38,849
How come the cops are saying two different
things about the same exact case?

268
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:41,060
-Do they have different laws?
-This must be confusing--

269
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,021
-Honey, no, please. I--
-They want to help us, all right? Please.

270
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:47,107
-So, what is it that you'd like from us?
-Uh-huh.

271
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,611
Uh, well, you can start
by reporting him missing again to me.

272
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,573
If there's even a small chance
that someone is connected to a crime,

273
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,325
then you can report them missing.

274
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,284
-That's even--
-Wait.

275
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:01,413
-Are you telling us he's a victim?
-No, that's not exactly what I'm saying.

276
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,541
-What are you saying?
-Are you saying he committed a crime?

277
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,501
-Uh…
-Hmm?

278
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,920
As you can see right here, very well,

279
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,672
he even asked
if we could use his security deposit

280
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,466
to pay the store owner.

281
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,051
-That's who he is.
-Yes. I see.

282
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,804
-How can a kid like that commit a crime?
-Yes, I'm saying your son--

283
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,389
What about… What do you call it?
Uh, voice phishing?

284
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:22,726
-Or a cult or something? Is that what he--
-Ah, no, sir, it's not that.

285
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,311
-You don't--
-Stop talking nonsense!

286
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:27,481
So, what I think is
you need to find your son.

287
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:28,649
-Of course.
-Yeah.

288
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,943
-That is the most crucial thing right now.
-Exactly.

289
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,152
-Right.
-This is frustrating.

290
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,572
All right, guys. Let's just
hear them out first. You…

291
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,575
You're not here to help us, are you?

292
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,454
-I, uh… We'll help you find--
-No.

293
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:43,997
No.

294
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,545
We've actually come here
to ask you for your help.

295
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,842
Then please, just be honest with us here.

296
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,302
And then we'll make a decision.

297
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:03,392
Like your mom said,
he doesn't have the guts to do that. Huh?

298
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,353
-Mm…
-I know exactly how these cops operate.

299
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,189
They go poking around
just based on a hunch.

300
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,358
Don't worry too much.

301
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,694
I thought they were strange too.

302
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,113
How could they think…

303
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,949
This whole thing's just ridiculous.

304
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,993
Mom has a good point.

305
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,828
Uh, Ma, I'm gonna go, okay?

306
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,205
-Can you take a look at this for me?
-Hmm?

307
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,458
Do you get something like this
even if you're abroad?

308
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,544
RESERVE FORCES TRAINING NOTIFICATION

310
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,630
Mm, this is delicious.

311
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,382
Your dad hates this type of food.

312
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,177
I only eat at places like this with you.

313
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,721
Well, enjoy. You still
have time before your train.

314
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,639
-Hmm?
-Your brother's just like your dad.

315
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,309
He never takes me to nice places.

316
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:48,020
-My daughter's the best.
-I wonder what it'll be tomorrow.

317
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,730
You're addicted at this point.

318
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,649
Seriously.

319
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,942
No, I'm not.

320
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,905
Ugh. It's seven already.
I really don't wanna go back to Seoul.

321
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,198
-Drink water.
-I--

322
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,617
Eat while it's hot.

323
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,831
I'm sorry about this.

324
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,169
I tried,
but I just can't let this one slide.

325
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:18,967
Hey.

326
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:22,137
-Wait, aren't you--
-What are you staring at? Hmm?

327
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:26,767
What's mesmerizing enough to make you
keep staring at someone while they eat?

328
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,977
-What is it?
-No, no, I'm not--

329
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,898
Seeing a girl from a sex video
in real life got you turned on? That it?

330
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,692
-Wait, uh, that's not why I stared.
-Oh, no?

331
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,780
Why, huh? You little shits
can't even talk about it outright.

332
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,991
-I thought you were someone I knew.
-Yes, I'm her.

333
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:46,995
-I'm the girl in the video.
-No, that's not… It's just, uh…

334
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,540
You went to Kwonseong Elementary.

335
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,544
Aren't you Choi In-seon?

336
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,631
It's me, Ha Sang-min.

337
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,094
Well, um…

338
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,722
Your mom,
she owned the snack shop near school.

339
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,183
Yeah. And she looked familiar, so…

340
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:15,107
Mm.
So, when did you come down to Busan?

341
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:20,153
It was about, um,
this time last year, I think, so…

342
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,114
-I see.
-I'm going back to Seoul next year.

343
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:26,660
Oh, you are?
Still, you were here for a while. Mm.

344
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,875
Did something go down?
I hadn't heard anything, but…

345
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,713
Yeah, you heard it tonight, already.

346
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,216
So, that's that. Mm.

347
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,177
Hmm.

348
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:50,600
You, um, removed your mole, didn't you?

349
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,269
Ah, that's right.

350
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,813
That was the first thing
I took care of.

351
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,280
Oh, booger face!

352
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,116
Wait, you don't remember?

353
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,076
What did you say?

354
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,163
-Booger face! You know?
-What?

355
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,541
I recently read my childhood journal,
a little while ago,

356
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,169
and, um… I had written about you.

357
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,504
And it reminded me
of that little booger joke.

358
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,048
What?

359
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:25,510
Ah, come on.
How come you still have that old journal?

360
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,597
It's nice to walk down memory lane.

361
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,144
Right by the beach. Nice.

362
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:37,481
Thanks for the ride.
I can get home by myself from here.

363
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,816
-Mm.
-Sorry about earlier today.

364
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,984
No, it's cool.

365
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,653
Hey, is it okay if we stay in touch?

366
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,531
Oh… actually…

367
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,869
Let's not see each other anymore.
I think I'd be more comfortable with that.

368
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,955
I gotta go. See ya.

369
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:55,874
Bye.

370
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,350
How can I help you, ma'am?

371
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:16,561
Hello.

372
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,022
Hi, ma'am. Thanks for coming.

373
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,026
-We brought you this.
-Oh, right, right. Thank you.

374
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,368
REQUESTING COOPERATION
IN MISSING PERSON SEARCH

375
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,858
Lee Tang. Lee Tang?
His name is Lee Tang?

376
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,735
-Yeah.
-That's a pretty unique name, huh?

377
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:11,491
So this kid who went AWOL in Daejeon,
this is the guy who killed No Ui-cheol?

378
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,492
Yes.

379
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:16,163
We realize you're busy, but could you
please help us out just this once?

380
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,665
Yeah, we are very busy.

381
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,545
And regarding
Professor No Ui-cheol's murder,

382
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,173
we're doing everything we can right now.

383
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:29,134
We identified a suspect
who he's on bad terms with.

384
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:32,971
-Our boys are out on a stakeout now.
-I see.

385
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:35,640
They're practically living at the station
and the scene,

386
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,726
trying to find the murder weapon
and witnesses,

387
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:41,104
really giving it their all,
and their wives want 'em back already.

388
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:42,814
And…

389
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:46,401
And now, you come in here saying
this missing person is a suspect.

390
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,112
Without any leads.
Wouldn't that put us in a tough position--

391
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:52,782
We have an official document issued
for your cooperation, so…

392
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,286
We'd appreciate if you would work with us.

393
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,079
-Yes, but we're busy--
-All right.

394
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,250
We just have to let you know
if something comes up with those murders?

395
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,835
Yeah. Uh, no.

396
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,588
We'd really appreciate it if, uh…

397
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:11,676
if you could share information
about any unnatural deaths too.

398
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,512
-Everything?
-Yeah.

399
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,532
All I've ever done is work.

400
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,991
That's not a sin.

401
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,079
My daughter just started middle school.

402
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,790
What did I do wrong? Huh?

403
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:43,917
Answer me, you bitch.

404
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,129
For fuck's sake, man.

405
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,176
These pricks are impossible.

406
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:06,982
Whoops.

407
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,739
How long do you think you can evade us?

408
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,123
Yeah, hello?

409
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:49,584
<i>Gyeong-a, it's Sang-min.</i>

410
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,836
<i>We hung out a few days ago.</i>

411
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,256
<i>Can you talk for a second?</i>

412
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:58,218
How were you able to find my number?

413
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:02,180
<i>Well, I asked some of our friends</i>
<i>if they had it,</i>

414
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:06,476
<i>and then I asked around to some</i>
<i>other people from elementary school.</i>

415
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:13,650
I thought I was clear.
I don't want to talk to you.

416
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,320
<i>But there's something I need to tell you.</i>

417
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,406
What is it?

418
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,035
<i>I got sextorted.</i>

419
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,079
<i>I…</i>

420
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:30,041
<i>I have no idea what to do right now.</i>

421
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:34,796
Just tell me the truth.
How did you find my number, really?

422
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:41,010
Well, I was desperate… to get your number,

423
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:44,389
so I asked my cop friend for it.

424
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:48,435
I realize it was wrong.

425
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:55,400
It was my only option.
I thought you could help.

426
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,738
'Cause I thought
this could really be the end.

427
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,492
It's not like

428
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,411
I can just

429
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:08,955
go to Seoul or anything.

430
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:12,292
I can't even contact my parents right now.

431
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,460
It's awful.

432
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,129
I just…

433
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,426
Right, that's a good call.

434
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,388
It's expensive,
but hiring a private service is better.

435
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,183
And cops are just not reliable.

436
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,644
My girlfriend wanted to end things.

437
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:33,813
So we did.

438
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,067
I don't know what to tell my parents.

439
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,780
That's it.

440
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:46,201
Just be thankful that it hasn't
gotten out any more than it has.

441
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:50,789
So, how did you get through it?

442
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,207
Huh?

443
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,252
How did you get over it?

444
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:02,926
Get over it? Yeah.

445
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,303
You saw me the other day.

446
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,642
I'm suspicious of every man
who looks in my direction.

447
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,353
"Has he already seen my video?"

448
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,898
So, yeah.

449
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:21,653
I still haven't really gotten over it,
exactly.

450
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,831
Gyeong-a.

451
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,291
Hmm?

452
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,421
You can't blame yourself for it.
You just can't.

453
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,261
You're doing really great.

454
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,373
Hey, since you drove here,
you can go when you're sober.

455
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,042
-Here, if you wanna shower.
-Right, thanks.

456
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,577
You wanna sleep here?

457
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:04,797
Babe, did something good happen?
Why do you look like that?

458
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,258
It's nothing. I'm just happy.

459
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,344
What?

460
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,555
What's with you?

461
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,768
-It's good.
-Going back in two days?

462
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:19,062
-I think I'm going tomorrow.
-Again?

463
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:22,690
Mm-hmm. The boss asked me
to work and help him out.

464
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,609
So I said I would.

465
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:29,405
It sucks, but we're getting married soon,
so I should be diligent.

466
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:33,201
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine.

467
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,331
I'll take you someplace nice
next time.

468
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,754
Hey. Open up your trunk.

469
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,256
-Why?
-Just open it.

470
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,758
Why?

471
00:32:58,601 --> 00:32:59,477
<i>Oppa!</i>

472
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,188
-What?
<i>-</i>Why'd you lie to me?

473
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,940
You've got a terrible poker face.

474
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,443
-I wasn't lying.
-You could've said you were going fishing.

475
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:10,154
I wouldn't have gotten angry.
I'm really not that petty.

476
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,323
Just go.

477
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:15,326
Go have fun with your friends, okay?

478
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:21,582
-I just didn't wanna hurt your feelings.
<i>-Oppa! </i>Let's always be honest, okay?

479
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,752
I want us to tell the truth
to avoid issues down the line.

480
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,546
-All right?
-Yes. You're right.

481
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,674
We're getting married,
so I'll let this one go.

482
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,760
You won't find a girl like me.
Treat me right!

483
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,137
Okay, I'll do better.

484
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,263
Let's go!

485
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,729
I'm here
to get groceries with the guys. Yeah.

486
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,940
Yeah, I miss you too, babe.

487
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:50,528
I found a coffee shop here
that you'd love. It even has a terrace.

488
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,405
Yes.

489
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,533
I love you too. Bye.

490
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,910
I'll call you back, okay?

491
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,871
Bye.

492
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,497
Gyeong-a.

493
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:03,207
Gyeong-a.

494
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,336
What? I thought
you said you were in Seoul.

495
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,047
I wanted to surprise you.

496
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,168
Oh…

497
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:31,754
The warmth
of another person's embrace.

498
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,298
I don't know
how I've gone so long without it.

499
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:35,800
Mm-hmm.

500
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:41,472
It's really amazing
how childhood friends can fall in love.

501
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,355
Should I

502
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,359
come back with you when you go to Seoul?

503
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:58,781
Seoul?

504
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:00,700
Mm-hmm.

505
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:05,079
Well, you live in Seoul, so I…

506
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:06,873
Hang on.

507
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,224
I'm tired.

508
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,858
NOT BAD
BUT WHY IS THE VIDEO SO SHORT?

509
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,822
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED

510
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,532
THANK YOU FOR COMING TO CELEBRATE

511
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,868
What are you doing?

512
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,120
Give me back my phone.

513
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,788
What are you doing?

514
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,499
What the hell?

515
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:54,879
Didn't you say that you…

516
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,132
…broke up with your girlfriend?

517
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,346
I was gonna tell you.

518
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,805
-I didn't get a chance.
-When?

519
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,058
I was gonna tell you.

520
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:10,603
I thought you were going out with me
because you already ended things.

521
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:13,773
Listen, In-seon.

522
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:17,193
-It's Gyeong-a now!
-Okay, fine, I know! Gyeong-a, come on!

523
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,320
I'm telling you now!

524
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:22,073
Telling me what, exactly?

525
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:25,618
Just tell me
everything you lied about right now.

526
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:28,579
What's really going on here?

527
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,528
Oh, now we're in business.

528
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,325
DELIVERY
MS. CHOI GYEONG-A

529
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:12,498
This camera's great. Honey!

530
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:15,543
-Look over here.
-What are you doing?

531
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,004
You know. Come on, it's fun.

532
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:20,840
What? Is this a video? Stop it.

533
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:23,009
-<i>What?</i>
-Oh, my In-seon.

534
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,012
-<i>We're making memories.</i>
-<i>Just for us?</i>

535
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,513
So she wanted to?

536
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,776
Did you really get sextorted?

537
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,737
Why would
you look at my phone? Fuck.

538
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,114
Tell me if that was real or not,
right now.

539
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:46,407
All right, yeah.

540
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,117
I made it up to sleep with you.

541
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,499
You don't see me as a human. Is that it?

542
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,960
-I'm just a piece of meat?
-Ugh, fucking bitch.

543
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,338
-That you fuck and just walk away? Huh?
-Hey!

544
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,673
-Listen, God damn it! Now!
-What? What? What?

545
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,925
-You knew I had a girlfriend!
-What?

546
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:08,095
Hey! You invited me into your bed!
So stop whining, you bitch.

547
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,389
You said you broke up with her!

548
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,600
-Shut the fuck up.
-Fine. All right, fine.

549
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,935
Let's say I knew.
Does your girlfriend know?

550
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:18,272
-Does she know you're having sex with me?
-Are you seriously threatening me?

551
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,441
-Do your colleagues know?
-So you're threatening me?

552
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,026
Yes, I am. Where's your phone?

553
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:25,404
-Your girlfriend and friends should know!
-Stop that.

554
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,948
You stupid little bitch.

555
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,576
You fucking asshole!

556
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:33,204
For fuck's sake!

557
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:34,163
Hey!

558
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:36,207
Hey, stop it.

559
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,250
You fucking little bitch.

560
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:40,544
Shut the fuck up.

561
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,463
You fucking bitch!

562
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,800
Shit! Can't you…

563
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:00,272
CHOI IN-SEON, CHOI GYEONG-A

564
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,710
Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no.

565
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,879
What do I do? What do I do? What the fuck?

566
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,756
<i>The exact cause of the fire</i>
<i>and the number of casualties</i>

567
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,758
<i>is still currently being investigated.</i>

568
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:13,512
<i>The fire department sent 12 firefighters</i>
<i>and used several pieces of equipment</i>

569
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,181
<i>as soon as they received the report</i>

570
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,516
<i>and were able to extinguish the fire</i>
<i>within one hour.</i>

571
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,187
<i>They have said that the cause of the fire</i>
<i>is still under investigation.</i>

572
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:24,064
<i>Busanjin Police Station</i>
<i>identified the victim</i>

573
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,276
<i>as a 29-year-old female</i>
<i>residing in Gyeongnam.</i>

574
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:31,071
<i>Based on witness statements</i>
<i>and the security camera footage--</i>

575
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:35,701
-<i>Around 5:00 a.m. today…</i>
-Isn't that our neighborhood?

576
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:40,372
-Hang on. Where did you say that was?
-It's across from Gujeon Church.

577
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,749
-Gujeon Church.
-Gujeon?

578
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:46,045
-Yeah. I heard the lady lived alone.
-Oh wow. This is awful.

579
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,922
Know what else I heard? She was murdered.

580
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,340
-Come on!
-Really?

581
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:51,425
-Uh-huh.
-Stop spreading ridiculous rumors.

582
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,969
Neighbors heard her
fighting with someone all night.

583
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,387
-No way.
-Who said that?

584
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,306
Do-jun's mother.

585
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:01,060
You know that woman's always full of crap
and making stuff up.

586
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,772
-Well, I don't totally believe her.
-See? Even you're not sure.

587
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,608
-My God.
-I know. So tragic.

588
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,401
Let it go.

589
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,115
Well, then<i>.</i>

590
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,992
<i>…possibility of the fire being arson…</i>

591
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,328
How much do you believe her?

592
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,121
<i>-The city of Busan is…</i>
-Huh?

593
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,626
VICTIM CHOI GYEONG-A

594
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,420
Well, it seems like
the girl was just drunk

595
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:31,882
and just forgot to turn off the stove
before she went to bed.

596
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,552
Also, we, uh,
looked through her call history,

597
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,595
and she only kept in touch
with her parents.

598
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:40,849
The other people on the list were,
uh, just… What was it? Her coworkers…

599
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:43,018
-Oh, yeah, and the delivery man.
-Who is this?

600
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,937
-I think…
-It's her friend.

601
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,981
He didn't call on the day of the incident.

602
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:50,609
So chances of her being a murder victim
are low,

603
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,112
but we're doing an autopsy, so we'll see.

604
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:54,697
Can we start the investigation?

605
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,324
-What investigation? We have no warrant.
-There are procedures.

606
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,494
I'm saying we should be open
to the idea that this was actually murder.

607
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,496
Okay? I wanted you to share everything.

608
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,165
You think all dead bodies
are murders cases?

609
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,584
-God!
-Fuck! Shit.

610
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,302
Hey, Gyeong-su. There you are.

611
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,637
-Hey, give me the phone.
-Here.

612
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:23,517
You know, uh, that girl, right?

613
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:26,061
Yeah, you know her. Gyeong-a.

614
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:27,980
Why? What's going on?

615
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:28,939
BODY FOUND

616
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:29,940
This is her.

617
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,777
Apparently, she, uh… died.

618
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,404
-Hey. Come here.
-Huh?

619
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,406
Yeah. Okay. Get to work.

620
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:39,742
All right. Come on, guys.

621
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,452
Enough with this, already, huh?

622
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:43,704
Now, we should just…

623
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:48,208
-Yes, great job.
-No, look…

624
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:55,007
Maybe next week.

625
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,459
-Wait here.
-Yes, sir.

626
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:34,004
Where is he?

627
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:37,383
-Wait, why's he looking for him?
-He's police.

628
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,450
Hey, where you going?

629
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:14,920
Oh! Ah!

630
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,966
Lee Tang.

631
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:26,515
I can't believe how sloppy you are.

632
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,857
You know the case in Gujeon-dong?

633
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,026
It was you, huh?

634
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,098
Oh, stand up, huh?

635
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,393
We gotta go somewhere now.

636
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:16,565
There's a lot we gotta talk about, kid.

637
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:18,817
Just the two of us.

638
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,067
-I manage the security cameras.
-Yong-jae.

639
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,443
-What's wrong?
-Hey.

640
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:04,655
-Someone stole the security footage drive.
-The cameras?

641
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,615
-Yeah.
-You got a manual for this?

642
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:08,659
-Let me see the photo.
-Who's in charge?

643
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,369
I manage it all.

644
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:13,163
-They're just for monitoring employees.
-Have you seen this person?

645
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,374
Is this Gyeong-su?

646
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:19,253
-I think he works here.
-He works here? Do you have his address?

647
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:21,880
-Yeah, I have it.
-Let's go here first.

648
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,675
Hey, hold on.
This isn't your turf.

649
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,760
He's a murder suspect.
We should visit him.

650
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,470
Are you kidding me right now?

651
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:29,972
Listen, man.

652
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:33,433
I did some digging, and apparently,
you got suspended in Daejeon.

653
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,812
I looked the other way since you're
one of us, but stay in your lane.

654
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:39,022
I was looking into a guy in a murder case.

655
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,358
-I was suspended--
-How can we trust a suspended detective?

656
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,151
What's not to trust?
I have no reason to lie.

657
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:44,903
Besides, we got nothin' to lose anymore.

658
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:48,574
-There are procedures and orders we need--
-Stop it. Come on.

659
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:50,534
This man.

660
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,662
You're sure that he's your employee?

661
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:55,455
Yeah, in the fish section.

662
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,584
Okay. I say we all go.

663
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,752
Follow me.

664
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:02,921
What?

665
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,691
Look at this punk.

666
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,581
-Kwak, go and see Ha Sang-min.
-Yes, sir.

667
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:40,000
-The delivery man, as well.
-Okay, you got it.

668
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:43,420
-You get all footage near the house.
-Hey. Come here.

669
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:47,049
Follow Detective Kwak's interviews.

670
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,134
-Not Lee Tang?
-I'll do that.

671
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:51,970
Stay close with them
and report back on what they're all up to.

672
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:54,014
-…all needs to be done now.
-Hurry.

673
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,849
-Come on.
-Uh, okay. I'll call you.

674
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:02,105
It's called <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i>.

675
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,358
You have heard of gonorrhea, haven't you?

676
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:09,279
It's a bacteria,
transmitted through sexual intercourse.

677
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:14,576
But there's no need to worry.
It can be fully cured with antibiotics.

678
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:19,373
Oh, and no sexual intercourse
for the time being.

679
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,628
I was in bed sick.

680
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:30,175
Honey, I got some not great news.

681
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:31,635
<i>Babe, wait</i>.

682
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:34,137
<i>No, let me… let me talk first.</i>

683
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,347
Hmm? What is it?

684
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:38,475
<i>I have gonorrhea.</i>

685
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,352
<i>Just how…</i>

686
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:43,605
I wanted to bring it up to you first, but…

687
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:48,402
-Hmm.
<i>-I'm so sorry, baby.</i>

688
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:51,947
<i>It was a mistake. It only happened once.</i>

689
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,741
-What are you saying?
<i>-I wasn't even gonna go.</i>

690
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,660
<i>But my friends were insisting</i>

691
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:59,121
<i>I'm not gonna have fun anymore</i>
<i>once I'm married.</i>

692
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:02,040
<i>They literally just dragged me along.</i>

693
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:04,042
Oppa, <i>I'm so sorry.</i>

694
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,171
<i>It was really just a stupid mistake.</i>

695
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:11,133
Wow.

696
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:13,552
-You're a fucking bitch.
<i>-What?</i>

697
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:15,887
-Huh.
<i>-Oh…</i>

698
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:18,140
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

699
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,976
Hey, Hyeon-ji.

700
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:25,522
-Just fuck off.
-Oppa--

701
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:26,773
Shit, man.

702
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:40,746
Mr. Ha Sang-min?

703
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:43,415
-Yes?
-Ah.

704
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:49,838
You know Choi Gyeong-a. Isn't that right?

705
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:54,176
-Yeah.
-And you went to Gujeon-dong.

706
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:55,177
Yeah.

707
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:58,805
-And you slept with her.
-Yes.

708
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,767
-But you didn't kill her?
-Right.

709
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:04,061
Hmm.

710
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:07,564
So you found out
from the news she was dead?

711
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,690
Yes.

712
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:12,277
That so?

713
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,740
Why was she killed?

714
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:23,663
Because, from what I heard, there were
sounds of fighting at her apartment.

715
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:26,792
Uh…

716
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:30,295
At what time?

717
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:33,799
I don't know, um… anything about that.

718
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,304
From now on,

719
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,140
let's not lie anymore.

720
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,602
Unless you wanna
complicate the matter at hand.

721
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:50,899
Oh. I… I remember now. I, uh…

722
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:57,155
Actually, I'd started dated Gyeong-a
while I had a girlfriend still.

723
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:00,033
And Gyeong-a had known that
going into the relationship.

724
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:05,956
But… she eventually happened to learn
that I, uh…

725
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:09,501
-Uh… was actually engaged… to her.
-Okay.

726
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:12,129
-Ah.
-So, that…

727
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:17,217
I guess it made her feel lied to,
and she raised her voice.

728
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,136
-Aah.
-That brought on an argument.

729
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,220
And?

730
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,639
You beat her head in? Like that?

731
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:25,600
What are you… No.

732
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:32,941
I really didn't kill her.

733
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:37,237
Oh, you son of a bitch.
You fucking asshole.

734
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,656
I was thinking about setting you free.

735
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,746
Shameless. It's true, huh?

736
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:50,917
Almost had me fooled.
You're so, so brazen.

737
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,586
Do you have a warrant for that?

738
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:55,088
-A what?
-I said, do you have a warrant for that?

739
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:56,756
Right.

740
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:58,550
-Uh…
-What?

741
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:01,678
I'd like my attorney present
for when you take my statement.

742
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:05,265
It's always you half-assed idiots, huh?

743
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,058
-Huh?
-I want my lawyer.

744
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:09,311
Run your mouths, hmm?

745
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:11,104
It's fine. You won't get caught.

746
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:14,566
I didn't even kill her. Fuck.

747
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,779
But… I kinda ran away.

748
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:23,450
If what you're saying is true,
I should stay in Busan.

749
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:26,578
Now it's different.

750
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:29,039
<i>That hunch you felt</i>
<i>could be part of your powers.</i>

751
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:32,542
But if you feel that way again,
you gotta be cautious.

752
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:37,130
You should probably lay low.
Don't contact me. Turn your phone off.

753
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,674
I'll see what I can do, okay?

754
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:49,643
Let's see…

755
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:55,690
Ugh, come on.

756
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:59,527
Why isn't there any paper
in this dumb, shitty house?

757
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:02,280
You're not…
you're not a cop, are you?

758
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:06,618
I am.

759
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,578
Well, used to be.

760
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,789
Why… why are you doing this?

761
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,462
All right, let me ask you a question.

762
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:20,423
There's this

763
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:22,801
bastard I'm trying to locate.

764
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:25,053
That dumbass

765
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:29,057
somehow zeroes in on shitheads like you

766
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,351
and kills them, huh?

767
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:33,395
Then, shouldn't he be

768
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:38,316
already well on his way,
you little shit stain?

769
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:43,238
This is boring.

770
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:46,950
So boring.

771
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:14,060
Will you not kill me
if I tell you the truth?

772
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:17,272
What?

773
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:25,739
Will I keep you alive, you said?

774
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:27,240
Yes.

775
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:32,662
So you admit you killed her, then?

776
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:37,125
Yeah.

777
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:39,878
All right, go ahead.

778
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:42,797
Write it.

779
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:49,554
Uh…

780
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:53,308
Choi In-seon…

781
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:59,731
I, HA SANG-MIN, MURDERED CHOI IN-SEON,
AND I SHOW MY REMORSE THROUGH DEATH

782
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:00,732
Huh.

783
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:06,780
He didn't say how he killed Gyeong-a.

784
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:09,074
God.

785
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,327
Can't do much writing now.

786
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:14,579
Shit.

787
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:20,502
God, he just has no common sense.

788
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:25,799
Apology letters should always state
the when, why, and how.

789
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:28,426
Damn millennials.

790
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:40,855
<i>This is the apartment</i>
<i>management office.</i>

791
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:44,943
<i>There was a fire recently due to</i>
<i>an induction cooktop in one of the units.</i>

792
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:46,945
<i>When leaving the house, please be sure</i>

793
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:50,115
<i>to turn off the cooktop</i>
<i>or unplug it entirely.</i>

794
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:53,076
<i>Additionally, do not leave</i>
<i>paper towels near the cooktop,</i>

795
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:54,369
<i>as it may cause a fire.</i>

796
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,636
That Lee Tang, or Lee Gyeong-su,

797
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:14,055
he's probably already left Busan.

798
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:16,599
He had to have left some clues behind.

799
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:17,892
Something helpful.

800
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:22,021
That's true. He didn't have time
to stop at his house.

801
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,815
There's gotta be something there.

802
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:07,859
Anyone there?

803
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:11,696
Hello?

804
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:16,493
Anyone home?

805
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:21,164
Is this the management office?

806
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:25,960
It's the police.
Where's the master key for this place?

807
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:28,922
Huh?

808
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:31,925
It was stolen? By who?

809
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:33,968
What do you mean?

810
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:37,430
Don't you hear that sound?

811
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:40,183
No, what sound? I don't hear it.

812
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:55,698
FUEL
DO NOT HEAT

813
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:03,414
What the…
What's with all this smoke?

814
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,752
Is that from a fire extinguisher?

815
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,006
Has he been by already?
