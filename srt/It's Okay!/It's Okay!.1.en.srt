Please take your seats,

00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:12,506
the performance will begin
in 15 minutes.

00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,941
Welcome to Yookgomu,

4
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,645
a Korean traditional drum dance
by Seoul International Arts.

00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:22,482
In case of emergencies,
emergency exits are located...

6
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,194
Mom, didn't you pack my
new dance shoes?

7
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,463
I only have what I used
for practice.

8
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,998
I told you to get them

9
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:39,800
from the shoe cabinet.

10
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,305
But I asked you to put
them in my bag!

11
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:47,007
I need them for today's show!

12
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:49,676
That's right! I'm sorry.

13
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:52,612
I've been so busy at work.
It slipped my mind.

14
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,381
Because you always put

15
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,249
your work before me.

16
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:58,418
I'm sorry, In-young.
Next time--

17
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,153
Whatever.
I have to go now.

18
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,222
You'll do great--

19
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:13,500

20
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,604
Hi, Ms. Shin!

21
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:20,140
I'm just a few minutes away.

22
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:36,523
One minute to curtain.

23
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,287
It's time, ma'am.

24

(Incoming call Mom)

25
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:46,046
(It's Okay!)

(One year later)

27
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:28,555
Okay, one more wear!

(Youngwoon High School)

29
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:38,364
What's this?

30
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,366
Didn't shower again?

31
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:41,768
Your hair looks greasy.

32
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,337
And your hair looks like
a lego hairpiece.

33
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,306
- Warm, isn't it?
- Sure.

34
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,209
- You sprayed cologne on it?
- Smells nice, right?

35
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,911
Not to me. It's tacky.

36
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,213
Just keep it on.

37
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,716
Just so we're clear,
I'm not that cold.

38
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,085
People tend to see things
subjectively,

39
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,353
and that's what you're doing.

40
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,590
You thought I'd be cold
because you feel cold.

41
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,091
But I don't want to argue,

42
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,559
so I'll allow it.

43
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,462
That was a mouthful.
So you're wearing it?

44
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:10,797
- Yup.
- Let's go.

45
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,307
And you wonder why your
costume is tight.

46
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,444
Hey, I'm still a growing
young woman.

47
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,246
I'll take those if you're done.

48
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:31,584
Na-ri, how are you so thin
when you eat so much?

49
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:32,886
How?

50
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,187
Beats me.

51
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:35,955
Woah.

52
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,991
Look at her.
Her mouth is huge.

53
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,193
She eats so much.

54
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,098
That's enough for two.

55
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:46,933
How come she's so thin?

56
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,268
It's all tucked away.

57
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:51,604
She'd better have rolls of fat
hidden in those clothes.

58
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,708
I'm done.

59
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,282
Na-ri's so lucky.

60
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:03,616
Such a great dancer, too.

61
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:06,653
She has to be good,
since her mom's so strict.

62
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,987
It's sad, really.

63
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,123
Right. Let's just be average.

64
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,458
I'm happy with average.

65
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:14,761
I'm so full.

66
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,731
Then why won't you
stop eating?

67
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,166
Because it's lonely.

68
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,354
What are you doing?

69
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:42,655
I don't like carrots.

70
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:43,856
Damn you.

71
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,259
I ate all your bean sprouts

72
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:47,860
back in kindergarten.

73
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,363
- You liked them.
- Yeah, but I liked you more.

74
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,267
Eat up.

75
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,705
What's the date today?

76
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,342
Rotten little...!

77
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:06,946
Huh?

78
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,015
Did she just call me rotten?

79
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,364
Are you okay?
Do you feel sick?

80
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,233
- Get lost.
- Uh-huh.

81
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,968
- I'll get pooping, then.
- In-young.

82
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,271
You'd better not blab about this.

83
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:33,773
Oh.

84
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,242
We'll see.
I should go.

86
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:54,927
- Did you hear?
- What?

87
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,530
Oh In-young is freeloading
off the company.

88
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,465
What?
She's on a scholarship?

89
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:02,135
- That's crazy.
- That's what I heard.

90
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:03,803
You didn't know?

91
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,906
They pay for kids from
single-parent families.

92
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,908
In-young isn't from
a single-parent family.

93
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,643
Her mom died last year.

94
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,712
- Doesn't she have a dad?
- Never did.

95
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:15,715
Really?
Well, I know she's here for free.

96
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,251
Doesn't she know that's unfair?

97
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,053
The rest of us have to pay.

98
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,789
She's not even good enough
to major in dance.

99
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:24,323
Neither are you.

100
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,092
None of us are.

101
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,627
Na-ri's the only exception.

102
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:29,996
We won't have to see her
in a month.

103
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:33,066
Seniors are too busy with
college prep to perform.

104
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,268
It's still unfair

105
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:38,504
that she gets to
be here with us for free.

106
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,806
Isn't it, Na-ri?

107
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,376
I'm jealous of her, actually.

108
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,845
You're jealous of her? Why?

109
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:48,214
I wish my mom would
disappear too.

110
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,017
Then I won't have to listen
to her nagging.

111
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,088
Let's just go warm up.

112
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,997
Ow!

113
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,100
Oh In-young!
What's wrong with you?

114
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,602
- She tripped you on purpose?
- What?

115
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,472
I'm just a freeloader
minding my own business.

116
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:17,076
Look.

117
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:20,513
This is a serious performing
arts company.

118
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,984
Don't go bullying the girls
who actually pay to be here.

119
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,754
They shouldn't talk about
people behind their backs.

120
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,623
I guess having no money
means no manners too.

121
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,292
I tried learning through YouTube,

122
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,695
but I guess it didn't work.

123
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:46,706
Enough!
Friends shouldn't fight, right?

124
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,341
Friends?

125
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,578
Let's go.

126
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:10,997
Yes, come in.

127
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:17,770
You asked for me,
Madam Chairwoman?

128
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,974
Let's drop the formalities
when it's just us.

129
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,309
Sure, ma'am.

130
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,848
How's their show coming along?

131
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,918
I think we'll need to
extend practice hours.

132
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:36,522
It can't be easy to prepare for
a 60th anniversary show.

133
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:40,760
I can't tell you how happy
I am to have you here.

134
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:42,795
You're too kind.

135
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,264
In all my years here,

136
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:49,035
I've never seen a better,
more diligent dancer.

137
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,837
The same goes still,
as our choreographer.

138
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:54,407
Thank you for your kind words.

139
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:55,975
So I've been thinking...

140
00:12:57,577 --> 00:13:00,780
Why don't you take on

141
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:02,615
the arts director
position as well?

142
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,218
Me, ma'am?

143
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,620
You're our chief choreographer,

144
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:10,189
and I know you'll do
wonderfully.

145
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,503
Pace your breaths!
Don't rush!

146
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,780
Excuse me.

147
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,816
I'll see the sticks today.

148
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:40,286
But we haven't practiced
sticks much yet...

149
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:41,721
Right away.

150
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,244
Hwang Seung-yeon,
straighten your back and arms.

151
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,345
Ko Ji-eun,
deep breaths.

152
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,514
Kim Mi-kyung,
hold your frame pose.

153
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,217
Oh In-young,
can't you keep tempo?

154
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,620
Again.

155
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:34,407
One at a time.

156
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:52,925
In-young, smiling won't help
if you can't stick the pose.

157
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:54,560
- Yes, ma'am.
- Next.

158
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,299
Next.

159
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,638
Next.

160
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,125
Have some respect for
your role as center.

161
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:27,693
Again.

162
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,340
Again!

163
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,589
We'll do sticks instead of
the six drums.

164
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,924
A repertoire of sticks and
sogo drums will do.

165
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,627
But it's so sudden...

166
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:04,096
Any lacking routines will be

167
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,432
pulled from the show.

168
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:07,466
What?

169
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,236
But we've been working
so hard for months...

170
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,437
Diligence doesn't excuse

171
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,439
the lack of skill or talent.

172
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:16,308
The Chairwoman always
selects the program...

173
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,177
I've discussed it with her.

174
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:19,645
You'll run things by me now.

175
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,216
I'll review the repertoire again
when you're ready.

176
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,644
What if we miss her again
this week?

177
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,213
I don't know what to do...

178
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,081
(Social Services)

179
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,050
We can wait some more.

180
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:43,162
- Let's call it a night.
- All right.

181
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,783
Sheesh.

182
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:07,419
Makes me take out the
trash this late...

183
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,388
She could've done it earlier.

184
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:11,223
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

185
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,725
Thank you. Come again.

186
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,060
(Pharmacy)

187
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:20,199
- There you are.
- Evidently.

188
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,301
What brings you here today?

189
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,603
Do you have anything for stress?

190
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,473
Of course, kiddo.
We've got it all.

191
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,410
- What's this?
- Presto.

192
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:32,745
(VITA-C)

193
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:34,079
Isn't this for kids?

194
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,414
Precisely.

195
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:36,415
Huh?

196
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:38,384
Works like a charm.

197
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,418
Turns frowns upside-down.

198
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,454
Don't knock it
till you've tried it.

199
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,323
Why do I bother...

200
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:47,726
How much?

201
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,229
For a VIP customer like you...

202
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:51,130
500 won.

203
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:53,599
- What's the mark-up?
- Trade secret.

204
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,100
500 won, I'd bet.

205
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:57,636
You can't buy them by
the piece, though.

206
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,271
It's a special promotion.

207
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:01,207
Can I have my tab, please?

208
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,380
November 23rd.
500 won.

209
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,482
Yeah, yeah.

210
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,751
Okay.

211
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:16,389
Something on your mind?

212
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,058
Do you have anything like this?

213
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,294
Something that'll make me sleep

214
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:23,996
and wake up 20 years later.

215
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,231
Of course we do,
but it's expensive.

216
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:27,399
How much is it?

217
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:28,801
Trade secret.

218
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:31,203
That's your answer to everything.

219
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,939
I'll take another one of these.

220
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,709
Then how about two for
the price of one?

221
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:39,278
- Deal of the day.
- You're just making it up now.

222
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,679
I should sell the pills to
pay the bills.

223
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:43,215
You and your corny jokes.

224
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,817
- 500 won.
- Put it on the tab.

225
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:47,186
- Don't go. I'm bored.
- Not my problem.

226
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:48,921
I can't play "bored" games
by myself.

227
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:52,024
You'll laugh at that one
when you get home!

228
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:50,282
Excuse me!

229
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,017
In-young?

230
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,355
He's still awake...

231
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,729
I don't want to do this,

232
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:06,465
but we rely on the
rent income.

233
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,102
You're still so young...

234
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,972
You should go live with
your relatives instead.

235
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,442
I need the unit vacant
by next week.

236
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,016
(Buyer: "Do you take offers?")

237
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,160
(New offer on wood lamp)

238
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:09,528
Wait, but...

239
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,333
Okay, take it.

240
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,169
Okay.

241
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:32,918
I'll only charge 600 won
since it's expired.

242
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:21,901
(Self Laundry)

243
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,211
There you go! Okay!

244
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,247
That's all for today.
Great job.

245
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:10,149
Thank you.

246
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:31,570
Are you dating Park Do-yoon?

247
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:33,538
Why would I date my friend?

248
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:36,208
Then can she date him?

249
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:37,776
You like Do-yoon?

250
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:39,745
I'm considering it.

251
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:42,981
- I thought you liked him.
- Why?

252
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:46,285
- You always eat together.
- That means we're dating?

253
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:48,387
Maybe not, but it means
there's something.

254
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,291
Ji-eun. Seung-yeon.

255
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:53,492
You're staying late today?

256
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:59,564
Na-ri, can we join your private
lesson this weekend?

257
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,300
Maybe...

258
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:03,268
I'll have to ask the teacher.

259
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,504
We'll stay out of your way.

260
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:07,539
Fine.

261
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,009
- Thank you!
- Bye. Have fun!

262
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:11,877
Ow, that hurts.

263
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:13,378
Do you want snacks later?

264
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:14,747
How about tteokbokki?

265
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:31,863
Doesn't Na-ri
look like those dolls?

266
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:32,998
Which ones?

267
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:37,669
The ones in music boxes that
can twirl for hours.

268
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:40,105
Yeah, she doesn't seem
human sometimes.

269
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:42,741
What's happening?

270
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:47,846
Surprise!
We just came to hang.

271
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:49,982
- Come on!
- Why'd you turn off the lights?

272
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:53,151
- My mom's at some dinner.
- Mine went to the sauna.

273
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,920
Did you guys hear that story?

274
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:55,988
What story?

275
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,624
About the ghost that haunts
our arts building...

276
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,225
A ghost?

277
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:01,827
Years ago, there was a girl

278
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:04,396
who
danced as well as Na-ri...

279
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:14,272
She was always the best,

280
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,108
which made the 2nd best jealous.

281
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:19,244
Hey, why do I have to be
the 2nd best dancer?

282
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:22,080
- Don't break the flow.
- Anyway...

283
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:24,516
The number 2 dancer was
so consumed with envy...

284
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,019
She devised an evil plan to

285
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:29,287
keep the other girl from dancing.

286
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:30,889
Necromancy.

287
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:33,692
Chop!

288
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:38,931
The number 1 dancer ends up
losing a foot in an accident.

289
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,567
Unable to dance ever again,

290
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,269
the dancer took her own life.

291
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:48,240
That's when her ghost began
appearing

292
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:50,542
in this very building.

293
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,110
Searching for a foot that fits

294
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:53,312
so she can dance again!

295
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:57,850
Don't take my feet!
I'm not even that good!

296
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,120
I told you she'd fall for it!

297
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,358
Huh?

298
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,862
- You all played a joke on me?
- Yup.

299
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:13,231
- You fell for it too, right?
- I couldn't help it.

300
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,633
That was good.

301
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:20,706
Wait...

302
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,608
I think I see the ghost...

303
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,285
Gosh, I almost got caught.

304
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:36,321
Why are they still here?
I'm starving!

305
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,865
- Mr. Park!
- Hello, ma'am.

306
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:48,667
Good evening.

307
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,369
I'm sorry for bothering you.

308
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:54,139
- And thank you, as always.
- No, thank you.

309
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:05,484
We'll be on our way, ma'am.

310
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:06,351
Sure.

311
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,355
Good night.

312
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:37,783
What are you doing here?

313
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,955
Would...

314
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:45,290
Would you like a bite?

315
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:50,028
What's going on?

316
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,830
Well...

317
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:54,900
I hadn't had dinner yet...

318
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:56,101
Not that.

319
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:57,936
Why are you sleeping here?

320
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,504
Oh...

321
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,106
Because I have nowhere
else to go.

322
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:04,476
- What happened to your home?
- I got kicked out.

323
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:05,811
What about relatives?

324
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,818
That doesn't mean you can
sneak around living here.

325
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:16,354
I'm sorry.

326
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,290
How long has it been?

327
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,128
- A week.
- A whole week!

328
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,501
And without getting caught.

329
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:31,103
It was pretty damn--

330
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:33,905
Pretty hard.

331
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:35,374
Wait here.

332
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:51,756
(Name: Oh In-young)

333
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,960
(Mother - Lee Yeon-hwa
deceased)

334
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:11,576
She can't be...

335
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:30,362
Grab your bags.

336
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:48,046
Ms. Hwang!

337
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:52,017
Yes?

338
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:53,985
It's just...

339
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:56,421
I have a few more things...

340
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:26,618
That's it for this room.

341
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:50,609
Isn't that company property?

342
00:31:51,777 --> 00:31:53,011
It's mine.

343
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,080
Perfect place to hide it,
don't you think?

344
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:20,505
Ms. Hwang, where are we going?

345
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:23,975
It's getting late.
You can stay at a hotel.

346
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,412
Minors aren't allowed.

347
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,449
Then go to a sauna.

348
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,817
They'll kick me out after 10.

349
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:35,287
Same goes for internet and
comic book cafes.

350
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,126
Don't you have any friends
you can sleep over with?

351
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:45,197
I have one, but he's a boy.
Is that okay?

352
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:53,738
Believe me, there's nowhere
better than the studio.

353
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,673
I can get a bit fussy

354
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,909
about
my sleeping conditions.

355
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,677
Hard water makes me break out,

356
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:03,481
and even the click of a
light switch wakes me up.

357
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:06,584
I'm really fine sleeping
at the studio now.

358
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:10,288
I don't want to bother anyone,
so let's head back.

359
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:11,990
U-turn, U-turn!

360
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:13,358
Shut it!

361
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,838
Just for 2 to 3 days while
I figure this out.

362
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:28,440
The two of us for that long?

363
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:39,951
Why is the passcode so long?

364
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:42,888
If you can't remember,
you'll be locked out.

365
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:03,308
Woah!

366
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,483
Where's my room?

367
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:13,885
Follow me.

368
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,666
Oh, wow.

369
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,079
Wow!

370
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:42,447
You must be rich!

371
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:44,316
You have your own studio!

372
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,618
It'll be easier for both of us

373
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:48,219
if you stay down here.

374
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:50,455
This will be better than
the locker room.

375
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:53,458
Oh, this is just perfect.

376
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:55,560
A few rules.

377
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:58,530
First, stay only in the
spaces that I've allowed.

378
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:01,533
Second, don't do anything
while you're staying here.

379
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,836
- I was wondering...
- Lastly, no questions.

380
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:08,707
Do you wipe these mirrors
all by yourself?

381
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,075
Gosh, they're spotless.

382
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,844
How do you do it every day?

383
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:15,747
How do you talk so much?

384
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:17,148
Oh, that?

385
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:19,050
That's what my mom
used to say too,

386
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,920
that I'd sink mouth-first
if I fell into the water.

387
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:23,788
To chat with the fish.

388
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:31,663
Ms. Hwang?

389
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:34,933
What now?

390
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,234
Where's the bathroom?

391
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:48,146
What a clean freak.

392
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:01,593
What is this, a pharmacy?

393
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:50,542
Okay.

394
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:20,138
Feels just like home. Empty.

395
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,313
What are you doing?

396
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:31,616
Just getting some water.

397
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,023
Shouldn't you be at school?

398
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,258
It's Saturday.

399
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,162
Don't you eat any real food?

400
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,636
What is it?

401
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,118
Why would anyone drink that?

402
00:38:08,186 --> 00:38:09,654
Jeez.

403
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:14,092
Didn't anyone tell you that
carbs are the key to happiness?

404
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:17,061
You don't even eat, which is
why they call you a wit--

405
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,696
A witch?

406
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:22,567
You knew?

407
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:24,936
Can you wipe that before
it stains?

408
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:26,104
Sure!

409
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:40,318
What are you doing?

410
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:42,220
- It's almost time.
- Time for?

411
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:44,355
For the meatlover's box
to expire...

412
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:49,694
60, 59, 58...

413
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,163
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

414
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:01,072
(Meatlover's Lunch Box)

415
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:12,550
This expires in 50 seconds,
you know...

416
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:14,185
I'm fine with that.

417
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:16,588
Okay.

418
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,698
- Would you like a receipt?
- No thanks.

419
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:29,734
Thank you.

420
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:36,941
Damn it.

421
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:42,080
(Shrimp Lunch Box)

422
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:43,981
What's this?

423
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,583
My treat.

424
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,886
The most expensive one, too.

425
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:50,622
Hell yeah!

426
00:39:57,195 --> 00:39:58,897
- Oh, hi!
- Hello!

427
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,608
Why are there so many
lunch boxes today?

428
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:12,343
That's the order you put in.

429
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,645
See for yourself.

430
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,251
Park Do-yoon!

431
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:22,820
You put an extra zero
on the order, didn't you!

432
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:24,422
Nope, it wasn't me.

433
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:25,790
I've never put in orders.

434
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,659
What do we do now?

435
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:31,996
I'd help you if I could,
but I'm broke now.

436
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:39,103
- Let's split it.
- Okay.

437
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:40,638
Sure!

438
00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:42,774
We'll split it.
Good!

439
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:52,984
What's this?

440
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:55,620
It's yours if you agree to
take it out of my tab.

441
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:57,989
I'm allergic to shrimp.

442
00:40:58,056 --> 00:41:00,625
Take some pills, then.
Look around you.

443
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:02,760
No, I can't eat shrimp.
Let me switch.

444
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:04,829
Picky customer.

445
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:06,831
Fine, but just this once!

446
00:41:06,898 --> 00:41:08,066
Nice.

447
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,635
Grilled eel? That's too fatty.

448
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:12,904
Just take what I give you!

449
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,805
You're scaring me, kid.

450
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:16,407
What's all this?

451
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,276
Did you hijack
a delivery truck?

452
00:41:18,343 --> 00:41:21,245
There was a problem
and I'm fixing it.

453
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:24,749
I can't remember if it's
my fault or his...

454
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:26,951
Is this the guy that I know?

455
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:28,319
Yup.

456
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:31,456
You've got a little thing with
Do-yoon, don't you?

457
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,592
What are you talking about?

458
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,961
You're not denying it.
I knew it.

459
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:39,697
Where's Do-yoon?
I need to have a talk with him.

460
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:42,033
He's out selling his share
somewhere.

461
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,335
Where have you been
these days?

462
00:41:44,402 --> 00:41:46,571
Are you buying from
some other pharmacy?

463
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:49,741
Something came up.
I'm staying elsewhere.

464
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:52,343
- Where?
- Just somewhere.

465
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:55,046
- The witch's castle.
- What's that?

466
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:57,982
There's a certain crabby, frigid,

467
00:41:58,049 --> 00:42:00,251
and heartless witch...

468
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:09,260
She never married and
lives alone in an old castle.

469
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:36,220
She endures her loneliness

470
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:37,555
by tormenting the sweet princess.

471
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:40,124
Wait a minute, please.

472
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:43,160
And you're this sweet princess?

473
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,929
Is that a problem?

474
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:46,964
Not my kind of main character.

475
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,068
- I can't focus.
- Whatever.

476
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,737
How much is left on
my tab now?

477
00:42:52,804 --> 00:42:54,672
I got paid today.

478
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:56,707
Yeah? It's 157,500 won.

479
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:58,176
I'll take off the 500.

480
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:02,680
Then...

481
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:05,416
I'll pay you next month.

482
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:07,518
Stop by if you need antacids

483
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,120
for those lunch boxes!

484
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:11,155
Yes?

485
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:15,526
Gosh, Seol-ah?

486
00:43:16,861 --> 00:43:18,096
I can come back later.

487
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:20,498
Don't mind me.
I have to get going.

488
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:22,199
Hey.

489
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,235
Why aren't you wearing
the scarf I got you?

490
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:26,137
I picked a great color for you.

491
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:28,773
I didn't feel comfortable
taking one.

492
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:32,376
Still as fussy as always.

493
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,478
I'll stop by again.

494
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:36,013
Don't work yourself too hard.

495
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:37,648
All right.

496
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:40,384
It's nice seeing my old
students together again.

497
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,528
You'll be at her thank-you
party meeting later?

498
00:43:50,595 --> 00:43:52,296
Sure.

499
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:53,264
See you then.

500
00:43:54,065 --> 00:43:56,234
- Lovely seeing you, ma'am.
- You too.

501
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:58,002
Come by again.

502
00:44:04,175 --> 00:44:05,910
Is the show coming along?

503
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:08,179
Yes.

504
00:44:08,246 --> 00:44:10,247
I'll make sure everything
runs smoothly.

505
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:13,985
Still quite the perfectionist,
Ms. Hwang.

506
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:42,280
That's enough for today.

507
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:49,687
The girls seem a bit more
nervous today.

508
00:44:49,754 --> 00:44:52,923
We'll extend practice hours
over winter break.

509
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,258
Yes, ma'am.

510
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:57,728
I have an important
announcement.

511
00:44:58,229 --> 00:44:59,997
To ensure optimal performance,

512
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:02,433
individual auditions will be
held next week.

513
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:06,270
Those who fail to qualify
will not be on stage.

514
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:09,073
Make sure to come prepared.

515
00:45:27,258 --> 00:45:29,026
You had to drop the knife...

516
00:45:29,994 --> 00:45:32,763
We're out of the show if we
fail the audition?

517
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:35,399
- That's what she said.
- What do we do?

518
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:38,803
If we can't even dance
for our last show...

519
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:41,472
Don't waste time worrying
and just practice.

520
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:57,888
Director Hwang.
Why the sudden auditions?

521
00:45:57,955 --> 00:46:01,158
Individual skill is crucial to
a group performance.

522
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:03,494
But won't the failed girls
feel discouraged?

523
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:07,731
Is that mindset really in
their best interests?

524
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:10,468
I won't put anyone on stage
who isn't fully prepared.

525
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:13,204
But, ma'am...

526
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:14,405
Hello?

527
00:46:14,472 --> 00:46:16,040
Ms. Hwang Seol-ah?

528
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:19,877
This is Kangseo District's
Child and Youth Welfare.

529
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:20,811
Yes?

530
00:46:20,878 --> 00:46:23,047
Since the minor you asked

531
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:25,082
about
has no legal guardian,

532
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:27,318
she's obligated to enter
foster care.

533
00:46:27,385 --> 00:46:30,588
We've been struggling to
reach her for some time.

534
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,482
Why aren't you heading home?

535
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:00,751
Well...

536
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,386
I thought I'd go with you.

537
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:05,523
Get in.

538
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:18,035
What?

539
00:47:18,102 --> 00:47:19,737
Oh, nothing.

540
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:22,706
I'll take you to the station.

541
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:24,141
Why?

542
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:26,210
I have plans.
You go on home.

543
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:27,511
Oh...

544
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:30,414
- The passcode--
- I remember.

545
00:47:30,481 --> 00:47:32,583
198012121004.

546
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,754
You said I'd be locked out
if I couldn't remember.

547
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,564
Drive safely and don't
stay out too late.

548
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:10,154
Why don't we do it on the
evening after the show?

549
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:11,155
Sounds good.

550
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:13,557
I'll prepare the invitations

551
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:15,859
and
take care of the costs.

552
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:20,030
It's the least I can do for
my Na-ri's company, right?

553
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:22,232
Wouldn't expect less from
our generous leader.

554
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:24,268
The Chairwoman will be
so touched.

555
00:48:24,335 --> 00:48:26,704
That settles everything, right?

556
00:48:26,771 --> 00:48:28,539
- Sure does.
- Sounds great.

557
00:48:28,606 --> 00:48:29,239
Hye-jeong.

558
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:31,909
I heard your daughter won
the competition again.

559
00:48:31,976 --> 00:48:34,778
- It's no big deal.
- I'm jealous.

560
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:36,814
Must be nice to have a kid
you don't have to nag.

561
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:39,783
I hear she's just like Seol-ah
in her younger days.

562
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:43,420
Such a hard worker and always
taking center stage.

563
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:47,992
If she's half as good as Seol-ah,
what more could I want?

564
00:48:50,995 --> 00:48:52,363
This is so tasty.

565
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:57,768
Do you really want your kid
to be like Seol-ah?

566
00:48:57,835 --> 00:48:59,236
What do you mean?

567
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:01,205
Honestly, I never envied a thing

568
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:02,940
about her besides her talent.

569
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:07,278
I knew too well the efforts she
made to stay at the top.

570
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:09,646
What's wrong with that?

571
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:13,484
Have you ever seen Seol-ah
genuinely smiling on stage?

572
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:16,720
Yeon-hwa was the one who
always looked happy.

573
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,322
She wasn't as good as Seol-ah,

574
00:49:18,389 --> 00:49:20,924
but she truly loved to dance.

575
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:24,061
- Who's Yeon-hwa?
- You remember.

576
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:25,462
The girl that had to quit

577
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:27,564
because she couldn't afford it.

578
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:30,434
- The one who died last year?
- She did?

579
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:32,870
I have to head back to
the office.

580
00:49:32,937 --> 00:49:35,639
Well, we know how
busy you are.

581
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:36,907
Go ahead.

582
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,742
That's a shame.

583
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,577
Isn't it Hye-jeong's
birthday soon?

584
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,613
- That's right!
- Tell us what you want.

585
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:45,282
Oh, I'm fine.

586
00:50:13,911 --> 00:50:15,479
- What are you doing?
- Oh!

587
00:50:15,546 --> 00:50:16,780
Making dinner.

588
00:50:24,922 --> 00:50:26,256
Who told you to do this?

589
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:29,293
Just try a bite or two,
Ms. Hwang.

590
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,594
Come on!

591
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:32,897
I told you not to do anything.

592
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:38,736
I'm sorry.

593
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:41,205
It's your birthday, so...

594
00:50:41,939 --> 00:50:44,642
I just wanted to make you dinner.

595
00:51:04,328 --> 00:51:05,262
How is it?

596
00:51:06,764 --> 00:51:07,564
Not bad.

597
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:09,233
Right?

598
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:12,369
The one thing I can make
is a good birthday soup.

599
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:13,737
I always made it for
Mom's birthday.

600
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,341
How did you know my birthday?

601
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:19,543
From your messenger profile.

602
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:28,852
Come on, try some of these.

603
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,320
It's great with rice.

604
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:32,322
It's no birthday without
some rice.

605
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:34,725
A full belly helps you feel alive.

606
00:51:34,792 --> 00:51:37,828
A life of green juice and pills
is hardly living.

607
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,104
Ms. Hwang!

608
00:51:47,638 --> 00:51:50,174
How about a blind date?

609
00:51:51,175 --> 00:51:53,110
- A blind date?
- That's right.

610
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:56,747
I know a handsome and
business-savvy pharmacist.

611
00:51:57,481 --> 00:51:59,083
Never mind and eat.

612
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:02,086
Just think about it.

613
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:10,160
Come on, eat up!

614
00:52:10,227 --> 00:52:12,062
Eating healthy starts with
eating hearty.

615
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,630
Stop nagging me.

616
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:18,135
I'm just voicing my concern
for your well-being.

617
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:19,703
Go downstairs if you're done.

618
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:22,406
No, I'll sit with you.

619
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:24,008
It's your birthday.

620
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,543
You never just go along,
do you?

621
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:28,445
Fine.

622
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:31,181
Call me when you're done.
I'll do the dishes.

623
00:52:39,857 --> 00:52:42,192
Take your time, okay?
Chew a lot.

624
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:44,395
Dunking rice in the soup
and slurping helps.

625
00:52:45,763 --> 00:52:47,031
Slurp!

626
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,361
What's all that?

627
00:53:17,428 --> 00:53:19,596
Today's supposed to be
my last day here.

628
00:53:20,898 --> 00:53:23,433
Since the minor has no
legal guardian,

629
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,636
she's obligated to enter
foster care.

630
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,308
- Leave the bags for now.
- Huh?

631
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:33,944
I'm still looking into it,
so leave the bags.

632
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:03,107
Are you sick?

633
00:54:05,676 --> 00:54:06,844
Headache.

634
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:11,381
Do you want to try one?

635
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:12,716
It works like a charm.

636
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:18,856
Turns frowns upside-down
every time.

637
00:54:20,124 --> 00:54:21,625
Just leave it there.

638
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:30,601
What is it?

639
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:34,505
Can't we listen to some
fun music for a bit?

640
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:36,273
What music?

641
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:52,623
Such unique taste...

642
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:07,404
Pull yourselves together.

643
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:09,239
Your performance could be

644
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,441
the one show of
a person's lifetime.

645
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:12,442
Again.

646
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:22,820
Ko Ji-eun.

647
00:55:23,587 --> 00:55:25,155
Switch with Oh In-young.

648
00:55:25,756 --> 00:55:26,490
Ma'am?

649
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:36,166
Again.

650
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:50,914
Good work.

651
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:53,150
That's all for today.

652
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:56,553
Thank you, ma'am.

653
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:51,074
- Hello.
- Yeah.

654
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:05,121
Why do they hate me for
being poor

655
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:06,957
and parentless?

656
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:11,528
Wait, who hates you?

657
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:14,598
Just...

658
00:57:14,665 --> 00:57:15,999
Some kids.

659
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:28,879
You think that's why
they dislike you?

660
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:30,814
Why else?

661
00:57:31,348 --> 00:57:33,150
People can be strange.

662
00:57:33,717 --> 00:57:36,319
They get jealous of you for
never gaining weight...

663
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:39,623
Or if you look happy even
when you're helpless.

664
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,193
I don't understand why,
but they do.

665
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:46,563
Dong-wook.

666
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,166
- What can I take for this?
- For what?

667
00:57:50,367 --> 00:57:54,905
For erasing my memory
after a really bad day.

668
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:56,373
Of course.

669
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:01,712
It can cause dizziness
at times,

670
00:58:02,379 --> 00:58:05,949
but it'll reset your memory
to the beginning.

671
00:58:06,016 --> 00:58:07,384
Comes in a green bottle.

672
00:58:08,685 --> 00:58:12,489
A few gulps and you'll forget
all your worries,

673
00:58:12,556 --> 00:58:14,858
but they don't sell it
to minors.

674
00:58:17,094 --> 00:58:19,763
Life is so unfair for kids.

675
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:20,897
How so?

676
00:58:22,265 --> 00:58:24,034
We're just as stressed as adults,

677
00:58:24,101 --> 00:58:26,236
but we have to take it.

678
00:58:30,407 --> 00:58:34,111
It's not as effective as the
green bottle stuff,

679
00:58:35,045 --> 00:58:37,114
but I might have something
that'll work.

680
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,483
I'm sick of vitamins.

681
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:41,985
It's not that.

682
00:58:44,054 --> 00:58:47,090
I've never seen a kid

683
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:50,060
who didn't smile at this.

684
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:51,695
I have one too sometimes.

685
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,438
No good?

686
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:16,420
Why would you give me this
on a day like this?

687
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:20,590
Whenever I got sick...

688
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:24,661
My mom would give me
a lollipop like this.

689
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:33,503
You can't go around acting like
you know everything!

690
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:37,207
Now I can't stop thinking of her,

691
00:59:37,274 --> 00:59:39,609
because of your stupid candy...

692
00:59:42,012 --> 00:59:43,480
All I did was get angry at her.

693
00:59:44,648 --> 00:59:46,950
Even that last day, too.

694
00:59:47,017 --> 00:59:49,019
Never got to say sorry.

695
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,924
Why did you have to...

696
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:57,694
Why would you give this
to me now?

697
01:00:31,161 --> 01:00:33,930
(Incoming call
Oh In-young)

698
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:37,767
Do you know how late--

699
01:00:41,338 --> 01:00:42,572
Pardon?

700
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:01,458
- Welcome.
- Excuse me.

701
01:01:01,525 --> 01:01:03,160
I'm here for In-young...

702
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:04,995
The witch!

703
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:07,130
Pardon?

704
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:09,366
In-young's over there.

705
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:25,649
Would you like one?

706
01:01:26,283 --> 01:01:27,551
Thank you.

707
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:29,853
And one of these?

708
01:01:36,092 --> 01:01:38,094
She cried a lot earlier.

709
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:41,898
She must've been struggling.

710
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:49,206
They say parting is quick
for those who leave,

711
01:01:49,773 --> 01:01:51,808
but it never ends

712
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,210
for the
ones left behind.

713
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:57,881
Looks like she's still saying
goodbye to her mom.

714
01:02:08,792 --> 01:02:10,961
Holding it in wouldn't
do her any good.

715
01:02:12,963 --> 01:02:15,064
Better to cry it out at
a pharmacy, I guess.

716
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:18,835
I'm glad she has someone
to depend on.

717
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:24,073
I couldn't do anything for her.

718
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:26,409
She's not one to show it,

719
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:28,612
but I'm sure she's very grateful.

720
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:31,915
You gave her a place to sleep.
Food to eat.

721
01:02:41,658 --> 01:02:43,626
When did you get here?

722
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:45,195
Did she make you cry?

723
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:46,429
Are you here for meds?

724
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:48,498
Mom had too many lunch boxes.

725
01:02:53,303 --> 01:02:54,437
You're really not eating?

726
01:02:54,504 --> 01:02:57,440
Isn't this your favorite?
Just eat up.

727
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:08,585
Why do you dance, In-young?

728
01:03:08,652 --> 01:03:10,453
Because it made Mom happy.

729
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:13,022
She had to quit because she
couldn't afford it.

730
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:15,592
You know that, right?
She said you were friends.

731
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,294
Yes.

732
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:21,965
I think that's why she wanted
me to keep dancing.

733
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:23,533
But you don't like it?

734
01:03:24,067 --> 01:03:26,002
Oh, I like dancing.

735
01:03:26,069 --> 01:03:27,971
But it doesn't matter now
since I'm quitting.

736
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:31,207
I'm not going to major in
dance like the others.

737
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:34,010
I just want to become
a grown-up soon.

738
01:03:34,511 --> 01:03:35,245
Why is that?

739
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:37,280
Because I'll be able to do
whatever I want,

740
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,317
and no one will tell me
that I shouldn't.

741
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:43,419
It's no different for adults.

742
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:45,855
We can't do much of anything

743
01:03:45,922 --> 01:03:48,024
the way we'd like either.

744
01:03:49,059 --> 01:03:50,126
That's a shame.

745
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:52,795
But...

746
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:55,898
You're already capable of making
your own choices.

747
01:03:55,965 --> 01:04:00,003
You just don't know what
you want yet.

748
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:03,340
If you like to dance,
give it your all.

749
01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:05,809
Keep trying until you have
no regrets,

750
01:04:06,376 --> 01:04:07,543
and if that doesn't work...

751
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:08,812
Then you can quit.

752
01:04:09,913 --> 01:04:13,850
Will I be better if I try?

753
01:04:15,552 --> 01:04:16,920
Maybe.

754
01:04:17,554 --> 01:04:19,422
But you'll be better than
if you didn't try at all.

755
01:04:22,592 --> 01:04:24,728
Why do you work so hard
at everything?

756
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:28,231
Because it makes my mom happy.

757
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:31,301
My mom said you were
really impressive.

758
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:34,137
I think you still are.

759
01:04:37,307 --> 01:04:38,341
Thanks.

760
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:44,948
Ready to go?

761
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:03,700
Don't get lazy over break.

762
01:05:03,767 --> 01:05:06,536
You'll be back as seniors,
so get ready.

763
01:05:06,603 --> 01:05:07,670
Yes, sir!

764
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,572
Can't wait, huh?

765
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:12,175
- Don't get into trouble!
- Yes, sir!

766
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:13,576
Okay. Class president?

767
01:05:14,944 --> 01:05:16,713
- Class dismissed!
- Thank you!

768
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:17,781
(Have a happy and safe
winter break)

769
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:36,933
What's going on?

770
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,970
- They'll come back a couple.
- In-young is so lucky.

771
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:03,259
We might try the pants--

772
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:04,861
And this group--

773
01:06:04,928 --> 01:06:06,863
Let's get this confirmed.

774
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:46,369
Yes!

775
01:08:01,177 --> 01:08:02,245
I guess...

776
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:04,180
It's not bad.

777
01:08:51,027 --> 01:08:52,528
(Lee Yeon-hwa)

778
01:09:02,739 --> 01:09:04,374
I'll do my best.

779
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:46,282
Next. Oh In-young.

780
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:47,250
Yes.

781
01:10:12,075 --> 01:10:13,242
That'll do.

782
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:14,944
Big improvement, In-young.

783
01:10:16,446 --> 01:10:17,647
Thank you!

784
01:10:18,915 --> 01:10:20,917
Next. Choi Na-ri.

785
01:10:41,304 --> 01:10:43,606
Na-ri, what's the matter?

786
01:10:43,673 --> 01:10:45,408
Shake off the nerves.

787
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:58,755
Enough.

788
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:01,590
- I'll start over.
- No.

789
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:04,260
- Ms. Hwang!
- Everyone gets one chance.

790
01:11:04,861 --> 01:11:06,763
Would you start over
if this happened on stage?

791
01:11:07,864 --> 01:11:09,965
That one chance is why
skill is crucial.

792
01:11:10,032 --> 01:11:13,002
The audience knows when
a dancer is distracted.

793
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:17,306
That's a lesson I hope you learn.

794
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,008
You're done.

795
01:11:19,509 --> 01:11:20,877
Next. Ko Ji-eun.

796
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:24,580
- Let's invite In-young.
- Sure.

797
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:27,616
She might have work,
but let's ask.

798
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:29,318
In-young, what are you
up to today?

799
01:11:29,385 --> 01:11:31,520
- Do you have to work?
- No. Why?

800
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:33,356
Come eat tteokbokki with us.

801
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:35,658
I thought you two didn't like me.

802
01:11:35,725 --> 01:11:38,561
Of course not, we're all friends.

803
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:40,329
You're such flip-floppers.

804
01:11:40,396 --> 01:11:41,897
Water under the bridge.

805
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:44,133
- Come with us. My treat.
- Let's go.

806
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,935
Isn't Na-ri going?

807
01:11:46,002 --> 01:11:48,004
No, she doesn't eat snacks.

808
01:11:50,673 --> 01:11:51,874
Hey, Ji-eun! Seung-yeon!

809
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:53,609
What's with you two?

810
01:11:54,177 --> 01:11:56,312
What? You don't like tteokbokki.

811
01:11:56,379 --> 01:11:57,980
Since when?

812
01:11:58,047 --> 01:11:59,915
I love tteokbokki.
You know I love to eat.

813
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:01,284
But you'll throw up after.

814
01:12:02,552 --> 01:12:06,389
We know you throw up to
pretend you're naturally thin.

815
01:12:08,257 --> 01:12:09,025
You told them.

816
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:14,230
You act all nice while
backstabbing people.

817
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:16,732
Whatever you say.

818
01:12:17,733 --> 01:12:20,336
Why is everything a joke to you?

819
01:12:20,403 --> 01:12:21,904
Why is everything
such a big deal to you?

820
01:12:21,971 --> 01:12:24,607
Because you're freeloading
off the rest of us.

821
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:27,443
- Where's your self-respect?
- Don't have any.

822
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:29,945
But what's your excuse for
being so bitter?

823
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:31,981
I'm not bitter, you prick.

824
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:34,717
I get that you don't like me.

825
01:12:34,784 --> 01:12:37,753
I'm a poor freeloader and
that pisses you off.

826
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:40,256
But why do you even care?

827
01:12:41,424 --> 01:12:44,193
Just being in the same place
as you bothers me.

828
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:45,895
Not because you messed up?

829
01:12:47,263 --> 01:12:48,531
Yeah, Na-ri.

830
01:12:48,598 --> 01:12:51,334
Are you scared In-young
might take your spot?

831
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:54,003
What did you say?

832
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:57,673
You two hardly exist in this
company, so watch it!

833
01:12:57,740 --> 01:13:00,509
That's rich when you're only
here thanks to your mom.

834
01:13:00,576 --> 01:13:02,011
You used to kiss up to me for it,

835
01:13:02,078 --> 01:13:02,845
and now you switched!

836
01:13:02,912 --> 01:13:05,714
Get over yourself, Na-ri.
You're a wreck.

837
01:13:05,781 --> 01:13:06,782
What?

838
01:13:07,783 --> 01:13:10,820
You're the ones who can't
dance at all.

839
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:15,458
It's no use trying to talk to
a snob like you.

840
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:17,593
I feel sorry for you.

841
01:13:19,462 --> 01:13:20,496
Ow!

842
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:21,697
You feel sorry for me?

843
01:13:24,467 --> 01:13:26,936
Yeah, because your excuses
are so childish.

844
01:13:27,003 --> 01:13:28,204
You can't even be honest

845
01:13:28,271 --> 01:13:30,005
and say you don't like me!

846
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:31,273
What would you know?

847
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:33,175
You don't know anything,
you're clueless!

848
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,144
At least I know what
I want to say.

849
01:13:35,211 --> 01:13:37,246
You have no right to
say that to me!

850
01:13:37,313 --> 01:13:38,414
Ow!

851
01:13:38,481 --> 01:13:40,482
You wench!

852
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:43,085
- Na-ri!
- Let go!

853
01:13:43,152 --> 01:13:44,386
Get off me!

854
01:13:44,453 --> 01:13:46,188
Let go of me!

855
01:13:51,294 --> 01:13:52,895
Just stop it!

856
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:22,992
Since we were done with
auditions today...

857
01:14:23,059 --> 01:14:27,563
I was going to grab a snack
with Ji-eun and In-young.

858
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:29,732
Na-ri messed up
her audition

859
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:31,901
and was upset all day...

860
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:35,404
We couldn't approach her
or ask her to come.

861
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:36,839
I just...

862
01:14:39,008 --> 01:14:40,710
I thought they excluded me

863
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:43,245
because I messed up...

864
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:44,847
We weren't leaving her out.

865
01:14:45,348 --> 01:14:47,783
Everyone just wants to do well.

866
01:14:49,585 --> 01:14:52,755
I got my first compliment today...

867
01:14:53,255 --> 01:14:56,392
Everyone seemed on edge recently.

868
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:00,663
We're all scared to be left
out of the show.

869
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:04,366
Maybe it's because we're all
worried and nervous.

870
01:15:04,433 --> 01:15:06,602
It must be hard being
center stage.

871
01:15:07,103 --> 01:15:10,006
You always have to be good.
Never be bad.

872
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:13,776
It must be a heavy burden.

873
01:15:15,077 --> 01:15:16,645
I really wanted to do well...

874
01:15:18,381 --> 01:15:19,548
I'm so sorry.

875
01:15:24,286 --> 01:15:25,688
I apologize, ma'am.

876
01:15:25,755 --> 01:15:28,591
All the girls said they
wanted to do well.

877
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:33,562
Does the problem lie in
our desires?

878
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:37,533
Or in our ways?

879
01:17:58,174 --> 01:17:59,808
Don't you worry.

880
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:01,543
I'll take care of it.

881
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:04,213
They can't pull you from the show

882
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:05,447
because of a girl like that.

883
01:18:06,549 --> 01:18:10,452
What could they possibly
achieve without you?

884
01:18:10,953 --> 01:18:12,955
- It was my fault.
- What?

885
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:15,991
It's all my fault.

886
01:18:16,058 --> 01:18:18,127
How is it your fault?

887
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:19,128
No.

888
01:18:19,195 --> 01:18:22,164
Even if you had done
something wrong,

889
01:18:22,231 --> 01:18:23,832
a worthless girl like that

890
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:25,868
has no place in the company.

891
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:29,205
What's so great about it?

892
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:31,306
Is it that big a deal?

893
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:32,808
What's gotten into you?

894
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:36,345
I hate living in a world
you made for me.

895
01:18:36,412 --> 01:18:37,713
Na-ri!

896
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:39,582
I want to lead my own life.

897
01:18:40,449 --> 01:18:42,384
I worked hard to make you happy,

898
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:45,087
but I don't know anymore.

899
01:18:47,423 --> 01:18:50,359
You think you could've come
this far on your own?

900
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:55,231
You became the best because
I supported you.

901
01:18:57,833 --> 01:19:00,502
I put up with it because
I felt sorry for you.

902
01:19:01,003 --> 01:19:01,770
What?

903
01:19:01,837 --> 01:19:03,072
You told me...

904
01:19:03,639 --> 01:19:06,809
You never got to be the center
because of Ms. Hwang.

905
01:19:07,343 --> 01:19:09,778
But you're still on the sidelines.

906
01:19:09,845 --> 01:19:12,581
You're just living as a wife
and a mother instead!

907
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:18,587
What else is there?

908
01:19:20,956 --> 01:19:24,360
After everything I sacrificed
for you all these years?

909
01:19:25,194 --> 01:19:27,029
That was for
your own satisfaction!

910
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:30,165
Why are you forcing me to do
something you couldn't?

911
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:32,201
I'm your daughter,

912
01:19:32,268 --> 01:19:34,837
not someone
who has to take your place.

913
01:19:36,639 --> 01:19:38,207
Every time you talk like this,

914
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:39,775
I feel like I'm suffocating.

915
01:19:40,309 --> 01:19:41,944
Just let me be!

916
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:04,800
(Missed call Mom)

917
01:20:04,867 --> 01:20:06,669
Hey, Choi Na-ri!

918
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:09,838
What brings you here?

919
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:14,343
Jeez, you still have that
tight ponytail.

920
01:20:16,879 --> 01:20:18,347
Leave me alone. Get lost.

921
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:21,750
You're letting her talk
to you like that?

922
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:22,584
Damn, no.

923
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:24,353
Get up, wench.

924
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:25,854
Get up!

925
01:20:27,589 --> 01:20:29,358
Just leave me alone
and get lost.

926
01:20:29,425 --> 01:20:31,326
You've got some nerve...

927
01:20:31,393 --> 01:20:33,161
Where are you going, huh?

928
01:20:33,228 --> 01:20:34,796
- Get back here--
- Hey!

929
01:20:34,863 --> 01:20:35,864
What are you doing?

930
01:20:36,598 --> 01:20:37,866
Who the hell are you?

931
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:39,535
Her friend.

932
01:20:40,269 --> 01:20:41,770
What is this?

933
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:47,543
Beat it before I beat
the crap out of you.

934
01:20:50,913 --> 01:20:52,281
Choi Na-ri!

935
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:55,250
Does your mom still hand out
shopping bags?

936
01:20:58,721 --> 01:20:59,788
What?

937
01:21:17,773 --> 01:21:18,473
Hey!

938
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:20,542
It's not fair to jump us
all at once!

939
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:23,412
Take turns or something!

940
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:26,048
What a joke!

941
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:29,385
Good cardio, though.

942
01:21:51,273 --> 01:21:52,408
What was that?

943
01:21:53,842 --> 01:21:55,477
Aren't you good at fighting?

944
01:21:57,312 --> 01:21:59,148
No, I'm really bad.

945
01:22:00,616 --> 01:22:01,850
Then why'd you butt in?

946
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:04,920
Well...

947
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:08,791
I thought maybe I could
scare them off.

948
01:22:22,805 --> 01:22:25,607
Hey, why do you
hate me so much?

949
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:27,743
You're pretty, dance well,

950
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:29,611
and have a rich mom.

951
01:22:30,512 --> 01:22:31,613
It's just...

952
01:22:33,549 --> 01:22:36,051
I'm jealous you get to
live however you want.

953
01:22:37,853 --> 01:22:40,956
You look carefree
and confident.

954
01:22:43,659 --> 01:22:45,360
Like you're the only
happy person around.

955
01:22:46,995 --> 01:22:49,231
I'm just pretending.

956
01:22:49,832 --> 01:22:51,800
You have no idea how
lonely it is to be me.

957
01:22:54,203 --> 01:22:55,504
How come?

958
01:22:56,305 --> 01:22:57,606
Doesn't Park Do-yoon like you?

959
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:02,744
Do you like him?

960
01:23:03,512 --> 01:23:05,314
Are you insane?
Of course not.

961
01:23:07,249 --> 01:23:09,251
Well, I kind of do.

962
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:12,287
But you said you don't!

963
01:23:12,354 --> 01:23:14,389
I need to play hard to get
at first.

964
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:20,863
Ugh!

965
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:22,330
Gosh, I'm starving!

966
01:23:22,397 --> 01:23:23,932
Ugh...

967
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:28,937
Me too.

968
01:23:33,075 --> 01:23:34,776
Jeez.

969
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:36,378
Your hair!

970
01:23:42,217 --> 01:23:45,320
Don't make me laugh.
It hurts.

971
01:23:49,091 --> 01:23:50,459
Madam.

972
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:52,594
I will take the penalty
for this incident.

973
01:23:53,395 --> 01:23:56,131
Could you consider letting
the girls have this show?

974
01:23:56,798 --> 01:23:58,033
Seol-ah.

975
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:00,235
Yes, ma'am?

976
01:24:00,802 --> 01:24:03,605
What would you say
caused this mess?

977
01:24:15,117 --> 01:24:16,251
So...

978
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:19,721
I have something to say.

979
01:24:29,798 --> 01:24:32,734
I'm really sorry.

980
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:42,411
I'm so sorry I was
such a jerk.

981
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,582
I'm sorry too.

982
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:49,084
How about you two?

983
01:24:51,386 --> 01:24:53,021
Come on.

984
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:55,557
Why are we suddenly apologizing?

985
01:24:55,624 --> 01:24:58,360
Then what?
Would you rather cancel the show

986
01:24:58,427 --> 01:25:00,762
and see Ms. Hwang leave?

987
01:25:02,364 --> 01:25:04,599
You two can be pretty fake,

988
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:06,335
but you're not bad people.

989
01:25:15,644 --> 01:25:16,979
- Sorry.
- Same.

990
01:25:20,582 --> 01:25:22,150
I'm sorry too.

991
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:24,553
Sorry.

992
01:25:26,355 --> 01:25:31,360
We can only spread joy when
we ourselves are joyful.

993
01:25:32,027 --> 01:25:36,632
It's better to go hand in hand
than to rush ahead alone.

994
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:42,971
Hold onto that sentiment
as you continue to guide them.

995
01:25:46,008 --> 01:25:48,410
I will, ma'am.

996
01:25:50,078 --> 01:25:51,079
Yes?

997
01:25:58,420 --> 01:25:59,821
M... Madam Chairwoman!

998
01:25:59,888 --> 01:26:00,889
So...

999
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:03,925
Na-ri has something to say!

1000
01:26:06,728 --> 01:26:08,797
Ma'am... I...

1001
01:26:09,498 --> 01:26:10,766
It's all our fault.

1002
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:12,834
Ms. Hwang did nothing wrong.

1003
01:26:12,901 --> 01:26:15,437
She's right. It's all on us.

1004
01:26:15,971 --> 01:26:20,175
We would really like for
Ms. Hwang to stay.

1005
01:26:21,209 --> 01:26:22,644
Yes, please.

1006
01:26:22,711 --> 01:26:25,847
You've taught them well, I see.

1007
01:26:30,752 --> 01:26:34,022
So... About our show...

1008
01:26:35,057 --> 01:26:37,259
Shouldn't you be practicing
with the show days ahead?

1009
01:26:38,593 --> 01:26:40,295
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

1010
01:26:40,362 --> 01:26:42,764
- Let's go!
- Hurry!

1011
01:26:57,212 --> 01:27:04,219
Just like the silent moon
Drifting across the night

1012
01:27:04,286 --> 01:27:08,423
I used to feel so alone

1013
01:27:09,491 --> 01:27:16,331
But then I'd gaze up
Toward that shining light

1014
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:17,733
Go on.

1015
01:27:18,333 --> 01:27:20,669
And let it guide me
With its glow

1016
01:27:21,336 --> 01:27:25,206
Let myself forget my
worries and fears

1017
01:27:25,273 --> 01:27:26,508
Keep going.

1018
01:27:27,109 --> 01:27:33,348
Let it all just wash away

1019
01:27:36,017 --> 01:27:42,090
Because I know deep down
I can go wherever

1020
01:27:42,157 --> 01:27:48,063
I can be whoever,
Whatever I wish to be

1021
01:27:48,130 --> 01:27:55,036
So I'll make my own path
Ever so free

1022
01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:57,806
I'll believe in me

1023
01:27:57,873 --> 01:28:04,045
On the cold nights, early light,
Even the brightest days

1024
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:07,115
Just like the moon
Who keeps her place

1025
01:28:07,182 --> 01:28:10,218
Just like her endless journey

1026
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:15,624
I'll keep on this path
To becoming me

1027
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:45,654
Check that first.

1028
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:52,594
- Hi there.
- Hello.

1029
01:28:52,661 --> 01:28:54,796
- They're beautiful.
- Look at my Ji-eun!

1030
01:29:03,438 --> 01:29:06,007
Curtain's up soon.
Why aren't you ready?

1031
01:29:06,608 --> 01:29:08,510
Here, I'll do your brows.

1032
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:19,554
Thank you, Ms. Hwang.

1033
01:29:19,621 --> 01:29:20,789
For what?

1034
01:29:21,923 --> 01:29:23,058
Just...

1035
01:29:24,459 --> 01:29:25,694
Everything.

1036
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:32,133
You're always the center of
wherever you are.

1037
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:33,702
Enjoy it.

1038
01:29:34,536 --> 01:29:35,870
As long as you're happy,

1039
01:29:35,937 --> 01:29:37,973
the people watching will be too.

1040
01:29:41,476 --> 01:29:44,179
Don't cry.
You'll ruin your makeup.

1041
01:29:44,246 --> 01:29:45,413
Okay.

1042
01:29:46,748 --> 01:29:48,249
Five minutes to curtain.

1043
01:29:48,316 --> 01:29:50,385
Head to the back once
you're ready.

1044
01:29:50,452 --> 01:29:51,720
Yes, ma'am.

1045
01:30:11,573 --> 01:30:15,877
Welcome to Seoul
International Arts.

1046
01:30:15,944 --> 01:30:20,749
Thank you all for joining us in
celebrating our 60th anniversary.

1047
01:30:21,816 --> 01:30:25,253
We have a special show
prepared for you tonight.

1048
01:30:25,754 --> 01:30:30,291
The final showcase of the young
students of our dance company.

1049
01:30:30,358 --> 01:30:35,096
They've trained long and hard to
cultivate their talents.

1050
01:30:35,597 --> 01:30:39,300
Please receive them with
your kind support...

1051
01:30:39,367 --> 01:30:44,839
as they realize their dreams
through unwavering dedication.

1052
01:30:45,707 --> 01:30:51,379
And please welcome them with
a warm round of applause.

1053
01:35:53,748 --> 01:35:54,682
Jeez!

1054
01:35:55,950 --> 01:35:57,985
You should knock!

1055
01:35:58,052 --> 01:36:00,321
Why would I knock in
my own home?

1056
01:36:00,388 --> 01:36:02,323
And why don't I get breakfast?

1057
01:36:02,824 --> 01:36:04,492
You don't eat breakfast.

1058
01:36:04,559 --> 01:36:06,227
I do now.

1059
01:36:06,294 --> 01:36:07,795
Hurry up.

1060
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:10,298
With Spam.

1061
01:36:11,299 --> 01:36:12,366
Ms. Hwang.

1062
01:36:12,433 --> 01:36:14,435
You're filling out a bit
these days.

1063
01:36:14,502 --> 01:36:15,570
Shouldn't you take care of that?

1064
01:36:16,971 --> 01:36:18,840
I have a fast metabolism.

1065
01:36:33,388 --> 01:36:35,323
Can't we eat at the table
for once?

1066
01:36:35,390 --> 01:36:37,325
You know this is child labor?

1067
01:36:38,626 --> 01:36:40,194
You're not a child anymore.

1068
01:36:41,996 --> 01:36:43,331
I'm to blame.

1069
01:36:43,398 --> 01:36:46,301
Why'd I let you be my
legal guardian...

1070
01:36:49,737 --> 01:36:52,173
Try the soup first.
It tastes just right.

1071
01:36:58,513 --> 01:37:00,514
Stop eating just Spam!

1072
01:37:00,581 --> 01:37:02,483
How many times
do I have to nag you?

1073
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:05,019
I can't hear with your yapping!

1074
01:37:19,067 --> 01:37:20,601
Aw, come on!

1075
01:37:21,736 --> 01:37:23,204
Shame on you.

1076
01:37:23,271 --> 01:37:26,074
He takes interest in the female.

1077
01:37:27,942 --> 01:37:33,481
The male lion in heat
approaches the female lion.

1078
01:37:33,548 --> 01:37:37,452
The female receives him.

1079
01:37:39,253 --> 01:37:42,123
You shouldn't be watching
TV while you eat.

1080
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:44,359
After all this time...

1081
01:37:45,059 --> 01:37:46,994
What's for breakfast tomorrow?

1082
01:37:47,061 --> 01:37:49,530
I'm leaving early for my
first day of school!

1083
01:37:50,298 --> 01:37:51,732
Fine.

1084
01:37:51,799 --> 01:37:56,104
Then I'll make myself
a fried egg with some ketchup.

1085
01:38:01,242 --> 01:38:03,478
How are things with Dong-wook,
the pharmacist?

1086
01:38:04,278 --> 01:38:06,280
- I don't date younger men.
- Oh?

1087
01:38:06,781 --> 01:38:08,282
(Incoming call
Wookie)

1088
01:38:10,251 --> 01:38:12,253
What? Dong-wook...

1089
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:13,921
Wookie, huh?

1090
01:38:13,988 --> 01:38:15,923
And you weren't going to tell me?

1091
01:38:17,792 --> 01:38:20,261
You have a boyfriend too!

1092
01:38:20,762 --> 01:38:23,164
I told you, he's not my
boyfriend!

1093
01:38:23,231 --> 01:38:24,565
You held hands.

1094
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:27,034
You kissed?

1095
01:38:27,668 --> 01:38:30,037
- You kissed!
- No, it's not like that.

1096
01:38:30,104 --> 01:38:30,905
When?

1097
01:38:30,972 --> 01:38:32,340
- No, that's not...
- When was it?

1098
01:38:32,407 --> 01:38:34,809
- Come on!
- When did you smooch?

1099
01:38:36,744 --> 01:38:38,746
- Wookie, wookie!
- Smoochy!

1100
01:38:39,647 --> 01:38:41,215
You smooched, didn't you?

1101
01:38:41,282 --> 01:38:42,950
When, where, how?
Spill it.

1102
01:38:43,017 --> 01:38:47,121
Let myself forget my
worries and fears

1103
01:38:47,188 --> 01:38:51,959
Let it all just wash away

1104
01:38:52,026 --> 01:38:54,528
(Chung Su-bin Sim Yi-young)

1105
01:38:54,595 --> 01:39:00,634
Because I know deep down
I can go wherever

1106
01:39:00,701 --> 01:39:06,574
I can be whoever,
Whatever I wish to be

1107
01:39:06,641 --> 01:39:13,581
So I'll make my own path
Ever so free

1108
01:39:13,648 --> 01:39:16,784
I'll believe in me

1109
01:39:16,851 --> 01:39:20,555
Trust this path
Beneath my feet

1110
01:39:23,391 --> 01:39:30,398
I often find myself
Facing a world unknown

1111
01:39:30,465 --> 01:39:35,036
But I know I'll be okay

1112
01:39:35,736 --> 01:39:42,743
Because I know my passion
Guides my way

1113
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:46,914
The bright promise of hope
Leads me on

1114
01:39:47,648 --> 01:39:53,320
Though this journey may
Take more than a beat

1115
01:39:53,387 --> 01:39:59,126
I know we'll reach
The end someday

1116
01:39:59,193 --> 01:40:05,266
Because I know deep down
I can go wherever

1117
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:11,172
I can be whoever,
Whatever I wish to be

1118
01:40:11,239 --> 01:40:18,145
So I'll make my own path
Ever so free

1119
01:40:18,212 --> 01:40:20,981
I'll believe in me

1120
01:40:21,048 --> 01:40:27,188
On the cold nights, early light,
Even the brightest days

1121
01:40:27,255 --> 01:40:30,291
Just like the moon
Who keeps her place

1122
01:40:30,358 --> 01:40:33,360
Just like her endless journey

1123
01:40:33,427 --> 01:40:38,766
I'll keep on this path
To becoming me

1124
01:40:42,303 --> 01:40:49,243
Because I know deep down
I can go wherever

1125
01:40:49,944 --> 01:40:56,050
I can be whoever
I wish to be

1126
01:40:56,117 --> 01:41:01,989
I can already see her
Soaring ahead of me

1127
01:41:02,056 --> 01:41:08,896
So I'll make my own path
Ever so free

1128
01:41:08,963 --> 01:41:11,932
I'll believe in me

1129
01:41:11,999 --> 01:41:15,202
I'll do it for me

1130
01:41:15,269 --> 01:41:19,140
I'll become the me
Of my dreams
