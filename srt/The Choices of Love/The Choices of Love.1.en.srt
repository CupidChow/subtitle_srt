00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,040
(This drama is based on
a true story.)

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,040
(The plot was adjusted
for entertainment purposes only.)

3
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,040
(We have no intention
to offend any careers,)

4
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,040
(encourage immoral sexual values,)

5
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,040
(or create a pessimistic disposition
of a gender or a group of people.)

6
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,840
(We would like to apologize in
advance for any misunderstandings.)

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,400
(Presents)

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,320
(Theory of Love)

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,480
Let’s celebrate our On-the-Rise
Company of the Year Award!

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,800
Where’s the boss?

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,960
The boss? Over there.

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,960
I’m here!

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,680
I'm so hot. Are you hot?

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,640
- Woo!
- Of course.

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,000
I’m even more effervescent than
this soda!

16
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,400
May.

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,280
May!

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,200
What are you doing on the table?
Come down. You'll fall.

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,680
Come on, Pat.

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,040
Aren’t you feeling unwell? You said
you were going home early.

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,280
I’ll leave soon.

22
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,120
You should go. Don’t worry.

23
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,560
Leave with me now.

24
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,280
It’s late.

25
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,920
And the air’s bad.
You’ll get sick again. Let's go.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,080
What? Fine, I’ll go.

27
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,640
Let me take you home.

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,080
No, I’ll go by myself.

29
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,600
Seriously, Pat...

30
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,880
I’m not drunk. I haven't had a drop.

31
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,960
I’m just enjoying hanging out
with everyone.

32
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,760
You should head home.
I’ll go by myself.

33
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,560
Pass me my purse.

34
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,360
Drink as much as you want,
I’ve already paid.

35
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,080
Get home safe, May.

36
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,520
May.

37
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,880
Check the traffic light, will you?

38
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,360
Go get
your driver’s license already.

39
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,200
May.

40
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,640
May, open the door.

41
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,240
May.

42
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,160
Are you okay? Did you hit your head?

43
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,360
Did you just black out?

44
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,960
I’m fine, Pat.

45
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,720
You’re not drunk, are you?

46
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,680
Then why did you almost
run a red light?

47
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,160
Should I call an ambulance?

48
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,400
Can you not make a big deal of it?

49
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,520
It was just a small accident.

50
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,120
Why are you freaking out so much?

51
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,120
Of course I’m freaking out.
I’m worried about you.

52
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,720
The doctor told you to rest,
but you wouldn’t.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,280
You stayed up all night working
and then went out partying.

54
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,440
How could I not be worried?

55
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,840
Pat, I’ve always lived like this.
You never had a problem with it.

56
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,360
So why is it a problem today?

57
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,080
Because I care about you.

58
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
No, Pat.

59
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,960
We’re just too different.

60
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,800
You know that, don’t you?

61
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,120
Admit the truth. Stop forcing it.

62
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
Let’s break up.

63
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,120
Calm down, May.

64
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,320
Pat.

65
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,600
This way, you won’t have to drag
me away from my staff like just now.

66
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,920
May, I'm sorry.

67
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,200
I know you’re only saying this
because you’re mad.

68
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,440
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,040
- No, Pat.
- I...

70
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,520
We're just not compatible.

71
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,080
May.

72
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,800
I won’t say anything again.

73
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,120
I just have one request.

74
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,160
You work too hard,
please take care of yourself.

75
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,800
The doctor warned you about your
health. You need to rest more.

76
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,040
Please, I’m really worried
about you.

77
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,880
May.

78
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,840
Think about it carefully.

79
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,640
I love you, May.

80
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,320
Please calm down.

81
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,400
I really care about you.

82
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,600
I want to take better care of you.

83
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,920
May.

84
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Marry me.

85
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,920
If you don’t answer,
I’ll take that as a yes.

86
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,920
Move in with me tomorrow

87
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,720
so I can take care of you.

88
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,720
I love you.

89
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
I promise

90
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,680
I’ll take good care of you.

91
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,040
Aoy and Chod, I’ve known Pat
since we were in college.

92
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,800
We’re very different.

93
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,360
No one ever thought we’d work out.

94
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,720
I’m "Sexy May" to my friends,

95
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,360
and Pat is a serious man.

96
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,600
(Three Years Ago)

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,360
May.

98
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,760
May.

99
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,640
May.

100
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,480
I'll be right back. May.

101
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,520
Pat has always been such a good man
since the day I met him.

102
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,600
Not once has he ever
treated me badly.

103
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,280
Pat.

104
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,680
Put me down, I’m fine.

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,200
I’m fine, you can let me go now.

106
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,600
Are you sure?

107
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,280
You seemed tired earlier.

108
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,480
I'm sure.

109
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,360
I’m just a little dizzy
because I didn’t get enough sleep.

110
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,080
I had to work at the shooting set
last night.

111
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,960
You slept late, didn’t you?

112
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,160
No, I slept in the morning.

113
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,480
You seem to enjoy
doing stuff like this.

114
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,560
You used to pull all-nighters
all the time.

115
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Of course.

116
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,360
I only live once,
I have to live it to the fullest.

117
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,560
I don’t want to go to bed at 8 p.m.
like you, that’s too boring.

118
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,400
I’m just worried about you.

119
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,240
Thank you

120
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,040
for always caring about me,
no matter what.

121
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,560
I’ll feel better
after I go wash my face.

122
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,280
May.

123
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,880
I don’t know if I’ll ever see you
again after this graduation party.

124
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,120
I’m sure you know
how I’ve felt about you

125
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,720
all this time.

126
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,680
I like you.

127
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,400
If you’re not seeing anyone,

128
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,080
would you give me a chance?

129
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,360
Sure.

130
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,880
Why don’t we give it a shot?

131
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,560
I...

132
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,520
Are you serious?

133
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,560
Yes.

134
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,560
I was waiting to see

135
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,240
when you’d have the courage
to bring this up.

136
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,560
I guess

137
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,600
you’ve had plenty to drink tonight.

138
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,240
So I decided to date him
for one reason.

139
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,640
He’s always been good to me.

140
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
Please wait.

141
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,960
Are you tired? Do you want to rest?

142
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,920
We’d like to take a break.

143
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,240
- Of course.
- Thanks.

144
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,600
You’ve been busy, right?

145
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,520
It’s a good thing
you let me handle the wedding.

146
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,440
Don’t worry,
I’ll take care of everything.

147
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,400
I just want you to get more rest

148
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,320
so that you'll look beautiful
at the wedding.

149
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,160
I need to make a call
about the invitations.

150
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,000
Even though Pat is great
and loves me a lot,

151
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,200
I don’t know why,

152
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,160
the closer the wedding gets,

153
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,600
the more unsure I feel.

154
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,560
Here's your water.

155
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,760
Thank you.

156
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,160
The photographer will be back soon.

157
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,960
Surprise.

158
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,360
The place looks great, Kit.

159
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,960
People will enjoy this vibe because
they’re not just coming to drink,

160
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,080
they’re coming for the experience

161
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,440
and to find somewhere nice
to take photos for social media.

162
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,480
You need some colorful signature
drinks for people to show off,

163
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,360
or maybe a live band,
I think that would be nice.

164
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,800
I definitely chose
the right person to consult.

165
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,520
You’re a Comm Arts girl
with a real knack for marketing.

166
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,640
No way. I’m just speaking
from all my experience partying.

167
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,880
I don’t have
a knack for marketing at all.

168
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,080
I’m just a normal customer.

169
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,520
But still, I really did
pick the right person to consult.

170
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,720
You know,

171
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,560
I think

172
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,360
you and I have a lot in common.

173
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,520
If we put our heads together

174
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,720
and start a business together,

175
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,320
it could turn out really well.

176
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,200
Besides, I know

177
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
how you feel

178
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,400
about me.

179
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,520
You’re beautiful, brilliant,

180
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,800
and smart.

181
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,280
I like you, May.

182
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,120
Kit.

183
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
I...

184
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,320
I have a boyfriend.

185
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,520
You do?

186
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,840
Who’s your boyfriend?

187
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,000
I just agreed to date Pat.

188
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,120
Pat?

189
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,720
You're dating Pat?

190
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,920
I can’t believe plain-old Pat

191
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,200
is dating a hot girl like Sexy May.

192
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,040
He’s really good to me,

193
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,360
so I wanted to give him a chance.

194
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,360
- I see.
- Well...

195
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,640
But if you want my advice
on your bar,

196
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,360
I’m willing to help.

197
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,520
Thank you.

198
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,080
I’ll get going then.

199
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,480
Okay.

200
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,120
How are you, my beautiful girl?

201
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,960
Kit.

202
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,840
You’re back, long time no see.

203
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,640
I came back to Thailand
not long ago.

204
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,640
My partner wanted to take a break,

205
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,800
so I’ll be managing it.

206
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,600
I saw it on my social media feed

207
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,120
that you're doing your pre-wedding
shoot here, so I wanted to say hi.

208
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,760
And congratulations.

209
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,560
Thank you.
I didn’t think you’d be back.

210
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,680
I’d like to invite you
to our wedding.

211
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,200
I’ll send you an invitation
once they're ready.

212
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,600
Sure. Where’s Pat?

213
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,520
He’s on the phone.

214
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,840
I see.

215
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,920
I never thought I’d see Sexy May
in a wedding dress.

216
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,880
You look gorgeous.

217
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,800
You’re exaggerating, Kit.

218
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,520
When will I get to go
to your wedding?

219
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,600
Probably not anytime soon.
I’m single.

220
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
I just broke up with my girlfriend.

221
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,440
- I see.
- I have to go, so I won’t see Pat.

222
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,400
Tell him I said hi. See you then.

223
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Sure.

224
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,440
What a great year for you.

225
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,600
Your advertising agency just won
that On-the-Rise Award,

226
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,080
and you're getting married.

227
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,520
Lucky in game, lucky in love.

228
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,800
Congratulations again.

229
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,080
Let me give you a hug.
I’ve missed you.

230
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,080
Congratulations,
my beautiful sister.

231
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,520
Thank you.

232
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,400
See you.

233
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,520
(Kit)

234
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,080
Yes, Kit?

235
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,400
Am I bothering you?

236
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,440
I can talk.

237
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:46,240
I wanted to ask you
to help promote my bar.

238
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,760
I’m not sure if you’re available.

239
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
Really?

240
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,560
I’m happy to help you.

241
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,360
You can drop by my office anytime.

242
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,680
Let’s go somewhere comfortable,

243
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,480
like my bar.

244
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,600
Is that okay with you?

245
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,600
Well...

246
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,480
I like you, May.

247
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,720
We can decide on the location later.

248
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,320
Thank you for picking up
my call so late.

249
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,720
Good night.

250
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,080
Bye.

251
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
May.

252
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,160
- May.
- Yes?

253
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,520
Hey.

254
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,600
Is everything okay?
You don’t usually lock the door.

255
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,920
I probably locked it by accident.

256
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,240
I just finished my work,

257
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,040
so I wanted to help my bride-to-be

258
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,400
choose the pre-wedding photos.

259
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,040
I can’t let you do that alone.

260
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,440
Okay.

261
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,080
Come sit with me.

262
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,400
When we were taking these photos

263
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,000
and I saw you in a wedding dress,

264
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,480
I was so happy.

265
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,200
It made me realize
I made the right decision

266
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,680
when I asked you to date me
at the graduation party.

267
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,880
I made the right decision.

268
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,360
I love you.

269
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,200
Which photos do you like?

270
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,640
This one’s cute.

271
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,440
I agree.

272
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,560
I really picked the right person
to consult again.

273
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,800
You gave great advice
on my bar’s promotion plan.

274
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,160
I’m not surprised at all
that your company

275
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,800
won the On-the-Rise Award
in just three years.

276
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,800
You’re amazing.

277
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,880
Thank you, Kit.

278
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,440
Today,

279
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,520
you look so pretty.

280
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,080
Do you always dress up this nicely
to meet your clients?

281
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,480
Of course.

282
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,920
They wouldn't call me Sexy May

283
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,600
if I didn't look this hot.

284
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,240
You're right.

285
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,200
I’m so jealous of Pat.

286
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,400
He’s one lucky guy

287
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,640
to have a beautiful lady like you.

288
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,760
Your wedding is coming up.
I wish you both happiness.

289
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,280
If I were Pat, I’d be so worried,

290
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,600
having such a fabulous girlfriend

291
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,720
who’s so different from him,

292
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,200
who’s so plain.

293
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,280
Sorry, I’m probably saying too much
because I’ve had a few drinks.

294
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,480
It’s okay. You’re right.

295
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,880
When I’m with Pat,

296
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,280
I feel like we’re so different.

297
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,240
I...

298
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,840
Here.

299
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,480
This is our invitation.

300
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,320
I’d like to officially invite you.

301
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,240
Okay.

302
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,560
Congratulations again.

303
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,040
You probably have so much
on your mind.

304
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,280
You’ve given me advice
so many times.

305
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,560
If you ever want to talk to me,
I’m happy to listen.

306
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,520
Thank you.

307
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,600
Well...

308
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,960
I'll get going then.

309
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,440
Get home safely.

310
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,080
Yes, Pat?

311
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,800
I thought you said
you wouldn’t be home late.

312
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,800
I’m on my way home.

313
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,520
Are you drunk?

314
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,640
Can you drive?

315
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,120
Do you want me to pick you up?

316
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,080
It’s okay, Pat. Don’t worry.
See you at home.

317
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,280
May.

318
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,280
May.

319
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,040
May.

320
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,640
May.

321
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,560
May, get up slowly.

322
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,360
Excuse me.

323
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,960
Are you okay?

324
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,960
Call the ambulance.

325
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,560
- Okay.
- Thank you.

326
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Are you okay?

327
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,880
It’s a good thing
you weren’t badly injured.

328
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,560
How did you fall down the stairs?

329
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,240
I was probably walking too quickly.

330
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,840
Why?

331
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,640
Because you were afraid of Pat?

332
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,120
I usually see men afraid
of their girlfriends,

333
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,960
but you’re afraid of a man like Pat?

334
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,280
I don’t want him to worry too much,

335
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,920
so I just wanted
to get home quickly.

336
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,520
I understand him.

337
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,640
Lately, I’ve been working late
for several days in a row,

338
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,840
until I fainted from exhaustion.

339
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,000
But sometimes,

340
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,560
his worry makes me uncomfortable.

341
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,320
I have a lot of work to do,

342
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,280
and sometimes I get home late
because I have to attend parties.

343
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,040
It’s necessary because I have to
socialize for work.

344
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,920
I tried to explain it to him,

345
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,600
but it feels like
he just doesn’t get it.

346
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,080
But I do.

347
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,320
Like I’ve told you before,
we have a lot in common.

348
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,120
We understand each other
without having to explain.

349
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,760
I think Pat actually understands.

350
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,080
He just worries about you too much.

351
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,560
I think he’ll be here soon.

352
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,040
Do you mind leaving?

353
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,520
I didn’t tell him I was out
with you, I’m sorry.

354
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,880
It’s okay, I get it.

355
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,760
Get well soon.

356
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,520
Excuse me, which room
is Maysa Warakul in?

357
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,800
Please wait here.

358
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,880
- Hello, Pat.
- May.

359
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,200
Which room are you in?

360
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,040
- I’m in 302.
- How many times have I told you...

361
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,760
Where is room 302?

362
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,920
Go this way.

363
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,360
Thank you.

364
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,680
How many times must I repeat myself?

365
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,920
This is because you’re a workaholic
and your body can’t handle it.

366
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,680
It’s nothing, Pat.

367
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,600
I was hurrying home to see you,
that’s why I got hurt.

368
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,000
I’ve already explained
my work to you.

369
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,800
I understand.

370
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,280
Is receiving the On-the-Rise Award
worth it? It isn’t.

371
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,440
We’re talking about
your health here.

372
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,440
That means you don’t understand
my work at all.

373
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,840
I’ve explained it to you
so many times.

374
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,720
This is how I work.

375
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,840
It’s never been a problem before,
so why is it a problem now?

376
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,760
I understand,
but do you understand me?

377
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,040
I’m just worried about you,
that’s all.

378
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,640
Do you understand me at all?

379
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,640
I understand that you’re worried,

380
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,800
but the way you’re acting makes me
really uncomfortable.

381
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,120
We’re just too different, Pat.

382
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,200
After living together,
I realized we don’t get along.

383
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,080
You live a daytime life,
I live a nighttime life.

384
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,320
This is who I am. I can’t change it
because it’s my work.

385
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,720
If we keep living like this,

386
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,600
you’ll be exhausted because of me,
and I’m not okay with that.

387
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,520
I think

388
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,520
we should live separately.

389
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,840
- I’ll go back home and you...
- May.

390
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,000
May, calm down.

391
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,760
No.

392
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,080
Why live separately?

393
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,600
I'm sorry.

394
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,240
I'm sorry
for making you uncomfortable.

395
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,480
I’m so sorry.
Please don’t go anywhere.

396
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,120
I...

397
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,600
I promise I’ll try
to understand your work.

398
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,680
You have to understand me too,
I’m just worried about you.

399
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,440
That’s it. I’m worried about you.

400
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,760
I'm serious.

401
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,840
Please calm down.

402
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,240
May.

403
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,560
Walk slowly.

404
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,280
Does it hurt?

405
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,320
I'm much better now.

406
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,160
But it hurts a little.

407
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,240
Slowly.

408
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,240
You need to rest a lot.

409
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,520
I still have so much work to do.

410
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,520
May.

411
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,840
I understand that you’re worried
about work,

412
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,600
but you should worry
about yourself too.

413
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,280
Can you ask someone else
to handle it for now?

414
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,080
If not, go talk to the clients.

415
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,880
I’m sure they’ll understand,
it’s beyond your control.

416
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,640
Right now, you need to rest.

417
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,600
Sleep and eat more,
so you’ll heal faster.

418
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,320
Once you’ve recovered,
you can go back to work.

419
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,240
Let me know you're hungry,
I’ll get you something to eat.

420
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,560
Pat.

421
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,640
Honestly, aren’t you tired of me
being like this?

422
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,520
Not at all.

423
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,200
You know how much I love you.

424
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,000
I’ll get you something to eat.

425
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,280
I'm back.

426
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,200
Thank you.

427
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,960
Eat something so you can
take your medicine and rest.

428
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,600
I don’t feel like eating.

429
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,320
Fine, you don’t have to eat now.

430
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,800
Do you want to rest?

431
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,360
Okay.

432
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,400
Be careful.

433
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,480
- Let me know if it hurts.
- Okay.

434
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,080
Does it hurt?

435
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,800
Okay.

436
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,600
Here you go.

437
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,120
It's still swollen.

438
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,800
Does it hurt?

439
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
Thank you.

440
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,440
Like I said,

441
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,760
I’ll take care of you.

442
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,240
I love you.

443
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,520
Aoy and Chod.

444
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,840
He’s so good to me
it makes me feel guilty.

445
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,440
If I choose to leave
someone who loves me,

446
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,840
I'd feel sorry for him,

447
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,920
and I’d regret it too.

448
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,480
Did you send the first draft
to the client?

449
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,600
Please update me.

450
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,520
Okay.

451
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,640
- Hello, Pat?
- Are you free this evening?

452
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,920
I want to take you out for dinner.

453
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,240
We haven’t eaten out in a while.

454
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,720
I got my paycheck today. It’s on me.

455
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,400
Tell me what you want to eat.

456
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,080
I’m busy today.

457
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,920
Maybe next time?

458
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,400
Really?

459
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,280
Sure, it's fine.

460
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,760
We can go next time.
You can just work today.

461
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,280
Pat.

462
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,880
Would it be okay

463
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,560
if we go at 8 or 9 p.m. today?

464
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,120
Of course.

465
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,920
That’s fine with me.
I’ll wait for you.

466
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,360
There’s no need to rush.
Take your time.

467
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,640
Okay, I’ll call you after work.

468
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,080
Sure, I’ll hang up now.

469
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,760
Good luck.

470
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,720
Nicky, did the client give us
any feedback?

471
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,080
Tomorrow?

472
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,840
Okay, then we don’t have to stay
and make any edits.

473
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,920
Thank you.

474
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,840
Is receiving

475
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,120
the On-the-Rise Award worth
sacrificing your health?

476
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,920
It's not worth it at all.

477
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,160
Surprise.

478
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,480
Kit.

479
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,280
This is why I like surprising you.

480
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,320
You look so funny
when you’re surprised.

481
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,600
Congratulations.

482
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,800
I’d like to officially
congratulate you on your award.

483
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,240
Thank you so much.

484
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,560
I got you this too.

485
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,560
I think you’ll like this more
than the bouquet.

486
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Thank you.

487
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,800
Wow, your office looks amazing.

488
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,720
Not just anyone can do this.

489
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,000
Besides being skilled,
you have to be dedicated

490
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,080
to build your own company

491
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,840
and win this On-the-Rise Award
within three years.

492
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,040
I can see

493
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,440
how much this award means to you.

494
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,000
Thank you so much.

495
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,920
Are you free?

496
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,160
I want to consult you
about my bar’s promotion plan.

497
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,440
Sure, I’m done for today.

498
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:18,920
Would you like to have a drink
while we talk? I’m fine with it.

499
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,480
Well...

500
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,640
I usually don’t let my staff
drink at the office,

501
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,400
but rules are meant to be broken.

502
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,360
Don’t be too serious about it.

503
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:42,240
Wait, you have
wine glasses in your office?

504
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,480
I was joking earlier.

505
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,840
But I’m serious.

506
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,480
My staff will leave soon.

507
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,520
We can have a few drinks.
It should be fine.

508
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,320
How long has it been since
we had such a fun talk?

509
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,280
Ever since you moved abroad.

510
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,800
No.

511
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,400
Ever since

512
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,440
you started dating Pat.

513
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,360
(Pat)

514
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,400
Excuse me.

515
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,560
Pat.

516
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:08,040
I’m sorry. I was busy at work
and I forgot we had a date.

517
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,200
I knew you’d forget our dinner date.

518
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,080
You probably forgot to eat too.

519
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,960
I came by to drop off some food.

520
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,240
Where are you?

521
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,440
I’m in front of your office.

522
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,800
What?

523
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,680
May.

524
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,120
May.

525
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,720
Kit, do you mind waiting here?

526
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,680
If Pat sees you,
we’ll have a problem.

527
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,880
May.

528
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,960
- Pat.
- May.

529
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,960
I’m sorry I didn’t tell you

530
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,960
I wasn’t free anymore.

531
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,680
Wait.

532
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,440
Were you drinking?

533
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,240
Well...

534
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,880
I had a drink with the team.

535
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,400
You just fell down the stairs
and the doctor said no drinking.

536
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,960
Why did you do that?

537
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,120
I think you might be an alcoholic.

538
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,160
May, you're at the office.

539
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,040
You drink at parties, and now you’re
drinking here. I’m not okay with it.

540
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,280
Pat.

541
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,800
Let some things be my business.

542
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,640
How could you say that?

543
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,360
I’m just worried about you.

544
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,640
Pat, I'm fine.

545
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,280
This is my office.

546
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,520
If you don’t support
or understand what I do,

547
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,200
then at least let me do what I want.

548
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,840
It's not like that.

549
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,200
It’s not that I don’t support you.
I’m just worried.

550
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,440
Leave me alone.

551
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,880
Do you realize

552
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,160
you’re making me
more and more uncomfortable, Pat?

553
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,560
Give me some space to breathe.

554
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,000
Leave. If you don’t leave,
I’ll never speak to you again.

555
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,200
I'm sorry

556
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,960
for making you uncomfortable.

557
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,040
I'll leave.

558
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,680
Here's your food.

559
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,920
I'm worried about you.

560
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:11,040
I’m sorry
for making you wait so long.

561
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,760
I waited for him to get in the car
and actually leave.

562
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,520
It's fine.

563
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,520
I understand.

564
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,400
Did you get into a fight with him

565
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,640
because of me?

566
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,760
No, Kit.

567
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,880
I don’t know what’s gotten into him.
He always makes me uncomfortable.

568
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,800
I think we should call it a night.

569
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,560
No.

570
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,360
You’re uncomfortable
and got into a fight with him

571
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,120
because you’re the only
one adjusting.

572
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,240
I heard him say
he’s worried about you,

573
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,120
but I don’t see him
adjusting to you.

574
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,520
Why don’t you ignore him tonight?

575
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,280
Be yourself.

576
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,600
Just care about yourself.

577
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,240
Let him be the one to adjust to you.

578
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,520
Come with me.

579
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,640
Don’t worry about anything.
Forget everything.

580
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,320
Because this is your life, May.

581
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,000
(Pat)

582
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,640
Nop, you don't need to worry
about me when it comes to money.

583
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,280
I found someone to help me.

584
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,920
This one,

585
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,440
I won't let slip.

586
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,880
- Hello, Pat.
- Hello.

587
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,080
My girlfriend has been very busy,

588
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,440
so I asked you to help out.

589
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,120
Have you seen her?

590
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,520
Not yet.

591
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,760
Okay.

592
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,200
Thank you.

593
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,280
- Go ahead.
- Excuse me.

594
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,960
May.

595
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,760
Where were you all night? You didn’t
answer my calls. What happened?

596
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,200
I...

597
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,840
I spent the night
at a subordinate's place.

598
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,560
I left my phone at the office.

599
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,160
May.

600
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,360
I'm really sorry
for making you uncomfortable.

601
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,920
I promise I will do better.

602
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,800
Pat.

603
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,200
Can we postpone

604
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,320
our wedding?

605
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:47,680
Don’t stay with someone just because
they're good to you.

606
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,560
What are you doing here?

607
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,480
I’m applying for a job
at your company.

608
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,200
It’s nice to have Pat help out.

609
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,280
I'm glad we're partners.

610
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,800
Likewise.

611
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,080
Just like this.

612
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,000
Apply the cream here.

613
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,560
It hurts.

614
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,680
Just like that.

615
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,240
How did you get the name Sexy May?

616
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,560
Just May.

617
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,840
Yes.

618
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,760
I need some soda.

619
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,920
Don't go far.

620
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,280
Stay right here.
