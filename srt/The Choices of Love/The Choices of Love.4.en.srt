1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,040
(This drama is based on a true story.)

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,040
(The plot was adjusted for entertainment purposes only.)

3
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,040
(We have no intention to offend any careers, )

4
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,040
(encourage immoral sexual values, )

5
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,040
(or create a pessimistic disposition of a gender or a group of people.)

6
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:07,840
(We would like to apologize in advance for any misunderstandings.)

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,400
(Presents)

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,360
(Theory of Love)

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,000
You still haven’t come home.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,640
I can’t let you have all the fun.

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,640
You’re keeping a secret from me, aren’t you?

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,080
Tell me!

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,920
Pat.

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,040
Let's break up.

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,040
Once your car’s fixed,

16
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,120
I’ll have the mechanic drop it off at your office.

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,720
Okay.

18
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,840
You can get there on your own?

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,360
Yes, I’ll just take a taxi.

20
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
Pat.

21
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,960
I'll get going.

22
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,800
It’s strange, Aoy and Chod.

23
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,960
Breaking up with Pat makes me really upset,

24
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,960
but I also feel this relief I can’t quite explain.

25
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,640
I’ve finally let go of the man who loves me,

26
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,040
so he doesn’t have to force himself to do things for me anymore.

27
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,840
May.

28
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,200
Krit.

29
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,160
I was worried about you, so I drove over to check on you.

30
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,280
I wanted to call, but I didn’t want to cause trouble.

31
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,440
So I parked a bit further away from Pat’s place.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,280
What’s wrong?

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Where are you going?

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,240
I’m not sure yet.

35
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,160
I was just about to get a taxi.

36
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,440
Why don’t you come with me?

37
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,040
It's okay, May.

38
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,040
It's okay.

39
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,240
I'm here for you.

40
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,440
When we were taking pre-wedding photos,

41
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,960
and I saw you in a wedding dress,

42
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,600
I was so happy.

43
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,800
May.

44
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,680
- Pat. - Where should we do it?

45
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,560
- Hey. - Right here.

46
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,200
I let go of the man who loves me

47
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,000
and chose to start over with the man I love.

48
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,720
I just hope my decision

49
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,760
is the right one.

50
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,680
(One Month Later)

51
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,160
Are you still thinking about it?

52
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,200
Yes.

53
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,680
Has Pat contacted you at all?

54
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,920
Not at all.

55
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,160
He’s probably really mad at me.

56
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,480
But I understand.

57
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,920
Even if he never wants to talk to me,

58
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,920
I still want to be friends. We’ve known each other for so long.

59
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,040
But I won’t reach out.

60
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,800
It’s better this way.

61
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,520
Don't overthink it.

62
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,680
It’ll all get better someday.

63
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
Give him some time.

64
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,040
Most importantly,

65
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,800
give yourself some time too.

66
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,720
Smile, May.

67
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,200
Today is your special day.

68
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,840
I want you to be happy.

69
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,040
Happy birthday again.

70
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,320
Happy birthday to you

71
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,000
Happy birthday to you

72
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,440
Happy birthday, happy birthday

73
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,360
Happy birthday to you

74
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,840
Happy birthday, Sexy May.

75
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,240
We wish you happiness.

76
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,920
Thank you.

77
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,639
- Happy birthday. - Happy birthday.

78
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,920
Happy birthday.

79
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,639
Don’t forget our bonuses.

80
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,960
That's right.

81
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,120
Yes!

82
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,880
Happy birthday, May.

83
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,320
I wish you happiness.

84
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,760
I'll always care about you.

85
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,120
We'll get going.

86
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,160
See you at the office.

87
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,079
Bye.

88
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,959
- Bye. - Bye.

89
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,960
- Get home safely. - Bye.

90
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,320
Bye.

91
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,880
You told me you needed some time to think.

92
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,280
I think it’s time to make a decision.

93
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,920
You might act like everything’s normal,

94
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,680
but everyone can see what’s going on between us.

95
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,440
I know

96
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,000
it might be a bit soon,

97
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,080
but I want you to move on.

98
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,760
I want to see you happy.

99
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,880
Will you start over with me?

100
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I promise

101
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,920
I'll take good care of you.

102
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,240
Okay.

103
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,600
Ever since I decided to date Krit,

104
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,240
he asked me to move in.

105
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,000
I can tell he’s serious about our relationship.

106
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,400
I’m becoming happier and happier.

107
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,840
It feels like I made the right decision to be with someone I love

108
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,680
rather than someone who loves me.

109
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,760
Pat.

110
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,320
What are you doing here?

111
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,240
I’m here to pick up my last paycheck.

112
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
But don’t worry.

113
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,560
I won’t have to come here anymore.

114
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,760
Happy belated birthday.

115
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,600
How are you?

116
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,480
Good.

117
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,360
Thank you.

118
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,560
Bye.

119
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,840
Hello.

120
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,880
My ID card?

121
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,360
I totally forgot.

122
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,960
I'll come back and get it.

123
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,880
So, everything’s done?

124
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,080
All these documents...

125
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,880
- May won’t... - Shh.

126
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,840
Just ask May to sign them quickly.

127
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Okay.

128
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,040
Yes, I'm on my way.

129
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,640
Who’s calling you? You can take it.

130
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,960
It's fine.

131
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,040
The number’s unfamiliar. I won’t answer.

132
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,840
My friend dropped by with the documents to sign.

133
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,160
The bar contract we talked about the other day.

134
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,760
The accounting team is waiting on them, so he stopped by.

135
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,120
Okay, I’ll sign them quickly.

136
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,920
(Partnership Agreement)

137
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,920
The second partner.

138
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,960
Here you go.

139
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,280
All done. I’ll take care of the rest, don’t worry.

140
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,800
Thank you so much.

141
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,120
Krit.

142
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,240
Here.

143
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,280
It's a check for five million baht. I said that I'd help with

144
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,600
the amount your friend cheated you out of.

145
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,520
- May. - Take it.

146
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,440
I really want to help.

147
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,280
Thank you so much.

148
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,240
- Excuse me. - Yes?

149
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,560
Can I ask you something?

150
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,600
Who’s the owner of this bar?

151
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,919
I came here once and really enjoyed it.

152
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,400
I’m interested in buying some shares.

153
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,520
The bar owner’s name is Krit.

154
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,800
Many of his friends are partners.

155
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,640
Do you know anyone called Sexy May?

156
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,400
Oh, she’s Krit’s girlfriend.

157
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,560
Is she a partner too?

158
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,120
I’m not sure.

159
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,480
I see.

160
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,080
Thank you.

161
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,240
Krit.

162
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,480
So, what did May say about the documents?

163
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,960
She didn’t say anything,

164
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,480
but she already signed them.

165
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,760
What?

166
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,360
She's not suspicious at all.

167
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,120
We’ll talk later.

168
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,440
Thanks.

169
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,560
Let's order.

170
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
What do you want?

171
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I...

172
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,000
I need to use the restroom.

173
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,480
Sure.

174
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,120
Pat.

175
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,640
Pat, what are you trying to do?

176
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,960
What do you mean?

177
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,280
You don’t even like going to bars, so why are you here?

178
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,200
You came to see me at the office on purpose, didn’t you?

179
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,720
When you called me, it’s not that I didn’t want to talk to you.

180
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,000
But the more you do this, the guiltier I feel. Don’t do this.

181
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Okay.

182
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,240
I admit it, I wanted to see you.

183
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,560
But I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable.

184
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,200
I’m sorry if I did.

185
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,040
Stop it, Pat. Don't apologize to me.

186
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,480
I’m the one who was wrong. You didn’t do anything wrong.

187
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,200
But if you want us to get back together,

188
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,040
I don’t want to hurt you again.

189
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,680
I know that.

190
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,240
I just want you to know

191
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,600
that meeting you at the office was really a coincidence.

192
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,560
I went to pick up my check.

193
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,280
I called you because I wanted to warn you.

194
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,400
But meeting you here

195
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,360
was intentional.

196
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,080
I was suspicious about Krit, so I came.

197
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,600
What do you mean?

198
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,920
I want to warn you.

199
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,880
If you plan to invest in this bar, check everything carefully.

200
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,520
Pat.

201
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,640
Krit’s not a bad person, don’t worry.

202
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,320
I knew

203
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,080
you wouldn’t believe me.

204
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,040
Just ask May to sign them quickly.

205
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,360
Krit.

206
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,560
So, what did May say about the documents?

207
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,480
She didn't say anything, but she already signed them.

208
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,600
She's not suspicious at all.

209
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
We'll talk later.

210
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,320
It’s nothing, Pat.

211
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,760
That’s just how Krit talks to his friends.

212
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,280
Honestly, May.

213
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,000
The day you moved out and Krit was waiting for you.

214
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,520
He saw me,

215
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,920
and the look in his eyes wasn’t trustworthy.

216
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,480
Krit’s not a bad person.

217
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,760
I know what you’re thinking,

218
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,560
but please don’t think badly of him.

219
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,920
I know you’ll never believe me,

220
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,840
but please, May.

221
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,240
I’m really suspicious about this.

222
00:18:50,241 --> 00:18:51,479
I don’t want anything bad to happen to you.

223
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,480
Please believe me.

224
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,959
I’m not helping you because I want us to get back together.

225
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,480
I know that’s impossible.

226
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,520
You know

227
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,920
I truly wish you well.

228
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,520
There's no hidden agenda.

229
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,720
I’m just worried about you,

230
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,640
and I always will be.

231
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,200
I ordered wine for you.

232
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,320
Thank you.

233
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,200
Let's drink.

234
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,720
Cheers.

235
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,320
Work problems?

236
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,640
You seemed stressed when were at the bar.

237
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
No.

238
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,320
I'll take a shower.

239
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,240
Sure.

240
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,280
May, we'll get going.

241
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,520
- Sure. - Okay.

242
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,080
Bye, see you.

243
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Bye.

244
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
Do you want to leave?

245
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,440
Sure.

246
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,400
I’m feeling a little dizzy. Let me go freshen up.

247
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,080
Sure.

248
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,000
May must really trust you.

249
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
She invested millions because of you.

250
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,480
Right now, whatever you want to do,

251
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,000
she'll sign the papers without a second thought.

252
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,080
She loves me.

253
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:24,560
What if she finds out you were never cheated,

254
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,560
that you lied to her for money?

255
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,360
Do you think she’ll still love you if she finds out?

256
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,640
I can’t help it.

257
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,560
- I have my reasons. - All you have are excuses.

258
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,120
May.

259
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,440
Yes?

260
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,000
You still haven’t showered?

261
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,760
I don’t want to shower alone.

262
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,880
Want to join me?

263
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,440
Let’s shower together.

264
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,520
Krit.

265
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,600
Krit, I can walk there myself.

266
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,640
No, I’ll carry you.

267
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,840
Krit.

268
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,360
Come on, Krit.

269
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,160
Have you done this with anyone?

270
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,040
Because of love,

271
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,880
I decided to overlook the fact that he wasn’t honest about money.

272
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,160
I believed he must’ve really needed it,

273
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,720
and that it wasn’t anything more than that.

274
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,040
I’ve chosen the man I love,

275
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,360
so I must choose to trust him. Right, Aoy and Chod?

276
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,680
I chose to stay with him,

277
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,880
the man I love and am happy with.

278
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,240
That you lied to her for money?

279
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,320
Do you think she’ll still love you if she finds out?

280
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,640
I can't help it.

281
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,760
I have my reasons.

282
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,080
All you have are excuses.

283
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
May.

284
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,680
Nop.

285
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,640
Be careful with what you’re about to do.

286
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,880
Don’t ask me questions. Just do as I say,

287
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,920
or I’m doomed.

288
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,880
Are you heading to the office?

289
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,720
Yes.

290
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,880
I want to talk to you about something.

291
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,520
I told you that my friend cheated me out of money,

292
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,000
but it was actually a misunderstanding.

293
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,320
He didn’t do it.

294
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,840
He thought the money was his.

295
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,840
I was so drunk, I don’t even know what I said.

296
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,560
Someone might’ve misunderstood my intentions

297
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,160
and thought I was trying to scam you.

298
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,200
I don’t even know how to explain it to them.

299
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,160
But...

300
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,520
I want you to know

301
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,080
that I didn’t scam you.

302
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,120
The money you gave me

303
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,920
will be used to manage cash flow in the bar.

304
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,600
I’ll return it to you as soon as possible.

305
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,720
It's fine, Krit.

306
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,880
You can do whatever you want with that money.

307
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,240
I really just want to help.

308
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,520
Thank you.

309
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,760
Thank you so much, May.

310
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,520
You're welcome.

311
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,600
- See you at the bar. - Sure.

312
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,840
Yes.

313
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,800
You've checked in?

314
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,480
Okay, see you.

315
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,680
Hello, May.

316
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,280
Pat.

317
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,320
I have something to tell you about Krit.

318
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,720
Did you find out something?

319
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,200
It’s nothing.

320
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,280
He’s a good person.

321
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,360
That’s not true.

322
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,520
I don’t believe it.

323
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,440
I know him well.

324
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,840
Pat.

325
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,400
You don’t have to take care of me anymore.

326
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,120
Go start over with your life

327
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,240
without me.

328
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,960
I want to see you happy.

329
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,040
And...

330
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,120
I’m going to start over with my life too.

331
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,680
But if you’re worried about me,

332
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,000
I want you to know that I’m happy.

333
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,960
Don’t worry about me.

334
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,800
I have to go now, Pat.

335
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,200
May.

336
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,080
I just arrived. I'm walking to the bar.

337
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,640
See you.

338
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,279
So, the bar's counter will be here.

339
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,879
This slide shows some great spots to take photos.

340
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,640
And this is the DJ booth.

341
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,760
Here’s the design for the Halloween party.

342
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,520
Great, it's interesting.

343
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,439
- Let’s go with this. - Sure.

344
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,280
I want everyone to try the drinks

345
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,840
and pick the one that’s most suitable for the party.

346
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,480
Try them,

347
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,040
and then we’ll comment and decide afterward.

348
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,400
Okay.

349
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,280
Please excuse me.

350
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,200
Sexy May, the accounting team needs Krit's ID card again.

351
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,080
All done.

352
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,480
I'll prepare the documents outside.

353
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,440
Are you heading back to the office?

354
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,480
Yes.

355
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,840
What about you?

356
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:58,160
I’ll be here. My friend’s bringing a new client over for a meeting.

357
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,440
It might take a while.

358
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,800
Don’t wait up.

359
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,080
See you at home.

360
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,880
Sure, see you.

361
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,240
Okay.

362
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,680
Krit.

363
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,640
Are you done with work?

364
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,640
Yes, I'll go home soon.

365
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,880
Are you at the bar?

366
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,400
Yes.

367
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,000
Get home safely. See you at home.

368
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,680
I'm bored, Krit.

369
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,440
Can I wait for you at the bar?

370
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,560
Well...

371
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,560
My friend's bringing a new client over for a meeting.

372
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,639
Maybe next time,

373
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,440
when it's just me and my friends.

374
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,480
Sure.

375
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,920
I'll wait for you at home.

376
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,600
Okay, see you.

377
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,080
I won again.

378
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,280
- Let's go. - Let's do it again.

379
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,120
Let's go.

380
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,680
You're horrible.

381
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,200
May helped you because she felt sorry you got scammed.

382
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,480
But you’re gambling her money away.

383
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,960
So what? I just got another five million.

384
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,320
That makes it ten million in total

385
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,200
from my beloved May.

386
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,760
Wow.

387
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,320
Is she really that rich?

388
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,880
I don’t think so.

389
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,480
How much more does she have to spend on you?

390
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,040
That’s not all I want.

391
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,520
The power of attorney she signed for me...

392
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,200
I can do a lot with that.

393
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,800
If one day she finds out

394
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,200
and ends up in debt, it’ll be too late.

395
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,800
I’ll have someone take over her company and sell it off cheap.

396
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:57,400
And if she finds out you were the one who set this whole scam up,

397
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,120
what are you going to do?

398
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,480
I’ll tell her

399
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,800
that I got scammed too.

400
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,760
She won’t say anything

401
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,960
because she loves me.

402
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,320
She loves you, yet you’re doing all this just because you hate her ex.

403
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,720
You are...

404
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,240
so ruthless.

405
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,440
Watch your mouth.

406
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,440
I won, see that?

407
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,840
I’m really sorry, but I can’t give you an extra key card.

408
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,560
If you can’t reach Krit, I can call him for you.

409
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,640
It's fine.

410
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,320
- I’ll call him, thank you. - No problem.

411
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,480
May.

412
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,880
What are you doing here?

413
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,919
I was just asking the hotel staff for some information.

414
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,400
I need to send it to a client.

415
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,160
Are you done with your meeting?

416
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,319
Not yet. I just came down to grab something from the car.

417
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,520
I saw you, so I walked over.

418
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,120
I’m heading back up.

419
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,640
Would you like to join?

420
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,640
You’ve met all my friends already.

421
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,640
But it’s just the guys.

422
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,640
If you don’t mind, come join me.

423
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,200
It’s fine.

424
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,440
I don’t want to bother you. Go back to your meeting, I’ll head home.

425
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,120
See you at home.

426
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,560
Okay.

427
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,080
You said this is the last round.

428
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,040
Triple queen.

429
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,880
Ten thousand baht each, pay up.

430
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,680
I got seven, yet I lost again.

431
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,680
Wow.

432
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,520
Let's go home.

433
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,640
Okay.

434
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,640
Cheers.

435
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,200
Buy me food.

436
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,560
Bottoms up.

437
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,320
Come on. If you're broke, go home.

438
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,920
See you at the next match.

439
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,200
Next match? I’m broke.

440
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,879
- See you. - See you.

441
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,880
Get home safely.

442
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,760
Hey.

443
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,800
Yes.

444
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,720
You've checked in?

445
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Okay, see you.

446
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,200
May.

447
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,080
I just arrived. I'm walking to the bar.

448
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,600
See you.

449
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,880
I waited for so long. I’ve missed you.

450
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,000
You flew here without telling me.

451
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,480
I promised to play cards with my friends. I’m sorry.

452
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,440
It's okay.

453
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,600
I wanted to surprise you.

454
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,160
And...

455
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,240
What about that woman?

456
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,120
It’s fine.

457
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,680
I told her I had a meeting with a client.

458
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,280
Pim.

459
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,800
- Daddy. - Yes?

460
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,640
Are you still up, Pim?

461
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,040
I heard your voice and got excited, so I came out to see you.

462
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,680
How have you been? Did you miss me?

463
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,840
Give me a big hug.

464
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,760
Kiss me on the cheek.

465
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
One more time.

466
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,080
Come on, let's go in.

467
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,680
Let's go.

468
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,760
You’re up late tonight.

469
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,440
Really late.

470
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,880
No matter how hard you try to lie to yourself,

471
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,680
the truth will always come out.

472
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,440
Just wait a little longer.

473
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,800
Once I have the money to settle everything,

474
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,080
you,

475
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,480
our child,

476
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,960
and I

477
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,640
will finally get to start a happy new life.

478
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,120
Wait.

479
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,880
I know who you are.

480
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,280
I know who you are too.

481
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,120
(Power of Attorney)

482
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,040
May.

483
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,280
Did you find out something?

484
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,440
It's nothing. He's a good person.

485
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,160
That's not true. I don't believe it.

486
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,520
Walk here and then hide.

487
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,039
Walk past this.

488
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,439
I can't see him.

489
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,799
- I show up again. - He goes to another room.

490
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,599
You see a woman

491
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,080
and a child there.

492
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,120
What about that woman?

493
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,280
She's there.

494
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,360
She's watching us.

495
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,360
There.

496
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,480
She's watching us.
