1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,040
(This drama is based on
a true story.)

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,040
(The plot was adjusted
for entertainment purposes only.)

3
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,040
(We have no intention
to offend any careers,)

4
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,040
(encourage immoral sexual values,)

5
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,040
(or create a pessimistic disposition
of a gender or a group of people.)

6
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,840
(We would like to apologize in
advance for any misunderstandings.)

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,400
(Presents)

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,080
(Theory of Love)

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,640
We wish you happiness.

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,840
What are you doing here?

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,080
The day you moved out
and Krit was waiting for you.

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,720
He saw me,

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,480
and the look in his eyes
wasn’t trustworthy.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,240
That you lied to her for money?

15
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,880
Do you think she’ll still love you
if she finds out?

16
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,480
I'll get going.

17
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,960
Krit.

18
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,240
Hey.

19
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,000
It won’t be for long, right?

20
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,160
That we have to keep
hiding like this?

21
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,000
Pim’s growing up so fast.

22
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,320
Our child should be able to tell
everyone that she has a father.

23
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,320
It breaks my heart.

24
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,440
If I hadn’t mismanaged the company,

25
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,120
you wouldn’t have
to do things like this.

26
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,280
It's okay, Prae.

27
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,240
Hang in there a little longer.

28
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,280
Once I have the money
to settle everything,

29
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,040
you, our child, and I

30
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,360
will finally get
to start a happy new life.

31
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,960
I love you.

32
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,320
I love you too.

33
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,920
- I have to go.
- Okay.

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,440
May.

35
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,440
Why are you sitting in the dark?

36
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,120
I’m just a little stressed out
about work.

37
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,000
Are you done with your meeting?

38
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,760
Yes.

39
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,480
But I told you I’d be home late.

40
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,080
I'm sorry

41
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,400
for making you wait so long.

42
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,280
Aoy and Chod.

43
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,320
I’m really not sure how I feel,

44
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,080
but I still choose to believe

45
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,120
that he has his reasons for lying.

46
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,480
Do you need to go to the office
early tomorrow?

47
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,880
If not,

48
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,120
I want to take you somewhere.

49
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,000
There’s something
I need to tell you.

50
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,520
That’s my ex

51
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,040
and my daughter.

52
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,240
I’ve been meaning to tell you
for a long time,

53
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,640
but I just didn’t know how to start.

54
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,120
Things between us

55
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,520
ended a long time ago,
but we still see each other

56
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,360
because of our child.

57
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,120
Pim's still young.

58
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,320
She still doesn't understand.

59
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,400
So we have to pretend

60
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,440
we’re still in love.

61
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,280
That’s why we still meet.

62
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,680
Daddy.

63
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,400
- You're here.
- Pim.

64
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,120
How have you been?

65
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,280
Come on, let's go inside.

66
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
Let's go to bed.

67
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,920
You’re up late tonight.

68
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,560
I just saw your text.

69
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,200
So you’re saying May saw me
and knows about my wife?

70
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,200
Yes, I’ve been
calling and texting you.

71
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,720
But you were busy doing her.

72
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,920
Who knows where May ran off to now?

73
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,360
You need to change your plans
right now.

74
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,800
Break up with your wife,

75
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,680
and get serious with May

76
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,840
before everything falls apart.

77
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
May.

78
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,000
May.

79
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,520
After my meeting last night,

80
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,440
my ex texted me saying

81
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,520
our daughter wanted to see me

82
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,040
and that she missed me.

83
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,480
So I went to see her

84
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,200
and spent some time with her.

85
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,120
I’m sorry
I never told you about them.

86
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,280
May, please listen to me.

87
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,600
Is there anything else
you’re not telling me?

88
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,960
Fine.

89
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,000
After my meeting last night,

90
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,160
I played cards with my friends.

91
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,160
I admit I like to gamble,

92
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,840
but I’ve been trying to quit.

93
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,480
I couldn’t say no last night
because all my friends came over.

94
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,480
But I never used your money
to gamble.

95
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,720
I divided your money
into different parts.

96
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,040
One for the bar,

97
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,720
and one...

98
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,800
for my child.

99
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,720
I’m going through so much right now

100
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,120
because of my old debts.

101
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,600
I’m sorry I never told you
about any of this.

102
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,640
Believe me.

103
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,720
I don’t know if I can believe you.

104
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,320
I know you,

105
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,720
but it feels like
I don’t know you at all.

106
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,320
Can I really believe you?

107
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,280
Of course you can.

108
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,400
You’re all I have left.

109
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,640
Without you,

110
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,400
I have nothing.

111
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,800
I’ll have to close my bar,

112
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,880
my friends will disappear,

113
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,000
and my ex will run away
with my child.

114
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,520
Please give me another chance.

115
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,880
If you’re still mad about Prae,

116
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,240
I’m telling you I don’t love her.

117
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,280
I just made a mistake,

118
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,800
getting her pregnant.

119
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,720
But once I get everything settled,

120
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,320
I’m going to propose to you.

121
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,320
May.

122
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
This is the ring.

123
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,960
The ring I’ll propose to you with.

124
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,280
Please give me another chance.

125
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,120
Please marry me.

126
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,840
I need to be alone.

127
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,600
May.

128
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,440
Pim's still young.

129
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,280
She still doesn't understand.

130
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,200
So we have to pretend

131
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,400
we're still in love.

132
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,040
That’s why we still meet.

133
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,400
Krit’s not a bad person.

134
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,720
I know what you’re thinking,

135
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,440
but please don’t think badly of him.

136
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,840
I know you’ll never believe me,

137
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,760
but please, May.

138
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,120
I’m really suspicious about this.

139
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,320
I don’t want anything bad
to happen to you.

140
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,480
Please believe me.

141
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,000
I truly wish you well.

142
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,640
I don’t have any hidden agenda.

143
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,760
I’m just worried about you,

144
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,720
and I always will be.

145
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,480
I want to warn you.

146
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,240
If you plan to invest in this bar,
check everything carefully.

147
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,680
My friend dropped by
with the documents to sign.

148
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,080
The bar contract
we talked about the other day.

149
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,720
The accounting team is waiting
on them, so he stopped by.

150
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,000
Okay, I’ll sign them quickly.

151
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,200
(Power of Attorney)

152
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,520
I’m glad

153
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,720
you’re still here.

154
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,240
I haven’t called

155
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,720
because I wanted to give you
some time alone.

156
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,400
I still believe

157
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,480
that you’ll understand me.

158
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,480
I’ve been thinking it over.

159
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,400
I understand you.

160
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,840
You didn’t mean to lie to me.

161
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,000
You’ve just been under
so much stress,

162
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,320
so you didn’t know

163
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,320
how to tell me.

164
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,640
Under these circumstances,

165
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,920
it’s only right for me
to stay by your side.

166
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,560
Thank you

167
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,120
for understanding.

168
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,560
Sometimes life is like
a masquerade party, Aoy and Chod.

169
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,280
We never really know

170
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,480
what someone who acts happy
is hiding underneath.

171
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,640
Like someone who says they love you.

172
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,360
Do they really love you,

173
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,320
or is there deceit
behind their words?

174
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,720
Boo!

175
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,080
Krit, you really scared me.

176
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,360
Aren’t you afraid of me?

177
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,160
No.

178
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,000
Come on, let’s take a selfie.

179
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,280
Our bar's first themed party.

180
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,960
- I’ll send it to you right now.
- Okay.

181
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,320
All the guests
are having so much fun.

182
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,280
You did so well.

183
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,960
Our bar’s going to go viral.
We’ll have more people coming in.

184
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,040
Thank you, May.

185
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,040
I couldn’t have done this
without you.

186
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,160
I'm so lucky.

187
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,800
Krit.

188
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,560
Let’s talk outside.

189
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,520
I'll be right back.

190
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,960
Okay.

191
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,840
What’s the emergency?
You’re really interrupting me.

192
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,480
I just found our new target.

193
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,240
A new widow.

194
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,800
I think she owns a shipping company.

195
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,440
Her business looks
much better than May’s.

196
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,160
But I’m still busy with May.

197
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,800
Let someone else handle that.

198
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,480
I think she’d like someone like you.

199
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,760
Fine, give me some time.

200
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,960
I just cleared things up with May
about Prae.

201
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,880
I don’t want anyone else getting
involved and messing things up.

202
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,080
Fine.

203
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,040
In case you change your mind.

204
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,760
I left the new target’s documents
in your office.

205
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,560
Let’s go back in.

206
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,520
Plenty of beautiful, rich women
ready to take advantage of.

207
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,600
Cool, let's go.

208
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,920
Sure, please wait. I’ll send
the documents over right away.

209
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,320
Okay.

210
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,760
It’s late.
Are you still discussing work?

211
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,440
Yes.

212
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,320
Are you tired?

213
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,760
I’m exhausted.

214
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,480
I need a little moral support.

215
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,600
I love it when you act like this.

216
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,680
Stop working
and let’s have some fun.

217
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,920
Hold on, Krit.

218
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,760
I need to work a little longer.
I’ll join you soon.

219
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,320
Okay, hurry up.

220
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,600
Okay.

221
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,360
Who’s the new target?

222
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,920
That one?

223
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,280
Did you get her number?

224
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,720
Of course I did.

225
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,640
Wait.

226
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,960
I left my phone in the room.

227
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,320
Give me the keycard.

228
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,880
Wait.

229
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,760
Where is it?

230
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,920
I probably dropped it.

231
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,840
Ask for a new one at reception.

232
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,320
Darn it.

233
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,880
(Basic Information
of Potential Targets)

234
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,680
(Widow
Asset: 30-50 million baht)

235
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,920
(Maysa Warakul, Single
Asset: 30-40 million baht)

236
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,480
I found out that Krit approached me

237
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,480
because he saw
that I was doing well.

238
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,640
He intentionally got between
Pat and me to manipulate me.

239
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,400
Krit has never loved me,
Aoy and Chod.

240
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,080
What he and his friends did

241
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,120
was make a woman fall in love,

242
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,520
just to use her.

243
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,480
Even Prae,

244
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,880
the woman he had a child with,

245
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,560
was probably a target too.

246
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,440
(Krit)

247
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,360
Wait.

248
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,040
What is it?

249
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,960
I know the person staying here.

250
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,800
What were you doing inside?

251
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,520
I came to get something for Krit.

252
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,080
Please excuse me.

253
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,080
Hold on.

254
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,040
Let me call him

255
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,000
just to make sure
you got the right thing.

256
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
Wait.

257
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,880
I know who you are.

258
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,200
Krit would never let you in there.

259
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,840
I know who you are too.

260
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,920
You know what’s in this room.

261
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,920
You and Krit planned this together
to deceive me.

262
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,360
What do you mean?

263
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,320
I know everything about you.

264
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,920
You have a child with Krit.

265
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,760
She’s in that room.

266
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,720
Let me be crystal clear.
Don’t you dare mess with my child.

267
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,280
There are things
you don’t know too.

268
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,280
You’re also one of his victims.

269
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,960
He intentionally lied to you.

270
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,560
Believe me.

271
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,440
I don’t want you
or your child to get hurt.

272
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,680
He’s planning to dump you
and put all the blame on you.

273
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Let me tell you something.

274
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,440
Krit would never do that.

275
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,280
Because he loves me.

276
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,640
Then listen to this.

277
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,160
If you're still mad about Prae,

278
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,600
I’m telling you I don’t love her.

279
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,240
I just made a mistake,

280
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,120
getting her pregnant.

281
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,800
But once I get everything settled,

282
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,680
I’m going to propose to you.

283
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,800
You probably wondered
if he ever really loved you.

284
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,080
No, someone like Krit
loves no one but himself.

285
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,720
He made you fall in love with him,

286
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,000
made you do everything he wanted.

287
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,600
Just like he did with me,
and all the other women.

288
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,360
But I won’t let him do this
to anyone else.

289
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,560
What are you doing?

290
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,560
I need your help.

291
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,280
Print the documents I sent to you
via email.

292
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,920
Thank you all
for having fun with us tonight.

293
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,800
We had a great party,
thanks to Sexy May and her team.

294
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,040
She’s here, so please give her
a round of applause.

295
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,520
Thank you.

296
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,960
I have something for you.

297
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,320
Here you go.

298
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,000
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

299
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,240
On a special day like this,

300
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,200
I want to do something special.

301
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,000
It might seem a little strange
to do this at a Halloween party,

302
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,200
but I couldn’t wait
until Valentine’s Day.

303
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,000
When I’m sure about my feelings,

304
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I want to take action right away.

305
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,880
May.

306
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,800
I just hope

307
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,240
you won’t turn me down this time.

308
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,720
Marry me.

309
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,600
Krit.

310
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,800
Were you really planning to dump me?

311
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,920
You plan to marry her.

312
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,640
- What about me and our child?
- Hey.

313
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,000
Who are you? What do you want?

314
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,960
I see. Is this how
you’re going to act?

315
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,600
It's fine if you want to lie to
everyone and say you don’t know me.

316
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,520
But don’t think you’re the only one
who can lie.

317
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,040
This man is a con artist.

318
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,360
He used me,
and he’s using this woman too.

319
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,200
He’s going to swindle your money.

320
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,440
- Hey.
- You're a real jerk.

321
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,880
Who are you? What do you want?

322
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,480
Do you have any proof?
I can go to the police.

323
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,560
Where's the proof?

324
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,680
You never loved me.

325
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,760
Do you have any proof?

326
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,600
- What about our child?
- Your documents.

327
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,080
Do you have any proof?

328
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,400
Here’s the proof.

329
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,120
You made me sign the power
of attorney and used it freely.

330
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,880
You forged Prae's and my signatures
to deceive everyone too.

331
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,720
Here.

332
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,680
- Have a look, guys.
- May.

333
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,680
- Go ahead.
- Hear me out.

334
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,880
Listen to me, May.

335
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,720
Are you still going to let him
keep lying to you?

336
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,640
May. Listen to me.

337
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,240
Nop, say something.

338
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,960
Say something! You jerk!

339
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,360
No.

340
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,880
Listen to me, May.

341
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,200
- Listen to me. I can explain.
- Go ahead, May.

342
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,400
I’ll gather all the evidence
and go to the police.

343
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,200
See you in court.

344
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,360
May.

345
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,680
May.

346
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,880
- Krit.
- May.

347
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,240
Listen!

348
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,000
You never loved me,
but how could you lie to our child?

349
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,840
You’re terrible.
How could you do this?

350
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,440
- I paid for everything. Shut up.
- How could you do this to us?

351
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,440
You're horrible.

352
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,280
What's the matter with you?
Have you gone mad?

353
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,560
Have you gone mad?

354
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,640
I like you, May.

355
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,720
I love you.

356
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,680
Hey.

357
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,920
- Hey.
- Miss.

358
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,160
Hey.

359
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,800
Thank you.

360
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,600
Hello.

361
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,680
May.

362
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,320
I heard about you from your team.
How are you?

363
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,440
The owner of this phone
has passed out.

364
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,800
She won’t wake up.

365
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,960
Her head’s bleeding right now.

366
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,600
What? Where is she?

367
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,680
Can you call an ambulance for her?

368
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,080
Sure, I’ll do that.

369
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,560
Okay, thank you.

370
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,680
May.

371
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,080
May!

372
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,840
May!

373
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,240
May.

374
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,360
How is my girlfriend, Doctor?

375
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,080
The patient had a stroke.

376
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
How...

377
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,040
How is she now?

378
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,880
Luckily, she doesn’t need surgery,

379
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,240
but we need to monitor her closely.

380
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,200
Thank you.

381
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,520
Pat.

382
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,920
Pat.

383
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,200
May.

384
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,640
How are you?

385
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,680
Hold on.

386
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,760
I’ve called the nurse.

387
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,080
Are you all right?

388
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,680
She’s awake.

389
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,320
I’ll get the doctor right away.

390
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,320
It took some time
to regain parts of my memory.

391
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,800
I had to relearn
how to walk and talk

392
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,720
so I could get back to normal.

393
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,240
I’m lucky to have Pat by my side.

394
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,480
Being sick was a chance
for Pat to come back into my life.

395
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,200
I got better and better,

396
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:33,360
and after that,
I lived happily with Pat

397
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,560
as friends.

398
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,320
Pat also helped me talk
to the lawyer about Krit

399
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,280
and the creditors Krit borrowed from
using my name.

400
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,040
May.

401
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,560
Don't worry.

402
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,440
Everything will be okay.

403
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,560
I'll help you.

404
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,480
And everything went okay,
just like Pat said.

405
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,440
Krit had to pay for everything
he did to me and everyone else.

406
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,920
Pat gave me back my life.

407
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,920
May.

408
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,160
Have you taken your medicine?

409
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,800
If you have, then you should
go to bed.

410
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,000
You can’t stay up late
like you used to.

411
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,640
I’ve taken it.

412
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,000
You still have this photo?

413
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,880
Do you still remember it?

414
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,360
I'm sorry, Pat.

415
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,400
I’m sorry for how I treated you.

416
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,400
I'm really sorry.

417
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,160
It's okay.

418
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,520
All the bad things
are behind us now.

419
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,760
May.

420
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,200
Can we get back together

421
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,560
and be in love once again?

422
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,840
Let me take care of you again.

423
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,480
I love you.

424
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,840
Pat.

425
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,280
I...

426
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,800
I'm sorry.

427
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,240
Okay.

428
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,080
It's okay.

429
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,600
In the end, no matter how good
he was to me,

430
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,480
it couldn’t change
how I felt about him.

431
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,640
He did nothing wrong.

432
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,360
He just loved me,

433
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,560
but I didn’t love him.

434
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,280
Now I understand that using love

435
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,200
to hold someone back,

436
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,400
no matter the reason,

437
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,400
only causes pain to
the one who loves.

438
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,240
I'll help you.

439
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,480
- It's okay, Pat.
- Let me.

440
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,200
Thank you.

441
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,840
I'll get going now.

442
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,040
May.

443
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,920
I want you to remember.

444
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,640
No matter what happens,

445
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,880
I’ll always be here for you.

446
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,080
Thank you.

447
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,760
Thank you so much.

448
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,920
Good luck.

449
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:34,200
Some might say I’m stupid
for leaving a man who loves me.

450
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,640
But sometimes, love isn’t about
being smart or stupid.

451
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,600
It’s about being honest
with your feelings,

452
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,760
and being gentle with the other
person’s heart

453
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
by not hurting them anymore.

454
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,200
Choosing the person you love
isn’t always the right decision.

455
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:58,200
Sometimes, love driven only by
emotion can lead to disappointment.

456
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,880
May.

457
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
May.

458
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,080
Are you okay?

459
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
May.

460
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,880
I'll be back. May.

461
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,760
I told you

462
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,000
that I would take care of you.

463
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,040
I love you.

464
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,080
Choosing someone who loves you
when you don’t love them

465
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,320
can also lead to problems and pain.

466
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,840
So choose the person you love,
who loves you back.

467
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,680
So you can move forward together.

468
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,880
I hope you find that person, May.

469
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,000
Choosing between someone you love
and someone who loves you

470
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,760
isn’t as good as choosing someone
you love, who loves you back.

471
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,520
Are you Fon, the writer?

472
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,240
I really love your work.
I’ve read all your stories.

473
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,560
Do you know that girl?

474
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,320
Let me warn you.

475
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,600
She’s got a reputation
for sleeping around.

476
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,640
Don’t tell me
you’ve fallen for her.

477
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,640
I think everyone has their reasons.

478
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,720
Should we meet again?

479
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,480
What about my place

480
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,040
or your place?

481
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,440
Closer.

482
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,560
- Cut.
- Why don't we hug inside?

483
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,480
Why don't we hug inside?
Why are we hugging here?

484
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,880
I danced intensely.

485
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,240
I didn't drink.

486
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,520
She asked if I was okay.

487
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,760
Yes.

488
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,120
Show the ring.

489
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,760
No.

490
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,840
It's okay.
