1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,040
(This drama is based on
a true story.)

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,040
(The plot was adjusted
for entertainment purposes only.)

3
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,040
(We have no intention
to offend any careers,)

4
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,040
(encourage immoral sexual values,)

5
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,040
(or create a pessimistic disposition
of a gender or a group of people.)

6
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,840
(We would like to apologize in
advance for any misunderstandings.)

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,400
(Presents)

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,360
(Theory of Love)

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,680
I promise

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,240
I’ll take good care of you.

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,160
Surprise.

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,640
Krit.

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,640
I like you, May.

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,840
Leave me alone.

15
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,360
Do you realize

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,640
you’re making me
more and more uncomfortable, Pat?

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,560
Don’t worry about anything.

18
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,880
Forget everything.

19
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,520
Because this is your life, May.

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,840
Pat.

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,840
Can we postpone

22
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,760
our wedding?

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,000
Why?

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,760
Are you still mad at me?

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,240
I'm so sorry

26
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,760
for making you uncomfortable.

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,840
I'm not mad at you.

28
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,520
So why do you want to postpone it?
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,120
I’m stressing you out, aren’t I?

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,280
Last night,

32
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,840
I just did what I felt like doing.

33
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,000
You didn’t do anything wrong.

34
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,800
It’s my fault

35
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,720
for not being clear with Pat.

36
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,800
What do you mean?

37
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,320
It would've been great

38
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,920
if I’d chosen
to be with you back then.

39
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,440
Come on, May.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,080
Don’t say that.

41
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,280
You’re marrying Pat.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,600
Just forget

43
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,240
about last night.

44
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,080
If you still love him,

45
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,360
I want you

46
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,120
to go back to him.

47
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,880
But if you want me
to take responsibility,

48
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,920
I’d be happy to.

49
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,120
Can we not postpone the wedding?

50
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,480
I’ve been waiting for ages.

51
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,360
I’m so sorry for making you
uncomfortable.

52
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,560
I promise I’ll change.

53
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,400
We're just not compatible.

54
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,520
Are you breaking up with me again?

55
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,440
No.

56
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,960
I love you, May. I'm sorry.

57
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,480
I promise I’ll do better.
I’ll try to understand your work.

58
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,920
I won’t make you uncomfortable.

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,320
It’s not just that, Pat.

60
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
May, but...

61
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,120
Our wedding is coming up.

62
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,080
We’ve prepared almost everything.

63
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,200
The invitations are already out.
What are we going to tell them?

64
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,960
May, I love you.
Please don’t postpone it.

65
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,400
Please calm down.
Think about it, okay?

66
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,320
Aoy and Chod.

67
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,720
I’m too scared
to tell him the real reason.

68
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,360
I want to break up with him
because of Krit.

69
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,160
So I decided
to postpone my decision,

70
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,400
instead of the wedding.

71
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,440
Are you stressed?

72
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,480
No.

73
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,520
I'm just stressed about work.

74
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,760
If you're worried about meeting up

75
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,360
or upset about seeing me now,

76
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,840
just tell me.

77
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,880
Forget about work.

78
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,200
I’m willing to consult someone else.

79
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,600
It’s not like that.

80
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,760
Did you tell Pat

81
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,560
that I’m your client?

82
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,720
No, I didn’t.

83
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,520
Did you ever tell him

84
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,440
that I asked you

85
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,160
to be my girlfriend back then?

86
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,080
No, I didn’t.

87
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,640
Then...

88
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,640
there’s nothing to worry about.

89
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,560
No one will find out about us.

90
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,640
Pat would never suspect me.

91
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,240
Okay, Krit.

92
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,920
There’s one more thing

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,200
I wanted to talk to you about.

94
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,840
I want to ask you to be my partner
at the bar.

95
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,600
You’d just need to invest,
I’ll handle the rest.

96
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,760
You don’t have to do anything
but some marketing advice.

97
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,040
You’ve already done so much
for me for free.

98
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,440
So I thought you should get shares
and dividends as a reward.

99
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,920
Would you be interested?

100
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,840
That sounds interesting.

101
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,160
Thank you for trusting me.

102
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,440
Pat?

103
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,200
What are you doing here?

104
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,200
I’m applying for a job
at your company.

105
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,240
Instead of freelancing
for someone else,

106
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,600
I’ll help you.
So I'll understand the work better.

107
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,840
I don’t think that’s a good idea.

108
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,040
Why not?

109
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,960
Well...

110
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,320
It would be nice to have
Pat help out.

111
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,280
Krit.

112
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Hello.

113
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,240
Long time no see.

114
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,160
What are you doing here?

115
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,360
May’s helping with my bar’s
promotional plans.

116
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,200
I see.

117
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,600
Having Pat help would be great.

118
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,480
We might get
some good ideas from him.

119
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,760
May.

120
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,680
Thank you

121
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,240
for letting me help out.

122
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,080
I have something to tell you.

123
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,440
No matter what you do,

124
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,640
I’ll always support you.

125
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,760
I’m sorry

126
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,560
for making you feel like
I don’t care about your work.

127
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Thank you.

128
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,840
We haven’t
spent much time together lately.

129
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,560
Tonight...

130
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,320
you don’t have any urgent work,
do you?

131
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,880
Pat.

132
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,760
What's wrong?

133
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,960
Maybe next time.

134
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,680
I'm exhausted.

135
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,480
That’s not true.
You’ve been acting strange lately.

136
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,360
Are you getting bored with me?

137
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,560
I...

138
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,520
May.

139
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,240
Please.

140
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,040
Please, give me a chance
to make things right.

141
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,520
I love you so much.

142
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,520
Aoy and Chod, all I feel
for Pat right now is pity.

143
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,160
So I decided to buy some more time

144
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,880
before making a decision

145
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,160
in a way I never thought I could.

146
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,720
So, do you like it?

147
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
It’s nice.

148
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,080
You moving in

149
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,240
makes this house so much nicer.

150
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,960
Then we don’t need
to look for a new place.

151
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,480
Just me moving in
makes it feel perfect already.

152
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,280
May.

153
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,160
Once we get married,

154
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,680
do you want to have kids?

155
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,480
What about you?

156
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Of course I do.

157
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,080
I’m so jealous of my friends
with cute kids.

158
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,480
I really want one too.

159
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,880
If we’re going to have one,

160
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,880
would you want a son or a daughter?

161
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,160
It doesn't matter.

162
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,280
- Really?
- Yes.

163
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,240
Then...

164
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,320
What?

165
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,960
Should we start making one now?

166
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,400
What are you talking about?

167
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,720
Let’s make a baby.

168
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,240
- Pat.
- Where should we do it?

169
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,480
Hey.

170
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,080
- Right here.
- Hey!

171
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,560
Pat.

172
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,680
What?

173
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,840
- Hey.
- What?

174
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,960
Come on.

175
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,040
- We're going to make one now.
- No.

176
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,720
(Maple Forte
Emergency Contraceptive Tablet)

177
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,720
- May.
- Pat.

178
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,440
Do you want to go to the office now?

179
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,200
We’re working together,
so we should go together.

180
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,440
If you’re tired,
you can nap while I drive.

181
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,840
Let’s go separately.

182
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,760
I have to meet clients.
It’s more convenient that way.

183
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,440
Okay.

184
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,040
Sure.

185
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,720
I’ll go get ready.

186
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,160
Okay.

187
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,960
Emergency contraceptive tablet?

188
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,680
Good, a Halloween party
to help promote the bar.

189
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,680
That sounds really interesting.

190
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,760
That’s right.

191
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,400
It was actually Pat’s idea.

192
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,960
Really?

193
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,840
Pat.

194
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,480
I really like this idea.

195
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
Pat.

196
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,560
Pat.

197
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,200
- Yes?
- I said, I really like your idea.

198
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,680
A Halloween party
to promote the bar.

199
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,840
Great job.

200
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,360
Thank you.

201
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,440
But I’m really surprised.

202
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,560
You’re not a party person, are you?

203
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,440
I get it.

204
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,040
You were probably inspired
by Sexy May.

205
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,520
Oh.

206
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,120
Not really.

207
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,640
How about this?

208
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,040
I’d like to invite everyone
to my bar tonight,

209
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,560
so you can get to know it better.

210
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,720
Don’t worry, it’s on me.

211
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,600
Drink some, Pat.

212
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,720
Please, go ahead.
I don’t drink much.

213
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,400
He doesn’t drink.

214
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,040
He also doesn’t like parties.

215
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,120
At the last company party,

216
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,600
Pat came to bring May home.

217
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,440
Really?

218
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,160
Well...

219
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,400
I know May and I are very different.

220
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,160
It might even seem like
we're incompatible.

221
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,600
Sometimes I make her uncomfortable,

222
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,520
but I’m ready to change for her.

223
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,200
- It's fine, Pat.
- No, it's okay.

224
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,280
Krit.

225
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,120
Cheers.

226
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,520
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

227
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,800
- More.
- More.

228
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,120
Cheers.

229
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,840
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

230
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,200
- More.
- Cheers.

231
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,200
Cheers.

232
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,960
Bottoms up.

233
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,640
That's enough, Pat.

234
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,840
Go ahead, Pat.

235
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,920
Are you okay?

236
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,440
I need to use the bathroom.

237
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,600
- I’ll check up on him.
- No, I’ll go.

238
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,960
Oh no, Pat! Are you okay?

239
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,600
Why did you do that?

240
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,680
Let me help.

241
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,400
I just wanted
to adjust myself to you.

242
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,680
I don’t want you to get bored.

243
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,880
You know I love you
and I want to marry you.

244
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,120
I want to start a family with you

245
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
and have kids with you.

246
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,280
Do you still want to marry me?

247
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,800
Why are you asking me that?

248
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,080
Are you okay?

249
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,200
You’ve been acting strange
since this morning.

250
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,960
I saw it.

251
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,520
The box of the contraceptive tablet
you took.

252
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,800
Don’t you want to have kids
with me anymore?

253
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,520
Do you not want
to marry me anymore?

254
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,560
Tell me.

255
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,120
- May.
- Pat.

256
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,920
Let’s not talk about this now.
Let’s go home.

257
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,720
Come on. Let me help.

258
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,160
- I'll help.
- Thank you.

259
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,480
Pat.

260
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,600
Let's go, Pat.

261
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,120
He’s trying hard to change for you,

262
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,720
but sometimes it feels like

263
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,120
he’s forcing it.

264
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,080
I was the same way.

265
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,720
I tried to change for an ex,
but it didn’t work out.

266
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,280
Maybe it could work for you two.

267
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,600
But if it really doesn’t work,

268
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,560
I want you to think carefully.

269
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,080
Marriage

270
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,080
is a big deal.

271
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,400
If you decide to marry him,

272
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,320
you’ll have to live
with him forever.

273
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,280
The more I talk,

274
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,440
the more I’m stressing you out.

275
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
I'm sorry.

276
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,680
No matter what happens,

277
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,640
I’ll be here.

278
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,160
You can always call me
and talk to me

279
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,760
about anything that’s bothering you.

280
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,360
Thank you.

281
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,280
May.

282
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,560
Thank you.

283
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,680
And...

284
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,720
I'm sorry.

285
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,840
I won’t pressure you again.

286
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,240
If you’re not ready to have a kid,

287
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,000
we can wait until you are.

288
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,200
Don’t change for me,

289
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,080
because I’ll change for you.

290
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,440
Can you stay with me for a while?

291
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,200
We don’t get to do this often.

292
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,320
You’re always so busy.

293
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,880
Here, Krit.

294
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,040
Power of attorney documents
and the check for five million baht.

295
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,600
(Signature: Maysa)

296
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,400
Thank you for trusting me.

297
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,920
Does Pat know
you’re going to be my partner?

298
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,960
I didn’t tell him.

299
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,320
We don’t see eye to eye on things.

300
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,480
If I tell him and he disagrees,
we’ll just end up fighting.

301
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,120
Okay.

302
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,200
I'm glad we're partners.

303
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,680
Likewise.

304
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,760
- Hey.
- Hello.

305
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,360
Pat.

306
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,720
Are you okay?

307
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,280
Yes.

308
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,080
I had a great caretaker last night.

309
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,960
I'm jealous.

310
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,200
I’m here to say that
the script for your video is done.

311
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,960
I sent you an email.

312
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,680
Take a look
and let me know if anything’s off.

313
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,480
It's fine.

314
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,920
I trust you.

315
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,920
May’s taking care of it too,
so I’m not worried.

316
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,680
Let's get started then.

317
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,280
We’ve got a special drink
for you tonight.

318
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,160
Sexy May will be joining us as well.

319
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,800
This drink is really fiery.

320
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,560
It’s called the Flaming Lamborghini.

321
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,880
Let’s see what’s hotter,

322
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,000
the drink or Sexy May.

323
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,760
Let's get started.

324
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,160
Please put this over there.

325
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,840
This glass.

326
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,480
And...

327
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,960
Then this one.

328
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,960
No.

329
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,360
Flip it.

330
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,200
Like this.

331
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,440
That's right.

332
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,240
Then this one.

333
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,040
That's right. Flip it over.
And then...

334
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,400
Flip this one too.
Yes, just like that.

335
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,640
And the last step.

336
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,960
This step is really important

337
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,400
because it’ll make our drink

338
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,600
even more fiery.

339
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,240
I’m sure

340
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,840
Sexy May will like this

341
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,880
because

342
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,720
she likes to play with fire.

343
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,120
Am I right?

344
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,640
May!

345
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,920
Pat, fire!

346
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
Pat. Are you okay?

347
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,120
Call an ambulance.

348
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,040
Pat, put out the fire.

349
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,640
Are you okay?

350
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,920
You shouldn’t have done that.

351
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,920
Come on.

352
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,400
If I hadn’t, you would’ve been hurt.

353
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,160
Thank you.

354
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,680
You don’t have to thank me.

355
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,680
It’s my job to protect you.

356
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,160
(Krit)

357
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,520
Who's calling you?

358
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,560
Is it about work?

359
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,400
Take it.

360
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,400
Hello, Krit.

361
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,440
How's Pat?

362
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,960
Pat?

363
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,880
He's better now.

364
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,440
I called because I wanted
to ask you something.

365
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,160
I’m meeting a friend
I want you to meet.

366
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,080
Are you free to come?

367
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,040
It’s fine if not. I understand

368
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,000
if you need to take care of Pat.

369
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,720
Tonight?

370
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,840
I...

371
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,480
Is this the appointment
you told me about?

372
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,920
It’s fine. You should go.

373
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,920
Don’t worry, I’m much better now.

374
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,040
Okay, Krit. I’ll see you soon.

375
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,280
Okay, see you.

376
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,440
I’m glad we're partners,
Sexy May.

377
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,920
You’re even more beautiful
than Krit described.

378
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,640
We’re planning to expand soon.

379
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,360
If you’re interested,

380
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,840
we’d be happy to welcome
someone as brilliant as you.

381
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,960
Thank you.

382
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,480
I’ll have to think about it.

383
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,800
You and Krit
look like you’d make a great match.

384
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,520
Nonsense.

385
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,440
She's my junior.

386
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,280
Also...

387
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,000
She's getting married soon.

388
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,520
Really?

389
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,480
What a shame for Krit.

390
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,800
He really likes you.

391
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,400
He talks about you all the time.

392
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,560
Stop it, you’re talking too much.

393
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,800
Drink up.

394
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,000
(11:50 pm)

395
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,720
Please excuse me.

396
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,240
Is everything okay?

397
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,200
Did Pat call you?

398
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,920
He didn’t call me at all.

399
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,000
I think he’s really trying to change
for me.

400
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,440
Like I said,

401
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,600
changing who you are
means forcing it.

402
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,720
How long can he keep that up?

403
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,760
I feel guilty.

404
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,800
I shouldn’t be here.

405
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,240
May.

406
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,360
Don't overthink it.

407
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,600
You’ve done nothing wrong.

408
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,040
Krit, I think that

409
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,720
we shouldn’t meet for now.

410
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,120
Why not?

411
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,240
We’re meeting for work,
we’re partners.

412
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,760
My friend and I discussed
expanding the business.

413
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,960
I want you as our partner.

414
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,080
Thank you.

415
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,040
But I'm not ready.

416
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,960
I’ll only be a partner at this bar.

417
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,120
Let me think about it.

418
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,040
I’ll get going.

419
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,040
Please apologize to
your friend for me.

420
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,800
Okay, no problem.

421
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,840
May.

422
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,280
You're home.

423
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Pat.

424
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,840
It's late. Why are you still up?

425
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,680
I’m cleaning up my wound.

426
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,880
Thank you.

427
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,120
Are you okay?

428
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,960
I'm sorry.

429
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,640
Wait. Hey.

430
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,640
For what?

431
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,120
For leaving me alone at home?

432
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,600
May, I'm used to it. It's okay.

433
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,160
I was just cleaning up my wound.

434
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,360
I was a bit clumsy but I made it.

435
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,440
Come here.

436
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,040
Thank you.

437
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,880
Okay?

438
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,080
(Krit)

439
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,320
Hello.

440
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,320
How are you? Are you home?

441
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,920
I'm worried about you.

442
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,440
Krit, this is me. Pat.

443
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,040
Hey.

444
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,560
Did I call you by mistake?

445
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,320
Where's May?

446
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,040
She's in the shower.

447
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,880
What is it?

448
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,160
She left her phone outside.

449
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,960
Do you want to leave a message?

450
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,360
No, it's fine.

451
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,200
I'll talk to her later.

452
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,800
Don't tell her
I called you by mistake.

453
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,440
- Okay.
- Thanks.

454
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,600
Don't overthink about us.
Good night.

455
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,360
Thank you.

456
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,720
May.

457
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,920
I thought you were asleep.

458
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,080
Was it work?

459
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,680
Yes.

460
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,480
Where were you?

461
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,480
I was looking
at the video from Krit's bar.

462
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,680
May.

463
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,240
What is it?

464
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,400
Nothing.

465
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,280
I have to go out of town for work.

466
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,720
There’s an old project
I need to help a client with.

467
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,160
Sure.

468
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:11,120
There’s nothing
you can do at the office right now.

469
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,400
Don't worry.

470
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,640
But I’ll be coming home late
these days.

471
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,960
I have to prepare for a pitch
for a new client.

472
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,400
It’s late.
You should get some sleep.

473
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,320
Don’t respond
to unimportant messages.

474
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,200
Okay.

475
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,440
- Good night.
- Night.

476
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,720
May.

477
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,120
- Yes?
- Are you sick again?

478
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,040
I'm fine.

479
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,440
I’m just dizzy
and have a runny nose. I’ll be fine.

480
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,880
You went to bed late, that’s why
your immune system is down.

481
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,880
Your body isn’t in the best shape
right now.

482
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,360
If work isn’t too important today,

483
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,200
take a sick day and rest.

484
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,400
You said you were in a hurry.

485
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,840
You should go, or you’ll be late.

486
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,440
Right.

487
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,400
I’ll come back as soon as I’m done.

488
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,240
You said you were going to spend
the night there.

489
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,840
Why would you drive home
after a long day? It’s dangerous.

490
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,720
Pat, take care of yourself.
Don’t worry about me too much.

491
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,920
Okay.

492
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,920
- I'll get going then.
- Okay.

493
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,880
Get well soon.

494
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,320
Have a safe trip.

495
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Hello.

496
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,600
How's the office?

497
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,520
Nothing to report here.

498
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,000
I’m calling about Krit.

499
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,840
What about him?

500
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,400
He’s been waiting for you
at the office for a while.

501
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,760
He asked me where you were

502
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,920
because you wouldn’t
answer his calls.

503
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,440
I’m actually a little sick.

504
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,600
Please tell him I won’t be going in.

505
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,000
I’ll review the work online.

506
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,440
Okay.

507
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,160
Thanks.

508
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,680
Were you able to reach her?

509
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,640
Yes, she’s a little sick.

510
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,320
So she didn’t answer your call.

511
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,800
She won’t be coming in.

512
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,880
She’ll probably call you later.

513
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,800
What about Pat?

514
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,840
Pat’s out of town for work.
He’ll be back tomorrow.

515
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,560
Please excuse me.

516
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,240
Krit.

517
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,040
Krit.

518
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,920
Didn’t I text you saying I’m sick?

519
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,320
That’s why
I didn’t answer your call.

520
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,880
Really?

521
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,000
Why do I feel like
you’re avoiding me?

522
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,320
Why would I avoid you?

523
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,840
Do you feel better now?

524
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,080
Yes.

525
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,880
I’ll get some more rest, and I’ll
see you at the office tomorrow.

526
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,960
Thank you for worrying about me.

527
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,400
Wait.

528
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,800
What is it?

529
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,800
Well...

530
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,680
I got cheated by a friend.

531
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,680
I didn’t think this would happen
because I trusted him.

532
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,720
He took millions.

533
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,440
Really?

534
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,600
Have you filed a police report?

535
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,880
There’s no point.

536
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,040
I don’t have any proof.
The police wouldn’t believe me.

537
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,920
What are you going to do then?

538
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,240
I’ll shut down the bar

539
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,520
and move back overseas.

540
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,040
But you started this bar
from scratch.

541
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,440
Are you just going to give up?

542
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,560
You love this bar, don’t you?

543
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,800
I do.

544
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,000
I love this bar
because I've got my friend...

545
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,920
and I've got you.

546
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,600
But now I have no one left.

547
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,800
You probably don’t want
to be involved anymore.

548
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,200
You’re going to leave me
to marry Pat.

549
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,240
I have no one.

550
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,680
I’ll try to sell the bar

551
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,760
and return your money.

552
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,840
Don’t worry about the money.

553
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,600
I want you to fight for your bar.

554
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,440
If I had you,

555
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,840
I’d be ready to fight.

556
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,840
- Krit, please don't do this.
- May.

557
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,320
- Krit.
- I love you.

558
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,320
- Stop, Krit.
- I’ve always loved you. May.

559
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,400
Krit.

560
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,960
- I love you.
- Don't.

561
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,120
I know you love me too.

562
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,240
- May.
- Krit.

563
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,320
Krit.

564
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,280
You should go. Let's talk later.

565
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,640
Pat.

566
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,000
How are you? What are you doing?

567
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,240
I just arrived at the hotel.

568
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,440
I’m going to shower and go to bed,
so I’m calling you first.

569
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,680
How are you?

570
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,200
Krit knows I’m sick,
so he dropped by.

571
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,000
We’re talking in front of the house.

572
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,120
Krit, it's Pat.

573
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,600
Pat.

574
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,480
Come home
and take care of your girlfriend.

575
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,960
Don’t leave her alone for long.

576
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,160
Pat.

577
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,640
After Krit leaves, I’ll go to bed.
You should too.

578
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,120
See you tomorrow.

579
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Okay.

580
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,640
You should go, Krit.
I’m begging you. Don’t do this.

581
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,960
Thank you for always caring
about me.

582
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,440
But I think
we should just stay friends.

583
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,840
As for your bar,

584
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,240
if you need my help,

585
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,440
I’ll do what I can.

586
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,520
Okay.

587
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,800
Krit.

588
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,320
Love isn’t about charity.

589
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:08,000
And pity alone can’t make it last.

590
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,880
You still haven’t come home.

591
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,480
I can’t let you have all the fun.

592
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,440
You’re keeping a secret from me,
aren’t you?

593
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Tell me.

594
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,800
Pat.

595
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,920
Let's break up.

596
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,520
Please, give me a chance
to make things right.

597
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
- Cut.
- Cut.

598
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,640
- Sorry.
- A slate for your camera.

599
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,680
Cut.

600
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,120
- Pat.
- What?

601
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,400
- Hey.
- Okay.

602
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,480
Cut.

603
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,920
Oh no.

604
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,600
Set.

605
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,840
And action!

606
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,880
May.

607
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,000
I'm sorry. I tripped over the rug.
