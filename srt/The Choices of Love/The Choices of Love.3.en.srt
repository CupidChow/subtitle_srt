(This drama is based on
a true story.)

00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,040
(The plot was adjusted
for entertainment purposes only.)

(We have no intention
to offend any careers)

(or create a pessimistic disposition
of a gender or a group of people.)

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,840
(We would like to apologize in
advance for any misunderstandings.)

(Theory of Love)

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,800
What are you doing here?

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,800
I’m applying for a job
at your company.

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,480
It’s nice to have Pat help out.

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,080
I'm glad we're partners.

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,160
Likewise.

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,680
Hello.

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,120
I'm worried about you.

16
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,200
Don't overthink about us.
Good night.

17
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,640
You said you were in a hurry.

18
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,120
You should go, or you’ll be late.

19
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,120
I’ll come back as soon as I’m done.

20
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,120
You said you were going to spend
the night there.

21
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,680
Why would you drive home
after a long day? It’s dangerous.

22
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,640
Krit.

23
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,400
Pat's house looks nice and cozy.

24
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,080
But...

25
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,360
Your heart's probably not here.

26
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,760
You should be honest
with your feelings.

27
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,760
It'll be better for everyone,

28
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,880
for both you and Pat.

29
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,320
It's not too late

30
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,720
to rethink your decision.

31
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,480
Do you mind leaving, Krit?

32
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,360
I feel a little sick.
I want to rest.

33
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,560
Are you all right?
Do you want me to stay with you?

34
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,280
It's okay. I'm fine on my own.

35
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,920
Okay.

36
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,760
Call me if you need anything.

37
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,120
Thank you.

38
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,080
Krit.

39
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,800
About us...

40
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,920
Don't worry about it.

41
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,680
I can wait.

42
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,120
You must be
really confused right now.

43
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,640
I'm sorry
for making you feel that way.

44
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,480
But the more confused you are,

45
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,360
the more you'll realize
what you need to do about Pat.

46
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,760
You're just not ready yet.

47
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,240
I completely understand.

48
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,480
I know

49
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,520
that breaking up with someone

50
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,000
you’re about to marry

51
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,120
isn’t easy.

52
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,680
But like I said,

53
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,160
I can wait for you.

54
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,360
I’ll always be here,

55
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
no matter what.

56
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,680
Don’t overthink it.

57
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,080
I’ll always be here

58
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,720
for you.

59
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,680
I'll get going then.

60
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,880
Okay.

61
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,920
Marry me.

62
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
I promise

63
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,560
I’ll take good care of you.

64
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,080
I think

65
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,000
you and I have a lot in common.

66
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,280
Besides, I know

67
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,520
how you feel

68
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,520
about me.

69
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,760
I like you, May.

70
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,880
Pat.

71
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,480
How were you last night?

72
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,120
Last night...

73
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,440
What do you mean?

74
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,000
You were sick, weren’t you?

75
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,520
Like I said, I’m fine.

76
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
Good.

77
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,440
Pat.

78
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,080
Yes?

79
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Do you have something

80
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,200
to tell me?

81
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,560
Well...

82
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,880
I’m a little stressed out
about work.

83
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,840
But it’s okay, I can handle it.

84
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,840
I just wanted to tell you

85
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,000
I’m going out
to pitch to a client today.

86
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,000
You don’t need to come
to the office.

87
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,080
Good luck.

88
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Are you thinking about last night?

89
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,720
Let’s not talk about that here.

90
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,360
If you’re planning to come
see me again here,

91
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,640
please let me know beforehand.

92
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
May.

93
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,760
I'm sorry.

94
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,640
I don’t really know
what to do either.

95
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,120
If I call you, I’m afraid

96
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,080
you might be with Pat
and it will cause you trouble.

97
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,640
So I decided to come here instead,
since we discuss work here anyway.

98
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,200
Pat won’t find it suspicious.

99
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,520
Is he back?

100
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,880
How is he? Isn’t he at work?

101
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,440
Or...

102
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,560
Did you guys get into a fight?

103
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,880
No.

104
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,480
There’s nothing for him to do now,
so I told him not to come in.

105
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,200
He came back this morning.

106
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,320
I feel so guilty when I see him.

107
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,800
I don’t know

108
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,320
what I’m supposed to do.

109
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,240
May.

110
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,240
It's okay. It really is.

111
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,240
Don't overthink it.

112
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,440
I know

113
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,440
you’re trying your best

114
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
to make things right.

115
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,160
It’s not easy, is it?

116
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,840
Like I said, no matter what happens,

117
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,120
I’ll wait for you here.

118
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,040
Take your time.

119
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,160
I have to go see a client.

120
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,240
Pat.

121
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,000
I thought you were pitching
to a client.

122
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,680
Why are you with Krit?

123
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,360
Is this about work?

124
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,880
Why didn’t you invite me?

125
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,600
No, she didn’t know I was coming.

126
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,120
She’s leaving now.

127
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,720
I see.

128
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,800
I didn’t want to miss
anything important.

129
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,360
I was nearby,
so I dropped by to help out.

130
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,000
May, we have to go.

131
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,440
I have to go.

132
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,320
I’ll stay and work here
while I wait for you.

133
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,840
I don’t know what time
I’ll be done, Pat.

134
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Don’t wait for me.

135
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,480
I’ll leave too.

136
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
Let’s go together.

137
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,640
See you, Pat.

138
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,320
Okay.

139
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,320
Let's go.

140
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,880
Pat.

141
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,600
Excuse me,
I can’t find a client’s information.

142
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,040
I think there’s a backup
on a hard drive in May’s office.

143
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,240
But I don’t want to go in.

144
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,000
I’ll check it out for you.

145
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,200
- Thank you.
- No problem.

146
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,440
(Partnership Agreement)

147
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,480
(Komkrit Akaradechanont)

148
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,960
Are you done?

149
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,280
It was a successful pitch.

150
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,520
Congratulations.

151
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,360
Thank you.

152
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,960
I called to let you know
I’ll be home late.

153
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,760
I’m taking the team out
to celebrate.

154
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,160
Are you home, Pat?

155
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,720
No.

156
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,520
I'm at the office.

157
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,720
What? You're still there?

158
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,480
I told you not to wait for me.

159
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,560
Is something wrong?

160
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
No.

161
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Take care.

162
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,120
Where are you guys going tonight?

163
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,480
We’re at Krit’s bar.

164
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,480
The team wanted to come here.

165
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,480
Okay.

166
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,880
I’ll wait for you at home.

167
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,240
Okay.

168
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,320
You should've invited Pat
to come and celebrate.

169
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,520
He doesn’t like places like this,
so I didn’t invite him.

170
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
It’ll just be like last time again.

171
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,360
It’s good that you were honest
with him about coming here.

172
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,080
Better than him finding out
on his own or from someone else.

173
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,120
Don’t be stressed.

174
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,360
You just signed a deal
with a new client.

175
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,760
Like I said, if you want to get
something done your way,

176
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,680
you definitely can.

177
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,240
I believe
you’ll be able to do the same

178
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,440
with Pat.

179
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,520
Go all out tonight. It’s on me.

180
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,720
Pat.

181
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,800
You still haven’t come home.

182
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,440
I can’t let you have all the fun.

183
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,040
Please sit down, Pat.
I’ll get you something to drink.

184
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,720
Excuse me,
one glass of wine, please.

185
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,680
I heard you made
a successful pitch today.

186
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,160
Yes.

187
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,400
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

188
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,200
- Cheers.
- It's fine, Pat.

189
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,200
I can drink.

190
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,200
Cheers.

191
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,640
I said I'm fine.

192
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,440
We'll get going then,
May, Pat, and Krit.

193
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,080
- Let's go. Bye.
- Bye.

194
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
By the way, May.

195
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,440
I have a surprise for you.

196
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,840
Actually,

197
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,560
I wanted to give this to you
on your birthday,

198
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,760
but I was too eager.

199
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,560
Think of it

200
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,880
as a gift
for your successful pitch today.

201
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
Thank you, Pat.

202
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,720
Okay.

203
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,240
It's beautiful.

204
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,920
I wanted to let you know

205
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,440
that I’m ready
to support you in everything.

206
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,400
Every single thing you do.

207
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,160
I’m so proud of you.

208
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,960
I’ll always be here for you.

209
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,560
Thank you.

210
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,360
You haven’t told me
you love me lately.

211
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
Tell me.

212
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,640
Come on, please tell me.

213
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,720
Okay.

214
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,160
It’s okay if you don’t say it,

215
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,280
because I know you love me.

216
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,160
Pat.

217
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,960
I think you’ve had too much
to drink. Let’s go home.

218
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,080
I’ll get going, Krit.

219
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,840
Sure.

220
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Krit.

221
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,640
Thank you so much

222
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,800
for taking care of May
while I was away.

223
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,960
Let's go.

224
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,000
- Come on.
- Bye.

225
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,640
Pat, what's wrong?

226
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,320
Are you drunk?

227
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,920
No.

228
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,160
I'm not drunk.

229
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,080
I only had a little to drink.

230
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,040
I know what I’m doing.

231
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,840
I’m fully conscious.

232
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,560
Pat.

233
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,360
Why?

234
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,840
Am I not good enough?

235
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,640
Tell me what I need to improve on.

236
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,640
I’ll do better for you.

237
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,120
Just tell me.

238
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,680
Is there something

239
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,920
you’d like to tell me?

240
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,840
You’re keeping a secret from me,
aren’t you?

241
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,760
Right?

242
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,120
Tell me!

243
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,080
Tell me!

244
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,400
No, Pat. Let me go.

245
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,840
Tell me now.

246
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,640
- Pat.
- I said tell me.

247
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,560
Talk to me.

248
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,720
Pat!

249
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,040
What's the matter with you?

250
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,160
Go to sleep if you're drunk.

251
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,840
Let me go, Pat.

252
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,280
I love you.

253
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,280
I love you.

254
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,040
I want to have children with you.

255
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,200
I want to start a family with you.

256
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,920
Our wedding is coming up.

257
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,600
I can’t wait
to have children with you.

258
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,080
- Pat.
- May.

259
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,120
May, please...

260
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,280
I love you so much.

261
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,080
I love you.

262
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,160
(Emergency Contraceptive Tablet)

263
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,680
What's wrong with it?

264
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,680
What's wrong?

265
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,160
Huh?

266
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,600
It won't start.

267
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,760
Let me try.

268
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,400
Well...

269
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,360
We have to call a mechanic.

270
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,600
How about this?

271
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,680
Ride with me.

272
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,960
We can go to the office together.
It will save on gas.

273
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,640
May.

274
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,640
I’m sorry about last night.

275
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,560
I'm really sorry.

276
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,560
Yes, Krit.

277
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,640
How are you, May?

278
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,360
You didn’t answer my calls.

279
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,920
Are you sick?

280
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,360
My car broke down.

281
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,640
I just got to the office,
so I'm calling you back.

282
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,200
I’m meeting my friend
tonight at the bar,

283
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,400
in case you wanted to make up
for leaving early last time.

284
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,280
My friend wants to update us
on some new business ideas.

285
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,360
Are you interested?

286
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,120
I can’t go tonight.

287
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,680
Pat won’t let me take a taxi,
he’ll drive me there.

288
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,720
Also, I don’t know

289
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,920
what to tell him
about you and your friend,

290
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,320
because I didn’t tell him
we’re partners.

291
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,160
You haven’t told him?

292
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,040
It might be time to tell him
you’re a partner at the bar.

293
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,640
If he finds out on his own,

294
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,200
he’ll be even more suspicious.

295
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,240
I think

296
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,280
Pat’s already suspicious about us.

297
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,600
Did you notice him
acting strange last night?

298
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Really?

299
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,600
I think he was normal.

300
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,400
But you know him better than I do.

301
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,760
If you think
he’s starting to have doubts,

302
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,680
then maybe it’s time

303
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,560
for you

304
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,920
to tell him about us.

305
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,920
If you keep this going,

306
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,920
it might get worse.

307
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,200
Krit.

308
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,720
Let’s keep some distance
between us for now.

309
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,640
Let me make sure
that Pat’s really okay.

310
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,960
I also want some time alone
to figure out how I really feel.

311
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,920
And about not joining
you and your friends tonight,

312
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,080
I hope you understand.

313
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,960
I do.

314
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,920
Of course I do.
I understand everything.

315
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,680
If you’re stressed about something,

316
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,000
you can always call me.

317
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,960
Okay, thank you.

318
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,640
Excuse me.

319
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,760
I’m returning the hard drive
I borrowed yesterday.

320
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,560
Pat came in
and got it for me yesterday.

321
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,080
Pat.

322
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,040
I have something to tell you.

323
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,520
I’m a partner at Krit’s bar.

324
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,200
I haven’t had the chance
to tell you.

325
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,040
I know.

326
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,880
I know that you know.

327
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,600
You know that I know?

328
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Why are you only telling me now?

329
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,640
Well...

330
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,080
I was afraid you wouldn’t agree
with me about it,

331
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,320
so I didn’t tell you.

332
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,360
I’m sorry
for not telling you earlier.

333
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,520
Is there anything else I don’t know?

334
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,760
Honestly, is there something
you’re still hiding from me?

335
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,840
If you have secrets, tell me now
and I won’t get mad.

336
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,000
Or if you think we don’t have
a future, just say it.

337
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,160
You keep saying
you want to postpone the wedding.

338
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,720
Is it because
you don’t want to get married?

339
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,880
If you want to break up
with me, just tell me.

340
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,920
Say it.

341
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,480
I’m the one who should be crying.

342
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,880
Krit.

343
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,360
Is she really ignoring you?

344
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,760
She left early last time.

345
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,840
She didn’t come today.

346
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,200
Has she decided not to pick you?

347
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,960
Hey.

348
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,320
Maybe you should stop scheming
to fleece her.

349
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Find a new victim.

350
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,480
Help me.

351
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,120
With what?

352
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,880
(Krit)

353
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,080
It’s late.

354
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,200
Where are you going?

355
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,320
I...

356
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,840
I want to run some errands.

357
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,480
May I borrow your car?

358
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,560
I’ll take you there.
Where are you going?

359
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,160
It's okay.

360
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,600
Where are you going?

361
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,600
Let's talk later.

362
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,120
Krit.

363
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,120
What happened? Let me see.

364
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,400
Well...

365
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,520
I got into a fight with my friend.

366
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,280
Hit me harder.

367
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,600
Make it real.

368
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,000
Make her pity me so much

369
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,600
she leaves her boyfriend
and comes to me.

370
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,440
- Hit me.
- Sure.

371
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,960
So?

372
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,480
Like I said,

373
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,920
my friend cheated me.

374
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,960
I don’t have the cash
to pay him back,

375
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,200
so he beat me up.

376
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,200
Krit.

377
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,480
You should get a lawyer and sue him.

378
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,800
If you let this go,
he could hurt you even more.

379
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,920
I have a lawyer friend.
I’ll handle it.

380
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,960
May, let’s not make this a big deal.

381
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,200
I’ll take care of it on my own.

382
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,280
Thank you

383
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,160
for always rushing to see me
whenever I have a problem.

384
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,480
It has made me realize

385
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,160
who

386
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,440
I want to spend
the rest of my life with,

387
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,920
who’s always been by my side

388
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,400
and makes me feel at ease.

389
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,320
That person...

390
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,040
is you, May.

391
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,080
I don’t want to rush you.

392
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,160
But every time I see you,

393
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,040
you seem uncomfortable.

394
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,520
I can make you feel at peace.

395
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,200
Break up with Pat

396
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,480
and be with me.

397
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,320
I’ll help you talk to him.
I’m sure he’ll understand.

398
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,240
I love you.

399
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,920
We love each other.

400
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,040
Don't waste time
with someone you don’t love.

401
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,440
Pat.

402
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,480
Pat.

403
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,160
Pat.

404
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,880
Why?

405
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,440
You’re going to ask how I found out
you were here?

406
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,280
"Don’t worry about me, May.
I just had a fight with my friend."

407
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,120
Did I send it to you?

408
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,680
I was probably out of it
and sent it to the wrong person.

409
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,880
I’m so sorry, May.

410
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,280
What were you guys doing?

411
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,200
Go ahead, carry on.

412
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,120
Don’t worry, I know everything.

413
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,240
Do whatever you want from now on.
There’s no need to hide.

414
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,360
I’ll let you do whatever you want.

415
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,240
Go on.

416
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,200
Why not?

417
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,560
The May I know

418
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,280
isn’t afraid to do anything.

419
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Pat.

420
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,200
Pat.

421
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,520
Go ahead.

422
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,040
Krit.

423
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,040
If you don’t mind, I don’t mind.

424
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,240
Do you want to kiss her? Do it.

425
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,360
If you can’t choose, stay like this,
the three of us together forever.

426
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,080
Are you up for it?

427
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,440
Don't do it, Krit.

428
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,000
Stop, Pat.

429
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,600
Pat, stop. Come here.

430
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,480
Pat.

431
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,720
Let's go home.

432
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,040
Let her choose.

433
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,520
Let her choose
who she wants to be with.

434
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,440
Come home with me.

435
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,200
- Pat.
- Why are you crying?

436
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,920
Why are you crying?

437
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,640
Because I found out the truth,
or because I took you away from him?

438
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,520
How could you do this to me?

439
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,760
What did I do wrong?
All I ever did was love you.

440
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,720
I'm sorry, Pat.

441
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,080
I didn’t mean for it
to turn out this way.

442
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,760
You didn’t mean to?

443
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,960
You brought him into my house
and had sex right there.

444
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,840
You said you were sick that day.

445
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,000
I said I’d hurry home, but you told
me not to, because you cared.

446
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,080
But that wasn’t true.

447
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,880
You just wanted to invite him
over for sex.

448
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,400
I'm sorry.

449
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,560
I didn’t think you’d come home.

450
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,640
You didn’t think I’d come home?

451
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,280
If I didn’t come home,
you could go ahead and do it, right?

452
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,800
You didn’t know?

453
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,160
I don’t know what’s wrong with me,

454
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,680
or how I feel about anyone.

455
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,360
But I didn’t want it
to turn out like this.

456
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,600
All right. Don’t say anything else.

457
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,240
Stop it, Pat! Stop it.

458
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,480
Pat, let me see it.

459
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,320
Enough.

460
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,600
Stop pretending that you love
or care about me.

461
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,880
Now I get it.

462
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,640
You said we’re too different,
but that’s not true.

463
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,720
You just have feelings
for someone else.

464
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,200
That's it.

465
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,840
You stayed with me
because you felt sorry for me.

466
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,760
May, no more.

467
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,200
You don't have to change
for me anymore.

468
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,880
May.

469
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,880
Let's break up.

470
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,040
Let's end things here.

471
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,320
When you meet a good person you
don’t love, don’t hold them back.

472
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,480
Let them go find someone
who loves them more than you do.

473
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,360
We wish you happiness, Sexy May.

474
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,040
What are you doing here, Pat?

475
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,680
When you called me, it’s not that
I didn’t want to talk to you.

476
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,720
But the more you do this,
the guiltier I feel. Don’t do this.

477
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,240
The day you moved out
and Krit was waiting for you.

478
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,040
He saw me,

479
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,680
and the look in his eyes
wasn’t trustworthy.

480
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,760
Be careful.

481
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,240
When you hold him like that,
you will lean...

482
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,360
It's like, go away!

483
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,480
Go away.

484
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,040
You're so mean.

485
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,320
- I'm not a cockroach.
- She hates it.

486
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,800
I don't hate it.

487
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,800
Kiss her.

488
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,560
You can push him away.

489
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,840
- Let's go home.
- Let's go home.

490
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,800
I'm drunk.

491
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,160
Then...

492
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,160
Go ahead.
