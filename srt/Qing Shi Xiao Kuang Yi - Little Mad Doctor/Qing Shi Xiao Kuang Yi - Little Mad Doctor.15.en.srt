18
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:04,280
Please forgive me.

19
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,359
I'm to blame.

20
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:11,840
My Lord, please.

21
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:13,000
I didn't mean to do that.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,719
This is my first time

23
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,159
carrying a girl.

24
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:17,239
I was kind of nervous.

25
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,000
Please forgive me.

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,719
Make sure there's no next time.

27
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,640
Ah! I don't have the guts
for that again.

28
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,599
She's deeply sensitive

29
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,079
to discern

30
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,519
such details.

31
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,920
That's right.

32
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,680
Princess Jinghong is too good
at acting cute.

33
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,040
I can't resist.

34
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,120
Did she act cute towards you?

35
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,560
No, not to me.

36
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:04,680
To you.

37
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,680
Ah, it's me.

38
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,599
No, she was doing that to me
who's wearing your face.

39
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:14,919
Wushuang.

40
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,840
I said no to Ming Bao'er just now.

41
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,360
Please keep an eye on her

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,240
to keep her in check.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,400
I won't meet her for the time being.

44
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,919
But

45
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,960
it's not a good choice

46
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,240
to confine Ming Bao'er, right?

47
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,199
I just want to protect

48
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,560
the last descendant of the Ming family.

49
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,639
Alas.

50
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,360
Did Feibai ask you to come?

51
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,199
Yes.

52
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,319
Please go back.

53
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,599
I don't need you here.

54
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,319
I said you should leave.

55
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,599
Just now, I came
under His Highness's order.

56
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:28,199
But for now,

57
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,639
I come here myself.

58
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,520
I'm here as Wushuang.

59
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,719
Are you men all heartless?

60
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,439
No, I'm not like this.

61
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,560
(Perhaps I'm kind of jumpy now.)

62
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:59,520
(This thought is just ridiculous.)

63
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,759
Thanks to your plan,

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,600
we got to capture the culprit.

65
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,279
You will have to take over.

66
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,360
I will pry the answer out

67
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:42,720
of those who are brought

68
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:43,879
to the Internal Activities Depot.

69
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,160
Oh, right.

70
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,279
Please get that truth out

71
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,759
before the birthday banquet

72
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:48,879
of the empress.

73
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,560
No worries.

74
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,240
Why do you ask for me?

75
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,839
Tomorrow

76
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,000
is the birthday banquet of the empress.

77
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,160
You're going to present the gift

78
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,040
together with the delegations of Northern Chu.

79
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,680
I've prepared the gift.

80
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,040
This is the envoy

81
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,360
representing Northern Chu.

82
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,720
She will present the gift
together with you.

83
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,519
Just call her Guo.

84
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,240
Is this the gift?

85
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,040
What's this?

86
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,399
I'm going to unveil it.

87
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,000
Huh?

88
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:27,120
Seriously?

89
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,680
A plant?

90
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,040
Oh.

91
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,279
I get it.

92
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:32,560
Father tries

93
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,720
to hint to Emperor Zhaowu

94
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,120
that he's been cheated by the empress.

95
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,199
Gosh, shut up.

96
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,759
This is the Queen of the Night
with 99 blooms.

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,399
The Queen of the Night with 99 blooms?

98
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,079
This is what it looks like?

99
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,519
The birthday present

100
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,839
must be extraordinary.

101
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,600
I made the potion with my blood.

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,959
The moment you pour it into the soil,

103
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,480
the Queen of the Night will bloom
right away.

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,800
It must be astonishing.

105
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,160
There's also a legend about this plant.

106
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,759
We shall present it to the empress.

107
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,920
(Lord War's Residence)

108
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:06,360
Tonight, you're attending
with the delegations of Northern Chu.

109
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,639
I will dispatch my men to follow you.

110
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,519
Everything will be fine on my side.

111
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:17,720
But I'm worried about you.

112
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,279
Your Blood Curse will relapse tonight.

113
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,360
The banquet

114
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,639
ends at the hour of Hai

115
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,040
and it relapses two hours later.

116
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,560
It will be no problem.

117
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,040
My Lord.

118
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,439
Delegations of Northern Chu came
to fetch Princess Jinghong.

119
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:36,879
All right.

120
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,480
I will get going.

121
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:01,680
Guo.

122
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,560
Is the potion with you?

123
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,519
Make sure everything
proceeds as planned.

124
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,519
Rest assured, Your Highness.

125
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:08,279
Losing this potion
is like risking my neck.

126
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,560
I've practised this many times.

127
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:13,680
No one will see me
when I pour the potion.

128
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,519
Very good.

129
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,120
At ease.

130
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,120
Today is the birthday banquet
of the empress.

131
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,240
Please drop the honorifics

132
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,720
and make yourself comfortable.

133
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,360
-Thank you, Your Majesty.
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

134
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,319
(Where's Yu Longyuan?)

135
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,279
Here comes Lord War.

136
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:39,879
Greetings,

137
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,759
Your Majesties.

138
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:41,800
Take your seat.

139
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,600
(Oh, he's wearing that.)

140
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,920
Longyuan.

141
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,480
Look at you.

142
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,519
You're always late.

143
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,199
You ought to take the liquor thrice.

144
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:55,040
Don't turn it down.

145
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,160
Yes,

146
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,279
I will drink.

147
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,639
(Do you like)

148
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,519
(my outfit?)

149
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,399
(Yes.)

150
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,000
The monarch of Dongxia
deliberately sought

151
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:20,600
this natural pearl
from the depths of the East Sea.

152
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,920
I wish you many happy returns,
Your Majesty.

153
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,560
The pearls are huge.

154
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,199
This is peculiar, Your Majesty.

155
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
The emperor of Dongxia

156
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,600
is so considerate.

157
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,679
Thank you, Your Majesty.

158
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,519
Let's go.

159
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,559
I present you the gift from Northern Chu,

160
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,240
specially prepared

161
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,879
by my father and brother, Your Majesty.

162
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,000
This present

163
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,080
only listens to you.

164
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:51,519
Oh?

165
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,360
Chu Jinghong.

166
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,840
Is Northern Chu a poor state?

167
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,279
Presenting a plant as a birthday gift?
