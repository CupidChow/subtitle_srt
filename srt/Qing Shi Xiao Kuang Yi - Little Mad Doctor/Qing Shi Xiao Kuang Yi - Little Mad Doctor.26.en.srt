18
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:02,320
How could a woman
who goes against norms

19
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:04,439
and causes trouble to the court

20
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,719
be qualified as the empress?

21
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:10,280
If my father and brother
were to know about this,

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,599
they will seek justice for me

23
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,439
by charging an attack on you
with the entire military force.

24
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,200
Princess Jinghong has gone mad.

25
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,359
Men.

26
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,840
Send her to
the Imperial Academy of Physicians.

27
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,159
Why are you so anxious, Your Majesty?

28
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,079
Are you trying to hush up me?

29
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,159
I will make a bet with you.

30
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:35,799
If I can't live through tomorrow,

31
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,000
the regime of Shang

32
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,519
won't sustain before next year.

33
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,359
You...

34
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,439
Jinghong.

35
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:45,959
Would you rather die

36
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,120
than marry me?

37
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:56,280
She's my woman.

38
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,640
How dare you lay fingers on her?

39
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:04,560
I shall see

40
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,000
who forced my consort

41
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,520
to marry another man.

42
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,319
My Lord.

43
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,240
My Lord.

44
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:20,000
They've bullied me.

45
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:25,759
Jinghong.

46
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,360
Never fear, Jinghong.

47
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,000
I don't intend to kill anymore

48
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,960
and I'm sick

49
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,520
of violence.

50
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,719
From now on,

51
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:46,680
I just want

52
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,599
to lead a peaceful life with Jinghong.

53
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,520
I'm willing to hand over
the military power

54
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,400
as well as

55
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,400
the Internal Activities Depot.

56
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,520
Longyuan,

57
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,080
this is unconvincing though.

58
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,120
Your Majesty.

59
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,360
Longyuan is devious.

60
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,199
Don't let him fool you.

61
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,120
I've already figured out

62
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,960
that the Blood Curse in me

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
was done by you.

64
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,120
What an ambitious empress you are.

65
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,080
Not only did you own a secretive troop,

66
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,599
I also discovered

67
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,639
that you have close associates
from all the empires

68
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,479
colluding behind the scene.

69
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,159
The Empress

70
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,680
has everything in her control now.

71
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,159
Your Majesty.

72
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,800
Don't listen to him.

73
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,080
That's not true.

74
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,719
Your Majesty.

75
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,400
Lord War is trying to create confusion.

76
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:36,960
This is unforgivable.

77
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:37,879
That's right.

78
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,240
Lord War's lying

79
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,039
to get everyone confused. Men.

80
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,759
Take Lord War down.

81
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,039
Insolent!

82
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,919
Empress.

83
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,319
I seem to underestimate you.

84
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,039
Do you really think

85
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,759
I'm that incompetent?

86
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,639
I'm well aware

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,560
of what you've done

88
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,800
since a long time ago.

89
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,159
Longyuan managed to eliminate
all the betrayers this time.

90
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:07,759
I shall thank you for your army.

91
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,280
The empress's power

92
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,120
has grown immensely.

93
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,560
Longyuan,

94
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,240
do you have the confidence

95
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,439
to secretly eliminate them completely?

96
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,000
Your Majesty.

97
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,759
I will do my best.

98
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,120
If you manage to overcome this

99
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,439
for Shang,

100
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,639
I will grant

101
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,480
anything you ask for

102
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:30,680
even if

103
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,519
you want

104
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,680
to ascend

105
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,879
to the throne.

106
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:38,560
Your Majesty.

107
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,759
I've never thought

108
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,319
of taking the throne.

109
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,560
All I wish is a peaceful world

110
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,920
and the people thrive.

111
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:52,439
Someone once told me

112
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,279
that she wished for a world
where everyone is born equal

113
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,439
and doesn't need to bow down
to oppressive powers.

114
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,360
Everyone can live with dignity.

115
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,759
I also believe in this wish.

116
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,199
Everyone is born equal?

117
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:09,879
Do you know

118
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,639
it can be really hard to achieve?

119
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,079
Your Majesty,

120
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,279
after

121
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,360
I subdue the riots,

122
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:19,920
please allow me

123
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,480
to live in seclusion

124
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,519
and lead a peaceful life

125
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,759
together with Jinghong.

126
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,319
Father.

127
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,279
You can't do this to Mother.

128
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,040
Back off.

129
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:35,079
You're in no place to speak here.

130
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,680
Your Majesty.

131
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,720
Please don't believe him.

132
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,560
Your Majesty.

133
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,759
Please forgive me.

134
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,399
Please forgive me.
