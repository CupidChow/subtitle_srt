18
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,439
What's wrong?

19
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:08,879
Oh.

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:09,920
Your Highness.

21
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,239
The water is dirty.

22
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,560
I will get you a new one.

23
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,359
You lowly servant.

24
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,680
How dare you defy my order!

25
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,200
Given my kind nature,

26
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,959
I will give you one more chance.

27
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:08,879
My Lord.

28
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,879
I specially made this for you.

29
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,639
Have a taste.

30
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,599
This is stinky tofu.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,400
It's delicious and fragrant.

32
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:19,159
Smell it.

33
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,199
It smells really great, right?

34
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,280
Yes.

35
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,360
Ling'er.

36
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,639
How did you get hurt?

37
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:41,639
Ling'er.

38
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,520
Ling'er.

39
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:43,599
Ling'er.

40
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,159
What has happened to you?

41
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,280
I'm to blame.

42
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,719
Please punish me.

43
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,560
Get up.

44
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,960
Honestly,

45
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,639
I was sent by Yuan Feiyu to monitor you.

46
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,000
Yesterday,

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,319
she gave me a packet of medicine

48
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,360
and instructed me to put it
into your face-wash water.

49
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,280
Though I have no idea what it's,

50
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,919
I'm sure it must be something harmful.

51
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:09,840
So, I...

52
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,360
So, you told me

53
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,000
that water was dirty.

54
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,080
Yes.

55
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,240
Ling'er.

56
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,639
Get up.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,840
Yuan Feiyu intended
to disfigure your face.

58
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,680
Over these years of waiting on you,

59
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,400
I'm aware that you harbor a kind heart

60
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,159
and you treat me well

61
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,680
wholeheartedly.

62
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,120
I have been wanting to tell you this.

63
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,400
However,

64
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,199
Yuan Feiyu is too vicious.

65
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,360
That's why she beat you so badly.

66
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:44,919
Yes.

67
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:45,919
She did.

68
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,080
She gave me another packet

69
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,759
ordering me to harm you once again.

70
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,960
But I refuse to comply with her.

71
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,319
I just want to wait on you

72
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,479
purely and loyally.

73
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,039
Ling'er.

74
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,159
It's fine.

75
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:08,599
As long as you correct your mistake.

76
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,919
I won't blame you.

77
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,360
From now on,

78
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,080
please rest assured and stay by my side.

79
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,719
As for the rest,

80
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,319
I will take care of it.

81
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,279
Your Highness.

82
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,079
I'm truly sorry.

83
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,720
I'm too dense

84
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,160
and bring you trouble.

85
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,000
It's fine.

86
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,120
Go and take a good rest.

87
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,600
Jin'er.

88
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,879
Please take good care of her.

89
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:33,920
Ling'er.

90
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,920
Let's go.

91
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,000
Wen.

92
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,120
Do you think Second Prince will
like my dance?

93
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,600
Even I've besotted

94
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,639
with your graceful moves,

95
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,480
I'm sure Second Prince will like it too.

96
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,920
What a graceful dance.

97
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,120
Chu Jinghong, did you just slap me?

98
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,680
How dare you!

99
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,040
Yes, I did.

100
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,079
I will slap you whenever I want.

101
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,879
How could you slap me?

102
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,720
I didn't do that.

103
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,360
Oh?

104
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,279
What have you done?

105
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,879
I didn't say anything yet though.

106
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,240
Princess Feiyu.

107
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,680
I came here to tell you

108
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:33,480
that I don't need any reasons or proof
to slap you.

109
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,399
You just deserve it.

110
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,639
One slap for being overbearing.

111
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,040
One slap for being vicious.

112
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,839
Another slap
for oppressing the innocents.

113
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,800
Last but not least,
one slap for being dumb and evil.

114
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,079
You're a green-eyed monster.

115
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,360
The patient is 21 years old,

116
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,720
soft tissue injury.

117
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,639
The treatment should be done
in one hour.

118
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,079
What?

119
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:07,079
(I...)

120
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,959
(I have to heal her after slapping her?)

121
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,040
Your Highness.

122
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
(My hand is dirty.)

123
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,959
(He won't like it.)

124
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:33,360
(Forget it.)

125
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,160
Ah.

126
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,639
Jinghong.

127
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,279
I won't let you leave anymore.

128
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,560
I want you to stay with me willingly.

129
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,519
But I don't belong to you.

130
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,160
Jinghong.

131
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,079
I need you

132
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,199
and so do you.

133
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,319
Why should two people
who need each other part ways

134
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,360
over a minor annoyance?

135
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,399
My Lord.

136
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:19,720
I've found the method
to break the Blood Curse.

137
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,000
After solving it,

138
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,480
I will go back.

139
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,800
By that time,

140
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:28,879
I won't force you to stay

141
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,439
if you still insist.

142
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:36,000
But my protection over you

143
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,600
is valid for good.

144
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,279
Forever and always.

145
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,680
Forever and always?

146
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,680
Are you sure?

147
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,600
You're honey-tongued.

148
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,920
I think

149
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,439
I've grown fond of you.

150
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:56,519
Jinghong.

151
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:59,079
I need to be away for some business
these days.

152
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,720
Please wait for me at the residence.

153
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,000
Sure.

154
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,199
I will take care of myself.

155
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,959
Where can I get the twelve herbs?

156
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,959
When can I

157
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,720
concoct the Yuhua Pill?

158
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,200
It's you.

159
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,879
What brings you here?

160
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,759
Princess Jinghong.

161
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,279
I'm sorry to come at this late hour.

162
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,080
But something urgent happens,

163
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:50,720
I need your help to save someone.

164
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,000
What's wrong with you?

165
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,639
Are you all right?

166
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,240
I'm fine.

167
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:02,919
Here.

168
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,000
Take this.

169
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:07,399
Let's go.

170
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,399
Don't worry.

171
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,159
I will handle this.

172
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:32,559
I will wait for you outside.

173
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,080
Please don't go anywhere.

174
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,120
Be careful of your wound.

175
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,120
I will come to you later.

176
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,240
How's she?

177
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,279
With my skills, she's very fine.

178
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,759
Thank you so much.

179
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:04,440
You're welcome.

180
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,279
What about you?

181
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:06,960
How's your wound?

182
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,799
Let me check it.

183
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,000
Well.

184
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,120
It's superficial. Thank you.

185
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:13,320
I see.

186
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,080
She's fine now.

187
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,440
Thank you for your help.

188
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,159
It's cool.

189
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,559
Remember to dress your wound
in two days.

190
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:28,960
Sure.

191
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,440
I will remember this.

192
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:30,519
Let me escort you back.

193
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:30,840
Sure.

194
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,759
Close your eyes.

195
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,000
What?

196
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:41,879
Listen to me,

197
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
close your eyes.

198
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,639
Open your eyes when you count to ten.
