Jinghong.

19
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,040
Yu Heng?

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,280
What are you doing here?

21
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:10,200
Jinghong.

22
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:11,480
Princess Liangyu

23
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:12,680
disappeared suddenly.

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,719
Father

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,840
summoned me to dispatch more guards

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,239
to protect princesses of all empires.

27
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,000
If you like.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,439
Jinghong.

29
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:22,799
Father and Mother

30
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,439
have a convincing motive to kill you,

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,920
but they refrain from doing so

32
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,760
out of fear of Uncle Thirteen.

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,439
Concerning their fear,

34
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,599
I'm still safe now.

35
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:35,640
Your Highness.

36
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,799
Please leave.

37
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,159
What if they're not fear anymore

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,519
as Uncle Thirteen can't return?

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,680
What did you say?

40
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,920
What do you mean?

41
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:46,920
What has happened to His Highness?

42
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,280
Battleground

43
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,599
is full of dangers.

44
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,120
If Lord War

45
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,920
dies on the battleground.

46
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,439
Impossible.

47
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,000
I will ask Father to issue a decree

48
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,480
for us to be married.

49
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,519
I want you back.

50
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,319
Lord War won't return anymore.

51
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,400
The day he comes to fetch you
will never come.

52
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,560
Princess.

53
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,560
She's mad?

54
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:47,759
Yes.

55
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,439
Princess Liangyu

56
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,360
disappeared

57
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,240
after dancing on the street.

58
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,159
Stop already.

59
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,400
This is never going to happen.

60
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,479
Mother.

61
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,360
If Yu Longyuan were to find out

62
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,800
that Chu Jinghong

63
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:04,919
marries another man,

64
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,479
he will be devastated

65
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,039
in the battleground.

66
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,719
Your Majesty.

67
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,319
Heng

68
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,960
is besotted with Chu Jinghong's beauty

69
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,240
and falls deeply for her.

70
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,400
As his mother,

71
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,159
I feel heartbroken to see him suffer.

72
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,400
Your Majesty,

73
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,159
I'm to blame

74
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,159
for pampering Heng too much,
not his fault.

75
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,120
This wedding

76
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:07,639
will be

77
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,879
handled by you.

78
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:10,719
Thank you, Your Majesty.

79
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,840
To accomplish Heng's wish,

80
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,080
I will make sure everything

81
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,199
is done perfectly.

82
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:17,920
Sure.

83
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,639
The wedding date...

84
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,680
The wedding of the prince

85
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:23,720
should be taken seriously.

86
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:25,839
It will be held

87
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,480
on the fifteenth of the month.

88
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,560
Thank you, Your Majesty.

Did you hear about that?

105
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,800
Princess Jinghong's hair
turned grey overnight.

106
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:33,720
How pitiful of her.

107
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,040
I heard that it's because
she overly misses Lord War.

Greetings,

111
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:12,279
Your Majesty.

112
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,360
May you be well.

113
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,079
You don't seem surprised

114
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,879
to see me here.

115
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,040
My hairpin.

116
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,680
Why is it with you?

117
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,079
I got this

118
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,800
from Longyuan.

119
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,959
He has been bringing this

120
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,279
with him.

121
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,360
He didn't let go of it

122
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,800
even when he was about
to breathe his last.

123
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,759
Apparently, Longyuan possesses

124
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,879
such a deep affection for you.

125
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:02,560
What do you mean?

126
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,079
Why did you say so?

127
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,399
Where's His Highness?

128
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,600
Answer me. Where's he?

129
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,240
Calm down.

130
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,959
He's not dead yet.

131
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,720
However, his fate depends on

132
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:22,959
whether or not you obey me.

133
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:27,959
