Helan Ci, how insolent of you

19
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,399
to intrude upon Lord War's Residence!

20
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,480
Are you insane?

21
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,680
Relay my message

22
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,879
that I will give an answer
that satisfies everyone.

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,200
My Lord.

24
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:14,359
In that case,

25
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,079
I shall take my leave.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,040
Move.

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,879
Jinghong.

28
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,079
You may go back and take a rest.

29
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,280
As for Dongxia,

30
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:29,319
I will handle this.

31
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,760
(The situation is getting complicated.)

32
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,040
(I must concoct the antidote to cure
the Blood Curse in Yu Longyuan.)

33
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:37,719
(Otherwise...)

34
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,560
Princess Jinghong.

35
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:44,000
I want to speak to Eunuch Ye.

36
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:44,879
Is he here?

37
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,640
Director Ye is interrogating
the suspect.

38
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,640
He doesn't receive guests today.
Please go back, Your Highness.

39
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:49,920
I see.

40
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,719
Ye Feibai's subordinates
aren't capable enough though.

41
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,599
I can sneak in here easily.

42
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,680
Gosh.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,959
This place is huge.

44
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,480
Where should I find Ye Feibai?

45
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:38,919
My Lord.

46
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,280
Let's get in.

47
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,759
You're aware of what has happened today,
aren't you?

48
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,759
Yes.

49
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,000
My Lord.

50
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,919
Are you really leaving?

51
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:53,800
After I've left,

52
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,280
please play the role of Ye Feibai well
for me.

53
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,360
As long as Ye Feibai is here,

54
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,879
we'll continue receiving intel.

55
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,479
No worries.

56
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,120
Oh, right.

57
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,039
Bao'er

58
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,639
told me about that.

59
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,120
What's it?

60
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:12,919
On the day of the wedding
of Princess Jinghong and you,

61
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,840
you plotted against both the emperor
and empress to halt it.

62
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,639
If Princess Jinghong knows about this,

63
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,120
she will be heartbroken.

64
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:22,560
My Lord.

65
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,120
Will you still marry her

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,840
after coming back?

67
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,439
I will confess everything about this

68
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,199
to her.

69
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:33,960
My Lord.

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,520
You need to think this through.

71
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,479
What if

72
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,360
Princess Jinghong springs a leak?

73
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,719
It's just a concern.

74
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,080
I'm worried

75
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,439
that how Chu Jinghong would react

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
if she couldn't accept the truth.

77
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,479
Besides, at this juncture...

78
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,400
Well.

79
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,520
We will talk about this
when I return.

80
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,199
I need to attend to something now.

81
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,319
Get changed.

82
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,400
Sure.

83
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,480
Perfect.

84
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:24,720
Let's leave.

85
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:25,920

I went to meet you after that,
