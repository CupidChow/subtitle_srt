I would prefer
if you sat within my embrace.

19
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:04,239
So that we can talk

20

21

Please leave
if you're not going to tell me.

22
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,599
I'm not interested in it, after all.

00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:13,319
Oh, my.

24
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:14,040
Young lady.

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,239
You're fickle.

26
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,599
I didn't beg you to save me.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,079
You shouldn't expect rewards from me.

28
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:22,920
Fine.

29
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:24,640
I won't force you.

30
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:25,920
However,

31
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,920
if you're curious about why I saved you,

32
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,599
please come to Yunyu Parlor.

33
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,439
Maybe

34
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:33,319
you may find out the reason

35
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:35,280
as well as

36
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,920
the way to break
the Blood Curse from me.

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,799
(It seems)

38
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,680
(I must go to Yunyu Parlor.)

39
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,180
(Lord War's Residence)

40
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:57,159
Princess Jinghong and you...

41
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,519
Nothing has happened between us.

42
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,680
I was asking

43
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,480
when you discovered

44
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,000
that the Blood Curse in you
was alleviated

45
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,560
when you were near her.

46
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,400
Why did you save me?

47
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,960
Touch it with your hand.

48
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:20,280
This...

49
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,319
Gosh.

50
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,080
What...

51
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,400
What's going on?

52
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,000
Jinghong.

53
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,280
You

54
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,599
are my younger sister.

55
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,159
Huh?

56
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,120
I'm younger sister?

57
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,759
Yes.

58
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,800
Wait. I need some time to sort this out.

59
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:42,719
I'm the princess of Northern Chu

60
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,840
and you're the owner of Yunyu Parlor.

61
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:44,639
My last name is Chu

62
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,520
but yours is Hua.

63
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,639
You said I'm your sister?

64
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:47,919
Yes.

65
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,800
I need to go back to prepare meals.

66
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,240
I won't blame you

67
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,039
for not knowing me.

68
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,599
You were sent to Shang

69
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,400
when you were little.

70
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,680
Since then,

71
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,360
I've been hiding
in the capital of Shang.

72
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:04,039
Why didn't you come to me
over these years?

73
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:05,879
When

74
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,039
I was bullied,

75
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,719
you never showed up even once.

76
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,680
I'm waiting in the wing

77
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,280
for an important task here,

78
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,520
it's too dangerous

79
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,199
to meet with you.

80
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:18,400
Why did you choose to acknowledge me

81
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,759
at this time?

82
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,199
You shouldn't have approached Lord War.

83
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,599
Yu Longyuan

84
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,159
only cares about his power.

85
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:30,120
You said that I'm your blood sister.

86
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,120
Tell me how to solve the Blood Curse.

87
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,680
To solve the Blood Curse,

88
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,080
the first method

89
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,039
only helps to relieve his pain.

90
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,560
As I told you,

91
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,719
you need

92
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,800
to have a intimate relations
with Lord War.

93
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,560
The moment when royal descendants
of the Northern Chu are born,

94
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,759
we're immersed in the herbal bath

95
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,759
made of the Queen of the Night.

96
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,159
That explains why our body

97
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,879
exudes an aura
that resists the Blood Curse.

98
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:49,719
When you get close to him,

99
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,159
the Blood Curse in him will be delayed.

100
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,680
What's the second method?

101
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,800
By refining a Yuhua Pill.

102
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,520
What's Yuhua Pill?

103
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,319
It's refined

104
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,000
by twelve precious herbs

105
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:04,919
and it dissolves toxins

106
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,000
and purifies the blood.

107
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:06,719
Supposedly,

108
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,120
by consuming Yuhua Pill,

109
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,199
one can be as strong as immortals.

110
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,240
It's very difficult

111
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,479
to even find one

112
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,879
of these twelve herbs.

113
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,120
Thank you for your advice.

114
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,240
I will get going.

115
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,480
Don't get so close to Lord War.

116
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,120
He took you in
and has been protecting you

117
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,319
because he knew
that you could relieve his pain

118
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,160
one step ahead of me.

119
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:27,800
Given his nature,

120
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,720
do you think he would approach you
for no reason?

121
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,240
Ask yourself

122
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,279

Yes.

173
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,120
Sigh.

174
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,079
This is so heavy.

175
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,879
Why bother to bring it along

176
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,279
when we're coming back later?

177
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,079
My Lord.

178
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,879
Princess Jinghong

179
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,199
has returned to Suoqing Palace.

180
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,279
Sod you, wretched Chu Jinghong.

181
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:29,600
I'm going to destroy her

182
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,360
sooner or later.

183
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,120
Previously, our hands are tied

184
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,560
because she stayed
in Lord War's Residence.

185
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:38,439
Now

186
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,319
that she's coming back suddenly,

187
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:43,040
she must be chucked out
by Lord War for sure.

188
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,920
She has lost protection from Lord War.

189
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,959
This is the routine we do

190
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,199
in Lord War's Residence.

191
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,519
What else did Chu Jinghong do?

192
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,040
Rest assured, Your Highness.

193
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,040
I've been keeping a close on her.

194
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,720
I didn't miss out on anything.

195
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,360
Well done.

196
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:09,879
Go and get your rewards.

197
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,160
Thank you.

198
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:12,639
Hold on.

199
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,000
Do you have any orders?

200
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,439
Tomorrow morning,

201
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,879
put this into her basin.

202
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:41,480
Your Highness.

203
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:42,799
Get ready to freshen up.

204
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:43,240
Yes.

205
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:43,840
All right.
