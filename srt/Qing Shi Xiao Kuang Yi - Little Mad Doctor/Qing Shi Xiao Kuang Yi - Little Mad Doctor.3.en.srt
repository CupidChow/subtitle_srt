(a tinge of pity from her eyes?)

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,439
You're so good looking.

24
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,079
Why do you wear a mask?

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:44,920
Eunuch Ye.

26
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:45,760
Thank you.

27
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,640
You may go back now, Your Highness.

28
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,680
Lord War said

29
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:03,840
it's not necessary for you
to return here

30
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,439
if you can simply leave here
as you wish.

31
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,199
We never shelter idlers

32
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:09,560
(Longsan)
or good-for-nothing.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,080
Tell Lord War

34
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:13,120
that I'm not going to leave this place.

35
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,319
Princess Jinghong.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,080
No one is allowed

37
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,840
to enter the study without permission.

38
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,560
Please return to your room.

39
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,479
Return?

40
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:28,680
To where?

41
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,039
Fusheng Abode of Suoqing Palace

42
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,759
or the guest room here?

43
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,599
Let her in.

44
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:55,960
I don't care if you chuck me out.

45
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,479
Give me back my things

46
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,520
and this is our farewell.

47
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,120
Give it back to me.

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,840
Your Highness.

49
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,080
It's my fault.

50
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,159
You're not so dense after all.

51
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,000
My Lord.

52
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,439
I have no one to rely on

53
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
and I always got bullied

54
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,439
in Suoqing Palace.

55
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:54,680
I wish I could never

56
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,240
return to that ruddy place.

57
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:57,680
My Lord, I beg of you.

58
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,680
Please take me in.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,560
I'm willing

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,879
to do everything

61
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,319
you ask.

62
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,520
Everything?

63
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,680
No...not really.

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,520
You may stay at Hanlu Abode.

65
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:14,759
All right.

66
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:29,600
No way.

67
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,319
The credit for saving a person
is so little?

68
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,519
When can I return
to the real world then?

69
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,639
Wen.

70
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,600
How come that stupid Chu Jinghong
hasn't been kicked out by Lord War yet?

71
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,240
Lord War will never like her.

72
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,639
What if Lord War sees
her true countenance?

73
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,800
Wen.

74
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,680
Did I see it wrong?

75
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,959
All men will definitely

76
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,920
swoon over her beauty.

77
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,560
Your Highness.

78
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,560
Chu Jinghong is doing something.

79
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,480
Does she?

80
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,839
She brought along some weird stuff

81
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,720
and set up a healing kiosk
on the street.

82
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,160
However, the way she treats patients
seems strange.

83
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,639
(Cheng'er)

84
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,360
(Cheng'er)
I have never seen it before.

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,800
Chu Jinghong.

86
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:16,680
I will prevent you from
getting close to Lord War.

87
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,079
Everyone.

88
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,560
Please queue in line.

89
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,960
(Jin'er)

90
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,560
You just got a little feverish.

91
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,399
It will be recovered by taking medicine.

92
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,120
Thank you.

93
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,959
Chu Jinghong.

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,920
How shameless of you.

95
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,079
How could you do this in the public?

96
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,600
Your Highness.

97
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,160
I set up a mobile clinic

98
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,879
and the treatment is free of charge.

99
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,920
Why am I shameless?

100
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,759
You!

101
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,439
What are you up to?

102
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,800
If you're doing this to please me

103
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:50,959
and marry you,

104
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,680
that's never going to happen.

105
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,800
I shall thank you for not marrying me.

106
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,720
What did you just say?

107
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,040
A few days ago,

108
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,800
you gave away me to Lord War

109
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,680
because you couldn't pay
ten thousand silver taels.

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,439
You seem to have forgotten this already.

111
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,279
In that case,

112
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:10,959
I think

113
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,839
I belong to Lord War, right?

114
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,240
Chu Jinghong.

115
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,360
Quit talking nonsense.

116
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,879
There's no way

117
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,120
you can be the consort of Lord War.

118
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,439
I never want to marry Lord War.

119
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,759
It was Second Prince who gave me away

120
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,360
because of ten thousand silver taels.

121
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,759
I was there that day.

122
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,240
It wasn't like what you said.

123
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,519
I wonder what was it like that day.
