00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:01,520
What if

19
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:03,240
I'm a lowly person?

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,799
Lowly...person?

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,920
Greetings, Second Prince.

22
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,159
Please forgive me.

23
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:13,000
What a shame.

24
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,159
The dessert fell

25
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:17,959
before I get a bite.

26
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:19,159
Please forgive me.

27
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,599
Please grant me a chance.

28
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,120
I can prepare a new dessert for you.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,959
What's your name?

30
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,519
I'm Jin'er.

31
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:28,879
Jin'er.

32
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:29,959
Well.

33
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:32,319
I shall taste the dessert

34
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,640
you make right now.

35
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:36,799
Yes.

36
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,040
It tastes

37
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,200
pretty good.

38
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,040
But

39
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,159
something lacks.

40
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,200
Something lacks?

41
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,280
Everything

42
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,719
possesses a feeling.

43
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:04,840
If you treat her well,

44
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,879
she will repay the kindness you extend.

45
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,520
Just like what I did to you.

46
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,000
I granted you grace
and you will remember it.

47
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:15,719
Am I right?

48
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,919
Please forgive me.

49
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,759
I'm incapable.

50
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,439
Why are you shivering?

51
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,560
I savored the lotus cake,

52
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,919
but there's something
I have yet to taste it.

53
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,319
Do consider what I have said.

54
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,960
Deliver me the lotus cake

55
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,240
that carries some feelings
a few days later.

56
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,639
Jin'er.

57
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,000
What took you so long?

58
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,879
Ah.

59
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,080
I just went back to the palace.

60
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,280
It's been a long while

61
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,800
and I forgot where I placed the clothes.

62
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:57,560
Jin'er.

63
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,039
Did you buy a new hairpin?

64
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,879
Ah?

65
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,400
Oh.

66
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,240
I passed by a stall just now.

67
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,479
I bought it

68
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,560
because it looks dainty.

69
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:06,479
Show it to me.

70
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,240
It must be pretty

71
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:07,919
if I wear it.

72
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,280
I need to head back

73
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,360
to my room now.

74
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:12,800
Hmph!

75
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,599
How petty.

76
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:14,919
It's a mere hairpin.

77
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,159
Jin'er.

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,960
Are you going out again?

79
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:28,719
Yes.

80
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,759
I went to purchase something
for Her Highness.

81
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,840
I see.

82
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,560
Jin'er has been going out
a dozen times recently.

83
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,680
Have you done

84
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,240
what I entrusted you?

85
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,560
Yes.

86
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,279
Your Highness.

87
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,600
Jin'er.

88
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:24,759
You come at the right time.

89
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:24,959
Come on.

90
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:25,839
Let's start the mobile clinic.

91
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:26,759
Your Highness.

92
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,360
Today is the first day of the month,
there's a lantern festival.

93
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,600
Let's go there.

94
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,079
Lantern festival?

95
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:32,920
It's really fun

96
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,279
and much delicious food there.

97
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:34,879
Really?

98
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:35,160
Yes.

99
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,199
That's right.

100
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,519
I guess

101
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,920
not many people would come

102
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,399
to the clinic today.

103
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,560
You have a point.

104
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,439
Your Highness.

105
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,879
Let's go to the lantern festival.

106
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,079
Sure.

107
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,600
I will invite His Highness.

108
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,399
Your Highness.

109
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,040
His Highness

110
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,000
doesn't like crowdy events.

111
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,040
Also,

112
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,639
it's ill-advised

113
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,800
if someone recognizes
His Highness there.

114
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,240
You're right.

115
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,079
Well, let's go.

116
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:02,879
Sure.

117
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:20,800
Your Highness.

118
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
There are lantern riddles ahead.

119
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,199
Let's go.

120
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:23,439
Sure.

121
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,480
I'm really good at this.

122
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,759
Your Highness.

123
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:41,600
Your Highness.

124
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:47,839
How's she?

125
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,839
No worries.

126
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
I suppose she's fine.

127
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,040
You suppose?

128
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,800
I want a confirmed answer.

129
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:54,920
Your Highness.

130
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,040
Please remain composed.

131
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,680
She will be fine

132
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,240
since the imperial physician said so.

133
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,160
But she hasn't woken up yet.

134
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,680
Your Highness.

135
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,319
If Princess Jinghong
were to wake up now,

136
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,199
she will definitely seek Lord War.

137
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,439
And you will lose your chance.

138
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,600
Also,

139
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,759
Lord War

140
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,959
will come to seek her too.

141
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,839
She's going to marry him soon.

142
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,759
Your Highness.

143
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:25,800
You...

144
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,800
Can you figure out something

145
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,120
to halt her marriage?

146
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,360
There's nothing much I can do.

147
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,279
Both of them have one final step left

148
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,959
to become a truly married couple.

149
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,560
Final step left?

150
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,920
What if

151
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,480
I take the final step?

152
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,160
Can I bring everything back
to where it started?

153
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:05,959
I...

154
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,600
I didn't do anything.

155
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:09,959
Why am I here?

156
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:13,920
My Lord.

157
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,079
I've used ice and herbs

158
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:15,639
to suppress

159
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,639
the poison in you.

160
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,000
But this is only a stopgap.

161
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:18,720
My Lord.

162
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:19,639
Something bad has happened!

163
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,560
Her Highness was carried away
by Second Prince.

164
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,279
What?

165
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,120
I will forget this happened

166
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,079
since you saved me

167
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,040
today.

168
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,759
Are you leaving?

169
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,279
You can't go.

170
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,759
You can't go to Uncle Thirteen.

171
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:36,959
Yu Heng.

172
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,439
We've not related anymore.

173
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,720
Please behave yourself.

174
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,800
Don't go.

175
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:43,199
What are you doing?

176
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,590
♪I sigh at my life♪

177
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,150
