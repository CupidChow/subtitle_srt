18
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:01,439
Should I address you as Director Ye

19
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,679
or

20
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,920
Lord War?

21
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:07,920
I wonder what's your identity

22
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:09,359
in the capital.

23
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,079
Should I call you Master Hua

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,599
or the Crown Prince?

25
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,920
As expected from the most sensitive
intelligence agency of Shang.

26
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,400
Today,

27
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,519
I came here for one thing.

28
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,439
Please let Chu Jinghong go.

29
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:27,719
Don't take her as your wife

30
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,719
or mess up with her.

31
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:31,640
As for people and state

32
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,319
she wants to protect,

33
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:34,680
as her brother,

34
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,760
I will fulfil her wishes.

35
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:37,599
Why did you say so?

36
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,400
Needless to say,

37
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,359
people who hold
different stances and motives

38
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:44,920
shouldn't be shoved together.

39
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:46,799
Lord War, you're scheming

40
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:49,120
and all you do is for your own sake.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,599
You never

42
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:52,439
hold her dearly.

43
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,519
How can you be sure

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,079
that I don't?

45
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,519
Since you've learnt of my identity,

46
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,319
you should know that everything I did

47
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,920
is for the sake of my sister.

48
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:03,439
You should consider this well.

49
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,519
How do I know

50
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,120
what you're after?

51
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,599
The thing is

52
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,039
if you don't hurt her,

53
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,599
I won't attack you

54
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,960
no matter who you are.

55
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,280
Likewise,

56
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,599
if you were to hurt her,

57
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,120
I won't let you off the hook

58
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,680
no matter who you are.

59
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,479
Interesting.

60
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,000
Very interesting.

61
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,280
Scram.

62
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,719
Don't you cling to Second Prince.

63
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:42,800
Get out of here.

64
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,039
Please pass this to His Highness.

65
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,000
Leave right now.

66
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,040
(Lord War's Residence)

67
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,280
Apologies, Miss Jin'er.

68
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,719
Without Lord War's order,

69
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,439
you're not allowed to enter.

70
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,500
(Lord War's Residence)

71
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,280
Look at your pitiful face.

72
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,439
Come with me.

73
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,080
I shall offer you some food.

74
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,159
Don't forget you're pregnant now.

75
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,759
If you don't eat,

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,400
your baby will suffer.

77
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,879
I don't intend to save you.

78
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,199
But I'm a merciful woman.

79
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,600
Why did you save her, Your Highness?

80
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:23,920
I'm afraid Second Prince will be upset.

81
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:27,000
No, I never wanted to save her.

82
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,920
A lowly maidservant

83
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,079
just doesn't deserve

84
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,680
to give birth to royal descent.

85
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,079
Then...

86
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,560
Why have you done this?

87
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:39,000
Today is the first day of the new year.

88
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,720
I'm going to prepare a present

89
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,879
for Chu Jinghong.

90
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:52,959
Why hasn't His Highness back yet?
We're waiting for the meal.

91
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:54,319
Your Highness.

92
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,120
Chunyu came here.
The maidservant of Wen Liangyu.

93
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,399
Greetings, Princess Jinghong.

94
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,519
What are you doing here?

95
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,120
This is a present from Princess Liangyu.

96
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,079
A present from Wen Liangyu?

97
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,000
It must be something grim.

98
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,399
I won't accept this.

99
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:09,920
Bring it back.

100
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,399
Princess Jinghong.

101
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Her Highness said

102
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,519
if you don't accept this,

103
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,959
I can't be back alive.

104
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:29,600
Jin'er.

105
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,319
I made this ring.

106
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:31,920
This is for you.

107
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,040
Your Highness.

108
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,920
What about me?

109
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,360
Sure there is.

110
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,000
These are our best friend rings,

111
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:40,160
representing our friendship.

112
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,439
Jin'er.

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,319
Jin'er is with you.

114
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,480
Her Highness said

115
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,519
that if you're curious about the answer,

116
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,639
find it in Suoqing Palace.

117
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,759
What dirty trick she's doing again?

118
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,160
Jin'er has betrayed me.

119
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,680
Her life

120
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,079
doesn't concern me.

121
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,079
If you don't go,

122
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,079
Her Highness will assign me
to send one gift here every day

123
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,120
until Jin'er...

124
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,680
Enough.

125
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,519
Fine, I will go.

126
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,560
She's being so cruel
to a pregnant woman.

127
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,519
I will punish her

128
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,480
in the name of justice.

129
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,839
Sese.

130
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,240
Inform Yu Longyuan

131
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,199
to go to Suoqing Palace.

132
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:25,839
Yes.

133
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,199
Jinghong.

134
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,040
Wen Liangyu's target
has always been you.

135
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,360
She must be harboring an evil intention

136
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,360
to lure you there.

137
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,800
