18
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:01,159
My Lord.

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,640
This is your favourite
sweet corn with pine nuts.

20
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:07,879
Do you know
the cousin sister of Ye Feibai?

21
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,159
I can't recall her name.

22
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:09,920
Oh, right.

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,159
It's Ming Bao'er.

24
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,280
What's wrong?

25
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:16,719
Why do you ask about her?

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,120
Well.

27
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:19,879
Nothing. I'm just curious.

28
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,719
His cousin seems

29
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:22,760
to have great interest in him.

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,200
I wonder what he thinks about her.

31
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,959
He doesn't have any interest in her.

32
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:28,560
How do you know?

33
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,680
I think Ye Feibai

34
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,799
deserves someone to treat him sincerely.

35
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:35,519
However, I think his cousin

36
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:36,760
doesn't suit him.

37
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:37,719
If so,

38
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,200
what do you think of Ye Feibai,

39
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,719
Princess Jinghong?

40
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,400
He's strong despite his crippled body.

41
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:50,040
what do you think

42
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,879
about Ye Feibai

43
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,120
and Lord War?

44
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,799
Lord War is no doubt the best.

45
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,840
The only best man.

46
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,040
Ming Yueye.

47
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:08,280
Ye Feibai.

48
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,639
Both their backgrounds

49
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,319
are mysterious.

50
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,719
They appear

51
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,120
to have emerged from nowhere.

52
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:22,080
Emerged from nowhere?

53
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,280
Ming Yueye also goes by another name,

54
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,360
Ming Bao'er.

55
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:29,520
You may leave.

56
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,639
Yes.

57
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,560
Feibai

58
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:52,039
is going to get married tomorrow?

59
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:58,479
Your Highness.

60
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,319
The wedding gown and hair accessories
for tomorrow are ready.

61
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:03,039
I have asked someone to send them back
to Suoqing Palace.

62
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:03,879
Huh?

63
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,599
Sent back to Suoqing Palace?

64
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:06,120
Yes.

65
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,879
Oh, right.

66
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,319
Will His Highness come to fetch me

67
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,000
with a grandeur procession?

68
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,000
Certainly.

69
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,840
Your Highness.

70
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,000
Your wedding gown is done.

71
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:15,759
Huh?

72
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:18,039
The servants delivered
the gown to Suoqing Palace.

73
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,639
So, I went all the way to get them back.

74
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,280
Ling'er.

75
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,360
Your Highness will be fetched
from Suoqing Palace.

76
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:25,120
Why did you take them back?

77
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,039
It's fine.

78
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,159
It's fine to get them back here.

79
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,080
I shall see how
my wedding gown looks like.

80
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:47,680
Are you insane?

81
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,159
What has Chu Jinghong done

82
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,960
to beguile you?

83
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,039
I have reminded you several times

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,520
not to offend Uncle Thirteen

85
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,120
before your power is established.

86
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:01,360
Look

87
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,639
what you've done.

88
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,840
Chu Jinghong should've belonged to me.

89
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,400
She was my maidservant.

90
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:09,800
If you can't let me marry her,

91
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,319
can you please

92
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,280
stop her marriage with Uncle Thirteen?

93
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,240
I beg of you.

94
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,600
Fengxing.

95
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,720
Yes, Consort.

96
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:25,759
What?

97
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,639
Consort?

98
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:31,319
I'm not married yet.

99
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:32,680
Tomorrow...

100
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,399
To me,

101
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,920
you're the consort.

102
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,040
By the way,

103
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:39,879
where's His Highness?

104
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:40,480
His...

105
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,360
His Highness went to Jiuzhen Restaurant

106
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,240
to attend some business.

107
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,040
He will be back soon.

108
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,079
I see.

109
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:47,160
Please tell him

110
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,000
that I return to Suoqing Palace first.

111
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,040
I will see him...

112
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,279
tomorrow.

113
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:52,879
His Highness

114
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,560
has already summoned me

115
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,759
to escort you back.

116
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:56,360
Tonight,

117
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,920
I will guard at Suoqing Palace

118
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,560
to make sure nothing will happen.

119
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,240
Tomorrow,

120
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,319
someone will come

121
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,079
to dress you up.

122
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,040
My Lord.

123
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,120
Miss wants to see you

124
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,160
to speak about
something important with you.

125
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,120
I'm afraid

126
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,439
it's about my wedding tomorrow.

127
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,000
Fengxing.

128
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,160
Head to Jiuzhen Restaurant.

129
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,399
Yes.

130
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:49,879
Your Highness.

131
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:50,720
What's wrong?

132
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:51,639
Oh.

133
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:52,879
Nothing.

134
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,079
I just

135
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,399
want to see him now.

136
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:56,480
I see.

137
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:14,920
