Feibai.

Bao'er.

20
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,840
You shouldn't have come here now.

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,439
When should

22
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:19,439
I come then?

23
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,840
After you marry the princess of Northern Chu?

24
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,719
People think Ye Feibai is fake,

25
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:25,719
while Yu Longyuan is the real you.

26
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:27,480
But to me,

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,359
Ye Feibai is the genuine one.

28
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes.

29
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,200
I feel guilty for you all.

30
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,560
Your family is eliminated because of me.

31
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:36,200
I did promise

32
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:39,000
that I would find your foes

33
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,040
and avenge you.

34
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,200
The physician

35
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,760
that night

36
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,480
is Princess Jinghong, right?

37
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,799
Can you not marry her?

38
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,040
No.

39
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,560
If you were to marry her tomorrow,

40
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,120
I will let the entire capital know

41
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,599
that you're Ye Feibai.

42
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,840
Also, I will tell Princess Jinghong

43
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,920
that you've been deceiving her.

44
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,639
Fengxing.

45
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,599
What brings you here?

46
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:10,520
Hey.

47
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,199
Master Jin.

48
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,080
Master Mu.

49
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:13,800
We came here to seek His Highness.

50
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,439
Is His Highness here?

51
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,840
(His Highness
didn't come here today though.)

52
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,479
He came and arranged for the banquet.

53
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:24,919
He headed back

54
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:25,960
after making sure
everything was perfect.

55
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:29,680
I see.

56
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:30,879
All right.

57
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,400
Let's head back to Suoqing Palace.

58
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,599
See you, Your Highness.

59
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:34,479
Sure.

60
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,039
(Jiuzhen Restaurant)
Let's go.

61
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,639
(One misstep leads to another)

62
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,439
(and lies stack upon lies.)

63
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,159
(Had I been honest with her
from the beginning,)

64
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,879
(I wouldn't have put myself)

65
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,000
(in such a passive situation.)

66
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,400
My Lord.

67
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,039
This evening,

68
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:03,719
Princess Jinghong

69
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:04,759
came to seek you.

70
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,840
What did she say?

71
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,919
Nothing.

72
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,960
She left with Fengxing

73
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,400
upon knowing you weren't there.

74
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,280
If I can't marry her

75
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,879
tomorrow,

76
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,479
what should I do
to ask for her forgiveness?

77
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:21,560
You can't marry her?

78
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:23,960
This morning,

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,120
Ming Bao'er came to me.

80
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,199
Back then,

81
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,439
I went to Yunmeng for an investigation

82
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,759
as Ye Feibai

83
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:32,840
and was chased down.

84
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,919
It was the family of Ming Bao'er
who rescued me.

85
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:37,080
I owed too much to her family.

86
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,039
If you can't deal

87
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,000
with this fake identity well...

88
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,240
I'm too impatient.

89
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,560
I should propose to her

90
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,520
only after the dust settles.

91
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,639
Look at it now...

92
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,400
You can't think that way.

93
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,919
Before, you took her in

94
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,439
because you needed her.

95
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:01,680
But now

96
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,319
you need both of her help

97
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,120
and her heart.

98
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,439
My Lord.

99
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,439
You've already fallen for her.

100
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,160
What sound is that?

101
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:18,560
Fengxing.

102
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,519
Fengxing.

103
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,399
Consort.

104
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,279
I'm here.

105
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:23,399
What has happened

106
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,399
outside?

107
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,720
Rest assured.

108
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,199
It's all fine.

109
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,680
I will send out some scouts.

110
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,439
All right.

111
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,519
What sound is this?

112
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,519
Lord War's wedding

113
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,879
is going to be called off.

114
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:39,759
What's happening now?

115
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,639
This is the death knell of the palace.

116
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:44,959
Was it

117
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,800
done by Mother

118
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,000
to halt the wedding of Yu Longyuan
and Chu Jinghong?

119
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,120
In that case,

120
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,199
she will remain unmarried.

121
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,519
As long as she doesn't marry someone,

122
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:00,160
I stand a chance to win her over.

123
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,360
My Lord.

124
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,920
You reek of liquor.

125
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,480
Princess Jinghong

126
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,519
will find something out of this.

127
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,600
Empress Dowager passed on.

128
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,360
With nine death knells tolling,

129
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,680
wedding ceremonies must be canceled.

130
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,639
It's my fault.

131
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,839
I fail to fulfil the promise to her.

132
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,199
Who's Empress Dowager?

133
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,800
The empress of the late emperor.

134
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,639
She was confined in the cold palace

135
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,240
because of the princes
seized the throne.

136
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,079
It seems

137
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:48,959
the wedding will be called off.

138
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,560
You may leave.

139
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:03,399
I'm sorry about that.

140
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,360
Please don't say that.

141
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:07,600
It's not your fault.

142
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,160
It's a coincidence.

143
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,639
No, it's not.
