Let's go.

20
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:04,760
I didn't come to get you out
of here though.

21
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,879
Your...

22
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:09,239
Quit stammering. Eunuch Ye is here.

23
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,280
Please, Your Highness.

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,680
Are you here to visit me?

25
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,560
I have nothing to entertain you.

26
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,200
Come in.

27
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,239
Suit yourself.

28
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:30,400
You may leave.

29
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,280
Yes.

30
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,400
(What's wrong with me?
Why do I have feelings for a eunuch?)

31
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:45,840
What are you thinking about?

32
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:46,879
Nothing.

33
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,480
I released Chen Sanbiao that day

34
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,599
after you left.

35
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:54,000
Though he was weak,

36
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm very sure that he was alive.

37
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:00,000
Did you find anything fishy?

38
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,200
Do you

39
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,359
have foes

40
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,439
or

41
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,120
is there anyone

42
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:05,879
plotting against you?

43
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,439
No.

44
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:08,520
Why did you ask so?

45
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,759
Did this

46
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,680
cause trouble to
the Internal Activities Depot?

47
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,280
You're right.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,639
Chen Sanbiao is the fourth victim
being killed.

49
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,599
Oh.

50
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:20,520
My goodness.

51
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,479
In that case,

52
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,879
I should thank you

53
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,680
for not exposing the fact
that I went there before.

54
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,960
Otherwise, I can't deflect suspicion.

55
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:31,719
If you feel grateful to me,

56
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,639
why don't you show some sincerity?

57
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,599
You want me to investigate this?

58
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,800
You said

59
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,159
Ye Feibai went to interrogate that girl

60
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,360
in Jingzhao Prefecture?

61
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,719
Yes, Your Majesty.

62
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,039
Why?

63
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,360
Your Majesty.

64
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:51,680
Recently, there have been
frequent murder cases in the capital.

65
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,800
Jingzhao Prefecture couldn't solve it,

66
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,120
so they transferred the case
to the Internal Activities Depot.

67
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,240
Longyuan

68
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,240
do anything about this?

69
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,719
No, Lord War doesn't intervene
in the matter of Princess Jinghong.

70
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,960
In my humble opinion,

71
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,639
Lord War doesn't really care
about Princess Jinghong.

72
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,120
Are you sure?

73
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,840
The third victim,

74
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:15,560
a male.

75
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,280
Time of death is around 16 hours ago.

76
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,000
There's a needle mark behind his ear.

77
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,479
Look at this.

78
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:32,240
It's not about some monsters
sucking blood,

79
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,719
it's done by humans.

80
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,719
Can three tiny needle holes

81
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,919
drain the blood of a human?

82
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,439
Yes, it's feasible.

83
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:42,280
If the needle is hollow.

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,599
Besides,

85
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,039
the needle

86
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,599
is coated with blood thinners.

87
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,120
That's possible to drain off a human.

88
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,319
Can a needle

89
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,400
be hollow?

90
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:51,280
Yes.

91
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,280
What's this?

92
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,439
It's three.

93
00:03:59,039 --> 00:03:59,360
Three?

94
00:03:59,400 --> 00:03:59,719
Yes.

95
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,159
Is it written in this way?

96
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,080
Also,

97
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,960
these characters

98
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,400
look familiar,

99
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,199
but I can't really read them.

100
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:07,800
Oh.

101
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:08,919
Do you mean this?

102
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,280
It's the simplified writing.

103
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,400
Used in my hometown.

104
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,840
Ask me if you don't understand.

105
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:14,439
Sure.

106
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,959
I will send you back first.

107
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,160
As for your case,

108
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:20,279
I will put my men to investigate it.

109
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,959
Officials of Jingzhao Prefecture

110
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,720
won't annoy you again.

111
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,720
What are you staring at me?

112
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,160
You're so kind.

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,079
If it weren't for you...

114
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,040
If it weren't for your special identity,

115
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:45,439
I'd have been touched enough
to offer myself to you.

116
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,160
It's fine, anyway.

117
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,079
We can be besties too.

118
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,160
- Greetings, Princess Jinghong.
- Greetings, Princess Jinghong.

119
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,480
His Highness sent us to escort you.

120
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,879
Everything that happened here

121
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,439
will be taken care of.

122
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,639
Your Highness,

123
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,199
you shouldn't stay at this place.

124
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:08,920
That's right.

125
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:09,720
I wonder

126
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:12,519
where should I go if I can't stay here.

127
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,199
Yu Longyuan, answer me.

128
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,360
You only show up and
boss me around after I got released.

129
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,040
Am I someone trivial to you?

130
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,399
Your Highness.

131
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,360
What's up?

132
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,560
His Highness

133
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,720
has already returned home.

134
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:30,560
This sedan chair is for you.

135
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,480
No...no one is inside?

136
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,480
Let's talk about this after going back.

137
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,319
Yes, that's right.

138
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:41,079
Lord War misses you very much.

139
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,399
Otherwise, Ye Feibai wouldn't help you

140
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:44,519
for no reason.

141
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:45,319
Right?

142
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:45,879
Certainly.

143
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,800
His Highness didn't attend
the morning assembly.

144
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,160
That's right.

145
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,279
He has been waiting for you.

146
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,439
Hee-hee.

147
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,439

00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,959
But you only repay it once.

175
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,720
Two more left.

176
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,240
(Does he really want me
to hug him in return?)

177
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,319
(What actually is he thinking?)

178
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,560
But we're just two strangers.

179
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:20,959
Why should we hug each other?

180
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,639
Your...

181
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,319
Your Highness.

182
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,920
The Young Master of Medical City and
Young Master Jin have been waiting.

183
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,000
I know.

184
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,519
We've hugged twice.

185
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,480
Don't try to deny it.

186
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,199
15 minutes.

187
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:57,480
What?

188
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,120
Every hug

189
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,120
should last 15 minutes.

190
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:00,959
So, this doesn't count.

191
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:02,920
What?

192
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,240
Hugging

193
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,439
for 15 minutes?

194
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:06,639
This is too much to ask.

195
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:08,040
You're so bossy.

196
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,399
Do you want to reject me?

197
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,959
I hug you once when you beg me.

198
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,560
Give me a hug in return for my favor.

199
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,480
What do you think?

200
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,079
(He's an expert in flirting.)

201
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:21,399
Forget it.

202
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,519
I will obey this

203
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,439
since I need your help.

204
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,000
Well, then.

205
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,879
Hey, are you leaving already?

206
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,519
This is the fifth victim.

207
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,279
All that's left of the deceased
are their lifeless bodies,

208
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,759
drained of blood.

209
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:51,000
The place ahead of the crime scene
of the fifth victim.

210
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,440
Take me there.
Maybe we'll find something there.

211
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,399
Yes.

212
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,320
