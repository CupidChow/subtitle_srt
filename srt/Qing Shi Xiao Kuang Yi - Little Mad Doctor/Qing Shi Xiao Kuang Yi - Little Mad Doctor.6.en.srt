Why are you staring at me?

19
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,040
We can only be besties.

20
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,319
Look.

21
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,519
The murderer escaped.

22
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,280
Did you see his face?

23
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,840
I believe in him.

24
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,319
Lord War is a monster.

25
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,159
Lord War is the blood-sucking monster.

26
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:11,960
Oh.

27
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
Look who's there.

28
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,199
Oh, young lady.

29
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,360
Look at this dainty face

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,919
slender waist

31
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,960
and fair skin.

32
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,319
You have stolen

33
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,439
my thunder.

34
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,719
Master Hua.

35
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,400
Tonight isn't safe.

36
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,599
It's better to avoid lingering outside.

37
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,080
Until the culprit is captured,

38
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:37,680
all nights

39
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,479
are dangerous.

40
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,319
The murderer...

41
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,960
Let me escort you back.

42
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,360
Is it done?

43
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:55,360
I found it.

44
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,360
He will protect you

45
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,639
after you return.

46
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,599
Do you doubt him?

(Luzhe Abode)

48
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,479
Princess Jinghong.

49
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,240
Hold on.

50
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,759
I need to speak to His Highness.

51
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:28,680
His Highness has retired for the night.

52
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,719
Wake him up then.

53
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,520
No, I can't.

54
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,560
His Highness doesn't like
to be disturbed when he's resting.

55
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:40,680
Hmph!

56
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,280
What's the matter?

57
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,439
Have you

58
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,199
gone out tonight?

59
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,759
Did you cause trouble again?

60
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,639
Not me, it's you.

61
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,400
The serial killer in the capital
showed up tonight.

62
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,639
And he was spotted.

63
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,039
His face...

64
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,879
What's it?

65
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,479
His face

66
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,159
is a dead ringer for Yu Longyuan.

67
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,360
Now that someone spotted this face.

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,240
He can't get away with it

69
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,719
no matter what.

70
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,199
So, this is the trouble you made.

71
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,960
The murderer...

72
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,240
It wasn't me.

73
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:20,800
Wait.

74
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,600
Why aren't you anxious about this?

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,040
Someone is trying to frame you.

76
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,079
That day, you looked weak in the yard...

77
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,279
It's a mere Blood Curse by my foe.

78
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,560
But I'm not the murderer.

79
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:41,839
Blood Curse?

80
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,439
What's that?

81
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,560
Whoever is afflicted by the Blood Curse

82
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,360
will suffer excruciating pain

83
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,759
as if their meridians are severed

84
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,519
in the full-moon night.

85
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,639
Every move they take

86
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,360
is like devouring by bugs

87
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,040
and blood oozes out from every pore

88
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,480
making them look like a monster.

89
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,639
Your Majesty.

90
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,319
Very soon,

91
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,959
we're going to haul the net in.

92
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:11,639
Gosh.

93
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,759
I should get a solar-powered hairdryer.

94
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,439
This is tiresome.

95
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,480
What's a solar-powered hairdryer?

96
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:18,600
You!

97
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,600

98
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:22,920
Ah.

99
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,759
Answer me.

100
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,000
It's...

101
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:26,600
It's...

102
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,319
A local product in Northern Chu.

103
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:30,759

104
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,319
What are you doing?

105
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
You're lying.

106
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:33,879

107
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:34,720
I didn't.

108
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,519
I didn't lie.

109
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,720
Wait.

110
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,079

why Lord War remained unmarried

Yes.

00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:10,839
It's incurable.

150
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,240
You shouldn't give up.

151
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,279
Concerning your illness,

152
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,319
you should continue to take medicine.

153
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:17,120
Ah.

154
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,680
I take medicine when it relapses.

155
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,519
No, you should take medicine

156
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,839
even when it doesn't relapse.

157
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,439
Oh, right.

158
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,240
Apart from taking medicine,

159
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,839
you ought to do more exercise

160
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,480
to help enhance your immunity.

161
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,199
Also,

162
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,399
pay attention to your diet
for supplementary nutrition.

163
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,240
Hence,

164
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,319
you will become an attractive

165
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,480
Afterwards,

166
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm going to prepare you
some grilled kidneys.

167
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,160
Diet for supplementary nutrition?

168
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,720
Yes.

169
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:40,839
You heard it right.

170
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,920
Most importantly,

171
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,519
you need to make new friends,

172
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,439
especially with ladies.

173
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,519

176
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,759
I heard

177
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,199
that your mother was a doctress

178
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,560
before she became a concubine.

179
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,600
Did you learn these skills from her?

180
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,439
Yes.

181
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,560
Thanks to her guidance.

182
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,199
I'm very curious

183
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,319
about how could she teach you that

184
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,879
when she had died

185
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,560
in childbirth.

186
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,879
Was it in your dream

187
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,600
and did her soul come back to you?
