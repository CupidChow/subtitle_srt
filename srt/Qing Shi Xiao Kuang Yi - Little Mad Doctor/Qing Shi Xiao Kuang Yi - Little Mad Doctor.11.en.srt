Ye Feibai...

19
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:05,840
I'm so sorry.

20
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:07,079
Physician Chu.

21
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,920
Why do you come here?

22
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,959
You shouldn't break into here.

23
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,359
So uncouth.

24
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,760
Couldn't you knock on the door first?

25
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:15,799
Time-out.

26
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,040
Gosh.

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,120
Please accept your punishment.

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,040
Your Highness.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,599
What's wrong with you?

30
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:36,560
Hold still.

31
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:40,359
Miss.

32
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,920
Do you have any orders?

33
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:44,879
Nothing.

34
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,319
I just want to know

35
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,079
who

36
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:49,680
is that woman?

37
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,719
She is

38
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,359
a well-known

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,480
physician.

40
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:58,040
What makes this physician so special
that Feibai is so worried about her?

41
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,760
I haven't seen him carry a woman
besides myself.

42
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,519
Please convey to Feibai

43
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,200
that I will head to the capital
to meet him

44
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,639
if he isn't back
before the first light.

45
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,479
If he wants me to return to Yunmeng,

46
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:13,120
he must send me off personally.

47
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,719
Otherwise, I won't go back.

48
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,840
What has happened to you?

49
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,280
Are you feeling unwell?

50
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,520
I'm fine.

51
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:37,719
Please put me down.

52
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:45,680
I'm good.

53
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:46,080
Very good.

54
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,280
Well...

55
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,240
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,840
I didn't know you were...

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,599
No, we didn't.

58
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,560
I was helping her to apply the ointment

59
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,000
because she couldn't reach her back.

60
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,759
Huh?

61
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh.

62
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:01,719
I see.

63
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:04,520
Let's drop that.

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,599
What about you?

65
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,719
Didn't I tell you

66
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,719
to dress your wound within two days?

67
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,520
What's wrong with you?

68
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,520
You came all the way here

69
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,159
just because of my wound?

70
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:14,840
Yes.

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,560
Or else what?

72
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,520
I didn't know

73
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,800
you care about me

74
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,360
so much.

75
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,400
Do you mean

76
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,759
the current Chu Jinghong

77
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,919
isn't the same as the former one?

78
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,159
Before, Princess Jinghong

79
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,319
was clumsy and silly,

80
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,240
but now she has become scheming.

81
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,719
Besides, she deploys unusual skills

82
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,360
to beguile Lord War.

83
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,719
Is she

84
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,439
a monster?

85
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:46,719
Yes.

86
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,159
She must be a vixen.

87
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,360
Otherwise,

88
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,000
Lord War wouldn't
have been bewitched by her.

89
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,120
That's right.

90
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:54,919
She must've lied

91
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:55,960
and got everyone confused.

92
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,039
Besides, she propagated

93
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,240
that everyone is equal.

94
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,439
What should we do?

95
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,520
Princess Jinghong
is a skilled physician.

96
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,719
She offered treatments
without charge.

97
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,120
All right, you've recovered.

98
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,360
She's indeed

99
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,480
a healing immortal.

100
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,399
Healing immortal?

101
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,000
She is a bewitching monster.

102
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,959
She's not the Princess Jinghong

103
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,399
and her appearance is fake.

104
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:44,279
Remove the makeup if you dare.

105
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,040
Show everyone your real countenance.

106
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,360
Why dawdle?

107
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:49,279
Hurry up.

108
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,680
(Stupid Fengwu.)

109
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,279
(I was planning to have her
ruin Chu Jinghong's face.)

110
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,079
(Yet, she claimed
to expose her real appearance.)

111
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,759
I never know

112
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,879
Second Prince respects
your elder in this way.

113
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,439
No worries.

114
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:12,399
You will be all right.

115
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,319
(No way.)

116
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:37,879
Who are you?

117
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,600
You're not Chu Jinghong.

118
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,279
Who exactly are you?

119
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,079
Second Prince, please behave yourself.

120
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,959
She's a monster.

121
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,600
Otherwise, she wouldn't be so pretty.

122
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,920
She's a vixen

123
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,560
who came to beguile men.

124
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:55,959
This is hilarious.

125
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,399
Princess Fengwu.

126
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,959
Have you seen what I used
to look like before?

127
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,360
Or

128
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,480
did the Second Prince
who never paid me any attention,

129
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,839
see me with a bare face?

130
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,279
Since you haven't,

131
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,519
why are you accusing me
of being a monster?

132
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,920
Princess Fengwu,

133
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,319
you may perform an exorcism ritual.

134
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,399
You did that?

135
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,680
Fengxing.

136
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,240
Escort Princess Fengwu back.

137
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,199
She will never be allowed
to enter my residence again.

138
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,680
Yes.

139
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,360
Rongze.

140
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,120
Rongze.

141
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:26,879
Go.

142
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,600
(It turns out she has been
wearing disguised makeup.)

143
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,199
(And this is her real countenance.)

144
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:39,439
Jinghong, how do you know
so many unusual skills?

145
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,000
My Lord, they are products and customs
from my hometown.

146
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:47,920
I find the customs back in
my hometown very interesting.

147
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,879
If a man falls for a woman
and wants to marry her,

148
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,040
he has to propose marriage to her.

149
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,879
The man will propose on one knee

150
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,600
and place the engagement ring
on her finger.

151
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,160
If the man I like

152
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,079
were to propose to me,

153
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,839
I will be over the moon.

154
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,620
(Lord War's Residence)

155
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,199
My Lord.

156
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,639
Today is your birthday.

157
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,120
I made you

158
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:22,959
a birthday cake.

159
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,879
Make a wish.

160
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,399
Then,

161
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,560
blow out the candle.

162
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,600
Blow it out?

163
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,199
Yes.

164
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,940
♪At the end of the bustling world,
I met you♪

165
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:35,959
My Lord.

166
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,199
Happy birthday.

167
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,959
This is a new experience

168
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,240
for me.

169
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,519
I will celebrate your birthday

170
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,879
every year from now on.

171
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,279
Every year?

172
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:45,680
That's right.

173
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:48,639
Jinghong.

174
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,639
Let's get married
