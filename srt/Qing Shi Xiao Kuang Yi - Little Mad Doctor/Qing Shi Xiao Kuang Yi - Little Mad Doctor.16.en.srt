18
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,560
Chu Jinghong.

19
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:04,040
Is Northern Chu a poor state?

20
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,480
Presenting a plant as a birthday gift?

21
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:07,239
Your Majesty.

22
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:08,359
This is

23
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,120
the Queen of the Night.

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,599
The legend has it

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,920
that whoever

26
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,400
is able

27
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:16,760
to let it bloom,

28
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,280
the person will

29
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,920
bring great fortune to the empire.

30
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:20,879
Empress.

31
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:21,680
Why don't you give it a try?

32
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:23,159
It doesn't matter

33
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,319
whether the flower blooms or not.

34
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:27,079
Well, I shall try it.

35
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,840
Sure.

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,439
Consider it a pleasant interlude.

37
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,519
(Darned Chu Jinghong.)

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,760
(Do you mean I don't deserve
to be the empress)

39
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,480
(if the flowers don't bloom?)

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,200
You shall bloom now.

41
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,760
For the perpetual prosperity

42
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,519
of the Shang Empire.

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,480
(What's going on?)

44
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,040
(Come on.)

45
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,400
It seems the blooming

46
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,159
that brings prosperity to the empire

47
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,480
is but a legend.

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,640
No, no.

49
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:12,280
Since Princess Jinghong
is confident about this legend,

50
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:15,520
why don't you try this?

51
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,039
Bloom now.

52
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:25,000
Look, the flowers bloom.

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,360
They're blooming.

54
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,800
How beautiful.

55
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,400
This is amazing.

56
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,159
(Chu Jinghong.)

57
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,280
(Do you purposely embarrass me?)

58
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:51,120
(Why is it happening now?
It's not the time yet.)

59
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,800
(Is something wrong
with the liquor earlier?)

60
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,000
Your Majesty.

61
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,520
Since the bloom happened,

62
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,599
I shall

63
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:08,840
take my leave now.

64
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:10,759
Hold still.

65
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,919
Are you forcing me to stay?

66
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,599
I shall see

67
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,680
who's going to get in my way.

68
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,120
Longyuan.

69
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:25,919
I understand you don't intend to murder
for drinking human blood.

70
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:26,759
I

71
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,680
won't let you pay

72
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:28,639
with your life.

73
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,800
However,

74
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,479
you're a dangerous threat

75
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,439
to Shang.

76
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,879
What has Lord War got to do
with the murder?

77
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,000
Alas.

78
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,319
How unfortunate.

79
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,520
Though Longyuan fought enemies
to bring peace to the empire,

80
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:47,960
he was attacked by the Blood Curse
during the war.

81
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:48,719
The Blood Curse

82
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:49,840
is grotesque

83
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:50,960
as the cursed

84
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,319
needs human blood

85
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,560
to sustain their lives.

86
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,439
I know Longyuan did this out of despair.

87
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,719
But

88
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,520
I can't allow you

89
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,599
to slaughter my people.

90
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,280
Your Majesty.

91
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,919
Where did you hear this from?

92
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,560
You've been deceived.

93
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,759
You accuse me of being the murderer,

94
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,360
can you prove it?

95
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,560
Those afflicted with the Blood Curse

96
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,519
bleeds from every pore

97
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,319
during the full-moon night.

98
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,319
Do you dare

99
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:24,319
remove your clothes

100
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,920
and prove yourself?

101
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,199
If you said so.

102
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,160
No blood stains on him.

103
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,000
What's happening now?

104
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,519
I told you so.

105
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,759
Lord War can't be the murderer.

106
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,199
Lord War isn't that kind of person.

107
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,120
He wouldn't kill for his own sake.

108
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:43,480
Your Majesty.

109
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,040
The real culprit

110
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,360
has already been captured by Lord War.

111
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,199
We intended to report this.

112
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,839
However, it's ominous

113
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:52,040
to announce this

114
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,079
during your birthday banquet.

115
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,560
The culprit

116
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,199
used these three hollowed needles
coated with blood thinners

117
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,160
to drain the victims' blood.

118
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:02,680
Regarding this,

119
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,480
Director Ye and I have found the truth.

120
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,040
Your Majesty.

121
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,040
The serial killer was found

122
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,240
and he confessed to his crime.

123
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,040
This is the statement.

124
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,600
I shall take my leave.

125
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,720
Your Majesty.

126
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,079
May I go now?

127
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:39,680
Hyah!

128
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:41,560
Hyah!

129
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,160
My Lord.

130
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,920
Are you all right, My Lord?

131
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,879
My Lord.

132
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,800
Are you fine, My Lord?

133
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,360
(I must concoct the antidote
as soon as possible.)

134
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,439
How come the Blood Curse in Yu Longyuan

135
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,920
didn't flare up just now?

136
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,160
Well...

137
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,920
I did add the substance

138
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,319
that triggers the Blood Curse
in his drink.

139
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,879
Has he

140
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,680
found the method to break the poison?

141
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,240
Break the poison?

142
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,759
Didn't you say

143
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:28,160
this poison is hard to cure?

144
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,160
Perhaps

145
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:33,399
they only got to alleviate the pain.

146
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,079
Second Prince.

147
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,959
What's bothering you?

148
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,560
Why are you here?

149
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,639
I know you're annoyed

150
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:52,959
because of Chu Jinghong and Lord War.

151
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,800
They are deeply in love now.

152
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,639
It's difficult

153
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,000
to separate them.

154
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,519
But...

155
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,519
What's it?

156
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,519
But I have an idea.

157
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:18,399
This is so fun.

158
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,120
Oh?

159
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,120
Where's Jin'er?

160
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:21,839
Well.

161
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,959
She said the weather has grown colder.

162
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,160
She returned to Suoqing Palace

163
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,160
to fetch some thick clothes.

164
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,600
Please forgive me.

165
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,680
I wasn't paying attention
and accidentally bumped into you.

166
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,160
Please spare me, Your Highness.

167
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:39,959
Why are you calling me Your Highness

168
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,680
when you didn't even look at me?

169
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,120
What if

170
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,839
I'm a lowly person?

171
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,399
Lowly...person?

172
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,460
♪I sigh at my life♪

173

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,980
