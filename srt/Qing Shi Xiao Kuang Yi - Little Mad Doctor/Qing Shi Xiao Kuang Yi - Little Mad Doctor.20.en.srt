Jin'er.

How do you feel now?

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,359
Are you all right?

24
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,319
Your Highness.

25
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,640
I'm not asking for your forgiveness.

26
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,879
But please keep my child alive.

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,239
My child...

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,200
Jin'er.

29
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,439
Jin'er.

30
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,480
Finally, you come to me.

31
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,920
Why did you kill Jin'er?

32
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,079
Oh, no.

33
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,080
Please don't wrong me.

34
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,000
She just deserved it.

35
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,439
Do you really think

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,120
Yu Heng would allow a lowly servant
to give birth to his first child?

37
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,240
Besides, men have always had many wives.

38
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:21,199
It's a great fortune for Jin'er

39
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,120
for receiving grace from Yu Heng.

40
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,319
I just sent her

41
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,000
to where she should be.

42
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,960
She should appreciate my effort instead.

43
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,360
In that case, I shall thank you.

44
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,840
Appreciation alone might not be enough,

45
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,000
I...

46
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,319
You shouldn't kill her.

47
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,120
Why not?

48
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:43,759
Jin'er is dead

49
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,919
because of her.

50
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,039
My Lord.

51
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,199
My Lord, please save me.

52
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,879
This woman wants to kill me.

53
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,560
I belong to you

54
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:51,560
no matter dead or alive.

55
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:52,960
For you, I'm willing to...

56
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,919
My Lord.

57
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:55,719
Jinghong.

58
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:56,759
Let's go back.

59
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,599
Let's go.

60
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,879
Fine.

61
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,879
You just lucked out

62
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,439
to survive today.

63
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:06,840
Listen.

64
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,039
You won't be so lucky next time.

65
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,840
Jinghong.

66
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,159
It's nippy out here.

67
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,759
Let's go home.

68
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,400
Do you reckon

69
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,599
the life of a maidservant

70
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,280
insignificant

71
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,599
as if they are like lowly animals?

72
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,240
No, that's not what you thought.

73
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,759
You were impulsive today.

74
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,960
You shouldn't do that.

75
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,400
What should I do then?

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,560
Watching Jin'er and her child

77
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,919
die between my arms

78
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,759
and doing nothing?

79
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,680
Two lives just perished.

80
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,120
It's my fault.

81
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,360
I shouldn't have sent her
back to Yu Heng.

82
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,279
All of the consequences

83
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,399
were because of her own choice.

84
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
It's not related to you.

85
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:50,959
Yu.

86
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,720
Well done.

87
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,759
You will get

88
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,439

Something bad has happened!

109
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
Helan Ci has led Imperial Guard

110
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,959
to invade the mansion.

111
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,480
Princess Jinghong plotted to harm
the princess of Eastern Xia

112
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,160
within the territory of Shang,

113
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,839
which violated the laws of Shang.

114
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,360
Please inform Princess Jinghong

115
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,040
to follow us to the Supreme Court.

116
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,680
Why Imperial Guard come here

117
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,279
instead of the Supreme Court?

118
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,759
This incident has already alarmed

119
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,639
His Majesty and Eastern Xia's royalties.

120
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,040
Truth be told,

121
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,399
due to the attack on Princess Liangyu,

122
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,199
Eastern Xia is preparing
to send troops to Northern Chu.

123
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,839
If Shang manages
to handle this properly,

124
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,519
perhaps the war between the two empires
could be avoided.

125
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:58,240
If not,

126
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,279
I'm afraid

127
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:01,199
there would be blood.

128
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,600
It turns out Wen Liangyu deliberately
approached Princess Jinghong

129
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,199
to give Eastern Xia a chance

130
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,519
to mobilize troops towards
Northern Chu.

131
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,360
Besides, Eastern Xia

132
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,199
is thousands of miles away
from the capital of Shang.

133
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,920
How did they get to know

134
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,160
soon after that incident happened?

135
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,759
Do you think we're dense?

It doesn't matter when did
they find out about this.

137
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,040
It matters

138
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,519

139
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:24,199
did harm Wen Liangyu

with absolute evidence.
