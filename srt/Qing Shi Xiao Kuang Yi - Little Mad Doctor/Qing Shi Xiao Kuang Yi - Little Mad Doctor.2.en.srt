I thought the pain

shouldn't be over so soon.

Yu Longyuan is too impatient.

00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,000

even though he likes me.

42
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,680
Why did he have to be so rude?

43
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,520
What was wrong with him just now?

44
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:25,919

Why are you trying

48
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,680
to catch my attention?

49
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:59,719
I'm starting to find you interesting,
I must admit.

50
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,000
You have a new patient now.

51
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,159
Only four hours left for treatment.

52
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,479
Please perform your duty now.

53
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,879
If you turn down this task,

54
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,680
you're going to face punishment.

55
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,680
The duty of physicians
is to help the sick.

56
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,879
Punishment is just frivolous.

57
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:30,479
3 hours and 58 minutes left.

58
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,480
(Internal Activities Depot)

59
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,520
Is the patient here?

60
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,199
It's Internal Activities Depot, the most
tightly guarded intelligence agency.

61
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,039
Governed by Ye Feibai,

62
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,280
commonly known as the Devil Ye.

63
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,360
The sole one
who stands toe to toe with him

64
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,680
is Lord War, Yu Longyuan.

65
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,919
You better be careful.

66
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,599
He's just a eunuch.

67
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,759
Is he really that strong?

68
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,520
I would like to meet with him then.

69
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,519
No one is allowed

70
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,759
to enter Internal Activities Depot.

71
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,120
Princess Jinghong.

72
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,240
Step back, please.

73
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,279
So, you're Eunuch Ye?

74
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:28,480
Eunuch Ye.

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,839
I would like to meet someone.

76
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,000
Please do me this favor.

77
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,759
Why should I do it for you?

78
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,040
Not me,

79
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,759
it's for Lord War.

80
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,759
Lord War summoned me here.

81
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:39,839
Oh?

82
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,639
Lord War asked you here?

83
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:42,600
Yes.

84
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,920
Do you think he will buy
this clumsy lie?

85
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,759
I see.

86
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,800
I shall show respect

87
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,360
to Lord War.

88
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,600
Well.

89
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,959
Please, Your Highness.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,360
Sure.

91
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,759
(She seems to be familiar
with the dungeon.)

92
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:14,839
Eunuch Ye.

93
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:15,920
May I go in?

94
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,439
Yes.

95
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:20,680
Eunuch Ye.

96
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:21,800
It won't take long.

97
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,879
It's you?

98
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:35,319
Physician isn't entitled
to choose the patient.

99
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,040
Fine.

100
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:39,240
Physicians are always
expected to be benevolent.

101
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,319
You just lucked out

102
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,439
to encounter me here.

103
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,079
How do you feel now?

104
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:45,160
Please give me a quick death.

105
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,240
Jiu.

106
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,240
I need

107
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,160
a surgical mask,

108
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:48,839
hemostat

109
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,680
and high-frequency electric scalpel.

110
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,360
I don't have them.

111
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,079
No?

112
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,079
Only basic medical instruments
will be provided.

113
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,319
Dive into the medical column in
the bracelet using your consciousness

114
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
and retrieve the instruments you need.

115
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,439
Luckily, the equipment is
fairly complete.

116
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,079
(I haven't seen those pieces
of equipment before.)

117
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,680
Princess Jinghong.

118
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,160
I will come clean.

119
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,360
I don't have any interest in that.

120
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,199
Take this medicine.

121
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:33,959
It's done.

122
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,879
Princess Jinghong.

123
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:58,800
Is it done?

124
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,560
Yes.

125
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,399
Thank you for your help.

126
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:02,360
Don't mention it.

127
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,160
