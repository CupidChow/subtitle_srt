Was it in your dream

19
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,719
or did your mother's soul
come back to you?

20

Erm...

21
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:09,120
It's

22
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:09,920
the medical book

23
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,040
and her notes.

24
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,079
Yes.

25
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:12,640
Something like

26
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:13,239
transcript.

27
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:13,840
Well... transcript...

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,840
The notes and transcript
left by my mother.

29
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,640
I learn them by myself.

30

I'll go and make you
some grilled kidneys.

(Lord War's Residence)

33
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,719
Ling'er, does it smell good?

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,680
Your Highness.

35
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:42,640
What's this?

36
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:43,439
It smells very good.

37
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,040
Well.

38
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,599
This is...

39
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,760
Oh.

40
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,239
It's not for you today.

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,599
I will make you
some grilled pork brain next time.

42
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,560
What are you doing here?

43
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm grilling the kidneys for you.

44
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:03,400
I have already proposed marriage
to Northern Chu.

45
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,719
What?

46
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:08,759
Why do you look so surprised?

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,240
Didn't you say

48
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,479
that we're not a married couple?

49
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,800
From today on, we're a married couple.

50
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,039
(What kind of reasoning is this?)

51
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:19,240
(How can he start counting from today?)

52
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,759
Rongze.

53
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,919
Why are you here?

54
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,919
I've been looking for you.

55
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:25,680
Fengwu.

56
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,439
What brings you here?

57
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,800
We're having a gathering two days later.

58
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,719
I'd like to invite you over.

59
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,879
Oh, Princess Jinghong.

60
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,280
You're here too.

61
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,439
Why don't you

62
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,479
join us too?

63
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,280
Sure.

64
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,560
Rongze.

65
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,919
You will

66
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,199
attend the gathering,

67
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,439
right?

68
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:58,840
Yes.

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,759
How good of you.

70
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:00,520
If so,

71
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,080
I will get going.

72
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,479
I heard that Longyuan will attend

73
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,639
to the banquet held by Fengwu.

74
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:14,400
Yes.

75
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,319
The banquet

76
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,680
is on the night of the full moon.

77
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:25,599
Your Highness.

78
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,639
I will get you a good spot.

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,240
Are you blind?

80
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,000
Feiyu.

81
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,520
Mind your language.

82
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,560
You shouldn't simply beat
a dog with an owner.

83
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,680
What have you done?

84
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,240
Stop staring at me.

85
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:46,719
I never care

86
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,039
who's the owner of the dog.

87
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,120
Are you insane, Chu Jinghong?
How dare you beat me?

88
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:52,240
Aren't you afraid
Northern Chu will be wiped out?

89
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:53,840
Wiped out?

90
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,319
Princess Feiyu, are you implying

91
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
that South Qin

92
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,400
stands beyond

93
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,120
the other three empires?

94
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,599
Such audacity, princess of South Qin.

95
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,199
Chu Jinghong.

96
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,800
Don't you slander me.

97
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,080
Did I?

98
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,159
I have no idea about
the strength of South Qin.

99
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:14,680
However, Princess Feiyu

100
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,960
seems to be capable

101
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,079
of taking over the throne.

102
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,040
No.

103
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm not.

104
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,120
I didn't mean that.

105
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:25,000
Here comes Lord War.

106
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,279
Here comes Princess Fengwu.

107
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,759
This is a private gathering.

108
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,040
Please drop the honorifics.

109
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,040
I would like to take this chance

110
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,879
to engage with you all

111
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,279

Fengwu.

113

You sure have a lot of respect.

114
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,360
It's the first time

115
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,319
that Lord War

116
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,680
joins young folks like us
in the gathering.

117

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,680
Please don't make fun of me.

119
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:07,959
My consort,

120
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,240

122
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,199
Are you angry because I come late?

Hey.

124
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,319
They are seeing us.

125
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,040
Why are you mad?

126
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,199
I'm not mad at you.

127
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,959
Please don't let me

128

sully your couple costumes.

There's more

175
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,800
to come.

176
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,319
My Lord.

177
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:04,959
My Lord.

178
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,519
Hug me.

179
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,120
My Lord.

180
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,600
You're truly a devoted woman.

181
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,839
But throughout history,

182
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,439
women love faithfully while men betray.

183
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:22,959
Young lady,

184
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,079
you better not simply give
your heart to someone.

185
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,360
Why did you save me?

186
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,680
I don't think it's enjoyable
to talk to you

187
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,039
while you're holding a man in your arms.

188
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,519
Instead, I would prefer
if you sat within my embrace.

189
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,200
So that we can talk

190
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,279
all night long.
