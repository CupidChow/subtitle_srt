18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,079
Wushuang.

19
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,480
Any word about His Highness?

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,239
Yes.

21
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:07,359
Northern Chu won against Eastern Xia
with the help of His Highness.

22
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,840
Hence, Hua Nongying, the crown prince
hold a banquet to appreciate his effort

23
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,560
and invited him to travel
in Northern Chu for a day or two.

24
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:14,000
His Highness will be back in no time.

25
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:15,799
He seems to enjoy having fun there

26
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,040
instead of coming back for you quickly.

27
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:21,079
(Yu Longyuan can't wait
to return earlier,)

28
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,879
(how could he have the mood
to go sightseeing?)

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,159
(Wushuang's lie)

30
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,760
(is so clumsy.)

31
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,400
Well.

32
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:31,760
I get it.

33
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,280
All right.

34
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,140
(One month later)

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,879
It's been two hours

36
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,079
and the sky is bright now.

37
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:47,640
Why are you still standing here?

38
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:48,560
Your...

39
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:49,680
Your Highness.

40
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,079
Princess Jinghong

41
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,319
didn't allow us in.

42
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,040
We dare not defy her order.

43
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:58,879
Jinghong.

44
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,680
Open the door.

45
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,319
A mere wooden door

46
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,879
can't keep you out though.

47
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,920
Why pretend to knock?

48
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,599
Jinghong.

49
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:19,000
Are you not satisfied
with what I did for you?

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,919
Have I ever mistreated you

51
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,240
over the past month?

52
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,520
Why can't you be compliant

53
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,560
since you've already agreed
on our marriage?

54
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,400
You're wrong.

55
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,319
I never agreed on this with you,

56
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,199
but with Her Majesty.

57
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,199
Besides,

58
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,719
it's on one condition.

59
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,639
Have you

60
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,960
made up your mind?

61
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,439
I will marry Yu Heng.

62
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,520
But I must meet Lord War before that.

63
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,199
All right.

64
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,159
You never had any intention
of marrying me.

65
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,280
You're not going to put the gown on
and proceed marriage ritual

66
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,439
before Uncle Thirteen shows up.

67
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,879
But if he comes,

68
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,639
you will leave with him
without hesitation.

69
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:25,560
Yes, I will.

70
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,000
You get that right.

71
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,479
I never wanted to marry you.

72
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,159
You forced me to.

73
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,719
This is merely a deal

74
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,280
between Her Majesty and me.

75
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,439
Why?

76
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,520
As the empress of this empire,

77
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,360
is she going to renege on her word?

78
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,159
If I don't get to see Lord War

79
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,039
today,

80
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,039
no one could force me to get married.

81
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,000
Unless you want to
marry to a dead body.

82
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,120
Jinghong.

83
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,319
Your Highness,

84
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,639
instead of wasting our time here

85
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,879
and miss out on the auspicious time,

86
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,759
why don't you persuade Her Majesty

87
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,960
to make good on that promise?

88
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,560
Otherwise, I'm going to do something

89
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,759
that's way beyond

90
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:09,719
you can imagine.

91
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,400
This is ridiculous, Chu Jinghong!

92
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,240
At this rate,

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,319
aren't you going to submit to your fate?

94
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,399
Your Majesty.

95
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,040
Where's Lord War?

96
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,120
Do you immediately put on
your wedding gown

97
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:25,800
and get married

98
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,480
as soon as you see Longyuan?

99
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,040
Yes.

100
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,279
I will get married
right after I make sure

101
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,360
Lord War's still alive.

102
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,600
Hmph!

103
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,279
Come with me.

104
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,439
Yu Longyuan.

105
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,319
I brought you here

106
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,480
not to see you clingy to him.

107
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,680
You can see him clearly

108
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,959
from here.

109
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,560
Yu Longyuan.

110
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,360
Yu Longyuan, wake up.

111
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:29,439
Jinghong.

112
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:30,879
Calm down.

113
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,519
Chu Jinghong.

114
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:35,120
You've seen him already.

115
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,000
If you keep stalling,

116
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I will send him to his demise.

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,759
Yu Longyuan.

118
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,120
I want to confirm

119
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,800
whether he's alive or not.

120
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,360
Hmph!

121
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,920
Fine.

122
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,000
I shall show you

123
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,240
whether or not he's alive.

124
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,199
No.

125
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:00,920
No.

126
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,920
Don't choke him.

127
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,160
Don't choke him.

128
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,519
Don't choke him.

129
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,360
Chu Jinghong.

130
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,079
Are you going to put
on the wedding gown?

131
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,360
Yes, I will.

132
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,360
Men.

133
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,560
Assist the Second Princess Consort

134
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:16,199
to get changed.

135
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:17,399
Hmph!

136
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,480
I believe

137
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,519
that one day,

138
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,439
you will put on the golden armor

139
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,319
riding on iridescent clouds

140
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,720
to marry me

141
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:33,680
with the blessings from the people.

142
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,720
First bow to Heaven and Earth.

143
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,000
Oh my.

144
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,800
Princess Jinghong

145
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,680
must be very nervous.

146
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,839
She forgets to bow.

147
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,319
Come on.

148
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,000
Assist her.

149
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

150
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,199
Be cooperative

151
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,839
if you don't wish
to see Lord War suffers.

152
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,560
Second bow to the parents.

153
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,639
Bow to each other.

154
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,680
(His Highness has been missing
for over a month.)

155
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,439
(If he were to fall in the hand
of the empress,)

156
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,160
(she would surely torture him.)

157
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,360
(The man in the prison
is with a flawless and clear face.)

158
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,680
(Though he passed out,)

159
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,439
(his face doesn't show
a sign of weakness.)

160
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:40,360
(Probably the man in the prison
isn't Lord War.)

161
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,240
Chu Jinghong.

162
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,240
What are you up to?

163
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,000
I

164
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,600
am not

165
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:51,639
marrying him.

166
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:54,680
Jinghong.

167
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,839
Only the last bow left.

168
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,000
I, Chu Jinghong,
the princess of  Northern Chu

169
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,399
am already betrothed to Lord War.

170
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,040
Yet,

171
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,680
the Empress of this empire

172
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,639
holds Lord War hostage

173
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:10,240
