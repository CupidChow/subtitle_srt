(Yu Heng, Second Prince)
Jinghong.

21
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:09,239
Uncle Thirteen won't come back.

22
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,319
We should complete the wedding bows now.

23
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,599
I'm

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,480
not

25
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,359
marrying you.

26
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:19,079
Jinghong.

27
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,400
She's my woman.

28
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,719
How dare you lay fingers on her?

29
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,180
(Yu Longyuan, Lord War of Shang Empire)

30
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:54,280
I'd never expected
we would part in this way.

31
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,640
During the past 120 days in this world,

32
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,599
(I've been very happy.)

33
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:03,319
(I will never forget the scene
when I first met you.)

34
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,680
(However, I don't belong
to this time-space.)

35
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,360
(If there were a next life,)

36
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,439
I will stay by your side.

37
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,479
(Somehow I feel reluctant)

38
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,919
(when I'm about to leave this world.)

39
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,319
(120 days ago,)

40
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,000
(I came here)

41
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,120
(from another world.)

42
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,860
(120 days ago)

43
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,940
(Jianghai Medical University)

44
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,680
The exam begins now.

45
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:37,159
All of you are the future surgeon,

46
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,080
please do your best in the exam.

47
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,600
(Matched)

48
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,020
(The assessment starts soon.)

49
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,319
What's this place?

50
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,000
Why am I here?

51
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,879
The assessment of Elseworld
commences now.

52
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,039
What's it?

53
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,520
I'm Jiu, the world's sprite.

54
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,439
Your current identity is
Princess Jinghong of the Northern Chu Empire.

55
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,800
To seek protection
from the Shang Empire,

56
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,960
Northern Chu offered Princess Jinghong
to Shang's royalties

57
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,120
for selection.

58
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,560
Hence, Princess Jinghong
deliberately disfigured her face

59
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,120
to avoid the humiliation
of being chosen.

60
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,800
As a result, she was stripped
of her nobility due to her ugly face.

61
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,800
I need a study companion.

62
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,039
She was then chosen by Yu Heng,
the Second Prince as a study companion.

63
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:27,879
You're chosen.

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,280
(Yuan Feiyu, South Qin Empire)

65
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,000
Yuan Feiyu, who's secretly in love
with Yu Heng is bratty and willful.

66
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,759
She's particularly resentful of Jinghong
and always frames against her.

67
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:36,560
Are you satisfied

68
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,080
with this character?

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,280
Satisfied, my foot.

70
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,879
What's this place?

71
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,719
Send me back immediately.

72
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,879
If you stay here a full 120 days

73
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,599
to provide medical treatment
and accumulate credits

74
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,479
to pass the assessment, you can go back.

75
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,719
120 days? Isn't that too long?

76
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:52,039
If you fail to complete the assessment
within the time set,

77
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,680
you have to stay in this world forever.

78
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,039
Hope you enjoy this.

79
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,560
No way, I'm in another world?

80
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,439
This place seems to be nice.

81
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,000
Healing the sick

82
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,040
is just a piece of cake.

83
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:20,600
Jinghong.

84
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,079
Finally, I got you here.

85
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,399
Please don't leave me again.

86
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:24,920
Chu Jinghong.

87
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,120
What are you doing?

88
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,879
This is Yu Heng, the Second Prince.

89
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,600
I know.

90
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,040
Look at his dashing face.
Why must he be a bad guy?

91
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:37,079
Chu Jinghong.

92
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,839
How shameless you are.

93
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,879
How could you date an unknown guy

94
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,040
in the public?

95
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,519
(So, this is Yuan Feiyu?)

96
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,439
(Framing me to date such an ugly guy?)

97
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,120
(What a dolt.)

98
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,800
Normally, characters like such

99
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,319
can't survive more than five episodes.

100
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,000
Hey.

101
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,680
Did you see me dating him
with your own eyes?

102
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,079
Gosh.

103
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:01,439
Jinghong.

104
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,720
This is the love token you gave me.

105
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:07,079
I still carry it with me.

106
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,160
Isn't this hairpin

107
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:12,439
you always wear?

108
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,959
No wonder I didn't see you
wearing it these days.

109
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,959
Oh, this is my hairpin.

110
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:20,720
It's nice.

111
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,399
Pink colour.

112
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:24,759
My Lord.

113
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,480
We should go back now.

114
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:31,240
The Blood Curse inside you is soon
relapsing. If we don't go back...

115
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,319
(Why do I feel a sense of weirdness
when I see her?)

116
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,160
Be careful.

117
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,600
(What a cliche and tacky)

118
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,920
("saving damsel in distress" scene.)

119
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,480
How long are you going to stare at me?

120
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,120
My Lord.

121
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,920
- Greetings, My Lord.
- Greetings, My Lord.

122
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:15,959
What's going on here?

123
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:17,480
Uncle Thirteen.

124
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,240
My study companion has caused a hassle.

125
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,040
Bring her away.

126
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:24,360
Did Jinghong offend you?

127
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,040
Please hand her over to me.

128
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,120
I will

129
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,600
punish her heavily.

130
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,240
She stole my thing.

131
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,600
I'm going to take her back
for interrogation.

132
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:35,319
(This reason seems pretty farfetched.)

133
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,800
(He's bossy.)

134
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,480
(I like it though.)

135
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,879
May I ask what did she steal?

136
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:41,000
Since she's my study companion,

137
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,639
I'm willing

138
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:42,759
to compensate for her.

139
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:43,480
Good.

140
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:44,560
Ten thousand silver taels.

141
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,480
I will look after your study companion
for some days first.

142
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:49,560
Besides,

143
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,360
I don't like others

144
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,879
intervening in my business.

145
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:56,759
Go now.

146
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
According to the scout,

147
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:05,319
on the 15th of every month,

148
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:06,040
all guards around Lord War's chamber

149
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,160
will be dismissed.

150
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,639
Stick with the plan.

151
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,319
Yes.

152
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,120
Chu Jinghong.

153
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,240
Please don't blame me.

154
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,879
I shall give you a shove

155
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,160
since you've entered
Lord War's Residence.

156
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,360
Trespassing on Lord War's chamber
is a fatal crime.

157
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,600
(Lord War's Residence)

158
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,759
Why did Lord War confine me here?

159
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,519
I'm the woman of the new era.

160
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,319
I'm independent,

161
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:35,959
tough,

162
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,600
confident,

163
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,199
cute

164
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,439
and pretty.

165
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,560
Maybe he's in love with me.

166
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,759
After all, pretty girls garner favor
wherever they go.

167
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,399
Jeez, these freckles

168
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,240
hinder my radiant beauty.

169
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,959
Ah!
