Your Highness. It's my fault.

41
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,000
Why did you do that?

42
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:08,639
Your Highness.

43
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,919
I'm willing to die for what I did.

00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,680
please allow me

before I die.

47
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,120
Child?

48
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,360
Please spare my child.

49
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,360
Its life

50
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,039
depends on

51
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,800
the answer you give.

52
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,240
Your Highness.

53
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,400
I didn't know the intention
of Second Prince.

54
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,680
He only told me

55
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,159
to bring you to the lantern festival

56
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:42,199
as to ruin your marriage and that's all.

57
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,240
That's all?

58
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,319
I didn't know

59
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,360
my marriage

60
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,879
values so little to you.

61
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,840
I've never pegged you
and Ling'er as maids.

62
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,159
Is our relationship for years

63
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:04,680
not worth more than a man's sweet words?

64
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,080
Your Highness.

65
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,599
I'm to blame.

66
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,159
Please spare the child inside me.

67
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,879
Go and pack up.

68
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:16,279
I will have someone send you
to Second Prince.

69
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:20,079
Your Highness.

70
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,519
I'm just a physician

71
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,160
and I avert killings

72
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,800
with no reason.

73
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,839
But I'm not a sage either.

74
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:38,199
After you step out of this door,

75
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,120
that's the end

76
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,079
of our bond.

77
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,519
Wish you a better life.

78
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,000
This is the path you chose.

79
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,639
Your Highness.

80
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,480
I've dreamt of a world.

81
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,160
In that world,

82
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,000
everyone is born equal.

83
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,360
They don't have to suffer mistreatment
from evil powers

84
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,160
or bow down

85
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,639
to the lofty emperors and royalties.

86
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,040
Everyone their lives with dignity.

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,800
My Lord.

88
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,959
I don't like this time travel at all.

89
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,920
Why am I arranged

90
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,279
to experience such a tacky plot?

91
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:31,199
I wish I'm free to make choices
for my life

92
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,240
and do anything

93
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,360
I like.

94
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,560
Even if

95
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,240
I have to live in seclusion

96
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,560
and by humble fare.

97
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,040
As long as I'm with you.

98
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,879
It's way better than this dramatic life.

99
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,079
What brings you here?

100
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,279
This

101
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,480
is

102
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,600
the lotus seed sweet soup

103
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,759
made by Jiuzhen Restaurant.

104
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:29,959
Please eat this.

105
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,560
Why are your hands trembling?

106
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,959
No, I don't.

107
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:33,720
Eat this.

108
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,680
Do you like me?

109
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:47,120
Ah?

110
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,959
I...

111
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,439
Look over there.

112
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:10,959
Why do you ask to see me

113
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,040
so hurriedly?

114
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,920
I'm shy.

115
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,720
Maybe you tell him.

116
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,360
You tell him.

117
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:24,360
You.

118
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,879
You can't let a lady do this.

119
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,040
If none of you is going to say,
I'm leaving.

120
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:31,879
Hey.

121
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:32,759
I will say this.

122
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,000
Bao'er and I are in a relationship now.

123
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,920
You

124
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,920
are in a relationship?

125
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,720
If so,

126
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,120
that's good.

127
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:46,519
Great.

128
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,759
Is that a yes from you?

129
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,040
Bao'er is a good lady.

130
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,920
You ought to treat her well.

131
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:53,959
If you fail her,

132
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,319
I won't let you off the hook.

133
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,639
Feibai.

134
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,360
Wushuang said I'm his only wife.

135
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,319
He won't take in concubines.

136
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,120
Wait.

137
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,319
I didn't promise that.

138
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,240
Wushuang.

139
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,360
I didn't know you're so devoted.

140
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,079
I will remember what you promised.

141
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,480
We'll take about this later.

142
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,120
Feibai.

143
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,240
We will leave then.

144
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,680
Show yourself.

145
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,480
What a lovely family.

146
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:29,360
What brings you here, Master Hua?

147
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,319
Is it boring to stay in Yunyu Parlor

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,240
and you want to experience the dungeon
of Internal Activities Depot?

149
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,240
No, I don't.

150
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,039
It's just

151
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,120
that I found something interesting.

152
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,799
I'd like to share it with you.

153
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,200
Go on.

154
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,720
Should I address you Director Ye

155
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,559

156
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,639
