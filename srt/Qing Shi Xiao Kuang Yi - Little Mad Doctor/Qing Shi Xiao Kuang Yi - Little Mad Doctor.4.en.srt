Greetings, My Lord.

20

(Why is he here?)

21
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,120
(Drat!)

22

00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,480
(what I said just now?)

00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:12,400
(I'm going to lose face)

25
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,920
(if he were to undermine me.)

26

Didn't you hear me?

27
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:22,159
Yuan Feiyu.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,959
His Highness is asking you.

29
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:25,400
What has happened that day

30
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,000
and now?

31
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,560
Why don't you tell us?

32
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,200
I

33
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,480
have nothing

34
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,200
to do with Jinghong.

35
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:36,519
Good.

36
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,359
(This woman)

37
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,879
(isn't as naive as she appears.)

38
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:01,280
(How should I deal with this situation?)

39
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:08,759
We're even now.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,759
I didn't expect

41
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,919
such an amusing scene
as soon as I return to the capital.

42
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:34,400
Sese.

43
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:35,400
Yes.

44
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,520
(Hua Nongying)
Go and prepare the Queen of the Night.

45
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,120
Master Hua.

46
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,000
Are you planning to...

47
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,400
(Yun Sese)
Sorry, I'm out of line.

48
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:42,560
I will prepare for it now.

49
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,400
How is it?

50
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,280
What?

51
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,000
My Qinggong skill.

52
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:04,879
Oh.

53
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,039
Very good.

54
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,039
Excellent.

55
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,319
You were like riding on the clouds.

56
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,520
It was a fast and stable ride.

57
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,319
Marvelous.

58
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,319
Two times.

59
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,439
Two times?

60
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,680
I've helped you two times.

61
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,479
Thank you for saving me,

62
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,000
My Lord.

63
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,560
How will you thank me?

64
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,719
(Why would I know that?)

65
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,000
(In romance novels, the beauty
will offer herself to the hero)

66
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,520
(after being saved by the hero.)

67
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,840
(Don't tell me...)

68
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:34,199
What do you expect in return?

69
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,960
Northern Chu isn't an affluent empire.

70
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,280
I'm not asking for money.

71
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,319
(Not asking for money?)

72
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,759
(Is he going to ask for me?)

73
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,080
Just say it.

74
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,639
I will repay anything I can...

75
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,639
A hug.

76
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,479
Hug?

77
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,719
(Did I hear that right?)

78
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,960
(Yu Longyuan is actually
asking for hugs?)

79
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:56,960
(My Lord.)

80
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:59,039
(You're behaving out of character.)

81
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,240
Since you want to repay my kindness,

82
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,680
giving me a hug

83
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:04,639
is the best way.

84
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,960
(Oh, my.)

85
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,120
(He actually flirts at me)

86
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,199

00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,600
Also, I have sent someone to bring back

your things left on the street.

101

come to fetch us?

rumbles.

106
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,319
Romance novels here

107
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,480
isn't heartbreaking

and sweet enough.

109
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,600
Ling'er.

110
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,920
How to pronounce this word?

111
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,680
This word...

112
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,399
I don't know either.

113
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:17,480
Princess Jinghong.

114
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:18,920
Someone from Jingzhao Prefecture came.

115
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,240
They claimed that you're related
to a murder case.

116
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:21,879
What?

117
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,120
Is Yuan Feiyu dead already?

118
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,639
(So, this is Yuan Feiyu?)

119
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,360
Normally, characters like such

120
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,879
can't survive more than five episodes.

121
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,800
It can't be. It's only the fourth one.

122
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,079
Where's Lord War?

123
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,600
Shisan.

124
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,519
You're turning 25

125
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,040
after the Double Ninth Festival.

126
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,759
(Emperor Zhaowu,)
You should start considering

127
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,560
(the monarch of the Shang Empire)
to get a consort.

128
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,680
Out of the four girls,
East, West, South and North,

129
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,199
which one do you prefer?

130
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,680
I will ask the empress

131
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,720
to choose based on your liking.

132
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:56,240
What do you say?

133
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,680
Your Majesty.

134
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,319
Thanks for the game.

135
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,639
You're the only one I can't beat.

136
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,360
My little brother

137
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,560
never shows respect

138
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:14,759
to me.

139
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,199
By the way,

140
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,399
regarding Chu Jinghong of Northern Chu,

141
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,160
is the information correct?

142
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,439
Yes.

143
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:23,560
Many people

144
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,720
witnessed

145
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,959
Lord War

146
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,160
brought her back

147
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,319
from the street that day.

148
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,240
If Longyuan really cares about her,

149
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,879
send that woman

150
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,519
to him, then.

151
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,720
(Zhao Changqing,)
Princess Jinghong.

152
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,399
(Governor of Jingzhao Prefecture)
How come your handkerchief

153
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,879
appeared in the hand of Chen Sanbiao?

154
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,480
Sir.

155
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,399
The owner of the handkerchief
isn't the thing we should look into.

156
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:56,160
You should find that murderer first.

157
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,240
It's normal

158
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,079
for one to lose their handkerchief.

159
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,959
Do you mean

160
00:06:59,199 --> 00:06:59,839
your handkerchief

161
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,680
was stolen by Chen Sanbiao?

162
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,920
Maybe he picked it somewhere.

163
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,120
The thing is

164
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,560
he was killed

165
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,399
right after he slandered you.

166
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,800
This is rather odd.

167
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:10,959
Perhaps divine justice

168
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,199
is manifested.

169
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,600
Chu Jinghong.

170
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,079
Don't beat around the bush with me.

171
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:18,920
Let me ask you this.

172
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,279
What were you doing

173
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,319
last night?

174
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,600
Last night,

175
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,839
I was sleeping in Lord War's Residence.

176
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,360
Sleep?

177
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:28,920
Do you have witnesses?

178
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,360
Lord War can testify to this.

179
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:32,759
Quit your nonsense.

180
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,079
Why would Lord War watch you sleep

181
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,560
instead of resting himself?

182
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,079
Sir.

183
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,759
That's not true.

184
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:43,600
Lord War wasn't watching me sleep.

185
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,680
He was...

186
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,240
What is it?

187
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,720
It's mature content.

188
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,759
My Lord.

189
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,639
I must expose her lie.

190
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,680
She shouldn't sully your reputation.

191
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,160
Did she lie?

192
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,360
I...

193
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:15,519
Your...

194
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:16,680
Your Highness, don't take me wrong.

195
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,879
It must be

196
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:18,439
that Chen Sanbiao

197
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,199
stole

198
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,040
your handkerchief.

199
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:20,879
Men.

200
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,680
Escort Her Highness back.

201
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:29,560
We received words

202
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,319
to release her only
if Lord War turns up.

203
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,759
If not,

204
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,159
detain Chu Jinghong for a few days.

205
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,000
Hold on.

206
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:41,480
There are many doubts about the case

207
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,080
hasn't been solved.

208
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,919
I shall hold a trial

209
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,240
after

210
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,159
I verify the fact.

211
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:46,919
Wait, sir.

212
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,399
Lock her up.

213
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,039
Lock her up.

214
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:50,679
Let's go.

215
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,600
Dismiss.

216
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,200
I have never been in prison
my entire life.

217
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:05,399
Yes.

218
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,000
Eunuch Ye.

219
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,159
What brings you here?

220
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,080
Tsk-tsk, I will do it.

221
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,559
It's done.

222
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:22,919
Let's go.

223
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,200
Does this cost a lot?

224
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,039
Cost a lot?

225
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:40,679
What do you mean?

226
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,399
Didn't you bribe them
to get me out of here?

227
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,080
How much did you give?

228
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,720
Can I just leave the prison

229
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,240
or bail for a few days?

230
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,480
Bail?

231
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,639
Fresh choice of word.

232
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,120
But

233
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,000
I don't need to bribe

234
00:09:58,519 --> 00:09:59,519
to get someone out of here.

235
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:00,720
I see.

236
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:01,600
True though.

237
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,799
After all, you're the director
of the Internal Activities Depot.

238
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,519
Your rank

239
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,799
is definitely

240
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,679
higher Zhao Changqing.

241
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,600
You're a loyal friend.

242
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,360
Let's go.

243
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,480
I didn't come to get you
out of here though.
