Ah!

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,159
Close your eyes.

26
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,719
You shouldn't see this.

27
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,240
Thank you.

28
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,240
Do you feel better?

29
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:04,879
Your wound

30
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:05,759
needs to be dressed quickly.

31
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,680
Otherwise, it will act up.

32
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:08,560
Sure.

33
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,479
I will remember that.

34
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,240
All right.

35
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,360
Feibai.

36
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,439
Feibai.

37
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,280
Well.

38
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,319
She will be fine.

39
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,919
Who's she?

40
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,000
Be careful.

41
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,919
Don't rip your wound.

42
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,680
Get off.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,719
Don't touch me.

44
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,240
Bao'er.

45
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,080
Don't be so rude.

46
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:25,800
Feibai.

47
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,240
Feibai.

48
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:27,800
Who...

49
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,960
Who's she?

50
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:29,759
Oh.

51
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,400
I'm...

52
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,280
She's a physician.

53
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:33,719
I asked her to cure you.

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,759
She has bad skills. I'm in pain now.

55
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:42,199
(What a mean girl.)

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,719
You should rest first.

57
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,039
I will see her off.

58
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,240
Sure.

59
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:48,759
Miss.

60
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,039
Are you curious

61
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,080
about my relationship with him?

62
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,919
I'm just a physician

63
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,240
who came to provide treatment.

64
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,199
As for the rest,

65
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,199
I have no interest in it.

66
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,960
But I want to let you know.

67
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,120
I'm Feibai's fiancee.

68
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,439
I see.

69
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,120
Feibai.

70
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,680
Are physicians of Shang

71
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,360
all so pretty?

72
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,439
I didn't notice that.

73
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,839
She's just a physician.

74
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,360
Stay still

75
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,079
and wait for me.

76
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,519
Don't leave for too long.

77
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,240
I'm sorry about that.

78
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:33,600
Ming Bao'er...

79
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,040
She's my cousin

80
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,240
and she's young.

81
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,680
Besides, she just experienced an attack.

82
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,639
That's why she was spiky.

83
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:42,639
I see.

84
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:43,800
It's fine.

85
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,720
Never mind.

86
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,079
I have to go now.

87
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,639
Let me send you back.

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,439
No need.

89
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,639
You better stay here and look after your

90
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:53,759
Bao'er.

91
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,759
Fengxing.

92
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:07,879
Fengxing.

93
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,279
Yes, Your Highness.

94
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,040
Why...

95
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,839
Why do you ask for me?

96
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,240
Hasn't His Highness returned yet?

97
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:15,800
Your Highness.

98
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,040
His Highness will only be back

99
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,839
after some days.

100
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:19,639
I see.

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,439
All right.

102
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,600
Ye Feibai's wound

103
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,319
needs to be dealt with
in less than two hours.

104
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,079
Otherwise, you'll receive a punishment.

105
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,199
What?

106
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,279
I've already asked him

107
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,319
to handle his own wound.

108
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:55,480
No way, he can't wait anymore.

109
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,839
Where are you going, Your Highness?

110
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,560
Oh.

111
00:05:58,879 --> 00:05:59,759
I want to reach Ye Feibai now.

112
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,600
Can you give me a ride?

113
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,519
Sure.

114
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,800
Give me a moment.

115
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,519
I will get ready with the carriage.

116
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,839
Feibai, it hurts.

117
