=Episode 22=

18
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:06,480
Your Highness.

19
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:09,079
Are we really leaving?

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,560
We never belong in this place.

21
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:18,799
Time to go.

22
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,040
(Hanlu Abode)

23
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:24,959
We received urgent news

24
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,599
that Eastern Xia launched a massive
foray into Northern Chu.

25
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,480
I didn't expect they could be so fast.

26
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,200
In the space of two days,

27
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,400
the army

28
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,519
has already arrived.

29
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,799
It's not about their speed,

30
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:35,840
they acted secretive.

31
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,319
We never heard anything
about their movement.

32
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,480
Meaning to say,

33
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,040
Eastern Xia

34
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,159
has already been on the move earlier.

35
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,719
The attack from Princess Jinghong
towards Wen Liangyu

36
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,560
is an excuse for their real motive.

37
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,760
Even without the death of Jin'er,

38
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,040
still, Princess Jinghong

39
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,519
wouldn't have been able
to dodge the trick.

40
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,439
It's impossible to defend thieves

41
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,799
who have been prepared for a long time.

42
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,120
What should we do now?

43
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,480
Among the four empires,

44
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,480
Eastern Xia is the most powerful

45
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,519
and Northern Chu is the weakest one.

46
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:02,920
If they were to wage a war,

47
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,280
I'm afraid Northern Chu wouldn't stand
even the slightest chance.

48
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,560
Their defeat is foreseen.

49
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,840
The sole solution

50
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:10,960
for this moment...

51
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,120
I will go and negotiate for peace.

52
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,439
Shang will be caught
in the crossfire

53
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,240
which His Majesty doesn't want to see.

54
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,360
I've promised His Majesty

55
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,960
to entrust me with the negotiation.

56
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:20,360
It's also compensation for Jinghong.

57
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,840
Please take care of Jinghong
on my behalf.

58
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,520
There must be a reason why
the empress tried with might and main

59
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,599
to get me out of the capital.

60
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,280
No worries.

61
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:32,840
Though I had a beef

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,280
with Jinghong,

63
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:35,639
however,

64
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,159
she saved my life once.

65
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,319
I, Ming Bao'er,

66
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,360
am not an ungrateful person.

67
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:42,960
The thing is

68
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,000
she already found out
that I'm Ye Feibai.

69
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:46,759
What?

70
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,080
Ye Feibai?

71
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,520
My Lord, you...

72
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,840
Longyuan

73
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:57,360
promised to negotiate for peace
as an envoy.

74
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:01,879
How brilliant, Your Majesty.

75
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,319
At this rate,

76
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,599
you can launch a heavy blow
towards Northern Chu

77
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,360
as well as undercut Eastern Xia.

78
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,000
Kill three birds with one stone.

79
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,719
If Chu Jinghong dies,

80
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,000
Longyuan will no doubt

81
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,800
be in pieces.

82
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,280
He will then

83
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,960
be flattened.

84
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,319
The gown is truly gorgeous.

85
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:34,479
Ling'er.

86
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,280
Why are you bringing this along?

87
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,439
It's such a shame to throw it away.

88
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,639
I suppose you will use the gown later.

89
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,280
So, I brought it along.

90
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,400
I won't use it anymore.

91
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,560
Burn it.

92
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:47,840
Well.

93
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,199
(I never belong to this place.)

94
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,479
(Now that I'm at the half
of this journey.)

95
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,639
(It's time to stop fooling around.)

96
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,159
(Before leaving here,)

97
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,639
(I will do the last thing for you.)

98
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,600
(Blood Curse)

99
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,639
(is merely a poison.)

100
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,639
(Yuhua Pill that breaks the poison
will be done)

101
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,480
(if I obtain the last herb.)

102
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
Since you miss him so much,

103
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,680
why did you leave him?

104
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,360
Why are you here?

105
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,439
Isn't it better for you

106
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,480
if I leave him?

107
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,360
Back then,

108
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,120
I found him
when he suffered from a heavy injury

109
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,680
and I took him back.

110
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,319
Move.

111
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,480
You're awake.

112
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,639
Thank you.

113
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,560
Bao'er.

114
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,639
I will look after you.

115
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:50,360
He plays between two identities
not for himself.

116
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,120
Instead, he's trying
to protect this empire.

117
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,199
If the empire falls apart,

118
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,319
many people will lose their homes.

119
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,240
I understand him.

120
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,399
Lord War of Shang

121
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,720
attacked by Blood Curse

122
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,079
and he was ousted from
the power over military troops.

123
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,000
After all, he needs another power.

124
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,720
That's why he created

125
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:10,680
Internal Activities Depot.

126
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,920
The emperor of Shang
is fatuous, incompetent

127
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,920
and is infatuated with the emperor.

128
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:16,720
If it weren't for Feibai,

129
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,120
the surrounding empires that coveted
would've toppled the capital.

130
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,120
Previously,

131
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,079
it was me

132
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,319
who forced him to call off the wedding.

133
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,920
I threatened him

134
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,279
that I would expose his identity

135
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:31,399
if he married you.

136
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,600
It was my fault. He's innocent.

137
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,000
Actually,

138
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,839
no matter if he's Lord War of Shang

139
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:38,959
or Ye Feibai,

140
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,439
the identities shouldn't be a hindrance
to your relationship.

141
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:42,879
Likewise,

142
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,000
no matter who he is,

143
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,959
he always loves you.

144
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:49,639
Tomorrow,

145
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,879
he's departing to put down the riot.

146
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,759
You should know

147
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,240
who he risks

148
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,600
his life for.

149
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,319
Also, you should know

150
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,399
what to do.

151
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,279

You sleaze. Don't you hug me.

156

Since you want to repay my kindness,

giving me a hug

158
