It's not your fault.

19
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:02,719
This is a coincidence.

20
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,200
No, it's not.

21
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,359
(I know.)

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,439
(It can't be so coincidental)

23
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:09,599
(to just happen today)

24
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,200
(of all days.)

25
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:14,640
It's fine, My Lord.

26
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:16,159
We will get married

27
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:17,239
six months later.

28
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,439
It's the same.

29
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,680
Jinghong.

30
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:21,560
Will you still marry me

31
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:23,439
six months later?

32
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,200
That sounds odd.

33
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,319
Are you

34
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:27,760
going to turn down the marriage

35
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,400
after taking advantage of me?

36
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,760
Of course, I will marry you

37
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,439
as long as you nod your head.

38
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,280
I believe in you.

39
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,480
I believe

40
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,519
that one day,

41
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,439
you will put on the golden armor

42
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,319
riding on iridescent clouds

43
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,719
to marry me

44
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,680
with the blessings from the people.

45
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,079
(Jinghong,)

46
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:51,480
(will you hate me)

47
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,480
(if you find out)

48
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,599
(the wedding is called off
because of me?)

49
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,199
What have you found?

50
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,080
It's the same as in previous cases.

51
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,000
Superficially,

52
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,879
the victim died from being
completely drained of blood.

53
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,639
Recently, there have been frequent
bizarre murders within this capital.

54
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,960
I'm afraid something is looming over.

55
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,400
Yes.

56
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:47,719
What can I receive

57
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,000
if I uncover the truth?

58
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,719
Anything you wish for,
Princess Jinghong.

59
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,719
Anything?

60
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,879
I will give you anything

61
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,840
I could.

62
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,560
For the rest of our lives,

63
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,520
I will give you anything

64
00:02:58,919 --> 00:02:59,520
I could.

65
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,479
Fengxing.

66
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,240
Can you please

67
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:06,759
inform Lord War to come?

68
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,719
I need to speak to him.

69
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,719
Yes.

70
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,240
(Maybe...)

71
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,639
(Maybe I've overthought.)

72
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,560
Feibai.

73
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:26,680
Why are you here again?

74
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,520
Didn't I tell you

75
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,960
he's my man?

76
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,840
Can you stop pestering him?

77
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:35,199
So, this is how you treat someone
who saved your life?

78
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,280
I didn't ask for your help though.

79
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,719
Jeez.

80
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:41,800
Feibai.

81
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,599
I made you your favorite sweet corn
with pine nuts.

82
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,080
My Lord.

83
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,560
This is your favorite sweet corn
with pine nuts.

84
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,400
Bao'er.

85
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,280
Behave yourself.

86
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,680
I cooked this for you.

87
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,080
How could you say that?

88
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:57,599
Let's go

89
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,039
and eat it inside, all right?

90
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,479
I'm on a mission now.

91
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,199
I don't have time for that.

92
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,240
Let go of me.

93
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,360
No.

94
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,479
My Lord.

95
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:17,800
Jinghong.

96
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:19,279
Why do you ask for me?

97
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,639
Well.

98
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,079
My Lord.

99
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,959
There has been

100
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,319
a serial murder case in the capital,

101
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,279
I'd like to seek your assistance.

102
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:29,480
Me?

103
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,040
Yes.

104
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,480
That serial killer

105
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,519
resembles you.

106
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:36,600
I'm worried

107
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,160
someone is trying to plot against you.

108
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,079
Therefore,

109
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,439
we must take the initiative to act

110
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,680
before them.

111
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes.

112
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:45,439
Jinghong.

113
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,519
I do support you.

114
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:48,959
Right.

115
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:50,519
Well,

116
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:51,839
let's go home.

117
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,000
Ah.

118
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,920
Let's head back now.

119
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,199
Bao'er.

120
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,000
I will send you home now.

121
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,560
Feibai.

122
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,480
Am I that annoying?

123
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,399
What has Chu Jinghong done to you?

124
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,759
Why are you so infatuated with her?

125
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:13,399
Bao'er.

126
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,240
As I said,

127
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,720
I will look after you

128
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,000
and protect you

129
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,120
even without the presence
of Chu Jinghong.

130
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,560
You may head home by yourself

131
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,120
if you're upset with me.

132
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:25,439
I have something to attend to.

133
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:26,639
I'm off.

134
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,959
Feibai.

135
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:31,759
My Lord.

136
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,839
Why don't you

137
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,439
fly me back while carrying me?

138
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,680
My Lord.

139
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,839
I'm talking to you.

140
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,079
Carry me back.

141
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,439
If you don't,

142
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,519
I will walk home myself.

143
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,399
No.

144
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:48,839
I will carry you.

145
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:49,920
Come on.

146
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:56,560
Am I that heavy?

147
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:06,879
Jinghong.

148
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,040
My Lord.

149
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,959
You look weak today.

150
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,240
You flew better last time.

151
00:06:18,457 --> 00:06:19,000
I...

152
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,560
I have something to attend to.

153
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:21,560
I need to go now.

154
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:22,800
Hey.

155
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:24,639
My Lord.

156
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,720
Please don't go.

157
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,680
I feel ill at ease.

158
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,680
Can you

159
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,759
sleep with me tonight?

160
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,480
Jinghong.

161
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,240
I have something to attend to now.

162
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:39,519
Maybe next time.

163
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,360
Hey, don't go.

164
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:42,199
