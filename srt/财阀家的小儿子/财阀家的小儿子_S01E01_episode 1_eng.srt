1
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,579
Bring it in.

2
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:10,990


3
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,399
Please sign here.

4
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,730
     

5
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,518
Okay. As you requested,

6
00:01:36,518 --> 00:01:41,359
we deposited 600 million dollars into your account, Sir.

7
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:46,358
You can now withdraw the entire balance whenever you like.

8
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,399
You became so wealthy at such a young age.

9
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,369
Was it hard work or luck?

10
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,600
    

11
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:57,300
   

12
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,150
   

13
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,920
     

14
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:37,740
    

15
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,780
   

16
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:48,279
     

17
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:52,220
 We'll move onto the question on page 83. 

18
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,189
 Which of the following isn't true 

19
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:57,929
 about marketable securities? 

20
00:03:57,929 --> 00:04:00,660
 Equity security... 

21
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,029
 Equity securities is another term for stocks. 

22
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,319
- Here he comes. 
   - Over here!

23
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:23,148
Manipulation of stock prices, breach of duty, and embezzlement.

24
00:04:23,148 --> 00:04:24,518
Do you admit to all the charges?

25
00:04:24,518 --> 00:04:26,148
A three year sentence suspended for five years.

26
00:04:26,148 --> 00:04:27,888
What is your take on the sentence?

27
00:04:27,888 --> 00:04:30,019
Did you expect the court to grant a suspended sentence in the second trial?

28
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,560
Do you have anything to say?

29
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,959
Is there truly no connection between Soonyang Chemical's stock price manipulations and the succession of management rights?

30
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,560
   

31
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,968
   

32
00:04:36,968 --> 00:04:39,270
I'm impressed, Sir.

33
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,470
Your acting has gotten better.

34
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,469
You look good on camera too.

35
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:46,669
The justice department does its job well, doesn't it?

36
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:49,340
Fairly and justly.

37
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,809
Once again, the outcome was undoubtedly three and five.

38
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:55,280
Sentenced for three years with five years suspended on good behavior.

39
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,320
So long as you slap the label 'chaebol' on your forehead,

40
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,365
a noble chairman can get away with breach of fiduciary duty,

41
00:05:01,365 --> 00:05:03,018
embezzlement,

42
00:05:03,018 --> 00:05:06,459
or even tax evasion. They don't care.

43
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:09,459
A fixed wholesale price of three years and five years.

44
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:12,130
It's as if crime comes with a price tag.

45
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:12,940
Why?

46
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,960
Because there can't be a suspended sentence for a sentence over three years.

47
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:20,610
Prosecutor Seo.

48
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:23,710
How will you proceed?

49
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:27,009
What can we do but adhere to the court's ruling?

50
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:28,648
What? Really?

51
00:05:28,648 --> 00:05:34,150
We should respect the ruling and make an appeal with additional evidence.

52
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,689
We'll have him convicted and have him do his time in prison.

53
00:05:37,689 --> 00:05:39,729
Yes, of course.

54
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:42,099
South Korea is a constitutional state.

55
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:45,070
Not the Republic of Soonyang.

56
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,470
   

57
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:51,638
   

58
00:05:51,638 --> 00:05:54,239
Just a second. Excuse me.

59
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,479
Hello, I'm Assistant Manager Shin Gyeong Min.

60
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,989
Hello, Sir. I'm Assistant Manager Shin Gyeong Min.

61
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:15,459
Hello, I just transferred to the Future Asset Management Department

62
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:17,299
I'm Assistant Manager Shin Gyeong Min.

63
00:06:17,299 --> 00:06:19,929
- Is that so? - Yes, Sir.

64
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,840
   

65
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,119
Please collect up all the products that have been set on the tables.

66
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:43,289
They will be replaced.

67
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:46,390
Is there an issue? They aren't past the expiration date.

68
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,859
Actually, who are you?

69
00:06:47,859 --> 00:06:49,528
The chairman is allergic to peaches.

70
00:06:49,528 --> 00:06:52,029
He might lose consciousness from respiratory distress, just from this bottle alone.

71
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:54,969
   

72
00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:56,239
   

73
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:58,640
- Assistant Manager Shin. 
    - Yes?

74
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,668
I'm Senior Manager Yoon Hyeon Woo of the Future Asset Management Department.

75
00:07:01,668 --> 00:07:03,109
Yoon Hyeon Woo?

76
00:07:03,109 --> 00:07:06,409
The one I've heard stories about?

77
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:07,749
I apologize for the belated greeting.

78
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:11,280
I'm Shin Gyeong Min, the newest member of your team.

79
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,749
We don't have time for that. Let's hurry.

80
00:07:12,749 --> 00:07:14,320
Yes, Sir.

81
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,920
- Remove those beverages. 
     - Sure.

82
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:21,729
What should I do to become like you?

83
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:25,669
I hear the brutal workload here has the average person quit in less than three years.

84
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:27,599
You're the only one who has held out for more than five years,

85
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,610
and you even serve the chairman as one of his most trusted employees.

86
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,579
Allow me, Sir.

87
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,650
I want to be just like you, Mr. Yoon.

88
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:44,180
Could you share some pointers? I'm a quick study, you see.

89
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,219
Let me see your phone.

90
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:49,190
Gosh, are we exchanging numbers?

91
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,530
It isn't one of Soonyang's.

92
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:58,170
I'll get a new one right away!

93
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,400
Could he be any sexier?

94
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:08,040
   

95
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,878
- Can you look this way? 
    - Over here!

96
00:08:09,878 --> 00:08:12,279
- Please look this way. 
    - Can you look this way?

97
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:14,079
- Over here. 
    - Sir, please.

98
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,649
- Could you look this way? 
     - Sir, over here.

99
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:19,890
- Over here, please. 
    - Please look this way.

100
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,296
- This way, please. 
    - How have you been doing?

101
00:08:22,296 --> 00:08:25,190
 Attention. 1-0, 1-alpha are entering the building. 

102
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,159
Let us hurry.

103
00:08:27,829 --> 00:08:30,329
Mr. Yoon, what does "1-0" mean?

104
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:33,629
We are not allowed to refer to the chairman's family by name.

105
00:08:33,629 --> 00:08:37,268
The chairman, who is the eldest, goes by 1-0, and his wife is 1-alpha.

106
00:08:37,268 --> 00:08:40,668
The vice-chairman goes by 2-0, his wife is 2-alpha, and his daughter is 2-1.

107
00:08:40,668 --> 00:08:43,279
And so on and so forth.

108
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:58,459
I have 1-1 and 1-2 coming up from the parking lot.

109
00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:01,259
What is it? What is this about?

110
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:03,700
Can't you give me a heads up?

111
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,128
The ceremony will commence soon.

112
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:09,440
I don't know what this is about, but tell him after the ceremony.

113
00:09:10,369 --> 00:09:15,409
Don't you know who Father is having this ceremony for?

114
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:16,878
The press, prominent social figures,

115
00:09:16,878 --> 00:09:18,449
and members of your exceptional family

116
00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:20,879
will be focused on you today.

117
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:23,280
Are you going to ruin it for yourself?

118
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,059
Sir.

119
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:34,190
Father!

120
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:48,610
The succession within Soonyang Group.

121
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,550
It won't go as planned.

122
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:58,279
Because I'm renouncing my inheritance.

123
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:00,390
What?

124
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:05,289
Shortly at 11 a.m., we will commence the bust unveiling ceremony

125
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:08,558
of Soonyang Group's founder, the late Chairman Jin Yang Cheol.

126
00:10:08,558 --> 00:10:09,398
   

127
00:10:09,398 --> 00:10:12,969
We ask all guests present at the event

128
00:10:12,969 --> 00:10:16,839
to take their seats to ensure a smooth ceremony.

129
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,209
We will soon commence the bust unveiling ceremony.

130
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:24,140
   

131
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:33,249
The accident that day.

132
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:36,719
Did you think I would never find out?

133
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,930
- Seong Jun. 
    - It's over, Father.

134
00:10:41,499 --> 00:10:44,259
Pride... 
    

135
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:48,300
is only feared when someone is worthy enough.

136
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,799
How dare you renounce your inheritance!

137
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:57,180
Especially when you haven't earned even a penny on your own before.

138
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,150
The house you live in,

139
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:04,550
your car, your title, your wife,

140
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:08,150
and even your name.

141
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,859
What you have been enjoying

142
00:11:10,859 --> 00:11:16,400
were given to you by me, your grandfather, and Soonyang.

143
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,729
Pride...

144
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,199
is a luxury enjoyed only by those who can actually leave all of that behind.

145
00:11:27,609 --> 00:11:30,810
You are not a man of such caliber.

146
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,309
No one knows that more than I do.

147
00:11:36,349 --> 00:11:42,919
All I did was do my best for you, as your father.

148
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,130
It was for my sake, you say?

149
00:11:51,099 --> 00:11:53,000
You

150
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,270
have been suffocating me in the cruelest way.

151
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:01,809
The fact that I am not worthy.

152
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:05,779
That I'm not a man who can lead Soonyang.

153
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:10,879
You told me that in your own way.

154
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:14,020
With your choice that day.

155
00:12:18,859 --> 00:12:21,490
This is me living up to expectations.

156
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,460
Don't go.

157
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,370
Don't...

158
00:12:37,849 --> 00:12:40,409
 Chairman Jin, it's time. 

159
00:12:41,349 --> 00:12:43,320
 Chairman Jin? 

160
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,689
Chairman Jin, it's Yoon Hyeon Woo.

161
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:52,729
Sir!

162
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:55,599
Sir?

163
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:02,728
Send paramedics to the chairman's office. This is an emergency.

164
00:13:02,728 --> 00:13:05,370
Sir?

165
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,109
Sir!

166
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,520
Come on. Hurry!

167
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,160
You said Young Ki would be behind bars.

168
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,200
Well, you never do keep your promises.

169
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,939
Darn politicians.

170
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,868
Politics should be conducted from a broad perspective.

171
00:13:37,868 --> 00:13:41,169
The whole nation shouldn't have to suffer from a family feud.

172
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:43,079
"Soonyang runs the South Korean economy."

173
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:44,650
Your family takes pride in that.

174
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,879
I'm close to witnessing Seong Jun's coronation

175
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,680
at the ceremony designed to commemorate my father

176
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,690
all while clapping my hands off.

177
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:57,220
That's why you should've supported me back then instead of your own family.

178
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,588
If you had done that, you would have claimed the throne.

179
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,560
- No way. 
     - Yes way.

180
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,999
- No way. 
     - Yes way.

181
00:14:02,999 --> 00:14:05,170
- How mature of you. 
     - I'm glad you noticed.

182
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,170
- Do you have dementia? 
     - You know nothing about...

183
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:10,040
Goodness, Director Kim.

184
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,870
So? What is this about?

185
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,069
Allow me to tell you inside.

186
00:14:24,749 --> 00:14:26,949
What is this?

187
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,520
Why did you gather us in private?

188
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,629
The chairman is currently receiving emergency surgery

189
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:38,170
for acute myocardial infarction.

190
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,900
What?

191
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:48,779
What about the unveiling ceremony?

192
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:51,009
We will proceed as planned.

193
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:55,349
Issuing a press release will hurt our stock price.

194
00:14:55,349 --> 00:14:57,990
The special announcement

195
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:01,959
should come from the chairman for it to be meaningful.

196
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:04,989
- Of course. 
      - The chairman of a company who the prosecution just released...

197
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:07,760
was now met with a health issue.

198
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,030
Displaying a lack of leadership won't help the business.

199
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,500
So?

200
00:15:14,369 --> 00:15:16,400
Who should announce it instead?

201
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,540
Honey, did you bring another necktie?

202
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,709
It's in the car. Should I get it?

203
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:22,780
Yes.

204
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,779
Vice-Chairman Jin Seong Jun should give the announcement.

205
00:15:27,579 --> 00:15:28,820
What?

206
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,219
The announcement.

207
00:15:30,219 --> 00:15:33,249
The restructuring of the organizational hierarchy may seem complex,

208
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:35,220
but the issue at hand is simple.

209
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,119
How will Soonyang resolve its issue surrounding the succession?

210
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:42,459
Don't they all want to see the vice-chairman step up to the plate?

211
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:46,729
The government, the shareholders, and the people.

212
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,839
Don't you agree, Hyeon Min?

213
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:13,229
I hear you summoned me.

214
00:16:13,229 --> 00:16:18,060
You never have to ask Mr. Yoon twice.

215
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,309
After the unveiling ceremony,

216
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:27,839
Soonyang will make a special public announcement.

217
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,079
Vice-Chairman Jin Seong Jun will be giving the speech.

218
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,620
The ceremony will be over in thirty minutes.

219
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,889
You are to find him wherever he went and bring him to me.

220
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:42,189
Time isn't a luxury we have, Mr. Yoon.

221
00:16:42,189 --> 00:16:44,520
You must hurry.

222
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,970
If he isn't on the podium by that time,

223
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,740
you will no longer have a place at Soonyang.

224
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:04,640
The shortest route to the hotel will get you back in 20 minutes.

225
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,309
- I'll drive. 
    - Sure.

226
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,188
The only problem is that the nearby department store is having a sales event, and it's lunch hour.

227
00:17:13,188 --> 00:17:15,319
If we get stalled at the hotel,

228
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:18,620
thirty minutes won't be enough.

229
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,730
You should formally complain about the unreasonable task.

230
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:24,060
You said you wanted to be like me.

231
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,100
Of course.

232
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,429
- Do you wish for a long career? 
     - Yes.

233
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:29,539
There are three things I never do.

234
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:31,709
Three things. Just a second.

235
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:34,270
I never reject orders made by the chairman's family.

236
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:37,309
I never ask questions, and...

237
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:45,990
I never make my own judgment.

238
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,890
Those are my rules.

239
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,229
Excuse me. Vice-Chairman Jin?

240
00:18:38,769 --> 00:18:40,869
Vice-Chairman Jin?

241
00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:46,980
Quiet.

242
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:51,319
I can hear them speak.

243
00:18:52,219 --> 00:18:57,259
They can sense tremors on the sides of their bodies.

244
00:18:57,259 --> 00:19:00,759
Right now, they're speaking loudly.

245
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,959
They want us to be quiet.

246
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:08,969
French cuisine made from seasonal ingredients will be served...

247
00:19:08,969 --> 00:19:12,239
When in danger,

248
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:15,680
they send out a distress signal.

249
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:17,910
Do you know what it is?

250
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:22,009
If you're not interested, we will not serve lunch today.

251
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,090
Sir?

252
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,790
Vice-Chairman Jin?

253
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:35,730
Didn't I tell you to be quiet?

254
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,929
I just said it.

255
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,469
Please!

256
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,980
I ruined it.

257
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,979
It's ruined!

258
00:19:57,979 --> 00:20:01,189
You knew the answer!

259
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,589
You will pee.

260
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,369
Just like now.

261
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:21,540
One, two, three!

262
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:38,689
Who called you wise when you are the opposite?

263
00:20:38,689 --> 00:20:42,030
Why would you let Seong Jun make the announcement?

264
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,869
You'd only be solidifying his position at the company.

265
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,800
Don't you know that?

266
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,639
That'll only be the case if he makes the announcement.

267
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:54,839
Are you saying he won't be here?

268
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:56,979
It'll be official.

269
00:20:56,979 --> 00:20:59,779
Vice-Chairman Jin Seong Jun

270
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:03,819
is a bit too dangerous to take on the mantle.

271
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,800
Darn it!

272
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,000
If you had been quiet,

273
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,869
none of this would've happened.

274
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:31,709
Once again, you think I'm the bad guy.

275
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:35,019
Why make me out to be one,

276
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:38,280
when you're the ones at fault?

277
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,419
Why?

278
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:44,259
Mr. Jin...

279
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:47,030
Mr. Yoon, are you all right?

280
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:53,100
Mr. Shin, escort everyone out.

281
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,299
Sure. Let us leave. Come on.

282
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:57,600
Oh, no.

283
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,869
This happened in 1987,

284
00:22:32,569 --> 00:22:36,980
at the sixtieth birthday party of your grandfather, former Chairman Jin.

285
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,049
You smashed the Goryeo celadon that he cherished

286
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:44,019
and were scolded by him for the first time.

287
00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:47,389
- What? 
     - Not because of the celadon...

288
00:22:49,589 --> 00:22:52,859
but because being driven by emotions

289
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:56,259
wasn't a fitting quality for someone

290
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:59,898
who was to run the business that is Soonyang.

291
00:22:59,898 --> 00:23:02,669
- Mr. Yoon! 
 - I read it

292
00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:05,409
in his autobiography.

293
00:23:05,409 --> 00:23:07,940
Since that day, you honed his teachings

294
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,379
and gave thought to the true qualities of a businessman.

295
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,210
That is how

296
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:16,019
you were able

297
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:19,449
to become the responsible and prudent businessman you are known to be.

298
00:23:19,449 --> 00:23:22,660
The PR team is putting together a press release.

299
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,560
You were only late to the unveiling ceremony

300
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,059
because you stayed behind until the last second

301
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:32,300
in order to cautiously reflect the late chairman's

302
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:37,400
management philosophy in the announcement.

303
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:42,170
The ceremony ends in twelve minutes.

304
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,080
If you make it there by that time,

305
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,609
no one will take issue with today's events.

306
00:24:00,489 --> 00:24:02,730
Wait for me outside.

307
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:31,790
The chairman is currently receiving emergency surgery.

308
00:24:32,459 --> 00:24:37,699
What happened in that room before he collapsed...

309
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:42,069
will never become public knowledge.

310
00:24:48,209 --> 00:24:50,580
For I

311
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,550
will never talk.

312
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,049
You have ten minutes.

313
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:02,919
I only ask for your cooperation.

314
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:35,919
Promoting nonsense such as

315
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,030
open-minded management

316
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:42,859
has mutts barking at their owners, Mr. Yoon.

317
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,440
Have the car ready.

318
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,950
Thank you, Mr. Jin. Thank you.

319
00:26:31,509 --> 00:26:34,879
Gosh. I apologize for my tardiness.

320
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,019
Our Soonyang Group

321
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:44,460
wishes to do fulfill our responsibility as one of Korea's top companies

322
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,360
by being reliable and by meeting the ethical standards of the people.

323
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,968
Soonyang will be restructured as a holding company

324
00:26:51,968 --> 00:26:53,869
to improve asset quality,

325
00:26:53,869 --> 00:26:58,970
which is an issue the group has been called out on multiple times.

326
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,540
   

327
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,639
   

328
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:05,579
I am well aware

329
00:27:05,579 --> 00:27:10,920
that Soonyang has been criticized for evading the law

330
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:15,790
during its tumultuous former succession processes.

331
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:20,959
We will accept any criticism that comes our way

332
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:27,329
and do our best to honestly answer the demands of the times.

333
00:27:28,169 --> 00:27:34,400
Soonyang's innovation won't remain limited to its technology and products.

334
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,540
In that sense, the huge amount of tax on profit that will be levied

335
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,249
as a result of the shares traded

336
00:27:39,249 --> 00:27:41,308
by all subsidiary companies during the transition

337
00:27:41,308 --> 00:27:45,049
will be paid faithfully and accurately.

338
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,160
That little brat.

339
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,459
What on earth is that brat blabbering about?

340
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,500
A business that'll benefit the nation.

341
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,969
Fairness in business.

342
00:28:00,969 --> 00:28:05,499
I will honor the wishes of my grandfather, former Chairman Jin Yang Cheol,

343
00:28:05,499 --> 00:28:10,870
and let Soonyang be reborn as a company that is cherished by the people.

344
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:21,690
   

345
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:54,420
   

346
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,750
Gyeong Min, you probably know.

347
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,419
Tell us.

348
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:30,390
What happened to Mr. Yoon's face?

349
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:32,590
As if you need to ask.

350
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:35,529
Everyone knows that 1-1 can be violent.

351
00:29:35,529 --> 00:29:38,799
Even after the humiliation,

352
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,568
I bet he'll act all high and mighty as the senior manager at Soonyang.

353
00:29:42,568 --> 00:29:44,770
Mr. Yoon.

354
00:29:45,709 --> 00:29:47,209
He's incredible.

355
00:29:47,209 --> 00:29:50,610
Not just anyone can be the chairman's right-hand man.

356
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:52,380
He's no right-hand man.

357
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,909
A dirty glove he wears on his right hand, maybe.

358
00:29:54,909 --> 00:29:57,419
You know, the cheap kind you wear

359
00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:00,120
to keep your hands clean that can be replaced at any time.

360
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,920
To be honest, he doesn't have the qualifications.

361
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,890
He was a handpicked high-school graduate.

362
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:07,435
They're easily done away with.

363
00:30:07,435 --> 00:30:10,728
What qualified guy, in their right mind, would do what he does?

364
00:30:10,728 --> 00:30:14,730
But look at Mr. Yoon. He stakes his life to serve.

365
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,070
He has to.

366
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,769
He's not good at much else.

367
00:30:25,309 --> 00:30:28,579
   

368
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:31,219
Hello, Ma'am, Yoon speaking.

369
00:30:31,219 --> 00:30:33,450
Sorry for taking my time.

370
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:38,159
Yes, I understand. I'll be right over. Bye.

371
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,760
It's done, Ma'am.

372
00:31:55,169 --> 00:32:00,399
You know, I feel uncomfortable, Mr. Yoon.

373
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:05,839
I know he has a carer, but I'm stuck here as long as my husband is.

374
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:09,350
You know how particular I am about cleanliness.

375
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:16,249
Must I call and give instructions regarding minute details?

376
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,790
I apologize.

377
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,290
I was neglectful.

378
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:26,530
I'm not a stingy person, am I?

379
00:32:38,239 --> 00:32:42,949
I know my manners.

380
00:32:42,949 --> 00:32:44,219
Here.

381
00:32:44,219 --> 00:32:47,449
Not at all. It's fine.

382
00:32:47,449 --> 00:32:48,990
Go on.

383
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,960
Take it.

384
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,559
Yes?

385
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:56,359
Yes. Thank you.

386
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,779
   

387
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:19,349
Hi, I'm late.

388
00:33:19,349 --> 00:33:21,350
I'm leaving now.

389
00:33:40,439 --> 00:33:44,939
Hyeon Woo, have some braised ribs.

390
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,150
Your mom got spoiled today.

391
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,950
She got served by her eldest son.

392
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:57,618
You didn't make it last year, and Mom waited for a while.

393
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:01,688
I tried to burn the prayer after the rite, but it just wouldn't burn.

394
00:34:01,688 --> 00:34:04,930
This is how it has always been.

395
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:07,099
Mom will understand.

396
00:34:07,099 --> 00:34:10,540
Oh, I forgot to bring the soup.

397
00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:21,710
Hyeon Woo.

398
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,219
Yes?

399
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,350
This is for you.

400
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:29,959
What is it?

401
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,290
   

402
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:37,160
I got my first paycheck.

403
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,529
Are you working?

404
00:34:42,569 --> 00:34:45,069
What about the civil service exam?

405
00:34:45,069 --> 00:34:46,970
I quit studying for that.

406
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:50,869
If I couldn't pass for so long, it's not meant to be.

407
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:55,009
I can't ask you to pay my expenses and classes forever.

408
00:34:56,379 --> 00:35:00,390
Are you afraid I can't support you?

409
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,719
- It's not that. 
 - Hyeon Min.

410
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:05,489
Do you think so little of me too?

411
00:35:05,489 --> 00:35:10,000
You've done more than enough for Dad and me.

412
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Now I want to help out.

413
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,569
You've been shouldering the burden for a long time.

414
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:21,109
Your brother has a point.

415
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:25,439
You should live for yourself now.

416
00:35:25,439 --> 00:35:29,355
You may work at the greatest company in the country,

417
00:35:29,355 --> 00:35:32,749
at a successful job working for the highest people there.

418
00:35:32,749 --> 00:35:36,719
But you must have a family of your own

419
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:40,989
to be able to call yourself a real man and a grown-up.

420
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:51,269
I should have a wife and kids, a family of my own?

421
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:57,340
Is that what made you a dignified man?

422
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,239
Father.

423
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:02,480
Do you have the right to say that to me?

424
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,280
Father.

425
00:36:05,489 --> 00:36:08,419
It's Mom's death anniversary.

426
00:36:08,419 --> 00:36:10,818
It's the anniversary of her death of all days.

427
00:36:10,818 --> 00:36:14,060
- And you're saying... 
 - Hyeon Woo.

428
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,929
Stop it.

429
00:36:19,569 --> 00:36:21,400
Whatever.

430
00:36:23,069 --> 00:36:25,140
Are you leaving already?

431
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,209
Bye.

432
00:36:26,209 --> 00:36:28,940
Hyeon Woo, why not stay the night?

433
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:40,720
Hyung.

434
00:37:07,179 --> 00:37:08,479
   

435
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:11,079
Move it, okay? You're too slow.

436
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:14,349
Let's be quick.

437
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,159
   

438
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,960
   

439
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,700
   

440
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,200
   

441
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:39,210
   

442
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:42,620
Take all the files, even if they're double-sided.

443
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:45,649
- Empty all the drawers. 
 - Okay.

444
00:37:45,649 --> 00:37:48,320
Hurry up. Be quick.

445
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,718
Take the hard drives, files, everything.

446
00:37:51,718 --> 00:37:54,030
Don't leave anything behind.

447
00:37:56,959 --> 00:37:58,700
   

448
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,469
Who's in charge here?

449
00:38:00,469 --> 00:38:02,730
Let's see the warrant.

450
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:23,290
Senior Manager Yoon Hyeon Woo, Future Asset Management Department.

451
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:27,529
Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong with the Anti-corruption Team.

452
00:38:28,259 --> 00:38:31,860
Let's see the search and seizure warrant.

453
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,330
I'll take it.

454
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,008
We suspect Soonyang Chemicals and Soonyang World's window dressing

455
00:38:47,008 --> 00:38:51,950
was set up by Soonyang Corporation's Planning and Coordination.

456
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:56,919
The goal would be Vice-Chairman Jin Seong Jun's illegal takeover.

457
00:38:56,919 --> 00:39:01,189
Soonyang does not bend or break any laws in the succession process.

458
00:39:01,189 --> 00:39:03,159
As per the special statement that was read out yesterday.

459
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:05,099
I interpreted that differently.

460
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:07,769
"To be able to afford the massive amount of taxes"

461
00:39:07,769 --> 00:39:10,140
"that would occur in the process,"

462
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,269
"the owner family including Jin Young Ki"

463
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:16,169
"and Jin Seong Jun have enough funds stashed aside."

464
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,980
It sounded like a confession to me.

465
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:22,350
And I couldn't ignore that confession.

466
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:26,089
- If we're done, let's go. 
 - Okay.

467
00:39:26,089 --> 00:39:29,019
Pack up. It's time to go.

468
00:39:35,899 --> 00:39:38,260
The Future Asset Management Department?

469
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:42,729
That means the owner's family is the future asset.

470
00:39:43,899 --> 00:39:46,540
Do you really think so?

471
00:39:50,439 --> 00:39:53,749
They call you "Soonyang's Grim Reaper."

472
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:03,420
Not only do you only wear black,

473
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:08,188
you indict anyone without a care if Soonyang's involved somehow.

474
00:40:09,229 --> 00:40:13,869
Do you want to gain fame for taking Soonyang down or...

475
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:18,069
is there a personal vendetta others don't know about?

476
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:22,470
There's a lot of gossip about you.

477
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,310
I don't think it's either.

478
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:28,409
I think

479
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:32,120
you're just doing your job as best you can.

480
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:35,850
The same goes for me as well.

481
00:40:38,919 --> 00:40:41,629
Do you take special lessons?

482
00:40:41,629 --> 00:40:43,830
You're quite eloquent.

483
00:40:55,339 --> 00:40:57,310
   

484
00:40:58,609 --> 00:41:00,610
   

485
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:03,950
Is it true?

486
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:10,419
All the computers are new, never used once,

487
00:41:10,419 --> 00:41:12,659
and other than the first few pages,

488
00:41:12,659 --> 00:41:17,030
the files are printouts of PR stuff and of Soonyang's history.

489
00:41:17,759 --> 00:41:19,769
It has to be that

490
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:24,269
they knew we'd be coming, and they were prepared.

491
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:20,629
- Mr. Shin. 
 - Yes?

492
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,259
Planning and Coordination's seating chart.

493
00:42:24,259 --> 00:42:26,628
Replace all the computers as assigned.

494
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:28,999
Yes, Sir.

495
00:42:29,669 --> 00:42:33,710
I sent a list of files to either keep or delete.

496
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:36,739
It's a sensitive job, so be extra careful.

497
00:42:36,739 --> 00:42:38,880
Yes, Sir.

498
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:44,119
Mr. Shin.

499
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,750
Did you get a new phone?

500
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,889
Oh, yes.

501
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:54,630
Mr. Yoon.

502
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,729
So...

503
00:42:59,729 --> 00:43:04,699
I apologize. What happened yesterday...

504
00:43:04,699 --> 00:43:08,170
I'm off to report to the vice-chairman.

505
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,379
Do you want to tag along?

506
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,909
Yes.

507
00:43:21,049 --> 00:43:24,819
Prosecutors are so weird.

508
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:28,689
I said I'd abide by the law, and they attacked me first.

509
00:43:29,759 --> 00:43:32,200
It makes me want to retaliate.

510
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:36,799
What's the likelihood of another search and seizure?

511
00:43:36,799 --> 00:43:39,909
It is very unlikely.

512
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:42,769
I already gave Mr. Yoon the necessary instructions.

513
00:43:42,769 --> 00:43:46,778
He'll work with Planning and Coordination, and any problematic files

514
00:43:46,778 --> 00:43:49,679
will be carefully separated and deleted forever.

515
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:51,880
Even if prosecutors come by again,

516
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:56,689
they won't find anything illegal or suspicious, Sir.

517
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:30,789
You do a good job.

518
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:34,629
Thank you.

519
00:44:48,669 --> 00:44:52,480
   

520
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:01,150
Who was that gentleman?

521
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:04,520
He's 4-0, Advisor Jin Yoon Ki.

522
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:08,160
Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's fourth son.

523
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,600
I didn't know the late chairman had a fourth son.

524
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:16,100
I heard he'd cut ties with the family for some reason.

525
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:21,710
- Mr. Shin? 
 - Yes?

526
00:45:22,709 --> 00:45:24,439
Oh, right.

527
00:46:01,979 --> 00:46:05,519
Wasn't that ex-Miss Soonyang and movie star...

528
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:07,450
What was her name?

529
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:09,489
She's 4-alpha.

530
00:46:09,489 --> 00:46:11,489
What? Then she's...

531
00:46:11,489 --> 00:46:14,960
Yes. She's married to Advisor Jin Yoon Ki.

532
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,330
She's the exact reason he cut ties with the family.

533
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:20,029
That's crazy.

534
00:46:20,029 --> 00:46:23,200
Do they have any children?

535
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,299
They have a son.

536
00:46:24,299 --> 00:46:29,369
I heard 4-1 is into entertainment that's not tied to Soonyang.

537
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:31,139
He must be quite old.

538
00:46:31,139 --> 00:46:34,410
I guess it pays to come from a great family.

539
00:46:36,549 --> 00:46:39,480
His heart stopped twice during surgery,

540
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,549
so while administering CPR,

541
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:44,990
we inserted a stent in his aorta.

542
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:49,159
As a result, this morning, oxygen saturation was good,

543
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:53,160
and all numbers and levels have returned to normal.

544
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,700
Oh, thank you. Thanks so much.

545
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,870
- Thank you. 
 - I must see him.

546
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:03,639
Right now, complete rest is the best medicine.

547
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:06,180
You cannot see him for a while.

548
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:09,109
Please cooperate.

549
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:12,350
Doctor Ahn.

550
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:14,589
Just a moment.

551
00:47:20,889 --> 00:47:23,900
You still have that skill.

552
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,569
You startle people by showing up.

553
00:47:26,569 --> 00:47:29,330
And you're still afraid.

554
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:33,439
If you have nothing, you fear nothing.

555
00:47:34,069 --> 00:47:37,410
You should try harder, Auntie.

556
00:47:38,339 --> 00:47:39,840
Did you call her?

557
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,150
As if anyone misses her.

558
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:45,280
She doesn't even take my calls.

559
00:47:52,859 --> 00:47:55,560
A long time has passed.

560
00:47:57,129 --> 00:48:00,798
Am I still an unwelcome guest within the family?

561
00:48:00,798 --> 00:48:05,140
- You know that and... 
 - If you knew what I brought,

562
00:48:06,769 --> 00:48:09,840
you couldn't mistreat me anymore.

563
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,640
Let's hear it.

564
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,008
What did you bring with you?

565
00:48:14,008 --> 00:48:16,180
Three percent.

566
00:48:16,819 --> 00:48:21,089
Three percent of Soonyang Corporation's shares.

567
00:48:25,019 --> 00:48:28,629
Once Soonyang becomes a holding company,

568
00:48:28,629 --> 00:48:33,430
when the time comes for you to fight over who becomes chairman,

569
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,269
won't my three percent be the casting vote?

570
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:44,440
What do you want instead?

571
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:52,720
My son.

572
00:49:02,329 --> 00:49:04,599
I must know...

573
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:07,800
the truth behind the accident that day.

574
00:49:10,169 --> 00:49:13,100
You all know!

575
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:18,740
Bring me the answer.

576
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:24,050
Then I'll hand over all I own.

577
00:49:31,919 --> 00:49:33,660
Thank you.

578
00:49:38,259 --> 00:49:40,500
Mr. Yoon, I need to talk to you about something.

579
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,400
Sure.

580
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,838
As you said, I separated the files to be discarded from the ones we should keep.

581
00:49:44,838 --> 00:49:47,970
- The ones on the computer too? 
 - Yes.

582
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:51,510
But I found something.

583
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:54,150
Well...

584
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:57,550
This wasn't on the list.

585
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:01,949
The thing is, it's an old document that is out of date.

586
00:50:01,949 --> 00:50:05,089
At first, I was just going to dispose of it. But I saw

587
00:50:05,089 --> 00:50:09,560
a number of transactions involving large amounts over a long period of time.

588
00:50:10,629 --> 00:50:13,899
You should go through it and decide what to do with it.

589
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:32,690
   

590
00:50:45,029 --> 00:50:46,200
   

591
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:57,890
   

592
00:51:06,819 --> 00:51:10,019
As you can see, Soonyang Micro

593
00:51:10,019 --> 00:51:13,890
is a dummy company that only exists on paper.

594
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:16,199
The records show large transactions between the company

595
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:19,500
and Soonyang's subsidiaries that took place for over a decade.

596
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:23,369
However, despite Soonyang Micro's transaction and sales records,

597
00:51:23,369 --> 00:51:28,139
I could not find anything on the company...

598
00:51:28,139 --> 00:51:31,409
in any of Soonyang's contracts and financial documents,

599
00:51:31,409 --> 00:51:35,510
as if it had been hidden on purpose.

600
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:41,050
Do you

601
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:44,189
realize what that means?

602
00:51:44,189 --> 00:51:48,160
Someone is siphoning Soonyang's money overseas

603
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:52,600
through this paper company, Sir.

604
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:08,649
- Sir. 
 - This is

605
00:52:08,649 --> 00:52:12,220
just a document that should've been disposed of long ago.

606
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:17,219
Had there been a problem, Internal Affairs would've already dealt with it.

607
00:52:20,189 --> 00:52:25,859
Do you think you're more competent than Soonyang's top-tier talents?

608
00:52:25,859 --> 00:52:26,900
But this is clearly–

609
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:30,969
Mr. Yoon Hyeon Woo, the head of Future Asset Management.

610
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:41,609
Do you know why I've been keeping you on for the past five years?

611
00:52:42,279 --> 00:52:47,620
You know exactly when to step in and when to back off. That's why.

612
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:50,290
So keep it up.

613
00:52:50,290 --> 00:52:53,220
Do not make me repeat myself.

614
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,660
Got anything else to say?

615
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:59,530
No, Sir.

616
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:17,979
I guess you had to work late, Mr. Yoon.

617
00:53:27,189 --> 00:53:31,300
So? Have you finished organizing the documents?

618
00:53:35,299 --> 00:53:37,170
Yes, sir.

619
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:39,339
It's been taken care of.

620
00:53:39,969 --> 00:53:41,340
I'll be off, then.

621
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:44,480
   

622
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,280
It was white porcelain.

623
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,979
My grandfather's vase that I broke.

624
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:55,550
It wasn't Goryeo celadon. It was a white porcelain vase.

625
00:53:55,550 --> 00:54:00,359
But in his autobiography, he wrote that it was a Goryeo celadon vase.

626
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:05,430
I swear, he knew nothing about me.

627
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:08,430
You know more about me than he ever did.

628
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:16,440
My grandfather always said

629
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:20,579
that Soonyang would go broke because of lazy fools like me.

630
00:54:20,579 --> 00:54:23,549
But once again, he was wrong.

631
00:54:23,549 --> 00:54:27,079
Sure, there are lazy fools like me at Soonyang...

632
00:54:29,819 --> 00:54:33,189
but the company has employees like you as well.

633
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,709
You certainly deserve to wear the Soonyang badge.

634
00:54:51,239 --> 00:54:56,310
About that day, thank you, Mr. Yoon.

635
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,160
Don't look at me like that. You should get going.

636
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,429
Yes, Sir.

637
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,980
   

638
00:55:37,289 --> 00:55:40,319
   

639
00:55:41,029 --> 00:55:43,289
Sir.

640
00:55:43,289 --> 00:55:45,600
There's something I must tell you.

641
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:48,999
   

642
00:55:52,169 --> 00:55:54,570
Soonyang's assets are being siphoned

643
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:57,740
into a paper company overseas in large amounts.

644
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:00,779
And the prosecution

645
00:56:00,779 --> 00:56:05,519
suspects that Soonyang has a large slush fund.

646
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:08,920
Once the prosecution finds out about the paper company,

647
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:12,488
the company will be charged with embezzlement, breach of duty, and tax evasion.

648
00:56:12,488 --> 00:56:14,360
Also,

649
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:17,760
the plans for the holding company and the succession will be affected.

650
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,769
Then let me hear what you think I should do.

651
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,840
You should make a move before the prosecution does.

652
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,438
Submit a declaration of business closure for the paper company

653
00:56:29,438 --> 00:56:33,480
and make sure Soonyang Corporation absorbs the assets.

654
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,710
That's my suggestion, Sir.

655
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:41,120
Did you find this in a cabinet in Planning and Coordination?

656
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,150
That's correct, Sir.

657
00:56:43,819 --> 00:56:46,789
Where is the original document?

658
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:50,830
Not these photos you took.

659
00:56:50,830 --> 00:56:53,000
The original document.

660
00:56:57,269 --> 00:56:58,739
Pardon me?

661
00:57:01,569 --> 00:57:03,910
The original document...

662
00:57:05,009 --> 00:57:07,879
Sir, Mr. Kim is here.

663
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:09,400
Okay.

664
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:17,790
   

665
00:57:21,259 --> 00:57:25,399
Mr. Yoon brought something interesting.

666
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:34,099
   

667
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:46,080
Go on.

668
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,549
Where's the original document?

669
00:57:50,959 --> 00:57:52,559
Well...

670
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:57,359
I got rid of it, Sir.

671
00:57:58,229 --> 00:58:00,100
You did?

672
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,600
Yes, Sir.

673
00:58:03,969 --> 00:58:07,069
If the existence of the paper company comes to the surface,

674
00:58:07,069 --> 00:58:12,050
someone will try to destroy all evidence.

675
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:17,879
That's why I took and saved the photos and got rid of the original document.

676
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:22,419
You made a wise choice, Mr. Yoon.

677
00:58:25,819 --> 00:58:29,159
I'd like to ask you something, Mr. Kim.

678
00:58:29,159 --> 00:58:31,900
About this paper company, Soonyang Micro.

679
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:33,960
I bet you...

680
00:58:37,169 --> 00:58:39,469
You knew about it, didn't you?

681
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:42,439
Pardon?

682
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,399
Answer wisely, Mr. Kim.

683
00:59:06,399 --> 00:59:08,229
Sir, I...

684
00:59:08,229 --> 00:59:12,300
If you knew but didn't report it, you either

685
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:17,539
do not approve of me as your boss or became greedy for that money.

686
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:22,749
If you didn't know about it, that's even worse.

687
00:59:23,549 --> 00:59:26,519
That means you're incompetent.

688
00:59:31,489 --> 00:59:33,819
So which one is it?

689
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,299
I apologize, Sir.

690
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:54,979
Either way, I now know that you've betrayed Soonyang.

691
01:00:18,769 --> 01:00:21,809
- Mr. Yoon. 
 - Yes, Sir.

692
01:00:21,809 --> 01:00:23,710
- You have a valid passport, right? 
 - Yes.

693
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:28,038
As of today, you're the senior finance manager of the Planning and Coordination Department.

694
01:00:28,038 --> 01:00:31,919
Go retrieve Soonyang's assets that have been siphoned off overseas.

695
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:36,350
That is your first mission as the senior finance manager.

696
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,960
I trust that you'll do a good job.

697
01:00:49,969 --> 01:00:52,700
I'll do my best, Sir.

698
01:01:21,999 --> 01:01:24,739
I've done some thinking, Father.

699
01:01:24,739 --> 01:01:27,500
You were right.

700
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:35,070
So now, I must have something to my name.

701
01:01:36,879 --> 01:01:41,280
The new Soonyang and its glowing future will be mine.

702
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:46,990
Soonyang's dark past shall perish with you, Father.

703
01:01:58,639 --> 01:02:05,769
Until the succession is completed, just keep on breathing like this.

704
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,200
Please sign here.

705
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:34,980
   

706
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:43,008
Okay. As you requested,

707
01:02:43,008 --> 01:02:47,690
we deposited 600 million dollars into your account, Sir.

708
01:02:48,790 --> 01:02:52,858
You can now withdraw the entire balance whenever you like.

709
01:02:53,830 --> 01:02:56,930
You became so wealthy at such a young age.

710
01:02:56,930 --> 01:02:59,959
Was it hard work or luck?

711
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:06,420
   

712
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:04,699
 Then let me hear what you think I should do. 

713
01:04:04,699 --> 01:04:08,199
 You should make a move before the prosecution does. 

714
01:04:08,199 --> 01:04:13,129
 Submit a declaration of business closure for the paper company and make sure 

715
01:04:13,129 --> 01:04:14,968
 Soonyang Corporation absorbs the assets. 

716
01:04:14,968 --> 01:04:17,410
 That's my suggestion, Sir. 

717
01:04:20,879 --> 01:04:23,709
Vice-Chairman Jin Seong Jun.

718
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:27,750
Do you think you can indict him?

719
01:05:09,029 --> 01:05:11,030
Hey, where are you going?

720
01:05:11,030 --> 01:05:13,430
Is this the right way?

721
01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:17,000
Don't worry. This is the shortcut.

722
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,400
Only we know. Taxi drivers.

723
01:05:37,719 --> 01:05:40,360
We're almost there.

724
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,060
Okay.

725
01:06:04,049 --> 01:06:06,750
One minute left.

726
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:08,519
Okay.

727
01:07:15,819 --> 01:07:18,819
Hey!

728
01:07:18,819 --> 01:07:21,330
Hey! Help!

729
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:22,990
Hey!

730
01:07:25,499 --> 01:07:28,729
Are you okay? Let me help you up.

731
01:07:28,729 --> 01:07:30,399
Sorry.

732
01:08:21,149 --> 01:08:23,590
The 600 million-dollar slush fund.

733
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:29,390
The slush fund created through Soonyang Micro.

734
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:34,699
I heard Yoon Hyeon Woo went to retrieve and launder the money.

735
01:08:36,069 --> 01:08:38,100
Ye Jun.

736
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:40,509
Who told you such nonsense?

737
01:08:40,509 --> 01:08:43,440
Our finance director.

738
01:08:44,309 --> 01:08:46,310
Do you want to meet him?

739
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:49,479
Director Kim.

740
01:09:05,929 --> 01:09:08,369
Then the slush fund...

741
01:09:09,269 --> 01:09:14,999
Once it's retrieved, can I have it?

742
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:23,350
Ye Jun, you've grown a lot.

743
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:30,279
Mr. Shin.

744
01:10:30,949 --> 01:10:33,180
Why are you here?

745
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,260
Mr. Shin.

746
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:50,270
Why in the world... Why are you doing this to me?

747
01:10:52,569 --> 01:10:54,969
You told me...

748
01:10:56,170 --> 01:11:03,639
to never disobey the higher-ups' orders or ask questions.

749
01:11:03,639 --> 01:11:07,620
You said I should never make my own judgment.

750
01:11:08,989 --> 01:11:14,719
I simply followed your advice.

751
01:11:19,559 --> 01:11:21,399
Let go.

752
01:11:21,399 --> 01:11:24,399
Let go!

753
01:11:26,439 --> 01:11:28,839
Who is it?

754
01:11:28,839 --> 01:11:31,739
Who ordered you to do this?

755
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:42,720
The person who needs this.

756
01:12:56,490 --> 01:13:01,230
♫   When the stars fall in the wind   ♫-

757
01:13:01,230 --> 01:13:02,640
♫   And the darkness comes rolling in   ♫

758
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,700
Do Jun, did you wake up?

759
01:13:05,410 --> 01:13:07,230
♫   Beautiful dreams of days past   ♫

760
01:13:07,230 --> 01:13:10,160
  What? 4-alpha?  

761
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:11,040
♫   Come to me with sadness  ♫

762
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:14,260
We're almost there. Time to wake up.

763
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:16,330
♫   Listening out for the sound of footsteps   ♫

764
01:13:16,339 --> 01:13:19,040
  That's 4-0.  

765
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:20,480
♫   I spent the night looking out the window   ♫

766
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:23,440
Hey, what are you doing?

767
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:24,740
♫   Even if you make my heart go numb   ♫

768
01:13:24,749 --> 01:13:27,720
Hey, then you must be 4-1.

769
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:29,989
What? "Hey?"

770
01:13:29,989 --> 01:13:31,570
You little...

771
01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:36,370
♫   I have a candle in my little hand   ♫

772
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:39,930
♫   If I can light it up tonight   ♫

773
01:13:39,930 --> 01:13:43,170
Am I alive?

774
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:49,740
♫   I have a candle in my little hand, if I can pray tonight   ♫

775
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:54,240
♫   Let’s have a candlelight party   ♫

776
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:57,110
♫   Let’s have a candlelight party   ♫

777
01:13:57,110 --> 01:14:00,090
Why do I look...

778
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:03,130
What happened to me?

779
01:14:03,130 --> 01:14:04,850
♫   Let’s have a candlelight party   ♫

780
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:06,630
Do you want to know?

781
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:08,380
Shall I tell you?

782
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:18,980
It's obvious at a single glance.

783
01:14:21,010 --> 01:14:22,980
Why?

784
01:14:23,879 --> 01:14:25,649
Why am I here?

785
01:14:25,649 --> 01:14:28,620
Why?

786
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:31,559
- Do Jun. 
 - What is it? What's wrong?

787
01:14:31,559 --> 01:14:33,920
It wasn't me.

788
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,820
I didn't do anything!

789
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:39,820
♫   I will repeat their name, stay up until night lightens   ♫

790
01:14:39,829 --> 01:14:41,370
Where is this place?

791
01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:42,599
    

792
01:14:42,599 --> 01:14:45,070
 The National Museum of Korea? 

793
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:49,410
 Today marks a historic moment when the demolition 

794
01:14:49,410 --> 01:14:51,839
 of the Japanese General Government Building commenced. 

795
01:14:51,839 --> 01:14:55,809
 Gyeongbokgung will be restored… 

796
01:14:55,809 --> 01:14:58,879
 That building was demolished in 1995. 

797
01:14:58,879 --> 01:15:00,979
 How is it still there? 

798
01:15:13,559 --> 01:15:15,829
Do Jun, are you all right?

799
01:15:15,829 --> 01:15:18,500
   

800
01:15:32,449 --> 01:15:35,450
   

801
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:39,960
Are you all right?

802
01:15:41,690 --> 01:15:44,360
Let's go say hi to Grandma.

803
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:46,129
Let's go.

804
01:15:49,469 --> 01:15:52,999
   

805
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,710
Hey, Yoon Ki.

806
01:15:57,710 --> 01:15:59,010
Hello.

807
01:15:59,010 --> 01:16:03,379
Oh, Yoon Ki. There you are.

808
01:16:03,379 --> 01:16:05,218
Hyeong Jun, Do Jun, uou're here, too.

809
01:16:05,218 --> 01:16:07,350
Come to Grandma!

810
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:08,448
Hello.

811
01:16:08,449 --> 01:16:10,189
My gosh. You're a big boy now.

812
01:16:10,189 --> 01:16:11,519
 This can't be. 

813
01:16:11,519 --> 01:16:14,659
Oh, my. You're a man now.

814
01:16:14,659 --> 01:16:16,789
 You people are... 

815
01:16:32,610 --> 01:16:34,979
Mr. Chairman is here.

816
01:16:49,489 --> 01:16:50,929
Welcome.

817
01:16:50,929 --> 01:16:53,500
Congratulations, Sir.

818
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,400
Congratulations.

819
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,429
Congratulations.

820
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:01,639
- Congratulations. 
 - Congratulations, Sir.

821
01:17:01,639 --> 01:17:03,340
Hello.

822
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:05,879
- Congratulations, Sir. 
 - Congratulations, Sir.

823
01:17:05,879 --> 01:17:08,610
 Chairman Jin Yang Cheol? 

824
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:28,930
 The founder of Soonyang. 

825
01:17:28,930 --> 01:17:31,069
 It's him. 

826
01:17:31,069 --> 01:17:33,400
 Chairman Jin Yang Cheol. 

827
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:44,990


828
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:49,780
    
 ♫  Come on, wake up  ♫

829
01:17:49,780 --> 01:17:52,550
♫  bring your destiny  ♫

830
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:57,690
♫ Boy can't you see, deny your gravity ♫

831
01:17:57,690 --> 01:18:02,680
♫  I'm flying, throwing off the fetters  ♫

832
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:08,940
♫  Boy can't you see, deny your gravity  ♫

833
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:14,030
♫  I can't stop the suffocating darkness  ♫

834
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:20,220
♫   I can't walk alone   ♫

835
01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:21,518
 Who am I? 

836
01:18:21,518 --> 01:18:23,390
 What kind of question is that? 

837
01:18:23,390 --> 01:18:28,160
 You are Jin Do Jun, the youngest grandchild of the Soonyang family. 

838
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,659
 This can't be. 

839
01:18:29,659 --> 01:18:31,389
 Does it make money? 

840
01:18:31,389 --> 01:18:32,959
 Will it help Soonyang? 

841
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:35,428
 Between DJ and YS, choose the one who's more likely to win. 

842
01:18:35,428 --> 01:18:36,599
 Who would that be? 

843
01:18:36,599 --> 01:18:40,069
 If it were me, I'd back Roh Tae Woo's campaign. 

844
01:18:40,069 --> 01:18:41,786
 Did you eavesdrop on the adults' conversation? 

845
01:18:41,786 --> 01:18:42,870
 You little... 

846
01:18:42,870 --> 01:18:43,938
 Throw salt after them. 

847
01:18:43,938 --> 01:18:45,978
 There are beggars everywhere. 

848
01:18:45,978 --> 01:18:48,179
 It's not a prank. It's true. 

849
01:18:48,179 --> 01:18:51,879
 By any chance, do you know what the future holds? 

850
01:18:51,879 --> 01:18:53,979
 Answer me! 

851
01:18:53,979 --> 01:19:00,520
 One of these people killed me. 

852
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:03,150
♫  throwing off the fetters  ♫

853
01:19:03,150 --> 01:19:08,560
♫  Boy can't you see, deny your gravity  ♫
