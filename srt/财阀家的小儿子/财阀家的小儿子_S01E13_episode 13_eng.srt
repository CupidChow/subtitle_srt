1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:08,010


2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,038
Mr. Lee.

3
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,969
Yes, Sir?

4
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:16,368
Was I wrong?

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,951
Pardon?

6
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:24,521
I thought cars would become like electronics.

7
00:00:24,521 --> 00:00:27,088
Was I wrong?

8
00:00:29,152 --> 00:00:31,953
Why would you be wrong?

9
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:38,432
Then why...

10
00:00:40,162 --> 00:00:45,673
When I say cars will be the future of Soonyang,

11
00:00:45,673 --> 00:00:48,103
why do people call it a delusion?

12
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,983
I'm convinced there's a chance,

13
00:00:53,983 --> 00:00:56,013
and they call me arbitrary.

14
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,483
I'm so serious about it that I can't give it up,

15
00:01:03,893 --> 00:01:06,123
and they call me obstinate.

16
00:01:11,233 --> 00:01:14,763
What did I do wrong...

17
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:20,802
that the very people who applauded me are using the same hands...

18
00:01:22,472 --> 00:01:25,673
to point at me in an accusatory manner?

19
00:01:27,113 --> 00:01:29,012
I don't get it.

20
00:01:33,252 --> 00:01:38,293
Why are my children at the forefront of that?

21
00:01:42,992 --> 00:01:45,463
Do you know why, Hang Jae?

22
00:01:45,463 --> 00:01:47,502
The answer to that.

23
00:01:49,432 --> 00:01:52,532
May I explain it, Grandfather?

24
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,310
To be honest,

25
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:04,449
a Soonyang car isn't exactly desirable.

26
00:02:04,449 --> 00:02:08,849
Performance, safety, competitive price, design,

27
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:12,019
and the name value, which is all that put together.

28
00:02:12,929 --> 00:02:15,759
The market is already

29
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:18,459
filled with better options.

30
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:23,300
Apollo is a compact car,

31
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,909
but from a customer's perspective, 5M won  ($5k)  is a lot of money.

32
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:32,910
To make people open their wallets to buy a Soonyang car, we need something more appealing.

33
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:37,979
If I were you, I'd sell that charm, not the car.

34
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:47,529
Will you delegate all rights and authority of Apollo to me?

35
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:50,389
I'll see to it that

36
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:54,130
no one says Soonyang Motors is your delusion,

37
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,730
that you're arbitrary

38
00:02:57,999 --> 00:03:00,940
or obstinate.

39
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:18,231
   

40
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,499
   

41
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:22,589
- He delegated all rights? 
 - Yes.

42
00:03:22,589 --> 00:03:24,660
What does Do Jun know about cars?

43
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,830
He also allocated the biggest marketing budget for the release of a new car.

44
00:03:32,499 --> 00:03:34,369
It's for the better, Vice-chairman.

45
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:39,517
If Apollo flops, Do Jun will have to shoulder the blame.

46
00:03:39,517 --> 00:03:42,279
How do you guarantee

47
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:44,680
Apollo will flop?

48
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,720
Soonyang Motors' future depends on Apollo, the new car. 
    

49
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,547
But this car

50
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:55,930
is pretty much predicted to fail.

51
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,572
You profit from selling compact cars by selling many for cheap.

52
00:04:00,572 --> 00:04:02,190
But Apollo is

53
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,500
made with expensive parts and materials, so it can't be sold at a cheap price.

54
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:12,239
And the domestic compact car market is already saturated so we can't sell many either.

55
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,379
So our plan

56
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,279
is to not

57
00:04:17,249 --> 00:04:19,320
sell the car.

58
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,790
The product you and I must sell

59
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,829
is this.

60
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:29,903
The FIFA World Cup?

61
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:31,829
What can we do with the World Cup?

62
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:36,699
Daeyoung Motors is the World Cup's official sponsor. What can we do so late in the game?

63
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:38,699
Does he think we'll sell more as a host country?

64
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:41,610
Our team won't even make it through the preliminary round.

65
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,210
Will he give a few cars away? Say ten?

66
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:49,410
If and when our team scores their first win, we give out 100 cars.

67
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,458
If we reach the Round of 16, it'll go up to 400. At the quarterfinals, we give out 500 cars.

68
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:57,990
And if we reach the semifinals, which is a long-held dream...

69
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,189
   

70
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:02,459
It'll be 1,000 cars.

71
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:05,030
- As if! 
 - Semifinals? No way!

72
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:09,970
The huge numbers will get us noticed in the early stages.

73
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:14,539
The higher up our team goes in World Cup, the more interested people will become in our new car, Apollo.

74
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:16,316
So the promotion is organized

75
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,939
with the assumption our national soccer team

76
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:21,210
reaches the semifinals?

77
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,324
- That's right. 
 - What if we don't make it?

78
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:28,328
The semifinals? I say it's unlikely we'll even survive the Round of 16.

79
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,397
We can't even reach the Round of 16, let alone the semifinals.

80
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:32,720
This is preposterous.

81
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,690
It is.

82
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,430
And then the public

83
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,800
will equate the memories of desperate cheering and praying with our new car.

84
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:45,640
But if, and it's a huge if,

85
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:50,639
our team miraculously manages to reach the semifinal?

86
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,510
The public

87
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:57,750
will equate Apollo with the overwhelming feeling of victory.

88
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:06,249
We can't bring down the car's factory price, but we can reduce the customers' burden of expenses.

89
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,200
I'd like to make an unprecedented 48-month installment plan.

90
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,976
Actually, a 60-month long-term plan.

91
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:18,845
And I'd like it to be done jointly with Soonyang Card.

92
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:22,449
Soonyang Motors will improve Apollo's price competitiveness,

93
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:25,785
and Soonyang Card can make more on installment interest and charges.

94
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,988
It's a win-win deal.

95
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:31,491
We had an internal discussion based on your official notice,

96
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,889
and we decided to reject Soonyang Motors' offer.

97
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:38,020
I have another appointment. Bye.

98
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,929
Sir. I'm really sorry.

99
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,273
May I ask why you're rejecting the offer?

100
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:49,639
Soonyang Card also entered the market late.

101
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:54,770
To gather more credit card members, we concluded it would be better to join forces with

102
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,882
a better-known affiliate. I apologize.

103
00:06:57,882 --> 00:06:59,539
Wait.

104
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,650
Is that affiliate

105
00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:06,380
- Soonyang Electronics? 
 - Bye.

106
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,519
If it's Electronics, is Vice-chairman Jin Young Ki behind it?

107
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:17,604
This is an all-out war for them, too.

108
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,730
Then we should also face them all-out, too.

109
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,074
You bet.

110
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:24,300
Miracle should take over Soonyang Card.

111
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,800
You bet.

112
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:29,182
We take over what?

113
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,809
We need management rights to a credit card company.

114
00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:35,786
Apollo is a compact car, and Soonyang Motors' brand power is minuscule.

115
00:07:35,786 --> 00:07:39,125
If the public rejects it right away, there's no coming back.

116
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,290
To increase sales in the early stages,

117
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,389
we need a card company to provide a long-term plan.

118
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:47,789
Should we look for another card company?

119
00:07:48,429 --> 00:07:50,859
The World Cup will be over by the time we negotiate

120
00:07:50,859 --> 00:07:53,530
the details and sign the papers.

121
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,570
Hello, Grandfather.

122
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,220
Grandfather.

123
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,329
I brought you some tea.

124
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:23,160
You should have it before it cools.

125
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,870
Don't go. Stay.

126
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,739
Stay until the song finishes.

127
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,439
I looked up the song you like

128
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:39,740
and played it for you on purpose.

129
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:45,779
Stay until the song ends.

130
00:08:48,689 --> 00:08:52,119
Don't worry about Yoon Ki.

131
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,999
I'm...

132
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:06,969
planning to leave Yoon Ki's son

133
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,310
all of Soonyang Group.

134
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:16,449
Yoon Ki...

135
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,519
Yoon Ki's mom, you must have

136
00:09:26,219 --> 00:09:29,760
resented me a great deal.

137
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,400
Hello, Grandfather.

138
00:09:41,109 --> 00:09:42,739
Hello.

139
00:09:53,349 --> 00:09:55,189
- Grandfather. 
 - Yes?

140
00:09:55,189 --> 00:09:58,960
I have something to report. Shall we go to your study?

141
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,900
Let's go. Give me this.

142
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:19,140
Okay. Call me once you've scheduled his next appointment, Director Jung.

143
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,280
Bye.

144
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:27,150
I must've caused trouble. Did I?

145
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:30,219
Don't worry. You haven't.

146
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,240
Hyeon Min.

147
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:56,923
I'll bring the chairman his tea.

148
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:59,420
You can focus on the other stuff.

149
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,089
- Yes, Grandmother. 
 - Okay.

150
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,720
Hyeon Min.

151
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,929
Yes?

152
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:15,799
Did the chairman say anything special to you?

153
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,099
No, he didn't.

154
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,309
He just listened to the music.

155
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:27,480
I see. You can go downstairs then.

156
00:11:33,219 --> 00:11:37,789
Grandfather, did you have something to say to me?

157
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:45,769
The event you're planning for Apollo's release.

158
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:47,570
Yes.

159
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,970
Let's forget all about it.

160
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,609
Are you serious, Grandfather?

161
00:11:55,609 --> 00:11:57,579
Why?

162
00:11:57,579 --> 00:12:01,249
Do you think your grandfather is out of his mind?

163
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:04,520
Shall I recite the multiplication table?

164
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,150
No.

165
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,890
I'm back, Sir.

166
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,189
- Mr. Lee. 
 - Yes.

167
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:16,790
I called Do Jun so he'd arrive when you did.

168
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:20,707
Mr. Lee, what's going on?

169
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,770
Well...

170
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:25,739
Soonyang Motors.

171
00:12:28,469 --> 00:12:31,109
I'm going to sell it.

172
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:35,979
I heard there are some Chinese

173
00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:40,249
and Indian companies showing interest.

174
00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:42,620
When someone is interested,

175
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:46,260
I should sell it and get as much as I can.

176
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,329
If we begin negotiations now, he thinks

177
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:54,972
the media and shareholders will have no reason to reject you as CEO of the financial holding company.

178
00:12:54,972 --> 00:12:58,369
He told me a few days ago to find prospective buyers.

179
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,870
I just rushed back from a meeting.

180
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:06,010
Then the world will remember Soonyang Motors

181
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,909
as Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's

182
00:13:10,819 --> 00:13:13,420
terrible mistake.

183
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,229
Grandfather.

184
00:13:31,439 --> 00:13:34,540
If this is about the public sentiment,

185
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,784
once Apollo is released

186
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:40,479
and the World Cup Semifinal Event ends,

187
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,510
the public sentiment will shift right away.

188
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,179
The time is coming soon.

189
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:51,531
You said that cars are electronics.

190
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:57,160
The day will come when the world will acknowledge your foresight.

191
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,430
Don't you want to see it, too?

192
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,899
Have you seen it?

193
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,610
You speak as confidently as if you saw it happen.

194
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:14,810
The World Cup semifinals?

195
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:18,949
They barely won a match, let alone they'd reach the Round of 16,

196
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:21,250
and they'll reach the semifinals?

197
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:27,489
Do you want me to believe something that sounds like it came out of a dream?

198
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,030
- Mr. Lee. 
 - Yes?

199
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:36,270
Do you think this makes sense?

200
00:14:37,099 --> 00:14:40,640
How about a wager then?

201
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,520
If the Korean soccer team doesn't reach the semifinals,

202
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,357
you can sell Soonyang Motors right away.

203
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:56,879
But if our team reaches the semifinals,

204
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:01,490
then do as I say and never sell Soonyang Motors.

205
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,800
Are you up for the wager?

206
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,490
There.

207
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:33,919
He's not the type to make a useless proposition.

208
00:15:36,189 --> 00:15:42,259
Do Jun must pity me.

209
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:49,610
Of all my children and grandchildren,

210
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:53,440
the only one who cares about me

211
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,309
is Do Jun.

212
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:04,250
Hang Jae. This won't do.

213
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:08,359
I should revise my written will.

214
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:11,530
Your written will?

215
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:17,599
The 2002 Korea-Japan FIFA World Cup.

216
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:20,170
I announce the games open.

217
00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:33,749
   

218
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:52,040
   

219
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,609
Make the call right now.

220
00:16:53,609 --> 00:16:55,940
Have all the Soonyang Motor banners and posters taken down.

221
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,909
Make sure every single one is taken down right...

222
00:17:00,609 --> 00:17:03,750
There's a typo, you punk!

223
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:11,320
   

224
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:18,559
   

225
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,008
Our team's first match is against Poland,

226
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:24,270
and it happens this evening.

227
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,312
It shouldn't say, "Congratulations on the first win."

228
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:29,109
It should say, "We wish for the first win."

229
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:30,850
I know.

230
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:35,385
- What? 
 - It's an advertisement to make people do a double take.

231
00:17:35,385 --> 00:17:37,980
Oh, no, it's not.

232
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,820
It's to cheer on our team so they really do win.

233
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,490
It...It...It wasn't a typo?

234
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,919
Are you conning the whole country?

235
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,190
Since when did you want to become a scoundrel who lies to the nation?

236
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,460
Don't worry, Hyung Hyeong Jun. We'll win today for sure.

237
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,441
We'll win? How?

238
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:58,240
How can we win with a coach like Five-Zero?

239
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,879
You can't call the coach that.

240
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:03,010
Should I call him "Mr. Hiddink"?

241
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:07,010
That guy Five-Zero doesn't know our team at all.

242
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:10,050
Instead of Asia's greatest striker, the eagle Choi Yong Soo,

243
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,849
how could he pick Ahn Jung Hwan?

244
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:13,690
Does he think you play soccer with good looks?

245
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,595
He brought a load of people we've never heard of.

246
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:16,919
Park Ji Sung?

247
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:20,559
Who on earth is Park Ji Sung? Park Ji Sung!

248
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,835
Hyung Hyeong Jun, don't you dare...

249
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:25,460
- It's Ji Sung Park. 
 - "Ji Sung Park?"

250
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,639
Is he from overseas?

251
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,829
- Why do I even bother? 
 - Unbelievable.

252
00:18:29,829 --> 00:18:34,469
At this rate, you'll end up saying he'll play in the Premier League.

253
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,440
   

254
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:44,119
What did I say? I said we'd win!

255
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:46,919
I said this would be our first win!

256
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,620
I heard you say "Five-Zero."

257
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,759
And something about playing with good looks.

258
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:52,190
I did, too.

259
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,930
Good looks help you win soccer.

260
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,490
Face-reading is a science.

261
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,200
Look at Park Ji Sung. It's all over his face.

262
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,770
Captain Korea!

263
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,169
Let's drink!

264
00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:04,839
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

265
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,970
- Go, Korea! 
 - Go, Korea!

266
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,269
 It's the kick-off, and the whistle was blown. 

267
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,279
 - That's it! 
 - Yes. 

268
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,250
 - Shoot! 
 - Shoot! 

269
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,250
 - Goal! 
 - Goal! 

270
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,780
 - Park Ji Sung! 
 - Park Ji Sung! He does it! 

271
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,690
 - We got there eventually. 
 - Park Ji Sung did it. 

272
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,119
 - The match is over. 
 - It is. 
   

273
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:27,990
 Our long-time dream came true! 

274
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,930
   

275
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,970
   

276
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,109
   

277
00:19:43,109 --> 00:19:45,139
 The new Apollo! 

278
00:19:45,139 --> 00:19:47,149
- Go, Korea! 
 - Go, Korea!

279
00:19:47,149 --> 00:19:48,710
We can do it!

280
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,109
   

281
00:19:50,109 --> 00:19:52,549
- Go, Korea! 
 - Go, Korea!

282
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:55,720
 Team Korea is entering the pitch. 

283
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,790
 Nice! 

284
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,760
 - Shoot! 
 - Shoot! 

285
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,990
 - It's an equalizer. 
 - Goal! 

286
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,059
 They've opened up. Ahn Jung Hwan kicks the ball. 

287
00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:06,460
 - The match is over. 
 - Goal! 

288
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,869
 The match is over. 

289
00:20:07,869 --> 00:20:09,770
 - Ahn Jung Hwan! 
 - The match is over. 

290
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,069
   

291
00:20:12,069 --> 00:20:15,410
 - He did it! Ahn Jung Hwan. 
 - The match is over. 

292
00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:17,480
- He's here. 
 - That's him!

293
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,680
- Mr. Jin! 
 - How about an interview?

294
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,280
Did you predict this and create the Soonyang Motors campaign?

295
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,680
Was it your idea to use the World Cup?

296
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,320
Soonyang Motors' Apollo is gaining popularity. Did you expect this?

297
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,220
Do you think we'll reach the semifinals?

298
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,063
Will you continue with the predictions and events?

299
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,420
How do you think the next match will go?

300
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,230
Well...

301
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:42,129
You can see my reply in the next Soonyang Motors' ad.

302
00:20:42,129 --> 00:20:44,969
 Dreams come true. 

303
00:20:44,969 --> 00:20:48,069
 Team Korea attempts the impossible. 

304
00:20:48,069 --> 00:20:51,384
 We congratulate them on the win in the quarterfinals. 

305
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:54,050
 As you run toward your dreams, 

306
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:57,850
 Apollo will run with you. 

307
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:02,550
 Apollo, Soonyang Motors. 

308
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:08,889
Do Jun has lots of talents.

309
00:21:08,889 --> 00:21:10,960
It won't last.

310
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,272
He used the World Cup fever to carry the Apollo name.

311
00:21:16,272 --> 00:21:21,340
It's not enough to say he landed safely in the market.

312
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,319
What is the matter with you?

313
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:40,320
I apologize, Vice-chairman.

314
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,568
What? Apollo will flop?

315
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:45,204
The compact car market is saturated?

316
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:48,407
If you have eyes, look! If you have ears, listen!

317
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:51,777
Use that stupid mouth of yours and blabber again.

318
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:57,709
That Apollo will be Soonyang Motors' greatest failure!

319
00:21:57,709 --> 00:21:59,640
   

320
00:22:00,609 --> 00:22:03,780
   
   

321
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:09,150
Everyone!

322
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:12,619
Apollo is now mentioned in the Guinness Book of Records!

323
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,059
Congratulations.

324
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:17,630
Thank you.

325
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:22,629
Apollo is now the compact car

326
00:22:22,629 --> 00:22:25,270
to sell the most in the shortest time,

327
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,599
and even if you buy one now,

328
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:29,409
you might not even get it next spring.

329
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:36,309
I owe all this to your hard work.

330
00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:38,720
You all did great. Thank you.

331
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:43,049
If we beat Spain today, it means we will reach the semifinals.

332
00:22:43,049 --> 00:22:48,159
Will the next Apollo ad predict our team will reach the final?

333
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,930
- It should. 
 - Why not?

334
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,904
- No. 
 - Let's go all the way.

335
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:55,806
The Apollo ad will end with the semifinals.

336
00:22:55,806 --> 00:22:57,176
- Why? 
 - Too bad.

337
00:22:57,176 --> 00:23:02,211
Are you saying you think our team won't make it to the final?

338
00:23:02,211 --> 00:23:05,110
There's no other reason for that.

339
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:12,187
The World Cup Event's purpose was to improve brand recognition and popularity.

340
00:23:12,187 --> 00:23:14,520
We went way over our goal.

341
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,819
What a pity.

342
00:23:15,819 --> 00:23:20,590
In other words, I used up all the marketing funds my grandfather gave me.

343
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:23,289
I see.

344
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:29,873
When my grandfather sees this, I bet he'll say it was money well spent.

345
00:23:29,873 --> 00:23:31,940
I'll go and show this off.

346
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,339
- Enjoy your feast. 
 - Okay!

347
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:40,853
Do Jun is quite the entrepreneur.

348
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:42,950
He brags way too much.

349
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,579
We're up against Spain.

350
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:47,919
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona.

351
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:53,659
How are we to beat soccer powerhouse Spain to reach the semifinals?

352
00:23:53,659 --> 00:23:56,330
That borders on a miracle.

353
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,460
It does.

354
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,760
Hang Jae, you tell me.

355
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,740
Do you think our team stands a chance?

356
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,669
I agree with you, Sir.

357
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,880
Do you?

358
00:24:17,109 --> 00:24:20,919
You do, too, don't you? We won't reach the semifinals.

359
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:34,239
Even if you lose the wager,

360
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:38,399
I also wish that a miracle will visit

361
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:41,709
our soccer team and Soonyang Motors.

362
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:49,585
Since it's a special match, why don't you watch it privately with Do Jun?

363
00:24:49,585 --> 00:24:53,379
I'd like to watch the game with my family, too.

364
00:24:53,379 --> 00:24:55,050
Yes.

365
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,590
I agree with you.

366
00:25:00,619 --> 00:25:02,729
Oh, dear.

367
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,980
 My grandmother is so attentive. 

368
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:30,290
 She won't even let you bring him tea. 

369
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:35,090
 She won't let anyone else bring him his medicine either. 

370
00:25:38,859 --> 00:25:41,259
 What is that medicine anyway? 

371
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:45,739
 Don't you want to know? 

372
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,689
Grandfather.

373
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:08,260
Grandmother said it's time you take your medicine.

374
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,899
I'll get it for you.

375
00:26:10,899 --> 00:26:13,759
Just tell me where it is.

376
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,800
It's over there.

377
00:26:16,669 --> 00:26:19,469
Where it's always kept.

378
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:42,059
- Welcome home. 
 - Thanks.

379
00:27:13,389 --> 00:27:15,290
Give me that.

380
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:22,107
I don't want to believe my grandson married

381
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:25,040
someone who lays her hand on an elder's item without permission.

382
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,569
Now.

383
00:27:33,639 --> 00:27:35,809
You asked me

384
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,650
if Grandfather said anything special to me.

385
00:27:44,389 --> 00:27:46,590
Now I remember.

386
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,530
Yoon Ki's

387
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,130
mom.

388
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:01,570
He said he'll give Soonyang to Yoon Ki's son.

389
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:08,879
You and I are in the same boat.

390
00:28:08,879 --> 00:28:11,350
So I'll tell you especially.

391
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:18,290
Sim Gallery has a lot of replicas, Grandmother.

392
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:23,190
If you ever need a painting,

393
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:27,400
you should tell me next time.

394
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:31,169
Okay.

395
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,940
Thank you.

396
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,109
Chairman... Chairman Jin.

397
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:16,880
Chairman Jin.

398
00:29:17,819 --> 00:29:20,580
Chairman... Chairman Jin.

399
00:29:28,889 --> 00:29:33,329
Grandfather.

400
00:29:33,329 --> 00:29:36,030
- Grandfather.
- What's wrong?

401
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,630
Grandfather.

402
00:29:59,533 --> 00:30:04,468
 Chairman Jin Yang Cheol of Soonyang Group passed away at the age of 76. 

403
00:30:04,468 --> 00:30:07,506
 Chairman Jin led Soonyang Group for 32 years. 

404
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:10,530
 With his spirit to challenge and constant will to innovate, 

405
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:15,544
 he turned Soonyang into a global brand that is recognized worldwide. 

406
00:30:15,544 --> 00:30:19,540
 Politics and financial world say he is the man who led 

407
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,349
 Korea's shining economical development 

408
00:30:21,349 --> 00:30:25,580
 and the big figure in contemporary history. They've expressed deep sorrow. 

409
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:31,361
 Meanwhile, the family of the deceased said in the message to the public 

410
00:30:31,361 --> 00:30:35,199
 they'll respect the deceased's wish for a harmonious family and righteous management, 

411
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:40,500
 Soonyang Group will become a company that returns the favor to the nation. 

412
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,430
 As Chairman Jin Yang Cheol passed away, 

413
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:49,040
 the financial world is paying attention to who will become Soonyang Group's next chairman. 

414
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,550
It must've been troublesome, CEO Jin.

415
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:08,320
Not at all. I enjoyed it.

416
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,160
I ended up missing my grandfather's funeral.

417
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,930
His only granddaughter is causing trouble to the end.

418
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,470
I'll take you to Jeongsimjae.

419
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,950
You should say hello to your mother first.

420
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,680
I guess I'm in Seoul now.

421
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,982
Hearing about Jeongsimjae gives me a headache.

422
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:26,139
Give it to me. I'll carry it.

423
00:31:26,139 --> 00:31:28,909
The younger one should do it.

424
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,717
Ye Jun is here.

425
00:31:33,717 --> 00:31:36,428
- Long time no see, Ye Jun. 
 - Hi, Auntie.

426
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:39,089
Oh, sweetie. My baby.

427
00:31:39,089 --> 00:31:42,460
I'm sorry, Grandma. I'm too late.

428
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:46,399
I'm sure your grandfather would understand.

429
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,099
I heard the earthquake was so big

430
00:31:49,099 --> 00:31:51,399
that the airport was closed and all the flights were canceled.

431
00:31:51,399 --> 00:31:53,169
It's a natural disaster.

432
00:31:53,169 --> 00:31:55,013
No human can stop it.

433
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:57,740
You should take her passport away first.

434
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:02,110
What's the point if she's the icon of noblesse oblige that represents Soonyang?

435
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:06,320
- What's the point if the UN chose her as the next female leader? 
 - Oh, mom...

436
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,950
She's ruining her health and making elders worry.

437
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:14,090
She's right, Ye Jun. You should let your underlings do overseas volunteer work

438
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:17,959
and take care of the charity. The labor doesn't cost much.

439
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:20,559
The UV rays are terrible for your skin.

440
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,841
My goodness. You got freckles.

441
00:32:22,841 --> 00:32:25,869
Even makeup couldn't cover it.

442
00:32:25,869 --> 00:32:29,209
You and auntie haven't changed.

443
00:32:29,848 --> 00:32:33,839
The rumor said Jeongsimjae had a big change

444
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:36,050
because of Grandfather's will.

445
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:43,719
Did he have to back stab his children again with his will?

446
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:48,490
Our father is just amazing!

447
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:03,869
You don't know, either?

448
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:09,679
I only followed Chairman Jin's orders.

449
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:15,124
Chairman Jin said he'd change his will, and I only followed the procedure.

450
00:33:15,124 --> 00:33:16,720
Hyungnim Hang Jae.

451
00:33:18,019 --> 00:33:19,719
A farmer

452
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:24,729
can't be a landowner just because he's good at farming.

453
00:33:24,729 --> 00:33:29,530
The son who inherits the land becomes the landowner.

454
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:34,513
In the past ten years, the one

455
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:37,410
who planned Soonyang's succession structure next to my father

456
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,709
was you, Mr. Lee.

457
00:33:39,709 --> 00:33:44,319
And you're saying you don't know why my father changed his will?

458
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:46,550
Do you think that makes sense?

459
00:33:47,249 --> 00:33:49,520
If you want to avoid the rain and wind

460
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:54,320
under the shelter of Soonyang's eaves for the rest of your life,

461
00:33:55,129 --> 00:33:58,930
answer me. Why did my father

462
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:03,570
change his will?

463
00:34:07,069 --> 00:34:09,110
Chairman Jin said

464
00:34:11,169 --> 00:34:15,179
it was his last choice for Soonyang.

465
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,649
I will begin now.

466
00:34:20,649 --> 00:34:23,550
   

467
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:27,789
The will you're about to see today

468
00:34:27,789 --> 00:34:31,269
was changed on May 30, 2002,

469
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,759
as Chairman Jin ordered.

470
00:34:33,759 --> 00:34:38,269
The edited version has been notarized already.

471
00:34:38,939 --> 00:34:41,770
- Lawyer Park, shall we start? 
 - Yes.

472
00:34:51,749 --> 00:34:56,490
   

473
00:35:08,729 --> 00:35:11,429
 This will is in effect 

474
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:15,939
 upon Chairman Jin's death. 

475
00:35:17,169 --> 00:35:20,416
For his eldest grandson, CEO Jin Seong Jun of Soonyang Venture Investment,

476
00:35:20,416 --> 00:35:23,350
three percent of Soonyang Insurance shares.

477
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:28,380
To his wife, CEO Mo Hyeon Min, he left the chairwoman of the board position of Soonyang Culture Foundation,

478
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:31,120
which has 0.3 percent of Soonyang Insurance shares.

479
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:35,219
To CEO Jin Ye Jun of Soonyang Culture Exchange Foundation, who is absent here,

480
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:37,459
he left two percent of Soonyang Insurance shares.

481
00:35:37,459 --> 00:35:42,159
And to Jin Hyeong Jun, he left 82,645m² land

482
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:45,470
near Unjung-dong, West Pangyo, Gyeonggi Province.

483
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,069
Lastly,

484
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,969
to his youngest grandson, Jin Do Jun,

485
00:35:56,379 --> 00:35:58,210
he left nothing.

486
00:36:13,999 --> 00:36:15,700
About Father,

487
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:19,978
when he said he'd make Do Jun the CEO of the holding company,

488
00:36:19,978 --> 00:36:24,069
he planned to give Soonyang to Do Jun.

489
00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:28,810
Then it would only makes sense if he gave him Soonyang Insurance shares, too.

490
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,309
Don't you think?

491
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,690
This is what I think.

492
00:36:38,189 --> 00:36:39,919
Father is

493
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,190
giving us a chance.

494
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,700
One last time.

495
00:36:51,899 --> 00:36:55,369
That's only if the will is everything there is.

496
00:36:58,016 --> 00:37:00,251
What if he left a special inheritance

497
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:02,180
to Do Jun

498
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,180
without leaving it in his will?

499
00:37:05,749 --> 00:37:10,119
The night the will was revealed,

500
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:14,019
Do Jun visited your grandfather.

501
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,810
The only person who stayed by grandfather's deathbed

502
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:33,539
was Do Jun.

503
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:38,080
You know all about Do Jun.

504
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,319
You should get a degree for that.

505
00:37:43,249 --> 00:37:45,089
If you have something to say, be straightforward.

506
00:37:45,089 --> 00:37:48,560
Don't be sarcastic or twist my words.

507
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:54,560
I'm the only one who is properly on your side in this world.

508
00:37:56,129 --> 00:37:57,429
Are you sure

509
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,900
you're on my side?

510
00:38:02,669 --> 00:38:06,339
Is there anything more to our marriage?

511
00:38:14,649 --> 00:38:18,989
I'm thinking of living more like your grandmother.

512
00:38:19,689 --> 00:38:21,959
My grandmother?

513
00:38:24,189 --> 00:38:27,129
Will you be a devoted wife?

514
00:38:31,069 --> 00:38:33,600
Is that why you brought up Do Jun?

515
00:38:36,669 --> 00:38:40,339
No one knows

516
00:38:40,339 --> 00:38:42,879
what happened in the hospital that night.

517
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:52,319
The will was revealed when your grandfather was alive.

518
00:38:52,319 --> 00:38:54,660
Did you make an objection?

519
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,520
Or file a lawsuit for your portion?

520
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,560
- I've never thought about it. 
 - Why not?

521
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,069
Because it's your grandfather's inheritance? Is it a family issue now?

522
00:39:02,069 --> 00:39:06,742
- CEO Oh! 
 - This is a business between you, me, and Rachel here.

523
00:39:06,742 --> 00:39:12,180
Due to your grandfather's will, we just lost 2.6 trillion won  ($2.6B) .

524
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,140
By any chance,

525
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,950
is there a hidden agreement aside from the will?

526
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:18,722
- CEO Oh! 
 - Then how else do you expect me to understand?

527
00:39:18,722 --> 00:39:22,060
He didn't leave anything to his favorite grandson.

528
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,720
I don't know. I don't know why he did that!

529
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,120
Why didn't he? Chairman Jin Yang Cheol... No.

530
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:32,999
I can never guess what that mean old man was thinking.

531
00:39:32,999 --> 00:39:36,630
I've thought about it every day. I thought about it a million times over and over again.

532
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:40,309
But I have no idea. Why did he say he'd give me Soonyang?

533
00:39:40,309 --> 00:39:44,770
Was he lying? If he wasn't, why did he change his will again?

534
00:39:49,879 --> 00:39:52,479
How are you supposed to understand this situation?

535
00:39:53,278 --> 00:39:55,519
That's what I want to ask.

536
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:57,650
What on earth

537
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:00,790
was I to Grandfather?

538
00:40:03,129 --> 00:40:05,190
If possible,

539
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:10,470
the person who wants to chase him to purgatory and get the answer

540
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:13,439
is me, not you.

541
00:40:24,149 --> 00:40:25,780
 Do Jun. 

542
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:29,389
 Do you think 

543
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,219
 I trust you? 

544
00:40:34,459 --> 00:40:37,790
 Do you want to be in charge? 

545
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,930
 Soonyang Financial Group. 

546
00:40:42,629 --> 00:40:45,069
 I plan to give it to you. 

547
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:48,100
 I hope 

548
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:50,909
 you achieve it for sure. 

549
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,008
 We won the soccer game. 

550
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:14,759
 I told you we'd beat Spain 

551
00:42:14,759 --> 00:42:17,760
 and make it to the semifinals. 

552
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,729
 I... 

553
00:42:25,069 --> 00:42:27,239
 won the bet. 

554
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:47,450
The publishing company said they need a reference for Chairman Jin's biography.

555
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:52,350
So we decided to include his calligraphy.

556
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:54,559
Chairman Jin would say

557
00:43:54,599 --> 00:44:01,129
Soonyang will be enough for his trace in this world.

558
00:44:02,169 --> 00:44:04,100
It wasn't my idea to publish the book.

559
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,840
You'll have to deal with all the nagging.

560
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:13,039
It'll be a meaningful gift to those who respect him.

561
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:15,879
Oh, dear.

562
00:44:15,879 --> 00:44:18,649
He was such a wonderful man outside,

563
00:44:18,649 --> 00:44:22,894
but he couldn't be meaner to his children to the end.

564
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:29,429
He should've given all the holding company shares to one of his children.

565
00:44:29,429 --> 00:44:31,989
That way, we can defend the management rights.

566
00:44:32,629 --> 00:44:38,669
If they ever fight for shares or management rights...

567
00:44:42,769 --> 00:44:45,670
- Hyeon Min. 
 - Yes.

568
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:49,210
Do you have Chairman Jin's calligraphy ready yet?

569
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:51,489
His bold writing for his biography,

570
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:54,249
and slender writing for his critical biography will be better.

571
00:44:54,249 --> 00:44:57,850
I separated them into two. Well, then.

572
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,076
You must be worried.

573
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:14,769
I shouldn't stop there.

574
00:45:14,769 --> 00:45:17,540
I should play my role as a mother.

575
00:45:19,209 --> 00:45:21,239
I plan to

576
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:26,719
help my children, Mr. Lee.

577
00:45:28,649 --> 00:45:30,650
Does that mean...

578
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:34,860
Practice makes perfect.

579
00:45:36,501 --> 00:45:41,760
The times I spent as a wife of Soonyang taught me.

580
00:45:44,344 --> 00:45:46,399
I'm not sure if we were alike because we were married

581
00:45:46,399 --> 00:45:49,100
or became alike after gossiping about him.

582
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,979
I never thought I'd act like your father.

583
00:45:52,979 --> 00:45:55,410
But this day has come.

584
00:45:57,157 --> 00:46:00,950
I gossiped about him so much for lining up his children

585
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:04,020
with some money he had.

586
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:07,919
So what then? Will you do the same now?

587
00:46:07,919 --> 00:46:10,930
Go ahead and show us.

588
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:15,671
Mr. Lee told me that you'd be able to safely assume control

589
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:20,599
of the holding company if I were to help out.

590
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:28,280
The 17 percent of the Soonyang Insurance shares.

591
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,449
I own them.

592
00:46:35,819 --> 00:46:39,889
You own the shares? How come none of us knew?

593
00:46:39,889 --> 00:46:42,590
Mom, don't tell us you have your own slush fund.

594
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:44,889
Have you been collecting kickbacks?

595
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:48,399
You're just like Father.

596
00:46:48,399 --> 00:46:50,841
Look at you blindsiding your own children, just like Father.

597
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:55,809
That money... I've been putting it aside for myself as a reward

598
00:46:55,809 --> 00:46:57,870
for putting up with your father for fifty years.

599
00:46:57,870 --> 00:47:01,009
Then who is number one on your list?

600
00:47:02,109 --> 00:47:04,479
First come, first served?

601
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:11,024
The one who can and will take good care of the rest of the family will get the money.

602
00:47:11,024 --> 00:47:14,519
Don't be calculating because it'll get you nowhere.

603
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:16,979
Stay out of trouble and wait patiently.

604
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:26,469
I'll trust that I got my message across.

605
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:36,180
Whether that 17 percent goes to Hyungnim Young Ki or comes to me,

606
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:39,350
it'll be hard for Do Jun to make the company his.

607
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:43,089
Who do you think Mother will choose? Hyungnim Young Ki or me?

608
00:47:44,762 --> 00:47:46,919
What about me?

609
00:47:46,919 --> 00:47:48,232
Am I not her child?

610
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:50,089
Hey, you are...

611
00:47:50,089 --> 00:47:53,504
Even if you get all of Mom's shares, you won't have 30 percent.

612
00:47:53,504 --> 00:47:57,700
Hey, you'd better stay out of this.

613
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,100
Just figure out how you can walk away with a handsome tip.

614
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,700
Okay, fine.

615
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:05,010
Then I shall go figure out which cards to sell.

616
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:06,540
Hey.

617
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:13,955
Unlike Grandfather, Grandma always believed that the eldest son should get everything.

618
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:17,962
Today, she went on about taking good care of the family.

619
00:48:17,962 --> 00:48:20,589
Isn't that something people normally say to the eldest son?

620
00:48:20,589 --> 00:48:22,729
Should I come to Jeongsimjae every day starting tomorrow?

621
00:48:22,729 --> 00:48:25,260
Jeong Rae is with Mother 24-7.

622
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:27,429
It makes me feel so anxious.

623
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:32,030
Of course, Mother is on your side.

624
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:36,109
She always trusted and complimented you in front of Father.

625
00:48:36,109 --> 00:48:38,240
That's...

626
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,910
That's because I'm her ugly duckling.

627
00:48:42,649 --> 00:48:47,919
I suppose Grandmother really doesn't want the holding company to end up in Do Jun's hands.

628
00:48:47,919 --> 00:48:52,420
This family feud began when Father broke

629
00:48:52,459 --> 00:48:55,890
the rule of primogeniture because of Do Jun.

630
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:00,899
Sorry?

631
00:49:01,499 --> 00:49:04,041
All the Soonyang Insurance shares that I own.

632
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:06,169
I'll hand them over to Do Jun.

633
00:49:06,169 --> 00:49:11,810
In turn, I want that brat to return the department store shares that he took from me.

634
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:19,720
I'll ask Do Jun and let you know what he says.

635
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,779
You seem really relaxed.

636
00:49:21,779 --> 00:49:23,989
I thought you'd bite it right away.

637
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:32,359
Weren't you trying to play a retired king at Soonyang, using Do Jun?

638
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:38,399
Then it's not time for you to be relaxed like this right now.

639
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:46,440
Father, have some coffee.

640
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:54,080
How many shares of the holding company

641
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:57,920
do you think you can gather before the shareholders' meeting?

642
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:02,660
It's not going to be easy.

643
00:50:03,629 --> 00:50:05,560
Do Jun.

644
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:10,200
The footage from the camera in your grandfather's hospital room.

645
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,030
Let's go public with it.

646
00:50:13,277 --> 00:50:19,610
A will written when someone has cognitive impairment can be annulled.

647
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:23,109
I'll file a suit to claim the return of my elective share of the estate.  (TN: Under Korean law, a child and spouse of the decedent get a guaranteed minimum share) 

648
00:50:23,109 --> 00:50:27,091
Then you'll be able to retrieve the shares in the holding company.

649
00:50:27,091 --> 00:50:28,990
- Father. 
 - At this rate,

650
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:34,019
you'll never beat your uncles in this war.

651
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,260
Your aunt visited me.

652
00:50:42,673 --> 00:50:47,530
She offered her shares in Soonyang Insurance in return for the department store shares.

653
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:51,410
Your uncles will get the shares your grandma owns under a borrowed name,

654
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:55,909
so your aunt said you'd have no choice but to agree to this deal.

655
00:50:55,909 --> 00:50:59,379
Shares Grandma owns under a borrowed name? What do you mean?

656
00:50:59,379 --> 00:51:04,450
From what I've heard, she owns 17 percent of Soonyang Insurance.

657
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:09,590
We have no other option.

658
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:24,210
I could never dream of such a thing as I was born out of wedlock,

659
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:26,139
but you're different.

660
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:31,880
You are the rightful heir that your grandfather chose.

661
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,879
A fraudulent will must be corrected.

662
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:42,359
My father...

663
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:46,200
Your grandfather worked hard all his life to grow Soonyang.

664
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:49,800
Your uncles and aunt do not have what it takes to run the company.

665
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,700
Why must we let them take it from us again?

666
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:59,790
We must do this to protect your grandfather's honor.

667
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:01,939
Do Jun.

668
00:52:01,939 --> 00:52:05,679
The footage.

669
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:07,879
Let's go public with it.

670
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:36,055
Hello, Mr. Lee. It's me, Do Jun.

671
00:52:38,609 --> 00:52:41,779
About the footage from the hospital room.

672
00:52:42,419 --> 00:52:45,250
Is it still at Soonyang Medical Center?

673
00:52:47,959 --> 00:52:49,559
I see.

674
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:56,359
Then I can do what I want under my authority, right?

675
00:52:58,769 --> 00:53:01,200
Please delete the footage.

676
00:53:03,569 --> 00:53:08,539
Please go ahead and delete all footage from grandfather's hospital room.

677
00:53:11,209 --> 00:53:16,249
Do Jun, did you not understand what I said?

678
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:20,250
You said we should go public

679
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:23,830
with such embarrassing footage to protect Grandfather's honor.

680
00:53:24,459 --> 00:53:26,730
Does that make sense to you?

681
00:53:33,539 --> 00:53:35,300
Father.

682
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:40,709
I always thought you weren't cut out to be part of the Jin family.

683
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:44,750
Turns out, I was wrong.

684
00:53:45,609 --> 00:53:47,979
You will eventually

685
00:53:47,979 --> 00:53:51,149
regret this choice.

686
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:57,060
Hey, don't touch that! My goodness.

687
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:59,660
- Hey. 
 - What is all this?

688
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:02,430
I say this all the time. Be as thorough as possible.

689
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:04,569
- Move it. 
 - Hold on. Why are you...

690
00:54:04,569 --> 00:54:07,769
Stay out of it. You could be charged with obstruction of justice.

691
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:13,610
- You can leave them here. 
 - Yes, Sir.

692
00:54:14,939 --> 00:54:17,310
They were all seized from Sim Gallery.

693
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:20,019
They probably made money by selling forged artworks

694
00:54:20,019 --> 00:54:24,326
and used two sets of ledgers and borrowed-name accounts to create an illegal fund.

695
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:29,090
We must find out where the money came from and how the slush fund was used.

696
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:31,590
Please check everything thoroughly.

697
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,129
   

698
00:54:37,129 --> 00:54:39,369
   

699
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:42,100
   

700
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:58,019
   

701
00:54:58,019 --> 00:55:03,990
Getting the 17 percent from your grandmother will put your uncles at 30 percent,

702
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:06,730
which means they can safely protect their management rights.

703
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,508
This is a fight we can't win.

704
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:13,370
It won't happen,

705
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:18,039
but even if Grandmother decides to give us all her shares, we'll only have 27.

706
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,351
We won't have 30 percent.

707
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:23,220
No. Then we can do this.

708
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:25,410
If you're appointed CEO at the shareholders' meeting,

709
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:28,980
in addition to public corporation and annuity insurances, seven percent of the public enterprises' shares will come to us.

710
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:30,961
   

711
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:32,596
That puts us at 34 percent.

712
00:55:32,596 --> 00:55:35,120
It means we'll safely obtain the management rights.

713
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,940
More so than Vice-chairmen Jin Young Ki and Jin Dong Ki would.

714
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:57,110
If the prosecutors

715
00:55:57,110 --> 00:56:00,319
compare the accounting records on the hard drive

716
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:04,719
with the books that contain the actual transaction records,

717
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:09,920
they will find out who is behind the borrowed-name accounts and the slush fund, ma'am.

718
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:12,069
The carrot or the stick, I don't care what you have to do.

719
00:56:12,069 --> 00:56:14,760
Stop them at once!

720
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,569
Stop the investigation!

721
00:57:33,379 --> 00:57:37,779
Ma'am. Prosecutor Seo, are you all right?

722
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:41,149
Mr. Jin Do Jun sent me.

723
00:58:18,589 --> 00:58:20,619
This is out of line.

724
00:58:21,519 --> 00:58:23,829
Why didn't you tell me?

725
00:58:23,829 --> 00:58:25,890
If I told you,

726
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,980
would you have believed me?

727
00:58:28,999 --> 00:58:33,169
You would've thought a grandson of Soonyang's chairman

728
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,100
was making empty threats

729
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:40,639
to force you to stop investigating the case.

730
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,980
I heard the prosecution conducted a search and seizure of Sim Gallery.

731
00:58:47,419 --> 00:58:50,800
You're after their slush fund in a borrowed-name account?

732
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:55,190
Min Yeong.

733
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,790
That investigation...

734
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:00,830
Can't you just drop it?

735
00:59:02,773 --> 00:59:08,200
You see, those people aren't even afraid to hurt my grandfather or me.

736
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,909
That's why prosecutors exist.

737
00:59:10,909 --> 00:59:13,917
No matter how much money or power they have,

738
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:15,979
there should be some things that they can't do.

739
00:59:15,979 --> 00:59:20,250
You can't always get your way with everything. I should teach them.

740
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:22,620
Why should you be the one teaching them that lesson?

741
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:24,449
What if you end up...

742
00:59:27,589 --> 00:59:30,589
I mean, are you the only prosecutor in the country?

743
00:59:30,589 --> 00:59:33,336
No. There are many prosecutors who are more righteous than I am.

744
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:35,459
So many of them are more competent than I am.

745
00:59:35,459 --> 00:59:40,600
However, none of them can take this fight to the end like I can.

746
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:46,569
Min Yeong.

747
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:53,950
Do you know why I'm after

748
00:59:53,950 --> 00:59:56,619
Sim Gallery's borrowed-name account and slush fund?

749
00:59:59,189 --> 01:00:01,789
I must take it to the end to find out

750
01:00:01,789 --> 01:00:03,720
the person behind your accident...

751
01:00:04,430 --> 01:00:05,930
No.

752
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:11,569
Only then can we find out who instigated the attempted murder through Sim Gallary.

753
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:18,639
I'm doing this because

754
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:22,580
I really don't want you to get hurt ever again.

755
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:30,489
That is why I cannot drop this case.

756
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:05,149
Grandmother, you know Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong

757
01:01:05,149 --> 01:01:08,060
at Seoul Central District Office, right?

758
01:01:09,729 --> 01:01:12,769
I heard she ordered a search and seizure of Sim Gallery.

759
01:01:13,859 --> 01:01:15,660
Were you worried?

760
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:17,269
That everyone would find out

761
01:01:17,269 --> 01:01:19,529
about your slush fund you created through the gallery?

762
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:24,060
Because of the Soonyang Insurance shares you own in a borrowed name?

763
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:28,080
Why?

764
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:31,879
Do you want to claim your shares?

765
01:01:33,149 --> 01:01:35,379
Is that why you're here?

766
01:01:35,379 --> 01:01:37,389
Not a chance.

767
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:40,989
Even if I have to turn all my shares into cash

768
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:44,859
and feed it to the fish in the Han River,

769
01:01:44,859 --> 01:01:49,559
I will not give you anything. Not even a single share.

770
01:01:50,999 --> 01:01:53,000
I know that.

771
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:56,269
From what I know, Prosecutor Seo

772
01:01:56,269 --> 01:01:58,081
isn't interested in your slush fund at all.

773
01:01:58,081 --> 01:02:00,580
Then tell her to follow her interests.

774
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:05,249
But she's investigating the attempted murder.

775
01:02:05,249 --> 01:02:07,979
Someone staged the car accident to kill me and Grandfather.

776
01:02:07,979 --> 01:02:12,050
She said she's investigating that accident at the moment.

777
01:02:12,919 --> 01:02:15,290
You see,

778
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:18,629
if she asks me about that accident,

779
01:02:18,629 --> 01:02:20,830
then you'll have a big problem

780
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,729
because I have such solid evidence.

781
01:02:31,269 --> 01:02:33,270
So, Grandmother...

782
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:41,280
Don't even try to hurt Prosecutor Seo.

783
01:02:42,419 --> 01:02:44,819
For your own sake, that is.

784
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:50,989
The tea is cold.

785
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,910
Ma'am.

786
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:09,040
   

787
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:11,010
This is Sim Gallery's forged artwork sales ledger,

788
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:14,919
which we couldn't find at the gallery.

789
01:03:14,919 --> 01:03:17,689
Sim Gallery sent us this?

790
01:03:17,689 --> 01:03:20,359
Yes. They know they can't avoid punishment.

791
01:03:20,359 --> 01:03:23,400
I'm guessing they're offering a plea deal.

792
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,760
They are hoping for leniency.

793
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,830
All of a sudden?

794
01:03:32,769 --> 01:03:34,939
This is the last one.

795
01:03:53,959 --> 01:03:55,519
   

796
01:03:55,519 --> 01:03:59,830
   

797
01:04:02,859 --> 01:04:04,830
   

798
01:04:06,330 --> 01:04:08,240
She told me.

799
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,940
- My goodness. 
 - I was like, "Why?"

800
01:04:11,709 --> 01:04:12,810
Oh, please.

801
01:04:12,810 --> 01:04:14,150
She did that.

802
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:16,550
Grandmother, someone's calling you.

803
01:04:16,550 --> 01:04:18,749
Okay, thanks.

804
01:04:19,756 --> 01:04:21,780
- Hey, what was that? 
 - Hello?

805
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:23,249
 This is Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong 

806
01:04:23,249 --> 01:04:25,120
 from Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office. 

807
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:26,490
Finish the rest.

808
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:28,489
- Yes, ma'am. 
 - Yes, Ma'am.

809
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:33,410
You purchased a bird and flower painting from Sim Gallery.

810
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:37,529
Y...Yes. What about it?

811
01:04:37,529 --> 01:04:40,839
We have evidence to believe that the money from the transaction

812
01:04:40,839 --> 01:04:44,069
was given to the suspects in an attempted murder case.

813
01:04:44,069 --> 01:04:48,539
We'd like to interview you as a witness.

814
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:16,569
I got a call from the Prosecutors' Office.

815
01:05:16,569 --> 01:05:20,269
Tell me. What should I do?

816
01:05:23,249 --> 01:05:24,910
So?

817
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:28,350
After all,

818
01:05:29,149 --> 01:05:31,720
my shares are what you want?

819
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:05,689
Is it true that you gave the shares to Do Jun?

820
01:06:07,019 --> 01:06:08,490
That doesn't make sense at all!

821
01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:11,930
Not Young Ki or me? You handed them over to Do Jun?

822
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:14,129
Why, all of a sudden?

823
01:06:14,129 --> 01:06:15,760
I knew it.

824
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,242
Do Jun declined my offer to swap shares.

825
01:06:19,242 --> 01:06:22,140
- He got Mom's shares? 
 - Hey!

826
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:25,640
- How could you calculate that in this situation? 
 - Whatever!

827
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:27,240
Mom.

828
01:06:27,879 --> 01:06:29,653
Say something.

829
01:06:29,653 --> 01:06:32,109
Your children are in utter shock right now.

830
01:06:32,109 --> 01:06:34,979
Will you not even say anything?

831
01:06:35,979 --> 01:06:38,350
Mother!

832
01:06:40,890 --> 01:06:42,860
What do you mean?

833
01:06:44,089 --> 01:06:46,359
I know.

834
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:51,700
The reason

835
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:55,360
Grandmother had no choice but to hand over the shares to Do Jun.

836
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:09,719
You know, Grandmother...

837
01:07:11,019 --> 01:07:14,560
I'm sure she didn't want to hand them over to Do Jun.

838
01:07:15,519 --> 01:07:18,899
It was the only way to get the situation sorted out.

839
01:07:18,899 --> 01:07:21,300
So she had to hand over the shares.

840
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:24,769
Remember Grandfather's accident?

841
01:07:24,770 --> 01:07:28,839
You know it wasn't an accident. Someone ordered the hit on him.

842
01:07:28,839 --> 01:07:32,739
- Okay, so? 
 - The person who ordered the hit...

843
01:07:35,779 --> 01:07:38,079
It was Grandmother.

844
01:08:04,039 --> 01:08:05,610
Mother.

845
01:08:06,570 --> 01:08:08,479
Is it true?

846
01:08:09,279 --> 01:08:11,849
Are you going to ask me about Do Jun, too?

847
01:08:12,709 --> 01:08:14,719
I told you

848
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:18,749
that I'd give my shares to a child

849
01:08:18,749 --> 01:08:21,890
who would take good care of the family.

850
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:23,860
Young Ki, you know

851
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:27,459
how I've been treating Yoon Ki all his life.

852
01:08:29,072 --> 01:08:32,800
Is that why you tried

853
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:36,300
to kill Do Jun and Father together?

854
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:38,909
For the sake of the family?

855
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:46,109
Who do you think it was for?

856
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:50,250
For whom did I do such a thing?

857
01:08:50,849 --> 01:08:52,989
Was I supposed to

858
01:08:52,989 --> 01:08:57,489
just stand by and let it happen?

859
01:08:59,369 --> 01:09:02,859
What mother would just stand by and watch

860
01:09:02,859 --> 01:09:04,600
when someone else's child tries to steal

861
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:08,900
what rightfully belongs to her own child?

862
01:09:13,339 --> 01:09:16,309
You, of all people,

863
01:09:17,610 --> 01:09:20,619
must understand.

864
01:09:20,619 --> 01:09:25,490
Young Ki. You, of all people, should understand me.

865
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:30,760
Yes. Now, I understand

866
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:32,929
how you must've felt.

867
01:09:34,137 --> 01:09:38,270
You probably can't forgive Father for wanting Do Jun

868
01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:40,429
to be his successor.

869
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:43,299
I feel the same way.

870
01:09:44,510 --> 01:09:46,440
My son.

871
01:09:47,909 --> 01:09:50,779
Soonyang should have rightfully been my Seong Jun's.

872
01:09:51,409 --> 01:09:54,579
But you handed the company over to Do Jun, Mother.

873
01:09:56,179 --> 01:09:58,550
For that, I cannot forgive you.

874
01:10:36,519 --> 01:10:40,159
It's time to right the wrong.

875
01:10:41,430 --> 01:10:46,430
For the sake of my parents, I believe it is

876
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,510
the right thing to do as their son.

877
01:10:52,510 --> 01:10:56,140
Do you think we'd be able to secure evidence

878
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:58,749
that someone indeed ordered the hit on them?

879
01:10:58,749 --> 01:11:00,450
As for evidence,

880
01:11:01,179 --> 01:11:04,750
I heard my nephew was in possession of it.

881
01:11:05,589 --> 01:11:07,760
My youngest nephew.

882
01:11:08,789 --> 01:11:11,659
Jin Do Jun of Miracle.

883
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:15,959
Mr. Song.

884
01:11:15,959 --> 01:11:17,800
We will summon Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's wife

885
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:20,500
to question her as a suspect in the attempted murder case.

886
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:21,669
Please get ready.

887
01:11:21,669 --> 01:11:23,913
You mean, Soonyang's Chairman Jin?

888
01:11:23,913 --> 01:11:26,749
Yes, we received a tip from a credible source.

889
01:11:26,749 --> 01:11:30,079
We've also tracked down some physical evidence to prove it.

890
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:32,180
Then I'll go ahead and summon her.

891
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:33,809
Okay.

892
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:41,520
   

893
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:47,640
   

894
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:55,930


895
01:11:58,650 --> 01:12:01,560
♫   Never cry  ♫

896
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:06,060
♫   even if I’m walking  ♫

897
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:08,720
♫   in deep darkness . ♫

898
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:14,590
♫  Oh, get me out of here, save me  ♫

899
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:17,010
♫  I am falling   ♫

900
01:12:17,010 --> 01:12:19,130
♫  into a deeper place  ♫

901
01:12:19,130 --> 01:12:24,200
♫  I’m afraid I won’t be able  ♫

902
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:28,510
♫  to return to my rightful place anymore  ♫

903
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:33,240
♫   In the end  ♫

904
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:35,390
♫   I can't breathe,  ♫

905
01:12:35,390 --> 01:12:38,020
♫   no, I can't breathe  ♫

906
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:42,780
♫   In the end  ♫

907
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:47,420
♫  let me live, please let me live  ♫

908
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:50,700
♫   I never forget  ♫

909
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,430
 You'll become even more dishonorable. 

910
01:12:52,430 --> 01:12:54,129
 Because you'd want to keep your position. 

911
01:12:54,129 --> 01:12:55,304
 I know that 

912
01:12:55,304 --> 01:12:58,599
 he is someone who wouldn't hesitate to sell me 

913
01:12:58,599 --> 01:13:00,640
 to buy Soonyang. 

914
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,739
 Would Chairman Jin Yang Cheol have told me 

915
01:13:02,739 --> 01:13:05,140
 to delete the security footage? 

916
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:06,979
 So after all, 

917
01:13:06,979 --> 01:13:09,665
 we're the owners of Soonyang Financial Holding Company. 

918
01:13:09,665 --> 01:13:12,650
 Right, as long as one of us doesn't betray the other. 

919
01:13:12,650 --> 01:13:15,449
 If I want to go independent as Soonyang Financial Group, 

920
01:13:15,449 --> 01:13:18,194
 I need a cash cow that will earn me money 

921
01:13:18,194 --> 01:13:20,119
 until the separation is complete. 

922
01:13:20,119 --> 01:13:21,297
 Soonyang Card. 

923
01:13:21,297 --> 01:13:23,599
 It's time 

924
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:25,029
 we sell Soonyang Card. 

925
01:13:25,029 --> 01:13:26,789
 You bought Soonyang Group's chairman position. 

926
01:13:26,789 --> 01:13:29,659
 You'll be the next chairman and Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's successor. 

927
01:13:29,659 --> 01:13:32,330
 You can't put a price on such a position. 

928
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:37,670
 It's Chairman Jin's legacy he left for you, Do Jun. 

929
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:44,620
♫  In the end, let me live, please let me live  ♫
