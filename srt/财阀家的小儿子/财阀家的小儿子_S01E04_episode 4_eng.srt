1
00:00:01,229 --> 00:00:06,460
So what you want isn't just Hando Steel?

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:11,469
In the end, what you want... is Soonyang.

3
00:00:14,209 --> 00:00:17,680
Do you want to become the owner of Soonyang, Fellow Korean lad?

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,580
   

5
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,750
It may be...

6
00:00:30,659 --> 00:00:34,059
something bigger and something I desire more desperately.

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,160
And that's why... I really need Hando Steel now.

8
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:50,020


9
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,079
It's my present.

10
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:56,579
I prepared it to welcome you back to Korea.

11
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,030
You're one with enormous ambition but not so deep pockets.

12
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,459
This over here is your actual gift.

13
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,169
The doughnut shop from 34 Midway Avenue in New York?

14
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:24,279
When did that franchise open up in Korea?

15
00:01:24,279 --> 00:01:26,709
Soonyang FNC signed a licensing deal.

16
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:29,380
I asked my grandfather a favor.

17
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,249
It was brought in just for you, CEO Oh.

18
00:01:32,249 --> 00:01:34,690
Did you learn it from your grandfather?

19
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:39,920
The fundamental rule of investment.

20
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:42,899
"The fundamental rule of investment"?

21
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:44,830
In order to understand the flow of money,

22
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,600
there is something you must first be aware of.

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,639
The people who have control over it.

24
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:51,639
Understanding the market

25
00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:54,410
is the same thing as understanding the people.

26
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:58,539
Just like you, Fellow Korean lad, who understands me so well.

27
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:17,159
Oh Se Hyeon, was it?

28
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:19,599
Yes, Vice-Chairman.

29
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,329
Look into him.

30
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:26,099
I want to get inside his head

31
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,239
and know whom he meets.

32
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,280
   

33
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,159
   

34
00:02:53,869 --> 00:02:56,069
   

35
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,669
   

36
00:03:12,249 --> 00:03:13,950
Goodness.

37
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,950
That's it.

38
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:22,889
   

39
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:30,969
Our car is leading from the start.

40
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:33,209
The development team was right.

41
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:38,108
The output of the Athene engine that we are launching today exceeds Daeyoung’s.

42
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:41,410
You must be proud, Father.

43
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,650
If it wins the race today, you will have something to talk about at the launch this evening.

44
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,219
We're off to a great start.

45
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:53,030
Father, it's about Hando Steel.

46
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:57,160
Now that Power Shares is involved,

47
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,970
we might need to increase the cost of acquisition.

48
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,339
I'll leave you to handle it.

49
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:09,610
But know that the responsibility is yours, too.

50
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:15,010
Sure. I'll move forward then.

51
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:19,418
It's not just the sports channels and magazines that are here.

52
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:21,220
Even economic journalists are present.

53
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:28,259
- They arranged beforehand to cover the race and the launching event. 
 - Good.

54
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:30,499
The media will eat this up.

55
00:04:30,499 --> 00:04:32,400
It has drama, right?

56
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,700
Father, I wonder what tomorrow's headline will be.

57
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,308
"Soonyang Motors the Worst in Its Field..."

58
00:04:41,309 --> 00:04:45,139
"Comes Back from Behind in Style on the Tracks!"

59
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:48,248
How about this then? "The Black Sheep of the Family,"

60
00:04:48,249 --> 00:04:50,179
"Soonyang Motors."

61
00:04:50,179 --> 00:04:52,619
"The Lower Ranking Speed Fanatics of Soonyang..."

62
00:04:52,619 --> 00:04:56,389
"Once Again Waste Their Time and Money."

63
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:58,360
The money to keep these tracks open,

64
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,360
the racing team operating costs, and sponsoring tournaments.

65
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,259
Clinging onto a business for years that hasn't yielded a profit...

66
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:07,630
isn't like you at all.

67
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:13,270
Hwa Young, you...

68
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,090
Sir, It's chilly outside.

69
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,980
Maybe you should head inside.

70
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,560
Allow me to escort you.

71
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,010
We should go.

72
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:30,689
- What's wrong with her? - Well, it's...

73
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:39,260
Chang Je is your one and only son-in-law.

74
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,600
Even sons-in-law are considered sons,

75
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,639
and you can easily give someone a seat at the National Assembly.

76
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:46,039
How can you not care at all?

77
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,308
Honey, that's enough.

78
00:05:47,309 --> 00:05:51,210
Chang Je... I mean,

79
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,980
does the racing team mean more to you than your daughter?

80
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,608
Not at all! Hwa Young, you are...

81
00:05:57,608 --> 00:06:00,219
my one and only daughter among my sons.

82
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:03,719
Father...

83
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,929
Let it continue to be that way.

84
00:06:08,929 --> 00:06:11,260
Let yourself remain as my only daughter among my sons.

85
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:17,539
Don't get greedy by wanting more.

86
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,050
Are you saying...

87
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,779
that you have no intention...

88
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,250
of helping Chang Je become an assemblyman?

89
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,489
Never?

90
00:06:36,489 --> 00:06:38,590
You are my daughter for sure...

91
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,989
seeing that you understand what I'm saying.

92
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:57,008
Honey, don't be too upset.

93
00:06:57,009 --> 00:06:58,878
Your father still adores you...

94
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,508
as his one and only daughter.

95
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:02,250
It's just me whom he disapproves of.

96
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,850
So what if I'm his only daughter?

97
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,520
Is that supposed to be a compliment? Is that a position?

98
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,660
Don't you know what he means by the word, "Gomyeong*?" 
 (homonym for "only daughter" and "garnish") 

99
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,058
Of course, I do.

100
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:14,388
"Gomyeong" in Korean is the pretty garnish that tops off a fancy dish.

101
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:16,659
What would that imply then?

102
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:18,729
My brothers are the entree.

103
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,668
Since I'm his daughter, I'm the garnish that complements them.

104
00:07:22,668 --> 00:07:24,699
He is giving me a warning.

105
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,410
Gosh, I had no idea.

106
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,779
I wonder if he's aware of how clever you are.

107
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,179
That's what I'll do.

108
00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:38,380
I should let him know.

109
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,350
That his daughter...

110
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,159
isn't the garnish but the entree.

111
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:51,359
Honey, please.

112
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,740
   

113
00:08:45,349 --> 00:08:47,620
It just finished its 24th lap.

114
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,820
It must complete three more for the race to be done.

115
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,530
Isn't now the time for that saying?

116
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,900
"It's not over..."

117
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:03,469
"until it's over."

118
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:14,180
Sir, Chairman Ju Yeong Il of Daeyoung Group is here.

119
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:20,420
Hey, there, Chairman Jin.

120
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,190
I see you came down here early.

121
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:31,259
 Chairman Ju Yeong Il of Daeyoung Group. 

122
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:33,969
 During the Korean War, he defected from North Korea completely broke 

123
00:09:33,969 --> 00:09:38,875
 and founded the group that is now number one in financial circles. 

124
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,669
 The two driving forces behind the development of the Korean economy 

125
00:09:41,669 --> 00:09:43,979
 who rival each other in the financial world. 

126
00:09:43,979 --> 00:09:47,849
 Chairman Jin Yang Cheol and Chairman Ju Yeong Il. 

127
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:55,290
 The two historic legends 

128
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,490
 are right before my very eyes. 

129
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:01,790
Goodness, I couldn't be more ashamed.

130
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,559
My boys should've known better

131
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:07,728
than to drive at full speed while in your backyard.

132
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:10,700
They sped up as if nothing else mattered.

133
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:16,470
Youngsters these days... are just as ill-mannered as their bosses.

134
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,050
I apologize for that.

135
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:24,750
Nonsense. From what I can tell by the look on your face,

136
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,319
my boys have been gracious hosts today.

137
00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:30,219
I heard the news.

138
00:10:30,219 --> 00:10:33,059
Are you going to take over Hando Steel?

139
00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:35,929
You just can't give up on Soonyang Motors.

140
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:37,799
After acquiring Hando Steel,

141
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,670
you hope to grow Soonyang Motors.

142
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:45,540
All so that you could bring me and my group down.

143
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,140
Chairman Ju.

144
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,140
I am not a common thug.

145
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,279
I'm a businessman.

146
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,249
And businessmen should make profits.

147
00:10:53,249 --> 00:10:54,855
Judging by the money you're bleeding,

148
00:10:54,855 --> 00:11:00,989
one could safely call this a rich old man's hobby.

149
00:11:00,989 --> 00:11:03,350
Chairman Ju.

150
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,859
A lot of big rumors come out.

151
00:11:06,859 --> 00:11:11,160
Daeyoung’s cash flow is poor  and you can’t even

152
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,770
give away a business card much less acquire Hando Steel.

153
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,840
Is that true?

154
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,439
Those racing cars.

155
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:24,879
They don't have reverse gear.

156
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,880
Once you get behind the wheel, you can't go in reverse.

157
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,849
And that's what I'm saying.

158
00:11:32,849 --> 00:11:38,719
So you're adamant about challenging us in this field.

159
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:40,319
Here.

160
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,459
My youngest grandson...

161
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:47,459
who enrolled into SNU's law school at the top of his class said this.

162
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,909
"It's not over..."

163
00:11:56,609 --> 00:11:59,109
"until it's over."

164
00:12:03,449 --> 00:12:07,219
That's when you say it, isn't it?

165
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,260
Father.

166
00:12:15,229 --> 00:12:18,599
What a burly young man he is.

167
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:21,729
I almost mistook him for your bodyguard. We should sit.

168
00:12:24,469 --> 00:12:26,098
It could be because of a body defect or the engine overheating,

169
00:12:26,099 --> 00:12:27,338
but the car is leaking gas.

170
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:30,180
It seems as though they must withdraw from the race.

171
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,740
- Withdraw? 
 - Yes.

172
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,609
Darn it.

173
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,750
   

174
00:12:38,979 --> 00:12:41,390
   

175
00:12:46,929 --> 00:12:49,530
 Reduce your speed, and get back to the pit. 

176
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,360
Make a pit stop this instant!

177
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,070
- Right now! 
 - Withdraw?

178
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,276
Withdrawing midway? Are you out of your mind?

179
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,469
Aren't you aware of who's watching the race?

180
00:12:58,469 --> 00:13:00,739
But, Sir, it could lead to...

181
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,139
Keep racing. You'll cross the finish line.

182
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:06,609
 The moment you withdraw, the racing team will be dismantled. 

183
00:13:06,609 --> 00:13:10,280
You won't receive any financial support. Do as you please!

184
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,919
   

185
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:22,630
   

186
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:27,069
   

187
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:34,170
Here's a piece of advice you should consider.

188
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,599
Even with ample time,

189
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:39,839
your cars will never be better than ours.

190
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:43,470
Do you know why?

191
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:46,709
Because at Daeyoung,

192
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:49,479
there are five of me.

193
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:55,019
But no matter how closely I look, at Soonyang,

194
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,660
there is only one of you.

195
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,859
Don't you agree?

196
00:15:05,859 --> 00:15:08,630
That's something to consider.

197
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:12,270
- We're moving out. 
 - Sure, Father.

198
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:17,840
That darn geezer.

199
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:23,050
Father.

200
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:26,579
Please don't worry.

201
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:29,819
I resolved the matter.

202
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,976
You "resolved the matter"?

203
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,170
That's right. The reporters won't put the photos in the paper

204
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,885
and a driving error will be reported...

205
00:15:48,885 --> 00:15:51,209
as the cause.

206
00:15:55,449 --> 00:15:57,950
- Is that so? 
 - Yes.

207
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,289
I'll throw a few bones their way

208
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:02,649
and hand out money to the reporters...

209
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:05,089
You imbecile!

210
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,849
You're pathetic.

211
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,689
Chairman!

212
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,869
- Chairman! 
 - Father.

213
00:16:53,869 --> 00:16:55,709
Father!

214
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,908
Father, Young Ki was only doing damage control

215
00:16:59,909 --> 00:17:01,148
to save your face.

216
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:02,449
That...

217
00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:06,720
That being his best is the issue I have with him.

218
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,450
And to think that he'll take over the company?

219
00:17:15,889 --> 00:17:17,760
Stay back.

220
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:28,240
It seems as though...

221
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,769
he'll be heading to where...

222
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:32,409
the Athene launching event will be held.

223
00:17:40,349 --> 00:17:42,919
- Make sure those are set. 
 - Of course.

224
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:54,599
What do you mean the chairman isn't here?

225
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:55,676
Mr. Yang!

226
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,740
Weren't you scheduled to escort the chairman here?

227
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,869
Well, while outraged, he told me

228
00:18:01,869 --> 00:18:03,509
to go without him.

229
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,809
So?

230
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:09,249
Did you leave the old man at the deserted tracks all by himself?

231
00:18:09,249 --> 00:18:10,749
Would you rather I fire you?

232
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,550
I'm terribly sorry, Sir.

233
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,490
Unbelievable.

234
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,820
- Get going then. 
- Yes, Sir.

235
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,889
Why that little...

236
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,200
The team at the tracks just called.

237
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,699
They looked everywhere,

238
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,800
but the chairman is nowhere to be seen.

239
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,399
Where did he go then when the event is about to begin?

240
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:34,216
He must be gravely upset...

241
00:18:34,216 --> 00:18:37,410
over what happened earlier.

242
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,639
The launching event...

243
00:18:39,639 --> 00:18:42,580
will commence without him.

244
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,050
That won't be wise.

245
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,419
Athene is Grandfather's masterpiece...

246
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:54,329
that will affect the future of Soonyang Motors.

247
00:18:54,329 --> 00:18:57,530
Wouldn't the guests, especially the reporters,

248
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:01,830
find it odd that he's not present at the event?

249
00:19:04,639 --> 00:19:06,599
Put together a press release.

250
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:09,009
Write that due to personal reasons...

251
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,609
Giving a vague excuse

252
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:15,550
will only fuel the imagination of the reporters, Uncle.

253
00:19:16,379 --> 00:19:18,719
They might jump to conclude that the car breaking down

254
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,480
was due to a defect.

255
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,989
And that

256
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:27,290
it started an unexpected disagreement between father and son.

257
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,690
So?

258
00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:33,200
What exactly are you trying to say?

259
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,330
We will have to bring Grandpa here.

260
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:38,940
How, though? We don't even know where he is.

261
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:42,669
Don't tell me that you know.

262
00:19:44,739 --> 00:19:46,610
 I do. 

263
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:50,450
 I know where Chairman Jin currently is. 

264
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:03,229
 To Chairman Jin, who had never known failure, 

265
00:20:03,229 --> 00:20:06,230
 Soonyang Motors brought him a bitter setback. 

266
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,269
 To decompress, he'd go there to remember 

267
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,600
 his original mindset. 

268
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,640
 He never told anyone until he wrote it in his autobiography. 

269
00:20:36,829 --> 00:20:38,959
Gosh, I'm exhausted. Let's get going.

270
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,868
- How about pork braised ribs? 
 - Pork braised ribs?

271
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:43,530
- Sounds good. 
 - Have a good day.

272
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:46,270
- Have a good one. 
 - Take care.

273
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,410
- Let's go for a drink. 
 - What a day.

274
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,549
   

275
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,780
"My Era, My Soonyang."

276
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:06,359
   

277
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:08,329
 Jin Yang Cheol's autobiography 

278
00:21:08,329 --> 00:21:11,499
 was published in the year 2000, 

279
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,598
 while we were all excited about 

280
00:21:14,598 --> 00:21:16,470
 what was to come in the new millennium. 

281
00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:34,680
 And currently, in the year 1996, 

282
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:41,659
 I am the only person in this whole world who knows where he goes to decompress. 

283
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:48,659
 Chairman Jin is at the place that only I know about. 

284
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:55,770
 He's not here. 

285
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:03,808
   

286
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:06,149
 It's Chairman Jin's delivery truck. 

287
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:09,150
 He mentioned it in his autobiography. 

288
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:14,389
 According to the book, this is where he should be. 

289
00:22:14,389 --> 00:22:16,659
 But he was nowhere to be seen. 

290
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,970
Hello?

291
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,309
Yes, Secretary Lee.

292
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:31,909
I'm sorry, Grandpa...

293
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:38,550
Why don't I call you back? Sure.

294
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,920
I'm here to escort you back, Grandpa.

295
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,809
I can't believe it.

296
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:48,119
Is this... Is this so hard to make properly?

297
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,419
That's right.

298
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,899
How did you know?

299
00:24:03,869 --> 00:24:05,369
Sorry?

300
00:24:07,139 --> 00:24:10,170
Not even Section Chief Yang nor Secretary Lee knows about this place.

301
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:13,909
How did you know to look for me here?

302
00:24:15,349 --> 00:24:18,450
 I couldn't tell him that I read it in his autobiography. 

303
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,078
 I also couldn't tell him 

304
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:24,119
 that I never imagined he'd be with an imported high-end luxury car rather than his old delivery truck. 

305
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:27,159
Why? Did you think that since I love high-end cars,

306
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:32,759
I'd be having a moment with those I had collected?

307
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:37,530
Darn imbeciles.

308
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,509
Do Jun, is that what you also think?

309
00:24:42,869 --> 00:24:50,540
That my not giving up on Soonyang Motors is because this rich old man needs a luxurious hobby?

310
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,879
Is that what you think?

311
00:24:53,719 --> 00:24:57,489
Overstraining to acquire Hando Steel in the hopes of making Soonyang Motors better.

312
00:24:57,489 --> 00:25:01,419
Do you also believe that it is a waste of money?

313
00:25:02,629 --> 00:25:04,730
Run along, then.

314
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:08,799
I have two sons who will soon be over fifty.

315
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,328
If they can't even manage

316
00:25:10,329 --> 00:25:12,340
a launching event without me, then...

317
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,399
Well, my life was for nothing.

318
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:44,900
I do not see it as a luxurious hobby.

319
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:50,840
I believe Soonyang Motors is the engine.

320
00:25:52,540 --> 00:26:00,250
It provided the power and energy you needed to make it this far.

321
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,920
The engine?

322
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:06,020
The rice mill in Incheon.

323
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:11,429
Soonyang Motors began with you purchasing two trucks to deliver rice.

324
00:26:11,429 --> 00:26:15,835
With you providing mobility, the rice mill became a grain market,

325
00:26:15,835 --> 00:26:18,870
and you were making deliveries with a dozen trucks.

326
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,639
Soonyang Transportation was born

327
00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:25,680
which led to you showing interest

328
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,349
in petrol, chemicals, and machinery.

329
00:26:29,349 --> 00:26:30,818
With a delivery system in place,

330
00:26:30,819 --> 00:26:35,349
you were able to expand your business nationally to the distribution of consumer goods.

331
00:26:36,649 --> 00:26:39,890
And that is how Soonyang Group was built.

332
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:45,590
Soonyang Transportation was the engine that kept Soonyang Group running.

333
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:52,059
Until you were forced to forfeit the rights over to the military regime after the May 16 coup.

334
00:27:05,879 --> 00:27:11,549
The experience you had back then must be why you're against Uncle Chang Je running for office.

335
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:16,290
Politics should be kept close, but not too close.

336
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,869
That's why...

337
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:30,540
I thought you'd come here to see that old delivery truck.

338
00:27:34,349 --> 00:27:36,009
Why?

339
00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:39,350
For memories' sake?

340
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:47,590
That's what men nearing death do.

341
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,630
You cheeky fool.

342
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:55,570
Was that your way of beating around the bush...

343
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:58,740
to say I'm old and dying?

344
00:28:05,879 --> 00:28:06,910
Grandpa, I meant...

345
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:10,179
I'm late. Shouldn't I give a speech about the new car?

346
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:14,519
- Pardon? 
 - The engine? I like that.

347
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:18,819
From now on, if anyone asks,

348
00:28:18,819 --> 00:28:22,859
can I say what you said?

349
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:25,730
Okay.

350
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,140
Secretary Lee.

351
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,580
I'm returning with the chairman now.

352
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,379
 That's right. 

353
00:28:46,379 --> 00:28:51,519
Soonyang is a late starter when it comes to automobiles.

354
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:55,990
A sturdy heavy machinery company does well with automobiles too.

355
00:28:57,389 --> 00:29:01,299
I admit that as well.

356
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:05,130
But about me, Jin Yang Cheol,

357
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,700
there's one thing those who lecture me...

358
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:12,740
that I should only do what I'm good at don't know.

359
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,709
Automobiles...

360
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:22,590
are no longer heavy machinery.

361
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:26,459
It's electronics. Electronics.

362
00:29:26,459 --> 00:29:31,590
Electronics and semiconductors are what Soonyang does best!

363
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:34,420
Soonyang Motors

364
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:42,430
is Soonyang's engine!

365
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:07,540
   

366
00:30:25,179 --> 00:30:27,580
It doesn't look good, Do Jun.

367
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,320
Hello.

368
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:36,689
The big picture your grandfather has for Soonyang Motors really needs Hando Steel.

369
00:30:36,689 --> 00:30:41,600
How are we to beat Power Shares which has a sack of dollars?

370
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:47,969
If we lose Hando Steel to Power Shares, your grandfather will be furious.

371
00:30:47,969 --> 00:30:50,169
Don't you think?

372
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,010
Wouldn't it be fortunate?

373
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,609
What?

374
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:00,320
You know, Daeyoung.

375
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,819
I thought they'd given up on Hando Steel because of their cash flow problem.

376
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:06,358
You saw it today.

377
00:31:06,358 --> 00:31:10,159
Grandpa with Chairman Ju Yeong Il.

378
00:31:12,629 --> 00:31:15,259
Hando Steel.

379
00:31:15,259 --> 00:31:19,990
Wouldn't it be better to lose it to Power Shares than to Daeyoung?

380
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:51,299
Sir, a report on 4-2's movements.

381
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:54,669
Something unexpected came up in the afternoon and...

382
00:31:54,669 --> 00:31:58,069
I'll call you right back. Bye.

383
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,779
   

384
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:34,120
   

385
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,889
 Daeyoung, Korea's largest company 

386
00:32:42,889 --> 00:32:44,889
 formally expressed its intention to the creditors 

387
00:32:44,889 --> 00:32:47,260
 to take over Hando Steel. 

388
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,558
 There will be a fierce three-way bidding war 

389
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:54,399
 between Soonyang and Power Shares who have already made a bid. 

390
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,798
 Daeyoung Group offered 600 billion won ($600M), 

391
00:32:57,798 --> 00:33:00,670
 which is 100 billion more than Power Shares' offer. 

392
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:03,669
 This makes Daeyoung the likely company to take over. 

393
00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:05,610
Are you watching the news, Fellow Korean lad?

394
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,580
Yes.

395
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:12,349
As I thought, Daeyoung joined the bidding war.

396
00:33:12,349 --> 00:33:15,389
Where did Daeyoung suddenly get so much cash?

397
00:33:15,389 --> 00:33:18,918
Didn't you say just a few days ago they had cash flow problems?

398
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:21,728
They must be betting all they have on taking over Hando Steel.

399
00:33:21,728 --> 00:33:23,889
They got the cash through a consortium.

400
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:25,259
A consortium?

401
00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:28,430
LNK Consortium. It just entered Korea,

402
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:31,298
so they can't confirm who is actually funding Daeyoung.

403
00:33:31,298 --> 00:33:33,300
This is Daeyoung we're talking about!

404
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:37,340
If we ever let Daeyoung take Hando Steel...

405
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,889
Find out.

406
00:33:54,889 --> 00:33:59,330
Consortium or not, who is funding Daeyoung?

407
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:05,430
And why they chose this time, out of all times, to invest.

408
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,139
Yes, Sir.

409
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,648
Aren't you letting your emotions take a bit too much control?

410
00:34:15,648 --> 00:34:17,449
Won't you regret this later on?

411
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:20,950
Oppa, I told you already.

412
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:25,389
I'll show Father who I am.

413
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,389
Do you think anything can beat buying Hando Steel?

414
00:34:33,999 --> 00:34:39,099
Nothing stood out about the consortium that's working with Daeyoung to buy Hando Steel.

415
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:40,600
But...

416
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,870
Vice-Chairman,

417
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:50,479
Soonyang Department Store recently liquidated some of its shares and properties.

418
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:55,779
Soonyang Department Store has such a healthy cash flow, industry experts found it unusual.

419
00:34:55,779 --> 00:34:59,350
- Soonyang Department Store? 
 - Yes.

420
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:01,489
Call them.

421
00:35:01,489 --> 00:35:03,860
Say I'd like to meet CEO Jin Hwa Young.

422
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,799
Yes, Sir.

423
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:12,438
Vice-Chairman, Power Shares contacted Hando's creditors' bank

424
00:35:12,439 --> 00:35:16,950
and increased their bid to 650 billion won  ($650M) .

425
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:25,240
Then how much must we bid in order to win?

426
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,979
It'll have to be at least 700 billion won.

427
00:35:28,979 --> 00:35:33,519
The maximum cash we can put together is 580 billion, Sir.

428
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:37,260
Power Shares increased their bid.

429
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,930
It won't be easy for Soonyang to take over Hando Steel.

430
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:45,330
We can't lose Hando to Power Shares.

431
00:35:47,769 --> 00:35:49,840
Call this guy.

432
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:53,910
Tell him to report to the chairman.

433
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:59,420
   

434
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,519
These photos alone aren't enough

435
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:07,789
to say Do Jun is connected to Power Shares' Oh Se Hyeon.

436
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:11,760
Power Shares?

437
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,830
Where is the company based?

438
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,899
New York, Sir.

439
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:21,070
Where did Do Jun travel with his father recently?

440
00:36:22,339 --> 00:36:24,239
New York, Sir.

441
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:30,950
When two coincidences overlap,

442
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:36,220
is it still a coincidence?

443
00:36:38,019 --> 00:36:39,159
A scholarship?

444
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,765
It's a special scholarship from the law school alumni association.

445
00:36:41,765 --> 00:36:44,590
This year, you're the recipient.

446
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,199
Me? Why?

447
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,329
They say it's from the alumni association,

448
00:36:48,329 --> 00:36:50,869
but it's actually from graduates who work at law firms.

449
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:54,569
Your father works at Seoul District Prosecutors' Office's Special Unit.

450
00:36:54,569 --> 00:36:55,768
Isn't it obvious why?

451
00:36:55,769 --> 00:36:59,410
Sign here. This is the receipt.

452
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,710
Hi, Do Jun. Are you done photocopying?

453
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:05,110
- Yes, Assistant Professor. I'll return it now. 
- Okay.

454
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,049
Thanks. Goodbye.

455
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:09,689
Bye. See you.

456
00:37:20,859 --> 00:37:22,730
Grandpa.

457
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:41,819
I have four children who failed to get in,

458
00:37:41,819 --> 00:37:46,389
but I got to see the inside of Korea's best university thanks to my grandson.

459
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:53,229
Do you go on blind dates or things like that to meet girls?

460
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:56,069
Gosh, no.

461
00:37:56,069 --> 00:37:59,539
I can barely keep up with my lectures.

462
00:38:00,899 --> 00:38:04,410
Okay. Don't fall too hard for anyone.

463
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:10,808
I'm worried you'll be like your father and end up in a useless relationship.

464
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:17,820
Are you still angry with my father?

465
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,419
Do Jun.

466
00:38:22,589 --> 00:38:26,760
Do you know how I got to where I am now?

467
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:38,369
I never forgave those who went against me.

468
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:45,080
Even if that person shares my blood

469
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:50,380
and is a sibling or an offspring.

470
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:03,530
By the way, I got a call from the bank.

471
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:06,639
You withdrew all 24 million dollars.

472
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:08,999
In US dollars.

473
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:13,640
What did you spend it on?

474
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,510
Tell me.

475
00:39:24,249 --> 00:39:26,289
In New York,

476
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:36,659
with my father, I invested in a movie.

477
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:45,110
I thought I had a smart grandson.

478
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,980
I don't.

479
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:55,619
Your parents.

480
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:58,319
They're blessed with a good boy.

481
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,310
Flowers for Suite 3910.

482
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:25,060
   

483
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:28,250
Yes?

484
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:39,930
What are you doing here, Min Yeong?

485
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:44,869
These flowers are for you, Customer.

486
00:40:44,869 --> 00:40:47,140
Where shall I put them?

487
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:04,889
I'm glad we met. There was something I wanted to tell you.

488
00:41:04,889 --> 00:41:08,689
I refused the alumni special scholarship.

489
00:41:08,689 --> 00:41:14,489
I thought you of all people should know.

490
00:41:14,489 --> 00:41:18,930
I don't have exceptionally good grades, and my family is not struggling financially.

491
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:24,909
Accepting a scholarship just because my dad is the director of the Prosecutor's Office Special Unit is a privilege you criticized so harshly.

492
00:41:24,909 --> 00:41:30,638
So are you saying I should admire you for earning your tuition instead of accepting a scholarship?

493
00:41:30,638 --> 00:41:31,919
No.

494
00:41:31,919 --> 00:41:35,689
Don't ever give me another presumptuous advice.

495
00:41:35,689 --> 00:41:42,390
While everyone else is working, you sit in such an expensive suite...

496
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:45,090
to host Rachel's birthday party.

497
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:50,460
A rich heir who does that has no right.

498
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:53,139
Fellow Korean lad.

499
00:41:55,569 --> 00:41:58,869
Do we really have to increase the bid like this?

500
00:42:01,749 --> 00:42:04,749
I'm working part-time, like you.

501
00:42:05,919 --> 00:42:08,880
- It's from Rachel? 
 - Yes.

502
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,089
A flower basket on her boss' birthday?

503
00:42:12,089 --> 00:42:14,089
What do you think?

504
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:19,229
It's a lack of imagination.

505
00:42:19,229 --> 00:42:25,110
Almost as bad as assuming flowers are a man's gift to a woman.

506
00:42:34,939 --> 00:42:36,679
Who was that?

507
00:42:41,919 --> 00:42:43,790
Happy birthday, Sir.

508
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:46,619
This is a coupon for a free meal at our hotel.

509
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:04,569
   

510
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,640
Do you know her?

511
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,910
I have for a long time.

512
00:43:13,979 --> 00:43:16,619
I'm against it. We can't go any higher.

513
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:20,360
Increasing the bid from here is no longer an investment.

514
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,588
What is it then?

515
00:43:21,589 --> 00:43:23,288
It's a gamble, a donation, madness.

516
00:43:23,288 --> 00:43:26,498
Whatever you want to call it, it's something I'd never do.

517
00:43:26,499 --> 00:43:30,630
I take full responsibility. It's my money.

518
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:32,500
This is my career.

519
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,168
I can stake my career on it and tell you;

520
00:43:34,168 --> 00:43:35,639
the company will flop, and if you invest

521
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:38,008
more than 700 billion won, you'll never get your money back.

522
00:43:38,008 --> 00:43:41,510
What should we do then? I must buy this company!

523
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:46,619
If you're going to insist on such a risky investment,

524
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:51,110
 why did you fly me over from New York? Why? 

525
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,689
Because I can't do this myself.

526
00:43:56,689 --> 00:44:02,558
You needed me to shield you so the market doesn't figure out you're Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's grandson?

527
00:44:05,769 --> 00:44:09,270
Do you know who the most dangerous investors are?

528
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:13,339
People born into money who never experienced failure once,

529
00:44:13,339 --> 00:44:18,050
and therefore can never even imagine that they could be wrong.

530
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:21,180
People like you, Golden Spoon.

531
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:26,050
 You're people I can never accept as a partner. 

532
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:28,319
 Please leave this room now. 

533
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,170
Is the owner...

534
00:44:43,509 --> 00:44:46,309
of the chessboard...

535
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:50,309
Do Jun?

536
00:44:57,089 --> 00:44:59,189
CEO Oh Se Hyeon?

537
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:04,430
Soonyang's Chairman Jin Yang Cheol wishes to see you.

538
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,740
This number includes the loan on the real estate.

539
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:17,609
Power Shares' Oh Se Hyeon is here.

540
00:45:17,609 --> 00:45:21,380
It was an unplanned visit, and the secretaries had no idea.

541
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:26,479
Could this be a sign the chairman will get involved in the Hando Steel bid himself?

542
00:45:26,479 --> 00:45:29,650
I guess he couldn't trust our approach.

543
00:45:43,729 --> 00:45:49,600
So I will ask you point blank.

544
00:45:50,939 --> 00:45:56,080
The financier who provided the funds for you to invest with.

545
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:59,920
Is it my grandson Do Jun?

546
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:05,349
If it were about that, you could've asked him yourself.

547
00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:11,659
Aren't you the one person who could tell me about him most honestly?

548
00:46:11,659 --> 00:46:16,130
Because I'm a friend-turned-enemy?

549
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:17,369
You're scary.

550
00:46:17,369 --> 00:46:19,398
My grandfather always took my side, no matter what.

551
00:46:19,398 --> 00:46:21,600
CEO Oh.

552
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:26,610
You're right.

553
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:32,280
Power Shares Korea is run with Do Jun's money.

554
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:39,050
 However, the company he invested in through Power Shares... 

555
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:41,789
isn't Hando Steel.

556
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:47,959
It's a small website where you can buy and sell books.

557
00:46:47,959 --> 00:46:50,830
I don't even remember what it was called.

558
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:52,570
Codabra?

559
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:53,669
Books?

560
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:57,039
Yes, he believes that online distribution channels

561
00:46:57,039 --> 00:46:59,379
will replace all the offline distribution channels one day.

562
00:46:59,379 --> 00:47:04,878
He said Codabra's company value would reach billions of dollars when that day came.

563
00:47:04,878 --> 00:47:06,880
He said it would act as...

564
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,520
Right, as the engine of every industry.

565
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,260
It's absurd, isn't it?

566
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:15,320
That's why we decided to go our separate ways.

567
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:19,388
As you know, boys need their wild dreams and fantasies

568
00:47:19,388 --> 00:47:21,730
to grow into men.

569
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:24,629
But to investors, it's like poison.

570
00:47:24,629 --> 00:47:27,100
Then...

571
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:32,969
What about Power Shares' decision to invest in Hando Steel?

572
00:47:32,969 --> 00:47:36,909
Even those on Wall Street are immensely interested in the Northeast Asian market.

573
00:47:36,909 --> 00:47:42,579
It's one of such approaches and something I want to get done with a sense of duty.

574
00:47:44,489 --> 00:47:50,390
But then again, I do understand why you can't help but suspect your own grandson.

575
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:57,230
The son interfering with the father's long-cherished ambitions.

576
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:01,040
The younger son ruining the eldest son's accomplishments.

577
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:05,010
That's what happens within conglomerate owner families.

578
00:48:06,879 --> 00:48:08,879
Chairman.

579
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:13,120
Speak of the devil.

580
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:22,119
Go on.

581
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:31,060
The one interfering with his father's ambitions and deliberately ruining things for his eldest brother.

582
00:48:33,569 --> 00:48:35,800
Who is it?

583
00:48:40,609 --> 00:48:42,639
I suppose you didn't know.

584
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:47,720
It's a known fact among most foreign investors.

585
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:51,520
The one who started the consortium and funded Daeyoung Group.

586
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,289
It's someone in the Soonyang family.

587
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:05,099
   

588
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:10,969
This is why life is interesting.

589
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:20,579
Who knew I'd get help from the Soonyang family?

590
00:49:20,579 --> 00:49:25,420
But what if Jin Yang Cheol finds out?

591
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,519
Will you be all right?

592
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:32,350
   

593
00:49:33,829 --> 00:49:36,160
 Soonyang Fire Insurance. 

594
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:40,039
It's President Jin Dong Ki.

595
00:50:02,689 --> 00:50:05,530
Let me ask you one thing.

596
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:11,199
Why did you decide to betray your father

597
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:14,169
and help Daeyoung?

598
00:50:14,169 --> 00:50:16,139
The eldest son succeeding.

599
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:17,909
This isn't Joseon Dynasty.

600
00:50:17,909 --> 00:50:18,838
   

601
00:50:18,838 --> 00:50:23,809
Shouldn't the one with proven management abilities succeed the throne?

602
00:50:23,809 --> 00:50:28,090
For the sake of Soonyang, of course.

603
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:41,300
I will tell President Jin Dong Ki to come here at once, Chairman.

604
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:48,570
You should stop Dong Ki before it gets too late.

605
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:51,240
Don't bother.

606
00:51:00,279 --> 00:51:03,180
Let Young Ki figure it out.

607
00:51:04,189 --> 00:51:07,660
Whether he manages to bring me Hando Steel...

608
00:51:08,989 --> 00:51:12,959
or loses everything to his younger brother,

609
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,269
let Young Ki figure it all out.

610
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:25,670
But aren't you angry, Sir?

611
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:26,878
What Dong Ki did...

612
00:51:26,879 --> 00:51:30,150
He's a businessman, after all.

613
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:44,389
If a businessman

614
00:51:46,129 --> 00:51:52,999
puts his parents and siblings before his profits,

615
00:51:55,669 --> 00:51:58,370
he'd never make money.

616
00:52:16,989 --> 00:52:22,360
Hansung Bank said that the most they could do was 20 billion won  ($20M) .

617
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:29,339
So? How much more do we need?

618
00:52:29,339 --> 00:52:36,379
To beat Daeyoung and Power Shares, we must offer at least 700 billion won.

619
00:52:36,379 --> 00:52:38,680
Seven hundred billion won  ($700M) ?

620
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:46,549
Let's offer seven hundred fifty billion won.

621
00:52:46,549 --> 00:52:47,659
We can't do that, Sir.

622
00:52:47,659 --> 00:52:50,628
Six hundred fifty billion would be the most we could do now.

623
00:52:50,628 --> 00:52:52,299
We've maxed our loans...

624
00:52:52,299 --> 00:52:55,159
There are banks and loan sharks.

625
00:52:55,159 --> 00:52:56,499
That's too risky.

626
00:52:56,499 --> 00:52:57,998
The chairman would never...

627
00:52:57,999 --> 00:53:00,700
I call the shots!

628
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:03,169
I, Jin Young Ki, make the decisions.

629
00:53:04,069 --> 00:53:09,240
Even if I must sell all of my Soonyang shares, I'll make sure to...

630
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,580
Why would you sell your shares?

631
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:16,049
For whose sake?

632
00:53:16,049 --> 00:53:19,820
Give us some privacy. My brother and I have some catching up to do.

633
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:47,680
I'll give you 50 billion won  ($50M) .

634
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:53,920
I'll help you acquire Hando Steel.

635
00:53:53,920 --> 00:54:00,060
And you will help Chang Je with his political career.

636
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:02,530
It's a good deal for both of us.

637
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:08,500
   

638
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:12,230
   

639
00:54:13,379 --> 00:54:16,679
 After the long talks and negotiations, Soonyang Group 

640
00:54:16,679 --> 00:54:19,550
 has finally won the bidding war over Hando Steel. 

641
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:22,449
 This acquisition will synergistically benefit Soonyang 

642
00:54:22,449 --> 00:54:25,490
 especially in the heavy equipment and automotive industries. 

643
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:27,260
Congratulations, Chairman.

644
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:31,059
Vice-Chairman Jin Young Ki did it.

645
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:34,359
   

646
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:54,749
Oh, look who's here!

647
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:57,249
The star of the day.

648
00:54:57,249 --> 00:55:00,590
Vice-Chairman Jin Young Ki is here.

649
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,960
What are you doing here?

650
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,259
Let's go inside. We should celebrate.

651
00:55:07,259 --> 00:55:09,399
- Dong Ki. 
 - Yes?

652
00:55:09,399 --> 00:55:10,369
Thanks.

653
00:55:10,369 --> 00:55:12,969
Come on. Don't mention it.

654
00:55:12,969 --> 00:55:19,569
Thanks to you, I bought Hando Steel...

655
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:23,309
at a very expensive price.

656
00:55:24,609 --> 00:55:28,019
Why? Are you surprised?

657
00:55:28,019 --> 00:55:30,789
That I know?

658
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:32,196
Young Ki, it's...

659
00:55:32,196 --> 00:55:33,390
You fool.

660
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:39,659
If you're already this surprised, how am I to tell you that Father knows, too?

661
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:50,340
The employees are thrilled.

662
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:56,110
Father, we should consider absorbing all of Hando Steel's employee

663
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:58,550
in a positive light.

664
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:03,920
I commend Young Ki for thinking this way.

665
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:06,919
Don't you agree?

666
00:56:06,919 --> 00:56:08,959
That's going to cost us.

667
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:13,060
When you win a war, you must take your war trophies first.

668
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:17,169
I do not need a general who wishes to exhaust his stockpile first.

669
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:22,840
The head of the family's soup has gotten cold.

670
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:25,510
Jeong Rae.

671
00:56:34,879 --> 00:56:38,789
No, not for me.

672
00:56:39,589 --> 00:56:42,260
Give it to this head of the family.

673
00:56:44,289 --> 00:56:47,760
He's been talking nonstop that his soup has gotten cold.

674
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:28,970
So Hando Steel ended up in Vice-chairman Jin Young Ki's hands after all.

675
00:57:31,939 --> 00:57:37,080
Vice-chairman Jin Young Ki is timid and weak.

676
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:41,600
Who knew he'd make such a bold move to acquire Hando Steel?

677
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:50,260
Congratulations.

678
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,059
Cheers!

679
00:57:52,059 --> 00:57:55,500
Everything happened exactly the way you, Fellow Korean lad, wanted it to.

680
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:59,130
What kind of magic did you use, Fellow Korean lad?

681
00:58:02,069 --> 00:58:05,410
You taught me what to do.

682
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:08,109
Me? What? When?

683
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:11,209
The fundamental rule of investment.

684
00:58:11,209 --> 00:58:16,949
Understanding the market means that you understand people.

685
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:27,000
I simply did exactly what you told me to do.

686
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:31,000
 Hello, I'm Ha In Seok from the Secretary's Office. 

687
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,630
 Chairman sent me. 

688
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:36,799
   

689
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:40,890
 I knew that Ha In Seok was Jin Dong Ki's man. 

690
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:42,040
   

691
00:58:42,046 --> 00:58:47,679
 Jin Dong Ki set up a trap to get me, and I used it against him. 

692
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:53,718
 If we lose Hando Steel to Power Shares, your grandfather will be furious. 

693
00:58:53,718 --> 00:58:56,489
 Hando Steel. 

694
00:58:56,489 --> 00:59:01,099
 Wouldn't it be better to lose it to Power Shares than to Daeyoung? 

695
00:59:02,399 --> 00:59:08,300
Those who are blinded by greed can't differentiate between prey and bait.

696
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:12,139
 As I thought, Daeyoung joined the bidding war. 

697
00:59:12,139 --> 00:59:18,140
 Who knew I'd get help from the Soonyang family? 

698
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:21,220
Oh, and...

699
00:59:25,189 --> 00:59:28,559
I'm not sure if it was a coincidence or fate,

700
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:32,390
but the universe sent me help.

701
00:59:34,729 --> 00:59:37,130
   

702
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:38,128
   

703
00:59:38,129 --> 00:59:39,946
 There's a bug in the flower basket. 

704
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:43,670
 You're someone I can never accept as a partner. 

705
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:46,039
 Please leave this room now. 

706
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:08,129
 The one interfering with his father's ambitions... 

707
01:00:08,129 --> 01:00:11,829
 and deliberately ruining things for his eldest brother. 

708
01:00:14,339 --> 01:00:15,339
 Who is it? 

709
01:00:15,339 --> 01:00:17,040
 Soonyang Fire Insurance. 

710
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,969
 It's President Jin Dong Ki. 

711
01:00:18,969 --> 01:00:22,680
 So? How much more do we need? 

712
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:26,250
 Let's offer 750 billion won. 

713
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:29,180
 I call the shots! 

714
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:30,488
 I, Jin Young Ki, make the decisions. 

715
01:00:30,488 --> 01:00:34,460
In other words, you used Jin Dong Ki's greed

716
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:37,790
to provoke Jin Young Ki's insecurities?

717
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:42,259
Because understanding people is the fundamental rule in investing.

718
01:00:42,259 --> 01:00:46,469
So you didn't lose Hando Steel to Soonyang.

719
01:00:46,469 --> 01:00:50,009
Rather, you made them end up with a debt of 750 billion won

720
01:00:50,009 --> 01:00:53,910
by increasing the value of Hando Steel.

721
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:55,680
Right?

722
01:01:03,819 --> 01:01:08,790
And talk about perfect timing.

723
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:12,289
Here's a congratulatory gift for you.

724
01:01:13,330 --> 01:01:15,906
You were adamant about this even though I had advised you against it.

725
01:01:15,906 --> 01:01:18,999
Codabra, the online bookstore.

726
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:22,639
It's now listed on the Nasdaq.

727
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:24,970
   

728
01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:28,180
Oh, they've changed the company name.

729
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:33,080
The initial public offering was priced at 18 dollars per share.

730
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:36,920
It's nuts. It's gone up 900 percent.

731
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:39,550
A 900-percent gain!

732
01:01:40,419 --> 01:01:45,330
Fellow Korean lad, can you even imagine how much you've earned?

733
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:48,430
In US dollars, at that.

734
01:01:48,430 --> 01:01:49,599
Now, tell me.

735
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:53,630
Can you now have what you want?

736
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:57,910
The thing that's bigger and you desire more desperately than Soonyang.

737
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:03,010
Probably?

738
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:09,820


739
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:13,048
 Omyeong Group, the eighth biggest company in Korea, has gone bankrupt. 

740
01:02:13,048 --> 01:02:17,759
 Sammin Foods, Korea's oldest and number one bread manufacturer, 

741
01:02:17,759 --> 01:02:20,059
 has filed for court receivership due to financial difficulties. 

742
01:02:20,059 --> 01:02:23,299
 After the company's financial struggles, 

743
01:02:23,299 --> 01:02:25,429
 Jindo Soju finally decided to seek help from financial institutions. 

744
01:02:25,429 --> 01:02:27,568
 The company filed for bankruptcy due to financial problems. 

745
01:02:27,568 --> 01:02:30,610
 - The company has gone bankrupt. 
 - The company has gone bankrupt. 

746
01:02:30,610 --> 01:02:32,438
 The government has reached out 

747
01:02:32,438 --> 01:02:35,556
 to the International Monetary Fund for a 20 billion-dollar aid package. 

748
01:02:35,556 --> 01:02:38,679
 Yesterday's excitement of standing on par 

749
01:02:38,679 --> 01:02:40,179
 with rich countries 

750
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:43,678
 has turned into a disappointment overnight as we are drowning in debt. 

751
01:02:43,678 --> 01:02:47,720
 My fellow citizens, I am truly sorry. 

752
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:50,759
 President Kim promised that the government 

753
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:54,660
 would do everything it takes to turn the economy around. 

754
01:02:55,629 --> 01:02:57,870
 This is only the beginning. 

755
01:03:00,339 --> 01:03:02,669
 Your crisis. 

756
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:11,030
 My... opportunity. 

757
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:12,270
♫  Come on, wake up,  ♫

758
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:13,600
   

759
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:16,290
♫  Bring your destiny  ♫

760
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:21,430
♫  Boy can't you see, deny your gravity  ♫

761
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:26,410
♫  I'm flying, throwing off the fetters  ♫

762
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:31,740
♫  Boy can't you see, deny your gravity  ♫

763
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:37,840

764
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:42,790
♫  I can't walk alone  ♫

765
01:03:42,790 --> 01:03:46,010
♫  Go and stay with you.  ♫

766
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:46,749
 Mom! 

767
01:03:46,749 --> 01:03:49,649
 I believed this lifetime was an opportunity. 

768
01:03:49,649 --> 01:03:52,790
 The foreign exchange crisis. You knew about it, didn't you? 

769
01:03:52,790 --> 01:03:54,489
 He acts smart, but he's foolish. 

770
01:03:54,489 --> 01:03:56,729
 He plays the money game but knows nothing about business. 

771
01:03:56,729 --> 01:03:58,630
 Mr. Jin Seong Jun? 

772
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:00,030
 My name is Mo Hyeon Min. 

773
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:02,458
 You've done well finishing up the studies. 

774
01:04:02,458 --> 01:04:03,568
 My eldest grandson. 

775
01:04:03,569 --> 01:04:06,599
 I'm glad that you have no interest in running the company. 

776
01:04:06,599 --> 01:04:08,869
 You still haven't given up? 

777
01:04:08,869 --> 01:04:10,369
 Do you want to buy Ahjin Motors? 

778
01:04:10,369 --> 01:04:12,969
 With all the debts? 

779
01:04:12,969 --> 01:04:15,738
 Ahjin Motors. Soonyang will buy the company. 

780
01:04:15,738 --> 01:04:17,656
 The president got involved with Ahjin Motors? 

781
01:04:17,656 --> 01:04:19,949
 It looks like the President gave his approval. 

782
01:04:19,949 --> 01:04:23,420
 Isn't that a big deal? 

783
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:24,390
 A big deal. 

784
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:26,940
♫  Throwing off the fetters  ♫

785
