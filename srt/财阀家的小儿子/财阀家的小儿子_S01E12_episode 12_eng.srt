1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:04,561
What? The chairman did? 
    

2
00:00:06,161 --> 00:00:09,001
Okay, I'll be there soon.

3
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:12,271
Did something happen to my husband?

4
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:13,941
No, Ma'am.

5
00:00:13,941 --> 00:00:18,310
Another chairman in the VIP ward is urgently looking for me.

6
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,210
Excuse me.

7
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:25,556
Isn't Director Jung behaving strangely?

8
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:28,490
I think

9
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,993
your father is awake, that's why.

10
00:00:33,831 --> 00:00:37,460
Mother, why are you saying that?

11
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,200
You're scaring me.

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,930
If he actually did,

13
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,801
Director Jung would tell us first thing.

14
00:00:44,801 --> 00:00:48,110
Everyone is waiting for that news.

15
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,440
My gut feeling is definitely right.

16
00:00:52,781 --> 00:00:54,910
It's delirium.

17
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,957
Your brain function deteriorates,

18
00:00:56,957 --> 00:01:00,127
which is accompanied by a decline of attention and cognition,

19
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:03,056
delusion, and movement disorder.

20
00:01:03,964 --> 00:01:06,203
Is this the aftermath of the accident?

21
00:01:06,203 --> 00:01:09,925
He didn't have any issues even when he was admitted, so why suddenly...

22
00:01:09,925 --> 00:01:14,294
The most critical thing for his brain arteriovenous malformation is

23
00:01:14,294 --> 00:01:16,335
physical and external shock.

24
00:01:16,335 --> 00:01:18,034
Due to the accident,

25
00:01:18,034 --> 00:01:21,874
a small amount of bleeding occurred in his head today.

26
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:26,014
He is showing symptoms of delirium because of that.

27
00:01:26,014 --> 00:01:30,685
Can you treat him?

28
00:01:30,714 --> 00:01:32,415
I can't be certain.

29
00:01:32,415 --> 00:01:37,124
The most important thing for treating delirium is getting rid of the illness that causes it.

30
00:01:37,124 --> 00:01:41,325
But for him, his brain arteriovenous malformation is placed deep inside the frontal lobe,

31
00:01:41,325 --> 00:01:43,865
and in his current state where the blood vessel is swollen,

32
00:01:43,865 --> 00:01:47,534
it's already a miracle that the vessel did not burst.

33
00:01:47,534 --> 00:01:49,604
Director Jung, hold on.

34
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:53,255
What about using injections or medication?

35
00:01:53,255 --> 00:01:55,604
I mean...

36
00:01:55,604 --> 00:01:59,674
Is there absolutely no method to lessen the symptoms of delirium?

37
00:01:59,674 --> 00:02:02,815
Stimulants used to make people snap out of delirium

38
00:02:02,815 --> 00:02:05,515
normally increase your blood pressure or heart rate,

39
00:02:05,515 --> 00:02:09,255
so it might be critical for patients like Chairman Jin

40
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:12,354
who has a high risk of a brain hemorrhage.

41
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:18,965
Can he attend

42
00:02:18,965 --> 00:02:21,804
the board meeting tomorrow?

43
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:29,970


44
00:02:30,844 --> 00:02:33,714
Why do you look like you saw a ghost?

45
00:02:36,585 --> 00:02:38,685
It's almost nine.

46
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:43,084
It'll be terrible if we get stuck in a traffic jam during rush hour.

47
00:02:45,325 --> 00:02:49,195
Do Jun, what are you doing? Get ready.

48
00:02:52,535 --> 00:02:54,765
Gosh, Chairman Jin.

49
00:02:54,765 --> 00:02:59,235
Why don't you take a rest today?

50
00:03:00,575 --> 00:03:02,544
Are you saying that

51
00:03:02,544 --> 00:03:06,445
not knowing what today's board meeting means to me?

52
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:10,515
I'll attend the board meeting alone, Grandfather.

53
00:03:10,515 --> 00:03:12,295
Just rest at the hospital.

54
00:03:12,295 --> 00:03:14,634
I'm not a patient.

55
00:03:14,634 --> 00:03:18,295
The members of the board only listen to me.

56
00:03:18,295 --> 00:03:21,695
I'll get the financial holding company setup approved

57
00:03:21,695 --> 00:03:25,894
and recommend you as the CEO candidate.

58
00:03:35,445 --> 00:03:37,315
- Grandfather. 
 - Let's go.

59
00:03:37,315 --> 00:03:38,915
Sir.

60
00:03:39,585 --> 00:03:42,784
- Sir, please. 
 - What?

61
00:03:49,154 --> 00:03:51,555
Are you going to a board meeting

62
00:03:52,995 --> 00:03:55,025
at nine o'clock at night?

63
00:04:05,104 --> 00:04:07,105
Dressed like that?

64
00:04:37,274 --> 00:04:38,935
Grandfather.

65
00:04:41,245 --> 00:04:44,645
It's just a light aftermath of the accident.

66
00:04:46,015 --> 00:04:48,444
Don't worry about anything and take a rest.

67
00:04:48,444 --> 00:04:51,354
You'll get better soon enough.

68
00:04:54,185 --> 00:04:56,124
I'm going.

69
00:04:59,294 --> 00:05:01,295
I have to go.

70
00:05:04,435 --> 00:05:06,395
Bring me medicine.

71
00:05:08,034 --> 00:05:11,534
If medicine will cure me, I'll take medication.

72
00:05:12,335 --> 00:05:14,705
If cutting open my head will cure me,

73
00:05:14,705 --> 00:05:16,974
- I'll cut my head open, then go! 
 - Chairman!

74
00:05:16,974 --> 00:05:20,185
Mr. Lee, call Director Jung in quickly.

75
00:05:20,185 --> 00:05:21,945
Oh, dear.

76
00:05:24,015 --> 00:05:28,524
What are you doing? Go call Director Jung in quickly!

77
00:05:28,524 --> 00:05:30,794
You jerk!

78
00:05:30,794 --> 00:05:35,424
Tell Director Jung to come in. Tell Director Jung to come in!

79
00:05:35,424 --> 00:05:37,864
Do Jun, there's no way you can do it.

80
00:05:37,864 --> 00:05:42,435
The board members only listen to me, Jin Yang Cheol!

81
00:05:44,435 --> 00:05:47,705
I am Jin Yang Cheol!

82
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,914
Let's go.

83
00:05:59,724 --> 00:06:02,155
I'm going.

84
00:06:02,155 --> 00:06:04,925
- Sir. 
-  Let me go.

85
00:06:04,925 --> 00:06:07,294
- Please, Sir. 
 - Let me go, you punk!

86
00:06:07,294 --> 00:06:09,164
Grandfather!

87
00:06:16,805 --> 00:06:19,735
If your delirium kicks in during the board meeting,

88
00:06:19,735 --> 00:06:23,334
the financial holding company will be the least of your worries.

89
00:06:23,334 --> 00:06:26,135
The management right of Soonyang Corporation, no...

90
00:06:27,614 --> 00:06:30,515
You'll have to step down as the chairman too.

91
00:06:34,555 --> 00:06:38,595
Do you really want that?

92
00:06:50,205 --> 00:06:53,645
   

93
00:06:59,885 --> 00:07:02,484
Please answer me, CEO Oh.

94
00:07:02,484 --> 00:07:04,885
How can we get the board to approve

95
00:07:04,885 --> 00:07:07,685
the founding of the financial holding company without Grandfather's help?

96
00:07:07,685 --> 00:07:09,257
Does that make sense?

97
00:07:09,257 --> 00:07:11,231
That's like going to the World Cup without a striker.

98
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,608
Who will score?

99
00:07:12,608 --> 00:07:16,279
All our training and planning is focused on the striker, and now...

100
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:18,435
Did something happen?

101
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,834
The match hasn't started yet.

102
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:26,604
Majority of fifteen board members is eight votes.

103
00:07:26,604 --> 00:07:29,575
We need to find a new way for me to get their votes...

104
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:32,245
- from now on... 
 - There is none.

105
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,745
Was his name Jin Seong Jun?

106
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,654
The CEO of Soonyang Venture Investment.

107
00:07:36,654 --> 00:07:39,357
He moved aggressively and already secured the majority of negative votes.

108
00:07:39,357 --> 00:07:44,055
Fellow Korean Lad, there is no way you will win the votes by number.

109
00:07:51,195 --> 00:07:55,934
So I can't win the vote, right?

110
00:08:11,754 --> 00:08:16,085
Do you want me to cast a vote for the founding of the financial holding company

111
00:08:16,085 --> 00:08:18,225
during tomorrow's board meeting?

112
00:08:19,155 --> 00:08:20,895
Why should I?

113
00:08:21,695 --> 00:08:24,864
Because Grandfather is watching.

114
00:08:31,504 --> 00:08:34,345
Haven't you thought it was strange?

115
00:08:36,874 --> 00:08:40,115
For other patients in coma in the ICU,

116
00:08:40,115 --> 00:08:43,045
they let the family see them through the glass window

117
00:08:43,045 --> 00:08:46,355
to check whether they're alive or not, at least.

118
00:08:47,555 --> 00:08:51,555
So why was Grandfather not allowed a visit

119
00:08:51,555 --> 00:08:54,794
from anyone, including family members?

120
00:08:57,201 --> 00:08:59,900
Because Grandfather is

121
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,605
not in a coma.

122
00:09:03,705 --> 00:09:05,935
He is healthier

123
00:09:06,805 --> 00:09:10,404
than ever, both his mind and body.

124
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,045
Do you expect me to trust you?

125
00:09:16,045 --> 00:09:19,154
Since the accident until now,

126
00:09:19,154 --> 00:09:21,227
I was by Grandfather's side.

127
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,894
Then why? Why?

128
00:09:23,894 --> 00:09:27,594
Why is he making a mockery of his family with such a ridiculous lie?

129
00:09:27,594 --> 00:09:30,469
Do you know that reason as well, Do Jun?

130
00:09:32,335 --> 00:09:34,835
It wasn't a car accident.

131
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,540
It was an instigated murder attempt.

132
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,615
Someone

133
00:09:54,522 --> 00:09:57,052
faked a car accident

134
00:09:57,762 --> 00:10:01,331
and tried to kill Grandfather and me.

135
00:10:02,662 --> 00:10:06,602
To prevent the founding of Soonyang Financial Holding Company.

136
00:10:11,601 --> 00:10:14,072
Grandfather will attend

137
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,841
tomorrow's board meeting.

138
00:10:18,841 --> 00:10:23,681
He thinks the culprit is among those who try to make the founding of the financial holding company fall through

139
00:10:25,782 --> 00:10:27,551
during

140
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:33,161
tomorrow's board meeting.

141
00:10:46,971 --> 00:10:50,451
Many people must be against it, so why did you come to me?

142
00:10:53,451 --> 00:10:56,782
Because I have a conclusive clue

143
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:58,811
about the instigation of murder.

144
00:10:59,721 --> 00:11:02,052
Are you saying I'm the culprit?

145
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:09,932
I guess I'll find out

146
00:11:09,932 --> 00:11:11,961
at the board meeting tomorrow.

147
00:11:17,772 --> 00:11:20,842
   

148
00:11:20,842 --> 00:11:23,662
   

149
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:31,278
I'm CEO Oh Se Hyeon of Soonyang Investment, the host company of the board meeting.

150
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:34,152
I will conduct the board meeting as the temporary chairperson today.

151
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:37,630
The first agenda is the vote to establish the financial holding company.

152
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,662
And if that agenda passes,

153
00:11:40,662 --> 00:11:44,702
we will continue with the vote for the CEO of the company.

154
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:48,472
The weather is great today, Chairman.

155
00:11:48,472 --> 00:11:51,042
You've always liked

156
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:53,441
sunny days like this.

157
00:11:53,441 --> 00:11:55,642
You should get well soon

158
00:11:55,642 --> 00:11:58,842
and enjoy this weather.

159
00:11:58,842 --> 00:12:00,451
Right, Chairman?

160
00:12:00,451 --> 00:12:03,411
All right. The first agenda.

161
00:12:03,411 --> 00:12:07,751
Let's vote to establish the financial holding company by raising your hands.

162
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:09,091
   

163
00:12:09,091 --> 00:12:13,091
If you are in favor of the agenda, please raise your hands.

164
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:18,002
   

165
00:12:18,002 --> 00:12:19,402
   

166
00:12:19,402 --> 00:12:22,472
   

167
00:12:40,022 --> 00:12:41,691
   

168
00:12:49,014 --> 00:12:51,338
Since the majority is in favor with ten votes,

169
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:55,278
the founding of Soonyang Financial Holding Company is passed.

170
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:01,114
Did you move Seong Jun?

171
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,811
We will have a ten-minute break.

172
00:13:02,811 --> 00:13:04,841
- Then we will vote for the CEO... 
 - How?

173
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:06,981
of the financial holding company.

174
00:13:15,835 --> 00:13:17,830
You passed the agenda
for the financial holding company.

175
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,132
You don't realize what you did, do you?

176
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:25,468
You made it easy for Do Jun to take over Soonyang with your own hands, you hear me?

177
00:13:25,468 --> 00:13:27,471
As the eldest grandson of the family,

178
00:13:27,471 --> 00:13:30,902
I just made the choice that is best for Soonyang's future.

179
00:13:34,742 --> 00:13:38,081
Being a pushover is your family's thing, isn't it?

180
00:13:38,081 --> 00:13:42,582
Sure, Seong Jun. Continue your family's tradition.

181
00:13:43,681 --> 00:13:45,852
Darn it.

182
00:13:49,392 --> 00:13:51,421
I don't understand.

183
00:13:53,221 --> 00:13:54,731
He's not dumb.

184
00:13:54,731 --> 00:13:57,071
Why did he suddenly change his mind?

185
00:13:58,061 --> 00:14:00,471
He must know that whoever becomes the CEO of the financial holding company

186
00:14:00,471 --> 00:14:02,802
will become the official successor of Soonyang internally and externally.

187
00:14:02,802 --> 00:14:06,101
Especially when Father is bedridden like now.

188
00:14:07,172 --> 00:14:08,811
Does Do Jun

189
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,382
have something on him?

190
00:14:12,382 --> 00:14:17,421
Next, the voting for the candidates for the CEO position will commence.

191
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:20,852
These two are the candidates recommended to the board.

192
00:14:20,852 --> 00:14:23,772
   

193
00:14:23,772 --> 00:14:28,099
Managing Director Lee Hang Jae, recommended by the company board.

194
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:35,295
And Director Jin Do Jun of Miracle Investment, recommended by Chairman Jin Yang Cheol.

195
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:42,272
A board meeting? A vote?

196
00:14:42,272 --> 00:14:46,141
After putting up a perfect second fiddle like Mr. Lee?

197
00:14:46,141 --> 00:14:47,811
It's over.

198
00:14:48,552 --> 00:14:53,052
The moment you let the agenda for the founding pass, everything ended.

199
00:14:53,052 --> 00:14:58,122
- If you don't have any more candidates to recommend, vote... 
 - I recommend a candidate.

200
00:14:58,122 --> 00:15:00,300
   

201
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,792
What are you doing?

202
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:07,662
You told me to look out for myself.

203
00:15:08,931 --> 00:15:11,072
May I speak?

204
00:15:11,072 --> 00:15:14,571
Yes, CEO Jin Seong Jun. Go ahead.

205
00:15:18,512 --> 00:15:20,742
   

206
00:15:20,742 --> 00:15:22,452
   

207
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:33,166
Soonyang must become young.

208
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:36,132
Director Jin Do Jun who reformed capitalism

209
00:15:36,132 --> 00:15:39,161
via Buy Miracle Fund, installment fund.

210
00:15:39,931 --> 00:15:43,071
And Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's recommendation.

211
00:15:43,071 --> 00:15:45,702
Yes, I respect that.

212
00:15:46,471 --> 00:15:50,711
If Director Jin Do Jun becomes the CEO of Soonyang Financial Holding Company,

213
00:15:50,711 --> 00:15:53,442
Soonyang will definitely become younger.

214
00:15:53,442 --> 00:15:56,851
Because young CEOs and employees will be employed

215
00:15:56,851 --> 00:16:00,582
for the affiliates of the company to match him.

216
00:16:02,464 --> 00:16:05,263
Is there your place

217
00:16:05,263 --> 00:16:08,191
in that young Soonyang?

218
00:16:15,302 --> 00:16:19,142
Soonyang Financial Holding Company that is taking its first step

219
00:16:19,142 --> 00:16:23,971
needs your experience and wisdom you built from sacrificing your youth.

220
00:16:23,971 --> 00:16:30,452
So I recommend someone that knows the value of your experience and wisdom more than anyone else.

221
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:36,493
I recommend Vice-Chairman Jin Young Ki as the first CEO of Soonyang Financial Holding Company.

222
00:16:54,911 --> 00:17:00,782
The reason he was in favor of founding the financial holding company was for this?

223
00:17:00,782 --> 00:17:03,181
He made all of us play second fiddle

224
00:17:03,181 --> 00:17:06,593
and prepared a feast for his father.

225
00:17:09,651 --> 00:17:15,561
We'll vote for the candidate selection with a show of hands as well.

226
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:33,081
Should we vote for it?

227
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:36,852
What he said...

228
00:17:38,952 --> 00:17:41,592
He'll find out when the board meeting is held.

229
00:17:43,391 --> 00:17:45,061
The person who makes the founding of the holding company fall through,

230
00:17:45,061 --> 00:17:48,392
and drags you down from the CEO position is

231
00:17:49,262 --> 00:17:52,802
the person who instigated the murder?

232
00:17:55,571 --> 00:18:00,102
I agreed to the formation of the holding company, yet I dragged you down from the CEO's position.

233
00:18:01,012 --> 00:18:03,942
Does this make me the culprit or not?

234
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:09,382
I'm worried.

235
00:18:09,382 --> 00:18:13,381
Grandfather better like the board meeting result.

236
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:26,261
By the way, Do Jun.

237
00:18:26,261 --> 00:18:28,631
Can we really call Grandfather

238
00:18:29,331 --> 00:18:32,502
the same Chairman Jin Yang Cheol?

239
00:18:34,611 --> 00:18:37,672
Do you think it's okay

240
00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:43,782
to let him manage Soonyang when his mind is not sound?

241
00:18:57,061 --> 00:19:00,661
Whether it's a car accident or a murder instigation,

242
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,772
I want to make it clear

243
00:19:03,772 --> 00:19:06,671
that my gallery has nothing to do

244
00:19:06,671 --> 00:19:10,471
with this painting's illegal trade, Prosecutor Seo.

245
00:19:11,641 --> 00:19:14,911
It didn't belong to my gallery.

246
00:19:15,752 --> 00:19:17,690
It's too much to call it a statement,

247
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,552
but are you going back on your word?

248
00:19:19,552 --> 00:19:21,421
Last time, you clearly said it belonged to your gallery...

249
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:23,222
It was fake.

250
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:29,892
A replica that copied the bird and flower painting in my gallery.

251
00:19:32,002 --> 00:19:33,706
According to the number of votes,

252
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:37,571
Vice-Chairman Jin Young Ki of Soonyang Corporation, who received nine votes,

253
00:19:37,571 --> 00:19:41,772
and Director Lee Hang Jae, who received three votes,

254
00:19:41,772 --> 00:19:45,042
were selected as the CEO candidates for Soonyang Financial Holding Company.

255
00:19:45,742 --> 00:19:47,812
Chairman Jin Yang Cheol

256
00:19:49,311 --> 00:19:51,381
will be here soon.

257
00:19:52,851 --> 00:19:55,021
- What? 
 - What are you saying, Mr. Lee?

258
00:19:55,021 --> 00:19:57,291
He's in the hospital. How can he come?

259
00:19:57,291 --> 00:20:01,362
Chairman Jin is coming to the board meeting.

260
00:20:01,362 --> 00:20:03,232
Right now.

261
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:47,712
You're supposed to be Korea's opinion leaders.

262
00:20:47,712 --> 00:20:50,851
But don't you read the newspaper or watch the news?

263
00:20:50,851 --> 00:20:55,286
Haven't you heard that I, Jin Yang Cheol, didn't get hurt at all

264
00:20:55,286 --> 00:20:58,022
thanks to Soonyang Motors' outstanding safety technology?

265
00:20:58,022 --> 00:21:01,621
The official press release must've been released.

266
00:21:03,192 --> 00:21:04,892
What?

267
00:21:06,321 --> 00:21:11,632
Does the rumor say the mean old man is in critical condition?

268
00:21:11,632 --> 00:21:14,102
- No, Sir. 
 - No.

269
00:21:19,901 --> 00:21:25,712
I got sick of pretending to be sick, so I decided to come.

270
00:21:27,381 --> 00:21:29,952
CEO Oh, please continue.

271
00:21:29,952 --> 00:21:32,182
Don't mind me.

272
00:21:32,182 --> 00:21:36,922
More than the majority agreed to the establishment of the financial holding company.

273
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:40,962
Then

274
00:21:40,962 --> 00:21:46,761
is it time to vote for the CEO candidates?

275
00:21:49,071 --> 00:21:51,172
Yes, Sir.

276
00:21:51,172 --> 00:21:55,642
I recommended

277
00:21:55,642 --> 00:21:59,342
Jin Do Jun for a candidate.

278
00:22:01,482 --> 00:22:06,021
What do the board members think?

279
00:22:17,091 --> 00:22:19,232
CEO Oh, what are you doing?

280
00:22:19,232 --> 00:22:22,872
Hurry and ask for the board members' opinions.

281
00:22:24,641 --> 00:22:27,342
I'll proceed.

282
00:22:27,342 --> 00:22:30,471
For Soonyang Financial Holding Company's CEO candidate,

283
00:22:30,471 --> 00:22:34,382
if you think Director Jin Do Jun is appropriate for that position,

284
00:22:34,382 --> 00:22:36,312
please raise your hand.

285
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,302
Director Jung, what's going on?

286
00:23:30,302 --> 00:23:32,942
You said my husband was in the ICU,

287
00:23:32,942 --> 00:23:35,242
but apparently, he's at the board meeting right now.

288
00:23:35,242 --> 00:23:36,649
Is that true?

289
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:38,741
Well...

290
00:23:38,741 --> 00:23:43,381
You should've told me first if Chairman Jin woke up.

291
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:46,851
You made me come all the way here and check it personally?

292
00:23:46,851 --> 00:23:50,052
You know how worried I was!

293
00:23:50,052 --> 00:23:51,491
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

294
00:23:51,491 --> 00:23:55,762
Chairman Jin insisted he'd tell his family himself.

295
00:23:55,762 --> 00:24:00,036
You couldn't even wear an old man down when you're a hospital director?

296
00:24:00,036 --> 00:24:02,131
Only if I'd known.

297
00:24:02,131 --> 00:24:05,371
A board meeting on a cold day like this?

298
00:24:05,371 --> 00:24:08,494
That is impossible.

299
00:24:08,494 --> 00:24:11,212
From now on, give me a call first

300
00:24:11,212 --> 00:24:15,282
regarding his condition, not his secretary.

301
00:24:21,921 --> 00:24:27,092
I'm warning you.

302
00:24:35,502 --> 00:24:37,371
 Director Jung. 

303
00:24:38,571 --> 00:24:41,101
 Can you give me 

304
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:46,611
 two hours? 

305
00:24:51,321 --> 00:24:54,722
 I'm not asking you to save me. 

306
00:24:56,651 --> 00:24:59,821
 I'm not asking you to fix my brain. 

307
00:25:04,702 --> 00:25:06,761
 Two hours. 

308
00:25:08,601 --> 00:25:11,472
 Just for two hours, 

309
00:25:12,171 --> 00:25:14,142
 let me live 

310
00:25:15,012 --> 00:25:19,211
 as myself, as Jin Yang Cheol. 

311
00:25:19,211 --> 00:25:21,252
 There is a medication 

312
00:25:21,252 --> 00:25:25,121
 to keep you awake 

313
00:25:25,121 --> 00:25:27,952
 and prevent signs of delirium. 

314
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,921
 - Is that so? 
 - But... 

315
00:25:31,921 --> 00:25:35,831
 for patients with cerebrovascular diseases like you, 

316
00:25:35,831 --> 00:25:39,202
 it can be life-threatening. 

317
00:25:39,202 --> 00:25:43,601
 Would you still exchange it 

318
00:25:43,601 --> 00:25:46,272
 with those two hours? 

319
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:05,492
You must've gone through a lot to fill in for me while I was gone.

320
00:26:05,492 --> 00:26:08,632
I only did what I had to, sir.

321
00:26:08,632 --> 00:26:12,462
Now, you can relax get some rest.

322
00:26:13,561 --> 00:26:17,831
Your father is back.

323
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,949
The day you returned,

324
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:26,986
the agenda for the establishment of the holding company also passed.

325
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:29,254
We have two occasions to celebrate.

326
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,924
Is that what the youths these days say?

327
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:35,052
Calling an obvious matter a celebration?

328
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:37,321
Oh, Father.

329
00:26:38,022 --> 00:26:40,861
I was really worried about you, Father.

330
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:45,032
I thought something had happened to you.

331
00:26:45,032 --> 00:26:46,732
It's okay.

332
00:26:46,732 --> 00:26:49,432
How are you feeling?

333
00:26:49,432 --> 00:26:51,942
As good as new.

334
00:26:56,071 --> 00:26:58,750
I've returned to Soonyang Venture Investment.

335
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:02,087
I will not let you down.

336
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:04,351
It's not a small company.

337
00:27:04,351 --> 00:27:07,851
It could change the market flow.

338
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:12,221
My dear boy.

339
00:27:13,391 --> 00:27:17,591
Make a storm.

340
00:27:19,831 --> 00:27:22,107
Like you, who established Soonyang Corporation

341
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:25,544
with an aggressive overseas investment during the second oil crisis?

342
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:26,871
Did you see that?

343
00:27:26,871 --> 00:27:30,449
He's my eldest grandson. Yes.

344
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:31,982
- Grandfather. 
 - Yes?

345
00:27:31,982 --> 00:27:35,481
When did the second oil crisis occur exactly?

346
00:27:35,481 --> 00:27:39,122
I always get it mixed up with the first oil crisis.

347
00:27:39,122 --> 00:27:41,392
You'd remember it vividly.

348
00:27:41,392 --> 00:27:45,032
What a curious boy.

349
00:27:45,032 --> 00:27:47,402
It was 197...

350
00:27:58,002 --> 00:28:01,702
It was 197...

351
00:28:18,391 --> 00:28:22,432
It was 197...

352
00:28:30,331 --> 00:28:32,001
The 70s...

353
00:28:44,381 --> 00:28:47,421
It was 1979, right?

354
00:28:47,421 --> 00:28:50,992
You taught me last time.

355
00:28:55,292 --> 00:28:57,769
Mr. Lee. He seems tired.

356
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,262
I'll take him home.

357
00:28:59,262 --> 00:29:00,972
Yes.

358
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:06,042
Oh, can you organize the luncheon, Father?

359
00:29:07,972 --> 00:29:09,811
Come with me, Grandfather.

360
00:29:32,702 --> 00:29:35,571
Do Jun must be in a rush.

361
00:29:38,772 --> 00:29:40,842
You arrogant boy.

362
00:29:42,641 --> 00:29:46,712
The first oil shock was from 1973 to 1974.

363
00:29:46,712 --> 00:29:50,482
The second oil shock was from 1979 to 1980.

364
00:29:50,482 --> 00:29:52,322
I know that.

365
00:29:53,121 --> 00:29:56,491
I remember it clearly.

366
00:29:56,492 --> 00:29:59,292
How dare you show off when you couldn't even dominate

367
00:29:59,292 --> 00:30:02,432
the board meeting and failed to seize the opportunity?

368
00:30:03,532 --> 00:30:05,861
I dare you to come after me!

369
00:30:05,861 --> 00:30:10,142
I founded Soonyang!

370
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:14,712
I, Jin Yang Cheol, am the owner

371
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:18,341
of the global corporation Soonyang!

372
00:30:59,851 --> 00:31:02,321
Stop it, Grandfather!

373
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:06,331
If you can't trust me, stay healthy for a long time.

374
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:09,792
So you can be the owner of your favorite Soonyang Group

375
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:12,262
for a long, long time!

376
00:31:31,282 --> 00:31:33,352
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

377
00:31:34,452 --> 00:31:38,861
I got my grandfather's temper.

378
00:31:43,631 --> 00:31:45,402
I'll do it.

379
00:31:47,302 --> 00:31:50,172
It's okay.

380
00:32:21,202 --> 00:32:25,942
So when did Father recover?

381
00:32:25,942 --> 00:32:27,871
How can he be so healthy

382
00:32:27,871 --> 00:32:30,511
when he woke up from a coma just this morning?

383
00:32:33,512 --> 00:32:36,881
He was never in a coma.

384
00:32:36,881 --> 00:32:37,789
What?

385
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,581
He thinks the car accident

386
00:32:39,581 --> 00:32:41,960
was an instigated murder.

387
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,630
An instigated murder?

388
00:32:45,492 --> 00:32:47,661
Then he should call the police.

389
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:50,091
Why did he lie?

390
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:53,802
Seong Jun. How did you know?

391
00:32:53,802 --> 00:32:55,932
Do Jun told me.

392
00:32:55,932 --> 00:33:00,241
That Grandfather pretended to be in a coma and waited.

393
00:33:01,341 --> 00:33:03,642
He said that anyone who tries to thwart the establishment of

394
00:33:03,642 --> 00:33:07,082
the holding company, that Do Jun should lead, is the culprit.

395
00:33:14,421 --> 00:33:16,021
Wh-What?

396
00:33:16,852 --> 00:33:18,722
Me?

397
00:33:18,722 --> 00:33:21,621
But... Yes.

398
00:33:21,621 --> 00:33:23,662
It was you

399
00:33:23,662 --> 00:33:26,442
who tried to pull Do Jun down from the CEO position.

400
00:33:31,671 --> 00:33:33,602
Did you do it?

401
00:33:37,242 --> 00:33:39,411
I'm regretting it.

402
00:33:40,941 --> 00:33:42,681
Young Ki.

403
00:33:46,682 --> 00:33:48,222
If

404
00:33:49,722 --> 00:33:54,122
I had the guts to do that,

405
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:57,471
I wouldn't have let Father control my whole life

406
00:33:57,471 --> 00:33:59,910
and come this far.

407
00:34:04,302 --> 00:34:07,401
We're all the same.

408
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:10,372
That's what

409
00:34:11,312 --> 00:34:14,081
the three of us mean

410
00:34:14,081 --> 00:34:16,651
to Father.

411
00:34:17,981 --> 00:34:20,182
All we think about

412
00:34:21,122 --> 00:34:24,091
is stealing his pocket,

413
00:34:24,992 --> 00:34:27,222
and in the end,

414
00:34:28,492 --> 00:34:31,191
we put a knife to his throat.

415
00:34:42,342 --> 00:34:45,312
   

416
00:34:47,582 --> 00:34:51,882
 This bird and flower painting was made before the 1900s. 

417
00:34:58,762 --> 00:35:00,999
 I can definitely feel 

418
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:03,591
 the trace of time from that painting. 

419
00:35:03,591 --> 00:35:06,671
 That's why it's fake. 

420
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:09,131
 I called the professional conservators last year 

421
00:35:09,131 --> 00:35:14,512
 and restored the bird and flower paintings in my gallery. 

422
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:16,581
 Antiques have a lot of replicas. 

423
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:19,242
 More than contemporary arts. 

424
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:22,412
 Because it's hard to distinguish fake from real. 

425
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,582
 That must involve a lot of money. 

426
00:35:24,582 --> 00:35:26,582
 Some galleries probably became famous 

427
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:29,952
 by distributing replicas only. 

428
00:35:29,952 --> 00:35:33,762
 I bet you'd know. 

429
00:35:45,841 --> 00:35:47,941
   

430
00:35:50,341 --> 00:35:52,041
   

431
00:35:53,412 --> 00:35:55,481
Sim Gallery.

432
00:35:57,111 --> 00:35:58,782
   

433
00:36:06,492 --> 00:36:08,591
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes.

434
00:36:08,591 --> 00:36:12,932
I heard this was bought here. Is it true?

435
00:36:15,532 --> 00:36:18,977
To me, all the paintings look alike.

436
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:21,579
You should come back

437
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,782
when my boss is here.

438
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:26,412
Can I meet her now?

439
00:36:26,412 --> 00:36:27,986
What's the matter?

440
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:30,082
I need a gift urgently.

441
00:36:30,082 --> 00:36:33,182
I want to buy a same painting as this.

442
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:36,852
Please.

443
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:43,961
This is her number. You should call her.

444
00:36:43,961 --> 00:36:46,102
Thank you.

445
00:36:47,461 --> 00:36:48,731
What is this called?

446
00:36:48,731 --> 00:36:50,872
- A seal. 
 - A seal?

447
00:36:50,872 --> 00:36:53,341
It can either have your name or a pen name.

448
00:36:53,341 --> 00:36:57,512
Anyway, artists use it to leave a sign that it was drawn by them.

449
00:36:57,512 --> 00:36:59,241
Like this.

450
00:37:00,211 --> 00:37:02,781
I see. I'll contact the CEO.

451
00:37:06,252 --> 00:37:12,892
   

452
00:37:12,892 --> 00:37:16,010
   

453
00:37:56,831 --> 00:38:00,030
   

454
00:38:05,012 --> 00:38:11,140
   

455
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,162
Yes, Mr. Woo?

456
00:38:28,162 --> 00:38:31,702
I found the owner of this memo.

457
00:38:49,052 --> 00:38:51,691
It's me, Chairman Jin.

458
00:39:09,171 --> 00:39:11,772
So it's true.

459
00:39:11,772 --> 00:39:15,111
Our chairman has woken up.

460
00:39:15,111 --> 00:39:18,511
Gosh. Thank you, dear Almighty.

461
00:39:33,702 --> 00:39:38,562
Was it really you?

462
00:39:42,371 --> 00:39:44,241
If so,

463
00:39:47,182 --> 00:39:55,352
were you really trying to have me killed?

464
00:39:59,562 --> 00:40:02,421
Why can't you answer me?

465
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,245
I'm sorry.

466
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,471
I was out of my mind.

467
00:40:16,471 --> 00:40:19,241
I will do everything you tell me to.

468
00:40:19,241 --> 00:40:22,511
So forgive me. Please?

469
00:40:24,211 --> 00:40:26,152
You know, don't you?

470
00:40:26,152 --> 00:40:33,021
All my life, I did my very best for you.

471
00:40:33,021 --> 00:40:41,231
But you were going to hand over Soonyang to Yoon Ki's young son.

472
00:40:42,302 --> 00:40:47,731
The absurdity and unfairness over the years are a part of my misfortunes.

473
00:40:47,731 --> 00:40:50,472
But I will not see my children,

474
00:40:50,472 --> 00:40:55,741
nearing 60, standing behind Yoon Ki and his son like a wall.

475
00:40:58,352 --> 00:41:04,921
It is my fault for giving birth to those foolish kids you are not pleased with.

476
00:41:05,992 --> 00:41:12,121
But please overlook this incident, not for me but for the children.

477
00:41:14,432 --> 00:41:15,932
Chairman Jin.

478
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:25,272
Consider it payment for using me for over 50 years 
as your aid and a nursemaid and raising the kids.

479
00:41:37,521 --> 00:41:39,861
I'm hungry.

480
00:41:42,731 --> 00:41:47,932
Are you trying to starve your husband to death?

481
00:41:49,602 --> 00:41:51,932
Go ahead and check.

482
00:41:51,932 --> 00:41:54,841
There's nothing to eat in the kitchen.

483
00:41:54,841 --> 00:41:58,571
Are you taking care of the house or not?

484
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:04,120
Or are you exerting power over me for giving birth to one son?

485
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,921
Stop sitting there and chatting away.

486
00:42:11,921 --> 00:42:15,191
Go to the market and get me a row of eggs.

487
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:18,531
I want fried eggs.

488
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,961
What do you mean there is someone to control access to your grandfather's room?

489
00:42:42,961 --> 00:42:44,721
Who is it?

490
00:42:44,721 --> 00:42:48,522
I'll tell you after we talk to Grandfather, Father.

491
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:52,971
- Grandmother. 
 - Mother.

492
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:57,571
Your father was throwing a tantrum to move to our house.

493
00:42:57,571 --> 00:42:59,541
He's not even in a coma.

494
00:42:59,541 --> 00:43:02,742
There's no reason to feed him hospital food.

495
00:43:02,742 --> 00:43:05,372
Don't you agree, Do Jun?

496
00:43:05,372 --> 00:43:07,812
Yes, Grandmother.

497
00:43:07,812 --> 00:43:09,711
But Grandmother, the discharge procedure...

498
00:43:09,711 --> 00:43:13,721
They're going to take care of it.

499
00:43:17,791 --> 00:43:21,222
Let's go to Jeongsimjae, Chairman Jin.

500
00:43:21,222 --> 00:43:23,562
Our house.

501
00:43:25,062 --> 00:43:26,962
Grandmother.

502
00:43:31,202 --> 00:43:32,841
Father, please see them off.

503
00:43:32,841 --> 00:43:34,372
Sure.

504
00:43:38,441 --> 00:43:41,282
Doctor, what happened? What is this about the discharge procedure?

505
00:43:41,282 --> 00:43:45,381
Mrs. Lee knew everything when she came.

506
00:43:45,381 --> 00:43:47,852
What's more, living in an environment

507
00:43:47,852 --> 00:43:53,152
Chairman Jin is used to, his house in this case, might help him with his delirium more.

508
00:44:00,662 --> 00:44:03,131
It's almost time for your husbands to come home.

509
00:44:03,131 --> 00:44:05,877
Is setting the table all we have to do now?

510
00:44:05,877 --> 00:44:08,471
Are you that happy Father is back?

511
00:44:08,471 --> 00:44:11,971
You're talking as if you're singing, Mother.

512
00:44:11,971 --> 00:44:16,682
Yes, I'm that happy. Do you want me to sing a song for you?

513
00:44:18,151 --> 00:44:19,721
Let's see.

514
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:25,022
Gosh, why didn't you boil it for longer?

515
00:44:25,022 --> 00:44:30,498
Young Ki likes it when the meat is soft to the point it just slides off the bone.

516
00:44:30,498 --> 00:44:37,037
Because of your deep love for him, he became an overly soft-hearted man.

517
00:44:37,037 --> 00:44:42,272
He's an absolute softie, unable to talk back to Father once.

518
00:44:43,372 --> 00:44:47,382
Why don't you try to raise your husband to your liking?

519
00:44:47,382 --> 00:44:49,911
I doubt you can.

520
00:44:49,911 --> 00:44:53,352
If you can, I'll call you Mother.

521
00:44:54,921 --> 00:44:57,752
- Keep up the good work. 
 - Okay.

522
00:45:00,467 --> 00:45:02,237
Jeong Rae.

523
00:45:02,237 --> 00:45:04,669
Did your husband tell you anything?

524
00:45:04,669 --> 00:45:06,404
About tonight's dinner.

525
00:45:06,404 --> 00:45:09,772
Isn't it to celebrate Father's discharge?

526
00:45:09,772 --> 00:45:11,178
Or is there another reason?

527
00:45:11,178 --> 00:45:15,372
Mother called everyone home except for Do Jun's family.

528
00:45:15,372 --> 00:45:17,312
Isn't it obvious?

529
00:45:22,452 --> 00:45:25,052
I asked the kids to come over.

530
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:29,521
To have dinner with everyone.

531
00:45:52,441 --> 00:45:55,582
It's a relief, isn't it?

532
00:45:55,582 --> 00:45:59,211
Without knowing what a terrible thing

533
00:45:59,952 --> 00:46:03,191
I had done to you for the rest of your life,

534
00:46:03,191 --> 00:46:06,591
you'll live happily and leave this world peacefully.

535
00:46:07,791 --> 00:46:10,532
But even if you had known about it,

536
00:46:11,191 --> 00:46:17,432
nobody in this world would believe your words now.

537
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:26,782
I'm going to tell everyone about it during dinner.

538
00:46:26,782 --> 00:46:29,381
Your condition.

539
00:46:29,381 --> 00:46:35,752
Only then can they fulfill their duties as our kids.

540
00:46:47,461 --> 00:46:51,401
You've finally become my true husband.

541
00:46:53,501 --> 00:46:55,872
My dear chairman.

542
00:47:25,102 --> 00:47:27,002
What about Father?

543
00:47:28,841 --> 00:47:32,372
Where's the star of tonight's discharge celebration party?

544
00:47:34,242 --> 00:47:35,453
Is Father unwell?

545
00:47:35,453 --> 00:47:37,281
Hey, didn't you hear it during the day?

546
00:47:37,281 --> 00:47:39,457
Father called himself a fake patient.

547
00:47:39,457 --> 00:47:42,552
That was why Mother brought him home.

548
00:47:42,552 --> 00:47:44,752
What is it, Mother?

549
00:47:44,752 --> 00:47:48,321
What did you want to tell us about Father's health?

550
00:47:54,662 --> 00:47:59,602
Don't be so shocked.

551
00:48:01,501 --> 00:48:03,712
Your father...

552
00:48:11,082 --> 00:48:14,722
Ma'am, Do Jun is here.

553
00:48:19,392 --> 00:48:21,192
Good evening.

554
00:48:22,361 --> 00:48:24,761
I'm here, Grandmother.

555
00:48:24,761 --> 00:48:27,001
What brings you here?

556
00:48:27,001 --> 00:48:30,931
I don't recall calling you over for dinner.

557
00:48:32,202 --> 00:48:34,371
Here.

558
00:48:36,012 --> 00:48:38,872
I couldn't keep it to myself.

559
00:48:57,231 --> 00:49:00,400
  ,   

560
00:49:14,182 --> 00:49:16,952
What is it, Mother? What does it say?

561
00:49:18,812 --> 00:49:21,222
It's Grandfather's medical report.

562
00:49:21,981 --> 00:49:24,521
I thought Grandmother would need it.

563
00:49:31,405 --> 00:49:35,343
It seems like I shouldn't be here.

564
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:37,471
Grandmother.

565
00:49:38,302 --> 00:49:40,941
I'll be in your studio.

566
00:49:41,671 --> 00:49:43,641
Enjoy your dinner.

567
00:49:49,952 --> 00:49:51,381
What medical report?

568
00:49:51,381 --> 00:49:55,523
Didn't you have something to tell us regarding Father's health before Do Jun came?

569
00:49:55,523 --> 00:49:58,421
Is Father really sick?

570
00:49:58,421 --> 00:50:00,692
Like how?

571
00:50:00,692 --> 00:50:03,762
- Tell us. 
 - Please say something.

572
00:50:03,762 --> 00:50:06,231
Your father...

573
00:50:11,872 --> 00:50:18,942
He's healthy without any after-effects from the car accident.

574
00:50:20,682 --> 00:50:22,452
That's great news.

575
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:25,782
And yet, you didn't call Do Jun's family to dinner?

576
00:50:25,782 --> 00:50:29,152
You have more to say, don't you?

577
00:50:29,152 --> 00:50:32,662
About an important matter within our family or something.

578
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:38,821
In our family, nothing is more important than your father's health.

579
00:50:41,262 --> 00:50:43,972
   

580
00:50:43,972 --> 00:50:47,671
You're right. Our father is healthy.

581
00:50:47,671 --> 00:50:49,372
But isn't this the biggest problem?

582
00:50:49,372 --> 00:50:50,341
How could you say such...

583
00:50:50,341 --> 00:50:55,282
Mother, our father accuses us of being despicable and immoral kids

584
00:50:55,282 --> 00:50:58,651
who would incite a car crash to gain his wealth.

585
00:50:58,651 --> 00:51:01,282
This is the least I can say about him.

586
00:51:01,282 --> 00:51:04,091
Enough. Your nephew and niece are here too.

587
00:51:04,091 --> 00:51:06,994
He should've caught a fatal disease.

588
00:51:07,762 --> 00:51:11,261
I would blame that for his clouded judgment.

589
00:51:11,261 --> 00:51:16,901
Then I wouldn't feel this betrayed.

590
00:51:21,702 --> 00:51:23,571
Please excuse me.

591
00:51:30,751 --> 00:51:32,812
Let's dig in.

592
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:36,251
What is it that you want to say?

593
00:52:36,251 --> 00:52:39,581
What couldn't you keep to yourself?

594
00:52:39,581 --> 00:52:45,625
This white camellia you leave as a seal on your paintings.

595
00:52:45,625 --> 00:52:49,062
I looked into what it meant.

596
00:52:49,832 --> 00:52:52,092
A secret love.

597
00:52:52,092 --> 00:52:55,132
The parent's love towards their child.

598
00:52:57,802 --> 00:53:00,032
Something along those lines.

599
00:53:06,412 --> 00:53:07,510
Oh, right.

600
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:14,080
Are there such feelingins in here too?

601
00:53:25,462 --> 00:53:28,262
   

602
00:53:52,321 --> 00:53:55,609
I will keep your secret, Grandmother.

603
00:53:55,609 --> 00:54:00,649
So you should keep Grandfather's secret, Grandmother.

604
00:54:01,602 --> 00:54:05,171
Nobody who comes and goes Jeongsimjae,

605
00:54:05,171 --> 00:54:08,041
especially our family members,

606
00:54:08,041 --> 00:54:14,772
must know about Grandfather's delirium until the board meeting ends.

607
00:54:14,772 --> 00:54:17,352
How dare you

608
00:54:20,122 --> 00:54:22,881
threaten an old lady like me.

609
00:54:23,597 --> 00:54:26,726
I thought it was a deal, Grandmother.

610
00:54:30,131 --> 00:54:32,392
Threatening you

611
00:54:34,001 --> 00:54:36,202
starts now.

612
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:44,471
If anyone in our family finds out about Grandfather's delirium,

613
00:54:47,312 --> 00:54:51,481
I will not keep your secret anymore.

614
00:54:53,122 --> 00:54:55,802
Everything from the memo abetting the murder

615
00:54:57,291 --> 00:55:00,791
to the counterfeit painting as the price.

616
00:55:03,262 --> 00:55:07,131
I'll submit them to the prosecution as evidence to prove your charges.

617
00:55:11,571 --> 00:55:13,542
It was because of you.

618
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:19,142
If only you hadn't appeared...

619
00:55:21,082 --> 00:55:27,452
If only you hadn't dared desire Soonyang, this would not have happened.

620
00:55:28,852 --> 00:55:33,021
That day. On Grandfather's sixtieth birthday party.

621
00:55:34,791 --> 00:55:38,861
The one who invited my family after years of going without contact

622
00:55:40,532 --> 00:55:43,362
was none other than you, Grandmother.

623
00:55:52,012 --> 00:55:54,772
Do whatever it takes to protect Grandfather.

624
00:55:56,282 --> 00:55:59,352
In doing so, you'll save yourself.

625
00:56:57,447 --> 00:57:00,711
How long have you been standing there?

626
00:57:00,711 --> 00:57:04,881
I got here right before you called me.

627
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:10,421
Medical director Jung was right.

628
00:57:10,421 --> 00:57:15,091
He said you'd feel much better back at Jeongsimjae.

629
00:57:15,091 --> 00:57:18,131
The effect is more positive than I thought.

630
00:57:18,131 --> 00:57:24,262
Even I don't know what's going on inside my own head.

631
00:57:24,262 --> 00:57:27,901
How could Director Jung know?

632
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:33,082
I came to see how you're feeling.

633
00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:37,012
I'll go home now. Get some rest, Grandfather.

634
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:39,951
Do Jun.

635
00:57:39,951 --> 00:57:41,982
Yes, Grandfather?

636
00:57:41,982 --> 00:57:44,721
Why won't you tell me?

637
00:57:47,222 --> 00:57:50,562
Mr. Woo must've reported to you.

638
00:57:52,162 --> 00:57:56,102
Who did he say instigated the accident?

639
00:57:56,972 --> 00:57:58,871
Who is it?

640
00:58:01,302 --> 00:58:04,341
Who tried to kill me?

641
00:58:14,222 --> 00:58:17,151
We're still looking.

642
00:58:18,622 --> 00:58:23,961
The bird and flower painting. It didn't belong to Ms. Mo.

643
00:58:26,602 --> 00:58:30,532
I'll tell you as soon as we find out.

644
00:58:30,532 --> 00:58:32,532
Don't worry.

645
00:58:33,102 --> 00:58:36,301
- You will? 
 - Yes.

646
00:58:39,242 --> 00:58:41,941
Let me ask you one thing.

647
00:58:44,121 --> 00:58:52,382
All my other kids wanted to impress me and try to inherit Soonyang.

648
00:58:54,992 --> 00:58:58,961
Why did you say you'd buy Soonyang?

649
00:59:04,077 --> 00:59:06,877
You want something else, don't you?

650
00:59:10,541 --> 00:59:12,512
What is that?

651
00:59:21,321 --> 00:59:23,491
Tell me.

652
00:59:31,892 --> 00:59:36,410
What? Is it a secret?

653
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:43,571
Did you get what you wanted?

654
00:59:45,441 --> 00:59:48,582
No, not yet.

655
00:59:53,521 --> 00:59:59,022
I hope you achieve it for sure.

656
01:00:09,901 --> 01:00:11,931
I will, Grandfather.

657
01:00:13,202 --> 01:00:15,172
I will.

658
01:00:29,752 --> 01:00:31,522
Hello.

659
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:40,303
How did things go at Sim Gallery?

660
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:42,131
Did you find any leads?

661
01:00:42,131 --> 01:00:45,332
Did you find out who traded the painting?

662
01:00:47,642 --> 01:00:49,701
It must be upsetting.

663
01:00:51,941 --> 01:00:57,282
You asked so many questions, and I only have one answer.

664
01:00:58,312 --> 01:01:00,781
I didn't find anything.

665
01:01:03,727 --> 01:01:09,191
You said you had to see me today, so I thought you'd found something.

666
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:13,401
   

667
01:01:13,401 --> 01:01:16,139
I heard Sim Gallery sells forgeries,

668
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:21,572
so I looked into their accounts to see if money was laundered.

669
01:01:21,572 --> 01:01:26,671
I followed the money flow to some borrowed name accounts and found a name you'd know.

670
01:01:26,671 --> 01:01:28,341
Take a look.

671
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:46,562
Min Yeong.

672
01:01:46,562 --> 01:01:50,932
The accident Grandfather and I were in. We decided to

673
01:01:52,231 --> 01:01:57,842
wrap it up as the police did and call it a random accident.

674
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:02,589
I put you through a great deal.

675
01:02:02,589 --> 01:02:05,182
I won't bother you again.

676
01:02:06,082 --> 01:02:10,521
I asked to see you to say that, even though it was late.

677
01:02:25,771 --> 01:02:31,842
You have an idea what the name is that I found.

678
01:02:31,842 --> 01:02:35,885
You did find a lead at the gallery.

679
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:38,582
You also know who traded that painting.

680
01:02:38,582 --> 01:02:40,952
That's why

681
01:02:40,952 --> 01:02:45,321
you feel uncomfortable that I, that my office is investigating.

682
01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:48,965
The board meeting is over anyway,

683
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:52,432
and you don't doubt you'll be voted as CEO of the holding company

684
01:02:52,432 --> 01:02:54,801
at the shareholder meeting.

685
01:02:56,901 --> 01:03:00,742
Yes. That's it.

686
01:03:08,722 --> 01:03:10,421
Right.

687
01:03:11,881 --> 01:03:14,551
Just when I forget, you remind me.

688
01:03:15,981 --> 01:03:18,881
That decision is true to your identity as an heir.

689
01:03:19,622 --> 01:03:24,492
Now I must make a decision that's true to mine.

690
01:03:29,001 --> 01:03:30,832
Goodbye.

691
01:03:53,921 --> 01:03:56,191
What do you think?

692
01:03:57,861 --> 01:04:02,632
What if the one who planned that dangerous a thing

693
01:04:02,632 --> 01:04:06,302
with a forged painting is a member of your family?

694
01:04:08,401 --> 01:04:11,112
Does anyone come to mind?

695
01:04:11,112 --> 01:04:14,541
Anyone in this family could've done it, and it wouldn't seem strange.

696
01:04:16,142 --> 01:04:19,111
You suspected me, too,

697
01:04:19,111 --> 01:04:22,282
for the attempted murder of my grandfather and Do Jun.

698
01:04:24,122 --> 01:04:27,521
I just got flustered as soon as I saw the painting.

699
01:04:28,521 --> 01:04:31,361
I didn't suspect you.

700
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:35,261
Do you still want to know

701
01:04:35,261 --> 01:04:40,971
whom I gave the real painting from your gallery to?

702
01:04:40,971 --> 01:04:43,601
It doesn't matter.

703
01:04:43,601 --> 01:04:45,841
I trust you.

704
01:04:50,381 --> 01:04:52,682
Would you like some wine?

705
01:05:05,832 --> 01:05:08,262
You've changed a lot.

706
01:05:09,009 --> 01:05:10,809
Life here

707
01:05:19,981 --> 01:05:22,282
must've been rough.

708
01:05:27,597 --> 01:05:30,768
You don't have to try so hard around me.

709
01:05:32,452 --> 01:05:34,362
I told you.

710
01:05:35,262 --> 01:05:37,761
You're bearable

711
01:05:37,761 --> 01:05:44,761
only when you don't care at all what others think.

712
01:05:46,947 --> 01:05:49,487
Don't act like you're clueless.

713
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:52,341
There are many such women out there.

714
01:06:04,352 --> 01:06:06,791
Thanks for recommending wine.

715
01:06:07,691 --> 01:06:10,722
It just doesn't taste as good at home.

716
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:49,362
It's our first ever drink together, isn't it, Father-in-law?

717
01:06:49,362 --> 01:06:53,301
Yes, it is. I should've invited you sooner, Sir.

718
01:06:54,041 --> 01:06:59,742
I married your daughter a while ago, and you still can't relax around me.

719
01:07:00,782 --> 01:07:02,385
I know that

720
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:05,722
you rushed the wedding to gain my grandfather's connections

721
01:07:05,722 --> 01:07:07,690
more than a son-in-law.

722
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,551
Why would you say that?

723
01:07:09,551 --> 01:07:12,691
Did my daughter do anything insulting?

724
01:07:13,463 --> 01:07:15,691
Don't worry about my wife.

725
01:07:15,691 --> 01:07:17,892
She has me.

726
01:07:21,532 --> 01:07:23,270
From now on,

727
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:30,130
I'd like you to be not Chairman Jin's in-law, but my father-in-law.

728
01:07:37,787 --> 01:07:40,322
Are you planning something big enough

729
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:44,322
that you need the power of my newspaper, my son-in-law Seong Jun?

730
01:08:00,842 --> 01:08:02,272
   

731
01:08:02,272 --> 01:08:05,312
   

732
01:08:05,312 --> 01:08:09,670
   

733
01:08:11,351 --> 01:08:12,422
   

734
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:15,921
Isn't Chairman Jin Yang Cheol being too arbitrary?

735
01:08:15,921 --> 01:08:17,560
I'll find a solution.

736
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,152
Please do.

737
01:08:19,152 --> 01:08:22,962
 An astronomical sum of tax money went into Soonyang Motors that's now struggling. 

738
01:08:22,962 --> 01:08:28,531
We assemblymen from all major parties demand they be held responsible.

739
01:08:28,531 --> 01:08:33,239
Taxpayers' money shouldn't be used to provide the rich with an easy way out.

740
01:08:33,239 --> 01:08:37,671
It's money that ordinary people shed blood and sweat to earn.

741
01:08:37,671 --> 01:08:42,682
We demand Jin Yang Cheol agree to a hearing.

742
01:08:44,581 --> 01:08:47,730
   

743
01:08:52,381 --> 01:08:59,736
Will the shareholders organize a vote of non-confidence against me?

744
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:08,310
Soonyang Motors' share price has fallen a lot.

745
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:11,848
The shareholders equate the share price with you.

746
01:09:11,848 --> 01:09:14,241
People can forgive someone who killed their father,

747
01:09:14,241 --> 01:09:18,451
but they can't forgive someone who squandered their money.

748
01:09:18,451 --> 01:09:20,222
Father, what I mean is,

749
01:09:20,222 --> 01:09:24,082
that's how people think these days.

750
01:09:24,082 --> 01:09:27,392
Here's what I heard people think.

751
01:09:28,322 --> 01:09:31,331
It's not the shareholders.

752
01:09:32,392 --> 01:09:36,602
They named it the Rebellion of the Jin Prince.

753
01:09:41,272 --> 01:09:43,202
Is that true?

754
01:09:44,512 --> 01:09:46,941
People can be so silly.

755
01:09:47,982 --> 01:09:51,352
We're no longer ruled by a monarchy.

756
01:09:52,055 --> 01:09:56,121
In this age of capitalism, if we can't protect our shareholders,

757
01:09:56,121 --> 01:10:00,051
then of course we'll lose management rights.

758
01:10:00,051 --> 01:10:04,332
You always talked about the global standard.

759
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:11,532
Politicians are going crazy, demanding you agree to a hearing.

760
01:10:11,532 --> 01:10:15,142
They're jabbing fingers in the air and yelling.

761
01:10:15,142 --> 01:10:18,142
It paints a pretty pre-election picture.

762
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:22,512
Let's try to weather the storm for now.

763
01:10:22,512 --> 01:10:27,087
You can point and yell at the sky because there's thunder and lightning,

764
01:10:27,087 --> 01:10:29,582
but you'll only get wet.

765
01:10:30,322 --> 01:10:31,892
Right?

766
01:10:35,192 --> 01:10:37,122
Half and half.

767
01:10:37,122 --> 01:10:40,201
The market's view of the likelihood the Prince's Rebellion will work.

768
01:10:40,201 --> 01:10:44,472
However charismatic Jin Yang Cheol may be, it won't be easy this time.

769
01:10:44,472 --> 01:10:47,542
Soonyang Motors owes four trillion won  ($4B) .

770
01:10:47,542 --> 01:10:53,211
Soonyang Empire's princes didn't target Soonyang Motors because of the chairman.

771
01:10:53,211 --> 01:10:55,212
It's because of you, Fellow Korean lad.

772
01:10:55,212 --> 01:10:57,520
Soonyang Motors' incredible operating loss.

773
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:01,082
How will they cover that? Through the financial affiliates.

774
01:11:01,082 --> 01:11:03,552
Jin Yang Cheol wants to use

775
01:11:03,552 --> 01:11:05,351
the financial affiliates as his personal wallet

776
01:11:05,351 --> 01:11:07,762
which is why he recommended his youngest grandson

777
01:11:07,762 --> 01:11:09,699
as the holding company CEO.

778
01:11:09,699 --> 01:11:14,170
That's why the others must ensure you do not win the vote.

779
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:16,873
Well... That is very convincing.

780
01:11:16,873 --> 01:11:18,601
The timing is even better.

781
01:11:18,601 --> 01:11:22,476
The shareholder meeting is in June, and the new car release is in May.

782
01:11:22,476 --> 01:11:26,741
If the new car Apollo is a flop, stock prices will plummet.

783
01:11:26,741 --> 01:11:30,042
The vote will happen when the shareholders are furious.

784
01:11:30,042 --> 01:11:33,951
Even I'd want to vote against CEO Jin Yang Cheol.

785
01:11:39,352 --> 01:11:42,792
CEO Oh. When is the shareholder meeting again?

786
01:11:42,792 --> 01:11:44,362
In June.

787
01:11:44,362 --> 01:11:46,592
June...

788
01:11:59,171 --> 01:12:00,741
June.

789
01:12:04,211 --> 01:12:06,112
June...

790
01:12:09,322 --> 01:12:11,952
 - Go, Korea! 
 - Go, Korea! 

791
01:12:12,791 --> 01:12:15,362
 - Go, Korea! 
 - Go, Korea! 

792
01:12:16,222 --> 01:12:18,831
 - Go, Korea! 
 - Go, Korea! 

793
01:12:20,010 --> 01:12:26,920


794
01:12:27,871 --> 01:12:32,470
   

795
01:12:32,470 --> 01:12:37,960
♫  I am falling into a deeper place  ♫

796
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:43,120
♫  I’m afraid I won’t be able  ♫

797
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:47,320
♫  to return to my rightful place anymore  ♫

798
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:50,550
♫   In the end  ♫

799
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,800
♫   I can't breathe,   ♫

800
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,950
♫   no, I can't breathe  ♫

801
01:12:56,950 --> 01:13:00,010
♫   In the end  ♫

802
01:13:01,730 --> 01:13:03,900
♫   let me live  ♫

803
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:07,920
♫   please let me live.  ♫

804
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:11,287
 Will you delegate me all rights and authority to Apollo? 

805
01:13:11,287 --> 01:13:12,989
 It's for the better, Vice Chairman. 

806
01:13:12,989 --> 01:13:17,960
 If Apollo flops, Do Jun will have to shoulder the blame. 

807
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:22,064
  Min Yeong. That investigation... Can't you just drop it? 

808
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:23,792
 That's why prosecutors exist. 

809
01:13:23,792 --> 01:13:28,491
 No matter how much money or power they have, there should be things you can't do. 

810
01:13:28,491 --> 01:13:30,539
 I should revise my written will. 

811
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:36,832
 Yoon Ki's mom, you must have resented me a great deal. 

812
01:13:36,832 --> 01:13:41,781
 I'm thinking of living more like your grandmother. 

813
01:13:42,941 --> 01:13:45,781
 Chairman Jin! 

814
01:13:46,552 --> 01:13:49,980
 Grandfather. 

815
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:55,100
♫  I’m afraid I won’t be able  ♫

816
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:57,300
♫  to return to my rightful place anymore  ♫
