1
00:00:05,197 --> 00:00:07,438
Thanks, Hyeon Min.

2
00:00:09,768 --> 00:00:15,137
I told him to pay handsomely for the painting.

3
00:00:15,137 --> 00:00:16,547
Okay.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,980


5
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,249
I heard you wanted to see me.

6
00:00:33,249 --> 00:00:34,998
Yes.

7
00:00:36,397 --> 00:00:39,767
As they say, whoever tied the knot must untie it.

8
00:00:40,567 --> 00:00:44,368
I should undo the knot I tied.

9
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,593
Before it's too late, we should make sure Seong Jun

10
00:00:49,593 --> 00:00:53,232
can return to where he belongs, my niece-in-law.

11
00:00:53,232 --> 00:00:57,618
But Grandfather is still very angry.

12
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:05,372
Do you know when people become desperate?

13
00:01:06,098 --> 00:01:08,528
When they have no plan B.

14
00:01:08,528 --> 00:01:14,598
But my father happens to have two useful grandsons.

15
00:01:17,168 --> 00:01:19,508
I'm not quite following.

16
00:01:24,048 --> 00:01:26,277
I'm just saying, don't worry too much.

17
00:01:26,277 --> 00:01:27,348
Seong Jun has me.

18
00:01:27,348 --> 00:01:31,888
And more importantly, his powerful in-laws have his back,

19
00:01:31,888 --> 00:01:36,087
which my youngest nephew Do Jun doesn't have.

20
00:01:41,798 --> 00:01:44,018
Father, you should see this.

21
00:01:44,018 --> 00:01:46,168
This is all over the Internet right now.

22
00:01:46,168 --> 00:01:50,974
Everyone is calling Seong Jun "the third-generation leader fit for the new millennium."

23
00:01:50,974 --> 00:01:54,537
His easygoing nature and how he takes care of his employees and even their families

24
00:01:54,537 --> 00:01:56,962
are setting a new trend.

25
00:01:57,747 --> 00:01:59,177
Hey.

26
00:02:02,948 --> 00:02:04,518
Father.

27
00:02:06,488 --> 00:02:12,187
It's time Seong Jun returned to the head office.

28
00:02:13,358 --> 00:02:17,867
Public opinion has turned against us because of Do Jun. It'll look good in the media.

29
00:02:17,867 --> 00:02:19,897
"Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's eldest grandson."

30
00:02:19,897 --> 00:02:23,638
"Soonyang's third-generation heir is being trained."

31
00:02:23,638 --> 00:02:27,067
"Look, here's the real deal."

32
00:02:30,508 --> 00:02:34,847
Father, should we talk to Seong Jun's in-laws?

33
00:02:36,147 --> 00:02:37,948
- Hyeon Min. 
 - Yes.

34
00:02:37,948 --> 00:02:39,948
Forget it.

35
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:44,557
Would you believe it if you saw it in Hyunsung Daily?

36
00:02:45,484 --> 00:02:51,098
Everyone knows that your son is married to the daughter of the Hyunsung Daily family.

37
00:02:51,098 --> 00:02:52,698
Father.

38
00:02:52,698 --> 00:02:56,568
Then what do you plan to do with Seong Jun?

39
00:03:06,447 --> 00:03:11,048
   

40
00:03:11,048 --> 00:03:15,387
   

41
00:03:18,287 --> 00:03:20,747
   

42
00:03:21,698 --> 00:03:27,697
You now have Grandfather's permission to transfer to the head office in Gwanghwamun.

43
00:03:27,697 --> 00:03:30,308
As for your new position, he'd like to discuss it with you first.

44
00:03:30,308 --> 00:03:32,208
So think about what you'd want.

45
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:35,978
Make sure you tie up all the loose ends, and then come up.

46
00:03:41,377 --> 00:03:42,888
   

47
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:45,418
This was you, right?

48
00:03:47,488 --> 00:03:50,188
So? Did you come here to gloat?

49
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,927
At this late hour?

50
00:03:57,537 --> 00:04:02,452
Now that my exile has come to an end thanks to you and your family's scheme,

51
00:04:02,452 --> 00:04:04,792
do you want me to bow to you on my knees?

52
00:04:05,808 --> 00:04:07,937
Sure, try it.

53
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:15,378
I bet the girls you used to fool around with have no idea how annoying it is,

54
00:04:15,378 --> 00:04:20,547
and how much it costs to be your wife.

55
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:24,387
Is it fun to live like this?

56
00:04:28,827 --> 00:04:30,867
This keeps getting more interesting.

57
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:32,597
I'm here to warn you.

58
00:04:32,597 --> 00:04:34,746
I worked hard to create this opportunity for you.

59
00:04:34,746 --> 00:04:37,367
Don't blow it.

60
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:42,377
Get it together from now on, will you?

61
00:04:45,747 --> 00:04:48,518
   

62
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:36,030
♫   The darkened sky is coming down   ♫

63
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:46,010
♫   Resting against the scattering starlight   ♫

64
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:50,380
♫   Rather than counting the times    ♫

65
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,378
There's nothing. I couldn't find anything. 
   ♫   we walked    ♫

66
00:05:54,378 --> 00:05:55,617
What?

67
00:05:55,617 --> 00:06:00,090
Hold on.  
        ♫   toward a very distant place   ♫

68
00:06:02,548 --> 00:06:04,887
One moment.     
    ♫   I close my eyes.    ♫

69
00:06:04,887 --> 00:06:06,898
As for New Data Technology's shares,

70
00:06:06,898 --> 00:06:09,058
it's true that Miracle bought them low and sold them high.

71
00:06:09,058 --> 00:06:11,367
It's also true Miracle bought a large number of shares.

72
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:15,770
However, to prove that they rigged the market...

73
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:20,638
Yes, we'd need evidence that they influenced the share adjustment somehow.

74
00:06:20,638 --> 00:06:22,438
But there is none.

75
00:06:22,438 --> 00:06:24,948
No borrowed-name accounts, that are used for stock manipulation,

76
00:06:24,948 --> 00:06:26,547
and no cross trades.

77
00:06:26,547 --> 00:06:27,721
Most importantly,

78
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:31,608
when Miracle bought a large amount of the shares, the share price didn't even go up.

79
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:35,500
So there is no evidence that Miracle manipulated the share price...

80
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,370
♫   I’ll protect you forever   ♫

81
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,297
Sorry.

82
00:06:41,297 --> 00:06:44,717
Of course, you already know. I rambled too long, didn't I?

83
00:06:44,717 --> 00:06:46,667
You've been cleared of all charges.

84
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:49,867
I wanted to tell you as soon as I could,

85
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,330
so I rushed here.

86
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:56,540
♫   The night is permeated by your smile   ♫

87
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,380
Have you eaten?

88
00:07:01,578 --> 00:07:05,710
Did you have dinner?

89
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:10,470
♫   That voice of yours   ♫

90
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:14,580
♫   shines brightly   ♫

91
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:19,050
♫   on this path I’ve been walking alone   ♫

92
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,720
♫   I imagine    ♫

93
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,200
This was the last day

94
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:28,578
of your investigating me as a prosecutor.

95
00:07:28,578 --> 00:07:30,280
It won't happen again.

96
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,500
♫   Even the time I hesitated out of fear   ♫

97
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,840
I promise.

98
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,190
♫   it was always you   ♫

99
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,510
♫   now like the first time   ♫

100
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:50,180
♫   now, this moment too.   ♫

101
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,190
   

102
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:00,777
Thank you.

103
00:08:02,998 --> 00:08:04,798
Let's go.

104
00:08:07,848 --> 00:08:09,348
A financial holding company?

105
00:08:09,348 --> 00:08:10,988
On the outside, it'd look like a financial company.

106
00:08:10,988 --> 00:08:14,958
But it'll be like the control tower of Soonyang's succession plans.

107
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:20,788
Then who will run that company?

108
00:08:27,968 --> 00:08:31,068
Do Jun, why don't you run it?

109
00:08:33,437 --> 00:08:34,708
Pardon?

110
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,848
Why? Don't you want to?

111
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:49,388
Once we arrive at the rice mill in Incheon, we will hold a press conference first.

112
00:08:49,388 --> 00:08:51,927
A board meeting has been scheduled for next week as well.

113
00:08:51,927 --> 00:08:55,627
Formally introduce yourself and get to work.

114
00:08:55,627 --> 00:08:59,498
Get a certificate of incorporation for the company too.

115
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:01,827
As for the shareholders' meeting...

116
00:09:04,507 --> 00:09:07,207
You can take care of that too, right?

117
00:09:13,777 --> 00:09:18,748
Do you really plan on handing the company over to me?

118
00:09:19,588 --> 00:09:23,157
I can see the burning greed for money in your eyes.

119
00:09:23,157 --> 00:09:26,157
You're so greedy for money that you don't fear me,

120
00:09:27,197 --> 00:09:31,367
and you're ruthless even with your family and relatives.

121
00:09:32,568 --> 00:09:39,198
You're ill-tempered just like me.

122
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,808
Soonyang Financial Group,

123
00:09:45,608 --> 00:09:51,977
I'm going to give it to you.

124
00:10:18,848 --> 00:10:22,977
 Now, I know the reason why... 

125
00:10:23,855 --> 00:10:27,054
 I remember nothing about 4-2, Jin Do Jun. 

126
00:10:28,017 --> 00:10:29,458
   

127
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:33,927
 It's because I died. 

128
00:10:36,797 --> 00:10:38,597
 And 

129
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:48,568
 things that are bound to happen always happen, without fail. 

130
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:55,247
   

131
00:10:55,247 --> 00:10:57,547
 It's automatically translated in an instant. 

132
00:10:57,547 --> 00:11:00,917
 The automatic translation service is available in six languages. 

133
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:03,387
 This is the era where voice recognition and automatic translation services 

134
00:11:03,387 --> 00:11:06,797
 can be used by anyone with a computer. 

135
00:11:06,797 --> 00:11:08,127
 This is just in. 

136
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:10,828
 - Reporter Joo is reporting live from the scene. 
 - The person you have reached cannot be... 

137
00:11:10,828 --> 00:11:13,368
 So have the police confirmed the identities of the passengers? 

138
00:11:13,368 --> 00:11:16,068
 Earlier today, on a road on the outskirts of Incheon, 

139
00:11:16,068 --> 00:11:19,137
 a multi-vehicle collision occurred, and one of the vehicles belongs 

140
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:22,838
 to Chairman Jin Yang Cheol, who was headed to Soonyang Museum. 

141
00:11:22,838 --> 00:11:25,247
 A, the driver of the freight truck 

142
00:11:25,247 --> 00:11:28,647
 who was driving on the other side of the road, died on the spot. 

143
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,818
 Chairman Jin and his grandson, Jin Do Jun, 

144
00:11:30,818 --> 00:11:32,917
 who was also in the car at the time of the accident, 

145
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:34,958
 have been transported to a hospital nearby for treatment. 

146
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,488
 The police suspect that the accident occurred 

147
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,958
 because A was driving under the influence of alcohol. 

148
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:43,127
 They will launch an investigation to find out... 

149
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:46,068
He'll be okay, right?

150
00:11:46,068 --> 00:11:48,397
His grandfather owns Soonyang Group.

151
00:11:48,397 --> 00:11:51,738
He'll be treated by the best doctors in the country.

152
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:54,677
Don't worry too much.

153
00:11:54,677 --> 00:11:57,137
   

154
00:12:05,818 --> 00:12:07,500
   

155
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,727
Young Ki, your father... Where is he?

156
00:12:11,727 --> 00:12:14,427
What are you waiting for? Take me to him at once!

157
00:12:14,427 --> 00:12:16,728
Director Jung will come out shortly, Ma'am.

158
00:12:16,728 --> 00:12:18,997
He'll tell us how Chairman is doing.

159
00:12:18,997 --> 00:12:21,817
You should brace yourself for the worst, Mother.

160
00:12:21,817 --> 00:12:26,137
It was a big accident.

161
00:12:35,317 --> 00:12:37,718
Let me in, Director Jung.

162
00:12:37,718 --> 00:12:40,018
I must see my husband.

163
00:12:40,018 --> 00:12:41,895
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

164
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:46,527
Chairman needs absolute rest at the moment.

165
00:12:46,527 --> 00:12:47,958
For the time being,

166
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,767
no visitors are allowed, including all family members.

167
00:12:50,767 --> 00:12:52,997
How is he?

168
00:12:52,997 --> 00:12:55,797
How badly is he hurt that we can't even see him?

169
00:12:55,797 --> 00:12:58,268
Must he undergo emergency surgery or something?

170
00:12:58,268 --> 00:13:03,107
At the moment, Chairman is in a coma.

171
00:13:07,478 --> 00:13:12,088
Are you saying he may never wake up? My father?

172
00:13:12,088 --> 00:13:17,757
Then should we prepare for the worst, Director Jung?

173
00:13:19,157 --> 00:13:21,697
What's with you, Oppa Young Ki?

174
00:13:21,697 --> 00:13:23,697
It's as if you've been waiting for this to happen.

175
00:13:23,697 --> 00:13:27,167
If they can't treat him here, we should take him to the US.

176
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,368
That's what we must do, as his children!

177
00:13:28,368 --> 00:13:31,728
This also means that the chairman of Soonyang is in a coma.

178
00:13:33,638 --> 00:13:38,047
When the stock market opens on Monday, our stocks will plummet.

179
00:13:38,047 --> 00:13:41,277
And in an emergency situation like this,

180
00:13:41,277 --> 00:13:45,118
the person who should make decisions on behalf of father is me, his eldest son.

181
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,027
Now, tell us, Director Jung.

182
00:13:52,027 --> 00:13:55,157
Will he wake up?

183
00:13:55,157 --> 00:13:57,022
At the moment,

184
00:13:57,022 --> 00:14:01,823
all I can tell you is that my team and I will do our very best.

185
00:14:06,807 --> 00:14:08,937
Do Jun... Where is Do Jun?

186
00:14:08,937 --> 00:14:10,677
We received a call from the Secretary's Office.

187
00:14:10,677 --> 00:14:12,508
What was Do Jun doing there at that hour?

188
00:14:12,508 --> 00:14:14,378
- We heard... 
 - What happened, Hyungnim?

189
00:14:14,378 --> 00:14:18,247
We heard Do Jun was in the car with Father.

190
00:14:18,247 --> 00:14:20,888
Do Jun is okay, right?

191
00:14:20,888 --> 00:14:24,188
Say something!

192
00:14:24,188 --> 00:14:25,887
Oh, dear.

193
00:14:49,477 --> 00:14:52,817
The surgery went well.

194
00:14:53,758 --> 00:14:55,358
I see.

195
00:14:56,286 --> 00:14:58,828
Thank you. Thank you so much, Doctor.

196
00:14:58,828 --> 00:15:00,998
As for the neurosurgical concerns I had,

197
00:15:00,998 --> 00:15:03,027
the injury on the back of his head is only external.

198
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,927
Thankfully, there is no intracranial hemorrhage.

199
00:15:04,927 --> 00:15:07,297
So, all in all, the surgery went well.

200
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:08,997
I see.

201
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:14,908
Will he experience any post-surgical complications?

202
00:15:14,908 --> 00:15:18,577
At the moment, I don't think you should be too worried,

203
00:15:18,577 --> 00:15:21,107
but let's wait and see.

204
00:15:21,107 --> 00:15:23,318
If there's anything you need while treating or helping him recover,

205
00:15:23,318 --> 00:15:24,747
don't hesitate to let me know.

206
00:15:24,747 --> 00:15:26,348
We'll give you all the support you need.

207
00:15:26,348 --> 00:15:31,188
He must have a key position in the company.

208
00:15:34,628 --> 00:15:38,968
I'm just hugely indebted to him.

209
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:45,738
Oh, they're moving him to the recovery room now.

210
00:17:03,817 --> 00:17:05,587
Grandfather.

211
00:17:08,988 --> 00:17:10,918
Grandfather.

212
00:17:10,918 --> 00:17:15,258
Grandfather. Please...

213
00:17:15,258 --> 00:17:17,327
Grandfather.

214
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:21,037
- Grandfather. 
 - Sir, are you all right?

215
00:17:21,037 --> 00:17:22,098
Call an ambulance.

216
00:17:22,098 --> 00:17:24,137
- Yes. 
 - Grandfather.

217
00:17:24,137 --> 00:17:26,068
Hurry!

218
00:17:26,068 --> 00:17:28,837
- Sir. 
 - Grandfather!

219
00:17:28,837 --> 00:17:30,908
Grandfather.

220
00:17:30,908 --> 00:17:32,847
Grandfather.

221
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:59,112
Mr. Ha was bringing a suit for the press conference as per Mr. Lee Hang Jae's order.

222
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:04,207
This was found in one of the pockets of the truck driver who is now dead.

223
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:06,107
You should take a look.

224
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:13,718
I thought you should know before the police launched their investigation.

225
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,617
This wasn't a simple accident.

226
00:18:17,617 --> 00:18:22,558
From the beginning, the chairman's car was the target.

227
00:18:24,027 --> 00:18:25,667
   

228
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:30,937
   

229
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:39,156
Someone must be behind this.

230
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,957
Find out who ordered this and bring them to me.

231
00:18:54,657 --> 00:18:56,427
 I know... 

232
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:05,637
 that everything that happened in my previous life will happen in this life, too. 

233
00:19:08,508 --> 00:19:10,373
 In my previous life, 

234
00:19:11,263 --> 00:19:14,422
 I died at your hands, as Yoon Hyeon Woo. 

235
00:19:15,418 --> 00:19:20,348
 In this life, I was born again as Jin Do Jun. 

236
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:24,862
 And I refuse to die at your hands once again. 

237
00:19:30,327 --> 00:19:32,568
 I must live. 

238
00:19:33,268 --> 00:19:40,038
 I will survive no matter what and find the answer. 

239
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:50,348
I'm here, Grandfather.

240
00:19:50,348 --> 00:19:52,818
Hey, Do Jun.

241
00:19:54,617 --> 00:20:02,187
 The secret behind my second life. 

242
00:20:10,433 --> 00:20:13,147
Considering the impact it would have on the stock market,

243
00:20:13,147 --> 00:20:17,178
I suggest we keep the chairman's condition confidential for the time being.

244
00:20:17,178 --> 00:20:19,948
Then what about the press release?

245
00:20:19,948 --> 00:20:25,277
We'll write that he's staying at Soonyang Medical Center to recover as per his doctors' advice.

246
00:20:25,277 --> 00:20:30,588
What are some of the things on Father's schedule that I should take care of urgently?

247
00:20:31,286 --> 00:20:33,366
Mr. Chairman was supposed to announce the establishment

248
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:36,797
of our financial holding company at a press conference today.

249
00:20:36,797 --> 00:20:41,307
And he would've gotten the board members to agree on it at the board meeting next week.

250
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:43,537
Let's postpone the board meeting.

251
00:20:43,537 --> 00:20:46,238
Establishing the financial holding company...

252
00:20:46,238 --> 00:20:47,607
Let's put it on hold for now.

253
00:20:47,607 --> 00:20:48,738
Yes, I agree.

254
00:20:48,738 --> 00:20:50,777
It can be done once Father wakes up.

255
00:20:50,777 --> 00:20:52,208
It's nothing urgent.

256
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,377
You all know that...

257
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,857
Chairman firmly believes the financial industry is where Soonyang's future lies...

258
00:20:55,857 --> 00:20:58,117
It's the old man's trickery.

259
00:20:58,117 --> 00:21:00,018
Who here doesn't know that?

260
00:21:00,018 --> 00:21:01,957
Watch your mouth.

261
00:21:01,957 --> 00:21:04,488
- Father isn't well. 
 - My point, exactly.

262
00:21:04,488 --> 00:21:08,498
Father is bedridden now. Nothing good will come out of people talking about it.

263
00:21:08,498 --> 00:21:12,027
Chang Je, I heard the politicians aren't keen on it, either.

264
00:21:12,027 --> 00:21:13,568
They say it violates the separation of banking and commerce.

265
00:21:13,568 --> 00:21:14,837
Yes, that's right.

266
00:21:14,837 --> 00:21:16,838
That's why Father said he wanted to support

267
00:21:16,838 --> 00:21:20,508
a presidential candidate who'd ease the rules of separation of banking and commerce.

268
00:21:20,508 --> 00:21:22,978
Then it would be resolved right away, I suppose.

269
00:21:22,978 --> 00:21:24,248
He asked you one question.

270
00:21:24,248 --> 00:21:27,848
Why ramble on, and spoil the mood?

271
00:21:28,618 --> 00:21:30,177
All right.

272
00:21:31,047 --> 00:21:32,487
My point is...

273
00:21:32,487 --> 00:21:35,787
Whether we want to push Cheongwadae or influence the National Assembly,

274
00:21:35,787 --> 00:21:38,758
we can't do it without Father.

275
00:21:38,758 --> 00:21:40,287
Am I wrong, Hyungnim Young Ki?

276
00:21:40,287 --> 00:21:42,127
- Mr. Lee. 
 - Yes, Sir.

277
00:21:42,127 --> 00:21:46,668
As for the board meeting, we will proceed as planned.

278
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:48,409
Oppa Young Ki!

279
00:21:48,409 --> 00:21:54,186
We cannot leave Father's position vacant.

280
00:21:54,186 --> 00:21:56,337
I'll fill in for him.

281
00:22:08,086 --> 00:22:11,257
Hyungnim Young Ki, Father has blindsided you so many times.

282
00:22:11,257 --> 00:22:16,257
Do you still not get the picture? Are you dumb?

283
00:22:16,257 --> 00:22:19,328
He wants Do Jun to run the financial holding company.

284
00:22:19,328 --> 00:22:21,238
Do you not understand what that means?

285
00:22:21,238 --> 00:22:23,738
I bet you have no idea.

286
00:22:23,738 --> 00:22:28,377
He'll sponsor the presidential candidate who'd ease the regulations on the separation,

287
00:22:28,377 --> 00:22:30,278
so the head of the financial holding company

288
00:22:30,278 --> 00:22:32,778
could go on to rule the entire Soonyang Group. In other words, he has chosen

289
00:22:32,778 --> 00:22:35,578
that fool Yoon Ki's son, Do Jun, as his successor.

290
00:22:35,578 --> 00:22:38,618
You're so afraid of Father that you have nothing to your name.

291
00:22:38,618 --> 00:22:41,187
Now, you'll take what rightfully belongs to your son

292
00:22:41,187 --> 00:22:44,087
and put it in Do Jun's mouth?

293
00:22:44,087 --> 00:22:46,328
Aren't you too embarrassed to even face Seong Jun?

294
00:22:46,328 --> 00:22:47,457
That's enough, Uncle Dong Ki.

295
00:22:47,457 --> 00:22:49,897
You too! Get it together!

296
00:22:49,897 --> 00:22:51,897
Or you'll end up becoming a puppet like your father.

297
00:22:51,897 --> 00:22:53,939
What did you say?

298
00:22:54,598 --> 00:22:56,368
You little...

299
00:22:56,368 --> 00:22:59,037
Enough, both of you!

300
00:23:01,337 --> 00:23:04,507
Your father was right about you guys.

301
00:23:04,507 --> 00:23:10,585
I know I birthed you guys, but what is wrong with all of you?

302
00:23:10,585 --> 00:23:12,818
Knowing that your father is on the verge of dying,

303
00:23:12,818 --> 00:23:16,389
how dare you worry about what you might lose or gain first?

304
00:23:16,389 --> 00:23:18,329
Mom.

305
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:21,728
I can't believe I have to see this.

306
00:23:21,728 --> 00:23:23,827
Calm down, Mother. You might faint at this rate.

307
00:23:23,827 --> 00:23:25,367
Forget it.

308
00:23:25,367 --> 00:23:27,498
Get out, all of you!

309
00:23:27,498 --> 00:23:29,637
I'm afraid your father would never wake up

310
00:23:29,637 --> 00:23:32,467
because he doesn't want to see the fools that you are!

311
00:23:32,467 --> 00:23:36,077
Why would you say that, Mom!

312
00:23:36,077 --> 00:23:38,508
Mom, go home and get some rest.

313
00:23:38,508 --> 00:23:41,447
We can't even see him anyway!

314
00:23:43,518 --> 00:23:44,817
Let's go home, Mother.

315
00:23:44,817 --> 00:23:49,788
I'm sure Do Jun's family will stay here anyway.

316
00:23:49,788 --> 00:23:52,941
You look so weary, Mother.

317
00:23:52,941 --> 00:23:56,598
We'll take you home. Let's go to Jeongsimjae, okay?

318
00:23:56,598 --> 00:23:57,998
Forget it.

319
00:23:57,998 --> 00:24:01,668
All my life, I've always stayed right by his side.

320
00:24:01,668 --> 00:24:04,868
He'll look for me the moment he wakes up.

321
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,421
Heed my advice.

322
00:24:09,421 --> 00:24:11,377
Do not raise your voices in front of me again.

323
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:24,428
Mother must still care for him very much, even at her age.

324
00:24:24,428 --> 00:24:27,067
Let's be honest. Without my mom's support,

325
00:24:27,067 --> 00:24:29,827
he wouldn't have been able to grow Soonyang into what it is today.

326
00:24:29,827 --> 00:24:31,398
No way.

327
00:24:31,398 --> 00:24:34,367
You should be good to me, too.

328
00:24:34,367 --> 00:24:35,968
Don't you remember what Mr. Baek said?

329
00:24:35,968 --> 00:24:39,738
In your fortune reading, you're blessed with rich parents first, and then a good wife.

330
00:24:39,738 --> 00:24:41,637
Mr. Baek is never wrong, you know.

331
00:24:41,637 --> 00:24:43,637
What do you think will happen with my father?

332
00:24:43,637 --> 00:24:45,778
Will he wake up?

333
00:24:45,778 --> 00:24:48,307
Yes, I believe so.

334
00:24:49,377 --> 00:24:50,947
What?

335
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,988
- Will he wake up? 
 - Yes.

336
00:24:52,988 --> 00:24:54,617
According to his reading, he's extremely strong.

337
00:24:54,617 --> 00:24:56,557
He'll never succumb to accident injuries or illnesses.

338
00:24:56,557 --> 00:25:00,032
And he certainly won't pass away this year.

339
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:02,428
Darn it, why...

340
00:25:02,428 --> 00:25:04,768
Why are you telling me this now?

341
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,328
Because you asked me just now, Sir.

342
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,797
Don't step in, Honey.

343
00:25:08,797 --> 00:25:10,867
Let them start the financial holding company or whatever.

344
00:25:10,867 --> 00:25:12,807
Just stay out of it.

345
00:25:12,807 --> 00:25:15,808
If Father wakes up, he'll be very angry.

346
00:25:15,808 --> 00:25:19,707
It's so easy for you to say. You have no idea how I feel right now.

347
00:25:19,707 --> 00:25:23,048
Mr. Baek, whom you trust so much, told me

348
00:25:23,048 --> 00:25:26,025
that once Do Jun survived a life-threatening incident,

349
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,918
he'd become unbeatable...

350
00:25:28,918 --> 00:25:29,988
What was it?

351
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:32,458
- Astronomical wealth... 
 - Yes!

352
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:34,528
- What? 
 - Money will fall into his lap.

353
00:25:34,528 --> 00:25:37,258
That's right! Do I really have to

354
00:25:37,258 --> 00:25:41,968
let that lucky brat eat up the financial holding company too?

355
00:25:45,868 --> 00:25:47,708
Let me see.

356
00:26:21,607 --> 00:26:25,478
You have to attend the executive meeting in the morning.

357
00:26:44,027 --> 00:26:47,298
Just finish this and go to bed early, Father.

358
00:26:48,597 --> 00:26:51,367
Don't worry, Seong Jun.

359
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:55,637
Your uncle is right.

360
00:26:57,577 --> 00:27:00,847
I will cancel the board meeting.

361
00:27:04,188 --> 00:27:06,795
I will go ahead and cancel the plan

362
00:27:07,448 --> 00:27:11,558
to establish the financial holding company.

363
00:27:11,558 --> 00:27:13,758
Father.

364
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:18,998
I should have protected you.

365
00:27:21,537 --> 00:27:24,017
I'm too embarrassed even to face you.

366
00:27:32,648 --> 00:27:35,947
But earlier, I agreed with what you said.

367
00:27:37,918 --> 00:27:41,787
Follow Grandpa's wishes regarding the financial holding company.

368
00:27:42,918 --> 00:27:45,658
They might end up being his last wishes.

369
00:27:46,527 --> 00:27:53,097
You are his only rightful successor, Father.

370
00:28:10,417 --> 00:28:12,217
Sir, as per your instructions,

371
00:28:12,217 --> 00:28:15,417
the police have concluded that the truck driver was drunk

372
00:28:15,417 --> 00:28:17,457
and experienced brake issues, which caused the accident.

373
00:28:17,457 --> 00:28:19,887
They will go ahead and close the case.

374
00:28:19,887 --> 00:28:24,427
The police suspect the sedan that took off after the initial collision was a stolen vehicle.

375
00:28:24,427 --> 00:28:28,138
They're watching the CCTV footage to track it,

376
00:28:28,138 --> 00:28:30,468
but Mr. Woo thinks...

377
00:28:34,448 --> 00:28:38,273
since it was a highly elaborate accident, the car is probably already scrapped...

378
00:28:38,273 --> 00:28:39,978
Stop.

379
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:46,248
You can stop there.

380
00:28:48,858 --> 00:28:52,831
We should tell Grandmother. She must be devastated.

381
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:56,227
She's a speaker.

382
00:28:56,227 --> 00:29:00,998
Once she finds out, even Tom and Mary in New York will find out.

383
00:29:00,998 --> 00:29:04,798
Are you trying to mess it up?

384
00:29:06,868 --> 00:29:11,277
Warn Mr. Woo so that it won't leak.

385
00:29:11,277 --> 00:29:13,647
Yes, Sir. You don't need to worry.

386
00:29:13,647 --> 00:29:17,847
It won't only humiliate the family but put an end to Soonyang.

387
00:29:17,847 --> 00:29:22,258
How are we going to ask our clients and shareholders to trust us?

388
00:29:23,457 --> 00:29:30,687
Do you really think one of the three children planned this?

389
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:32,868
The situation is evident.

390
00:29:32,868 --> 00:29:35,897
Mr. Yang has never caused even a minor accident since he started working for me.

391
00:29:35,897 --> 00:29:37,768
It wasn't even his first trip.

392
00:29:37,768 --> 00:29:42,138
Why on the way to the press conference of all times? Why that day, at that time?

393
00:29:43,377 --> 00:29:45,908
I can never give up on the financial holding company,

394
00:29:45,908 --> 00:29:49,518
and they'll never hand it over to Do Jun.

395
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,288
The one who goes to the board meeting

396
00:29:54,288 --> 00:29:56,061
and stops the establishment

397
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:59,542
of the holding company is the culprit of this accident.

398
00:29:59,542 --> 00:30:01,597
That's what I think.

399
00:30:01,597 --> 00:30:05,867
I'm going to the board meeting no matter what so I can see his face!

400
00:30:05,867 --> 00:30:10,898
When they see their father is fine, they will flip out.

401
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,038
You'll be laughing in your sleep.

402
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:16,677
This is a rare sight.

403
00:30:16,677 --> 00:30:20,848
Because it's me. Only Jin Yang Cheol can do this.

404
00:30:28,588 --> 00:30:31,487
He must be tired.

405
00:30:33,588 --> 00:30:36,857
I will come back tomorrow.

406
00:30:36,857 --> 00:30:39,327
Rest well, Chairman.

407
00:30:43,998 --> 00:30:45,808
Goodnight, Mr. Lee.

408
00:31:02,057 --> 00:31:06,687
Medical Director Jung told me you weren't well.

409
00:31:11,268 --> 00:31:14,828
Is that why you're rushing

410
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,237
to establish the financial holding company,

411
00:31:19,237 --> 00:31:21,697
and leaving the Soonyang chairman position to me?

412
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:33,266
As soon as you get up tomorrow, make a call

413
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,757
to the press team in the PR Department.

414
00:31:36,818 --> 00:31:38,418
Okay?

415
00:31:39,157 --> 00:31:41,799
Look at this.

416
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:45,527
The car is smashed into pieces,

417
00:31:45,527 --> 00:31:49,538
but no one is dead.

418
00:31:51,607 --> 00:31:54,878
That is Soonyang's car.

419
00:31:54,878 --> 00:31:58,337
Soonyang Motors.

420
00:32:00,108 --> 00:32:03,217
You know?

421
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:12,327
I can't believe it was possible.

422
00:32:12,327 --> 00:32:14,588
It was possible.

423
00:32:21,897 --> 00:32:23,467
Okay, Grandfather.

424
00:32:23,467 --> 00:32:27,368
I'll call the press team to prepare the press release.

425
00:32:27,368 --> 00:32:31,877
Soonyang Motors' highest priority was safety.

426
00:32:31,877 --> 00:32:33,908
Behind it...

427
00:32:34,778 --> 00:32:38,448
was Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's struggle

428
00:32:38,448 --> 00:32:41,331
who never gave up

429
00:32:41,331 --> 00:32:45,132
despite inferiority in the market in the past ten years.

430
00:32:54,868 --> 00:32:57,437
You should go to sleep.

431
00:33:08,647 --> 00:33:10,248
Do Jun.

432
00:33:13,587 --> 00:33:16,987
Promise me

433
00:33:21,628 --> 00:33:24,157
that you'll be careful.

434
00:33:26,197 --> 00:33:28,568
Don't trust anyone.

435
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:38,808
Okay.

436
00:33:40,578 --> 00:33:41,878
All right.

437
00:33:47,447 --> 00:33:48,887
Okay.

438
00:33:50,518 --> 00:33:52,557
You should get going.

439
00:33:58,898 --> 00:34:00,527
   

440
00:34:08,607 --> 00:34:10,408
Do Jun.

441
00:34:12,907 --> 00:34:14,678
Yes, Grandfather?

442
00:34:16,317 --> 00:34:20,778
Do you...still...

443
00:34:23,858 --> 00:34:26,827
want to buy Soonyang?

444
00:35:16,078 --> 00:35:19,708
Are you okay? Are you hurt a lot?

445
00:35:19,708 --> 00:35:21,708
Let me see.

446
00:35:27,188 --> 00:35:29,757
You should've told me if you were okay.

447
00:35:29,757 --> 00:35:33,458
I couldn't reach you all day. I was worried about you.

448
00:35:40,697 --> 00:35:45,437
It wasn't just an accident. Was it?

449
00:36:15,438 --> 00:36:17,267
Having trouble sleeping?

450
00:36:18,237 --> 00:36:21,367
Normally, you'd be in bed by now.

451
00:36:24,848 --> 00:36:27,507
I guess you're worried about Do Jun.

452
00:36:28,777 --> 00:36:32,148
The oldest daughter-in-law of Soonyang is different.

453
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:35,157
You're too worried about your brother-in-law to sleep.

454
00:36:35,157 --> 00:36:38,657
Haven't you heard the doctor saying Do Jun was okay?

455
00:36:40,188 --> 00:36:44,757
That's why... I'm more worried.

456
00:36:47,368 --> 00:36:52,237
After the accident today, I thought Soonyang would be yours.

457
00:36:54,538 --> 00:36:56,477
Didn't you?

458
00:37:01,148 --> 00:37:08,977
I thought you couldn't sleep for that reason.

459
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:24,398
Only a minor scratch on all passengers.

460
00:37:24,398 --> 00:37:27,837
Chairman Jin Yang Cheol is in a coma due to a car accident.

461
00:37:28,513 --> 00:37:31,107
Is it a scratch or a coma?

462
00:37:31,107 --> 00:37:33,947
What am I supposed to buy?

463
00:37:35,148 --> 00:37:36,947
There are only ten minutes left until the market opens.

464
00:37:36,947 --> 00:37:39,548
Will you keep a secret?

465
00:37:40,987 --> 00:37:44,657
What are you doing here? I thought you were in the hospital.

466
00:37:44,657 --> 00:37:46,987
I thought it was a big accident. Wait.

467
00:37:51,673 --> 00:37:53,173
What?

468
00:37:53,997 --> 00:37:55,998
Are you really okay?

469
00:37:55,998 --> 00:37:57,668
Oh, my dear CEO Oh.

470
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:03,807
Then I'm buying 10,000 shares of Soonyang Motors today.

471
00:38:03,807 --> 00:38:06,748
Seriously. I'm disappointed.

472
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:13,925
Don't forget that you promised me to keep your secret.

473
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:19,087
The fact that they instigated the murder of their father, which was covered up as a car accident?

474
00:38:19,087 --> 00:38:23,268
Or how the father took the bait in an attempt to catch his kid?

475
00:38:23,268 --> 00:38:26,427
A secret or whatever, this is a crime.

476
00:38:26,427 --> 00:38:29,941
A secret or a crime, it'll all come to light on the day of the board meeting.

477
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:33,974
Until then, I'll be at the hospital by Chairman Jin's side.

478
00:38:33,974 --> 00:38:36,714
So what am I to do?

479
00:38:37,507 --> 00:38:40,148
Soonyang Investment will call this meeting.

480
00:38:40,148 --> 00:38:42,847
The items will be the planning of making a holding company, and stockholders meeting for the board members.

481
00:38:42,847 --> 00:38:46,917
Please take up everything related to Soonyang Financial Holding Company.

482
00:38:46,917 --> 00:38:51,917
Is that why you put me here as the CEO as soon as we took over Soonyang Investment?

483
00:38:51,917 --> 00:38:54,958
Well, in the end, yes.

484
00:38:56,298 --> 00:38:59,928
Becoming the owner of Soonyang Financial Holding Company.

485
00:39:00,768 --> 00:39:03,037
Just as you wanted, Fellow Korean Lad.

486
00:39:03,037 --> 00:39:06,267
You'll soon have Soonyang Group in your hands.

487
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,477
Are you sure about Father?

488
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:17,518
You don't have to ask again. I heard it this morning from the police commissioner himself.

489
00:39:17,518 --> 00:39:20,148
The paramedic who was on the scene said

490
00:39:20,148 --> 00:39:24,287
he didn't suffer from any injuries like broken bones after that huge accident.

491
00:39:24,287 --> 00:39:26,458
Director Jung said he was in a coma.

492
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:31,128
Even if what you said is true, why would he dare to lie against our family?

493
00:39:31,128 --> 00:39:34,268
   

494
00:39:34,268 --> 00:39:39,538
Father is testing us right now.

495
00:39:39,538 --> 00:39:40,608
Testing us?

496
00:39:40,608 --> 00:39:43,007
Everything came into the light with the financial holding company.

497
00:39:43,007 --> 00:39:45,008
The succession war has begun.

498
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:46,108
So?

499
00:39:46,108 --> 00:39:49,507
While he has fallen asleep, and while nobody else can visit him here,

500
00:39:49,507 --> 00:39:52,248
he wants to see which one of you shows your devotion

501
00:39:52,248 --> 00:39:54,887
by coming in and visiting him every single day.

502
00:39:54,887 --> 00:39:58,988
It's a sort of loyalty test.

503
00:39:58,988 --> 00:40:00,988
- A loyalty test? 
 - Yes.

504
00:40:00,988 --> 00:40:03,598
- My father? 
 - Yes.

505
00:40:04,998 --> 00:40:06,298
Stop talking nonsense.

506
00:40:06,298 --> 00:40:08,737
Haven't you read "King Lear" by Shakespeare?

507
00:40:08,737 --> 00:40:10,697
Why do you think these are called the classics?

508
00:40:10,697 --> 00:40:13,608
I'm seeing through the essence of human nature now.

509
00:40:13,608 --> 00:40:16,507
You're so frustrating. Goodness.

510
00:40:16,507 --> 00:40:19,108
I need to see my father just once.

511
00:40:19,108 --> 00:40:22,648
I'm not trying to cross over to North Korea or visit the Moon.

512
00:40:22,648 --> 00:40:26,788
I just need to visit the ICU of this hospital once.

513
00:40:26,788 --> 00:40:29,418
- Oppa Dong Ki. 
 - Huh? What?

514
00:40:34,828 --> 00:40:40,227
I heard an odd rumor today, Director Jung.

515
00:40:40,227 --> 00:40:45,637
That Chairman Jin's body did not have any external injury from the accident.

516
00:40:45,637 --> 00:40:48,738
Can he still fall into a coma despite the lack of injury?

517
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:50,378
Director Jung.

518
00:40:50,378 --> 00:40:55,177
Did you lie to all of us about Father's coma?

519
00:40:57,117 --> 00:40:59,048
Man.

520
00:40:59,048 --> 00:41:01,755
I finally get it.

521
00:41:01,755 --> 00:41:07,387
He's in a coma due to his chronic illness, cerebral arteriovenous malformation, right?

522
00:41:07,387 --> 00:41:08,827
Vice-Chairman Jin.

523
00:41:08,827 --> 00:41:10,827
Wait, what do you mean?

524
00:41:10,827 --> 00:41:13,397
His chronic illness?

525
00:41:15,837 --> 00:41:17,598
Wait.

526
00:41:19,407 --> 00:41:24,707
Why is Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki the only one who knew about this, Director Jung?

527
00:41:24,707 --> 00:41:29,378
Chairman Jin made a special request that I do not inform anyone else about this illness.

528
00:41:29,378 --> 00:41:32,088
Yet you went against his special request,

529
00:41:32,088 --> 00:41:35,188
and told Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki about it.

530
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:42,428
If my father finds out about this much later, he will feel utterly betrayed.

531
00:41:42,428 --> 00:41:46,268
I thought it would help with Chairman Jin's health care

532
00:41:46,268 --> 00:41:48,637
if at least one of his children knew about his condition.

533
00:41:48,637 --> 00:41:50,798
I'll keep the secret.

534
00:41:50,798 --> 00:41:52,567
However,

535
00:41:54,467 --> 00:41:58,838
let me see my father.

536
00:42:00,378 --> 00:42:02,878
Now. Immediately.

537
00:42:04,451 --> 00:42:06,448
Let's do that.

538
00:42:17,498 --> 00:42:24,298
Chairman Jin's family will make a visit to the ICU.

539
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:33,778
It's just this once.

540
00:42:33,778 --> 00:42:35,817
Let's go now.

541
00:42:35,817 --> 00:42:37,548
Let's go.

542
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:42,887
   

543
00:42:42,887 --> 00:42:46,188
Why did you keep Father's illness to yourself?

544
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:47,328
What were you thinking?

545
00:42:47,328 --> 00:42:49,628
I made a good pass for you to finally score.

546
00:42:49,628 --> 00:42:51,458
What's important is that we're here.

547
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:55,127
- What is this? 
 - I thought visits were prohibited.

548
00:42:55,127 --> 00:42:57,398
Was that wrong information?

549
00:42:57,398 --> 00:43:00,668
Your family insisted on seeing Chairman Jin.

550
00:43:00,668 --> 00:43:05,747
As a doctor, do you think Father is in a state to receive visitors?

551
00:43:05,747 --> 00:43:06,807
No.

552
00:43:06,807 --> 00:43:10,048
There's a danger of infection if he sees outside visitors.

553
00:43:10,048 --> 00:43:13,418
On top of that, he absolutely must rest now.

554
00:43:13,418 --> 00:43:16,218
Hey, are you the doctor here?

555
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,858
Don't step out of the line and get into this.

556
00:43:17,858 --> 00:43:22,957
I'm speaking as the chairman of Soonyang Medical Center.

557
00:43:22,957 --> 00:43:25,927
If you go against your conviction as a doctor

558
00:43:25,927 --> 00:43:28,838
and allow them to visit the ICU,

559
00:43:28,838 --> 00:43:32,608
then I will dismiss you immediately as the chairman.

560
00:43:32,608 --> 00:43:35,707
- You! 
 - If you...

561
00:43:35,707 --> 00:43:39,807
make another scene at the hospital in regard to Father,

562
00:43:39,807 --> 00:43:41,948
be ready for consequences.

563
00:43:42,817 --> 00:43:48,717
You will never get to set foot inside Soonyang Medical Center again.

564
00:43:51,117 --> 00:43:54,958
We managed to get over this, thanks to Director Jung's call.

565
00:43:55,798 --> 00:44:01,228
This family is unpredictable, so who knows when they'll barge in again?

566
00:44:01,228 --> 00:44:03,097
Thank you, Father.

567
00:44:03,097 --> 00:44:06,708
Please keep this a secret until the day of the board meeting.

568
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,493
I cannot believe this.

569
00:44:09,493 --> 00:44:11,438
Our family is...

570
00:44:11,438 --> 00:44:17,147
quite ambitious, and there are many aspects that are tough for me to understand.

571
00:44:17,147 --> 00:44:20,058
However, I never thought

572
00:44:20,058 --> 00:44:24,058
they were capable of doing something so atrocious

573
00:44:24,058 --> 00:44:27,327
against your grandfather. If I had, I...

574
00:44:31,628 --> 00:44:35,168
It wasn't a car accident?

575
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:40,667
You knew that, yet you agreed to close the police investigation?

576
00:44:40,667 --> 00:44:44,137
Well, there's a backstory.

577
00:44:44,137 --> 00:44:47,778
You said you'd make sure your family wouldn't touch Do Jun.

578
00:44:47,778 --> 00:44:50,178
Yet this is what it came down to?

579
00:44:50,178 --> 00:44:54,147
I will report to the police.

580
00:44:55,788 --> 00:44:57,618
Father...

581
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:02,950
I was the one who insisted on stopping the investigation, Mother.

582
00:45:04,328 --> 00:45:06,128
Do Jun, it was you?

583
00:45:06,128 --> 00:45:07,668
Why?

584
00:45:09,168 --> 00:45:11,338
Because I wanted to live.

585
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:21,407
If the culprit is one of us in the family,

586
00:45:21,407 --> 00:45:25,117
they'll be able to evade the police investigation.

587
00:45:25,117 --> 00:45:26,787
No matter whom it is,

588
00:45:26,787 --> 00:45:30,387
that person will have the money and power of Soonyang too.

589
00:45:32,927 --> 00:45:34,657
The police investigation was stopped,

590
00:45:34,657 --> 00:45:37,837
but General Manager Woo Byeong Jun has been searching.

591
00:45:37,837 --> 00:45:42,798
It won't take long to find those who planned or abetted this accident.

592
00:45:43,437 --> 00:45:47,307
So please let Grandfather have his way, Mother.

593
00:45:47,307 --> 00:45:53,208
Your grandfather is the scariest of them all and is not trustworthy.

594
00:45:55,608 --> 00:45:56,725
I know.

595
00:45:56,725 --> 00:46:03,364
But he needs me the most at this point, Mother.

596
00:46:03,364 --> 00:46:10,018
You know that Grandfather uses any ways and means to get what he wants.

597
00:46:11,598 --> 00:46:17,468
He'll do his best to keep me safe.

598
00:46:21,907 --> 00:46:26,978
Just as Do Jun says, let's give him our trust this time.

599
00:46:34,487 --> 00:46:38,817
I should at least request more bodyguards.

600
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:44,585
You should go, Father.

601
00:47:03,648 --> 00:47:05,417
Hyeong Jun.

602
00:47:07,455 --> 00:47:10,896
Mom and Dad are gone. You should go.

603
00:47:10,896 --> 00:47:13,328
I'm here as your caregiver.

604
00:47:13,328 --> 00:47:15,657
Don't mind me.

605
00:47:15,657 --> 00:47:18,657
I'm fine. I'm not hurt in any way.

606
00:47:18,657 --> 00:47:21,027
I'm not fine.

607
00:47:21,027 --> 00:47:22,897
I'm in pain.

608
00:47:22,897 --> 00:47:24,637
What?

609
00:47:27,237 --> 00:47:29,608
You really can't take a hint.

610
00:47:29,608 --> 00:47:34,348
And you really don't care about your brother.

611
00:47:35,418 --> 00:47:37,947
My album fell through.

612
00:47:37,947 --> 00:47:39,947
Why?

613
00:47:39,947 --> 00:47:41,387
Did something happen?

614
00:47:41,387 --> 00:47:46,488
As you can see from looking at my face, I'm a singer with good looks,

615
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:49,597
but another singer made his debut with the same image.

616
00:47:49,597 --> 00:47:51,698
He preempted my market.

617
00:47:51,698 --> 00:47:57,327
Because of him, I've totally become a bust.

618
00:47:57,967 --> 00:48:00,567
Gosh. Look at that.

619
00:48:01,637 --> 00:48:06,137
That was a charming performance.

620
00:48:11,277 --> 00:48:13,148
- Jin Do Jun. 
 - Yes?

621
00:48:13,148 --> 00:48:15,288
Come here.

622
00:48:15,288 --> 00:48:18,858
- Why? 
 - Because your brother said so.

623
00:48:20,987 --> 00:48:22,527
Yes, Sir.

624
00:48:28,268 --> 00:48:30,998
Do Jun, I'll continue to do music.

625
00:48:30,998 --> 00:48:34,168
So I'll make a fortune, too.

626
00:48:34,168 --> 00:48:35,438
Okay.

627
00:48:35,438 --> 00:48:39,937
You can have all of my money.

628
00:48:39,937 --> 00:48:41,347
What?

629
00:48:42,648 --> 00:48:47,288
Later, much later,

630
00:48:47,288 --> 00:48:50,758
when Mom and Dad leave us their inheritance,

631
00:48:50,758 --> 00:48:55,328
you can have everything, too.

632
00:48:58,598 --> 00:49:03,298
Let's not live in torment over some money.

633
00:49:04,668 --> 00:49:09,068
You can have all of my money.

634
00:49:12,107 --> 00:49:13,777
Hyeong Jun.

635
00:49:18,148 --> 00:49:25,047
So you have to give me all your money, too.

636
00:49:31,898 --> 00:49:33,268
- Let go. 
 - I can't.

637
00:49:33,268 --> 00:49:35,327
- Let go of my hand. 
 - I can't let go of your hand.

638
00:49:35,327 --> 00:49:38,268
Just take this orange.

639
00:49:38,268 --> 00:49:40,443
I thought you were cool for once.

640
00:49:45,207 --> 00:49:47,208
   

641
00:50:04,027 --> 00:50:05,858
I found it.

642
00:50:10,838 --> 00:50:12,718
   

643
00:50:14,237 --> 00:50:19,937
I looked up the bank statement of the truck driver for the past year.

644
00:50:20,978 --> 00:50:22,447
It's just as we expected.

645
00:50:22,447 --> 00:50:28,148
He didn't receive a huge amount through his bank, or anything else in particular.

646
00:50:28,148 --> 00:50:32,788
Even if the instigator paid him, I'm sure it was in cash.

647
00:50:33,728 --> 00:50:35,458
What about the call history?

648
00:50:35,458 --> 00:50:38,298
 The frequency of the last number he called on the day  

649
00:50:38,298 --> 00:50:41,409
of the accident sharply rose in the past month.

650
00:50:41,409 --> 00:50:43,625
I have investigated that as well.

651
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:45,907
It was a burner phone.

652
00:50:45,907 --> 00:50:50,337
I also found out that the truck driver was an ex-convict.

653
00:50:50,337 --> 00:50:52,137
He was charged for gambling.

654
00:50:52,137 --> 00:50:54,947
   

655
00:50:57,518 --> 00:51:00,587
   

656
00:51:09,957 --> 00:51:11,558
   

657
00:51:11,558 --> 00:51:13,368
   

658
00:51:13,368 --> 00:51:16,228
   

659
00:51:17,697 --> 00:51:19,998
Do you recognize him?

660
00:51:19,998 --> 00:51:23,007
I've only seen him around here.

661
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:25,377
You shouldn't ask me.

662
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,348
Oh, there he is.

663
00:51:28,348 --> 00:51:30,517
He was close to that customer.

664
00:51:31,748 --> 00:51:34,047
Yes, thank you.

665
00:51:42,157 --> 00:51:44,427
Yoon Ki is

666
00:51:44,427 --> 00:51:48,697
already pretending like he's an abdicated king who put his son on the throne.

667
00:51:49,537 --> 00:51:51,338
You should've seen him, Oppa Young Ki.

668
00:51:51,338 --> 00:51:54,708
Then you'll probably put a halt on the board meeting

669
00:51:54,708 --> 00:51:57,938
and the financial holding company.

670
00:51:57,938 --> 00:52:00,608
He can't even hold to what he has.

671
00:52:00,608 --> 00:52:03,007
He doesn't have enough power.

672
00:52:10,618 --> 00:52:12,357
Well...

673
00:52:13,387 --> 00:52:16,997
Do you still feel sour about it?

674
00:52:16,997 --> 00:52:19,568
I'm very disappointed, too.

675
00:52:19,568 --> 00:52:22,598
I didn't bring that up just to benefit myself.

676
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:24,337
What?

677
00:52:25,237 --> 00:52:26,968
I mean...

678
00:52:26,968 --> 00:52:28,807
No one else in the world may know,

679
00:52:28,807 --> 00:52:34,147
but the three of us, we three siblings know how cruel our father is.

680
00:52:34,907 --> 00:52:39,718
All our lives, he’s lined us up in front of him, evaluating us every single day.

681
00:52:39,718 --> 00:52:45,417
And he now wants to abandon us and go with Do Jun?

682
00:52:45,417 --> 00:52:50,927
Why should we put in hard work to give a feast to a stray dog like him?

683
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,827
You must call off the board meeting first.

684
00:52:54,827 --> 00:52:58,668
It's a great chance. We can use Father's illness as an excuse.

685
00:52:58,668 --> 00:53:03,168
He'll stop talking about the financial holding company in just three months.

686
00:53:03,168 --> 00:53:06,578
What if Father wakes up?

687
00:53:08,108 --> 00:53:12,518
Do you think he'll forgive the three of us for the coup?

688
00:53:16,487 --> 00:53:19,757
We'll hold the board meeting as planned.

689
00:53:20,695 --> 00:53:25,788
And we'll put mercenaries in the front of our coup.

690
00:53:25,788 --> 00:53:27,527
Mercenaries?

691
00:53:32,097 --> 00:53:35,537
They're holding the board meeting as planned.

692
00:53:35,537 --> 00:53:37,137
- Really? 
 - Yes.

693
00:53:37,137 --> 00:53:41,308
They'll hold the meeting, but they will tamper with the votes of the directors

694
00:53:41,308 --> 00:53:43,854
to abort the attempt of building the financial holding company.

695
00:53:43,854 --> 00:53:48,847
They must feel a burden to be seen opposing your will.

696
00:53:48,847 --> 00:53:51,717
They aren't completely dull.

697
00:53:51,717 --> 00:53:55,558
It won't be easy to humor the directors for the next few days.

698
00:53:55,558 --> 00:53:57,196
But bad news.

699
00:53:57,196 --> 00:53:58,728
Once I show up

700
00:53:58,728 --> 00:54:02,398
at the board meeting, their votes are all mine.

701
00:54:03,598 --> 00:54:05,537
Once the holding company's plan passes the board meeting,

702
00:54:05,537 --> 00:54:10,537
we'll then vote to place Do Jun as a CEO candidate.

703
00:54:10,537 --> 00:54:15,307
This time, I will cast my vote on you, Mr. Lee.

704
00:54:17,878 --> 00:54:19,347
Don't worry.

705
00:54:19,347 --> 00:54:23,387
We always place an impossible candidate for the sake of the board meeting.

706
00:54:23,387 --> 00:54:26,427
That way, it won't be confusing for the shareholders

707
00:54:26,427 --> 00:54:29,558
as the management cast an overwhelming amount of votes, for a candidate they want.

708
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:31,398
Is that right?

709
00:54:33,926 --> 00:54:38,071
So that's all settled. Be prepared for the board meeting.

710
00:54:38,071 --> 00:54:38,839
Yes.

711
00:54:38,839 --> 00:54:42,507
We should buy him a new suit to make him look sharp.

712
00:54:42,507 --> 00:54:43,838
Yes, Sir.

713
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:46,448
I'm fine, Grandfather. Maybe next time.

714
00:54:46,448 --> 00:54:50,277
Next time? When?

715
00:54:51,078 --> 00:54:53,987
You can try to live until you're 100.

716
00:54:53,987 --> 00:54:56,107
But that "next time" never comes.

717
00:54:57,987 --> 00:55:00,858
Why isn't Mr. Woo coming back with any news?

718
00:55:00,858 --> 00:55:03,727
I'll contact him.

719
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:10,038
Please have this as we talk.

720
00:55:10,038 --> 00:55:11,767
Sure.

721
00:55:13,444 --> 00:55:15,779
It looked like he was in debt.

722
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:18,307
Did he tell anyone that he needed money?

723
00:55:18,307 --> 00:55:20,308
I need money, too.

724
00:55:20,308 --> 00:55:22,768
Is there anyone who doesn't need money?

725
00:55:22,768 --> 00:55:26,787
It's a rule for gamblers never to deal with money.

726
00:55:26,787 --> 00:55:28,318
Let me ask you, too.

727
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:31,057
The police put an end to this investigation already.

728
00:55:31,057 --> 00:55:32,528
Why is Soonyang snooping around?

729
00:55:32,528 --> 00:55:35,257
This accident concerns an employee of Soonyang.

730
00:55:35,257 --> 00:55:38,597
I need to put together a report for the higher-ups.

731
00:55:38,597 --> 00:55:40,467
It must be tough for you.

732
00:55:40,467 --> 00:55:44,538
And it must've been even harder without any CCTV on the site.

733
00:55:45,398 --> 00:55:49,838
If you don't have more questions, may I go now?

734
00:55:49,838 --> 00:55:53,138
- Thank you for cooperating. 
 - Sure.

735
00:56:07,928 --> 00:56:09,828
   

736
00:56:09,828 --> 00:56:10,898
Hey, move quickly.

737
00:56:10,898 --> 00:56:12,228
We're closing the office as of today.

738
00:56:12,228 --> 00:56:15,568
You're all on a break until you get further notice. Move!

739
00:56:29,618 --> 00:56:30,878
Who are you?

740
00:56:30,878 --> 00:56:33,348
Who are you people?

741
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:36,217
The accident on the outer road of Incheon.

742
00:56:36,217 --> 00:56:40,458
Did you plan and abet the accident in this office?

743
00:56:40,458 --> 00:56:41,628
What is this nonsense...

744
00:56:41,628 --> 00:56:45,328
You knew there were no CCTVs on the site of the accident.

745
00:56:45,328 --> 00:56:50,568
An ordinary intersection in Korea would have a CCTV in that region,

746
00:56:50,568 --> 00:56:55,637
but a civil servant made a mistake and left it out as an exception.

747
00:56:55,637 --> 00:56:58,338
If you're aware of that, you're either with the police,

748
00:56:58,338 --> 00:57:01,878
or the person who planned the accident.

749
00:57:03,578 --> 00:57:06,748
Who's behind you?

750
00:57:09,617 --> 00:57:13,217
How did he meet with the instigator of the accident?

751
00:57:19,357 --> 00:57:24,168
 He was given instructions and paid by using coin lockers. 

752
00:57:35,377 --> 00:57:37,418
There are no traces of transactions for antique artworks.

753
00:57:37,418 --> 00:57:40,188
It's impossible to track the origin of the fund.

754
00:57:40,188 --> 00:57:42,118
Whoever this is

755
00:57:42,118 --> 00:57:48,087
has a knack for hiding the source of the fund.

756
00:58:05,077 --> 00:58:06,954
I never imagined I would face a day

757
00:58:06,954 --> 00:58:11,555
to have you at my gallery, Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong.

758
00:58:13,717 --> 00:58:16,688
This is interesting.

759
00:58:16,688 --> 00:58:19,958
Nobody used to pay any attention to folk paintings like these,

760
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:26,628
but they rose to value like this thanks to you, CEO Mo, a savvy investor.

761
00:58:35,737 --> 00:58:38,957
I hear you're highly interested in paintings with flowers and birds.

762
00:58:43,918 --> 00:58:47,717
This is one of your collections, right?

763
00:58:47,717 --> 00:58:49,248
A painting of flowers and birds is made

764
00:58:49,248 --> 00:58:54,962
hoping that the flowers and birds will bring the family longevity, blessings, and love.

765
00:58:54,962 --> 00:58:58,298
I especially loved the bold colors,

766
00:58:58,298 --> 00:59:03,628
and lively theme for this painting, so this is my most cherished possession.

767
00:59:05,367 --> 00:59:10,207
If this is the gallery's collection, it must be in the storage.

768
00:59:10,978 --> 00:59:12,338
What is it?

769
00:59:12,338 --> 00:59:15,678
I came upon a situation that this painting

770
00:59:15,678 --> 00:59:18,447
could have been used for an illegal transaction.

771
00:59:18,447 --> 00:59:19,918
An illegal transaction?

772
00:59:19,918 --> 00:59:22,987
I received a report that murder instigators,

773
00:59:22,987 --> 00:59:27,657
who disguised it as a car accident, paid the price with this painting.

774
00:59:29,287 --> 00:59:33,728
May I check and see if this painting is here?

775
00:59:35,528 --> 00:59:38,097
It's not here.

776
00:59:38,097 --> 00:59:42,067
It was stolen a month ago.

777
00:59:44,481 --> 00:59:48,385
Then why didn't you tell me about the theft first?

778
00:59:48,385 --> 00:59:51,748
If a collection was stolen from this gallery,

779
00:59:51,748 --> 00:59:55,217
would you be able to trust it?

780
01:00:03,898 --> 01:00:06,438
You got here earlier than I thought.

781
01:00:08,697 --> 01:00:14,598
I sent all the paintings to the directors who are expected at the board meeting.

782
01:00:14,598 --> 01:00:19,538
I carefully picked out undisclosed works of well-known artists.

783
01:00:19,538 --> 01:00:24,077
They have money, and friends to show it off to,

784
01:00:24,077 --> 01:00:27,526
but they're at an age without any taste to parade.

785
01:00:27,526 --> 01:00:31,126
Do people really like receiving these paintings?

786
01:00:34,257 --> 01:00:37,805
It can always be turned into money,

787
01:00:37,805 --> 01:00:43,005
but they can forget the guilt of receiving a bribe.

788
01:00:45,737 --> 01:00:49,837
Money is the only thing that is aesthetically perfect.

789
01:00:49,837 --> 01:00:51,338
What?

790
01:00:52,637 --> 01:00:55,508
It's something a professor said during a class in college.

791
01:00:55,508 --> 01:01:00,248
In the end, there's only one thing that is aesthetically perfect.

792
01:01:00,248 --> 01:01:02,625
Money.

793
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:04,657
It's only money.

794
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:07,628
It's a good quote.

795
01:01:07,628 --> 01:01:10,704
Although it must've been tough to agree with as a college student.

796
01:01:10,704 --> 01:01:13,398
Understanding Classical English and American Literature, C minus.

797
01:01:13,398 --> 01:01:18,867
On the day we first met at the airport, it was that grade you ridiculed me for.

798
01:01:20,237 --> 01:01:25,879
A long leather coat, a leopard-print hat, wearing red lipstick.

799
01:01:25,879 --> 01:01:31,907
You picked out clothes that don't suit you on purpose, hoping I would turn you down first.

800
01:01:31,907 --> 01:01:34,518
You remember everything?

801
01:01:36,556 --> 01:01:39,557
You stood before me with a face that says,

802
01:01:39,557 --> 01:01:42,304
"I was never turned down by anybody."

803
01:01:43,027 --> 01:01:47,297
I could tell by your eyes that you never made an effort

804
01:01:47,297 --> 01:01:50,398
to be liked by anybody, and you'll never do so.

805
01:01:51,737 --> 01:01:56,067
I thought you were interesting, but no.

806
01:01:57,378 --> 01:01:59,478
I was envious.

807
01:02:00,577 --> 01:02:03,348
You were envious of that?

808
01:02:03,348 --> 01:02:07,317
There's nothing much to the grandson of Soonyang's chairman.

809
01:02:07,317 --> 01:02:10,387
Our children will be fine.

810
01:02:11,418 --> 01:02:15,628
In the future, someday,

811
01:02:15,628 --> 01:02:18,357
you, me, and our children.

812
01:02:23,898 --> 01:02:28,137
They won't have to grow up with such a big-name grandfather.

813
01:02:29,237 --> 01:02:33,378
Then they won't have to be conscious twice as much for their father.

814
01:02:36,617 --> 01:02:40,618
I wanted to tell you this after returning to the headquarters.

815
01:02:42,817 --> 01:02:45,958
Okay. I'll go now.

816
01:02:51,298 --> 01:02:54,397
Who did you give it to?

817
01:03:00,367 --> 01:03:02,227
The flower and bird painting.

818
01:03:04,307 --> 01:03:08,278
The famous folk painting of my gallery's collection.

819
01:03:09,608 --> 01:03:11,817
Why do you ask?

820
01:03:11,817 --> 01:03:12,919
Just because.

821
01:03:12,919 --> 01:03:17,987
This was the first time you took a painting without running it by me.

822
01:03:19,688 --> 01:03:24,731
Who did you give the flower and bird painting to?

823
01:03:31,967 --> 01:03:40,538
Does this mean CEO Jin Seong Jun is behind this accident?

824
01:03:40,538 --> 01:03:43,217
What I can tell you now is...

825
01:03:43,217 --> 01:03:46,648
that the culprits of the accident received it like a postdated check.

826
01:03:46,648 --> 01:03:48,348
Also,

827
01:03:49,248 --> 01:03:55,128
that the owner of this painting is CEO Mo Hyeon Min.

828
01:03:59,228 --> 01:04:07,128
So who made an attempt to kill me?

829
01:04:11,478 --> 01:04:13,338
Chairman Jin.

830
01:04:21,248 --> 01:04:23,947
I'm scared.

831
01:04:26,557 --> 01:04:28,357
Why?

832
01:04:29,128 --> 01:04:34,128
Why are they trying to kill me?

833
01:04:38,237 --> 01:04:39,997
Grandfather.

834
01:04:39,997 --> 01:04:42,308
Are you all right?

835
01:04:43,278 --> 01:04:46,277
Who... Who are you?

836
01:04:50,378 --> 01:04:52,318
Mr. Lee.

837
01:04:53,418 --> 01:04:55,347
Do you know him?

838
01:04:55,347 --> 01:04:57,117
He's Do Jun, Chairman Jin.

839
01:04:57,117 --> 01:04:58,517
Your youngest grandson.

840
01:04:58,517 --> 01:05:00,957
No, he's not.

841
01:05:00,957 --> 01:05:02,503
No.

842
01:05:02,503 --> 01:05:08,744
Not him. He's the frightening kid who's trying to kill me!

843
01:05:11,237 --> 01:05:13,537
Go!

844
01:05:13,537 --> 01:05:15,437
Get out!

845
01:05:19,677 --> 01:05:22,578
Get out of here!

846
01:05:22,578 --> 01:05:25,548
Get out! Go!

847
01:05:26,478 --> 01:05:32,370
   

848
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:36,700
♫  I am falling into a deeper place  ♫

849
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:41,880
♫  I’m afraid I won’t be able  ♫

850
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:46,070
♫  to return to my rightful place anymore  ♫

851
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:49,450
♫   In the end  ♫

852
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:55,760
♫   I can't breathe, no, I can't breathe  ♫

853
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:58,960
♫   In the end  ♫

854
01:06:00,610 --> 01:06:03,818
 His brain is in general malfunction, a delirium.   
  ♫   let me live, please let me live  ♫

855
01:06:03,818 --> 01:06:06,287
 I am Jin Yang Cheol! 

856
01:06:06,287 --> 01:06:08,928
 Are you going to a board meeting at nine o'clock at night? 

857
01:06:08,928 --> 01:06:13,398
 If your delirium kicks in during the board meeting, you'll have to step down as the chairman too. 

858
01:06:13,398 --> 01:06:14,827
 Was his name Jin Seong Jun? 

859
01:06:14,827 --> 01:06:18,798
 Fellow Korean Lad, there is no way you will win the votes by number. 

860
01:06:18,798 --> 01:06:22,607
 I agreed to forming a holding company, yet I dragged you down from the CEO's position. 

861
01:06:22,607 --> 01:06:24,477
 Does this make me the culprit or not? 

862
01:06:24,477 --> 01:06:28,137
 Who is it? Who tried to kill me? 

863
01:06:28,137 --> 01:06:31,878
 Can we really call Grandfather the same Chairman Jin Yang Cheol? 

864
01:06:31,878 --> 01:06:35,048
 He's not in his right mind. 

865
01:06:35,048 --> 01:06:37,787
 I won't ask you to keep me alive. 

866
01:06:37,787 --> 01:06:42,510
 Two hours. Just for two hours. 

867
01:06:42,510 --> 01:06:48,010
 Let me live as myself, as Jin Yang Cheol. 

868
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:53,390
♫  Oh, get me out of here, save me. ♫

869
01:06:53,390 --> 01:06:56,820
