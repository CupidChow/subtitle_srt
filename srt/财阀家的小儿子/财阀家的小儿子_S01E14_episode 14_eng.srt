1
00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:02,572
   

2
00:00:02,572 --> 00:00:08,103
Do Jun told me to drop you off safe and sound.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:14,930


4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:15,830
   

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,282
When you get there,

6
00:00:17,282 --> 00:00:21,353
you'll see Do Jun's employees from Miracle waiting for you.

7
00:00:22,053 --> 00:00:26,223
I guess you'll be away for quite a while.

8
00:00:27,323 --> 00:00:30,992
No one at Jeongsimjae seemed to know about it.

9
00:00:30,992 --> 00:00:33,763
Why didn't you tell them?

10
00:00:35,463 --> 00:00:40,273
Do Jun told me everything.

11
00:00:45,073 --> 00:00:47,083
Mother, I have to say,

12
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:49,613
you are a scary person.

13
00:00:51,582 --> 00:00:57,282
Your Soonyang Insurance shares, I heard you handed them over to Do Jun.

14
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:04,192
From the day my birth mother brought me to Jeongsimjae to this very moment,

15
00:01:04,192 --> 00:01:05,993
I have always

16
00:01:07,103 --> 00:01:12,133
felt uncomfortable around you and found you inaccessible.

17
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:13,903
You see,

18
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:18,642
I've done my very best to take good care of you.

19
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:21,983
I treated you just like I treated my own children.

20
00:01:21,983 --> 00:01:26,152
I always bought you nice clothes and fed you good food.

21
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:29,352
But with your eyes, you always told me this.

22
00:01:29,352 --> 00:01:33,292
"If you have a conscience, you should not forget my kindness."

23
00:01:33,292 --> 00:01:37,932
"So don't you dare dream of succeeding the throne at Soonyang."

24
00:01:38,792 --> 00:01:40,862
All my life,

25
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:45,133
I've lived as if I was protesting against you, Mother.

26
00:01:46,472 --> 00:01:50,242
Going against Father's wishes and studying films.

27
00:01:50,242 --> 00:01:54,743
Marrying someone you and Father disapproved of. All of it.

28
00:01:56,013 --> 00:01:57,853
But it turns out,

29
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,583
I'm even worse than you.

30
00:02:04,222 --> 00:02:08,962
The cruel bunch who can do anything for their children.

31
00:02:10,662 --> 00:02:14,262
I suppose all parents are like that after all, Mother.

32
00:02:16,173 --> 00:02:19,333
Now that I've become one of such parents,

33
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:23,373
I can finally understand

34
00:02:25,542 --> 00:02:29,912
how hurt you must've been by my existence

35
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:35,123
in and of itself, every single moment.

36
00:02:39,252 --> 00:02:44,322
Mother, I respect you for enduring it all through these years.

37
00:03:15,023 --> 00:03:15,924
   

38
00:03:15,924 --> 00:03:17,692
Regarding Lee Pil Ok's borrowed-name account,

39
00:03:17,692 --> 00:03:21,162
we found out that there was a large transaction recently.

40
00:03:21,162 --> 00:03:24,572
The Soonyang Insurance shares she had purchased...

41
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:25,873
   

42
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:29,603
Here. She's transferred them to Jin Do Jun.

43
00:03:29,603 --> 00:03:33,082
   
   

44
00:03:35,743 --> 00:03:37,212
Ma'am.

45
00:03:37,212 --> 00:03:39,183
Lee Pil Ok isn't in the country.

46
00:03:39,183 --> 00:03:41,683
- What? 
 - She already left the country.

47
00:03:41,683 --> 00:03:44,533
I confirmed it with Immigration just now.

48
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,080
   
   

49
00:03:51,793 --> 00:03:53,602
   

50
00:04:02,072 --> 00:04:03,772
It was you, wasn't it?

51
00:04:05,642 --> 00:04:08,012
Your grandmother.

52
00:04:08,012 --> 00:04:10,612
Lee Pil Ok, the prime suspect in the proxy murder case.

53
00:04:10,612 --> 00:04:12,812
You helped her flee the country.

54
00:04:16,152 --> 00:04:18,252
Did you cut a deal with her?

55
00:04:18,952 --> 00:04:21,702
Because of her Soonyang Insurance shares?

56
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:31,562
I tried so hard to catch her, yet you cut a deal with her.

57
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,073
You, of all people,

58
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,723
know why I wanted to catch her so much.

59
00:04:38,173 --> 00:04:40,523
You've got nothing to say, right?

60
00:04:46,683 --> 00:04:49,382
Just this once. We're almost there, Min Yeong.

61
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:51,322
It'll all be over once I'm appointed CEO at the shareholders' meeting.

62
00:04:51,322 --> 00:04:53,963
I won't let you down anymore.

63
00:04:55,623 --> 00:04:57,232
You're wrong.

64
00:04:58,332 --> 00:05:00,782
You'll become even more dishonorable.

65
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,152
Because you'll want to keep your position.

66
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:33,132
Honey,

67
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:38,273
you said you wanted to live like Grandmother from now on.

68
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:43,973
You knew everything about her, but you still said that to me.

69
00:05:47,082 --> 00:05:48,882
What did you mean by that?

70
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:51,482
Are you going to kill me or something?

71
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,622
There's no reason I couldn't.

72
00:06:07,002 --> 00:06:08,903
If you

73
00:06:10,473 --> 00:06:15,303
get in the way of that baby becoming the owner of Soonyang, that is.

74
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,943
I don't care who it is.

75
00:06:18,943 --> 00:06:21,242
I can do anything.

76
00:06:22,812 --> 00:06:25,012
Just like your grandmother.

77
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:33,123
So you'd better get your act together.

78
00:06:33,863 --> 00:06:35,762
It starts with you.

79
00:07:07,062 --> 00:07:09,063
Are you anxious?

80
00:07:10,632 --> 00:07:13,562
Since we're going all in,

81
00:07:14,632 --> 00:07:18,033
one ace card won't do.

82
00:07:21,243 --> 00:07:22,843
Then what?

83
00:07:24,613 --> 00:07:26,542
Don't worry.

84
00:07:27,343 --> 00:07:30,483
I'm holding the joker in this round.

85
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,863
   

86
00:07:39,863 --> 00:07:41,823
   

87
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,993
   

88
00:07:42,993 --> 00:07:48,062
Next, we'll discuss the appointment of the CEO of Soonyang Financial Holding Company.

89
00:07:48,062 --> 00:07:53,373
The board of directors recommended Director Lee Hang Jae.

90
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:56,192
   

91
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:02,383
Board member Jin Do Jun is another candidate.

92
00:08:10,252 --> 00:08:14,393
All right. We'll vote to decide.

93
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,063
Is everyone ready?

94
00:08:19,562 --> 00:08:22,263
He used violence against Chairman Jin in the hospital room?

95
00:08:22,263 --> 00:08:25,613
Was it the shock that killed him? 
    

96
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:30,843
This certainly disqualifies Jin Do Jun for the position.

97
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,542
Are these texts really true?

98
00:08:33,542 --> 00:08:35,143
We demand an explanation.

99
00:08:35,143 --> 00:08:38,283
- Explain this. 
 - Everyone, let's not vote.

100
00:08:41,753 --> 00:08:44,722
To bring order back to this room so that we can proceed,

101
00:08:44,722 --> 00:08:47,822
I hereby exercise my authority as the chairperson

102
00:08:47,822 --> 00:08:51,332
and ask Director Jin Do Jun to provide an explanation.

103
00:08:52,063 --> 00:08:55,502
Is the content of the text message true?

104
00:08:57,772 --> 00:08:59,533
It is not true.

105
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:02,172
We don't believe him. Can he prove it with evidence?

106
00:09:02,172 --> 00:09:04,343
How are we supposed to believe him?

107
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:06,112
Quiet down, please.

108
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:11,482
Can you prove it?

109
00:09:20,262 --> 00:09:21,492
Yes.

110
00:09:21,492 --> 00:09:23,932
   

111
00:09:23,932 --> 00:09:25,393
Yes.

112
00:09:25,393 --> 00:09:29,862
There is one way Director Jin Do Jun can clear his name.

113
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:32,172
In the late chairman's room at the hospital,

114
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:35,003
there was a camera recording everything,

115
00:09:35,003 --> 00:09:38,343
which the hospital staff use to monitor their VIP patients.

116
00:09:38,343 --> 00:09:42,683
Why don't we check the footage here?

117
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,753
Good idea. Let's do that.

118
00:09:44,753 --> 00:09:46,703
Find the footage now.

119
00:09:48,953 --> 00:09:51,253
Please quiet down.

120
00:09:51,253 --> 00:09:53,153
Do you agree to this?

121
00:09:55,823 --> 00:09:57,663
Board member Jin Do Jun.

122
00:10:03,373 --> 00:10:07,402
That will be impossible.

123
00:10:08,473 --> 00:10:11,343
"Impossible?" What do you mean?

124
00:10:12,313 --> 00:10:15,542
The footage is gone.

125
00:10:17,753 --> 00:10:22,123
The board member Jin Do Jun here ordered me personally to get rid of it.

126
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:28,542
 Then I can do what I want with it with my authority, right? 

127
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:30,923
 Please delete the footage. 

128
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:48,743
If nothing bad had happened in the room that day,

129
00:10:48,743 --> 00:10:53,213
why would he have asked me to delete the footage?

130
00:10:59,152 --> 00:11:00,992
Please be quiet.

131
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:02,792
It is not true.

132
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:05,292
Please let me speak, Chairperson.

133
00:11:07,702 --> 00:11:10,973
All right, please quiet down. Let me clear this up.

134
00:11:10,973 --> 00:11:15,002
This is not a courtroom to prove innocence.

135
00:11:15,002 --> 00:11:17,942
However, the leader's sense or lack of morality

136
00:11:17,942 --> 00:11:21,512
could make or break the future of the company.

137
00:11:21,512 --> 00:11:25,082
The late chairman wished to choose a leader

138
00:11:25,082 --> 00:11:28,353
who could lead the right way.

139
00:11:28,353 --> 00:11:30,453
Take your time to think about who would be

140
00:11:30,453 --> 00:11:33,443
the best person for the role before you vote.

141
00:11:34,162 --> 00:11:36,023
All right, then.

142
00:11:36,023 --> 00:11:39,263
Let's begin.

143
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:41,762
 Mr. Chairman is 

144
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:46,902
 experiencing symptoms of delirium at the moment. 

145
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:54,713
 So? 

146
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:57,852
 Have you decided to join hands with me? 

147
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:06,193
 I am now too old and tired to keep on working as a mere farmer. 

148
00:12:12,292 --> 00:12:15,332
 Please give me some shares. 

149
00:12:16,032 --> 00:12:18,172
 I helped Soonyang grow to what it is today. 

150
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:22,422
 I wish to own a plot of land in the company, no matter how small it is. 

151
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:39,123
 That painting has surely found its place. 

152
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:46,593
 I suppose you liked my gift. 

153
00:12:56,143 --> 00:13:00,412
I will now announce the results. Director Lee Hang Jae

154
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:03,533
has been appointed CEO of Soonyang Financial Holding Company.

155
00:13:05,683 --> 00:13:08,633
   

156
00:13:12,723 --> 00:13:14,023
   

157
00:13:26,402 --> 00:13:29,202
Do Jun, have you thought about this?

158
00:13:30,672 --> 00:13:34,122
Would Chairman Jin Yang Cheol have told me

159
00:13:34,122 --> 00:13:37,283
to delete the security footage?

160
00:13:48,493 --> 00:13:52,263
So after all,

161
00:13:52,263 --> 00:13:55,203
we're the owners of Soonyang Financial Holding Company.

162
00:13:57,332 --> 00:13:59,332
Congratulations.

163
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,473
We jointly own thirty percent of the shares.

164
00:14:02,473 --> 00:14:06,072
Add the CEO's friendly stakes, then we're at 37 percent.

165
00:14:06,072 --> 00:14:09,542
Do Jun is no match for us now.

166
00:14:09,542 --> 00:14:11,752
We used Mr. Lee

167
00:14:11,752 --> 00:14:13,922
and labeled Do Jun as an immoral child

168
00:14:13,922 --> 00:14:17,322
in front of all the shareholders,

169
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:19,593
so he'll have to lie low for the time being.

170
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:25,892
We now have voting rights in all the subsidiaries under the holding company.

171
00:14:25,892 --> 00:14:29,802
My, this is nice. The holding company!

172
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:33,972
Right, as long as one of us doesn't betray the other.

173
00:14:34,603 --> 00:14:39,142
Hyung Young Ki, no one has our backs now.

174
00:14:39,142 --> 00:14:43,312
We only have each other under the sky.

175
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,752
Right?

176
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,572
Congratulations.

177
00:15:05,473 --> 00:15:07,503
Thank you.

178
00:15:09,102 --> 00:15:11,973
About the shares we discussed the other day...

179
00:15:11,973 --> 00:15:14,173
- Right. 
 - Yes.

180
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:24,422
   

181
00:15:25,552 --> 00:15:27,893
My grandfather thought it was just a borrowed-name account

182
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:31,292
in your name.

183
00:15:31,292 --> 00:15:35,462
But I suppose you thought the account was yours.

184
00:15:36,932 --> 00:15:41,332
I understand you get crumbs on your hands when handling bread.

185
00:15:41,332 --> 00:15:44,992
Just resign. I'll consider it your severance package.

186
00:15:46,743 --> 00:15:50,193
Or would you rather be on the news as an embezzler?

187
00:15:57,893 --> 00:16:02,463
Was this your plan from the start, from the moment

188
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:05,463
you offered me the CEO position?

189
00:16:05,463 --> 00:16:08,413
Did you just need a knife to get rid of Do Jun?

190
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:13,103
The family fighting during Grandfather's funeral wouldn't be a pretty sight.

191
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:22,982
   

192
00:16:28,953 --> 00:16:31,523
My whole life, I was completely dedicated to Soonyang.

193
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:35,292
I joined the company way before you were even born.

194
00:16:35,292 --> 00:16:38,833
Your grandfather and I grew Soonyang into what it is today.

195
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,833
So why...

196
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,533
Why should I be treated like this? Just why?

197
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,943
I apologize.

198
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:52,642
I guess you feel deeply wronged.

199
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:57,363
Are you that desperate to be treated like an owner?

200
00:17:10,832 --> 00:17:13,593
Then you should be born again.

201
00:17:37,153 --> 00:17:39,023
   

202
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:59,243
Grandfather truly is an interesting man.

203
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:03,812
He said he wanted you to be the CEO of the holding company.

204
00:18:03,812 --> 00:18:06,752
So what's with the will then?

205
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:09,952
I thought long and hard.

206
00:18:09,952 --> 00:18:14,553
If he was just joking, that's mean. And if it's a prank, that's cruel.

207
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:16,693
After long, careful consideration,

208
00:18:16,693 --> 00:18:19,332
I decided to step in as his eldest grandson.

209
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:21,602
I wanted to show you clearly in front of the shareholders

210
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:25,203
how Grandfather's will should be interpreted.

211
00:18:26,802 --> 00:18:29,603
Now, you're no match for us in this war.

212
00:18:29,603 --> 00:18:33,573
You cannot exercise any management or voting rights.

213
00:18:33,573 --> 00:18:37,842
Most importantly, you can no longer say

214
00:18:38,913 --> 00:18:42,313
that you're Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's favorite grandson.

215
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:48,023
There is only one thing you can do against Soonyang now.

216
00:18:48,023 --> 00:18:50,892
Hand over all your shares in the holding company to me.

217
00:18:50,892 --> 00:18:53,293
I'll pay a handsome price.

218
00:18:58,973 --> 00:19:02,473
Grandfather wrote in his will that you should

219
00:19:02,473 --> 00:19:05,692
live a life that has nothing to do with Soonyang.

220
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,212
How about you honor his last wishes?

221
00:19:09,212 --> 00:19:11,882
As a dutiful grandson should.

222
00:19:16,852 --> 00:19:19,392
You seem quite confident.

223
00:19:21,392 --> 00:19:24,992
I've been racking my brain but still can't figure out

224
00:19:24,992 --> 00:19:29,432
what Grandfather really meant by what he wrote in his will.

225
00:19:38,403 --> 00:19:40,543
This one thing I know.

226
00:19:42,743 --> 00:19:45,383
If Grandfather was in my situation now,

227
00:19:46,153 --> 00:19:48,803
I know what kind of choice he would make.

228
00:19:57,393 --> 00:20:00,663
My dear fellow members of the National Assembly. 
    

229
00:20:00,663 --> 00:20:02,903
Vote against the bill to ease the Separation

230
00:20:02,903 --> 00:20:04,073
of Banking and Commerce Act.

231
00:20:04,073 --> 00:20:05,532
   

232
00:20:05,532 --> 00:20:08,243
Put a stop to Soonyang's plan to establish

233
00:20:08,243 --> 00:20:10,743
a financial holding company.

234
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,642
This bill was devised to justify

235
00:20:12,642 --> 00:20:17,583
Soonyang's succession plans that seek to avoid the legal responsibilities that come with it.

236
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,182
The conglomerates are trying to push the bill through

237
00:20:20,182 --> 00:20:23,753
in order to avoid the astronomical inheritance taxes.

238
00:20:23,753 --> 00:20:26,953
We need systems and rules in place

239
00:20:26,953 --> 00:20:29,163
to keep the conglomerates in check

240
00:20:29,163 --> 00:20:31,063
in order to alleviate economic polarization

241
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:35,593
so that we can build a world where the economically weak can coexist with them.

242
00:20:35,593 --> 00:20:38,183
   

243
00:20:38,183 --> 00:20:40,433
I, Choi Chang Je,

244
00:20:40,433 --> 00:20:42,503
promise you that I will open the threshold

245
00:20:42,503 --> 00:20:44,942
through economic democratization!

246
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:47,813
 Earlier today, Mayor Choi Chang Je held a press conference, 

247
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,742
 where he stated he was against the bill 

248
00:20:49,742 --> 00:20:50,852
 to mitigate the Financial and Industrial Separation Act, 

249
00:20:50,852 --> 00:20:52,182
 as it'd create legal loopholes for Soonyang 

250
00:20:52,182 --> 00:20:53,982
 prior to announcing he was running for President. 

251
00:20:53,982 --> 00:20:57,152
 He stated that the late chairman, Jin Yang Cheol, 

252
00:20:57,152 --> 00:20:59,990
 pushed for the establishment of the financial holding company 
   

253
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,363
 to avoid having to pay astronomical inheritance taxes. 

254
00:21:02,363 --> 00:21:04,293
 Some suspect that the company might have taken 

255
00:21:04,293 --> 00:21:07,232
 expedient measures to establish its financial holding company. 

256
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:08,932
 There are growing suspicions surrounding 

257
00:21:08,932 --> 00:21:10,573
 potential corrupt practices within Soonyang. 

258
00:21:10,573 --> 00:21:12,132
 The National Assembly has voted against the bill 

259
00:21:12,132 --> 00:21:14,343
 to mitigate the Financial and Industrial Separation Act, 

260
00:21:14,343 --> 00:21:16,543
 so the establishment of Soonyang Financial Holding Company 

261
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:19,242
 is nullified. 

262
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:22,213
If our plans for the holding company fall through,

263
00:21:22,213 --> 00:21:24,212
what should we take care of first?

264
00:21:24,212 --> 00:21:26,553
We could've avoided at least a trillion won  ($1B) 

265
00:21:26,553 --> 00:21:28,652
in inheritance taxes by using the shares.

266
00:21:28,652 --> 00:21:30,123
As soon as the market opens tomorrow,

267
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:32,453
all the stocks connected to the holding company will plummet.

268
00:21:32,453 --> 00:21:34,993
Soonyang Insurance will probably drop to below 70k won  ($70) per share. 

269
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:37,733
The moment they vote against the bill,

270
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:40,193
we'll lose four trillion won  ($4B) in cash. 

271
00:21:40,193 --> 00:21:43,203
Darn it! They say you should never trust your brother-in-law.

272
00:21:43,203 --> 00:21:47,732
Why is Chang Je suddenly out to get us?

273
00:21:50,572 --> 00:21:54,313
Shouldn't you know him better by now?

274
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,913
Do you really think

275
00:21:55,913 --> 00:21:58,913
that Chang Je came up with this plan?

276
00:21:58,913 --> 00:22:00,853
Do you all think that?

277
00:22:02,753 --> 00:22:04,823
   

278
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,222
Hey, Nephew. People now call me

279
00:22:07,222 --> 00:22:10,192
the icon of economic democratization.

280
00:22:10,192 --> 00:22:12,263
They say, with just a few words, I managed to persuade them

281
00:22:12,263 --> 00:22:15,902
to vote against the bill that was about to pass easily.

282
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:18,872
 Anyway, how did you come up with an idea like this? 

283
00:22:18,872 --> 00:22:23,203
 So you used people's anger toward Chairman Jin Yang Cheol 

284
00:22:23,203 --> 00:22:25,212
 as an impetus 

285
00:22:25,212 --> 00:22:27,872
 to unite public opinion. 

286
00:22:27,872 --> 00:22:30,943
People do like heroes,

287
00:22:30,943 --> 00:22:33,282
but they get a real kick out of watching a hero fall.

288
00:22:33,282 --> 00:22:34,822
That's right.

289
00:22:34,822 --> 00:22:36,782
But no one would ever imagine

290
00:22:36,782 --> 00:22:39,193
that the person who made the hero fall

291
00:22:39,193 --> 00:22:44,033
was none other than his favorite grandson.

292
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:45,793
Right?

293
00:22:45,793 --> 00:22:48,203
 Oh, the party leader is here. 

294
00:22:48,203 --> 00:22:50,053
 I'll talk to you later. 

295
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:06,083
 Next news. The news that Soonyang Financial Holding Company, 

296
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,623
 Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's long-cherished ambition, 

297
00:23:07,623 --> 00:23:11,253
 was actually a part of the company's plan to avoid inheritance taxes 

298
00:23:11,253 --> 00:23:16,623
 is quickly making the countless mourners across the country turn away. 

299
00:23:16,623 --> 00:23:19,763
 No one can deny that the late chairman, Jin Yang Cheol, 

300
00:23:19,763 --> 00:23:21,663
 was a successful business leader. 

301
00:23:21,663 --> 00:23:23,973
 However, we also cannot deny that he tried 

302
00:23:23,973 --> 00:23:26,203
 to influence politicians until his final moments 

303
00:23:26,203 --> 00:23:31,942
 to illegally transfer his assets and take expedient measures to avoid inheritance taxes. 

304
00:23:31,942 --> 00:23:35,912
   

305
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:43,823
   

306
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,992
   

307
00:24:07,142 --> 00:24:11,812
 Lawyer Park, I want to change my will. 

308
00:24:11,812 --> 00:24:14,082
 It's all because of that rascal, Do Jun. 

309
00:24:15,283 --> 00:24:18,923
 He's no good! 

310
00:24:18,923 --> 00:24:22,763
 That rascal. I can't stand him. 

311
00:24:22,763 --> 00:24:26,463
 That's why I want to change my will. 

312
00:24:26,463 --> 00:24:29,363
 Why are you so unsatisfied with Do Jun, Mr. Chairman? 

313
00:24:29,363 --> 00:24:31,572
 Do you know why that punk 

314
00:24:31,572 --> 00:24:35,072
 is trying so hard to save Soonyang Motors with all his might? 

315
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:39,312
 He knows his grandfather is dying, so he feels sorry for me. 

316
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:43,112
 That's why he's peeing on his frozen foot. 

317
00:24:44,812 --> 00:24:46,482
 That little brat. 

318
00:24:48,982 --> 00:24:50,483
 Don't try to change my mind. 

319
00:24:50,483 --> 00:24:54,022
 That punk is not getting a single penny from me. 

320
00:24:54,022 --> 00:24:56,992
 Sir, Do Jun cares for you as your grandson... 

321
00:24:56,992 --> 00:24:58,732
 You fool! 

322
00:24:59,363 --> 00:25:01,203
 It's not like bullets avoid family members 

323
00:25:01,203 --> 00:25:05,103
 when you're fighting a war! 

324
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:08,842
 One thing that a fighter has no use for, like his appendix, 

325
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:11,413
 is compassion. Sympathy! 

326
00:25:11,413 --> 00:25:16,083
 You cannot afford to drag such useless emotions to a war. 

327
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:18,383
 It'll only weigh you down. 

328
00:25:19,913 --> 00:25:24,093
 But if you leave nothing for Do Jun as this will states, 

329
00:25:24,093 --> 00:25:26,053
 the succession plans will face obstacles, Sir. 

330
00:25:26,053 --> 00:25:28,503
 I will push him to the edge of a cliff. 

331
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:31,692
 That brat... 

332
00:25:31,692 --> 00:25:35,033
 He'll do anything to survive. 

333
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:40,302
 I want him to see how he can be when he's hit rock bottom. 

334
00:25:43,243 --> 00:25:45,273
 I know that 

335
00:25:45,273 --> 00:25:47,272
 he is someone 

336
00:25:47,272 --> 00:25:49,713
 who wouldn't hesitate to sell me 

337
00:25:49,713 --> 00:25:52,453
 to buy Soonyang. 

338
00:25:53,513 --> 00:25:55,723
 If he tramples all over me to go forward, 

339
00:25:55,723 --> 00:26:00,222
 there will be nothing he can't do in the future. 

340
00:26:05,062 --> 00:26:07,292
 Only then... 

341
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:12,402
 can that rascal protect Soonyang and survive. 

342
00:26:16,203 --> 00:26:18,972
 Sir, it's ready. 

343
00:26:18,972 --> 00:26:22,413
 This video can serve as your legal will. 

344
00:26:22,413 --> 00:26:25,713
 - Okay. 
 - Shall we begin then? 

345
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,823
 Sir. 

346
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:43,632
 Just relax and say what you'd like to tell Do Jun. 

347
00:26:48,472 --> 00:26:50,402
 Do Jun? 

348
00:26:52,142 --> 00:26:55,013
 Who is... 

349
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:57,642
 Do Jun, Chairman Jin? 

350
00:27:17,532 --> 00:27:19,803
 Do Jun? 

351
00:27:35,782 --> 00:27:38,653
 He's my grandson. 

352
00:27:43,963 --> 00:27:48,193
 The one who takes after me the most. 

353
00:27:52,102 --> 00:27:54,573
 My grandson. 

354
00:28:46,953 --> 00:28:52,923
 It's Chairman Jin's inheritance he left for you, Do Jun. 

355
00:29:16,953 --> 00:29:18,792
It's this one.

356
00:29:28,132 --> 00:29:29,763
   

357
00:29:43,913 --> 00:29:47,552
 Chairman Jin made sure I handed it over to you 

358
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:50,812
 once you understood the meaning of his will. 

359
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:10,572
Soonyang Micro.

360
00:30:10,572 --> 00:30:14,013
 There was a document that wasn't on the list. 

361
00:30:15,342 --> 00:30:18,053
 It was an old document that had passed the preservation year. 

362
00:30:18,053 --> 00:30:19,682
 So at first, I thought of discarding it. 

363
00:30:19,682 --> 00:30:22,882
 But there was a record that a fairly large amount of money 

364
00:30:22,882 --> 00:30:25,923
 had been stored for a long time. 

365
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,560
   

366
00:30:36,903 --> 00:30:42,003
 Soonyang Micro is a dummy company that only exists on paper. 

367
00:30:42,003 --> 00:30:48,112
 Someone is siphoning Soonyang's money overseas through this paper company, Sir. 

368
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:51,353
 Go retrieve Soonyang's assets that have been siphoned off overseas. 

369
00:30:51,353 --> 00:30:55,523
 That is your first mission as the senior finance manager. 

370
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:59,070
   

371
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,032
Are you sure?

372
00:31:10,032 --> 00:31:14,503
Is this truly the legacy Grandfather had left for me?

373
00:31:14,503 --> 00:31:18,013
Chairman Jin had worked hard preparing it for quite a long time.

374
00:31:18,013 --> 00:31:21,172
To give it to the successor over Soonyang.

375
00:31:21,172 --> 00:31:24,613
Now, no one in Soonyang is aware

376
00:31:24,613 --> 00:31:27,252
of that money's existence.

377
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:30,322
And, of course, the money can't be tracked.

378
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:34,692
It's a perfect slush fund that can't be reduced by gift or inheritance tax.

379
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:36,773
Chairman Jin had made sure

380
00:31:37,623 --> 00:31:40,392
I understood multiple times.

381
00:31:40,392 --> 00:31:45,662
To hand you that only when you have attained the lesson

382
00:31:46,573 --> 00:31:48,833
behind his will.

383
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:51,242
But why did he leave it to me?

384
00:31:53,473 --> 00:31:55,582
If it were such a perfect slush fund,

385
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:59,782
nobody would have found it if you had kept it, Mr. Lee.

386
00:32:00,683 --> 00:32:04,182
Was it your last loyalty to Grandfather

387
00:32:04,182 --> 00:32:06,303
or something like that?

388
00:32:12,192 --> 00:32:15,203
If, at this point, I were to tell you that was the case

389
00:32:15,203 --> 00:32:17,263
would you believe me?

390
00:32:20,032 --> 00:32:23,603
Being born a servant was not my choice.

391
00:32:24,773 --> 00:32:28,542
But I could choose the owner to serve.

392
00:32:32,753 --> 00:32:35,853
Vice-Chairman Jin Young Ki or Jin Dong Ki.

393
00:32:36,652 --> 00:32:39,302
I can't hand over Soonyang to them.

394
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:44,493
Aren't we on the same page, Do Jun?

395
00:32:47,093 --> 00:32:52,333
 He has been elected as the 16th presidential candidate of our party. 

396
00:32:56,942 --> 00:33:00,313
 - Lee Chang Min! 
 - For President! 

397
00:33:01,283 --> 00:33:02,743
Are you happy?

398
00:33:02,743 --> 00:33:06,653
Mayor Choi Chang Je, the icon of economic democratization!

399
00:33:07,282 --> 00:33:11,222
I only found out today that Korea still had a sense of justice.

400
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:15,252
I glamorized and made you, a self-supporting student from the countryside, the mayor of Seoul.

401
00:33:15,252 --> 00:33:17,832
And you betray your wife's family?

402
00:33:17,832 --> 00:33:21,293
Such a man shouldn't become the president.

403
00:33:23,803 --> 00:33:27,503
That shrewd Do Jun didn't like what he had.

404
00:33:27,503 --> 00:33:29,803
So he gathered everyone and turned everything over.

405
00:33:29,803 --> 00:33:31,713
He egged you on

406
00:33:31,713 --> 00:33:33,542
to bring the holding company to naught

407
00:33:33,542 --> 00:33:36,742
and repeal the separation of industrial and financial capital.

408
00:33:38,012 --> 00:33:39,912
No. It was me.

409
00:33:39,912 --> 00:33:43,683
Bringing the financial holding company to naught was my idea from beginning to end.

410
00:33:43,683 --> 00:33:46,153
A tycoon should never own a bank.

411
00:33:46,153 --> 00:33:49,893
That's the political conviction of Choi Chang Je, the tycoon sharpshooter.

412
00:33:52,332 --> 00:33:54,362
Let's hear about your political conviction.

413
00:33:54,362 --> 00:33:57,903
So who will become the president?

414
00:33:57,903 --> 00:34:00,872
For goodness' sake.

415
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,842
You're really something. You really are.

416
00:34:03,842 --> 00:34:06,542
Is that something to ask me right at this moment?

417
00:34:06,542 --> 00:34:09,912
Yes. Right at this moment,

418
00:34:09,912 --> 00:34:13,083
I must tell my brothers, who might end up paying over one trillion won  (1$B) 

419
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:15,352
as inheritance tax because of you,

420
00:34:15,352 --> 00:34:19,523
that I, Jin Hwa Young, am still a useful card

421
00:34:19,523 --> 00:34:22,122
so that your second political life can begin.

422
00:34:22,122 --> 00:34:23,793
Stop it.

423
00:34:23,793 --> 00:34:27,213
So tell me. Who will win the presidential election?

424
00:34:27,213 --> 00:34:29,783
Who must we deliver the money to?

425
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,703
The one in favor

426
00:34:38,213 --> 00:34:40,163
has already been decided, no?

427
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:43,313
Who's the one in favor? Tell me.

428
00:34:43,313 --> 00:34:44,812
This is the men's room!

429
00:34:44,812 --> 00:34:46,583
Who is it?

430
00:34:48,523 --> 00:34:50,182
Are you sure he's in favor?

431
00:34:50,182 --> 00:34:53,553
The ruling party candidate is causing a squall right now.

432
00:34:53,553 --> 00:34:55,992
Come on. It's just a tempest inside a teacup.

433
00:34:55,992 --> 00:34:59,722
Who can go up against us by catching a mere piggy bank?

434
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:05,102
Daeyoung Group also sent off two dump trunks of bills a couple of days ago.

435
00:35:05,102 --> 00:35:07,203
This country is still a long way off.

436
00:35:07,203 --> 00:35:08,903
That candidate in favor.

437
00:35:08,903 --> 00:35:10,742
Isn't he known to be upright?

438
00:35:10,742 --> 00:35:15,372
The more reason he'll love money that's new and crisp.

439
00:35:16,843 --> 00:35:20,612
Let's go with the candidate in favor before it's too late.

440
00:35:20,612 --> 00:35:22,632
Do we not need insurance

441
00:35:23,782 --> 00:35:25,492
for the other candidate?

442
00:35:25,492 --> 00:35:27,722
Let's give them a small token of our sincerity.

443
00:35:27,722 --> 00:35:31,992
If Grandfather had been alive, he would've fully supported one candidate.

444
00:35:33,392 --> 00:35:35,803
Hyungnim Young Ki,

445
00:35:35,803 --> 00:35:38,963
we're in the same boat now, okay?

446
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:47,073
There won't be a need to turn back.

447
00:35:47,073 --> 00:35:51,013
You, my brother, and I agree, after all.

448
00:35:53,113 --> 00:35:57,082
Gosh, really. Our father must feel so reassured,

449
00:35:57,082 --> 00:36:01,592
seeing the close bond the three of his children have.

450
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:03,622
Geez, Hwa Young.

451
00:36:09,063 --> 00:36:13,533
I thought the media would die down once Uncle lost the candidate election.

452
00:36:13,533 --> 00:36:15,972
But he's still at the center of the attention.

453
00:36:15,972 --> 00:36:18,972
A chaebol should not own a bank.

454
00:36:18,972 --> 00:36:21,042
Forty-one percent of the general public agrees.

455
00:36:21,042 --> 00:36:23,383
Seventy-one percent of economics professors agree.

456
00:36:23,383 --> 00:36:26,353
I'm going to make a constitutional appeal.

457
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:28,182
I will, period.

458
00:36:28,182 --> 00:36:31,853
How come? Isn't it a chance for us?

459
00:36:31,853 --> 00:36:34,122
The holding company establishment went to pieces.

460
00:36:34,122 --> 00:36:39,062
Joint shares and voting rights with Uncle Young Ki will mean nothing.

461
00:36:39,062 --> 00:36:41,283
We need to find a way to survive.

462
00:36:41,963 --> 00:36:46,102
So what? Do you have one in mind?

463
00:36:46,133 --> 00:36:48,232
Don't worry, Father.

464
00:36:48,972 --> 00:36:53,112
Right now, there's only one way to become Soonyang Group's head.

465
00:36:53,112 --> 00:36:55,983
It's to have the most shares of Soonyang affiliates

466
00:36:55,983 --> 00:36:58,512
and become the largest shareholder of Soonyang Corporation.

467
00:36:58,512 --> 00:37:01,283
Uncle Dong Ki doesn't even come close to your Soonyang Corporation shares.

468
00:37:01,283 --> 00:37:03,553
Your uncle isn't someone

469
00:37:03,553 --> 00:37:07,822
who will easily give up the head position to me.

470
00:37:09,662 --> 00:37:14,093
By now, I bet he's figuring out the numbers like crazy.

471
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:17,063
Say that again. Do what?

472
00:37:17,063 --> 00:37:22,932
Let's separate financial affiliates from Soonyang Group and make them independent.

473
00:37:24,503 --> 00:37:27,213
We can use public opinion as the pretext.

474
00:37:27,213 --> 00:37:29,613
Rather than the hopeless Soonyang Group head,

475
00:37:29,613 --> 00:37:32,613
doesn't the chairman of a financial group

476
00:37:32,613 --> 00:37:34,553
sound good?

477
00:37:36,523 --> 00:37:39,893
Gosh. Well, I...

478
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:45,123
For Soonyang to become a national company,

479
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:48,363
I'll sacrifice myself.

480
00:37:53,273 --> 00:37:56,142
What brings you here so early, CEO Oh?

481
00:37:56,142 --> 00:37:58,373
Is something going on?

482
00:37:58,373 --> 00:38:01,512
Your face is telling me you haven't heard of the news.

483
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:03,112
What news?

484
00:38:03,112 --> 00:38:08,552
The board of directors of Soonyang Investment dismissed me from the CEO position.

485
00:38:11,452 --> 00:38:13,392
It's not only Soonyang Investment.

486
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:16,162
It includes Soonyang Fire Insurance and Soonyang Asset Management.

487
00:38:16,162 --> 00:38:18,533
The board of directors rose up and replaced all the CEOs.

488
00:38:18,533 --> 00:38:19,662
I know.

489
00:38:19,662 --> 00:38:22,033
Both the board of directors of Soonyang Investment and Soonyang Fire Insurance

490
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,932
are former CEOs or the owners' families.

491
00:38:23,932 --> 00:38:26,432
They're under Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki's influence.

492
00:38:26,432 --> 00:38:27,872
Yes.

493
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:32,722
That means Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki has started to move independently.

494
00:38:34,443 --> 00:38:36,782
Oh, let me get you some coffee. Please wait.

495
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:39,382
 Everyone! 

496
00:38:39,382 --> 00:38:42,953
 Please become wealthy! 

497
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:45,322
 Promise! 

498
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:48,823
 Daeyoung thinks about your success. 

499
00:38:48,823 --> 00:38:50,192
 Daeyoung Card. 

500
00:38:50,192 --> 00:38:54,362
CEO Oh. It's time we sell it.

501
00:38:54,362 --> 00:38:56,163
Soonyang Card.

502
00:38:58,933 --> 00:39:01,472
   

503
00:39:02,943 --> 00:39:04,993
 You're being transferred, Prosecutor Seo. 

504
00:39:06,273 --> 00:39:09,812
 Maybe you bit too hard into Soonyang until now. 

505
00:39:11,042 --> 00:39:13,753
   

506
00:39:13,753 --> 00:39:18,183
Thanks to you, I get to work at the Supreme Central Investigation Division.

507
00:39:18,183 --> 00:39:20,192
Are you that pleased?

508
00:39:21,123 --> 00:39:25,362
I'm glad. I was worried I might have imposed on you.

509
00:39:25,362 --> 00:39:28,533
You weren't too happy about it, were you?

510
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,063
But it's a promotion.

511
00:39:30,063 --> 00:39:31,933
Is it?

512
00:39:31,933 --> 00:39:33,532
I thought it was a demotion.

513
00:39:33,532 --> 00:39:35,142
A demotion? No way.

514
00:39:35,142 --> 00:39:39,803
This is the Prosecutor's Office's flower, Central Investigation Division. It has great power.

515
00:39:39,803 --> 00:39:42,613
We won't know until the presidential election is over.

516
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:46,212
But I heard the next government would abolish the Central Investigation Division.

517
00:39:46,212 --> 00:39:49,852
That rumor has been going on since the civilian government.

518
00:39:49,852 --> 00:39:51,952
This time, it's not just a rumor.

519
00:39:51,952 --> 00:39:55,992
You see, I got transferred to this division.

520
00:39:56,722 --> 00:40:00,992
If the Central Investigation Division were going to keep thriving,

521
00:40:00,992 --> 00:40:03,732
I would not be here.

522
00:40:04,662 --> 00:40:08,472
I'm going home first. You should, too.

523
00:40:28,962 --> 00:40:31,192
 It'll all be over once I'm appointed CEO at the shareholders' meeting. 

524
00:40:31,192 --> 00:40:33,632
 I won't let you down anymore. 

525
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:35,862
 You're wrong. 

526
00:40:35,862 --> 00:40:38,813
 You'll become even more dishonorable. 

527
00:40:38,813 --> 00:40:41,822
 Because you'll want to keep your position. 

528
00:40:51,012 --> 00:40:55,022
Hey. If I want to go independent as Soonyang Financial Group,

529
00:40:55,022 --> 00:40:57,622
there's an urgent business we need to settle.

530
00:40:57,622 --> 00:41:01,193
Is it liquidating Chairman Jin Young Ki's shares in the financial affiliates?

531
00:41:01,193 --> 00:41:03,792
You are half right and half wrong.

532
00:41:03,792 --> 00:41:06,033
How can I buy all of Young Ki hyungnim's shares with the money I have right now?

533
00:41:06,033 --> 00:41:07,093
No, it's impossible.

534
00:41:07,093 --> 00:41:11,633
I need a cash cow to earn me money until the separation is complete.

535
00:41:11,633 --> 00:41:17,733
So is the cash cow slash golden goose you're thinking of inside Soonyang Group?

536
00:41:17,733 --> 00:41:19,443
Soonyang Card.

537
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:22,422
Nothing beats a card company in cash flows.

538
00:41:22,422 --> 00:41:24,983
So I'm going to buy Soonyang Card first.

539
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,812
Do you think Do Jun will sell it?

540
00:41:26,812 --> 00:41:31,483
If it's a cash cow even you have eyes on, I doubt Do Jun will put it out for sale.

541
00:41:31,483 --> 00:41:33,993
I think he'll sell it.

542
00:41:33,993 --> 00:41:35,962
You'll sell it?

543
00:41:37,063 --> 00:41:40,232
You'll sell Sooyang Card to me?

544
00:41:40,232 --> 00:41:41,762
Yes.

545
00:41:50,472 --> 00:41:54,212
It hasn't been that long since you took over Soonyang Card.

546
00:41:54,212 --> 00:41:58,282
Thanks to Cheongwadae lifting all regulations to improve the domestic market

547
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:03,383
before the presidential election, the growth of card companies has been steep.

548
00:42:03,383 --> 00:42:07,422
But you're going to hand it over to me?

549
00:42:08,222 --> 00:42:09,423
Why?

550
00:42:09,423 --> 00:42:12,873
You're going to buy it at a high price, aren't you?

551
00:42:18,432 --> 00:42:23,102
Honestly, even the holding company establishment went down the drain.

552
00:42:23,102 --> 00:42:27,803
So I don't think you, who's quick with numbers and has a great sense of reality,

553
00:42:27,803 --> 00:42:32,713
will waste time clinging to becoming the head of Soonyang Group.

554
00:42:32,713 --> 00:42:34,582
If I were in your shoes, Uncle Dong Ki,

555
00:42:34,582 --> 00:42:40,523
I would go independent from Soonyang Group and consider a separate Financial group.

556
00:42:40,523 --> 00:42:47,222
To do so, I thought you would need Soonyang Card that could bring in cash at any time,

557
00:42:47,222 --> 00:42:50,763
in order to take care of the shares.

558
00:42:50,763 --> 00:42:52,503
You.

559
00:42:53,273 --> 00:42:59,343
Couldn't you, Do Jun, separate Soonyang Financial Group and manage it?

560
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:05,013
You already have Soonyang Card, the cash cow.

561
00:43:05,013 --> 00:43:07,153
Me,

562
00:43:07,982 --> 00:43:12,823
who got branded an evil child blinded by legacy at the shareholders' meeting?

563
00:43:13,553 --> 00:43:18,523
Will Soonyang Group's board of directors, united with loyalties for Grandfather,

564
00:43:18,523 --> 00:43:23,992
choose me as the head and CEO of Soonyang Group?

565
00:43:23,992 --> 00:43:25,033
I don't think so.

566
00:43:25,033 --> 00:43:26,973
Even so,

567
00:43:26,973 --> 00:43:33,243
you foil the plan for the holding company establishment your grandfather had worked so hard on.

568
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:36,073
When you are his grandson?

569
00:43:40,653 --> 00:43:44,503
Because I threw away my dream of succeeding to Soonyang Group.

570
00:43:46,722 --> 00:43:49,723
I'm going to return to my original place.

571
00:43:49,723 --> 00:43:53,142
As Miracle's investment specialist, Jin Do Jun.

572
00:43:54,463 --> 00:43:59,503
So what's most important to me right now isn't Soonyang Group but money, Uncle Dong Ki.

573
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:05,503
And as you already know, the more money, the better.

574
00:44:17,483 --> 00:44:19,123
It looked like he was going to ask

575
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:21,423
for more than 800 billion won  ($800M)  for selling Soonyang Card.

576
00:44:21,423 --> 00:44:23,062
What do you think, Director Baek?

577
00:44:23,062 --> 00:44:25,292
Should I go for it or not?

578
00:44:25,292 --> 00:44:27,093
More than that, Vice-Chairman Jin.

579
00:44:27,093 --> 00:44:29,563
In 2003, the Year of the Black Sheep,

580
00:44:29,563 --> 00:44:35,063
Vice-Chairman Jin Young Ki's new year's fortune will change.

581
00:44:35,063 --> 00:44:36,303
So what?

582
00:44:36,303 --> 00:44:38,773
Vice-Chairman Jin Young Ki has a fate eulmokilju.

583
00:44:38,773 --> 00:44:42,542
He has been in the shade of a large tree, unable to make his way.

584
00:44:42,542 --> 00:44:44,443
But starting in the Year of the Black Sheep,

585
00:44:44,443 --> 00:44:48,413
water will seep into the thirsty tree, which will bring him great luck.

586
00:44:48,413 --> 00:44:50,523
What's this all about, Director Baek?

587
00:44:50,523 --> 00:44:51,553
Hold on.

588
00:44:51,553 --> 00:44:52,852
Out of all the Year of the Black Sheep,

589
00:44:52,852 --> 00:44:58,610
the yin and yang of the Five-elements will attract each other the most this year.

590
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:03,532
And in all probability, there might be a storm like the IMF crisis next year.

591
00:45:03,532 --> 00:45:04,662
Let's be prepared.

592
00:45:04,662 --> 00:45:06,303
What about my fortune?

593
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:09,542
Should I buy Soonyang Card? Does it say I should?

594
00:45:09,542 --> 00:45:11,202
Father.

595
00:45:11,202 --> 00:45:16,112
Your fortune next year is mugyejihwa. It's full of fire.

596
00:45:16,112 --> 00:45:19,483
It meets metal and blazes.

597
00:45:20,582 --> 00:45:25,153
It looks like you're in luck with the finance industry.

598
00:45:25,153 --> 00:45:27,122
What are you two doing?

599
00:45:27,122 --> 00:45:30,523
How can you decide to buy Soonyang Card like this?

600
00:45:30,523 --> 00:45:32,332
You need the opinions of experts.

601
00:45:32,332 --> 00:45:34,533
Director Baek is an expert.

602
00:45:34,533 --> 00:45:37,062
He's an analyst who was formerly an accountant.

603
00:45:37,062 --> 00:45:40,432
Ye Jun, you said that Do Jun won't sell Soonyang Card.

604
00:45:40,432 --> 00:45:44,173
But look. Everything is unfolding according to his words.

605
00:45:44,173 --> 00:45:47,642
Eight hundred billion won  ($800M)  is too much money to leave up to luck.

606
00:45:47,642 --> 00:45:53,043
I know how good Director Baek is because we've worked together all along.

607
00:45:54,753 --> 00:46:00,723
You're admitting that you've been running the company like this to this day.

608
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:05,293
- Does the Internal auditor know? 
 - Jin Ye Jun!

609
00:46:05,293 --> 00:46:08,193
You punk. Get out.

610
00:46:08,193 --> 00:46:12,202
You're the only one who doesn't qualify to be here now.

611
00:46:21,012 --> 00:46:22,982
Vice-Chairman Jin, do you remember?

612
00:46:22,982 --> 00:46:25,483
When the US stock market crashed after the September 11 attack,

613
00:46:25,483 --> 00:46:27,312
if you went with my advice,

614
00:46:27,312 --> 00:46:32,622
you wouldn't have lost Soonyang Investment to Miracle Investment.

615
00:46:32,622 --> 00:46:34,753
Make a call.

616
00:46:35,423 --> 00:46:38,323
I'm buying Soonyang Card.

617
00:46:38,323 --> 00:46:42,592
Do you really think Soonyang Card is only worth 800 billion won  ($800M) ?

618
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:48,832
Okay, then.

619
00:46:48,832 --> 00:46:52,322
Let's negotiate the details when we meet next time.

620
00:46:53,213 --> 00:46:55,412
Yes, give me a call.

621
00:47:06,752 --> 00:47:10,123
You're selling Soonyang Card to whom?

622
00:47:10,892 --> 00:47:12,992
Is it Uncle Dong Ki?

623
00:47:15,502 --> 00:47:18,452
He can't answer, which means I'm right, Father.

624
00:47:25,443 --> 00:47:27,043
Hey.

625
00:47:27,943 --> 00:47:29,212
What brings you here today?

626
00:47:29,212 --> 00:47:32,512
He'd like to go with you on his way to work.

627
00:47:43,792 --> 00:47:47,693
I hear Do Jun will sell Soonyang Card.

628
00:47:48,463 --> 00:47:52,502
I heard that you stepped in as the new owner.

629
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:54,373
What are you saying?

630
00:47:54,373 --> 00:47:57,742
Who said that? Do Jun?

631
00:47:58,602 --> 00:48:02,542
Do you still believe what Do Jun says?

632
00:48:02,542 --> 00:48:04,613
It's fine if it isn't you.

633
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:10,282
I thought a go-getter like you was trying to break away as a financial group,

634
00:48:10,282 --> 00:48:12,952
so I had to hurry over from the morning.

635
00:48:13,952 --> 00:48:18,363
This is unsettling. I should use this chance to purchase Soonyang Card.

636
00:48:18,363 --> 00:48:19,992
You're going to buy Soonyang Card?

637
00:48:19,992 --> 00:48:23,863
That way, there would be zero chance for the affiliates to break away.

638
00:48:23,863 --> 00:48:27,003
I also don't want to be mistaken about you over a rumor,

639
00:48:27,003 --> 00:48:29,102
which will lead me down the evil path.

640
00:48:29,102 --> 00:48:31,652
Nothing good can come from that between us.

641
00:48:33,113 --> 00:48:36,412
Dong Ki, don't forget.

642
00:48:36,412 --> 00:48:39,282
It's only meaningful when we are united.

643
00:48:39,282 --> 00:48:43,122
Both Soonyang and us brothers.

644
00:48:53,492 --> 00:48:55,733
Hey, Jin Do Jun!

645
00:49:02,003 --> 00:49:04,202
What do you want?

646
00:49:04,202 --> 00:49:08,472
Are you trying to pit Hyungnim Young Ki against me over Soonyang Card?

647
00:49:08,472 --> 00:49:11,182
I would never do that.

648
00:49:11,182 --> 00:49:14,153
I was always taught to stop fights and strike a bargain.

649
00:49:14,153 --> 00:49:16,412
What?

650
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:21,153
Thanks to that, Uncle Dong Ki, you ran over here at this hour.

651
00:49:22,963 --> 00:49:26,032
In that case, why don't we start the proper negotiation?

652
00:49:26,032 --> 00:49:27,792
Shall we?

653
00:49:28,593 --> 00:49:34,603
You offered 800 billion won  ($800M)  for Soonyang Card, so let's start the bargain at twice that price.

654
00:49:34,603 --> 00:49:36,602
Twice?

655
00:49:37,303 --> 00:49:39,653
I want 1.6 trillion won  ($1.6B). 

656
00:49:39,653 --> 00:49:43,642
That's the price for Soonyang Card offered by Jeongsimjae.

657
00:49:48,613 --> 00:49:50,753
If you need more time to think...

658
00:49:50,753 --> 00:49:53,193
Wait! Can I pay half and half?

659
00:49:53,193 --> 00:49:57,023
I'll transfer 800 billion won  ($800M)  today and the rest of 800 billion next time.

660
00:49:57,023 --> 00:50:00,633
Okay, sure. As long as the collateral is solid.

661
00:50:00,633 --> 00:50:04,743
Are you demanding the shares of the financial affiliates?

662
00:50:04,743 --> 00:50:05,632
Hey, you punk!

663
00:50:05,632 --> 00:50:08,872
I'll take Soonyang Corporation's shares as collateral.

664
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:10,972
Two percent of your share.

665
00:50:11,702 --> 00:50:14,252
I don't care for the financial group.

666
00:50:14,252 --> 00:50:16,542
Don't worry about it.

667
00:50:16,542 --> 00:50:17,982
Then why?

668
00:50:17,982 --> 00:50:20,953
Among all of your assets including real estate,

669
00:50:20,953 --> 00:50:24,053
isn't that the most valuable as collateral?

670
00:50:24,053 --> 00:50:26,253
The shares of the Corporation.

671
00:50:28,323 --> 00:50:30,573
I'll get it ready and call you.

672
00:50:31,463 --> 00:50:32,732
I do have one more condition.

673
00:50:32,732 --> 00:50:34,962
Good grief, what?

674
00:50:39,332 --> 00:50:41,903
I need some untraceable money,

675
00:50:41,903 --> 00:50:45,103
apart from the sale price for Soonyang Card.

676
00:50:45,912 --> 00:50:47,512
A slush fund?

677
00:50:51,443 --> 00:50:53,813
It truly is the high season.

678
00:50:53,813 --> 00:50:56,182
Even an investment company like Miracle is

679
00:50:56,182 --> 00:50:59,992
preparing political funds for the presidential election?

680
00:50:59,992 --> 00:51:02,762
According to CEO Oh Se Hyeon, in the US,

681
00:51:02,762 --> 00:51:05,892
Wall Street is the funding behind the presidential election.

682
00:51:05,892 --> 00:51:10,042
That 45 percent of political funds come from Wall Street.

683
00:51:10,042 --> 00:51:12,102
It means the main industry has changed.

684
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:13,103
From manufacturing to finance.

685
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:15,233
Do you know

686
00:51:15,233 --> 00:51:20,843
to whom and how you should transfer the money to make sure there's no trouble later?

687
00:51:20,843 --> 00:51:22,213
Trouble?

688
00:51:22,213 --> 00:51:23,713
You need to bribe them

689
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:27,512
without a delivery mistake and not letting anyone else know.

690
00:51:27,512 --> 00:51:30,803
Well, I guess your father doesn't have what it takes

691
00:51:30,803 --> 00:51:33,892
to teach you something like that.

692
00:51:33,892 --> 00:51:36,423
And CEO Oh may know a lot about Wall Street,

693
00:51:36,423 --> 00:51:40,023
but he's probably a layman when it comes to Yeouido*. 
  (Korean political arena) 

694
00:51:41,592 --> 00:51:46,703
This is a man we've worked with since your grandfather's days.

695
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:48,533
Call him.

696
00:51:50,802 --> 00:51:52,003
   

697
00:51:52,003 --> 00:51:53,912
I see.

698
00:51:59,952 --> 00:52:01,983
   

699
00:52:13,162 --> 00:52:16,633
 He made a slush fund by using dormant accounts 

700
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:19,273
 of Soonyang Fire Insurance and Soonyang Investment. 

701
00:52:19,273 --> 00:52:22,673
I see. Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki is nothing like how he looks.

702
00:52:22,673 --> 00:52:24,472
I thought he was the timid, nerdy type,

703
00:52:24,472 --> 00:52:27,772
but he's a man with great spirit.

704
00:52:27,772 --> 00:52:31,343
He borrowed the dormant accounts of his clients to do this deed.

705
00:52:31,343 --> 00:52:34,912
And it was during the IMF crisis, while everyone was wailing.

706
00:52:34,912 --> 00:52:37,253
Goodness, so bold.

707
00:52:37,253 --> 00:52:38,823
He's not afraid of anything.

708
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:42,423
He probably couldn't imagine that of all people,

709
00:52:42,423 --> 00:52:46,162
CEO Oh Se Hyeon of Miracle became the CEO of Soonyang Investment

710
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:49,432
and found his biggest weakness.

711
00:52:52,432 --> 00:52:54,832
His daughter is something, too.

712
00:52:54,832 --> 00:52:57,343
She's in a different league compared to other tycoons' kids.

713
00:52:57,343 --> 00:53:00,742
You said she passionately volunteers in third-world countries, right?

714
00:53:00,742 --> 00:53:04,912
She only volunteers in countries where she can evade taxes.

715
00:53:04,912 --> 00:53:09,613
Thanks to her, we made ten billion won  ($10M)  in cash slush fund without any trouble.

716
00:53:09,613 --> 00:53:14,292
The fruit of someone else's work is always the most delicious.

717
00:53:14,292 --> 00:53:16,222
I find this even more delicious.

718
00:53:16,222 --> 00:53:18,422
What is this?

719
00:53:18,422 --> 00:53:19,392
Come on.

720
00:53:19,392 --> 00:53:21,932
 - Roh Moo Hyun! 
 - Roh Moo Hyun! 

721
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:25,433
 - Roh Moo Hyun! Roh Moo Hyun! 
   

722
00:53:28,903 --> 00:53:32,272
I was easily persuaded by Dong Ki once again.

723
00:53:32,272 --> 00:53:33,943
Good grief.

724
00:53:34,943 --> 00:53:38,643
What now? Go with the flow before it's too late?

725
00:53:38,643 --> 00:53:40,653
Two brothers should get on the same boat?

726
00:53:40,653 --> 00:53:43,122
How much money did I load on that boat?

727
00:53:43,122 --> 00:53:46,923
You should be helping me in some way as my older brother.

728
00:53:46,923 --> 00:53:49,292
What now? There's no need to turn back?

729
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:51,093
We should unite as brothers?

730
00:53:51,093 --> 00:53:51,962
Okay, sure.

731
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:56,293
Why don't you pray that we'll jump in the water together and die?

732
00:53:56,293 --> 00:53:59,332
You said the candidate in favor was decided.

733
00:53:59,972 --> 00:54:04,133
Didn't you say the law of an election is that the general trend cannot be overturned?

734
00:54:04,133 --> 00:54:06,512
I did. But don't you know?

735
00:54:06,512 --> 00:54:09,682
Everything comes with an exception. You Should've heard me out to the end.

736
00:54:09,682 --> 00:54:11,542
What did you say?

737
00:54:12,343 --> 00:54:15,513
The law of the Korean president elections is that the big trend cannot be overturned.

738
00:54:15,513 --> 00:54:18,723
However, that is only until a sharp gust blows.

739
00:54:18,723 --> 00:54:20,192
The opposition party had the general popularity,

740
00:54:20,192 --> 00:54:23,642
but the ruling party's candidate turned out to be a gust.

741
00:54:23,642 --> 00:54:28,233
So go tell your brothers that we should lie low for a while as the wind blows.

742
00:54:28,233 --> 00:54:31,832
Go tell them yourself.

743
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:36,503
They lost 30 billion won  ($30M)  at your word!

744
00:54:39,273 --> 00:54:42,373
Goodness, look who this is.

745
00:54:43,843 --> 00:54:47,453
Yes, congratulations, Mr. President.

746
00:54:47,453 --> 00:54:51,122
Yes, right. I should have called first.

747
00:54:51,122 --> 00:54:52,922
Yes.

748
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:55,453
Yes. Pardon?

749
00:54:57,022 --> 00:54:58,962
Me?

750
00:55:00,332 --> 00:55:04,632
Yes, I'll do my best if you leave me to it.

751
00:55:04,632 --> 00:55:06,503
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

752
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:09,373
Yes. Goodbye.

753
00:55:12,302 --> 00:55:13,782
What?

754
00:55:13,782 --> 00:55:20,782
He wants to appoint me as the Minister of Justice.

755
00:55:21,553 --> 00:55:23,583
Did he call the right man?

756
00:55:23,583 --> 00:55:28,353
You two are affiliated with opposite parties.

757
00:55:29,153 --> 00:55:30,493
I doubt you two speak the same language.

758
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,262
That's why.

759
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:36,793
He said I'm the face of unification of the two parties.

760
00:55:41,303 --> 00:55:42,803
How so?

761
00:55:42,803 --> 00:55:45,542
 Credit card delinquency rate continues to rise up, 

762
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:48,042
 and it recorded an all-time high in just two years. 

763
00:55:48,042 --> 00:55:50,682
 This is the breakdown of Lee's credit card usage. 

764
00:55:50,682 --> 00:55:54,582
 He maxed out all four credit cards in cash advances, 

765
00:55:54,582 --> 00:55:57,223
 then paid one card off with another and was banned from new loans. 

766
00:55:57,223 --> 00:55:59,253
 Your credit card is two months overdue. 

767
00:55:59,253 --> 00:56:03,523
 Until last year, credit defaulters rose by 60,000 to 70,000 people a month. 

768
00:56:03,523 --> 00:56:05,932
 But this year, this increased by 100,000 people a month, 

769
00:56:05,932 --> 00:56:09,382
 reaching a total of three million at the end of last month. 

770
00:56:16,642 --> 00:56:21,112
You encouraged me to buy Soonyang Card.

771
00:56:26,553 --> 00:56:29,882
What was that about metal and whatnot?

772
00:56:29,882 --> 00:56:31,553
It's set ablaze?

773
00:56:31,553 --> 00:56:33,722
I'm in luck with the financial industry?

774
00:56:33,722 --> 00:56:36,352
What is this? What now?

775
00:56:36,352 --> 00:56:39,392
None of the fortunetelling is right.

776
00:56:39,392 --> 00:56:43,302
Actually, the energy of fire is too strong this year

777
00:56:43,302 --> 00:56:46,862
and melts the metal and makes it disappear.

778
00:56:48,903 --> 00:56:50,903
Hey, this guy.

779
00:56:51,872 --> 00:56:54,342
Is that what you should say now?

780
00:56:55,273 --> 00:56:57,183
Wait.

781
00:56:58,242 --> 00:57:02,353
So what is this? Will Soonyang Card go bankrupt?

782
00:57:03,523 --> 00:57:05,883
Contact the government for additional support. Now.

783
00:57:05,883 --> 00:57:08,853
Financial Supervisory Service is giving us pressure

784
00:57:08,853 --> 00:57:10,762
- to help ourselves first. 
 - Help ourselves?

785
00:57:10,762 --> 00:57:13,662
You should liquidate the shares of other affiliates first...

786
00:57:13,662 --> 00:57:15,393
You!

787
00:57:17,733 --> 00:57:21,133
Then how will I be separated as a financial group?

788
00:57:23,103 --> 00:57:28,142
I can only think of one way out of this mess.

789
00:57:33,813 --> 00:57:36,182
   

790
00:57:36,182 --> 00:57:38,952
You can't suddenly stop the cash advance service!

791
00:57:38,952 --> 00:57:41,492
You aren't allowed to do this without our agreement!

792
00:57:41,492 --> 00:57:44,562
- He's right! 
 - I need the money now!

793
00:57:45,293 --> 00:57:46,892
After the halt on cash advance service,

794
00:57:46,892 --> 00:57:49,633
the share price for all affiliations has plummeted.

795
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:52,003
He can't even take control of some credit card company.

796
00:57:52,003 --> 00:57:54,133
How can he want to separate as a financial group?

797
00:57:54,133 --> 00:57:56,783
Is Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki in his office?

798
00:58:04,512 --> 00:58:07,682
You finally showed your face, my brother.

799
00:58:07,682 --> 00:58:11,352
You never bothered to call when I desperately looked for you

800
00:58:11,352 --> 00:58:14,402
to pay back the credit card bond.

801
00:58:14,402 --> 00:58:17,523
But you ran over at once, once the stock prices dropped.

802
00:58:17,523 --> 00:58:23,273
How much do you need to bring back the cash advance service?

803
00:58:23,273 --> 00:58:25,553
I need 400 billion won  ($400M)  for now.

804
00:58:25,553 --> 00:58:29,452
You're about to go bankrupt because you don't have 400 billion won?

805
00:58:30,102 --> 00:58:32,673
Didn't you dream of creating a financial group?

806
00:58:32,673 --> 00:58:37,413
How can you let this go bankrupt over just 400 billion won  ($400M) ?

807
00:58:41,353 --> 00:58:45,203
If Soonyang Card goes bankrupt, it'll put you in worse trouble.

808
00:58:46,892 --> 00:58:50,423
Two percent of my shares for Soonyang Corporation is...

809
00:58:50,423 --> 00:58:52,562
What about those shares?

810
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:58,962
When I bought Soonyang Card, I gave it to Miracle as collateral.

811
00:59:01,572 --> 00:59:06,703
I'm saying two percent of Soonyang Corporation will end up in Do Jun's hands.

812
00:59:13,552 --> 00:59:18,582
Since I'm the elder of this family, I thought I should figure this out.

813
00:59:18,582 --> 00:59:22,093
My brother is about to go bankrupt with Soonyang Card any day now,

814
00:59:22,093 --> 00:59:24,192
but my nephew,

815
00:59:24,192 --> 00:59:28,593
you still need to receive 800 billion won  ($800M)  from selling Soonyang Card?

816
00:59:29,563 --> 00:59:33,802
Don't worry. I'll pay the promissory note.

817
00:59:36,642 --> 00:59:37,872
You will?

818
00:59:37,872 --> 00:59:41,272
The government and the media are all over me saying

819
00:59:41,272 --> 00:59:46,090
I should step on on the group level and restore the card company.

820
00:59:47,443 --> 00:59:50,853
How should I take responsibility for those deadbeat people

821
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:55,453
who didn't know their worth and maxed out their cards, paying off one with another?

822
00:59:55,453 --> 00:59:57,392
We broke the champagne a little too early

823
00:59:57,392 --> 01:00:01,342
and went through the IMF crisis, yet people still are this foolish.

824
01:00:01,342 --> 01:00:04,403
The entire country is in a moral hazard.

825
01:00:09,333 --> 01:00:12,073
I can't do that, Uncle Young Ki.

826
01:00:12,802 --> 01:00:16,812
I cannot give you the shares for Soonyang Corporation.

827
01:00:18,012 --> 01:00:21,713
Does this mean you still haven't given up on Soonyang?

828
01:00:21,713 --> 01:00:24,863
I took this money in return for giving up Soonyang.

829
01:00:24,863 --> 01:00:27,152
We need to do the math right.

830
01:00:29,423 --> 01:00:34,163
I'm owed 800 billion won  ($800M)  for selling Soonyang Card,

831
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:40,733
but what you want from me is Soonyang Corporation's shares I took as collateral, right?

832
01:00:40,733 --> 01:00:43,602
That's something you must have in order to become the head of the group.

833
01:00:45,842 --> 01:00:49,572
I want twice as much, 1.6 trillion won  ($1.6B) .

834
01:00:50,142 --> 01:00:52,312
What? 1.6 trillion won?

835
01:00:52,312 --> 01:00:56,312
You'll be the next chairman and Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's successor.

836
01:00:57,182 --> 01:00:59,832
You can't put a price on such a position.

837
01:01:11,062 --> 01:01:17,500
   

838
01:01:26,682 --> 01:01:29,313
I think 1.6 trillion won  ($1.6B)  would have helped

839
01:01:29,313 --> 01:01:31,763
Soonyang Card get back on their feet.

840
01:01:32,753 --> 01:01:38,322
But you used this money to buy Soonyang Group's chairman position.

841
01:01:45,432 --> 01:01:46,932
Right.

842
01:01:49,173 --> 01:01:53,343
Did you say the entire country is in a moral hazard?

843
01:01:54,943 --> 01:01:57,842
I think so too, Uncle Young Ki.

844
01:02:22,873 --> 01:02:29,780
   

845
01:02:32,382 --> 01:02:35,983
   

846
01:02:38,753 --> 01:02:42,323
   

847
01:02:42,323 --> 01:02:45,670
   

848
01:02:53,733 --> 01:02:56,772
   

849
01:02:56,772 --> 01:03:00,673
   

850
01:03:03,942 --> 01:03:06,442
   

851
01:03:15,853 --> 01:03:18,640
   

852
01:03:24,103 --> 01:03:26,403
   

853
01:03:38,213 --> 01:03:40,642
   

854
01:03:49,552 --> 01:03:52,502
 The person you have reached is unavailable. Please leave... 

855
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:06,300
   

856
01:04:16,182 --> 01:04:19,152
Hey, Dae Kyun. Yes, it's me, Hyeon Woo.

857
01:04:19,152 --> 01:04:20,823
Have you been well?

858
01:04:20,823 --> 01:04:24,152
Well, by any chance,

859
01:04:24,152 --> 01:04:27,463
I was wondering if I could borrow some money.

860
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:29,462
Hey, Tae Hyun.

861
01:04:29,462 --> 01:04:31,963
Can you let me borrow just 5,000,000 won  ($5000) ?

862
01:04:31,963 --> 01:04:34,472
Can you let me borrow some money?

863
01:04:34,472 --> 01:04:36,102
I'm calling for the livelihood loan program.

864
01:04:36,102 --> 01:04:39,502
Can a contract worker like me take out a loan?

865
01:04:41,713 --> 01:04:43,873
Is that so?

866
01:04:43,873 --> 01:04:47,113
No, I see.

867
01:04:47,912 --> 01:04:49,383
Yes, have a good night.

868
01:04:49,383 --> 01:04:51,323
Yes, goodbye.

869
01:05:21,753 --> 01:05:23,983
What happened, Father?

870
01:05:23,983 --> 01:05:26,753
Why won't you pick up your phone?

871
01:05:27,693 --> 01:05:30,262
Where have you been all along?

872
01:05:30,262 --> 01:05:32,792
You left the sick kid at the hospital alone.

873
01:05:32,792 --> 01:05:34,693
Let's talk at home.

874
01:05:34,693 --> 01:05:38,563
Hyeon Min will be discharged tomorrow.

875
01:05:41,403 --> 01:05:43,553
What about the hospital bill?

876
01:05:45,972 --> 01:05:48,972
How can he be discharged? We don't have any money.

877
01:05:50,582 --> 01:05:52,412
I took care of everything.

878
01:05:52,412 --> 01:05:55,412
You don't have to worry.

879
01:05:59,353 --> 01:06:02,053
   

880
01:06:03,262 --> 01:06:05,262
Father.

881
01:06:05,262 --> 01:06:07,492
We need to talk.

882
01:06:09,592 --> 01:06:14,960
   

883
01:06:23,073 --> 01:06:28,373
Father, by any chance, did you take out a private loan?

884
01:06:29,582 --> 01:06:32,052
I'll pay back everything.

885
01:06:34,093 --> 01:06:36,393
You don't have to mind it.

886
01:06:37,892 --> 01:06:40,392
You're going to pay it back?

887
01:06:41,593 --> 01:06:43,943
You're a credit delinquent.

888
01:06:43,943 --> 01:06:45,832
You're unemployed.

889
01:06:47,332 --> 01:06:49,382
How will you do that?

890
01:06:50,472 --> 01:06:52,342
What's your plan?

891
01:06:53,573 --> 01:06:56,873
Then what else could I do as a father?

892
01:06:56,873 --> 01:06:57,942
I needed to do something.

893
01:06:57,942 --> 01:07:00,812
Just don't do anything!

894
01:07:01,883 --> 01:07:04,052
Father.

895
01:07:04,052 --> 01:07:06,883
Will you just stay still?

896
01:07:06,883 --> 01:07:10,592
Everyone else is a decent parent, so you don't need to be one!

897
01:07:12,693 --> 01:07:14,762
Dad, please.

898
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:19,162
All you need to do is breathe and stay alive.

899
01:07:19,162 --> 01:07:21,332
Help me live, okay?

900
01:07:27,243 --> 01:07:33,993
 That night, my poverty was a jerk. 

901
01:07:51,763 --> 01:07:53,333
Yes, I'm the chauffeur.

902
01:07:53,333 --> 01:07:54,533
Yes, I'm almost there.

903
01:07:54,533 --> 01:07:57,642
May I ask once again for the location?

904
01:07:58,773 --> 01:07:59,642
It's bitter.

905
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:01,172
Excuse me.

906
01:08:01,172 --> 01:08:02,413
One more drink, please.

907
01:08:02,413 --> 01:08:06,283
Did anyone call for chauffeur service?

908
01:08:06,283 --> 01:08:08,283
- Over here. 
 - Hello.

909
01:08:08,283 --> 01:08:09,952
Mr. Yoon?

910
01:08:09,952 --> 01:08:11,823
Goodness, it is you.

911
01:08:11,823 --> 01:08:13,552
Do you work as a chauffeur?

912
01:08:13,552 --> 01:08:15,292
Do you have two jobs?

913
01:08:15,292 --> 01:08:17,823
- Hello. 
 - It won't affect your day job, will it?

914
01:08:17,823 --> 01:08:21,033
You need a good performance to sign with us again.

915
01:08:21,033 --> 01:08:26,363
I dread how kids these days are only concerned about money.

916
01:08:26,363 --> 01:08:28,133
Why? It's nice to be rich.

917
01:08:28,133 --> 01:08:31,142
Mr. Yoon, I hope you get rich.

918
01:08:33,543 --> 01:08:35,343
Please enjoy.

919
01:09:28,893 --> 01:09:30,833
Hey. Hey!

920
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,262
Hey, what's wrong?

921
01:09:32,262 --> 01:09:34,472
- What's wrong? 
 - Hey, you need to stop the car.

922
01:09:34,472 --> 01:09:37,942
- Has he gone insane? 
 - Stop the car now!

923
01:09:43,812 --> 01:09:46,413
- Hey, let's go. 
 - Hey, get out of the car.

924
01:09:46,413 --> 01:09:48,353
Get out. Get out of here.

925
01:09:48,353 --> 01:09:50,752
- Hey, darn you. 
 - What are you going?

926
01:09:50,752 --> 01:09:51,882
Get out!

927
01:09:51,882 --> 01:09:53,452
What kind of a psycho are you?

928
01:09:53,452 --> 01:09:55,522
Hey, you.

929
01:09:55,522 --> 01:09:58,293
- Man, I'm going to kill you. 
 - Ju Young, stop.

930
01:09:58,293 --> 01:10:00,533
- Man, I'll get you. 
 - Ju Young, stop.

931
01:10:00,533 --> 01:10:02,432
- Let's go. 
 - Good grief.

932
01:10:02,432 --> 01:10:03,903
Call another chauffeur.

933
01:10:03,903 --> 01:10:06,963
Man, he's making me mad.

934
01:10:28,052 --> 01:10:30,852
 I inherited wealth. 

935
01:10:30,852 --> 01:10:34,393
 Poverty was passed down to you. 

936
01:10:35,993 --> 01:10:40,462
 We live in the same time, 

937
01:10:40,462 --> 01:10:45,932
 under the same sky, but in different worlds. 

938
01:10:49,073 --> 01:10:52,123
 We're worlds apart, like the previous life and this life, 

939
01:10:55,153 --> 01:10:57,412
 in a faraway orbit. 

940
01:11:01,752 --> 01:11:06,940
   

941
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:16,960


942
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:39,130
♫   I imagine,  you who are like a miracle   ♫

943
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:45,392
 Why are you so proud of your infamous loan shark family of Myeong-dong? 

944
01:11:45,392 --> 01:11:51,132
 We used that dirty money to buy out everything to turn my husband into the chairman. 

945
01:11:51,132 --> 01:11:54,543
 The group will be succeeded by the eldest son once again. 

946
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:56,742
 My father, me, and my son. 

947
01:11:56,742 --> 01:11:58,612
 As soon as we receive two percent of the Corporation, 

948
01:11:58,612 --> 01:12:02,283
 we'll announce the new chairman of Soonyang Group, Chairman Jin. 

949
01:12:02,283 --> 01:12:06,723
 I'm the biggest shareholder of Soonyang Corporation. 

950
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:08,623
 Call her. 

951
01:12:08,623 --> 01:12:11,293
 There's someone you want to meet on a day like this, right? 

952
01:12:11,293 --> 01:12:15,993
 You’re under arrest without a warrant for the illegal payment of campaign funds. 

953
01:12:15,993 --> 01:12:20,380
 We meet again like this, as a prosecutor and a suspect. 

954
01:12:20,380 --> 01:12:25,580
♫   All the lights in the world that I couldn’t see   ♫

955
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:28,560
♫   are shining because of you   ♫
