1
00:00:00,722 --> 00:00:02,836
   

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:08,035
After a long discussion, Miracle Investment decided...

3
00:00:08,035 --> 00:00:10,276
   
   

4
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:13,950
not to take over Soonyang Card.

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,245
Were you aware of this?

6
00:00:15,245 --> 00:00:18,456
This is making a fool out of the creditors.

7
00:00:18,456 --> 00:00:21,155
You can't do this now.

8
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:24,595
I've looked into Miracle Investment.

9
00:00:24,595 --> 00:00:27,765
The third-generation heir of Soonyang is a majority shareholder, I heard.

10
00:00:27,765 --> 00:00:33,166
I guess Soonyang wants to play tug of war with Cheongwadae and the creditors.

11
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,235
I'll take it.

12
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:38,135
I'll order a suspension of business of Soonyang Card.

13
00:00:39,646 --> 00:00:41,306
You can't do that.

14
00:00:41,306 --> 00:00:44,545
Suspension of business means bankruptcy.

15
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,616
How can we banks collect on the bad debt?

16
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:49,316
Is Cheongwadae going to take responsibility?

17
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:51,985
The financial supervisory service must take responsibility.

18
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:56,625
This happened because you carelessly issued credit cards to people who couldn't even pay the money back.

19
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,155
How is that our fault?

20
00:00:58,155 --> 00:01:01,026
It's the previous government's fault for blindly removing regulations

21
00:01:01,026 --> 00:01:04,435
saying we need to boost domestic demand to overcome the IMF crisis.

22
00:01:04,435 --> 00:01:07,965
Since the power was handed over, the current government must take responsibility.

23
00:01:07,965 --> 00:01:10,276
Why would Cheongwadae be responsible for it?

24
00:01:10,276 --> 00:01:13,505
You guys overissued credit cards for your own benefit!

25
00:01:13,505 --> 00:01:15,676
   

26
00:01:16,745 --> 00:01:20,446
Miracle Investment will take responsibility.

27
00:01:21,986 --> 00:01:25,686
Under just one condition.

28
00:01:26,546 --> 00:01:28,225
What is that condition?

29
00:01:28,225 --> 00:01:31,755
Fifty-one percent of people who became delinquents because they couldn't pay back the money

30
00:01:31,755 --> 00:01:34,725
are entrepreneurs in their fifties and unemployed.

31
00:01:34,725 --> 00:01:37,695
They say Korea got over the IMF crisis early,

32
00:01:37,695 --> 00:01:41,106
but for these people, the IMF crisis is still ongoing.

33
00:01:41,106 --> 00:01:45,143
They need a second chance.

34
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:48,576
If they can't stand on the same starting line,

35
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:51,816
they at least need that much for the game to be fair.

36
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:57,356
Please introduce the personal workout rule.

37
00:01:57,356 --> 00:02:02,356
So that delinquents can pay back their debts, and start anew.

38
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:04,725
This is Miracle Investment's condition.

39
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,665
We will not allow the pardoning of credit card debts.

40
00:02:06,665 --> 00:02:09,665
That's the principle of the President.

41
00:02:09,665 --> 00:02:11,465
It's not pardoning.

42
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:14,336
I'm going to make them take responsibility for this card issue.

43
00:02:14,336 --> 00:02:18,035
It’s not a matter of losing moral responsibility as they will pay back the money.

44
00:02:18,035 --> 00:02:19,445
That's right.

45
00:02:19,445 --> 00:02:22,646
If Cheongwadae and the creditors take responsibility for the workout,

46
00:02:22,646 --> 00:02:25,516
Miracle Investment will take responsibility, too.

47
00:02:25,516 --> 00:02:30,016
What do you think of Miracle Investment taking over both Soonyang and Daeyoung Cards

48
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,556
as a way to clean up the bad debts?

49
00:02:36,296 --> 00:02:38,396
Daeyoung Card too?

50
00:02:38,396 --> 00:02:40,189
If Cheongwadae...

51
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:45,195
tames the spirits of the two conglomerates,

52
00:02:45,195 --> 00:02:47,116
Soonyang and Daeyoung, who are known for not following orders,

53
00:02:47,116 --> 00:02:49,935
and solves the credit card issue,

54
00:02:49,935 --> 00:02:53,775
no citizen would call it an amateur government.

55
00:02:58,216 --> 00:03:00,082
   

56
00:03:00,082 --> 00:03:03,730
   

57
00:03:05,556 --> 00:03:08,926
What was that, Fellow Korean Lad? You didn't tell me about Daeyoug Card before. 
    

58
00:03:08,926 --> 00:03:12,856
I thought they would only agree to the personal workout policy if the creditors changed their minds.

59
00:03:12,856 --> 00:03:17,595
Why? Will you rescue three million delinquents and run for President next time?

60
00:03:17,595 --> 00:03:21,306
CEO Oh, show me your wallet.

61
00:03:22,365 --> 00:03:23,936
What?

62
00:03:24,936 --> 00:03:27,090
What's this suddenly?

63
00:03:28,045 --> 00:03:29,745
Let's see.

64
00:03:30,446 --> 00:03:34,416
You have more cards than 10,000 won  ($10)  notes.

65
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:38,155
Today, I did exactly what I learned from you.

66
00:03:38,155 --> 00:03:40,626
I bought what has future value when it was at its cheapest.

67
00:03:40,626 --> 00:03:43,795
Two for one at that.

68
00:03:44,896 --> 00:03:46,496
I'll call you when it's ready.

69
00:03:46,496 --> 00:03:47,965
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

70
00:03:47,965 --> 00:03:49,566
Next customer for Counter Two.

71
00:03:49,566 --> 00:03:51,496
   

72
00:03:51,496 --> 00:03:52,536
How can I help you?

73
00:03:52,536 --> 00:03:54,565
I'm here for the consumer proposal.

74
00:03:54,565 --> 00:03:58,035
Consumer proposal? A moment, please.

75
00:03:58,035 --> 00:04:01,675
   
   

76
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:17,700
   
   

77
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,690
   
   

78
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,165
   

79
00:04:22,165 --> 00:04:23,565
   

80
00:04:23,565 --> 00:04:25,499
   

81
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:30,105
Next, please watch the video of Vice-Chairman Jin Young Ki's interview.

82
00:04:30,105 --> 00:04:32,006
 Father. 

83
00:04:32,035 --> 00:04:34,405
 It's me, your eldest son. 

84
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:38,979
 For the past year, I felt your empty seat 

85
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:44,115
 and realized how lacking I was every single day. 

86
00:04:44,115 --> 00:04:46,555
 Don't worry too much. 

87
00:04:46,555 --> 00:04:48,188
 As you taught me... 

88
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:50,655
They say the position makes the person.

89
00:04:50,655 --> 00:04:54,756
- Everything the ancestors said is true, Ye Jun.  
 - For the peace of our family... 

90
00:04:54,756 --> 00:04:56,636
 Righteous management is... 

91
00:04:56,636 --> 00:04:58,235
Look at your uncle.

92
00:04:58,235 --> 00:05:02,936
He used to be a simple man who couldn't say anything he didn't mean.

93
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:06,675
Now, he's only speaking empty words without changing his expression

94
00:05:06,675 --> 00:05:08,776
when it's so easy to see through.

95
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:10,316
Sister-in-law.

96
00:05:10,316 --> 00:05:12,845
You must've had a hard time because of Soonyang Card.

97
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:14,681
 I will now... 

98
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:18,115
I guess I would be upset, too.

99
00:05:18,115 --> 00:05:21,055
You only have one thing to show off about your family.

100
00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:25,055
Your father, the former finance minister.

101
00:05:25,055 --> 00:05:28,195
But I heard even his position didn't work this time.

102
00:05:29,126 --> 00:05:34,098
Without your family as a fence, your bones ache even at this age.

103
00:05:34,098 --> 00:05:37,076
I'm so worried about you.

104
00:05:37,076 --> 00:05:41,246
Why are you so proud of your infamous loan shark family of Myeong-dong?

105
00:05:41,246 --> 00:05:45,975
He earns grubby money in the marketplace and the interest he charges makes people cry.

106
00:05:45,975 --> 00:05:49,415
Aren't you embarrassed at that age?

107
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:58,330
We used that dirty money to buy out all of Soonyang Corporation shares in the market

108
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,795
to turn my husband into the chairman of Soonyang Group.

109
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:05,796
Embarrassed? Me?

110
00:06:07,235 --> 00:06:10,905
In this case, the right word is "jealous," Sister-in-law.

111
00:06:10,905 --> 00:06:13,514
 I miss you yet again today, Father. 

112
00:06:18,446 --> 00:06:21,526
Is the bankruptcy announcement of Soonyang Card tomorrow?

113
00:06:21,526 --> 00:06:23,725
Yes, Chairman Jin.

114
00:06:25,256 --> 00:06:28,755
As soon as we receive two percent of the Corporation, I'll contact Fair Trade Commission,

115
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:32,395
and start the official process of making you the chairman of Soonyang Group.

116
00:06:32,396 --> 00:06:33,996
Chairman Jin.

117
00:06:43,776 --> 00:06:45,836
 Do I speak like this? 

118
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:50,125
 Grandfather always said... 

119
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:54,946
Once again, the group’s successor will be the eldest son.

120
00:06:54,946 --> 00:06:58,317
- My father, me, 
  - Instead of who owns it... 

121
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,155
and our son.

122
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,626
 I always keep that in mind, Grandfather. 

123
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:07,465
I kept my word.

124
00:07:07,465 --> 00:07:11,612
- Boast about it 
  - I will always do my best... 

125
00:07:11,612 --> 00:07:16,335
only after you become the chairman, okay?

126
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:48,265
Uncle, I heard you were going to give a speech at the end of the event as the family representative.

127
00:07:50,276 --> 00:07:53,835
Yes. As you said,

128
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:59,886
it's the speech of Soonyang's chairman that's worth 1.6 trillion won  ($1.6B) .

129
00:07:59,886 --> 00:08:05,786
I just got a call that the creditors of Soonyang Card finished their last meeting.

130
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:10,585
They say Soonyang Card will be normalized soon.

131
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:12,625
What?

132
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:17,795
The company that took over Soonyang Card must be financially strong.

133
00:08:17,795 --> 00:08:22,466
They already paid back the tremendous amount of debt.

134
00:08:22,466 --> 00:08:25,357
They paid back the debt?

135
00:08:25,357 --> 00:08:26,705
Yes.

136
00:08:27,346 --> 00:08:30,876
Then what about

137
00:08:30,876 --> 00:08:33,285
my shares of Soonyang Corporation?

138
00:08:33,285 --> 00:08:35,181
 I respect my older brother Young Ki... 

139
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,315
- I'm the most handsome one, right? 
  - And treat him as my elder. 

140
00:08:38,315 --> 00:08:41,685
 I'm living just for Soonyang. 

141
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:46,526
 We fill the gaps of each other 

142
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,726
 and work toward a better Soonyang. 

143
00:08:48,726 --> 00:08:52,406
Two percent of Soonyang Corporation shares was bait.

144
00:08:53,035 --> 00:08:59,035
It was bait to get both Hyungnim Young Ki and me with Soonyang Card.

145
00:09:01,945 --> 00:09:05,970
I thought Oldest Brother was going to win in a decision.

146
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,516
So?

147
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:10,016
Who is it?

148
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,536
The largest shareholder of Soonyang Corporation?

149
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,526
For the past year,

150
00:09:15,526 --> 00:09:19,995
the shares of Soonyang Corporation under Vice-Chairman Jin Young Ki increased quite a lot.

151
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,766
Was that your work?

152
00:09:27,736 --> 00:09:31,738
For CEO Jin Seong Jun's Soonyang Venture Investment which was unlisted,

153
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:35,175
you made it go public and earned seed money for him.

154
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:39,215
The shares of Soonyang Electronics kept increasing in capital.

155
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:44,555
I guess CEO Jin Seong Jun started the preparation

156
00:09:44,555 --> 00:09:47,216
for succession as well.

157
00:09:47,216 --> 00:09:51,396
I learned everything from you.

158
00:09:51,396 --> 00:09:54,195
Don't work too hard.

159
00:09:54,195 --> 00:09:58,465
In the end, you'll just become like me.

160
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,845
No way.

161
00:10:00,845 --> 00:10:03,103
I don't covet the owner's position.

162
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:08,403
Because your owner is not the owner of Soonyang.

163
00:10:10,315 --> 00:10:14,055
   

164
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:19,886
Because it is I, who designed the succession plan of Soonyang.

165
00:10:20,655 --> 00:10:26,356
When I delivered bread, I got quite a bit of breadcrumbs on my hands.

166
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:34,164
I passed my shares of Soonyang Corporation under borrowed names to the new owner that I chose.

167
00:10:34,165 --> 00:10:37,065
- What are you... 
 - That owner will become

168
00:10:37,065 --> 00:10:40,535
the largest shareholder of Soonyang Corporation.

169
00:10:42,888 --> 00:10:44,929
So who is it?

170
00:10:45,575 --> 00:10:48,546
Who is the largest shareholder of Soonyang Corporation?

171
00:10:50,955 --> 00:10:53,955
It's me, Uncle.

172
00:10:53,955 --> 00:10:55,855
What?

173
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,526
The person who took over Soonyang Card,

174
00:10:58,526 --> 00:11:02,126
and the person who paid the debt right after.

175
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:06,195
And the person who prevented the collateral of the two percent

176
00:11:06,195 --> 00:11:08,795
of Soonyang Corporation shares from falling into your hands.

177
00:11:09,766 --> 00:11:11,605
It's all me.

178
00:11:12,535 --> 00:11:14,659
You punk.

179
00:11:14,659 --> 00:11:18,476
Were you planning this from the start?

180
00:11:18,476 --> 00:11:23,415
You went between Dong Ki and me with the debt of 800 billion won  ($800M)  of the card company

181
00:11:23,415 --> 00:11:25,285
and made double the profit!

182
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:28,355
Twice, at that!

183
00:11:29,896 --> 00:11:33,396
Yes. I needed money.

184
00:11:36,026 --> 00:11:39,387
To take over the shares of Soonyang Corporation under borrowed names.

185
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:44,769
The largest shareholder of Soonyang Corporation...

186
00:11:49,246 --> 00:11:51,115
is me.

187
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:02,256
Welcome back.

188
00:12:11,366 --> 00:12:12,996
Seong Jun.

189
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,670
What happened that he looks so gloomy?

190
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,736
Nothing happened.

191
00:12:19,736 --> 00:12:22,205
He gave the speech for Grandfather's one-year memorial service.

192
00:12:22,205 --> 00:12:24,226
I'm sure he feels empty.

193
00:12:24,226 --> 00:12:27,396
He had a very strong sense of filial duty as a son.

194
00:12:28,386 --> 00:12:30,516
Mother, don't worry about Father.

195
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:31,955
Take an early rest today.

196
00:12:31,955 --> 00:12:34,026
You must be very tired from the event.

197
00:12:34,026 --> 00:12:36,086
- Go check on your father. 
 - Okay.

198
00:12:37,096 --> 00:12:40,466
Gosh, you're awake.

199
00:12:41,295 --> 00:12:42,825
Hello.

200
00:12:54,175 --> 00:12:58,246
You punk. Where are your manners?

201
00:12:58,915 --> 00:13:01,686
- Do I look like a pushover? 
 - Yes.

202
00:13:01,686 --> 00:13:04,015
Yes! Yes!

203
00:13:04,015 --> 00:13:09,526
For the past thirty years, I tried so hard not to think of you as a pushover.

204
00:13:09,526 --> 00:13:14,060
My gaze, words, and habitual actions.

205
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,998
In case any of them would show my honest thoughts of looking down on you,

206
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:22,405
I behaved very carefully.

207
00:13:22,405 --> 00:13:25,936
- Because I couldn't let Grandfather find out. 
 - What?

208
00:13:25,936 --> 00:13:29,575
"I cannot allow the succession of Soonyang go to a father whom even his own son looks down on."

209
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:35,775
You could never imagine how afraid I was at the thought

210
00:13:35,785 --> 00:13:39,016
of Grandfather suddenly announcing that.

211
00:13:43,325 --> 00:13:46,795
That's why you are relaxed enough to drink liquor even after Do Jun became

212
00:13:46,795 --> 00:13:48,996
the largest shareholder of Soonyang Corporation

213
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:51,556
and enjoy the feeling of being a loser.

214
00:13:51,556 --> 00:13:56,906
Even if Do Jun is now the largest shareholder, nothing changes.

215
00:13:56,906 --> 00:13:59,006
What can that punk do?

216
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:01,246
As long as I have the management rights,

217
00:14:01,246 --> 00:14:03,846
he can't even move the board of directors as he likes.

218
00:14:03,846 --> 00:14:06,746
The world has changed, Father.

219
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:11,555
The world where corporations exist to earn money for the owner is over.

220
00:14:11,555 --> 00:14:16,065
It's a world where darn stakeholders' rights and profit are more important.

221
00:14:16,065 --> 00:14:20,925
Do Jun will try to exercise all rights he has as the largest shareholder.

222
00:14:26,435 --> 00:14:28,665
- Fellow Korean Lad. 
 - CEO Oh.

223
00:14:28,665 --> 00:14:30,736
Why are you back in the office? Did something happen?

224
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:32,736
Are you guys getting off work now?

225
00:14:32,736 --> 00:14:36,246
We should get off work before 12 a.m. for the first time in two months.

226
00:14:36,246 --> 00:14:37,776
My family came to visit from the US.

227
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,776
I see.

228
00:14:39,776 --> 00:14:42,515
What's that in your hand?

229
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:44,586
Champagne?

230
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,655
It's a day worth celebrating.

231
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:52,056
I became the largest shareholder of Soonyang Corporation.

232
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:55,726
I'm fine.

233
00:14:55,726 --> 00:14:57,835
Don't mind me and go home.

234
00:14:57,835 --> 00:15:00,035
- Fellow Korean Lad. 
 - Yes.

235
00:15:00,035 --> 00:15:03,405
- So you knew how to celebrate. 
 - Sorry?

236
00:15:03,405 --> 00:15:07,746
I thought you lived each day as if you were catching up on homework.

237
00:15:07,746 --> 00:15:09,106
I see.

238
00:15:09,106 --> 00:15:13,346
Let's have a party after you get the management rights of Soonyang Corporation.

239
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:14,347
Let's do it then.

240
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:16,785
Sure thing. Goodbye.

241
00:15:19,915 --> 00:15:23,226
Don't tell me you're going to stay in the office like this.

242
00:15:23,226 --> 00:15:25,726
- Sorry? 
 - Don't do that. Call her.

243
00:15:25,726 --> 00:15:29,465
"It's a special day, so I want to drink champagne with you."

244
00:15:30,636 --> 00:15:34,036
There's someone you want to meet on a day like this, right?

245
00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:36,665
I'll be off first.

246
00:15:36,665 --> 00:15:38,776
- You can do it. 
 - Thank you.

247
00:15:38,776 --> 00:15:40,976
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

248
00:15:51,886 --> 00:15:55,086
   

249
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:15,060
♫   The darkened sky is coming down   ♫

250
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,950
♫   Resting against    ♫

251
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,724
It feels better 
 ♫   the scattering starlight   ♫

252
00:16:21,645 --> 00:16:23,680
to be alone.

253
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:29,830
♫   Rather than counting the times    ♫

254
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:34,740
♫   we walked    ♫

255
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,540
♫   toward a very distant place,    ♫

256
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:45,480
♫   I close my eyes.    ♫

257
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:55,220
♫   I imagine, you who are like a miracle   ♫

258
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:05,020
♫   I call, you who are like a dream   ♫

259
00:17:06,756 --> 00:17:09,266
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you. 
   ♫   Even if I lose my way in the dark night   ♫

260
00:17:09,266 --> 00:17:10,746
- Bye. 
 - Thank you.

261
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:12,070
You're welcome. 
 ♫   even if I can’t sleep for a long long night   ♫

262
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:19,700
♫   like a star in the night sky   ♫

263
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:27,720
♫   I’ll protect you forever   ♫

264
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:39,730
♫   The fluttering petals brush against me   ♫

265
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:49,580
♫   And the night is permeated by your smile   ♫

266
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:54,360
♫   Blown in by the wind   ♫

267
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,160
♫   that voice of yours   ♫

268
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:04,040
♫   shines brightly   ♫

269
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,730
♫   on the path I’ve been walking alone   ♫

270
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:15,360
♫   I imagine,  you who are like a miracle   ♫

271
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,395
   

272
00:18:17,395 --> 00:18:22,210
♫   Even the time I hesitated out of fear   ♫

273
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:27,460
♫   even the feelings that I turned a blind eye to    ♫

274
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,780
♫   it was always you   ♫

275
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:41,550
♫   now like the first time, this moment too.   ♫

276
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:43,156
Are you back now?

277
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,326
It's late.

278
00:18:45,326 --> 00:18:47,496
Were you still awake?

279
00:18:47,496 --> 00:18:51,666
I couldn't see you halfway through your grandfather's memorial service,

280
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:55,166
so I was worried that you left in a hurry because of work.

281
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:58,535
I thought you might be hungry, so I waited to cook for you.

282
00:18:58,535 --> 00:19:00,235
Go wash quickly.

283
00:19:09,186 --> 00:19:10,555
I'm sorry, Mother.

284
00:19:10,555 --> 00:19:13,578
You should sleep now. I'm good at cleaning up, too.

285
00:19:14,526 --> 00:19:17,956
Goodness. I know you're neat,

286
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:21,565
but sometimes I wondered

287
00:19:21,565 --> 00:19:25,966
whether I was raising a son or a boarder.

288
00:19:25,966 --> 00:19:28,165
Were you upset?

289
00:19:28,165 --> 00:19:30,706
I was worried.

290
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:36,905
I pray every day.

291
00:19:38,276 --> 00:19:42,245
For my neat and organized son

292
00:19:42,245 --> 00:19:48,256
to live with someone who can reach out to you as if it's nothing

293
00:19:48,256 --> 00:19:50,186
when you're having a tough time,

294
00:19:50,186 --> 00:19:56,566
and you can open up to them without becoming embarrassed.

295
00:20:01,173 --> 00:20:05,035
It will get cold. You must be hungry. Eat up.

296
00:20:05,035 --> 00:20:06,535
Okay.

297
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:11,315
Mother.

298
00:20:12,746 --> 00:20:14,415
I have someone.

299
00:20:14,415 --> 00:20:16,016
What?

300
00:20:17,156 --> 00:20:18,959
I met someone...

301
00:20:20,656 --> 00:20:22,625
like that.

302
00:20:27,503 --> 00:20:29,926
- He's here! 
 - That's him.

303
00:20:29,926 --> 00:20:32,096
Did the presidential candidate himself demand the funds?

304
00:20:32,096 --> 00:20:33,866
Did he promise something in return?

305
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,565
Do you admit to threatening companies to...

306
00:20:35,565 --> 00:20:39,735
 Prosecutors subpoenaed Sinmin Party's legal advisor lawyer Kang Sin Woo 

307
00:20:39,735 --> 00:20:44,346
 who collected illegal campaign funds from companies for the opposition. 

308
00:20:44,346 --> 00:20:48,286
The times are telling us to sever the unhealthy ties between politics and business

309
00:20:48,286 --> 00:20:53,155
to become more transparent and make a leap toward becoming a mature democracy.

310
00:20:53,155 --> 00:20:55,385
 The Ministry of Justice and the Prosecutors' Office 

311
00:20:55,385 --> 00:21:00,226
 promise the public we'll give our all to investigate the illegal campaign funds. 

312
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:03,566
 There is no political division when it comes to this matter. 

313
00:21:03,566 --> 00:21:05,936
 There will be no sacred ground either. 

314
00:21:05,936 --> 00:21:09,036
 All that there will be is the fair, 

315
00:21:09,036 --> 00:21:11,276
 and just fight for the truth. 

316
00:21:11,276 --> 00:21:14,276
 Minister of Justice Choi Chang Je invoked his authority, 

317
00:21:14,276 --> 00:21:18,516
 and expanded the illegal campaign fund investigation to include not just opposition, 

318
00:21:18,516 --> 00:21:21,586
 but most notable persons in politics and finance. 

319
00:21:21,586 --> 00:21:25,855
 Minister Choi voiced his determination to sever the ties of politics, 

320
00:21:25,855 --> 00:21:30,155
 and eliminate corruption through a stern investigation without limits. 

321
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:34,496
 Politicians and businessmen alike strongly oppose the investigation. 

322
00:21:34,496 --> 00:21:39,609
 It's to be seen whether Minister Choi can and will get his way. 

323
00:21:41,465 --> 00:21:43,135
Goodness, brother-in-law!

324
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:47,036
You came all this way at this time of day.

325
00:21:47,036 --> 00:21:50,575
To think we are summoning someone busy with matter of the nation.

326
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,845
What an honor it is.

327
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:56,345
I always come and go as you demand.

328
00:21:56,345 --> 00:21:58,915
It's been like that for the past thirty years.

329
00:21:58,915 --> 00:22:02,725
Uncle, we need to prepare to deal with the prosecutors, right?

330
00:22:02,725 --> 00:22:05,695
End it with a simple investigation behind closed doors.

331
00:22:05,695 --> 00:22:07,156
Shouldn't you do that much for our family?

332
00:22:07,156 --> 00:22:09,531
You should read the papers.

333
00:22:10,456 --> 00:22:15,435
I told the prosecution to investigate thoroughly and that there is to be no sanctuary.

334
00:22:15,435 --> 00:22:17,236
If I let your family off because you are my wife,

335
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:21,375
it's as good as an admission that prosecutors are not impartial. Don't you know that?

336
00:22:25,576 --> 00:22:27,486
You won't have to worry too much.

337
00:22:27,486 --> 00:22:30,516
Even if we find that you paid an exorbitant amount of money for the presidential campaign,

338
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:33,985
if you can make it look like an insurance policy without an incentive,

339
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:36,625
you can avoid any sentences.

340
00:22:39,496 --> 00:22:43,936
Oh, what the prosecutors will focus on is where the funds came from.

341
00:22:43,936 --> 00:22:47,036
How the funds were procured, and whether it was illegal.

342
00:22:47,036 --> 00:22:50,006
But no one hides that better than the Soonyang family.

343
00:22:50,006 --> 00:22:52,806
You're all experts at that.

344
00:22:59,315 --> 00:23:02,560
Chang Je. Wait.

345
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:06,315
I need to speak with you urgently.

346
00:23:06,315 --> 00:23:08,355
If it's about the investigation,

347
00:23:08,355 --> 00:23:11,326
what I just told you is all I can say.

348
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,765
Come on now, Chang Je.

349
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:19,866
Listen.

350
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:23,766
It's not about me, you see.

351
00:23:23,766 --> 00:23:27,076
I have this huge sense of guilt.

352
00:23:27,076 --> 00:23:30,375
As an uncle, I introduced my nephew

353
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:33,715
to a very bad person.

354
00:23:35,385 --> 00:23:37,855
 The opposing party's legal advisor Kang Sin Woo 

355
00:23:37,855 --> 00:23:39,916
 received 15 billion won  ($15M)  in cash from a large company 

356
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:42,385
 during the presidential campaign and passed it to... 

357
00:23:42,385 --> 00:23:45,623
We're from the Central Investigation Division.

358
00:23:46,455 --> 00:23:48,525
Are you Jin Do Jun?

359
00:23:48,525 --> 00:23:50,466
Yes. What can I do for you?

360
00:23:50,466 --> 00:23:54,765
You're under emergency arrest for the illegal payment

361
00:23:54,765 --> 00:23:57,736
of campaign funds to legal advisor Kang Sin Woo.

362
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:00,306
Can I have a look?

363
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:02,388
It's not a subpoena for an investigation

364
00:24:02,388 --> 00:24:03,706
but an arrest warrant?

365
00:24:03,706 --> 00:24:06,846
The prosecutor-in-charge issued one as you could destroy evidence,

366
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:09,486
or attempt to flee abroad.

367
00:24:15,055 --> 00:24:17,225
   

368
00:24:17,225 --> 00:24:19,695
   

369
00:24:19,695 --> 00:24:21,865
Mr. Jin Do Jun?

370
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:25,665
I'm Seo Min Yeong with the Central Investigation Bureau.

371
00:24:25,665 --> 00:24:27,565
Take a seat.

372
00:24:36,276 --> 00:24:40,445
We meet again like this,

373
00:24:42,616 --> 00:24:45,085
as a prosecutor and a suspect.

374
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:50,934
His arrest under exigent circumstances is a good sign for us.

375
00:24:50,934 --> 00:24:56,004
The investigation will keep Do Jun occupied for a while.

376
00:24:56,004 --> 00:24:59,166
It would be even better for us if he's found guilty and sentenced.

377
00:25:00,336 --> 00:25:05,505
The person who gave ten billion won  ($10M)  in funds to the opposition's likely winner.

378
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:07,876
Was it you, Jin Do Jun?

379
00:25:07,876 --> 00:25:11,145
You arrested me without a warrant.

380
00:25:13,246 --> 00:25:16,516
Doesn't that mean you already have proof I can't deny or refute?

381
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:18,895
I had you arrested under exigent circumstances

382
00:25:18,895 --> 00:25:23,125
because you'd likely destroy evidence or flee the country.

383
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:28,356
You helped a likely suspect who abetted murder go abroad once before.

384
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:37,336
That's Sinmin Party's legal advisor Kang Sin Woo's statement.

385
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:43,042
Through Miracle Investment's Director Jin Do Jun's personal assistant Ha In Seok,

386
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:46,045
he received ten billion won  ($10M)  in cash.

387
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:49,885
We found Ha In Seok's number in Advisor Kang's call history.

388
00:25:49,885 --> 00:25:52,651
In the Yeouido apartment basement-level parking lot

389
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:55,726
that Kang used as a rendezvous spot,

390
00:25:55,726 --> 00:25:59,055
we spotted Assistant Ha In Seok's car.

391
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:06,035
He was subpoenaed and is being questioned as a witness as we speak.

392
00:26:08,806 --> 00:26:13,476
Are you Miracle Investment's Assistant Manager Ha In Seok?

393
00:26:13,476 --> 00:26:14,440
Yes.

394
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,816
You're here to give a statement as a witness.

395
00:26:18,816 --> 00:26:20,745
I understand.

396
00:26:21,516 --> 00:26:24,116
Do you know Director Jin Do Jun?

397
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:25,139
Yes, I do.

398
00:26:25,139 --> 00:26:28,155
Did he instruct you to pass to Kang

399
00:26:28,155 --> 00:26:30,125
- any political funds? 
 - Assistant Manager Ha

400
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:34,395
will do anything you say.

401
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:39,395
Isn't this

402
00:26:39,395 --> 00:26:43,436
proof that you can't deny or refute?

403
00:26:45,175 --> 00:26:48,235
Did Assistant Ha In Seok say

404
00:26:48,235 --> 00:26:50,753
that I told him to give Legal Advisor Kang

405
00:26:50,753 --> 00:26:53,616
political funds?

406
00:26:57,986 --> 00:27:02,225
The people are raving about the investigation.

407
00:27:02,225 --> 00:27:05,696
If the prosecution finds Do Jun guilty,

408
00:27:05,696 --> 00:27:08,066
Miracle's plan to steal

409
00:27:08,066 --> 00:27:11,526
Soonyang's management rights will go bust.

410
00:27:12,335 --> 00:27:13,696
Would you be okay with that, CEO Oh?

411
00:27:13,696 --> 00:27:15,436
How would I be okay?

412
00:27:15,436 --> 00:27:20,305
That's why I rushed over. Out of regret and guilt.

413
00:27:22,806 --> 00:27:25,576
Soonyang Corporation's board members.

414
00:27:25,576 --> 00:27:27,615
This is an X-File of sorts on them.

415
00:27:27,615 --> 00:27:33,486
Use this as a weapon to replace the board members with people who are friendly to Miracle.

416
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:38,496
Can Soonyang Corporation find out you gave such advice?

417
00:27:38,496 --> 00:27:40,556
That's what I want.

418
00:27:40,556 --> 00:27:43,895
I want rumors to spread that the Soonyang brothers are fighting over management rights.

419
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:48,238
That way, Soonyang Corporation's stock price will skyrocket.

420
00:27:48,238 --> 00:27:51,770
Daeyoung Group's chairman's sons also fought,

421
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:55,305
and when their stock price rose, in just one month,

422
00:27:55,305 --> 00:27:58,155
they made 300 billion won  ($300M) . Do the math.

423
00:27:58,155 --> 00:28:02,355
How much more do you think we could make through Soonyang?

424
00:28:03,246 --> 00:28:05,985
- "We?" 
 - That profit.

425
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:10,186
You and I can split it.

426
00:28:10,186 --> 00:28:11,596
You make a nice profit,

427
00:28:11,596 --> 00:28:15,196
and with that, I'll buy Soonyang Corporation's shares.

428
00:28:17,366 --> 00:28:20,636
You really are as good at math as I heard.

429
00:28:21,606 --> 00:28:25,275
In the end, money is what makes the world turn.

430
00:28:26,175 --> 00:28:28,145
I think so, too.

431
00:28:28,145 --> 00:28:32,775
Okay! We should meet more often. You and I, real grown-ups.

432
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:35,985
Goodbye.

433
00:28:35,985 --> 00:28:39,585
When I first met Do Jun seven years ago,

434
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:43,722
the young man who was still in his teens said he'd buy Soonyang.

435
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,826
I should tell you why I risked my whole career

436
00:28:46,826 --> 00:28:53,135
to move to Korea based on that absurd statement.

437
00:28:53,135 --> 00:28:56,735
On the New York Stock Exchange, if companies are at a similar level,

438
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,905
and one is Korean, it goes for a lower price.

439
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,546
I know that much. It's called the Korea Discount.

440
00:29:02,546 --> 00:29:04,715
Then you must also know the reason,

441
00:29:04,715 --> 00:29:07,845
for the Korea Discount is because of conglomerates' succession rule.

442
00:29:07,845 --> 00:29:10,215
It's like selecting a national team athlete

443
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:13,153
based on the sole fact of whether their parents were medalists,

444
00:29:13,153 --> 00:29:16,358
regardless of how competitive they are

445
00:29:16,358 --> 00:29:18,256
in the international market.

446
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,056
What is it you want to say?

447
00:29:20,056 --> 00:29:23,626
Management ability isn't something that's passed down in the family.

448
00:29:23,626 --> 00:29:26,195
We want to show that in the Korean market.

449
00:29:26,195 --> 00:29:29,535
Mr. Do Jun and us, in the name of Miracle...

450
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:30,976
No.

451
00:29:30,976 --> 00:29:35,105
With Miracle's money, we have come this far.

452
00:29:35,105 --> 00:29:37,802
Because what keeps the world turning

453
00:29:37,802 --> 00:29:39,255
is money in the end.

454
00:29:39,255 --> 00:29:41,225
I wonder

455
00:29:41,225 --> 00:29:46,285
if you'll still have this swagger when Do Jun is sentenced.

456
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:50,155
Prosecutors' Investigation is under the control of Minister of Justice.

457
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:53,495
That same Minister of Justice

458
00:29:54,155 --> 00:29:55,726
is under the control of this finger.

459
00:29:57,365 --> 00:29:59,466
Right here.

460
00:30:04,835 --> 00:30:06,906
This is so humiliating!

461
00:30:06,906 --> 00:30:08,976
Didn't I warn you?

462
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:12,575
That the risk of disgrace is high today, and you should watch what you say.

463
00:30:12,575 --> 00:30:15,246
This is all your fault, Director Baek.

464
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:17,985
If I had ignored you and not bought Soonyang Card,

465
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:21,486
would I be humiliated by a guy from who knows where?

466
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:26,291
Your soul and divinity aren't as clear as they used to be.

467
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:32,626
Shouldn't you find a spring deep in some mountain, and reconnect with the spirits?

468
00:30:32,626 --> 00:30:38,766
The fund you invested in based on my fortune telling made the highest profit of its kind even this month, Mr. Vice-Chairman.

469
00:30:38,766 --> 00:30:44,175
I get why you trusted Director Baek so much up until now, Dad.

470
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:48,476
And why the fortunes you tell are so accurate.

471
00:30:49,116 --> 00:30:52,486
Your average rate of return is 200 percent.

472
00:30:52,486 --> 00:30:53,402
What?

473
00:30:53,402 --> 00:30:57,355
To ensure that profit, you've been embezzling.

474
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:05,295
   

475
00:31:06,943 --> 00:31:10,142
Sir, will you let me explain first?

476
00:31:10,766 --> 00:31:12,735
Director Baek.

477
00:31:12,735 --> 00:31:17,706
How about you foretell your own future now?

478
00:31:17,706 --> 00:31:21,916
Do you think I'll fire you or not?

479
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:25,656
I understand your point very well.

480
00:31:25,656 --> 00:31:28,725
You won't be able to avoid the legal repercussions.

481
00:31:28,725 --> 00:31:31,156
Keep that in mind.

482
00:31:35,666 --> 00:31:38,535
Here's one last piece of advice, Sir.

483
00:31:38,535 --> 00:31:42,135
This month's fortune shows scorn from a government office and betrayal.

484
00:31:42,135 --> 00:31:45,379
Beware the people around you and always be cautious.

485
00:31:46,075 --> 00:31:49,506
Scorn? Betrayal?

486
00:31:49,506 --> 00:31:50,906
I should believe that?

487
00:31:50,906 --> 00:31:53,416
I'm just a messenger.

488
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:56,486
You are the one who eventually determines your fate.

489
00:31:56,486 --> 00:32:01,115
Whether you believe me or not is utterly up to you.

490
00:32:02,356 --> 00:32:05,140
   

491
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:08,250
   
   

492
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:16,335
The Prosecutors' Office has never been so loved or supported by the public in all its history.

493
00:32:16,335 --> 00:32:21,636
As Minister of Justice and a one-time prosecutor, I am extremely proud.

494
00:32:21,636 --> 00:32:22,875
I owe it to you all.

495
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:24,645
This is our opportunity.

496
00:32:24,645 --> 00:32:29,375
If we're to build up on it, we need something to show for.

497
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:31,456
Something that'll convince the people

498
00:32:31,456 --> 00:32:36,826
that the Central Investigation Bureau really did take the plunge and investigated fairly and justly.

499
00:32:36,826 --> 00:32:40,395
I heard Soonyang's late chairman's grandson has been arrested.

500
00:32:40,395 --> 00:32:42,395
He is being investigated now.

501
00:32:42,395 --> 00:32:47,735
If you want to get a warrant issued within the 48 hours you have him...

502
00:32:47,735 --> 00:32:51,106
Gosh, you need to hurry then.

503
00:32:51,106 --> 00:32:52,975
Hang on.

504
00:32:54,336 --> 00:32:57,345
Drink this and speed up the investigation.

505
00:32:57,345 --> 00:32:59,545
Don't you complain I put your junior over you

506
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:03,746
because I offered her a beverage first.

507
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:11,052
And if you feel pressure because your suspect is related to me by marriage, don't.

508
00:33:11,052 --> 00:33:12,556
I understand.

509
00:33:12,556 --> 00:33:17,125
I want you to investigate thoroughly so there can be no suspicions.

510
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:20,165
Dig deep into anyone who's involved.

511
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:26,376
If anyone refuses to come in, call me immediately, okay?

512
00:33:26,376 --> 00:33:28,135
Yes, Sir.

513
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:32,576
I need to know where Ha In Seok went before and after that day.

514
00:33:32,576 --> 00:33:35,545
Get me a detailed timeline of whom he met.

515
00:33:35,545 --> 00:33:36,815
Okay.

516
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:40,418
So I can pinpoint who instructed the funds be transferred.

517
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:42,955
"Who instructed the transfer?"

518
00:33:42,955 --> 00:33:48,536
That means you think Jin Do Jun is not guilty.

519
00:33:51,165 --> 00:33:54,895
He's not the type to end up being investigated so easily.

520
00:33:54,895 --> 00:33:58,565
I get the idea he could've been set up.

521
00:34:10,946 --> 00:34:12,815
I found it, Ma'am.

522
00:34:12,815 --> 00:34:14,756
The person who instructed Ha In Seok to transfer the funds.

523
00:34:14,756 --> 00:34:17,156
   

524
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:21,495
This is security footage from Miracle Investment's basement.

525
00:34:21,495 --> 00:34:23,426
The boxes of cash Kang Sin Woo received.

526
00:34:23,426 --> 00:34:27,065
We got the face of the man who passed them to Ha In Seok.

527
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:32,565
Find this person, and bring him in.

528
00:34:56,395 --> 00:34:57,995
Hello?

529
00:34:58,895 --> 00:35:02,267
What? I understand.

530
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:05,835
Ma'am, you should go to the interrogation room.

531
00:35:05,835 --> 00:35:07,105
He said he'll confess.

532
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,806
That he told Ha In Seok to pass on the funds.

533
00:35:10,806 --> 00:35:13,345
He wants to confess everything.

534
00:35:16,446 --> 00:35:18,386
Why does he want to confess all of a sudden?

535
00:35:18,386 --> 00:35:20,955
He said he'll confess to all illegal acts.

536
00:35:20,955 --> 00:35:23,355
In return for leniency.

537
00:35:28,161 --> 00:35:34,401
You'll confess to telling Ha In Seok to pass on the illegal funds?

538
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:42,906
To pass the ten billion won  ($10M)  to Sinmin Party's advisor Kang Sin Woo.

539
00:35:42,906 --> 00:35:44,976
It was my request.

540
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:48,645
Was it with your own will to pass on the funds?

541
00:35:48,645 --> 00:35:50,186
Of course not.

542
00:35:50,186 --> 00:35:51,916
I obeyed my employer,

543
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:58,326
Soonyang Group's Vice Chairman Jin Dong Ki, and did as was told.

544
00:35:59,495 --> 00:36:01,295
I don't get it.

545
00:36:01,295 --> 00:36:03,725
Instead of Soonyang's numerous employees,

546
00:36:03,725 --> 00:36:06,805
you got Miracle's Director Jin's assistant to do the job?

547
00:36:06,805 --> 00:36:14,216
Ha In Seok was an informant Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki had sent to spy on Director Jin Do Jun.

548
00:36:14,216 --> 00:36:16,446
Since he started at Miracle and until now,

549
00:36:16,446 --> 00:36:21,616
whenever Vice Chairman Jin Dong Ki called, he would come to the office.

550
00:36:21,616 --> 00:36:24,015
Check the visitor log.

551
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,884
It should show when he came by.

552
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:33,255
Then the ten billion won  ($10M)  Assistant Ha In Seok passed on wasn't Jin Do Jun's money?

553
00:36:33,255 --> 00:36:37,625
Was it a slush fund Jin Dong Ki had stashed away?

554
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:49,336
This shows where the money came from.

555
00:36:50,545 --> 00:36:52,815
It's all as he said.

556
00:36:52,815 --> 00:36:58,049
Ha In Seok worked for Jin Dong Ki for five years as outsourced help.

557
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:03,756
There are also records of him visiting Jin Dong Ki late at night after being called.

558
00:37:03,756 --> 00:37:05,596
It's as you said, Ma'am.

559
00:37:05,596 --> 00:37:07,256
How did you know?

560
00:37:07,256 --> 00:37:09,065
That Jin Do Jun was set up.

561
00:37:09,065 --> 00:37:11,665
That he wouldn't have been brought in easily.

562
00:37:11,665 --> 00:37:16,105
You said you thought he was framed.

563
00:37:16,105 --> 00:37:19,166
He was set up,

564
00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:23,375
but I don't know by whom.

565
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:43,525
He's denying all the charges?

566
00:37:43,525 --> 00:37:47,096
He's just repeating what his lawyer said.

567
00:37:47,096 --> 00:37:49,536
Like a broken record.

568
00:37:50,304 --> 00:37:55,406
The situation is slightly different from the other businessmen we questioned.

569
00:37:55,406 --> 00:38:01,915
Other people can get off by pleading; they fear politicians and their power.

570
00:38:01,915 --> 00:38:04,386
But we can prove he used Soonyang Investment

571
00:38:04,386 --> 00:38:07,855
and Insurance's clients' accounts to create the slush fund.

572
00:38:07,855 --> 00:38:10,286
We even have a witness.

573
00:38:10,286 --> 00:38:13,955
This guy can't avoid being sentenced.

574
00:38:13,955 --> 00:38:16,225
How are the other companies different?

575
00:38:16,225 --> 00:38:19,265
How can political funds not have any incentive?

576
00:38:19,265 --> 00:38:23,468
Chairmen who give tens of billions won don't want anything in return?

577
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:27,136
Isn't that the equivalent of blind love?

578
00:38:27,136 --> 00:38:29,846
Love stories like that rarely exist nowadays.

579
00:38:29,846 --> 00:38:33,216
I bet people don't even donate with that mindset.

580
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:35,046
You're on edge.

581
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:39,756
Is it because you're not making progress with the grandson of the late Chairman Jin?

582
00:38:39,756 --> 00:38:42,015
When was he brought in?

583
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:56,665
Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki

584
00:38:56,665 --> 00:39:01,508
is stubbornly denying he had Ha In Seok pass on the funds.

585
00:39:01,508 --> 00:39:06,777
But the circumstances Director Baek told us about
 were all proven true.

586
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:12,315
I did consider you were set up.

587
00:39:12,955 --> 00:39:17,685
Ever since you stood before me as a suspect.

588
00:39:18,725 --> 00:39:20,756
I'm surprised.

589
00:39:22,265 --> 00:39:24,366
I thought you wouldn't believe me.

590
00:39:24,366 --> 00:39:27,291
I didn't say I believed you.

591
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:30,736
That means I haven't yet concluded

592
00:39:30,736 --> 00:39:34,306
if you were set up or if you did the setting up.

593
00:39:38,076 --> 00:39:40,446
My husband Dong Ki.

594
00:39:40,446 --> 00:39:43,414
What if he ends up in prison?

595
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:47,716
You know what he's like. He's too sensitive to survive that.

596
00:39:47,716 --> 00:39:50,355
Prison cells these days are like hotel suites.

597
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:55,256
Because of stupid human rights, our tax money is getting wasted.

598
00:39:55,256 --> 00:39:57,096
Brother-in-law.

599
00:39:57,096 --> 00:40:01,295
Thirty years ago, when life was hard, and things were worse,

600
00:40:02,835 --> 00:40:06,406
many people did time and survived just fine.

601
00:40:06,406 --> 00:40:11,145
Dong Ki didn't put together those funds on his own.

602
00:40:11,915 --> 00:40:15,485
Could you please give the President a call?

603
00:40:15,485 --> 00:40:21,255
He knows, and I know the opposing candidate got fives times more than what we gave him.

604
00:40:21,255 --> 00:40:23,986
I don't dare ask for a favor.

605
00:40:23,986 --> 00:40:27,191
Would you want to help us if you were him?

606
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:31,663
Tell Dong Ki that when the wind is harsh,

607
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:35,466
he should learn from the wisdom of reeds on how to lie low.

608
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:37,306
I will make sure to tell him that.

609
00:40:37,306 --> 00:40:42,375
That you have no intention of helping him.

610
00:40:59,756 --> 00:41:03,826
Sister-in-law, you must be so worried about your husband.

611
00:41:05,636 --> 00:41:07,866
I'm more worried about what's to come.

612
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:10,376
You never suffered a day in your life,

613
00:41:10,376 --> 00:41:13,385
and now you must care for an inmate husband.

614
00:41:14,036 --> 00:41:16,505
That's no easy feat.

615
00:41:16,505 --> 00:41:20,006
I've done it myself, and at least I was young at the time.

616
00:41:20,006 --> 00:41:23,145
Are you talking about jail time even before he stood trial?

617
00:41:23,145 --> 00:41:24,086
Why?

618
00:41:24,086 --> 00:41:27,716
You might as well pray he goes away!

619
00:41:33,656 --> 00:41:36,494
That's a mental illness too.

620
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:41,295
Everyone suffers every now and then, and she acts like the sky fell only on her.

621
00:41:44,466 --> 00:41:46,975
You did the right thing, Father.

622
00:41:46,975 --> 00:41:51,945
This investigation into what uncle did exposed all the slush funds he has.

623
00:41:51,945 --> 00:41:53,814
Once he coughs it all up,

624
00:41:53,814 --> 00:41:57,644
he won't dare to mess with you or try to steal your position again.

625
00:41:58,886 --> 00:42:01,756
You should take him back under your wing then.

626
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:06,496
Don't worry about us.

627
00:42:06,496 --> 00:42:10,565
We're fully prepared to deal with the prosecutors.

628
00:42:10,565 --> 00:42:12,336
All right.

629
00:42:14,036 --> 00:42:18,236
I can't get anything done without you, Seong Jun.

630
00:42:20,998 --> 00:42:25,268
What? Learn from the wisdom of the reeds?

631
00:42:29,545 --> 00:42:31,516
They want to use this as an opportunity

632
00:42:31,516 --> 00:42:34,315
to take me out of the management rights fight.

633
00:42:34,315 --> 00:42:36,254
You see, all this is...

634
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:39,926
Seong Jun is coaching him.

635
00:42:39,926 --> 00:42:41,996
What do you think the prosecutors are up to?

636
00:42:41,996 --> 00:42:44,595
The Central Investigation Bureau and Cheongwadae are on the same page.

637
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:47,695
They need a trophy, so they want to reform the conglomerates.

638
00:42:47,695 --> 00:42:52,127
Conglomerates such as Soonyang?

639
00:42:54,835 --> 00:42:57,545
If they need a trophy...

640
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:01,316
The bigger, the better. Right?

641
00:43:02,847 --> 00:43:08,385
Wouldn't you say Soonyang Corporation is the one that represents Soonyang Group?

642
00:43:09,855 --> 00:43:13,596
Okay. Keep me updated.

643
00:43:22,835 --> 00:43:24,605
I'm sorry to visit you so early in the morning, Vice Chairman.

644
00:43:24,605 --> 00:43:26,406
Something urgent has come up.

645
00:43:26,406 --> 00:43:27,905
I just received a call.

646
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:31,645
The prosecution has launched search and seizure operations against Soonyang Corporation.

647
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:37,116
Prosecutors are acting a little too late.

648
00:43:37,116 --> 00:43:41,255
Even if they raid the office, they won't find anything at the Corporation office.

649
00:43:41,255 --> 00:43:43,056
- Right, Seong Jun? 
 - Yes.

650
00:43:43,056 --> 00:43:45,426
Not the Soonyang Corporation office.

651
00:43:45,426 --> 00:43:48,556
They raided the loan sharks in Myeong-dong.

652
00:43:49,966 --> 00:43:52,126
- Myeong-dong? 
 - Yes, Sir.

653
00:43:53,735 --> 00:43:55,206
The loan sharks? Why?

654
00:43:55,206 --> 00:43:57,306
I think the prosecutors obtained info on the accounts

655
00:43:57,306 --> 00:44:00,036
and shares you bought under borrowed names through them.

656
00:44:00,036 --> 00:44:03,797
It looks like they also know you used the campaign fund to buy the bond.

657
00:44:03,797 --> 00:44:08,876
The warrant was issued for the office owned by Ms. Son's family.

658
00:44:08,876 --> 00:44:11,746
How did the prosecutors find out about them?

659
00:44:13,556 --> 00:44:15,886
 We used that dirty money 

660
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:24,395
 to buy out all of Soonyang Corporation shares in the market to turn my husband into the chairman. 

661
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:31,936
I'm so sorry, Seong Jun.

662
00:44:31,936 --> 00:44:34,036
This is all my fault.

663
00:44:34,036 --> 00:44:37,316
 The search and seizure operations have revealed that Soonyang Corporation 

664
00:44:37,316 --> 00:44:40,956
 used borrowed-name accounts set up through a loan shark... 

665
00:44:40,956 --> 00:44:42,786
Sister-in-law! Are you even a human?

666
00:44:42,786 --> 00:44:45,085
How could you do this to your family?

667
00:44:45,085 --> 00:44:47,556
Even if you do this, Soonyang will never become your husband's!

668
00:44:47,556 --> 00:44:50,656
 Earlier today, the prosecution 

669
00:44:50,656 --> 00:44:53,695
-They say blood is thicker than water. 
  - secured evidence that Soonyang... 

670
00:44:53,695 --> 00:44:57,165
But I suppose money flows in the veins of these conglomerate families.

671
00:44:57,165 --> 00:44:59,036
I mean, what is this? They're brothers.

672
00:44:59,036 --> 00:45:01,565
But thanks to Vice Chairman Jin Dong Ki's statement,

673
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:04,166
we could launch the investigation into Soonyang Corporation's slush fund.

674
00:45:04,166 --> 00:45:06,775
Why should we thank Vice Chairman Jin Dong Ki?

675
00:45:06,775 --> 00:45:08,505
It was all thanks to Director Jin Do Jun.

676
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:11,178
Because of his arrest, we were able

677
00:45:11,178 --> 00:45:15,478
to launch the investigation into Soonyang Group's slush fund.

678
00:45:15,478 --> 00:45:18,620
   

679
00:45:26,955 --> 00:45:29,635
You look like you've reached a conclusion.

680
00:45:31,196 --> 00:45:34,596
Was this all part of your plan from the start?

681
00:45:34,596 --> 00:45:38,466
To make us investigate Vice Chairmen Jin Young Ki and Jin Dong Ki,

682
00:45:38,466 --> 00:45:41,596
you deliberately fell into this trap.

683
00:45:43,477 --> 00:45:47,547
They have the prosecution, media, and even Cheongwadae on their side,

684
00:45:48,176 --> 00:45:50,685
whereas I'm all I've got.

685
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:55,256
Do you really have to do all this to take Soonyang's management rights?

686
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:04,726
Min Yeong, I've never once forgotten the reason I was born into this family,

687
00:46:04,726 --> 00:46:09,206
and who Vice-Chairmn Jin Young Ki, Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki, and Jin Seong Jun are to me.

688
00:46:09,206 --> 00:46:11,665
So you have no choice since you were born into the family?

689
00:46:11,665 --> 00:46:14,576
You'll do whatever it takes to make the company yours?

690
00:46:14,576 --> 00:46:16,775
You don't care if you're breaking or manipulating the law?

691
00:46:16,775 --> 00:46:18,575
You're wrong.

692
00:46:20,545 --> 00:46:24,315
It means I'll never live like that kind of conglomerate.

693
00:46:27,685 --> 00:46:29,985
You told me

694
00:46:30,924 --> 00:46:34,364
that I'd become even more dishonorable once I become the head of Soonyang.

695
00:46:35,795 --> 00:46:39,496
That's why we broke up. Am I right?

696
00:46:42,105 --> 00:46:44,306
Let's start over, Min Yeong.

697
00:46:47,806 --> 00:46:52,176
I promise you I won't get worse.

698
00:47:00,315 --> 00:47:03,726
The 48-hour period has now ended.

699
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:06,556
So you don't believe me.

700
00:47:07,426 --> 00:47:09,095
Fine.

701
00:47:10,065 --> 00:47:12,195
Don't believe me then.

702
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:15,335
Believe in luck instead.

703
00:47:28,476 --> 00:47:32,320
   

704
00:47:33,656 --> 00:47:41,586
When Jang Mi Ran wins the silver medal, let's meet again.

705
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:54,476
- Mr. Ha, are you all right? 
 - Yes.

706
00:47:54,476 --> 00:47:56,275
- This must've been stressful. 
 - No.

707
00:47:56,275 --> 00:47:58,825
This is my job. I get paid to do this, so don't worry.

708
00:47:58,825 --> 00:48:01,626
- Let's go. 
 - Yes, let's go.

709
00:48:03,216 --> 00:48:05,415
CEO Oh, you're here, too.

710
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:12,326
This isn't "Records of the Three Kingdoms." This is the 21st century.

711
00:48:12,326 --> 00:48:15,596
Sacrificing yourself to earn trust of the enemies? Seriously?

712
00:48:18,735 --> 00:48:22,665
 This is a man we've worked with since your grandfather's days. 

713
00:48:26,935 --> 00:48:28,736
 Call him. 

714
00:48:29,876 --> 00:48:32,176
   

715
00:48:40,216 --> 00:48:41,916
 Hello. 

716
00:48:41,916 --> 00:48:44,317
 I need to fax this to someone. 

717
00:48:45,116 --> 00:48:45,996
   

718
00:48:45,996 --> 00:48:47,656
 Sure. 

719
00:48:48,726 --> 00:48:51,995
   

720
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,380
 We received an anonymous letter about Director Baek's embezzlement. 

721
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:02,306
 In the near future, I plan to report to the prosecution 

722
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:05,876
 that Vice Chairman Jin Dong Ki has been setting up 

723
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:09,245
 an illegal slush fund, using dormant accounts 

724
00:49:09,245 --> 00:49:11,445
 at Soonyang Investment and Soonyang Insurance. 

725
00:49:11,445 --> 00:49:15,415
 Then Soonyang will do what they've always done. 

726
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:19,995
 They'll make you take the fall for everything, Director Baek. 

727
00:49:19,995 --> 00:49:25,433
 I'm giving you a chance to get out of it before they make a move. 

728
00:49:28,669 --> 00:49:33,709
Being Soonyang's largest shareholder doesn't mean we own it.

729
00:49:33,709 --> 00:49:38,606
We need the management rights to truly own Soonyang.

730
00:49:38,606 --> 00:49:43,145
Is it time for Minister Choi Chang Je to play his role?

731
00:49:44,615 --> 00:49:46,855
   

732
00:49:46,855 --> 00:49:48,485
What are you doing?

733
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,655
They were investigating the illegal campaign fund.

734
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:53,756
Why are they suddenly after Soonyang Group's slush fund?

735
00:49:53,756 --> 00:49:55,895
You see, Hyungnim.

736
00:49:55,895 --> 00:49:58,835
When you're critically ill,

737
00:49:58,835 --> 00:50:00,998
wondering where and how you contracted the disease

738
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,906
while doing nothing about it will just get you killed.

739
00:50:03,906 --> 00:50:07,176
You must undergo surgery or treatment first.

740
00:50:07,176 --> 00:50:11,906
I learned this at a summer Bible camp when I was young.

741
00:50:11,906 --> 00:50:17,085
After praying that he would offer his own child as a sacrifice if the Lord was angered,

742
00:50:17,085 --> 00:50:18,786
he killed a lamb instead.

743
00:50:18,786 --> 00:50:25,725
The blood gushing out of its neck helped appease the Lord's anger.

744
00:50:31,026 --> 00:50:34,295
The head of Soonyang shall stand in front of the cameras.

745
00:50:34,295 --> 00:50:36,406
He shall be on his knees in front of the entire nation,

746
00:50:36,406 --> 00:50:40,476
enduring all the humiliation and finger-pointing covered in blood,

747
00:50:40,476 --> 00:50:43,093
gushing out of his body.

748
00:50:43,093 --> 00:50:44,576
Yes.

749
00:50:47,246 --> 00:50:48,244
As you're already aware,

750
00:50:48,244 --> 00:50:52,415
the prosecution will summon those in charge of finance as witnesses.

751
00:50:52,415 --> 00:50:55,855
We should discuss it in advance so our story remains consistent.

752
00:50:55,855 --> 00:50:57,856
Is that really necessary?

753
00:50:57,856 --> 00:51:00,466
The Director of Finance should be held accountable.

754
00:51:00,466 --> 00:51:02,766
Right, Mr. Kim?

755
00:51:02,766 --> 00:51:06,235
Well, I'll be honored. It'll be like another star on my shoulder.

756
00:51:06,235 --> 00:51:09,200
However, public opinion won't approve of it.

757
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,906
The slush fund was created for the succession plans.

758
00:51:12,906 --> 00:51:16,106
Who'd believe that I called the shots?

759
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:20,016
Shouldn't calming public opinion be our priority at the moment?

760
00:51:20,016 --> 00:51:23,415
We need to show that the company is taking responsibility.

761
00:51:23,415 --> 00:51:26,446
Okay, so who should do it?

762
00:51:31,685 --> 00:51:34,026
Mr. Jin, if you step in and get things sorted out,

763
00:51:34,026 --> 00:51:37,965
the executives will no longer
be shaken up by this situation.

764
00:51:46,335 --> 00:51:48,935
Mr. Chairman, what are your thoughts on this?

765
00:51:48,935 --> 00:51:51,998
What could I do without you?

766
00:51:51,998 --> 00:51:59,130
So if one of us had to stand before the people to represent Soonyang,

767
00:52:00,486 --> 00:52:03,855
it should be you, Seong Jun, not me.

768
00:52:06,895 --> 00:52:09,725
Don't you agree, Seong Jun?

769
00:52:20,006 --> 00:52:23,806
"Saturn Devouring His Son."

770
00:52:25,076 --> 00:52:27,336
It's a painting by Francisco Goya.

771
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:31,545
Impressive, isn't it?

772
00:52:31,545 --> 00:52:35,085
The father in the painting heard a prophecy

773
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:39,586
that predicted he would be overthrown by his son.

774
00:52:39,586 --> 00:52:41,955
Of course, he didn't want to lose what he had.

775
00:52:41,955 --> 00:52:45,425
- That's why the father... 
 - So?

776
00:52:46,036 --> 00:52:48,496
Are you trying to say that I'm the son in this painting?

777
00:52:48,496 --> 00:52:50,365
Are you not?

778
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:55,605
Why are you showing me this painting right now?

779
00:52:55,605 --> 00:52:57,630
Are you getting a kick out of seeing me in this mess?

780
00:52:57,630 --> 00:52:58,655
Are you satisfied?

781
00:52:58,655 --> 00:53:02,326
Do you wish to display me in your gallery or something?

782
00:53:07,955 --> 00:53:14,254
I guess all you can see is the son getting eaten alive.

783
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:20,236
Were the succession plans why Soonyang Group set up the illegal slush fund?

784
00:53:20,236 --> 00:53:22,295
Soonyang Group is the number one company in Korea.

785
00:53:22,295 --> 00:53:25,136
What are your thoughts on the company working with a loan shark?

786
00:53:25,136 --> 00:53:29,176
 Some say that you'll be the one dealing with the legal consequences on behalf of Vice-Chairman Jin Young Ki. 

787
00:53:29,176 --> 00:53:30,676
What are your thoughts on this?

788
00:53:30,676 --> 00:53:31,545
   

789
00:53:31,545 --> 00:53:33,545
That is not true.

790
00:53:33,545 --> 00:53:36,845
 The person who should be held accountable for the slush fund... 

791
00:53:36,845 --> 00:53:38,686
   

792
00:53:38,686 --> 00:53:42,355
 Is my father, Vice Chairman Jin Young Ki. 

793
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:51,795
 My father told me that it was his duty to represent Soonyang. 

794
00:53:53,495 --> 00:54:00,365
I will follow his teachings and cooperate fully and faithfully with the investigation.

795
00:54:02,076 --> 00:54:05,146
- Are you denying responsibility... 
 - Do you not admit the charges?

796
00:54:05,146 --> 00:54:07,475
- Just a comment, please. 
 - What about the fund for...

797
00:54:07,475 --> 00:54:09,413
Later on, the father saves his son

798
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:12,786
whom he had swallowed, thanks to his children's wisdom.

799
00:54:12,786 --> 00:54:18,555
Then the son kills his father and ascends the throne.

800
00:54:19,196 --> 00:54:22,656
That's why I'm showing you this painting.

801
00:54:24,895 --> 00:54:27,295
What an ingrate.

802
00:54:28,636 --> 00:54:32,435
How dare you stab your father in the back?

803
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:36,976
You're no longer my son. Get out.

804
00:54:36,976 --> 00:54:39,005
Get out!

805
00:54:45,085 --> 00:54:50,215
Father, do you think you can protect Soonyang without me?

806
00:54:50,824 --> 00:54:55,606
Without the help from me and Grandfather, you would've struggled to keep your position.

807
00:54:56,485 --> 00:54:58,026
Just cooperate with the investigation,

808
00:54:58,026 --> 00:55:00,786
and transfer your shares to me when you have a moment.

809
00:55:01,835 --> 00:55:04,536
I'll handle Do Jun.

810
00:55:04,536 --> 00:55:07,735
You'll handle Do Jun?

811
00:55:07,735 --> 00:55:10,975
He thinks you're no match for him.

812
00:55:32,002 --> 00:55:35,610
   

813
00:55:38,565 --> 00:55:41,065
What happened at the board meeting?

814
00:55:41,065 --> 00:55:43,545
I am sorry, Sir.

815
00:55:45,205 --> 00:55:51,299
Seong Jun must be devastated.

816
00:55:59,495 --> 00:56:03,096
Here, Sir. You should see this.

817
00:56:04,566 --> 00:56:07,696
   
   

818
00:56:07,696 --> 00:56:09,435
 Board member Jin Do Jun of Miracle Investment, 

819
00:56:09,435 --> 00:56:11,136
 a third-generation member of the Soonyang family, 

820
00:56:11,136 --> 00:56:15,339
 has announced that he will be donating the entire 700 billion won  ($700M)  he inherited 

821
00:56:15,339 --> 00:56:18,006
 from Jin Yang Cheol, the late chairman of the company. 

822
00:56:18,006 --> 00:56:22,616
 Vice Chairman Jin Young Ki and Jin Dong Ki are currently facing severe public criticism 

823
00:56:22,616 --> 00:56:25,215
 due to the illegal slush fund and inheritance tax evasion, 

824
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:29,116
 so this could help the company win back public support. 

825
00:56:29,116 --> 00:56:32,156
 The news about board member Jin Do Jun's decision to donate the money he inherited 

826
00:56:32,156 --> 00:56:36,465
 is well received by the public, as a decision that showed the dignity of true wealth. 

827
00:56:36,465 --> 00:56:39,966
 His popularity among the public is also helping Soonyang Group improve its public image, 

828
00:56:39,966 --> 00:56:42,736
 contributing to the increase of the company's sales and stock price. 

829
00:56:42,736 --> 00:56:45,406
 Jin Do Jun, a third-generation member of the Soonyang Group family, 

830
00:56:45,406 --> 00:56:47,705
 has risen to fame as the icon of corporate reform. 

831
00:56:47,705 --> 00:56:51,076
 Everyone loves him, regardless of age or gender. 

832
00:56:51,076 --> 00:56:53,216
 Due to his popularity, Jin Do Jun of Miracle Investment, 

833
00:56:53,216 --> 00:56:55,676
 the largest shareholder of Soonyang Corporation, 

834
00:56:55,676 --> 00:57:00,116
 was appointed the next chairman of Soonyang Group 

835
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:02,386
 at the shareholders' meeting, which took place earlier today. 

836
00:57:02,386 --> 00:57:05,947
 His inauguration ceremony will take place on the fifth of next month. 

837
00:57:17,113 --> 00:57:21,630
   

838
00:57:29,816 --> 00:57:32,690
   

839
00:57:42,295 --> 00:57:49,196
I told you that I'd buy Soonyang no matter what.

840
00:57:52,339 --> 00:57:55,280
I kept my promise, Grandfather.

841
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:05,340
   

842
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:21,888
 I'm curious, Grandfather. 

843
00:58:22,866 --> 00:58:26,135
 Did I get my revenge? 

844
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:31,476
 Or can I finally call myself your grandson now? 

845
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:34,872
 But one thing's for sure. 

846
00:58:34,872 --> 00:58:41,399
 Right now, I miss you. 

847
00:58:43,555 --> 00:58:44,955
 Yes, she'll keep going. 

848
00:58:44,955 --> 00:58:47,495
- Yes. 
  - Round 3, 172.5. 

849
00:58:47,495 --> 00:58:48,656
 All right, Jang Mi Ran. 

850
00:58:48,656 --> 00:58:51,665
 This is Round 3. She'll go for 172.5kg this time. 

851
00:58:51,665 --> 00:58:52,895
 - Yes. 
 - Yes! 

852
00:58:52,895 --> 00:58:54,736
Oh, wait.

853
00:58:54,736 --> 00:58:57,506
Ma'am, I guess you didn't watch this last night.

854
00:58:57,506 --> 00:58:58,906
Yesterday, Jang Mi Ran already...

855
00:58:58,906 --> 00:59:00,876
Hush.

856
00:59:03,776 --> 00:59:11,175
 When Jang Mi Ran wins the silver medal, let's meet again. 

857
00:59:11,845 --> 00:59:14,215
 Nice. She can totally do this. 

858
00:59:14,215 --> 00:59:16,416
 That's it. Now, the jerk. 

859
00:59:16,416 --> 00:59:18,426
 Yes! She got it! 

860
00:59:18,426 --> 00:59:21,026
 - She got it! 
 - She did it! 

861
00:59:21,026 --> 00:59:24,195
 - Yes! 
 - She did it. 

862
00:59:24,195 --> 00:59:30,445
 When she participates in the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics, let's get married. 

863
00:59:32,565 --> 00:59:36,145
 By the time she's participating in the London 2012 Summer Olympics... 

864
00:59:36,145 --> 00:59:38,376
 Yes. 

865
00:59:38,376 --> 00:59:41,216
 We'd probably have a child by then, right? 

866
00:59:48,915 --> 00:59:52,526
 I want to stay right by your side like that, Min Yeong. 

867
00:59:55,556 --> 00:59:57,596
 Let's do that. 

868
01:00:09,705 --> 01:00:12,145
It's time to meet, right?

869
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:14,976
Yes.

870
01:00:14,976 --> 01:00:17,886
Just wait there, Min Yeong. I'm on my way.

871
01:00:31,233 --> 01:00:33,355
Should we go around it?

872
01:00:34,695 --> 01:00:38,605
Oh, I guess there's something wrong with the car.

873
01:00:39,536 --> 01:00:41,105
Let's wait a few moments.

874
01:00:41,105 --> 01:00:43,136
Yes, Sir.

875
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:15,321
 The rule had no exceptions. 

876
01:01:16,376 --> 01:01:22,356
 Everything that happened in my previous life happened again in this lifetime, 

877
01:01:23,645 --> 01:01:26,346
 without exception. 

878
01:01:29,685 --> 01:01:31,456
 And... 

879
01:01:35,938 --> 01:01:43,338
 the person who killed me was none other than myself. 

880
01:01:51,476 --> 01:01:56,620
   

881
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:06,010
