1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:10,010


2
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,240
 (Speaking foreign language) 

3
00:00:32,485 --> 00:00:37,295
I'll do it if you're not in a hurry.
 (Speaking Turkish) 

4
00:00:37,295 --> 00:00:40,369
How do you feel?

5
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:43,164
Do you remember anything?

6
00:00:43,164 --> 00:00:46,035
Can you remember your name?

7
00:00:46,035 --> 00:00:48,305
You will be fine.

8
00:00:48,305 --> 00:00:51,375
- Don't move. 
 - Don't move.

9
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:55,974
- Don't move. 
 - Stop.

10
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,514
Mr. Yoon Hyeon Woo?

11
00:02:22,624 --> 00:02:25,635
You remember me, right?

12
00:02:27,635 --> 00:02:29,804
We've met before.

13
00:02:29,804 --> 00:02:32,075
I hope you at least remember my face...

14
00:02:32,075 --> 00:02:34,975
because I saved you, Mr. Yoon Hyeon Woo,

15
00:02:34,975 --> 00:02:37,075
although you probably had no idea.

16
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:44,185
I know who you are.

17
00:02:46,784 --> 00:02:48,984
The Seoul District Public Prosecutors' Office.

18
00:02:50,955 --> 00:02:53,295
Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong.

19
00:03:05,175 --> 00:03:07,004
Hey, Hyeon Min.

20
00:03:08,145 --> 00:03:09,705
Yes.

21
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:13,475
Sorry. Things suddenly got busy here.

22
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:18,155
Yes. Father?

23
00:03:19,885 --> 00:03:22,185
You don't need to put him on the phone.

24
00:03:22,185 --> 00:03:24,755
I'll come by and say hi when I'm back in Korea.

25
00:03:24,755 --> 00:03:28,064
Yes. All right.

26
00:03:31,334 --> 00:03:32,834
Wait, Hyeon Min.

27
00:03:33,664 --> 00:03:35,064
Yes.

28
00:03:35,664 --> 00:03:40,504
Can you tell Father that I'm doing well here?

29
00:03:40,505 --> 00:03:43,915
Tell him not to worry about me.

30
00:03:43,915 --> 00:03:48,445
Let him know that I'll make sure to visit him when I'm back.

31
00:03:50,515 --> 00:03:52,815
Okay, all right.

32
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,320
   

33
00:04:07,635 --> 00:04:09,105
One's your plane ticket,

34
00:04:09,105 --> 00:04:10,705
and the other one is your emergency passport

35
00:04:10,705 --> 00:04:12,474
issued by the Korean consulate.
   

36
00:04:12,474 --> 00:04:14,174
Check the details.

37
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:18,260
I'll go downstairs and find out if you're ready to be discharged.

38
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,684
Prosecutor Seo.

39
00:04:24,484 --> 00:04:26,085
Here.

40
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,955
Thank you.

41
00:04:35,594 --> 00:04:38,094
I've never seen that look on your face before.

42
00:04:38,094 --> 00:04:41,034
"I will never let my guard down."

43
00:04:41,034 --> 00:04:44,435
You looked as though you were clad in a full suit of steel armor.

44
00:04:44,435 --> 00:04:48,685
But right now, you look like you've completely let your guard down.

45
00:04:50,115 --> 00:04:53,414
Why? Do I make you uncomfortable?

46
00:04:53,414 --> 00:04:56,814
Are you worried that I'd make you repay me for saving your life?

47
00:04:58,854 --> 00:05:00,725
Don't worry.

48
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:05,755
I didn't do it for you. In fact, I did it for myself.

49
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:10,995
I really need your testimony.

50
00:05:15,604 --> 00:05:19,334
That's why I reached out to the agents

51
00:05:19,334 --> 00:05:23,145
at the National Intelligence Service to help me track you down.

52
00:05:23,145 --> 00:05:28,214
Thanks to them, I was able to witness the incident and save you.

53
00:05:28,214 --> 00:05:31,354
Did you say you needed my testimony?

54
00:05:35,055 --> 00:05:36,855
Chairman Jin Young Ki.

55
00:05:36,855 --> 00:05:40,725
I plan to indict him for unlawful business succession.

56
00:05:40,725 --> 00:05:45,394
Since you're the Senior Finance Manager of Soonyang Group,

57
00:05:45,394 --> 00:05:49,104
the court will no longer be able to say there's insufficient evidence

58
00:05:49,104 --> 00:05:51,275
once you testify.

59
00:05:52,075 --> 00:05:55,474
You're here to take care of things for Soonyang's paper company, right?

60
00:05:55,474 --> 00:05:57,915
To be more accurate, you're here because of Soonyang's slush fund,

61
00:05:57,915 --> 00:05:59,784
which was created through illegal activities

62
00:05:59,784 --> 00:06:03,714
such as tax evasion and diverting funds to offshore accounts.

63
00:06:03,714 --> 00:06:08,724
That slush fund was connected to the company's succession process, right?

64
00:06:09,695 --> 00:06:11,294
I thought

65
00:06:11,995 --> 00:06:15,095
you could only interrogate people in the interrogation room.

66
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,794
Let me rephrase my question.

67
00:06:21,635 --> 00:06:23,205
Who was it?

68
00:06:25,904 --> 00:06:28,444
Whom? And why did someone

69
00:06:28,444 --> 00:06:32,674
try to kill you when you came here to withdraw the slush fund?

70
00:06:32,674 --> 00:06:36,044
Do you know, Mr. Yoon?

71
00:06:47,664 --> 00:06:49,295
Prosecutor Seo.

72
00:06:50,794 --> 00:06:54,605
I never question the owner family's orders.

73
00:06:54,605 --> 00:06:59,075
I can neither decline nor judge them.

74
00:07:01,145 --> 00:07:04,774
No matter the situation and no matter what it entails,

75
00:07:04,774 --> 00:07:06,574
I do

76
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,344
what I'm told to do

77
00:07:09,344 --> 00:07:11,454
because that's my job.

78
00:07:12,484 --> 00:07:16,584
So how far have you gone?

79
00:07:21,294 --> 00:07:23,165
You said you never questioned

80
00:07:23,165 --> 00:07:27,234
or judged the owner family's orders.

81
00:07:27,234 --> 00:07:31,105
How far such a loyal man like you go for your master?

82
00:07:31,105 --> 00:07:33,005
I'm curious.

83
00:07:36,474 --> 00:07:40,015
   

84
00:07:42,145 --> 00:07:44,315
   

85
00:07:47,154 --> 00:07:49,255
Mr. Yoon Hyeon Woo?

86
00:07:49,255 --> 00:07:51,325
Yes. Who are you?

87
00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:54,755
We're from the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office.

88
00:07:55,924 --> 00:07:58,064
I'm Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong from the Central Office.

89
00:07:58,064 --> 00:08:01,005
He is an important witness in a case I'm investigating.

90
00:08:01,005 --> 00:08:02,365
What is this about?

91
00:08:02,365 --> 00:08:05,404
Mr. Yoon Hyeon Woo, we have a warrant for your arrest.

92
00:08:05,404 --> 00:08:07,104
You're under arrest for embezzlement according to

93
00:08:07,104 --> 00:08:09,774
the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes.

94
00:08:09,774 --> 00:08:11,015
Embezzlement?

95
00:08:11,015 --> 00:08:13,444
We received a report that you embezzled

96
00:08:13,444 --> 00:08:15,944
the 700 billion won  ($700M)  from the sale of Soonyang Micro.

97
00:08:15,944 --> 00:08:17,414
No way. That money was...

98
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,824
We looked into it and found the 700 billion won  ($700M) 

99
00:08:19,824 --> 00:08:22,654
in your personal bank account.

100
00:08:22,654 --> 00:08:25,294
May I see the warrant?

101
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:29,624
   

102
00:08:36,105 --> 00:08:37,505
Darn it.

103
00:08:38,674 --> 00:08:40,374
Get him!

104
00:08:51,885 --> 00:08:53,285
It's that way.

105
00:09:07,265 --> 00:09:11,375
Excuse me, Sir. May I borrow your phone?

106
00:09:13,105 --> 00:09:15,374
Hyung, where are you?

107
00:09:15,374 --> 00:09:18,015
 Do you know who's here now? 

108
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:32,355
They said they were from Soonyang. The internal affairs department.

109
00:09:32,355 --> 00:09:34,464
 They told me you embezzled some kind of company fund 

110
00:09:34,464 --> 00:09:37,335
 and that there was an arrest warrant issued against you. 

111
00:09:37,335 --> 00:09:39,635
What is going on?

112
00:09:39,635 --> 00:09:41,505
Hyeon Min.

113
00:09:41,505 --> 00:09:44,304
I need your help.

114
00:10:00,585 --> 00:10:03,184
Wait! My goodness.

115
00:10:03,184 --> 00:10:05,395
Here. Oh, dear.

116
00:10:05,395 --> 00:10:07,924
It's pouring.

117
00:10:07,924 --> 00:10:11,434
Mr. Yoon. If you hear from your son tomorrow,

118
00:10:11,434 --> 00:10:13,665
you have to call us right away.

119
00:10:13,665 --> 00:10:16,365
He should talk to the company before the prosecutors get to him.

120
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:19,975
That way, we can help him avoid criminal punishment.

121
00:10:19,975 --> 00:10:23,844
I feel bad that you're doing all this to help my son.

122
00:10:24,645 --> 00:10:27,584
I apologize. I'm really sorry.

123
00:10:28,385 --> 00:10:32,154
Please put in a good word for him when you're back at the office.

124
00:10:32,154 --> 00:10:35,125
My son would never touch the company's money,

125
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,324
and such a huge amount at that.

126
00:10:37,324 --> 00:10:39,495
You see, my son...

127
00:10:39,495 --> 00:10:42,624
When all his peers were busy studying,

128
00:10:43,965 --> 00:10:45,694
he had to be the breadwinner in the family

129
00:10:45,694 --> 00:10:48,094
instead of me, his incompetent father.

130
00:10:48,765 --> 00:10:53,135
If he was capable of being selfish and greedy,

131
00:10:53,135 --> 00:10:55,045
he would've run away a long time ago.

132
00:10:55,045 --> 00:10:57,745
Mr. Yoon, we already told you everything.

133
00:10:57,745 --> 00:11:00,615
The evidence must be false. My son would never do such a thing.

134
00:11:00,615 --> 00:11:03,554
I swear, Hyeon Woo would never do such a thing.

135
00:11:03,554 --> 00:11:05,985
Wait, please help him.

136
00:11:05,985 --> 00:11:08,454
- Put in a good word for him. 
 - Goodness.

137
00:11:08,454 --> 00:11:10,854
Please put in a good word for him.

138
00:11:10,854 --> 00:11:12,554
Please.

139
00:11:13,664 --> 00:11:15,265
Please help him.

140
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,794
Please, I beg you.

141
00:11:20,235 --> 00:11:21,735
Please help him.

142
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:35,140
♫&nbsp; When everyone in the world turned their back on me and abandoned me, even&nbsp;in those times &nbsp;♫

143
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,645
Father.

144
00:11:39,354 --> 00:11:41,954
Why are you standing in the rain? What if you catch a cold?

145
00:11:41,954 --> 00:11:46,724
Oh, I was... I'm sorry.

146
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,460
♫&nbsp; Even if I walk through the&nbsp;fire, I won’t be afraid &nbsp;♫

147
00:11:50,465 --> 00:11:51,995
Hyeon Woo hyung.

148
00:11:52,794 --> 00:11:54,894
Here's what you asked for.

149
00:11:56,235 --> 00:11:57,735
And...

150
00:11:59,475 --> 00:12:02,874
You should take my phone. You'll need a phone.

151
00:12:03,444 --> 00:12:05,715
Okay, thanks.

152
00:12:08,245 --> 00:12:09,745
Father.

153
00:12:10,554 --> 00:12:13,915
Don't bow to others because of me.

154
00:12:13,915 --> 00:12:20,840
♫&nbsp; You are wonderful to me, ooh &nbsp;♫

155
00:12:25,294 --> 00:12:26,944
I have to go, Father.

156
00:12:28,835 --> 00:12:30,365
Bye.

157
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:35,110
♫&nbsp; When I feel alone,  ♫

158
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:41,340
♫&nbsp;  when I want to collapse, at times like that. &nbsp;♫

159
00:12:49,554 --> 00:12:51,654
Good work today.

160
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,974
Team Leader Yoon.

161
00:13:08,304 --> 00:13:10,644
What are you doing here?

162
00:13:11,615 --> 00:13:13,215
Director Kim.

163
00:13:14,714 --> 00:13:17,314
I must right the wrong.

164
00:13:20,755 --> 00:13:24,455
Life is such an interesting game.

165
00:13:24,455 --> 00:13:27,225
You can never predict anything.

166
00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:32,124
When Vice Chairman Jin Seong Jun ditched me and chose you,

167
00:13:32,124 --> 00:13:34,934
I thought you'd end up becoming

168
00:13:34,934 --> 00:13:38,084
Soonyang Group's very first executive without a college degree.

169
00:13:38,635 --> 00:13:40,634
What on earth

170
00:13:41,804 --> 00:13:44,274
did I do wrong?

171
00:13:47,115 --> 00:13:49,814
I went there to withdraw the slush fund

172
00:13:49,814 --> 00:13:52,514
as per Vice Chairman Jin Seong Jun's orders,

173
00:13:53,154 --> 00:13:55,654
and I faithfully carried out the orders.

174
00:13:55,654 --> 00:13:57,325
So why...

175
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,925
Why did I nearly get killed like that?

176
00:14:04,834 --> 00:14:07,635
I've been racking my brain, but I really don't understand.

177
00:14:07,635 --> 00:14:10,305
You, Mr. Yoon...

178
00:14:11,104 --> 00:14:13,254
Shouldn't you know better by now?

179
00:14:15,474 --> 00:14:19,074
Do you still not know what the Soonyang family is capable of?

180
00:14:23,814 --> 00:14:26,924
   

181
00:14:28,985 --> 00:14:30,625
   

182
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:34,665
I bet they wanted to conceal the illegal slush fund.

183
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,925
They can certainly hide it if you're gone, you know.

184
00:14:38,925 --> 00:14:42,104
Then Vice Chairman Jin Seong Jun can say that

185
00:14:42,104 --> 00:14:46,104
he inherited Soonyang in a lawful, transparent manner as he proclaimed

186
00:14:47,944 --> 00:14:50,974
and deceive the world.

187
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,155
The truth is,

188
00:14:59,155 --> 00:15:04,654
you weren't sent there to collect the slush fund as the company's Senior Finance Manager.

189
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,064
You were sent there as the owner family's butler

190
00:15:07,064 --> 00:15:09,995
and as the Jin family's servant

191
00:15:09,995 --> 00:15:14,935
to take the fall for the illegal fund of 700 billion won  ($700M). 

192
00:15:17,735 --> 00:15:21,104
That's why Vice Chairman Jin needed you.

193
00:15:21,104 --> 00:15:23,344
That was the only reason.

194
00:15:29,944 --> 00:15:33,315
That's why I need you to fix it.

195
00:15:34,785 --> 00:15:38,654
If only I hadn't met you twenty years ago,

196
00:15:40,765 --> 00:15:44,025
I wouldn't have come this far.

197
00:15:46,805 --> 00:15:52,204
You brought this upon yourself.

198
00:15:52,204 --> 00:15:58,274
If you never told Vice Chairman Jin about the Soonyang Micro ledger,

199
00:16:00,115 --> 00:16:04,484
we wouldn't be talking here like this now.

200
00:16:13,894 --> 00:16:16,964
I suggest you just give up.

201
00:16:16,964 --> 00:16:20,495
If Jin Seong Jun is the one you're going up against,

202
00:16:20,495 --> 00:16:22,935
you won't get your revenge.

203
00:16:24,975 --> 00:16:28,425
After all, revenge isn't for those who have been wronged.

204
00:16:29,705 --> 00:16:32,744
Only those with power can take revenge.

205
00:16:34,245 --> 00:16:37,415
Who's here at this hour?

206
00:16:37,415 --> 00:16:40,414
The door is open. Come on in.

207
00:16:44,154 --> 00:16:46,725
Sir, what's the matter?

208
00:16:47,565 --> 00:16:48,565
Go that way.

209
00:16:48,565 --> 00:16:50,315
 Yes, Sir. 

210
00:16:51,664 --> 00:16:55,464
The suspect in the Soonyang Corporation embezzlement case, Yoon Hyeon Woo.

211
00:16:55,464 --> 00:16:57,904
We've put out an APB on him

212
00:16:57,904 --> 00:17:01,345
but haven't been able to track him down yet.

213
00:17:01,345 --> 00:17:05,015
If he embezzled 700 billion won  ($700M), 

214
00:17:05,015 --> 00:17:08,085
he'll rot in jail for at least twenty years.

215
00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:09,485
What do you mean?

216
00:17:09,485 --> 00:17:11,285
He pocketed 700 billion won, so...

217
00:17:11,285 --> 00:17:14,054
No, I'm asking you about the 700 billion won.

218
00:17:14,054 --> 00:17:17,095
Why are you saying Yoon Hyeon Woo pocketed the money?

219
00:17:17,095 --> 00:17:20,195
He sent the money from the sale of the paper company

220
00:17:20,195 --> 00:17:22,395
to his own account and withdrew the whole thing in cash.

221
00:17:22,395 --> 00:17:26,124
- Are you sure? 
 - All embezzlers conceal the money they took.

222
00:17:26,124 --> 00:17:30,504
The Eastern Office is convinced that he embezzled the money.

223
00:17:30,504 --> 00:17:33,504
Why would he run away if he has nothing to hide?

224
00:17:34,474 --> 00:17:37,004
- Get going first. 
 - All right.

225
00:17:39,075 --> 00:17:41,675
Yes, Seo Min Yeong speaking.

226
00:17:46,215 --> 00:17:48,485
I'm here to turn myself in.

227
00:17:50,894 --> 00:17:55,565
You said you wanted to indict Chairman Jin Young Ki and his son.

228
00:17:56,364 --> 00:18:00,395
They set up an illegal slush fund through Soonyang Micro.

229
00:18:01,334 --> 00:18:03,134
I'm here to submit evidence to back it up.

230
00:18:03,134 --> 00:18:05,305
You came too late.

231
00:18:05,305 --> 00:18:08,245
You're a suspect now.

232
00:18:08,245 --> 00:18:11,275
You're suspected of embezzling that slush fund.

233
00:18:11,275 --> 00:18:15,144
So do you think it can serve as evidence?

234
00:18:15,815 --> 00:18:17,745
That money.

235
00:18:17,745 --> 00:18:19,654
To whom did you send it?

236
00:18:20,355 --> 00:18:23,984
You withdrew the 700 billion won  ($700M)  in cash.

237
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,424
Had I taken that money,

238
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:33,664
I wouldn't have come here voluntarily, knowing the risks.

239
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,775
At the hospital, you asked me

240
00:18:38,775 --> 00:18:41,435
who tried to kill me, why they did it,

241
00:18:41,435 --> 00:18:45,125
and if I knew how it was connected to the slush fund.

242
00:18:49,514 --> 00:18:52,714
The person who needed the 700 billion won

243
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,305
without the name Soonyang Micro.

244
00:18:56,924 --> 00:18:59,295
To siphon off the money,

245
00:19:00,154 --> 00:19:04,304
that person ordered Assistant Manager Shin Gyeong Min to kill me.

246
00:19:04,304 --> 00:19:08,615
Assistant Manager Shin Gyeong Min? I suppose he works for Soonyang.

247
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:09,805
Then first,

248
00:19:10,605 --> 00:19:12,075
let's find him.

249
00:19:12,075 --> 00:19:15,174
This is an attempted murder case, not an embezzlement case.

250
00:19:15,174 --> 00:19:17,714
And you're the victim, not a suspect.

251
00:19:21,444 --> 00:19:25,584
Is that why you're here? Because you feel wronged?

252
00:19:27,585 --> 00:19:29,084
No.

253
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,795
I'm here because I need power.

254
00:19:34,865 --> 00:19:38,525
Someone told me that revenge is for those with power,

255
00:19:38,525 --> 00:19:40,694
not those who have been wronged.

256
00:19:51,744 --> 00:19:56,314
I just sent you a detailed statement for the slush fund, which I had backed up to the cloud.

257
00:20:10,325 --> 00:20:13,664
I also sent you the files on everything I've worked on

258
00:20:13,664 --> 00:20:17,064
at Soonyang, including the ones for owner risk management.

259
00:20:17,974 --> 00:20:21,345
I've done everything I could.

260
00:20:22,275 --> 00:20:25,545
"It's all on you now."

261
00:20:25,545 --> 00:20:27,944
"Let's see how far you can go."

262
00:20:27,944 --> 00:20:30,315
That's what your face is telling me now.

263
00:20:32,785 --> 00:20:35,925
I don't doubt that you can pull it off.

264
00:20:36,654 --> 00:20:40,395
I know very well that you're Soonyang's Grim Reaper.

265
00:20:44,735 --> 00:20:50,304
I heard the security team was called to your house last night.

266
00:20:53,404 --> 00:20:56,274
I was just about to bring it up.

267
00:20:56,274 --> 00:20:58,614
You beat me to it.

268
00:20:58,614 --> 00:21:01,784
I was one step behind.

269
00:21:01,784 --> 00:21:04,954
I heard it was the employee they'd sent to collect the slush fund.

270
00:21:04,954 --> 00:21:09,354
I also heard Internal Affairs reported him for embezzling the fund.

271
00:21:09,354 --> 00:21:16,324
Would it be okay if your sources reported these things to me first?

272
00:21:16,324 --> 00:21:21,795
Now that you've changed lanes, it's time to pick up the pace.

273
00:21:21,795 --> 00:21:26,104
When that happened last night, you should've called me instead of Soonyang's security team.

274
00:21:26,104 --> 00:21:31,074
I bet that employee is Seong Jun oppa's Achilles' heel.

275
00:21:31,074 --> 00:21:33,675
We should've won him over to our side.

276
00:21:33,675 --> 00:21:35,415
I'm sorry.

277
00:21:35,415 --> 00:21:38,265
Before the shareholders' meeting takes place,

278
00:21:38,265 --> 00:21:41,614
we must get Seong Jun oppa ousted no matter what.

279
00:21:43,154 --> 00:21:45,954
Only then will I get an opportunity.

280
00:21:47,054 --> 00:21:51,494
Do not forget what I said.

281
00:22:06,914 --> 00:22:10,845
She's working very hard, isn't she?

282
00:22:19,354 --> 00:22:21,454
I'm sure you heard everything,

283
00:22:21,454 --> 00:22:25,764
but Mr. Yoon Hyeon Woo came to see me last night.

284
00:22:26,764 --> 00:22:30,014
It sounded like he went through a rough patch overseas.

285
00:22:30,014 --> 00:22:33,374
I think he nearly died.

286
00:22:33,374 --> 00:22:35,645
Seeing him,

287
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:40,245
I was vividly reminded of what happened twenty years ago.

288
00:22:40,245 --> 00:22:43,315
Do you remember, Mr. Vice-Chairman?

289
00:22:45,355 --> 00:22:47,654
The youngest grandson of Chairman Jin Yang Cheol.

290
00:22:47,654 --> 00:22:50,724
A third-generation member of the Soonyang Group family.

291
00:22:50,724 --> 00:22:55,595
He suddenly died a few days before his inauguration ceremony,

292
00:22:55,595 --> 00:23:02,594
but no one even talked about that incident

293
00:23:03,264 --> 00:23:08,335
because I took care of everything.

294
00:23:15,815 --> 00:23:22,414
Next time, you can give me these updates in my office, Director Kim.

295
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,145
Thank you.

296
00:24:14,145 --> 00:24:19,014
I got a lot of work done while you were asleep.

297
00:24:19,014 --> 00:24:21,815
Pick one. Which one do you want to hear first?

298
00:24:21,815 --> 00:24:25,054
Good news or bad news?

299
00:24:25,054 --> 00:24:26,985
Let's hear the bad news first.

300
00:24:26,985 --> 00:24:29,235
I suppose you're an optimist.

301
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:31,625
You seem confident that you can take care of it.

302
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:35,595
Okay, what do you need me to take care of?

303
00:24:35,595 --> 00:24:38,364
Assistant Manager Shin Gyeong Min has already fled the country.

304
00:24:38,364 --> 00:24:41,935
So as for who's behind him and where the 700 billion won  ($700M)  is,

305
00:24:41,935 --> 00:24:44,205
we can't track down either of them at the moment.

306
00:24:44,205 --> 00:24:46,904
In other words,

307
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:54,775
it will be difficult for me to be get the embezzlement charges dropped or get the APB lifted.

308
00:24:54,775 --> 00:24:57,114
You're quite impatient.

309
00:24:57,114 --> 00:25:00,454
You haven't heard the good news yet.

310
00:25:00,454 --> 00:25:03,385
Your embezzlement case.

311
00:25:03,385 --> 00:25:06,204
I'm the prosecutor in charge of the case now.

312
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:10,464
I went through the files on owner risk management.

313
00:25:10,464 --> 00:25:11,635
I'd guessed that would be the case,

314
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:16,264
but the prosecutor at the Eastern Office had received the Soonyang scholarship.

315
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:20,475
We're not concerned that you'd try to flee or destroy evidence.

316
00:25:20,475 --> 00:25:25,974
And you've been cooperative, so we'll investigate the case without keeping you in custody.

317
00:25:25,974 --> 00:25:27,784
The APB on you has been lifted.

318
00:25:27,784 --> 00:25:32,084
Unless there's other evidence that you indeed embezzled the money,

319
00:25:32,084 --> 00:25:35,985
the charges will be dropped due to lack of evidence.

320
00:25:37,695 --> 00:25:40,495
Oh, as for Soonyang Micro's slush fund of 700 billion,

321
00:25:40,495 --> 00:25:43,445
I'll continue to investigate to track down the money.

322
00:25:44,565 --> 00:25:46,734
You said I was Soonyang's Grim Reaper.

323
00:25:46,734 --> 00:25:48,934
I should live up to my reputation.

324
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,374
You can go home now.

325
00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:58,204
I'll contact you if I need to interview you as a witness.

326
00:25:58,204 --> 00:26:01,415
Go home and get some rest. Don't think about anything.

327
00:26:01,415 --> 00:26:05,015
It'll take some time for you to fully recover.

328
00:26:13,795 --> 00:26:17,795
A trainee gave me this as a gift on his last day here.

329
00:26:17,795 --> 00:26:22,904
I hear music enthusiasts listen to this vinyl record these days.

330
00:26:23,935 --> 00:26:25,935
I was a huge fan.

331
00:26:25,935 --> 00:26:29,574
Were you a fan too? Since the release of "I Know?"

332
00:26:33,145 --> 00:26:35,384
Someone I know was a fan.

333
00:26:39,184 --> 00:26:41,584
The woman I loved.

334
00:26:44,795 --> 00:26:46,824
She was a huge fan.

335
00:27:21,124 --> 00:27:26,864
 I expected no less because this is what I used to do at Soonyang. 

336
00:27:31,575 --> 00:27:34,804
   

337
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:41,744
 They want me to get scared and keep my lips sealed. 

338
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:23,370
   

339
00:28:28,594 --> 00:28:31,844
 I spent a week in the hospital as Yoon Hyeon Woo. 

340
00:28:54,925 --> 00:28:59,224
 I lived as Jin Do Jun for 17 years. 

341
00:29:10,664 --> 00:29:13,075
 Was it a dream? 

342
00:29:13,075 --> 00:29:14,675
 Or was I possessed? 

343
00:29:14,675 --> 00:29:18,645
 Or did I travel in time all by myself? 

344
00:29:18,645 --> 00:29:22,014
 I still haven't found the answer. 

345
00:29:24,385 --> 00:29:29,685
 Is it my sole responsibility to remember such vivid past life? 

346
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:30,856
 Here's... 

347
00:29:30,856 --> 00:29:33,195
   

348
00:29:33,195 --> 00:29:35,895
 someone I want to ask. 

349
00:29:45,175 --> 00:29:49,004
Sir, you have a guest.

350
00:29:49,004 --> 00:29:51,504
He's from Soonyang.

351
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:04,354
You're from Soonyang?

352
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:07,594
It's been ten years.

353
00:30:07,594 --> 00:30:12,664
Ten years since I sold all of my Soonyang shares and moved into this forest.

354
00:30:12,664 --> 00:30:14,034
Why did I do that?

355
00:30:14,034 --> 00:30:19,935
So I wouldn't see Soonyang buildings or use things made by Soonyang in my life.

356
00:30:19,935 --> 00:30:26,005
But you're polluting it, Soonyang Man.

357
00:30:27,274 --> 00:30:32,485
Must I put up with it?

358
00:30:34,784 --> 00:30:38,585
I wouldn't be able to, CEO Oh.

359
00:30:40,394 --> 00:30:43,464
I'm a former Soonyang Man

360
00:30:44,935 --> 00:30:49,535
who got shot in the head while running the owner's slush fund errand.

361
00:30:59,175 --> 00:31:02,344
These are Midtown Donuts.

362
00:31:02,344 --> 00:31:04,214
Get it out of my sight.

363
00:31:04,214 --> 00:31:06,054
Better yet, just throw them away.

364
00:31:06,054 --> 00:31:07,854
Okay.

365
00:31:08,584 --> 00:31:10,784
I never thought you'd hate it.

366
00:31:10,784 --> 00:31:13,795
Someone I know loves the donuts from here.

367
00:31:13,795 --> 00:31:17,795
Then why did you come to see me and not him?

368
00:31:18,535 --> 00:31:20,485
Because I wanted to know.

369
00:31:22,664 --> 00:31:26,404
The real reason you left Miracle.

370
00:31:27,604 --> 00:31:31,645
Do you think Korea Discount disappeared?

371
00:31:31,645 --> 00:31:35,675
No, not at all.

372
00:31:35,675 --> 00:31:39,115
This country is hopeless.

373
00:31:39,854 --> 00:31:42,654
Then why are you here?

374
00:31:42,654 --> 00:31:45,954
"It is time for Korea Discount to disappear from the market."

375
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:49,295
"Miracle Investment will move up that day."

376
00:31:49,295 --> 00:31:52,395
I remember those words were yours.

377
00:31:53,394 --> 00:31:55,804
But you were the one who had disappeared.

378
00:31:55,804 --> 00:32:00,135
An outstanding value investor leading a vulture fund, CEO Oh Se Hyeon.

379
00:32:00,135 --> 00:32:03,554
If you think you know who I am after reading

380
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:06,614
several books of mine, you are wrong.

381
00:32:08,545 --> 00:32:10,084
The one who had talked big about

382
00:32:10,084 --> 00:32:13,834
knowing all about Korea's market after writing several books was you.

383
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:19,894
That is why you've been hiding in this arboretum for years.

384
00:32:19,894 --> 00:32:21,955
What did you say?

385
00:32:21,955 --> 00:32:25,594
You're scared the world will find out

386
00:32:25,594 --> 00:32:28,045
that the value investment theory

387
00:32:28,045 --> 00:32:31,775
you claimed was actually you behaving as a New Yorker

388
00:32:31,775 --> 00:32:34,575
who didn't fit in the Korean market.

389
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,414
But most of all,

390
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:42,515
you're scared it'll be proven with money and income.

391
00:32:42,515 --> 00:32:45,384
That is why you're hiding.

392
00:32:47,654 --> 00:32:52,694
And while using your partner's death as the pretext.

393
00:32:56,864 --> 00:33:01,295
Nobody will know you have failed if you live while hiding

394
00:33:01,834 --> 00:33:05,740
among these trees for the rest of your life.

395
00:33:12,514 --> 00:33:15,345
Wait. Didn't you say earlier that you didn't even want to smell them?

396
00:33:15,345 --> 00:33:16,745
Whatever.

397
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:17,614
What was I supposed to do?

398
00:33:17,614 --> 00:33:21,984
The smell of it was enough to make me start drooling.

399
00:33:21,984 --> 00:33:25,054
You asked why I was hiding in this arboretum.

400
00:33:25,054 --> 00:33:27,964
It was to find a way not to watch

401
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:32,414
the disgusting and nasty siblings fight for the management rights.

402
00:33:33,934 --> 00:33:39,734
There won't be a fight if there aren't any management rights.

403
00:33:40,505 --> 00:33:43,905
I almost lost my life in the owner's succession fight.

404
00:33:44,974 --> 00:33:46,815
It's my turn now.

405
00:33:46,815 --> 00:33:50,985
The management rights they're holding on for dear life.

406
00:33:51,985 --> 00:33:54,735
I'll make sure they let go of it this time.

407
00:33:55,985 --> 00:33:57,885
How?

408
00:33:58,994 --> 00:34:01,355
I have you, CEO Oh.

409
00:34:02,264 --> 00:34:05,735
Please prove my idea into numbers.

410
00:34:06,764 --> 00:34:10,965
Accurate data for investment.

411
00:34:14,775 --> 00:34:16,605
You.

412
00:34:17,874 --> 00:34:19,545
Who are you?

413
00:34:20,874 --> 00:34:26,314
♪ Happy birthday, dear Mom ♪

414
00:34:27,514 --> 00:34:31,690
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

415
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:35,624
   

416
00:34:35,624 --> 00:34:37,164
Happy birthday, Mom.

417
00:34:37,164 --> 00:34:41,195
Let's only put two candles on the birthday cake.

418
00:34:41,195 --> 00:34:43,534
Because, Mom,

419
00:34:43,534 --> 00:34:48,474
your face looks like you're still in your late twenties.

420
00:34:49,744 --> 00:34:51,974
Forget about the candles.

421
00:34:51,974 --> 00:34:54,575
I'm a mom who's outliving her son.

422
00:34:54,575 --> 00:34:57,544
It's not a day to celebrate.

423
00:34:57,544 --> 00:35:00,354
I was in a hurry and couldn't buy a bouquet.

424
00:35:00,354 --> 00:35:02,385
Wait a second.

425
00:35:10,624 --> 00:35:14,805
It's your birthday. I couldn't possibly ignore it.

426
00:35:14,805 --> 00:35:16,834
After all this time?

427
00:35:16,834 --> 00:35:20,075
When I warned you that your family was dangerous

428
00:35:20,075 --> 00:35:25,944
and begged you to protect Do Jun, you ignored it.

429
00:35:26,675 --> 00:35:28,745
That was why Do Jun...

430
00:35:29,485 --> 00:35:33,814
You're right. It's all my fault.

431
00:35:33,814 --> 00:35:36,824
- But Honey... 
 - Look.

432
00:35:36,824 --> 00:35:38,695
You're still a coward.

433
00:35:38,695 --> 00:35:44,024
You know why and who caused Do Jun's accident, don't you?

434
00:35:45,465 --> 00:35:49,894
Using our young Do Jun and stepping foot inside Jeongsimjae

435
00:35:50,834 --> 00:35:54,334
was all because of your greed for Soonyang.

436
00:35:56,405 --> 00:36:03,045
You stole Do Jun away from me.

437
00:36:22,934 --> 00:36:26,275
Yes, I am Lee Hae In.

438
00:36:28,575 --> 00:36:31,045
Who are you again?

439
00:36:31,715 --> 00:36:37,414
From what I know, Do Jun left his Soonyang shares with you.

440
00:36:37,414 --> 00:36:39,814
Three percent of the corporation's shares.

441
00:36:46,095 --> 00:36:50,794
I heard you stepped down from your position.

442
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:52,995
I'm sure you came to secure my shares

443
00:36:52,995 --> 00:36:58,265
as a friendly share with the shareholders' meeting just around the corner.

444
00:36:58,265 --> 00:36:59,775
So whose side are you on?

445
00:36:59,775 --> 00:37:04,575
I'm on Do Jun's side.

446
00:37:05,314 --> 00:37:08,175
I'm one of his people, aren't I?

447
00:37:09,544 --> 00:37:15,315
I'm planning to find a new owner for Soonyang.

448
00:37:16,224 --> 00:37:19,624
Your shares and voting rights.

449
00:37:19,624 --> 00:37:21,254
It's time to use them properly.

450
00:37:21,254 --> 00:37:23,764
Is that even possible?

451
00:37:23,764 --> 00:37:27,764
Think about the shares Chairman Jin Young Ki and his son have.

452
00:37:29,034 --> 00:37:31,334
Mine aren't a match to theirs.

453
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:20,270
   

454
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,960
   

455
00:38:32,934 --> 00:38:35,735
- Come over here. 
 - Okay.

456
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,505
   

457
00:38:41,505 --> 00:38:44,704
Under the current law, everything is fine.

458
00:38:44,704 --> 00:38:50,274
You're right. This is what you are talking about, right?

459
00:38:51,784 --> 00:38:55,015
 Instead of having the board of directors dominated by the Soonyang owner's family, 

460
00:38:55,015 --> 00:38:58,854
 we will convene a shareholders' meeting through the minority shareholders' solidarity conference. 

461
00:38:58,854 --> 00:39:00,795
 Due to their nature, minority shareholders 

462
00:39:00,795 --> 00:39:04,065
 are not interested in equity structure or voting rights. 

463
00:39:04,065 --> 00:39:06,335
 We will select a provocative agenda to suit 

464
00:39:06,335 --> 00:39:08,735
 the interests of the minority shareholders 

465
00:39:08,735 --> 00:39:11,365
 who are extremely sensitive to stock revenue. 

466
00:39:11,365 --> 00:39:14,834
 "While Soonyang owner's family saved trillions of wons in inheritance tax," 

467
00:39:14,834 --> 00:39:18,005
 "how much did I lose from Soonyang's stocks?" 

468
00:39:18,005 --> 00:39:20,145
- We'd like a comment. 
 - Please say something.

469
00:39:20,145 --> 00:39:21,644
- A comment, please. 
 - How do you feel right now?

470
00:39:21,644 --> 00:39:24,445
- What is this for? 
 - What are you aiming?

471
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,985
We will make them take legal and economic responsibility

472
00:39:26,985 --> 00:39:29,414
for the property damage the minority shareholders suffered

473
00:39:29,414 --> 00:39:31,155
and give up their management rights.

474
00:39:31,155 --> 00:39:33,654
This is the first time minority shareholders' solidarity conference

475
00:39:33,654 --> 00:39:35,664
has convened a shareholders' meeting against a tycoon's conglomerate.

476
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:37,025
Do you think it's possible to strip the management rights

477
00:39:37,025 --> 00:39:40,334
and voting rights of the owner's family with the minority shareholders' power?

478
00:39:40,334 --> 00:39:42,494
It will be a miracle.

479
00:39:42,494 --> 00:39:47,705
I'd like to see such a miracle happen in Korea's market.

480
00:39:47,705 --> 00:39:51,005
That is why I, Oh Se Hyeon, have returned to Miracle.

481
00:39:51,005 --> 00:39:52,845
Please say a comment to the owner's family.

482
00:39:52,845 --> 00:39:55,814
- Over here, please. 
 - Why are you going this far?

483
00:39:55,814 --> 00:39:57,514
   

484
00:39:57,514 --> 00:40:02,255
The minority shareholders' solidarity conference is nothing to worry about, Vice Chairman.

485
00:40:02,255 --> 00:40:07,355
Rather than shareholders, they are more like speculators.

486
00:40:07,355 --> 00:40:13,034
Is there anything else as easy as settling it with money?

487
00:40:14,494 --> 00:40:18,834
Do you not know who's leading the minority shareholders' solidarity conference?

488
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:22,344
It's that Oh Se Hyeon of Miracle.

489
00:40:22,344 --> 00:40:24,374
Who knows what he'll use to pressure me this time?

490
00:40:24,374 --> 00:40:26,515
That, too,

491
00:40:30,715 --> 00:40:33,755
can be settled with money.

492
00:40:34,385 --> 00:40:38,994
So nobody dares shake you up, including Oh Se Hyeon,

493
00:40:38,994 --> 00:40:45,024
you simply have to purchase the shares needed to protect the management rights.

494
00:40:50,634 --> 00:40:52,235
The minority shareholders' solidarity conference

495
00:40:52,235 --> 00:40:54,874
withdrew their request for the general shareholders' meeting.

496
00:40:54,874 --> 00:41:00,105
Soonyang Corporation's board of directors provided money to the minority shareholders.

497
00:41:00,105 --> 00:41:04,784
As expected, they're sensitive about the profit in front of them.

498
00:41:04,784 --> 00:41:07,555
They get easily swayed.

499
00:41:07,555 --> 00:41:12,885
Do you still think the minority shareholders are our hope?

500
00:41:12,885 --> 00:41:17,795
This one was bait.

501
00:41:17,795 --> 00:41:21,734
The extraordinary shareholders' meeting was the bait we threw at them.

502
00:41:21,734 --> 00:41:25,465
Wait a bit longer. They'll start biting soon.

503
00:41:43,724 --> 00:41:47,224
Prosecutor Seo, a noticeable flow has recently been detected.

504
00:41:47,224 --> 00:41:50,325
An organization has purchased a large number of Soonyang Corporation shares.

505
00:41:50,325 --> 00:41:51,575
Here.

506
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:54,835
It's common for organizations to exchange shares before the shareholders' meeting.

507
00:41:54,835 --> 00:41:56,564
But the numbers are not small at all.

508
00:41:56,564 --> 00:41:58,305
Look, it's 600 billion won  ($600M) .

509
00:41:58,305 --> 00:42:01,434
I don't think this organization can mobilize this much in cash.

510
00:42:01,434 --> 00:42:03,775
A piece of noteworthy personal information is the head of the organization.

511
00:42:03,775 --> 00:42:05,644
It has been identified as a cousin

512
00:42:05,644 --> 00:42:09,394
of Art Director Mo Hyeon Min, Vice Chairman Jin Seong Jun's wife.

513
00:42:10,244 --> 00:42:14,394
A large investment has flowed into the organization recently.

514
00:42:15,255 --> 00:42:20,284
On March 28, a total of 700 billion won  ($700M) .

515
00:42:20,284 --> 00:42:25,355
 The person who needed the 700 billion won without the name Soonyang Micro. 

516
00:42:25,355 --> 00:42:27,034
 To siphon off the money, 

517
00:42:27,034 --> 00:42:31,084
 that person ordered Assistant Manager Shin Gyeong Min to kill me. 

518
00:42:31,084 --> 00:42:35,775
Wasn't March 28 when you went on an overseas business trip?

519
00:42:36,405 --> 00:42:40,875
Should we book Vice Chairman Jin as a suspect?

520
00:42:43,184 --> 00:42:46,454
No. The other party is the vice chairman of Soonyang.

521
00:42:46,454 --> 00:42:49,014
I have no power against him.

522
00:42:53,124 --> 00:42:56,274
It's been ages since I gave you the homework.

523
00:42:56,274 --> 00:42:58,495
But you only got in touch now.

524
00:42:58,495 --> 00:43:00,494
You're taking your sweet time.

525
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:01,564
Will you be able to prosecute

526
00:43:01,564 --> 00:43:03,564
Vice Chairman Jin Seong Jun before the shareholders' meeting?

527
00:43:03,564 --> 00:43:06,175
I didn't know we were meeting to check my homework.

528
00:43:06,175 --> 00:43:11,334
I thought you were going to cooperate with the prosecution investigation.

529
00:43:11,334 --> 00:43:13,775
There's no need to get offended.

530
00:43:13,775 --> 00:43:18,215
I'm only saying it for your sake.

531
00:43:19,084 --> 00:43:24,355
I haven't heard of a woman becoming the Prosecutor General yet in your field.

532
00:43:24,355 --> 00:43:27,794
It's an uneven playing field and a glass ceiling.

533
00:43:27,794 --> 00:43:31,195
There's no hope. So why keep working there?

534
00:43:37,705 --> 00:43:39,874
A woman can't become the Prosecutor General,

535
00:43:39,874 --> 00:43:42,924
but she can become the President of this country.

536
00:43:42,924 --> 00:43:47,374
If you want it, you don't have to worry about getting nominated.

537
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:48,544
Prosecutor Seo.

538
00:43:48,544 --> 00:43:52,244
It's come to an age where storytelling is necessary for politics.

539
00:43:52,244 --> 00:43:53,215
He's right.

540
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,684
You've got a great character, Prosecutor Seo.

541
00:43:55,684 --> 00:43:58,555
Soonyang's Grim Reaper, wasn't it?

542
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:05,525
But it would've been better if you had a stronger showpiece.

543
00:44:05,525 --> 00:44:09,104
Suspicion of Vice Chairman Jin Seong Jun's illegal succession.

544
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:12,834
Is getting him sentenced to jail enough to be a showpiece?

545
00:44:12,834 --> 00:44:14,004
Yes, somewhat.

546
00:44:14,004 --> 00:44:19,445
Please don't hesitate to ask for my support when you need it.

547
00:44:19,445 --> 00:44:25,045
You haven't changed at all from twenty years ago, Mr. Choi.

548
00:44:25,045 --> 00:44:29,814
It was around when Chairman Jin Young Ki succeeded Soonyang Group.

549
00:44:29,814 --> 00:44:32,595
The car accident that killed Director Jin Do Jun.

550
00:44:32,595 --> 00:44:35,425
You encouraged me to see the end of the investigation.

551
00:44:35,425 --> 00:44:36,994
But the very next day,

552
00:44:36,994 --> 00:44:38,364
you exercised

553
00:44:38,364 --> 00:44:43,065
the Minister of Justice's investigation command and stopped all investigations.

554
00:44:43,065 --> 00:44:46,475
- You see, back then... 
 - So?

555
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,875
What is it that you want?

556
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:52,555
Suspicion of Soonyang Corporation's illegal succession.

557
00:44:52,555 --> 00:44:55,725
Please hold a hearing in the National Assembly.

558
00:44:55,725 --> 00:44:57,744
Why a hearing out of the blue?

559
00:44:57,744 --> 00:45:00,784
Both Soonyang and the higher-ups of the prosecutors' office

560
00:45:00,784 --> 00:45:05,455
should know the whole nation is watching.

561
00:45:05,455 --> 00:45:08,595
The investigation must not get suspended due to external pressure.

562
00:45:08,595 --> 00:45:14,494
Only then will Vice Chairman Jin Seong Jun get arrested, as you wish.

563
00:45:17,204 --> 00:45:20,575
This is the first time Soonyang Group

564
00:45:20,575 --> 00:45:22,975
has been called for a hearing.

565
00:45:26,245 --> 00:45:30,874
It's a priceless experience Grandfather nor Father went through.

566
00:45:30,874 --> 00:45:32,885
It's such an honor, Mr. Kim.

567
00:45:32,885 --> 00:45:35,854
We had predicted such a thing to happen.

568
00:45:35,854 --> 00:45:42,485
I heard Mr. Choi Chang Je worked harder than ever to set up this hearing.

569
00:45:42,485 --> 00:45:43,865
With the shareholders' meeting ahead of us,

570
00:45:43,865 --> 00:45:47,864
Team Leader Yoon's accident was a favorable factor for your desperate family members

571
00:45:47,864 --> 00:45:50,865
to use to damage your reputation.

572
00:45:50,865 --> 00:45:51,975
So it's all my fault?

573
00:45:51,975 --> 00:45:56,145
It means we're almost there, Vice Chairman Jin.

574
00:45:56,145 --> 00:45:59,175
The management structure reformation is almost over.

575
00:45:59,175 --> 00:46:04,415
And we bought enough shares needed to protect the management rights.

576
00:46:04,415 --> 00:46:09,155
Nobody can stop you from becoming the next chairman.

577
00:46:10,824 --> 00:46:15,524
We can send Chairman Jin Young Ki to rest anytime we want.

578
00:46:15,524 --> 00:46:17,965
Don't you agree?

579
00:46:33,244 --> 00:46:34,945
In this hearing,

580
00:46:34,945 --> 00:46:39,314
various suspicions related to Soonyang's illegal succession will also be brought up.

581
00:46:39,314 --> 00:46:42,485
People will now become aware of what incredulous methods

582
00:46:42,485 --> 00:46:47,155
Soonyang has used to evade inheritance and gift taxes.

583
00:46:47,155 --> 00:46:51,964
But not many will think it's a crime worth punishing.

584
00:46:51,964 --> 00:46:55,395
People believe inheritance is human instinct.

585
00:46:55,395 --> 00:47:00,034
Rather, they'll feel bummed for not being that lucky person.

586
00:47:00,034 --> 00:47:01,935
Prosecutor Seo.

587
00:47:02,974 --> 00:47:05,615
The guest you're scheduled to meet at 5 p.m. is in the reception room.

588
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:06,845
I can't miss this meeting.

589
00:47:06,845 --> 00:47:09,614
Please ask him if you have any further questions.

590
00:47:09,614 --> 00:47:11,245
Okay.

591
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,214
Prosecutor Seo.

592
00:47:16,255 --> 00:47:19,954
We won't see each other until the hearing, will we?

593
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:25,795
Oh, right. Mr. Yoon.

594
00:47:27,994 --> 00:47:31,534
You've really done a great job until now.

595
00:47:34,505 --> 00:47:39,305
Thanks to you, we've come this far against Soonyang.

596
00:47:40,845 --> 00:47:43,684
Let's keep up the good work.

597
00:47:50,385 --> 00:47:51,885
Of course.

598
00:47:51,885 --> 00:47:54,085
Then I'll see you on that day.

599
00:48:14,645 --> 00:48:16,345
Oh, you see.

600
00:48:17,045 --> 00:48:19,554
It suits her well.

601
00:48:19,554 --> 00:48:22,960
Prosecutor Seo's nickname.

602
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,755
Do you mean Soonyang's Grim Reaper?

603
00:48:24,755 --> 00:48:25,925
Yes.

604
00:48:25,925 --> 00:48:29,055
People have no idea what's going through in her mind.

605
00:48:29,055 --> 00:48:30,664
Prosecutor Seo.

606
00:48:30,664 --> 00:48:32,494
She had a fiance.

607
00:48:32,494 --> 00:48:34,834
Don't be shocked at who he was.

608
00:48:34,834 --> 00:48:37,265
He was the grandson of Soonyang Group.

609
00:48:37,265 --> 00:48:41,434
Amid the siblings' succession war, he met a dubious accidental death.

610
00:48:41,434 --> 00:48:44,845
I heard it was about twenty years ago.

611
00:48:44,845 --> 00:48:48,195
The investigation ended due to Soonyang's pressure.

612
00:48:48,195 --> 00:48:52,844
That is why she goes all out to make things right regarding Soonyang.

613
00:48:52,844 --> 00:48:57,214
She doesn't wear black every day to look like the grim reaper.

614
00:48:57,214 --> 00:49:00,195
It's her way of mourning.

615
00:49:00,195 --> 00:49:01,855
I see.

616
00:49:09,264 --> 00:49:13,474
You're having him stand as a witness at the hearing, right?

617
00:49:13,474 --> 00:49:18,374
He's the sole survivor and witness of the scene.

618
00:49:26,014 --> 00:49:28,155
Did you find it?

619
00:49:35,965 --> 00:49:39,465
Did I have to find out about the hearing through the news?

620
00:49:39,465 --> 00:49:41,094
Answer me.

621
00:49:41,094 --> 00:49:42,764
How can you call us a family?

622
00:49:42,764 --> 00:49:45,865
We don't have time for a family fight.

623
00:49:45,865 --> 00:49:50,005
The talk about the hearing alone is making the share price plummet.

624
00:49:50,005 --> 00:49:54,474
We must devise a plan to protect the share price first.

625
00:49:54,474 --> 00:49:58,484
Whether it's a hearing investigation or a prosecution investigation,

626
00:49:58,484 --> 00:50:04,014
horrible incidents like attempted murder have nothing to do with Soonyang.

627
00:50:04,014 --> 00:50:07,725
It was an individual's deviance, no?

628
00:50:07,725 --> 00:50:13,164
Let's make a public apology and make Seong Jun resign from the vice-chairman position.

629
00:50:16,405 --> 00:50:20,704
Now I finally understand why you all came here in a hurry this late at night.

630
00:50:20,704 --> 00:50:22,704
Seize the chance, right?

631
00:50:22,704 --> 00:50:25,845
Seong Jun has fallen into a trap.

632
00:50:25,845 --> 00:50:30,514
But you're putting pressure on him to take away the management rights.

633
00:50:30,514 --> 00:50:31,485
So what family?

634
00:50:31,485 --> 00:50:33,715
It's not as if we don't have our reason.

635
00:50:33,715 --> 00:50:36,084
He has a history.

636
00:50:36,084 --> 00:50:38,385
Everyone here knows, right?

637
00:50:38,385 --> 00:50:40,794
Why Do Jun died twenty years ago.

638
00:50:40,794 --> 00:50:42,425
- Back then, Seong Jun... 
 - Hey.

639
00:50:42,425 --> 00:50:44,465
Sister-in-law!

640
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:53,134
Our nephew Do Jun passed away in a three-car rear-end collision.

641
00:50:53,134 --> 00:50:55,534
You all know it well.

642
00:50:55,534 --> 00:50:57,044
Let's be careful, okay?

643
00:50:57,044 --> 00:51:00,515
If words start to get out, everything will get out of hand.

644
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:06,944
It will be the end of us and Soonyang Group, 
not only Seong Jun here!

645
00:51:20,265 --> 00:51:22,795
It's the same as twenty years ago.

646
00:51:22,795 --> 00:51:26,374
Just like today, you were all convinced I had killed Do Jun.

647
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:29,904
There was no evidence, but no doubt either.

648
00:51:29,904 --> 00:51:31,944
But why?

649
00:51:31,944 --> 00:51:33,475
Tell me.

650
00:51:33,475 --> 00:51:35,775
Why?

651
00:51:35,775 --> 00:51:38,414
Didn't everyone here want to kill Do Jun?

652
00:51:38,414 --> 00:51:41,355
- Am I wrong? 
 - Enough, Seong Jun!

653
00:51:47,394 --> 00:51:50,295
I'm sorry, Mother. Excuse me first.

654
00:51:54,834 --> 00:51:57,604
Watch your mouth, will you?

655
00:51:57,604 --> 00:52:03,275
Aren't we a family? So how could you suspect him?

656
00:52:22,124 --> 00:52:27,124
 Don't you have something to tell me? 

657
00:52:31,365 --> 00:52:35,034
 It wasn't me, Father. I swear. 

658
00:52:38,245 --> 00:52:41,475
 D-Don't you believe me? 

659
00:52:41,475 --> 00:52:42,615
 I-It wasn't me. 

660
00:52:42,615 --> 00:52:46,115
 Do Jun's accident had nothing to do with me, Father! 

661
00:52:46,115 --> 00:52:47,855
 Is that so? 

662
00:53:07,605 --> 00:53:09,845
   

663
00:53:09,845 --> 00:53:15,505
 It was found at the scene of Do Jun's accident. 

664
00:53:16,784 --> 00:53:18,345
 How will you explain 

665
00:53:18,345 --> 00:53:20,755
 this business card was found in the driver's seat 

666
00:53:20,755 --> 00:53:22,655
 of the car at fault? 

667
00:53:22,655 --> 00:53:28,425
 Even your name was on the driver's bank account details. 

668
00:53:32,534 --> 00:53:34,165
 Father. 

669
00:53:40,135 --> 00:53:41,275
 I know. 

670
00:53:41,275 --> 00:53:46,575
 I know how much you detest Do Jun. 

671
00:53:47,274 --> 00:53:51,784
 Everyone in this family knows how you feel. 

672
00:53:53,255 --> 00:53:55,755
 Yes, it must be frustrating. 

673
00:53:55,755 --> 00:54:00,855
 Nobody would believe you in this situation. 

674
00:54:10,604 --> 00:54:12,335
 That's right. 

675
00:54:13,075 --> 00:54:16,945
 Seong Jun. Don't worry. 

676
00:54:17,905 --> 00:54:20,745
 You have me, your father. 

677
00:54:21,814 --> 00:54:25,145
 I will not let you live as a murderer. 

678
00:54:31,255 --> 00:54:37,854
 For now, I'd better have the management rights. 

679
00:54:37,854 --> 00:54:41,534
 Only then will the people not suspect you. 

680
00:54:43,305 --> 00:54:48,865
 From now on, only listen to me. 

681
00:54:49,874 --> 00:54:51,574
 Seong Jun. 

682
00:55:13,965 --> 00:55:18,734
Inform them that you can't get to the hearing if it's stressing you out too much.

683
00:55:19,675 --> 00:55:23,775
It's not a legal obligation anyway.

684
00:55:23,775 --> 00:55:26,175
Aren't you curious?

685
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:32,415
Aren't you curious about whether I incited the murder of our employee or not?

686
00:55:32,415 --> 00:55:34,155
It doesn't matter.

687
00:55:34,155 --> 00:55:37,184
What matters to me... No.

688
00:55:37,184 --> 00:55:39,354
What matters to us is

689
00:55:39,354 --> 00:55:42,725
not to make any reasons for having you disqualified

690
00:55:42,725 --> 00:55:46,764
from being appointed as Soonyang Group's chairman.

691
00:55:47,334 --> 00:55:49,684
You won't be attending the hearing.

692
00:55:49,684 --> 00:55:51,965
It's been decided.

693
00:56:00,445 --> 00:56:02,374
Mr. Kim.

694
00:56:03,684 --> 00:56:05,785
I've made up my mind.

695
00:56:07,414 --> 00:56:10,184
Let's attend the hearing.

696
00:56:19,065 --> 00:56:20,395
- Here they are. 
 - They're here.

697
00:56:20,395 --> 00:56:25,394
   

698
00:56:25,394 --> 00:56:27,334
- Please make way. 
 - Over here.

699
00:56:27,334 --> 00:56:29,405
Make way.

700
00:56:30,405 --> 00:56:31,544
Do you admit to inciting the murder?

701
00:56:31,544 --> 00:56:33,575
- I'm from Jaeil News. 
 - Look over here.

702
00:56:33,575 --> 00:56:35,314
- Please say something. 
 - Vice Chairman Jin!

703
00:56:35,314 --> 00:56:36,584
Look this way.

704
00:56:36,584 --> 00:56:39,644
 An investigation hearing on the alleged illegal succession of Soonyang Group 

705
00:56:39,644 --> 00:56:42,915
 is currently underway at the National Assembly's main meeting hall. 

706
00:56:42,915 --> 00:56:44,454
 An intensive question-and-answer session 

707
00:56:44,454 --> 00:56:46,195
 is expected at today's hearing 

708
00:56:46,195 --> 00:56:47,425
 on various suspicions 

709
00:56:47,425 --> 00:56:50,195
 surrounding Soonyang's expedient succession 

710
00:56:50,195 --> 00:56:51,625
 and the attempted murder discovered 

711
00:56:51,625 --> 00:56:54,365
 during the recent illegal overseas slush funds investigation. 

712
00:56:54,365 --> 00:56:56,704
 The next chairman appointment of Soonyang Group, 

713
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:58,034
 scheduled to take place 

714
00:56:58,034 --> 00:57:00,305
 at Soonyang Corporation's shareholders' meeting next month, 

715
00:57:00,305 --> 00:57:02,004
 is expected to change significantly 

716
00:57:02,004 --> 00:57:04,804
 depending on the results of today's hearing. 

717
00:57:06,744 --> 00:57:08,045
It's Vice Chairman Jin!

718
00:57:08,045 --> 00:57:09,944
It's Vice Chairman Jin.

719
00:57:09,944 --> 00:57:11,584
- Over here. 
 - Give us a statement.

720
00:57:11,584 --> 00:57:13,055
Do you admit to the suspicions?

721
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:14,755
How do you feel right now?

722
00:57:14,755 --> 00:57:16,655
Vice Chairman Jin, any comments to make?

723
00:57:16,655 --> 00:57:18,425
- Please say something. 
 - Vice Chairman Jin!

724
00:57:18,425 --> 00:57:20,595
- How do you feel? 
 - What do you plan to say?

725
00:57:20,595 --> 00:57:22,394
- We'd like a comment. 
 - Are you ready for the hearing?

726
00:57:22,394 --> 00:57:24,095
Are the suspicions true?

727
00:57:24,095 --> 00:57:25,325
Vice Chairman Jin!

728
00:57:25,325 --> 00:57:27,235
Are you involved in the attempted murder?

729
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:30,564
Do you have anything to say about the suspicions?

730
00:57:34,305 --> 00:57:37,974
I didn't know you had such a talent, Team Leader Yoon.

731
00:57:37,974 --> 00:57:42,445
Who would've thought you'd conduct a hearing against Soonyang?

732
00:57:42,445 --> 00:57:45,245
How do you feel?

733
00:57:45,245 --> 00:57:48,085
Your advice really helped, Mr. Kim.

734
00:57:48,085 --> 00:57:54,555
"Revenge is for those with power, not for those who have been wronged."

735
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:58,395
By any chance, do you know why?

736
00:58:01,035 --> 00:58:03,205
Soonyang Micro's ledger.

737
00:58:03,205 --> 00:58:08,004
The reason why you went to Vice Chairman Jin and reported it.

738
00:58:08,004 --> 00:58:10,980
I was wondering if you knew the reason.

739
00:58:12,644 --> 00:58:15,194
Because of your conscience?

740
00:58:16,414 --> 00:58:17,714
No.

741
00:58:17,714 --> 00:58:25,385
You went over to wag your tail at Vice Chairman Jin Seong Jun who'd be your new owner.

742
00:58:25,385 --> 00:58:29,895
You needed a new connection to replace the collapsed chairman.

743
00:58:29,895 --> 00:58:33,494
And you probably wanted to show something to other staff

744
00:58:33,494 --> 00:58:37,065
who sneered at you because you're only a high school graduate.

745
00:58:42,974 --> 00:58:50,504
I needed you to know who you really were before you went inside.

746
00:58:50,504 --> 00:58:55,555
That way, you can be yourself as you give them answers.

747
00:59:11,964 --> 00:59:15,134
   

748
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:17,375
   

749
00:59:19,545 --> 00:59:21,615
What were you in charge of

750
00:59:21,615 --> 00:59:25,415
when you were on a business trip abroad, Mr. Yoon Hyeon Woo?

751
00:59:25,415 --> 00:59:30,784
I was in charge of reverting 700 billion won  ($700M)  back to Soonyang.

752
00:59:30,784 --> 00:59:35,155
Witness, did you succeed?

753
00:59:35,925 --> 00:59:38,465
No, I couldn't.

754
00:59:38,465 --> 00:59:40,734
Why not?

755
00:59:40,734 --> 00:59:44,205
I was abducted by assailants, got shot,

756
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:46,934
and lost consciousness.

757
00:59:51,405 --> 00:59:54,275
The one who hired local assailants to shoot you

758
00:59:54,275 --> 00:59:59,315
and took 700 billion won of slush fund was someone you were acquainted with?

759
00:59:59,315 --> 01:00:01,955
- Is that correct? 
 - Yes, it is.

760
01:00:01,955 --> 01:00:05,325
A staff member of Soonyang Group's Future Asset Management Department.

761
01:00:05,325 --> 01:00:07,854
He said it was an order from his superior.

762
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:10,594
Who do you think it was?

763
01:00:18,005 --> 01:00:21,474
I think it was Vice Chairman Jin Seong Jun.

764
01:00:21,474 --> 01:00:25,105
- Jin Seong Jun? 
 - Does he really thinks so?

765
01:00:25,105 --> 01:00:26,945
- Really? 
 - He said Jin Seong Jun.

766
01:00:26,945 --> 01:00:29,414
You. How can you be so sure?

767
01:00:29,414 --> 01:00:32,514
Do you have any grounds for your argument?

768
01:00:34,455 --> 01:00:35,454
   

769
01:00:35,454 --> 01:00:36,585
Witness.

770
01:00:36,585 --> 01:00:42,095
Recently, an organization bought out 600 billion won  ($600M)  worth of Soonyang Corporation's shares.

771
01:00:42,095 --> 01:00:44,395
Were you aware of this?

772
01:00:44,395 --> 01:00:47,264
Yes, I found out through a public announcement.

773
01:00:47,264 --> 01:00:49,394
So you had no idea before the announcement?

774
01:00:49,394 --> 01:00:53,605
When the head of the organization is your wife's relative?

775
01:00:53,605 --> 01:00:59,574
I've been too busy with work, so I did not get to look after my in-laws.

776
01:00:59,574 --> 01:01:03,744
Do you mean this has nothing to do with defending your managerial rights?

777
01:01:03,744 --> 01:01:06,314
Who would believe that?

778
01:01:06,314 --> 01:01:11,284
Soonyang Corporation's shares are considered solid and wanted by anybody.

779
01:01:11,284 --> 01:01:14,895
I believe this was simply a wise investment on their part.

780
01:01:16,025 --> 01:01:19,164
The public sentiment began to change as soon as the hearing began.

781
01:01:19,164 --> 01:01:21,764
Vice Chairman Jin Seong Jun is a hot issue on social media.

782
01:01:21,764 --> 01:01:23,205
His fashion in the hearing.

783
01:01:23,205 --> 01:01:25,604
His composed manners as a grandson of a rich family.

784
01:01:25,604 --> 01:01:31,404
The public sentiment did change in the opposite direction of our expectations.

785
01:01:33,414 --> 01:01:35,314
Who is the next witness?

786
01:01:35,314 --> 01:01:38,215
These witnesses will testify that Soonyang was

787
01:01:38,215 --> 01:01:41,715
behind the attempted murder of Mr. Yoon Hyeon Woo.

788
01:01:41,715 --> 01:01:44,355
Agents of the National Intelligence Service

789
01:01:44,355 --> 01:01:47,925
who witnessed the accident and saved Mr. Yoon.

790
01:01:57,465 --> 01:02:02,234
The witnesses just contacted us that they could not make it

791
01:02:02,234 --> 01:02:07,575
due to unforeseen personal circumstances.

792
01:02:09,575 --> 01:02:13,385
These people moved the date around to return to Korea for the hearing.

793
01:02:13,385 --> 01:02:17,784
These personal reasons must be Soonyang.

794
01:02:30,735 --> 01:02:34,374
Without the testimony of the NIS agents,

795
01:02:34,374 --> 01:02:37,575
we have no other way of proving Soonyang's murder instigation.

796
01:02:37,575 --> 01:02:39,305
It happened once before twenty years ago.

797
01:02:39,305 --> 01:02:41,644
A murder surrounding the succession.

798
01:02:41,644 --> 01:02:45,314
It was covered up as a car accident, but it was obviously a murder case.

799
01:02:45,314 --> 01:02:49,654
If the hearing ends like this, it's too unfair for you, Mr. Yoon.

800
01:02:49,654 --> 01:02:55,055
We found the sole witness and survivor of the accident.

801
01:02:55,055 --> 01:02:58,864
He'll come and bear witness to the situation of that day.

802
01:02:58,864 --> 01:03:02,764
Then let us begin the questioning for the next witness.

803
01:03:02,764 --> 01:03:05,764
Witness, please be seated.

804
01:03:48,774 --> 01:03:53,114
   

805
01:03:53,114 --> 01:03:57,855
   

806
01:03:57,855 --> 01:04:00,835
What do you think you're doing?

807
01:04:00,835 --> 01:04:04,155
My poor son died an unfair death.

808
01:04:04,155 --> 01:04:09,964
I had to lift his grudge before I passed away.

809
01:04:14,374 --> 01:04:17,945
Witness, please tell us who you are.

810
01:04:19,945 --> 01:04:23,145
Well, right.

811
01:04:23,945 --> 01:04:25,845
Ha In Seok.

812
01:04:25,845 --> 01:04:30,185
My name is Ha In Seok.

813
01:04:30,185 --> 01:04:33,074
The grandson of Soonyang Group

814
01:04:33,074 --> 01:04:37,554
Director Jin Do Jun's secretary.

815
01:04:37,554 --> 01:04:41,145
Wait, so nobody knows who Director Jin Do Jun is?

816
01:04:43,204 --> 01:04:45,505
Twenty years ago,

817
01:04:49,505 --> 01:04:51,244
he was murdered.

818
01:04:51,244 --> 01:04:53,445
- What? 
 - What's he saying?

819
01:04:53,445 --> 01:04:55,874
- He was killed? 
 - Jin Do Jun?

820
01:04:55,874 --> 01:04:58,784
Witness, only answer the questions we ask.

821
01:04:58,784 --> 01:05:01,014
Why?

822
01:05:01,014 --> 01:05:03,934
Are you going to shut me up again?

823
01:05:03,934 --> 01:05:06,905
I've stayed quiet enough for the last twenty years.

824
01:05:07,954 --> 01:05:10,124
I still...

825
01:05:10,124 --> 01:05:13,124
I still remember it like it was yesterday.

826
01:05:13,124 --> 01:05:15,364
That car accident.

827
01:05:15,364 --> 01:05:17,934
It wasn't an accident.

828
01:05:18,764 --> 01:05:20,634
It was a murder case.

829
01:05:20,634 --> 01:05:23,104
- Murder? 
 - Is he serious?

830
01:05:23,104 --> 01:05:25,374
- What? 
 - What's he saying?

831
01:05:25,374 --> 01:05:27,675
- Can he prove that? 
 - He was murdered?

832
01:05:27,675 --> 01:05:29,345
- That car accident? 
 - Director Jin Do Jun?

833
01:05:29,345 --> 01:05:30,885
Witness.

834
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:37,355
Did you just say it was a murder case, not a car accident?

835
01:05:38,284 --> 01:05:42,425
Do you know who did it?

836
01:05:52,835 --> 01:05:58,534
The accomplice is sitting here right now.

837
01:06:19,625 --> 01:06:21,864
You remember me, right?

838
01:06:23,735 --> 01:06:29,574
You know, you were there with me at the scene of the car accident.

839
01:06:44,155 --> 01:06:46,324
Director Jin Do Jun.

840
01:06:46,954 --> 01:06:48,454
Director Jin.

841
01:06:48,454 --> 01:06:50,965
You can't stay here. You must leave.

842
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:52,025
Let go of me!

843
01:06:52,025 --> 01:06:55,394
You cannot let them take you down just as they did on that day.

844
01:06:55,394 --> 01:06:56,395
Let go of me!

845
01:06:56,395 --> 01:06:58,465
Director Jin, you can't stay here!

846
01:06:58,465 --> 01:07:00,405
You cannot stay here, Director Jin!

847
01:07:00,405 --> 01:07:03,374
Director Jin! You must leave!

848
01:07:20,494 --> 01:07:22,054
Thank you.

849
01:07:22,054 --> 01:07:26,695
Mr. Ha In Seok is suffering from alcoholic dementia.

850
01:07:26,695 --> 01:07:29,795
Everything he said on the witness stand

851
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:33,534
will not be taken into account as a valid testimony.

852
01:07:33,534 --> 01:07:36,745
I should have checked his condition a bit more thoroughly.

853
01:07:36,745 --> 01:07:40,974
I thought this hearing might be our last chance,

854
01:07:41,845 --> 01:07:44,544
so I got ahead of myself.

855
01:07:47,385 --> 01:07:52,684
Are you afraid the culprits won't be punished? Is that why?

856
01:07:52,684 --> 01:07:54,855
Because I felt bad.

857
01:07:56,495 --> 01:08:01,394
If I had resolved this case twenty years ago,

858
01:08:01,394 --> 01:08:07,035
I wouldn't have met you now as another victim of Soonyang.

859
01:08:10,305 --> 01:08:12,955
That's why I worked harder on this.

860
01:08:14,244 --> 01:08:16,144
Because I felt bad.

861
01:08:41,374 --> 01:08:44,704
Yes, I just arrived.

862
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:48,124
Is this the right place? I don't see anyone here.

863
01:08:56,214 --> 01:08:58,154
Yes, I...

864
01:10:15,265 --> 01:10:17,064
 Assistant Manager Yoon. 

865
01:10:17,905 --> 01:10:20,264
 Assistant Manager Yoon Hyeon Woo. 

866
01:10:20,264 --> 01:10:22,705
 Hey, Yoon Hyeon Woo, answer me! 

867
01:10:25,944 --> 01:10:29,674
Someone... Someone just died here.

868
01:10:29,674 --> 01:10:33,315
Someone... Someone just died.

869
01:10:34,654 --> 01:10:39,584
Someone died because of me!

870
01:10:47,535 --> 01:10:55,094
Why didn't you tell me that this kind of job is what I'm supposed to do?

871
01:10:56,435 --> 01:10:59,735
That I was to work as bait for someone's murder?

872
01:10:59,735 --> 01:11:02,395
You should've told me from the start.

873
01:11:04,784 --> 01:11:07,314
What would change?

874
01:11:10,624 --> 01:11:16,924
If I had known, I would not have followed your orders.

875
01:11:18,365 --> 01:11:23,334
Then your contract with Soonyang will expire as of this month.

876
01:11:24,164 --> 01:11:26,635
You'll have to go back to your ragged home

877
01:11:26,635 --> 01:11:28,434
with your sick brother and dad who is a credit defaulter,

878
01:11:28,434 --> 01:11:31,575
living as a contract worker for subcontractors for life,

879
01:11:31,575 --> 01:11:35,914
then bequeath your disgusting poverty,

880
01:11:35,914 --> 01:11:39,984
proud of the fact that you were a good man.

881
01:11:46,654 --> 01:11:49,724
You only live once.

882
01:11:54,234 --> 01:11:57,084
You should get to live well like the others do.

883
01:12:17,184 --> 01:12:19,025
Is this the police?

884
01:12:19,025 --> 01:12:21,354
I have something to report.

885
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:48,270
   

886
01:12:55,924 --> 01:12:57,995
 Sir? 

887
01:12:59,295 --> 01:13:02,664
 Please speak. Hello? 

888
01:13:02,664 --> 01:13:04,565
 Hello? 

889
01:13:35,535 --> 01:13:38,234
When the owner's family gives an order, do not turn it down.

890
01:13:38,234 --> 01:13:40,034
Do not ask questions.

891
01:13:40,034 --> 01:13:42,574
Do not make a judgment.

892
01:13:42,574 --> 01:13:44,644
When the owner's family gives an order, do not turn it down.

893
01:13:44,644 --> 01:13:46,745
Do not ask questions. Do not make a judgment.

894
01:13:46,745 --> 01:13:48,814
When the owner's family gives an order, do not turn it down.

895
01:13:48,814 --> 01:13:51,564
Do not ask questions. Do not make a judgment.

896
01:13:53,085 --> 01:13:59,755
 That day, what I wanted to wipe away 

897
01:14:02,755 --> 01:14:05,764
 wasn't the scar left on my hand. 

898
01:14:10,034 --> 01:14:11,765
 It was the face. 

899
01:14:14,634 --> 01:14:21,584
 It was Jin Do Jun's face that looked at me. 

900
01:14:23,045 --> 01:14:25,845
I don't know the passcode to your house.

901
01:14:27,285 --> 01:14:28,386
   

902
01:14:28,386 --> 01:14:29,555
   

903
01:14:29,555 --> 01:14:33,385
   

904
01:14:35,395 --> 01:14:38,165
I sent you a temporary number. You can check.

905
01:14:38,165 --> 01:14:39,664
   

906
01:14:39,664 --> 01:14:41,564
One and nine.

907
01:14:43,364 --> 01:14:46,234
Zero, nine, one, nine.

908
01:14:46,234 --> 01:14:48,305
It's open.

909
01:14:50,605 --> 01:14:53,145
So what do I have to do now?

910
01:15:15,765 --> 01:15:20,205
So you're asking me to send you whatever's in here to your phone?

911
01:15:20,205 --> 01:15:23,945
Before we resume the hearing, I have an announcement to make.

912
01:15:23,945 --> 01:15:26,045
The witness from this morning, Ha In Seok,

913
01:15:26,045 --> 01:15:29,545
was confirmed with a history of alcohol dementia.

914
01:15:29,545 --> 01:15:35,444
Everything he said in the hearing is difficult to be discerned as facts.

915
01:15:35,444 --> 01:15:38,125
Therefore, his testimony will not be accepted.

916
01:15:38,125 --> 01:15:40,955
Soonyang Corporation and Jin Do Jun...

917
01:15:40,955 --> 01:15:43,555
 Someone... Someone just died here. 

918
01:15:43,555 --> 01:15:45,764
 Someone... Someone just... 

919
01:15:45,764 --> 01:15:48,665
 Someone died. Can you call an ambulance? 

920
01:15:48,665 --> 01:15:52,665
 Someone just died. Please. 

921
01:15:52,665 --> 01:15:56,975
 Someone died because of me! 

922
01:15:56,975 --> 01:15:58,745
 Someone just died! 

923
01:15:58,745 --> 01:16:00,275
   

924
01:16:00,275 --> 01:16:02,074
What is this?

925
01:16:07,885 --> 01:16:12,785
Did you say it's difficult to trust Ha In Seok's witness account

926
01:16:13,724 --> 01:16:18,195
of the accident twenty years ago because of his alcoholic dementia?

927
01:16:20,225 --> 01:16:25,034
In that case, what about the accomplice's confession?

928
01:16:25,034 --> 01:16:27,465
- What? 
 - What?

929
01:16:27,465 --> 01:16:28,576
What now?

930
01:16:28,576 --> 01:16:36,044
I am the accomplice who was on the scene of Director Jin Do Jun's death.

931
01:16:36,044 --> 01:16:40,084
- What's he saying? 
 - Is he serious?

932
01:16:40,084 --> 01:16:45,864
The phone conversation recorded on my phone from the accident is proof.

933
01:16:45,864 --> 01:16:47,155
What is he saying?

934
01:16:47,155 --> 01:16:49,394
 Assistant Manager Yoon. Assistant Manager Yoon Hyeon Woo. 

935
01:16:49,394 --> 01:16:51,724
 Pull yourself together and answer me. 

936
01:16:51,724 --> 01:16:54,424
 Is anybody around you? 

937
01:16:54,424 --> 01:16:57,565
 Leave the area before anyone sees you. 

938
01:16:58,334 --> 01:17:01,484
 Do not get worked up. Keep your calm as you move. 

939
01:17:07,574 --> 01:17:09,515
 Good work. 

940
01:17:11,415 --> 01:17:17,784
 I hope Seong Jun understands his father's profound wisdom. 

941
01:17:17,784 --> 01:17:19,285
 - Director Kim. 
 - Yes, Sir. 

942
01:17:19,285 --> 01:17:24,354
 I am Jin Yang Cheol's son. 

943
01:17:24,354 --> 01:17:26,365
 His eldest son. 

944
01:17:33,164 --> 01:17:35,705
   

945
01:17:35,705 --> 01:17:38,845
Mr. Jin Seong Jun! Is this true?

946
01:17:38,845 --> 01:17:43,474
Were you aware of your father, Chairman Jin Young Ki's crime?

947
01:17:43,474 --> 01:17:47,414
Were you two in this together to take the management rights?

948
01:17:47,414 --> 01:17:48,984
Witness, answer me.

949
01:17:48,984 --> 01:17:50,625
- Witness! 
 - Witness!

950
01:17:50,625 --> 01:17:54,084
- Answer me, Mr. Jin Seong Jun! 
 - Witness!

951
01:17:54,084 --> 01:17:57,464
- Why won't he say anything? 
 - Did you do it?

952
01:17:57,464 --> 01:17:58,665
Go ahead and answer.

953
01:17:58,665 --> 01:18:01,534
Did he really do that?

954
01:18:07,534 --> 01:18:10,905
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

955
01:18:10,905 --> 01:18:13,174
Is this your revenge?

956
01:18:15,574 --> 01:18:21,185
You finally managed to live like a decent human thanks to the money Soonyang gave you.

957
01:18:21,185 --> 01:18:22,614
How dare you do this?

958
01:18:22,614 --> 01:18:24,315
Put the cameras away.

959
01:18:24,315 --> 01:18:25,385
Put the cameras away!

960
01:18:25,385 --> 01:18:27,484
- Goodness. 
 - Get him.

961
01:18:27,484 --> 01:18:30,994
This is why you never treat your underlings well.

962
01:18:30,994 --> 01:18:34,865
The rich man's dog thinks he became a rich man.

963
01:18:37,665 --> 01:18:41,164
I raised a dog that grew up to bite its owner.

964
01:18:42,674 --> 01:18:44,905
- You cannot do this! 
 - Move!

965
01:18:44,905 --> 01:18:47,545
Let go. Let go of me!

966
01:18:47,545 --> 01:18:49,045
Let go!

967
01:18:49,045 --> 01:18:53,015
The world can't take me down!

968
01:18:53,015 --> 01:18:55,584
 During the hearing of Soonyang's illegal succession, 

969
01:18:55,584 --> 01:18:59,155
 crucial evidence was presented to prove 

970
01:18:59,155 --> 01:19:02,494
 Chairman Jin Young Ki's murder instigation 

971
01:19:02,494 --> 01:19:05,264
 of Jin Do Jun's murder in 2004. 

972
01:19:27,215 --> 01:19:29,185
Boycott Soonyang's products!

973
01:19:29,185 --> 01:19:31,255
- Boycott! 
 - Boycott!

974
01:19:31,255 --> 01:19:33,125
Do not buy or sell

975
01:19:33,125 --> 01:19:34,654
- Soonyang's products! 
 - Do not buy or sell!

976
01:19:34,654 --> 01:19:38,465
 The anger against the owners of Soonyang led to a boycott, 

977
01:19:38,465 --> 01:19:40,465
 and the group finally caved in. 

978
01:19:40,465 --> 01:19:43,364
 Vice Chairman Jin Dong Ki and other owner's family 

979
01:19:43,364 --> 01:19:44,565
 held a press conference. 

980
01:19:44,565 --> 01:19:46,335
 They announced they will step down 

981
01:19:46,335 --> 01:19:50,474
 from managing the businesses as of this day. 

982
01:19:50,474 --> 01:19:53,344
   

983
01:19:53,344 --> 01:19:56,174
   

984
01:19:56,174 --> 01:19:59,215
 Hence, the great-grandson of the former chairman 

985
01:19:59,215 --> 01:20:00,755
 will not succeed the group, 

986
01:20:00,755 --> 01:20:05,155
 and they'll also join an extensive ethics recovery program. 

987
01:20:05,155 --> 01:20:06,925
   

988
01:20:06,925 --> 01:20:09,395
 The special prosecutor also plans on conducting 

989
01:20:09,395 --> 01:20:12,324
 further investigation on the death of Jin Do Jun 

990
01:20:12,324 --> 01:20:14,574
 as it was exposed during the hearing. 

991
01:20:15,494 --> 01:20:17,234
 During the shareholders' meeting, 

992
01:20:17,234 --> 01:20:21,565
 Soonyang Group decided to leave the management to a management specialist. 

993
01:20:21,565 --> 01:20:24,345
 Stock prices for Soonyang and its affiliation 

994
01:20:24,345 --> 01:20:26,105
 finally began to rise in the market, 

995
01:20:26,105 --> 01:20:28,114
 closing up higher by the end of the day. 

996
01:20:28,114 --> 01:20:30,864
Everything unfolded just as you wanted.

997
01:20:32,645 --> 01:20:35,754
You took the Jin family's management rights

998
01:20:35,754 --> 01:20:39,324
without holding a single share in your hand.

999
01:20:41,455 --> 01:20:43,395
I couldn't make enough money

1000
01:20:43,395 --> 01:20:45,664
to buy enough shares in twenty years at Soonyang.

1001
01:20:45,664 --> 01:20:47,365
However,

1002
01:20:48,065 --> 01:20:53,204
I was fully trained on how the owner's family thinks and moves.

1003
01:20:53,204 --> 01:20:57,735
So allow me to buy that brain.

1004
01:21:06,244 --> 01:21:09,784
Yes, Father. I'm on my way home.

1005
01:21:09,784 --> 01:21:11,624
Would you like some fruit?

1006
01:21:11,624 --> 01:21:16,254
 I'm sorry I keep making you pay for things. 

1007
01:21:16,254 --> 01:21:21,065
I'm sorry that I'm late, but I'll be home for dinner.

1008
01:21:22,135 --> 01:21:25,394
Yes, I'll see you soon, Father.

1009
01:21:25,394 --> 01:21:27,104
Bye.

1010
01:21:32,675 --> 01:21:34,674
 I finally know now. 

1011
01:21:34,674 --> 01:21:37,945
 It wasn't possession or time traveling. 

1012
01:21:39,684 --> 01:21:47,045
 It was repentance. 

1013
01:21:47,045 --> 01:21:49,155
 My repentance for Jin Do Jun. 

1014
01:21:49,155 --> 01:21:53,954
 And repentance... 

1015
01:21:55,364 --> 01:21:59,665
 for me, Yoon Hyeon Woo. 

1016
01:22:10,744 --> 01:22:12,585
Yes, CEO Oh.

1017
01:22:13,444 --> 01:22:16,215
I hear Daeyoung adopted all kinds of expedients

1018
01:22:16,215 --> 01:22:19,415
to leave the group to the next generation.

1019
01:22:20,255 --> 01:22:21,695
Exactly.

1020
01:22:21,695 --> 01:22:25,664
As long as taxes are paid, there is no problem in inheriting one's assets.

1021
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:28,164
The problem is succeeding management rights.

1022
01:22:29,935 --> 01:22:33,935
CEO Oh, let me call you back.

1023
01:22:33,935 --> 01:22:35,505
Bye.

1024
01:22:39,005 --> 01:22:43,210
   

1025
01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:49,990
Final Credits

1026
01:22:49,990 --> 01:22:56,020
Final Credits

1027
01:22:56,020 --> 01:23:02,240
Final Credits

1028
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:04,135
Have you been well?

1029
01:23:04,135 --> 01:23:05,735
Yes.

1030
01:23:07,935 --> 01:23:12,405
You're a bit different from the Prosecutor Seo I know.

1031
01:23:13,505 --> 01:23:17,755
Thanks to you, I graduated from my job as Soonyang's Grim Reaper.

1032
01:23:20,045 --> 01:23:22,155
You look better now.

1033
01:23:22,915 --> 01:23:24,854
Those clothes suit you.

1034
01:23:28,755 --> 01:23:32,065
   

1035
01:23:33,924 --> 01:23:35,980
Hey, Prosecutor Seo.

1036
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:40,960
 Thank you for watching "Reborn Rich"   

1037

1042
01:24:05,374 --> 01:24:07,765

1043
01:24:07,765 --> 01:24:09,965
