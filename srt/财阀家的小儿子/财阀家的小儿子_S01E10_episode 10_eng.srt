1
00:00:00,555 --> 00:00:01,725
   

2
00:00:01,725 --> 00:00:06,155
Anyone who sends a false tip to the prosecution is charged with obstruction of justice.

3
00:00:06,155 --> 00:00:07,265
   

4
00:00:07,265 --> 00:00:09,195
   

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,265
 What's the settlement cost for next month from the businesses in the department store? 

6
00:00:14,265 --> 00:00:16,835
 - 140 billion won ($140M), Ma'am. 
 - Make them into postdated checks. 

7
00:00:16,835 --> 00:00:18,376
 - Sorry? 
 - I'm going to invest 

8
00:00:18,376 --> 00:00:20,975
 those 140 billion won ($140M) into New Data Technology. 

9
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:22,176
 CEO Jin, that's the department store's... 

10
00:00:22,176 --> 00:00:26,076
 I am Soonyang Department Store, and Soonyang Department Store is me! 

11
00:00:26,076 --> 00:00:27,846
What's going on? That is Director Im's voice.

12
00:00:27,846 --> 00:00:30,385
- Director Im? Why? 
 - I have no idea.

13
00:00:30,385 --> 00:00:32,585
Can anyone reach Director Im right now?

14
00:00:32,585 --> 00:00:35,255
This recording was sent to the Prosecutors' Office

15
00:00:35,255 --> 00:00:39,126
by Ms. Im Myeong Sook, the former director of finance.

16
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,193
That was your voice, right?

17
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,672
So she secretly recorded our conversations? Director Im did?

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,844
Since when?

19
00:00:50,844 --> 00:00:55,172
I believe this clearly proves that you are indeed guilty of embezzlement.

20
00:01:00,052 --> 00:01:02,512
The false tip didn't come from Miracle.

21
00:01:03,222 --> 00:01:05,883
It came from you, CEO Jin.

22
00:01:13,893 --> 00:01:16,092
   

23
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,772
As for CEO Jin,

24
00:01:19,772 --> 00:01:23,573
I'm afraid the prosecutor's investigation of her embezzlement charges cannot be avoided.

25
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,972
Did you say the person who handed over evidence to the prosecutors

26
00:01:27,972 --> 00:01:31,012
is a director at the department store?

27
00:01:31,012 --> 00:01:33,613
I apologize, Sir.

28
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,453
When a dog bites its master,

29
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,593
whose fault is it?

30
00:01:48,593 --> 00:01:51,063
Try all you want. Five years? Ten years?

31
00:01:51,063 --> 00:01:53,633
No. Even if I have to rot in prison for 50 years,

32
00:01:53,633 --> 00:01:57,843
I will never hand over my shares to you.

33
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:05,613
Then I guess you'll end up rotting in prison, and the department store stock will become worthless.

34
00:02:05,613 --> 00:02:10,682
If you fail to pay off the promissory notes this month, the department store will go bankrupt.

35
00:02:10,682 --> 00:02:16,592
Then the creditors and banks will be the ones liquidating the subsidiaries that are of any worth.

36
00:02:16,592 --> 00:02:21,493
Do you think Grandfather would accept you back if you lose even the subsidiaries?

37
00:02:21,493 --> 00:02:25,102
Thanks to you, Uncle Chang Je's political career would be over too.

38
00:02:25,102 --> 00:02:27,372
Do you think he'll welcome you back?

39
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:33,143
This is your last chance. Hand over your department store shares.

40
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,512
Then I'll let you keep your dignity as Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's only daughter.

41
00:02:38,512 --> 00:02:41,253
The prosecutors making you pose in front of the cameras...

42
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:44,482
I do not want Grandfather to see that.

43
00:02:47,692 --> 00:02:51,062
Hey, why me? Why Soonyang Department Store?

44
00:02:51,062 --> 00:02:53,992
I never wronged you in any way!

45
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,202
You taught me.

46
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,103
 Don't you dare delude yourself into thinking that you can be a rightful heir. 

47
00:03:09,103 --> 00:03:10,642
 You guys... 

48
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:18,552
 are different from us. 

49
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,652
That I'd never be the rightful heir to Soonyang.

50
00:03:26,693 --> 00:03:28,763
   

51
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,333
Then I should buy it.

52
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,933
Like this.

53
00:03:50,023 --> 00:03:53,453
  &nbsp;
   

54
00:03:54,453 --> 00:03:57,662
   
   

55
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:13,443
   

56
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,612
It's an honor, Chairman. Please allow me to escort you.

57
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:30,000


58
00:04:34,492 --> 00:04:36,703
I heard you made my only daughter

59
00:04:36,703 --> 00:04:38,902
cry her eyes out

60
00:04:38,902 --> 00:04:41,573
so you could make this department store all yours.

61
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,473
But seeing how you hired a management specialist...

62
00:04:45,473 --> 00:04:49,943
Why? Do you not feel confident about running it after all?

63
00:04:54,510 --> 00:05:00,222
This furniture boutique's sales rose by 380 percent.

64
00:05:00,222 --> 00:05:02,292
We believe it's because people are finally

65
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:06,892
getting married and moving now that the economy is improving.

66
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:08,532
All right.

67
00:05:08,532 --> 00:05:11,632
Since you joined us, this furniture boutique

68
00:05:11,632 --> 00:05:15,603
has become one of the best-performing shops.

69
00:05:15,603 --> 00:05:18,542
Have you set the sales goal for next year?

70
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,843
What's the goal?

71
00:05:21,843 --> 00:05:26,212
Various indexes that directly affect furniture sales, such as the country's birthrate and marriage rate,

72
00:05:26,212 --> 00:05:29,283
keep on dropping drastically every year.

73
00:05:29,283 --> 00:05:32,422
We should be as conservative as possible when setting the goal...

74
00:05:32,422 --> 00:05:37,562
Do Jun, you should get this CEO of yours a pair of reading glasses.

75
00:05:37,562 --> 00:05:42,833
I guess his eyesight is bad. He can see one thing but not the other.

76
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,002
Pardon me?

77
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,733
Even if the population decreases, the number of single-person households will continue to rise.

78
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:55,642
In that case, instead of barely selling a couch to each household,

79
00:05:55,642 --> 00:06:00,442
we'll be able to sell a couch for each room.

80
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,083
What's your problem? Do you not want to earn money?

81
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,652
I was shortsighted, Chairman.

82
00:06:07,652 --> 00:06:09,552
Please forgive me.

83
00:06:14,963 --> 00:06:19,832
Get your calculations right. Once you have set the sales goal, submit it to me.

84
00:06:19,832 --> 00:06:21,002
Yes, Sir.

85
00:06:21,002 --> 00:06:24,232
How would you face your wife if you got fired before your contract ended?

86
00:06:31,982 --> 00:06:35,113
As for CEO Jin... It's not only circumstantial.

87
00:06:35,113 --> 00:06:37,023
We have firm evidence that she committed embezzlement.

88
00:06:37,023 --> 00:06:39,653
Yet you want me to wrap it up as a case of non-indictment?

89
00:06:39,653 --> 00:06:42,952
What's the problem? She paid back what she had embezzled.

90
00:06:42,952 --> 00:06:44,793
- Sir. 
 - Prosecutor Seo.

91
00:06:44,793 --> 00:06:48,233
You're young. Keep up with the trends, will you?

92
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:51,262
The ability to think flexibly is important in the 21st century.

93
00:06:51,262 --> 00:06:55,873
I always thought it was such a shame that we were settling for a punishment-focused justice system.

94
00:06:55,873 --> 00:07:00,842
It's about time the prosecution contributed to paving the way for reconciliation and forgiveness.

95
00:07:00,842 --> 00:07:04,742
While she lost 140 billion won  ($140M)  due to a speculative investment,

96
00:07:04,742 --> 00:07:08,382
a total of 37 businesses went bankrupt,

97
00:07:08,382 --> 00:07:12,223
and 946 people lost their jobs.

98
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:17,092
Has she compensated the victims for their suffering?

99
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,962
Reconciliation and forgiveness?

100
00:07:19,962 --> 00:07:23,692
Forcing the victims to forgive.

101
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:26,562
Do you call that restorative justice?

102
00:07:26,562 --> 00:07:29,433
Aren't you doing this because you wish to reconcile with Soonyang?

103
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:33,073
Look, Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong.

104
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,312
Prosecutors have the right to prosecute crimes.

105
00:07:37,312 --> 00:07:40,453
I'd like to exercise my rights and indict CEO Jin.

106
00:07:40,453 --> 00:07:43,852
Please help me, Sir.

107
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,463
This is why I don't like working with women.

108
00:07:55,463 --> 00:07:57,732
Hey, I bet you don't know

109
00:07:57,732 --> 00:08:01,333
why female prosecutors never get the key positions.

110
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,932
You never served in the army so you don't know how to work
in an organization.

111
00:08:03,932 --> 00:08:05,943
Article Seven of the Prosecutors' Office Act.

112
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,713
The Principle of Identity of Public Prosecutors. Don't you know?

113
00:08:08,713 --> 00:08:13,112
"Obey any order of your superiors." Just do as I say, you little brat!

114
00:08:18,252 --> 00:08:20,153
I should get going.

115
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,823
- Grandfather. 
 - Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine.

116
00:08:23,823 --> 00:08:26,563
- Are you all right? 
 - I'm totally fine. I'm okay.

117
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,642
- Here, have some water, Grandfather. 
 - What? Okay, thanks.

118
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,592
Hey, take a seat.

119
00:09:03,592 --> 00:09:04,932
Okay.

120
00:09:09,902 --> 00:09:12,803
Keep this to yourself, Do Jun.

121
00:09:16,213 --> 00:09:19,682
The doctors at Soonyang medical center wanted to run some tests on me,

122
00:09:19,682 --> 00:09:23,013
so I took some X-rays.

123
00:09:23,823 --> 00:09:27,553
What did the results say? Are you undergoing treatment?

124
00:09:29,723 --> 00:09:32,363
For others, only their organs show up on their X-rays.

125
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:38,533
But below my chest, I have three things that others don't have.

126
00:09:39,433 --> 00:09:41,032
Here resides my greed for money.

127
00:09:41,032 --> 00:09:44,403
Here lies my distrust of those who work for me.

128
00:09:44,403 --> 00:09:46,872
And down here...

129
00:09:46,872 --> 00:09:49,242
is where you'd find

130
00:09:49,242 --> 00:09:52,043
my ability

131
00:09:52,043 --> 00:09:54,583
to betray anyone,

132
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,653
anytime.

133
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,133
You see,

134
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:16,173
I grew Soonyang into what it is today with those three things.

135
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,542
Did you say you wanted to buy Soonyang?

136
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,183
You won't be able to,

137
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:29,483
if all you've got is what everyone else has.

138
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:46,432
Let them do the work.

139
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:53,332
But never trust them.

140
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,542
Hwa Young ended up in that mess because she trusted her employees.

141
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,052
Do not trust anyone.

142
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,063
Do not open up to anyone.

143
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,533
If you do, it'll end up

144
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,832
becoming nothing but your weakness.

145
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,542
You little rascal.

146
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,583
I'm off.

147
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:46,963
Then I may distrust you and betray you too, Grandfather.

148
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,633
Will that be okay?

149
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,542
Do Jun.

150
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:08,283
Do you think I trust you?

151
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,992
Oh, Dear.

152
00:12:42,812 --> 00:12:45,682
The case has been reassigned to a different prosecutor.

153
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,192
It's obvious.

154
00:12:47,192 --> 00:12:48,723
You're a woman of principle.

155
00:12:48,723 --> 00:12:51,792
You'd never blindly obey Chief,

156
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:54,293
so I bet this was the only way.

157
00:12:59,302 --> 00:13:01,672
I know you worked hard on the case.

158
00:13:01,672 --> 00:13:04,602
I'm sorry this happened.

159
00:13:04,602 --> 00:13:08,442
This means I won't have to work late for a while. This is great.

160
00:13:09,642 --> 00:13:12,642
Well, since we have nothing to do today,

161
00:13:12,642 --> 00:13:15,253
why don't we leave right on the dot for once?

162
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,782
Like other civil servants.

163
00:13:16,782 --> 00:13:19,122
Bye, I'm off.

164
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:34,472
Let's meet up.

165
00:13:47,713 --> 00:13:51,422
You knew from the beginning.

166
00:13:52,353 --> 00:13:55,393
That I wouldn't be able to indict CEO Jin,

167
00:13:55,393 --> 00:13:58,223
and that I'd have no choice but to let it go.

168
00:13:58,223 --> 00:14:00,593
This is the reason you suddenly showed up

169
00:14:00,593 --> 00:14:04,402
out of nowhere and gave me a tip.

170
00:14:04,402 --> 00:14:07,133
From beginning to end,

171
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:09,733
you used me.

172
00:14:10,373 --> 00:14:12,973
You knew from the beginning

173
00:14:14,642 --> 00:14:17,782
that I didn't tip you off for the sake of law and order.

174
00:14:17,782 --> 00:14:18,983
- Hey, that's... 
 - "Let me use..."

175
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,953
"a third-generation heir to realize justice."

176
00:14:21,953 --> 00:14:25,623
That's what you said. Don't you remember?

177
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:30,363
Hey, why are you so good with... You really do have a way with words.

178
00:14:30,363 --> 00:14:32,892
Do you take special lessons?

179
00:14:35,093 --> 00:14:37,062
 Do you take special lessons? 

180
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,702
 You're quite eloquent. 

181
00:14:42,402 --> 00:14:44,033
It is you.

182
00:14:45,402 --> 00:14:47,503
The Seo Min Yeong I know.

183
00:14:47,503 --> 00:14:50,013
Don't make that face.

184
00:14:51,213 --> 00:14:54,753
Those eyes and that face, as if you know everything about me.

185
00:14:55,453 --> 00:14:57,713
Don't do that.

186
00:14:59,052 --> 00:15:02,353
I nearly bought

187
00:15:02,353 --> 00:15:04,393
your lie.

188
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,963
"I'll become a great prosecutor"?

189
00:15:10,963 --> 00:15:13,032
When my boss told me I'd never be able to return

190
00:15:13,032 --> 00:15:16,372
to the Central Office if I got transferred because of this,

191
00:15:16,372 --> 00:15:18,103
I couldn't even say anything

192
00:15:18,103 --> 00:15:20,613
because I didn't want to grow old as a mediocre civil servant

193
00:15:20,613 --> 00:15:22,573
who had to pack up every two years

194
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:25,813
to transfer from a small-town office to another.

195
00:15:26,812 --> 00:15:29,753
I'm so cowardly and materialistic.

196
00:15:31,123 --> 00:15:33,682
Do you think I'll be a good prosecutor?

197
00:15:37,463 --> 00:15:40,763
I bet you have no idea how sly I can be.

198
00:15:40,763 --> 00:15:43,833
When they reassigned the case to someone else to reprimand me,

199
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:47,133
everyone else in the office was worried about me.

200
00:15:48,302 --> 00:15:52,973
But the truth is, I was so relieved

201
00:15:52,973 --> 00:15:56,672
because it meant that no one would ever find out

202
00:15:56,672 --> 00:15:59,512
how cowardly and servile I was

203
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:02,452
in front of my boss.

204
00:16:16,632 --> 00:16:19,503
Why are you telling me all this?

205
00:16:24,543 --> 00:16:26,173
I wonder, too.

206
00:16:27,743 --> 00:16:31,042
I always let you see right through me.

207
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:32,913
From the very beginning...

208
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:38,623
I should get going before I give more away.

209
00:16:40,823 --> 00:16:43,663
I won't be a great prosecutor,

210
00:16:43,663 --> 00:16:46,093
which means

211
00:16:46,093 --> 00:16:48,493
you lied to me.

212
00:17:09,082 --> 00:17:11,783
   

213
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:32,772
- My gosh. 
 - Seriously?

214
00:17:32,772 --> 00:17:34,072
Oh, my.

215
00:17:34,072 --> 00:17:36,972
- I can't believe this. 
 - Me, neither.

216
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:40,583
- Is this really happening? 
 - My gosh!

217
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,053
Isn't he so cool?

218
00:17:42,053 --> 00:17:43,982
- This feels so surreal. 
 - I know.

219
00:17:43,982 --> 00:17:46,322
- I knew it. 
 - I love him so much.

220
00:17:46,322 --> 00:17:48,592
My gosh.

221
00:17:48,592 --> 00:17:51,963
- Oh, my. 
 - This is so cool.

222
00:18:11,982 --> 00:18:13,543
Min Yeong.

223
00:18:18,122 --> 00:18:20,053
Who says

224
00:18:20,053 --> 00:18:22,453
I lied to you?

225
00:18:30,563 --> 00:18:32,380
Let's go.

226
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:36,840
♫   The beads of sweat on my forehead,   ♫

227
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:44,200
♫   the tiring day has made me forget everything   ♫

228
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:51,110
♫   Your warm way of speaking,   ♫

229
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:58,570
♫   the look in your eyes makes me fall in love   ♫

230
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,990
♫  Like a star, even in the deep ♫  

231
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:16,620
♫   in the darkness, the person who shines the brightest   ♫

232
00:19:21,412 --> 00:19:24,083
I wanted to show you.

233
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,652
What?

234
00:19:26,952 --> 00:19:28,552
Look.

235
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,180
♫  Like a star ♫  

236
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,330
♫  Like a star ♫  

237
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,643
 Seo Tai Ji 

238
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,643
   

239
00:19:56,882 --> 00:19:58,752
Do you still think

240
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,153
I lied to you?

241
00:20:09,592 --> 00:20:11,963
If you can't trust yourself,

242
00:20:13,263 --> 00:20:15,403
just trust me, Min Yeong.

243
00:20:17,203 --> 00:20:19,543
The Seo Min Yeong I know

244
00:20:19,543 --> 00:20:21,770
will become a great prosecutor. I'm sure of it.

245
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:30,810
♫  Like a star, even in the deep darkness ♫  

246
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:36,700
♫   You are the person who shines the brightest   ♫

247
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:44,000
♫  In the distant future it will be remembered, that we were everything to each other   ♫

248
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,300
♫   Every day is a miracle  ♫

249
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,602
I told you to stop looking at me like that...

250
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:56,320
♫   Like a star, you  ♫

251
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,400
♫   Like a star in my heart ♫

252
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,640
♫ You are my dazzling person ♫

253
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,360
♫  I will remember you in my heart  ♫

254
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,370
♫   in your most beautiful form  ♫

255
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:17,800
♫  As that light that can’t be extinguished,  ♫

256
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,040
♫  like a star. ♫

257
00:21:28,213 --> 00:21:31,283
 The foreign exchange crisis, also known as the IMF crisis 

258
00:21:31,283 --> 00:21:35,083
 that occurred 3 years and 8 months ago has officially ended today. 

259
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:39,052
 We have officially graduated from IMF. 

260
00:21:39,052 --> 00:21:42,693
 Once again, I deeply express my gratitude. 
   

261
00:21:42,693 --> 00:21:45,493
 Babies' first-birthday rings and wedding rings came out of wardrobes, 

262
00:21:45,493 --> 00:21:48,092
 and people collected dollars cooperatively. 

263
00:21:48,092 --> 00:21:52,833
 But as corporate restructuring started due to sovereign default, 

264
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,632
 jobless and homeless people increased exponentially. 

265
00:21:55,632 --> 00:21:57,232
 By working our fingers to the bone 

266
00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:00,243
 and repaying the IMF debt of 19.5 billion dollars today, 

267
00:22:00,243 --> 00:22:01,943
 the economic indicators 

268
00:22:01,943 --> 00:22:03,542
 such as foreign exchange reserve increase improved, 

269
00:22:03,542 --> 00:22:06,343
 and foreigner investors have returned as well. 

270
00:22:07,553 --> 00:22:10,383
Does this make sense?

271
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:16,322
The redemption period Korea promised IMF was 2004, which is three years later.

272
00:22:16,322 --> 00:22:21,422
Nobody from Wall Street expected Korea to repay the debt this fast.

273
00:22:21,422 --> 00:22:23,992
Can you explain this?

274
00:22:23,992 --> 00:22:25,532
Didn't you know?

275
00:22:25,532 --> 00:22:28,603
It is Koreans' hobby to overcome a national crisis.

276
00:22:28,603 --> 00:22:31,202
No. What I mean is,

277
00:22:31,202 --> 00:22:34,143
how could you have been the only one who predicted this accurately?

278
00:22:34,143 --> 00:22:37,342
Just like when IMF started.

279
00:22:38,413 --> 00:22:40,312
Do you know what's the strangest?

280
00:22:40,312 --> 00:22:43,112
You don't get excited at all.

281
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:44,582
If I were you, I wouldn't be here.

282
00:22:44,582 --> 00:22:46,522
If the world moved as I predicted,

283
00:22:46,522 --> 00:22:52,522
I would have died from my heart exploding or would have been jailed for leading a cult.

284
00:22:52,522 --> 00:22:54,492
Calm down.

285
00:22:56,962 --> 00:23:00,332
How can you stay so calm at that age?

286
00:23:00,332 --> 00:23:03,173
It's as if you lived through this world.

287
00:23:05,102 --> 00:23:08,472
Is that it?

288
00:23:08,472 --> 00:23:11,943
Are you from another star? A goblin?

289
00:23:11,943 --> 00:23:14,012
Don't laugh at his jokes.

290
00:23:14,012 --> 00:23:16,813
It's Miracle Investment's investment rule.

291
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:20,622
You need to keep your cool when evaluating performance.

292
00:23:20,622 --> 00:23:22,692
I looked into it with a cool head.

293
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:25,593
Wouldn't the president who even won the Nobel Peace Prize

294
00:23:25,593 --> 00:23:30,532
want to secure the title of finishing IMF early, no matter what?

295
00:23:30,532 --> 00:23:32,803
- Especially before... 
 - The presidential election.

296
00:23:32,803 --> 00:23:34,432
The presidential election next year.

297
00:23:34,432 --> 00:23:36,303
So?

298
00:23:36,303 --> 00:23:41,603
As expected, all economic policies were focused on securing dollars.

299
00:23:41,603 --> 00:23:45,013
By opening the market to foreign investors?

300
00:23:45,013 --> 00:23:46,513
Yes.

301
00:23:48,582 --> 00:23:52,823
From now on, money will decide companies' big and small events.

302
00:23:52,823 --> 00:23:54,823
And that will be

303
00:23:55,852 --> 00:24:01,953
a good opportunity for Miracle.

304
00:24:08,432 --> 00:24:14,310
   

305
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:22,113
Everyone, you did well paying off the country's debt.

306
00:24:22,113 --> 00:24:24,553
So what if the country paid off the debt?

307
00:24:24,553 --> 00:24:29,453
They keep bringing up financial solvency to meet the standard of the IMF.

308
00:24:29,453 --> 00:24:32,362
How can we do business when the bank loan rate is so high?

309
00:24:32,362 --> 00:24:38,232
Immediate cash flow is more important than companies' growth potential.

310
00:24:39,703 --> 00:24:44,303
Do you know what all this means?

311
00:24:45,302 --> 00:24:48,043
The manufacturing industries are now dead.

312
00:24:48,043 --> 00:24:51,742
We must start a moneylending business to survive.

313
00:24:51,742 --> 00:24:55,052
Not manufacturing, but finance.

314
00:24:55,052 --> 00:25:00,083
By finance, do you mean insurance and investment?

315
00:25:00,953 --> 00:25:06,093
Here is the plan for establishing Soonyang Financial Holding Company as instructed.

316
00:25:08,462 --> 00:25:11,363
By Soonyang Financial Holding Company, you mean...

317
00:25:11,363 --> 00:25:14,673
Soonyang Investment, Card, Life Insurance, Savings and so on.

318
00:25:14,673 --> 00:25:17,703
To strengthen the affiliates related to finance,

319
00:25:17,703 --> 00:25:21,772
he's planning to set up a financial holding company.

320
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:24,882
That's why you transferred 34 percent of Soonyang Card's share

321
00:25:24,882 --> 00:25:29,613
that was owned by Soonyang Electronics to Soonyang Insurance?

322
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:34,353
To set up a financial holding company separate from manufacturing?

323
00:25:37,393 --> 00:25:41,623
It was unexpected of him to set up Soonyang Financial Holding Company.

324
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,792
Chairman Jin finally gave in.

325
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:48,902
To follow the political regulation of separation of Finance that states conglomerates cannot own Finance.

326
00:25:49,702 --> 00:25:53,003
That's merely a justification.

327
00:25:53,003 --> 00:25:56,573
He's thinking of something else on the inside, that old man!

328
00:25:58,112 --> 00:26:00,913
Did you not hear what Medical Director Jung of the Soonyang medical center say?

329
00:26:00,913 --> 00:26:07,782
There's a time bomb in my father's head.

330
00:26:07,782 --> 00:26:11,153
There's a reason he is in a rush.

331
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,862
- Then why... 
 - Think about it.

332
00:26:13,862 --> 00:26:16,333
What will happen if Soonyang Financial Holding Company

333
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:19,303
secures just five percent of Soonyang Corporation?

334
00:26:19,303 --> 00:26:22,502
It can exert influence on every manufacturing affiliate

335
00:26:22,502 --> 00:26:25,642
- under Soonyang Corporation. 
 - Bingo.

336
00:26:25,642 --> 00:26:28,213
The owner of the financial holding company

337
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:35,213
will become the owner of Soonyang Group. That's what I'm talking about.

338
00:26:35,213 --> 00:26:37,682
   

339
00:26:43,093 --> 00:26:45,723
It would be perfect for Seong Jun to take a position

340
00:26:45,723 --> 00:26:49,293
in the financial holding company.

341
00:26:55,802 --> 00:26:58,702
Hyeon Min is doing her best every day

342
00:26:58,702 --> 00:27:01,403
to soothe your anger.

343
00:27:01,403 --> 00:27:06,342
Seong Jun repented a lot for the past two years.

344
00:27:09,283 --> 00:27:11,553
Look, Father.

345
00:27:13,223 --> 00:27:14,923
   

346
00:27:14,923 --> 00:27:19,723
He's getting along really well with the employees and is down-to-earth

347
00:27:20,763 --> 00:27:26,063
that most employees don't know that he is your eldest grandson.

348
00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:30,402
The distribution warehouse has the highest sales as well.

349
00:27:31,842 --> 00:27:33,743
You're right.

350
00:27:34,643 --> 00:27:37,073
He's getting along well.

351
00:27:38,743 --> 00:27:41,312
Tell him to stay there.

352
00:27:43,153 --> 00:27:45,582
It suits him perfectly.

353
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:50,053
I'm too ashamed to see my daughter-in-law, that's why.

354
00:27:51,063 --> 00:27:54,462
 Father, please. 

355
00:27:56,533 --> 00:27:57,833
Welcome.

356
00:27:57,833 --> 00:28:00,163
- Welcome back. 
 - Welcome back.

357
00:28:02,372 --> 00:28:04,303
Hello, Hyeon Min.

358
00:28:04,303 --> 00:28:06,503
You're here, Aunt Ji Na.

359
00:28:06,503 --> 00:28:08,842
Why do you look so dull?

360
00:28:08,842 --> 00:28:11,313
Living with your in-laws must be hard.

361
00:28:11,943 --> 00:28:16,382
Tell me about it. You have both mother-in-law and grandmother-in-law.

362
00:28:16,913 --> 00:28:22,552
Your grandmother-in-law is difficult, and your mother-in-law is fussy.

363
00:28:22,552 --> 00:28:27,523
On top of that, your aunt-in-law is rude.

364
00:28:27,523 --> 00:28:29,532
- Jeong Rae. 
 - Hyeon Min.

365
00:28:29,532 --> 00:28:33,262
How are you managing your facial expression that you get such a comment?

366
00:28:33,262 --> 00:28:35,703
Remember you're living with your grandparents-in-law.

367
00:28:35,703 --> 00:28:36,872
I'm sorry.

368
00:28:36,872 --> 00:28:39,403
Why are you scolding her?

369
00:28:39,403 --> 00:28:41,072
I'm the one you dislike.

370
00:28:41,072 --> 00:28:43,413
You know that well.

371
00:28:44,112 --> 00:28:48,283
If you have anything to say to her, tell me instead.

372
00:28:48,283 --> 00:28:50,513
- Okay. 
 - She already has it hard with her in-laws.

373
00:28:50,513 --> 00:28:51,953
You don't need to add to that.

374
00:28:51,953 --> 00:28:53,982
Sure.

375
00:28:56,952 --> 00:29:02,333
Why would you take your sorrow of not having a son out on her?

376
00:29:05,002 --> 00:29:11,932
If I talk to you, would you even understand?

377
00:29:11,932 --> 00:29:14,102
A special exhibition of Yun Hyong Keun

378
00:29:14,102 --> 00:29:17,983
and Park Seo Bo will be held at Hyeon Min's gallery,

379
00:29:17,983 --> 00:29:20,112
so I wanted to buy some paintings.

380
00:29:20,112 --> 00:29:22,612
Do you even know

381
00:29:22,612 --> 00:29:27,752
what monochrome painting or abstract art is?

382
00:29:27,752 --> 00:29:30,622
What about pointillism?

383
00:29:30,622 --> 00:29:37,123
The only art you know is the oriental art on your cushion.

384
00:29:49,772 --> 00:29:52,712
- Are you done talking? 
 - Yes.

385
00:30:13,403 --> 00:30:15,203
Oh my god.

386
00:30:15,203 --> 00:30:17,872
What are you doing? You're so uncultured!

387
00:30:17,872 --> 00:30:21,013
Yes! I'm the daughter of a private loan market's financer,

388
00:30:21,013 --> 00:30:24,013
and you're the daughter of a finance minister.

389
00:30:24,013 --> 00:30:27,013
Seong Jun is going through this hardship because of you!

390
00:30:28,712 --> 00:30:31,353
What do you think you are doing?

391
00:30:33,223 --> 00:30:35,493
Your father is here.

392
00:30:43,263 --> 00:30:45,503
Mother.

393
00:30:46,503 --> 00:30:48,332
Jeong Rae.

394
00:30:49,073 --> 00:30:51,703
Did you do this to her?

395
00:30:52,542 --> 00:30:56,573
It's me, Grandmother. I did it.

396
00:30:59,783 --> 00:31:02,183
Excuse me, bring the cleaning equipment.

397
00:31:02,183 --> 00:31:04,013
Yes, Ma'am.

398
00:31:17,263 --> 00:31:18,963
You did?

399
00:31:18,963 --> 00:31:23,532
I stumbled while I was walking down the stairs.

400
00:31:24,372 --> 00:31:27,472
I'm sorry for making a fuss.

401
00:31:27,472 --> 00:31:30,613
Are you okay, Aunt Ji Na?

402
00:31:30,613 --> 00:31:32,482
Hyeon Min.

403
00:31:33,082 --> 00:31:34,713
Come to my gallery.

404
00:31:34,713 --> 00:31:37,552
I'll give you a nice painting as a present.

405
00:31:38,382 --> 00:31:43,852
Mother really liked the monochrome paintings of Painter Park Seo Bo as well.

406
00:31:43,852 --> 00:31:48,162
Because she could feel the ascetic life of the painter.

407
00:32:25,463 --> 00:32:28,002
Do you think this makes sense?

408
00:32:28,002 --> 00:32:31,232
Do you know Jung Hee Gu, the pyramid scheme financial scammer?

409
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:35,302
I just came back from interviewing the victim, and it's a total nightmare for them.

410
00:32:35,302 --> 00:32:36,343
She invested 250 millions won  ($250k) 

411
00:32:36,343 --> 00:32:39,913
which was her daughter's death benefit, but she couldn't get back a cent.

412
00:32:39,913 --> 00:32:41,713
But Jung Hee Gu, that jerk,

413
00:32:41,713 --> 00:32:45,653
won't even get punished because he died in Southeast Asia.

414
00:32:45,653 --> 00:32:48,552
Imagine how wronged she feels. It was her daughter's death benefit.

415
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:50,123
Don't you think so?

416
00:32:50,123 --> 00:32:52,193
I see.

417
00:32:52,193 --> 00:32:54,163
You worked hard.

418
00:32:55,562 --> 00:32:58,533
Being late for forty minutes is not bad.

419
00:33:00,832 --> 00:33:03,203
Thank you.

420
00:33:07,973 --> 00:33:11,172
I know you're late from listening to her story.

421
00:33:12,542 --> 00:33:14,882
So stop being sorry, and let's eat.

422
00:33:16,013 --> 00:33:19,182
When did you order?

423
00:33:19,182 --> 00:33:20,552
Just now.

424
00:33:20,552 --> 00:33:23,193
When you were running and fixing your makeup.

425
00:33:24,393 --> 00:33:26,023
I don't get it.

426
00:33:26,023 --> 00:33:27,623
What do you mean?

427
00:33:27,623 --> 00:33:30,363
Why do you need to fix your makeup when you're pretty?

428
00:33:33,063 --> 00:33:35,132
Eat up.

429
00:33:37,772 --> 00:33:39,873
Thank you.

430
00:33:47,982 --> 00:33:50,112
What a world.

431
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:56,322
The damage was over four trillion won  ($4B) , and there were over 70,000 innocent victims.

432
00:33:56,322 --> 00:33:57,793
But in the end,

433
00:33:57,793 --> 00:34:00,923
the case was closed for not having the authority to file prosecution.

434
00:34:00,923 --> 00:34:03,433
Capital market runs

435
00:34:03,433 --> 00:34:08,263
on an appropriate amount of ignorance and greed.

436
00:34:12,902 --> 00:34:17,373
Is Miracle Investment in that market as well?

437
00:34:22,112 --> 00:34:25,553
Why? Are you worried?

438
00:34:28,723 --> 00:34:33,123
That I might stand in front of you as a suspect?

439
00:34:52,413 --> 00:34:55,212
You know New Data Technology, right?

440
00:34:55,212 --> 00:34:57,313
I heard it was under investigation.

441
00:34:57,313 --> 00:35:02,123
They are investigating accounting fraud and matched orders.

442
00:35:03,292 --> 00:35:04,822
We received a complaint.

443
00:35:04,822 --> 00:35:07,123
A third-generation conglomerate family member

444
00:35:07,123 --> 00:35:08,933
is one of the people who manipulated stock prices.

445
00:35:08,933 --> 00:35:11,663
The rich are always greedier.

446
00:35:11,663 --> 00:35:13,663
Prosecutor Seo, take charge of the case from search and seizure.

447
00:35:13,663 --> 00:35:16,033
It's a sensitive matter.

448
00:35:16,902 --> 00:35:19,373
It says whose son he is, right?

449
00:35:23,542 --> 00:35:26,243
Did they write the news without checking the facts?

450
00:35:26,243 --> 00:35:27,182
Which newspaper company is it?

451
00:35:27,182 --> 00:35:31,813
Hyunsung Daily released it on the internet first, saying it's exclusive news.

452
00:35:31,813 --> 00:35:32,853
Hyunsung Daily?

453
00:35:32,853 --> 00:35:35,010
Now, evening economic newspapers will follow suit

454
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:38,490
and the 9 p.m. news will become their speakers.

455
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:40,363
Look.

456
00:35:43,563 --> 00:35:46,403
   

457
00:35:46,403 --> 00:35:47,703
   

458
00:35:47,703 --> 00:35:50,433
What operation? Does this make sense? Me?

459
00:35:50,433 --> 00:35:53,402
We got dragged into their operation.

460
00:35:55,442 --> 00:35:56,573
We're from the prosecution.

461
00:35:56,573 --> 00:35:59,913
Stop what you're doing and get up from your seat.

462
00:35:59,913 --> 00:36:02,513
Everyone, stand up.

463
00:36:24,873 --> 00:36:29,243
I'm Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong of FTCD at Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

464
00:36:29,243 --> 00:36:32,083
We received a complaint saying Miracle Investment

465
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:38,183
was systematically involved in the stock price manipulation of New Data Technology.

466
00:36:38,183 --> 00:36:40,223
Mr. Song.

467
00:36:43,552 --> 00:36:46,223
   

468
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:53,932
Will you cooperate?

469
00:36:57,532 --> 00:37:03,642
Based on the information you tipped off, the prosecution is investigating.

470
00:37:03,642 --> 00:37:05,813
Isn't it strange?

471
00:37:05,813 --> 00:37:07,543
Do Jun

472
00:37:07,543 --> 00:37:13,552
sold off all of his shares of New Data Technology right before the stock price plummeted.

473
00:37:13,552 --> 00:37:14,583
As if he knew

474
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:19,393
what was going to happen after that.

475
00:37:20,563 --> 00:37:25,462
Internal trading using private information?

476
00:37:26,603 --> 00:37:31,002
He was able to set a perfect trap for my wife because of that too?

477
00:37:34,842 --> 00:37:36,843
Anyway,

478
00:37:36,843 --> 00:37:41,042
deal with him well so that Hwa Young doesn't feel wronged.

479
00:37:41,042 --> 00:37:44,883
But it is against the securities exchange act,

480
00:37:44,883 --> 00:37:46,523
but it won't be easy.

481
00:37:46,523 --> 00:37:49,552
It's always hard to prove that

482
00:37:49,552 --> 00:37:53,822
they used internal information at the point of trading.

483
00:37:53,822 --> 00:37:56,432
Does that matter?

484
00:37:56,432 --> 00:37:59,763
A trial doesn't only take place in court.

485
00:38:02,903 --> 00:38:03,832
I see.

486
00:38:03,832 --> 00:38:06,203
Why did he manipulate the stock price? What does he lack?

487
00:38:06,203 --> 00:38:08,002
Why did the stock price drop so drastically?

488
00:38:08,002 --> 00:38:10,672
   

489
00:38:10,672 --> 00:38:12,912
The family of a conglomerate is killing off all the small investors.

490
00:38:12,912 --> 00:38:14,242
   

491
00:38:14,242 --> 00:38:16,513
   

492
00:38:18,113 --> 00:38:21,022
 An official says other than Mr. Jin of a certain company, 

493
00:38:21,022 --> 00:38:24,352
 three more heirs of conglomerates are suspected to be involved, 

494
00:38:24,352 --> 00:38:25,993
 but it is not easy to prove the charge against them, 

495
00:38:25,993 --> 00:38:29,232
 so it will be difficult to investigate openly. 

496
00:38:29,232 --> 00:38:31,363
 The stock price manipulation... 

497
00:38:43,743 --> 00:38:46,142
Are you holding a court of public opinion first?

498
00:38:46,142 --> 00:38:49,343
When the prosecutor in charge just started?

499
00:38:49,343 --> 00:38:50,782
Am I that unreliable?

500
00:38:50,782 --> 00:38:52,722
Or are you not confident of this case?

501
00:38:52,722 --> 00:38:54,482
He's the third-generation heir of Soonyang.

502
00:38:54,482 --> 00:38:57,122
Public opinion must boil up so we can keep pace until the trial.

503
00:38:57,122 --> 00:39:01,823
You're relying on whimsical public opinion because you're afraid of Soonyang?

504
00:39:01,823 --> 00:39:04,362
You're a prosecutor, at that. How embarrassing.

505
00:39:04,362 --> 00:39:06,462
Hey, Prosecutor Seo.

506
00:39:06,462 --> 00:39:08,333
You...

507
00:39:10,103 --> 00:39:12,143
- What? 
 - Starting tomorrow morning,

508
00:39:12,143 --> 00:39:14,703
don't share internal information with reporters in a sauna.

509
00:39:14,703 --> 00:39:19,212
Publication of facts of suspected crime is strictly illegal.

510
00:39:19,212 --> 00:39:23,182
I'm going to do my best

511
00:39:23,182 --> 00:39:27,582
and investigate the case thoroughly so that the judgment of the law will be enough.

512
00:39:29,952 --> 00:39:31,593
Why you little...

513
00:39:37,063 --> 00:39:39,402
It's not true.

514
00:39:39,402 --> 00:39:41,462
I mean it. We're not involved.

515
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,632
It's a temporary issue.

516
00:39:43,632 --> 00:39:45,373
That news is false.

517
00:39:45,373 --> 00:39:46,703
Hold on.

518
00:39:46,703 --> 00:39:49,572
I'm going to repeat what you just said.

519
00:39:49,572 --> 00:39:51,842
You want to cancel...

520
00:39:51,842 --> 00:39:55,182
Of course. I will return your investment according to the process.

521
00:39:55,182 --> 00:39:58,653
Miracle Investment won't be shaken just from this.

522
00:39:58,653 --> 00:40:00,510
As you know, there aren't many investment companies

523
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,820
in the market that makes as much profit as us.

524
00:40:05,123 --> 00:40:07,362
Okay. I'm hanging up.

525
00:40:11,763 --> 00:40:13,833
I gave it a thought.

526
00:40:14,663 --> 00:40:19,302
They attacked us with New Data Technology and even moved the prosecution,

527
00:40:19,302 --> 00:40:22,843
so I thought it was CEO Jin Hwa Young taking revenge.

528
00:40:22,843 --> 00:40:24,072
But no.

529
00:40:24,072 --> 00:40:26,242
They know about the flow of our stock tradings in detail.

530
00:40:26,242 --> 00:40:28,912
- That means... 
 - Yes.

531
00:40:28,912 --> 00:40:32,123
It's Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki of Soonyang Investment.

532
00:40:32,123 --> 00:40:36,082
If you meet him, tell him that his operation was successful.

533
00:40:39,762 --> 00:40:44,533
How many people want their investment returned?

534
00:40:45,103 --> 00:40:49,333
For rich people, security is as important as the rate of return.

535
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:52,802
A scandal like this is critical.

536
00:40:52,802 --> 00:40:54,543
Exactly.

537
00:40:56,743 --> 00:40:58,942
How much is it?

538
00:41:00,482 --> 00:41:01,652
Hello, Sir.

539
00:41:01,652 --> 00:41:03,013
Is Grandfather upstairs?

540
00:41:03,013 --> 00:41:05,383
- Yes. 
 - Thank you.

541
00:41:18,433 --> 00:41:22,732
Grandfather is very worried about you.

542
00:41:23,302 --> 00:41:27,203
I'm finding out just how strong Hyunsung Daily is.

543
00:41:27,203 --> 00:41:32,212
If you need my help, tell me anytime.

544
00:41:32,212 --> 00:41:34,313
We're family.

545
00:41:37,782 --> 00:41:40,652
Thank you. I'll keep that in mind.

546
00:41:40,652 --> 00:41:44,493
You should go inside. The elders must be waiting.

547
00:41:59,442 --> 00:42:03,673
Is it true?

548
00:42:03,673 --> 00:42:05,543
Well...

549
00:42:06,183 --> 00:42:09,652
I never considered stock manipulation, Grandfather.

550
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:17,782
What I made from New Data Technology was just average by Miracle's standards.

551
00:42:18,493 --> 00:42:20,362
Then...

552
00:42:21,063 --> 00:42:23,362
is this innocent kid

553
00:42:23,362 --> 00:42:27,333
being harassed by the joint forces of the media and prosecution?

554
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:29,873
My own grandson?

555
00:42:31,703 --> 00:42:33,702
They should know better.

556
00:42:33,702 --> 00:42:36,813
Do you want me to call Chief Prosecutor Park at the Central Prosecutors' Office?

557
00:42:36,813 --> 00:42:39,982
You can't do that, not in this day and age.

558
00:42:39,982 --> 00:42:41,712
Just one missed call from you

559
00:42:41,712 --> 00:42:45,482
will make them say we're invading their right to investigate.

560
00:42:45,482 --> 00:42:48,552
Is that what you want them to say, Father?

561
00:42:51,122 --> 00:42:52,923
Right now,

562
00:42:53,623 --> 00:42:58,063
the investigation isn't what our Do Jun should be worrying about.

563
00:42:58,063 --> 00:43:01,802
Miracle's investors are calling, demanding refunds.

564
00:43:01,802 --> 00:43:04,733
They want their money back.

565
00:43:04,733 --> 00:43:08,803
It'll be too much for him to handle it on his own.

566
00:43:08,803 --> 00:43:11,913
Miracle must handle a massive amount of cash.

567
00:43:11,913 --> 00:43:13,842
He can't retrieve it all immediately.

568
00:43:13,842 --> 00:43:19,282
How much longer do you think he can survive without an influx of capital?

569
00:43:20,052 --> 00:43:24,492
What do you think will happen if he can't return the investments?

570
00:43:24,492 --> 00:43:27,523
Soonyang will be the one to take the hit.

571
00:43:27,523 --> 00:43:31,593
They'll say the financial market isn't a playground for the rich.

572
00:43:33,033 --> 00:43:35,262
Then what?

573
00:43:35,262 --> 00:43:37,333
Do you have a solution?

574
00:43:42,112 --> 00:43:49,343
Miracle Investment... Soonyang Investment will acquire the company.

575
00:43:51,413 --> 00:43:54,083
Let's turn it into a PR coup, Father.

576
00:43:57,853 --> 00:44:02,523
An uncle who took responsibility for his nephew's errors.

577
00:44:02,523 --> 00:44:06,163
If Soonyang gets involved, the investors will calm down,

578
00:44:06,163 --> 00:44:08,333
and they'll stop demanding a refund.

579
00:44:08,333 --> 00:44:10,632
If Soonyang Investment takes over Miracle,

580
00:44:10,632 --> 00:44:13,602
financial authorities will stop complaining we're amassing

581
00:44:13,602 --> 00:44:17,812
a slush fund or that we must be investigated for tax evasion.

582
00:44:29,223 --> 00:44:31,823
It makes sense.

583
00:44:33,192 --> 00:44:35,563
- Grandfather... 
 - Dong Ki.

584
00:44:36,433 --> 00:44:38,362
Then...

585
00:44:39,362 --> 00:44:45,963
you'd better pay Do Jun the right price.

586
00:44:45,963 --> 00:44:47,642
Yes.

587
00:44:48,343 --> 00:44:49,743
Good.

588
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:52,743
That's done.

589
00:44:54,013 --> 00:44:55,712
Grandfather.

590
00:44:56,513 --> 00:44:59,023
All I need right now is time.

591
00:44:59,023 --> 00:45:03,122
Once the prosecutors realize I didn't manipulate the stock price,

592
00:45:03,122 --> 00:45:06,423
everything will go back to normal.

593
00:45:07,362 --> 00:45:10,563
You don't have to worry about Miracle.

594
00:45:10,563 --> 00:45:12,332
Come on.

595
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:15,962
I'm not worried about you.

596
00:45:16,703 --> 00:45:20,942
It's Soonyang, me I'm worried about.

597
00:45:22,313 --> 00:45:23,913
Okay?

598
00:45:38,252 --> 00:45:41,722
We need 480 billion won  ($480M)  right away. There's no other way.

599
00:45:41,722 --> 00:45:44,892
The Soonyang Department Store and Ahjin Motors shares we own.

600
00:45:44,892 --> 00:45:46,632
We have to sell them all.

601
00:45:46,632 --> 00:45:49,502
There's no guarantee we can liquidate it all.

602
00:45:49,502 --> 00:45:51,103
In the current market,

603
00:45:51,103 --> 00:45:55,302
finding someone with that much buying power will take time.

604
00:45:55,302 --> 00:45:57,743
What if we take longer and miss the repayment deadline?

605
00:45:57,743 --> 00:46:00,812
That could cause a massive delay.

606
00:46:02,353 --> 00:46:05,013
Will you say something? Anything.

607
00:46:05,013 --> 00:46:07,583
I'm getting frustrated over here.

608
00:46:08,853 --> 00:46:15,023
If I speak up, will you two do as I say?

609
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:24,273
There can be no issues with the repayment schedule.

610
00:46:24,273 --> 00:46:26,943
No delay, suspension, or legal restrictions.

611
00:46:26,943 --> 00:46:30,212
Because then, CEO Jin Yang Cheol will get involved

612
00:46:30,212 --> 00:46:33,482
and won't stop at anything to feed Miracle to Soonyang Investment.

613
00:46:33,482 --> 00:46:34,612
So what?

614
00:46:34,612 --> 00:46:37,082
The overseas shares Miracle invested in.

615
00:46:37,082 --> 00:46:39,823
Liquidate them all.

616
00:46:40,683 --> 00:46:45,122
Rachel. How much will that be worth at today's exchange rate?

617
00:46:45,122 --> 00:46:47,822
Do you want to bring that money in now?

618
00:46:47,822 --> 00:46:52,393
When prosecutors are watching this black-haired foreigner so closely?

619
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:55,203
Wake up. We'll never see a cent of it if you do that.

620
00:46:55,203 --> 00:46:57,402
They'll take it all, saying it's tax.

621
00:46:57,402 --> 00:46:59,203
Wouldn't that be a waste?

622
00:46:59,203 --> 00:47:04,142
Those overseas shares ensured us a stable profit over the past five years.

623
00:47:05,343 --> 00:47:07,013
CEO Oh.

624
00:47:07,013 --> 00:47:11,113
Do you remember what I said to you five years ago in NY?

625
00:47:11,113 --> 00:47:19,783
I asked you to turn my hunch into data and profits.

626
00:47:19,783 --> 00:47:23,163
This is the only option I can think of.

627
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:29,062
Retrieve everything we invested overseas. Please.

628
00:47:36,313 --> 00:47:42,313
To uproot Do Jun completely, this is the perfect timing.

629
00:47:44,482 --> 00:47:46,482
According to numerology,

630
00:47:46,482 --> 00:47:49,423
Do Jun's time and date of birth clash with the current time.

631
00:47:49,423 --> 00:47:56,293
The negative energy, the misfortune index has doubled.

632
00:47:56,293 --> 00:47:57,563
What's the clash?

633
00:47:57,563 --> 00:47:59,802
Figuratively, "a tiger bites, and you bleed."

634
00:47:59,802 --> 00:48:03,062
In other words, you die an unnatural death.

635
00:48:03,062 --> 00:48:05,302
He'll die away from home.

636
00:48:05,302 --> 00:48:09,603
The only thing is if you factor in his date of birth,

637
00:48:09,603 --> 00:48:13,183
if he manages to overcome the tiger's deadly bite,

638
00:48:13,183 --> 00:48:16,912
he can attain riches and fame beyond that of anyone else's.

639
00:48:16,912 --> 00:48:20,053
So I must not miss out this time?

640
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:25,593
I must do whatever I can to make Miracle mine.

641
00:48:25,593 --> 00:48:28,222
Make the call.

642
00:48:28,222 --> 00:48:32,480
Tell that guy to bring me Do Jun's investment portfolio.

643
00:48:38,572 --> 00:48:40,802
- Chairman. 
 - Yes?

644
00:48:40,802 --> 00:48:44,872
Do you think the prosecutors could find Do Jun guilty?

645
00:48:44,872 --> 00:48:46,742
I'm a businessman.

646
00:48:46,742 --> 00:48:48,643
If you lose money, you're guilty.

647
00:48:48,643 --> 00:48:51,913
If you make money, you're innocent. That's it.

648
00:48:52,822 --> 00:48:54,440
Mr. Lee.

649
00:48:54,440 --> 00:49:01,393
Do you know what's most important in the capital market?

650
00:49:01,393 --> 00:49:05,463
- Not sure. 
 - The IMF said...

651
00:49:05,463 --> 00:49:08,763
- it's the global standard. 
 - What?

652
00:49:08,763 --> 00:49:11,402
Work like a dog to spend like a mogul.

653
00:49:11,402 --> 00:49:15,242
That's the Korean standard.

654
00:49:15,242 --> 00:49:19,282
The global standard says we must earn like a mogul, too.

655
00:49:19,282 --> 00:49:21,783
Without getting dirty.

656
00:49:21,783 --> 00:49:24,112
While observing the law.

657
00:49:24,112 --> 00:49:26,182
And being moral.

658
00:49:27,522 --> 00:49:32,692
The capital market won't consider Do Jun a mogul.

659
00:49:33,462 --> 00:49:36,632
He's dirty all over.

660
00:49:38,833 --> 00:49:42,803
Is that why you agreed to let Vice Chairman Jin Dong Ki take over Miracle?

661
00:49:42,803 --> 00:49:45,733
Dong Ki is good with numbers.

662
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:48,042
He pushed aside Heavy Machinery and Chemicals

663
00:49:48,042 --> 00:49:50,943
to take over the investment and insurance business.

664
00:49:50,943 --> 00:49:54,213
If the picture he wants to paint is the same as mine,

665
00:49:54,213 --> 00:49:56,583
it wouldn't be a bad idea

666
00:49:58,683 --> 00:50:01,922
for Dong Ki to take my seat.

667
00:50:02,723 --> 00:50:04,993
The financial holding company.

668
00:50:04,993 --> 00:50:07,992
Will you give it to him?

669
00:50:22,642 --> 00:50:24,773
   

670
00:50:24,773 --> 00:50:28,240
   

671
00:50:33,652 --> 00:50:35,252
So...

672
00:50:35,252 --> 00:50:40,352
Miracle's incredible rate of earnings was due to overseas shares?

673
00:50:40,352 --> 00:50:41,923
Yes, Vice-Chairman.

674
00:50:41,923 --> 00:50:44,763
And these are what they invested in?

675
00:50:47,033 --> 00:50:48,802
Give it to him.

676
00:50:58,572 --> 00:51:02,082
- I'll leave now, Sir. 
 - Okay.

677
00:51:02,082 --> 00:51:05,982
- I expect a lot from you. 
 - Okay. Thank you.

678
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:14,930
   

679
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:20,503
 I know that 

680
00:51:23,273 --> 00:51:30,372
 a terrible tragedy that no one can even imagine is about to happen. 

681
00:51:39,952 --> 00:51:43,052
 What happened when I was a child in my other life. 

682
00:51:43,052 --> 00:51:46,663
 If it were me, I'd back Roh Tae Woo's campaign. 

683
00:51:46,663 --> 00:51:48,962
 Kim Young Sam and Kim Dae Jung of the Democratic Party 

684
00:51:48,962 --> 00:51:52,632
 decided against a single candidacy earlier today. 

685
00:51:52,632 --> 00:51:55,333
 An aircraft with 95 passengers and 20 flight attendants 

686
00:51:55,333 --> 00:51:57,603
 went missing above Yangon, Burma. 

687
00:51:57,603 --> 00:52:04,373
 It will also most definitely happen in my current life of Jin Do Jun. 

688
00:52:06,513 --> 00:52:12,483
 As if mocking my efforts and desires. 

689
00:52:13,723 --> 00:52:17,692
 It most definitely will happen. 

690
00:52:21,422 --> 00:52:28,993
 All I can do is make my own choices. 

691
00:52:37,042 --> 00:52:37,773
 This just in. 
   

692
00:52:37,773 --> 00:52:40,982
 You're looking at a clearly very disturbing live shot there. 

693
00:52:40,982 --> 00:52:46,410
 A plane has crashed into one of the towers of the World Trade Center this morning. 

694
00:52:53,993 --> 00:52:55,362
What effects do we expect?

695
00:52:55,362 --> 00:52:56,732
How much will we lose?

696
00:52:56,732 --> 00:52:59,462
Between 10 to 15 for KOSDAQ, 17 for KOSPI.

697
00:52:59,462 --> 00:53:01,032
Korea's stock market will open three hours later tomorrow.

698
00:53:01,032 --> 00:53:03,202
The US market will be closed for four days.

699
00:53:03,202 --> 00:53:06,633
As soon as it opens tomorrow, people will sell in panic across all industries.

700
00:53:06,633 --> 00:53:08,703
Call the fund managers and traders.

701
00:53:08,703 --> 00:53:10,842
Tell them to sell the prices-sensitive stocks first.

702
00:53:10,842 --> 00:53:12,812
Have them on standby three hours ahead!

703
00:53:12,812 --> 00:53:14,743
Yes, Sir.

704
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:25,723
Sir. There's another more pressing issue.

705
00:53:25,723 --> 00:53:29,923
The shares you bought in New York that were in Miracle's portfolio.

706
00:53:29,923 --> 00:53:32,862
Airlines, hotels, travel agencies, and insurance companies.

707
00:53:32,862 --> 00:53:36,833
They're businesses that'll suffer the most after this incident.

708
00:53:36,833 --> 00:53:38,932
A loss is inevitable.

709
00:53:38,932 --> 00:53:41,302
You punk!

710
00:53:44,442 --> 00:53:47,143
This is all on you.

711
00:53:47,143 --> 00:53:49,752
You said Do Jun is lucky with money!

712
00:53:49,752 --> 00:53:51,752
I apologize, Sir.

713
00:53:56,023 --> 00:53:59,152
Scrape together all the money we have.

714
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:04,262
As soon as the market opens tomorrow, buy put options.

715
00:54:04,262 --> 00:54:05,163
Put options?

716
00:54:05,163 --> 00:54:08,932
They're designed to protect you against a loss!

717
00:54:08,932 --> 00:54:15,672
Even if the stock market crashes, I will survive and get out somehow.

718
00:54:21,313 --> 00:54:23,282
No, right?

719
00:54:26,252 --> 00:54:29,883
Fellow Korean Lad, don't tell me you knew this would happen.

720
00:54:31,322 --> 00:54:32,563
No. How could you have known?

721
00:54:32,563 --> 00:54:35,893
Not even the FBI or CIA knew.

722
00:54:35,893 --> 00:54:41,633
It was the only option we could have chosen.

723
00:54:41,633 --> 00:54:44,373
It was a terrorist attack in the center of New York.

724
00:54:44,373 --> 00:54:48,502
No one can say when Wall Street will recover from the shock.

725
00:54:48,502 --> 00:54:50,013
If we hadn't sold our shares

726
00:54:50,013 --> 00:54:52,743
in the overseas markets, as you told us to...

727
00:54:52,743 --> 00:54:54,382
CEO Oh.

728
00:54:54,382 --> 00:54:59,952
To all the victims of this attack, send a donation.

729
00:54:59,952 --> 00:55:02,183
in Miracle's name.

730
00:55:06,993 --> 00:55:10,963
Why don't we buy some put options?

731
00:55:10,963 --> 00:55:13,063
The market will crash for the next few days.

732
00:55:13,063 --> 00:55:16,672
We made a lot from selling all we had in the New York market.

733
00:55:16,672 --> 00:55:22,473
People will try to sell whatever they own when the market opens tomorrow.

734
00:55:23,172 --> 00:55:26,013
I'll buy up some blue-chip stocks.

735
00:55:26,013 --> 00:55:28,642
You'll go against the tide?

736
00:55:29,313 --> 00:55:35,752
If you buy put options that bet the market will crash, we could make some money.

737
00:55:35,752 --> 00:55:38,452
Because that's going with the flow.

738
00:55:38,452 --> 00:55:44,793
But what I want is to change the flow.

739
00:55:47,002 --> 00:55:48,963
Let me leave now.

740
00:55:51,972 --> 00:55:55,303
 Buy Miracle Fund for sale 

741
00:55:55,303 --> 00:55:56,212
   

742
00:55:56,212 --> 00:55:58,112
 A country that will rise again. 

743
00:55:58,112 --> 00:56:00,482
 Invest in a miracle. 

744
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:05,413
 By our hands, with our efforts, let's buy miracles. 

745
00:56:05,413 --> 00:56:06,982
 Buy Miracle. 

746
00:56:06,982 --> 00:56:09,123
 We believe in the Korean economy. 

747
00:56:09,123 --> 00:56:11,922
 Miracle Investment. 

748
00:56:11,922 --> 00:56:17,592
Do Jun's using aggressive strategies to make funds more accessible and popular.

749
00:56:18,293 --> 00:56:24,333
It's just that the domestic stock market hasn't yet recovered from the 9-11 attacks.

750
00:56:24,333 --> 00:56:27,332
   

751
00:56:27,332 --> 00:56:30,342
What's today's KOSPI index?

752
00:56:30,342 --> 00:56:36,582
The KOSPI index is 472 points, the lowest it has ever been, but that's okay.

753
00:56:36,582 --> 00:56:39,522
After just one week, the Buy Miracle Fund...

754
00:56:39,522 --> 00:56:41,083
   

755
00:56:41,083 --> 00:56:43,553
exceeded one trillion won  ($1B). 

756
00:56:44,993 --> 00:56:48,962
Fellow Korean Lad, ever heard of "Retire45" or "56Thief?"

757
00:56:48,962 --> 00:56:50,992
The retirement age is 45.

758
00:56:50,992 --> 00:56:53,833
If you stay on until you're 56, you're a thief.

759
00:56:53,833 --> 00:56:55,932
What about "38 Line?"

760
00:56:55,932 --> 00:57:00,773
Soon there will be a saying, "If you turn 38, you're nearing the end of your working life."

761
00:57:00,773 --> 00:57:01,942
That's the 38 Line.

762
00:57:01,942 --> 00:57:05,013
Right. They're all people who can't rely on the interest rate.

763
00:57:05,013 --> 00:57:06,883
Our clients.

764
00:57:06,883 --> 00:57:12,513
Buy Miracle Fund will end the age of saving accounts and open the age of investments.

765
00:57:13,452 --> 00:57:15,522
   

766
00:57:22,193 --> 00:57:27,332
In just two weeks after Buy Miracle Fund was released, we have reached four trillion won  ($4B) .

767
00:57:27,332 --> 00:57:28,302
Yes!

768
00:57:28,302 --> 00:57:32,933
Other funds that our competitors launched are doing well also.

769
00:57:32,933 --> 00:57:36,272
Altogether, the money we flooded the market with is 90 trillion won  ($90B) .

770
00:57:36,272 --> 00:57:37,143
   

771
00:57:37,143 --> 00:57:41,183
The KOSPI index has risen for a month and broke the 540 mark.

772
00:57:41,183 --> 00:57:45,213
We're completely over the 9-11 attacks.

773
00:57:45,213 --> 00:57:46,953
Fellow Korean Lad,

774
00:57:46,953 --> 00:57:50,523
you did change the flow.

775
00:57:54,993 --> 00:57:58,093
   

776
00:57:58,993 --> 00:58:02,363
Isn't this all wrong?

777
00:58:02,363 --> 00:58:03,502
   

778
00:58:03,502 --> 00:58:08,773
How can the KOSPI index be on the rise already?

779
00:58:09,513 --> 00:58:11,373
Answer me!

780
00:58:13,213 --> 00:58:16,342
Over 3,000 died in a terrorist attack in the center of New York.

781
00:58:16,342 --> 00:58:19,853
So how, why, how on earth...

782
00:58:19,853 --> 00:58:23,593
How could things recover after just one month?

783
00:58:23,593 --> 00:58:26,592
Where are all the people who said there'd be a war?

784
00:58:26,592 --> 00:58:29,193
Why is everything so peaceful?

785
00:58:29,193 --> 00:58:32,233
   

786
00:58:32,233 --> 00:58:35,962
The US lowered the interest rate, improving liquidity.

787
00:58:37,002 --> 00:58:40,072
Future stocks sold at a record high,

788
00:58:40,072 --> 00:58:42,543
so the ten billion won  ($10M)  you invested in put options,

789
00:58:42,543 --> 00:58:46,712
in case the market crashed, was lost.

790
00:58:48,382 --> 00:58:52,212
No one could have foreseen this kind of bull market.

791
00:58:52,212 --> 00:58:54,083
Miracle Investment's Buy Miracle fund.

792
00:58:54,083 --> 00:58:59,953
Who could've thought they'd create such a dramatic turnaround in the Korean market?

793
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:02,492
Why you...

794
00:59:06,032 --> 00:59:09,332
Sir, you have a visitor.

795
00:59:20,313 --> 00:59:22,382
Hello, Mr. Baek.

796
00:59:23,113 --> 00:59:24,883
Thank you.

797
00:59:30,152 --> 00:59:32,423
Hello, Uncle.

798
00:59:37,263 --> 00:59:39,333
"Buy Miracle?"

799
00:59:39,333 --> 00:59:42,632
You scraped together what little you had to launch a successful fund,

800
00:59:42,632 --> 00:59:47,332
and you're acting like a victorious hero.

801
00:59:47,332 --> 00:59:50,713
Do you think I don't know? You also...

802
00:59:50,713 --> 00:59:53,183
You lost just as much as I did.

803
00:59:53,183 --> 00:59:55,082
The airlines, travel agencies, hotels, and insurance companies

804
00:59:55,082 --> 00:59:58,112
you'd invested in through the New York Stock Exchange.

805
00:59:58,112 --> 01:00:03,353
Do you think I don't know you lost all that in the 9-11 terrorist attacks?

806
01:00:03,353 --> 01:00:05,422
Oh, that?

807
01:00:06,222 --> 01:00:12,392
New York Air, the Lavender Hotel chain, Seventy Insurance, and Tour Eagles?

808
01:00:13,433 --> 01:00:15,402
How odd.

809
01:00:15,402 --> 01:00:18,602
Miracle's investment portfolio is top secret.

810
01:00:18,602 --> 01:00:22,942
How do you know all that?

811
01:00:28,842 --> 01:00:33,382
You can't let in a neighbor's dog just because they're cute.

812
01:00:35,683 --> 01:00:38,323
It will be your loss if it bites you.

813
01:00:40,993 --> 01:00:43,423
You punk!

814
01:00:54,402 --> 01:00:56,973
Why did you come here?

815
01:00:58,473 --> 01:01:01,442
Did you come here to lecture me?

816
01:01:01,442 --> 01:01:03,413
No.

817
01:01:04,152 --> 01:01:09,353
I'm here to buy Soonyang Investment.

818
01:01:10,353 --> 01:01:12,022
What?

819
01:01:24,132 --> 01:01:26,373
Regardless of the country's economy,

820
01:01:26,373 --> 01:01:28,902
regardless of whether your customers lose their savings,

821
01:01:28,902 --> 01:01:33,472
you're praying the market will crash when you're the head of an investment company.

822
01:01:33,472 --> 01:01:36,513
I can't let you stay in charge any longer.

823
01:01:40,382 --> 01:01:42,253
Do Jun.

824
01:01:44,723 --> 01:01:46,593
Do Jun!

825
01:01:50,132 --> 01:01:55,163
Do you think the world will go the way you want?

826
01:01:59,773 --> 01:02:01,642
Of course not.

827
01:02:02,473 --> 01:02:04,412
Oh, right.

828
01:02:05,143 --> 01:02:07,842
The National Pension, Teachers' Pension,

829
01:02:07,842 --> 01:02:14,153
and Pension and Funds Bureau decided to cut ties with Soonyang Investment.

830
01:02:15,582 --> 01:02:17,352
What?

831
01:02:17,352 --> 01:02:21,810
Oh, you didn't know?

832
01:02:30,373 --> 01:02:34,973
You lost over ten billion won  ($10M)  in a speculative put option investment,

833
01:02:34,973 --> 01:02:41,342
and they want to hold you responsible for the extreme and dogmatic decision.

834
01:02:41,982 --> 01:02:45,653
Uncle. The Pension and Funds Bureau.

835
01:02:45,653 --> 01:02:52,023
They're your largest client and second majority shareholder with a 12-percent stake.

836
01:02:52,023 --> 01:02:53,663
If they cut ties with you,

837
01:02:53,663 --> 01:02:58,963
does that mean selling their stake or canceling all transactions?

838
01:03:00,433 --> 01:03:04,803
No, wait. It could be both.

839
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:07,572
Too bad.

840
01:03:14,842 --> 01:03:19,953
If Miracle were to take over and we appoint...

841
01:03:22,252 --> 01:03:23,223
   

842
01:03:23,223 --> 01:03:28,793
an investment expert, the worst can be avoided.

843
01:03:32,032 --> 01:03:36,402
A nephew takes the responsibility for his uncle's shortcomings.

844
01:03:40,143 --> 01:03:42,273
I like that picture.

845
01:03:51,783 --> 01:03:53,512
Here you go.

846
01:03:55,223 --> 01:03:59,160
- Have some coffee. 
 - Thank you.

847
01:04:04,663 --> 01:04:09,062
Mr. Ha. I have a question.

848
01:04:10,833 --> 01:04:15,002
You could've returned to work for Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki.

849
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:18,272
Why did you choose me?

850
01:04:18,272 --> 01:04:22,612
I didn't make a choice.

851
01:04:23,252 --> 01:04:25,952
If I were to lose this job,

852
01:04:25,952 --> 01:04:30,323
it would only mean I'd messed up.

853
01:04:30,323 --> 01:04:35,022
Do you think anyone at Soonyang would take me back then?

854
01:04:37,893 --> 01:04:45,000
From the start, I was never allowed a choice.

855
01:04:45,933 --> 01:04:52,673
You were born into this family as 4-2, so you wouldn't get it.

856
01:04:52,673 --> 01:04:54,813
I'm 4-2?

857
01:04:57,652 --> 01:05:01,123
My gosh. I apologize.

858
01:05:03,453 --> 01:05:07,193
Chairman Jin's fourth son's second son.

859
01:05:07,193 --> 01:05:09,493
Is that it?

860
01:05:09,493 --> 01:05:11,032
Yes.

861
01:05:15,333 --> 01:05:20,732
That 4-2 asks you to do your best.

862
01:05:22,843 --> 01:05:24,343
Right.

863
01:05:25,942 --> 01:05:27,782
Thank you.

864
01:05:30,052 --> 01:05:31,983
Move.

865
01:05:33,652 --> 01:05:36,083
Where is Father?

866
01:05:36,083 --> 01:05:38,292
What a lovely sight.

867
01:05:38,292 --> 01:05:41,662
Mom. Where is Father?

868
01:05:41,662 --> 01:05:43,122
Father!

869
01:05:43,122 --> 01:05:44,232
Dong Ki!

870
01:05:44,232 --> 01:05:47,633
You, stay out of it.

871
01:05:47,633 --> 01:05:50,672
Father, where are you? Come on out!

872
01:05:50,672 --> 01:05:54,203
I have something to settle with the old man!

873
01:05:54,203 --> 01:05:56,673
Father, I have something to say!

874
01:05:56,673 --> 01:05:58,913
What's all this noise about?

875
01:06:04,483 --> 01:06:06,212
Father.

876
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:08,822
I know everything.

877
01:06:10,752 --> 01:06:13,693
I know that you're behind Do Jun.

878
01:06:13,693 --> 01:06:16,893
I know that now.

879
01:06:16,893 --> 01:06:21,832
Hwa Young and I, the fact that we lost everything

880
01:06:21,832 --> 01:06:24,232
to our nephew, who's just a kid.

881
01:06:24,232 --> 01:06:28,702
It makes no sense unless you're behind him!

882
01:06:28,702 --> 01:06:31,573
- That's enough! 
 - Soonyang!

883
01:06:32,772 --> 01:06:36,613
You wanted Do Jun to take over from the very beginning.

884
01:06:36,613 --> 01:06:39,883
Isn't that so? Right?

885
01:06:39,883 --> 01:06:42,152
Why... Why is it...

886
01:06:42,152 --> 01:06:44,652
Why is it always me...

887
01:06:44,652 --> 01:06:49,823
Why am I always pushed to the wayside? Why?

888
01:06:54,002 --> 01:06:58,802
How much longer must I struggle and grovel?

889
01:06:58,802 --> 01:07:02,502
What can I do, what am I to do to make you care about me?

890
01:07:02,502 --> 01:07:04,613
For how long...

891
01:07:05,943 --> 01:07:08,743
How much longer must I live like this for?

892
01:07:08,743 --> 01:07:12,982
My gosh... Father.

893
01:07:18,223 --> 01:07:20,592
Father...

894
01:07:20,592 --> 01:07:23,962
Is that all he's capable of?

895
01:07:28,132 --> 01:07:30,333
I had no idea.

896
01:07:34,002 --> 01:07:36,173
Father.

897
01:07:36,173 --> 01:07:38,473
Father.

898
01:07:47,052 --> 01:07:49,283
It's cold out.

899
01:07:49,283 --> 01:07:51,992
I'm burning with fury inside.

900
01:07:54,393 --> 01:07:58,433
You must sort things out for them before it's too late.

901
01:07:59,332 --> 01:08:01,702
Making sure the siblings stay close is another way to protect Soonyang.

902
01:08:01,702 --> 01:08:06,232
It's only natural that they resent Do Jun.

903
01:08:06,232 --> 01:08:10,603
Hang Jae, do you also think Do Jun is going too far?

904
01:08:21,453 --> 01:08:23,183
What are you doing here?

905
01:08:23,183 --> 01:08:25,892
The chairman wants to see you.

906
01:08:30,493 --> 01:08:34,432
What? You look like you saw a ghost.

907
01:08:34,432 --> 01:08:36,802
You didn't call ahead.

908
01:08:36,802 --> 01:08:38,903
Get in.

909
01:08:38,903 --> 01:08:42,572
There's somewhere we must go.

910
01:09:01,793 --> 01:09:05,263
Do you think this is allowed?

911
01:09:06,093 --> 01:09:11,363
Hwa Young and Dong Ki are your aunt and uncle.

912
01:09:11,972 --> 01:09:14,072
They're my kids.

913
01:09:14,802 --> 01:09:17,102
Your father's siblings.

914
01:09:19,272 --> 01:09:22,243
Must you go to the very end?

915
01:09:24,513 --> 01:09:26,483
If need be.

916
01:09:27,152 --> 01:09:29,152
What?

917
01:09:29,152 --> 01:09:32,022
I guess I'm like you.

918
01:09:32,022 --> 01:09:35,962
I have three extra things in here.

919
01:09:35,962 --> 01:09:40,393
They're full of greed, suspicion, and change of mind.

920
01:09:40,393 --> 01:09:42,403
That's three.

921
01:10:04,152 --> 01:10:05,592
What?

922
01:10:07,363 --> 01:10:09,263
Are you sure?

923
01:10:11,162 --> 01:10:16,193
Father is with that rascal Do Jun?

924
01:10:16,193 --> 01:10:18,603
- What? 
 - A press conference is scheduled.

925
01:10:18,603 --> 01:10:23,342
Reporters from TV stations and the major papers are waiting for the chairman to arrive.

926
01:10:25,772 --> 01:10:28,483
He's going to make it official.

927
01:10:29,413 --> 01:10:32,283
Without even a word to us.

928
01:10:32,283 --> 01:10:33,682
   

929
01:10:33,682 --> 01:10:35,623
- Where's the chairman? 
 - What's going on?

930
01:10:35,623 --> 01:10:38,723
- Can you tell us what it's about? 
 - What do you know?

931
01:10:38,723 --> 01:10:39,592
Any comments, Sir?

932
01:10:39,592 --> 01:10:42,063
Calm down, please, everyone.

933
01:10:42,063 --> 01:10:46,333
This press conference is about Soonyang Financial Holding Company's establishment.

934
01:10:46,333 --> 01:10:49,162
We'll begin as soon as the chairman arrives, which will be shortly.

935
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:50,903
Please bear with us.

936
01:10:50,903 --> 01:10:53,103
Is it true the holding company is to decide who his heir will be?

937
01:10:53,103 --> 01:10:54,272
Has he decided on someone?

938
01:10:54,272 --> 01:10:56,372
Will the new CEO become his successor?

939
01:10:56,372 --> 01:10:59,242
- Please tell us. 
 - Come on, now.

940
01:10:59,242 --> 01:11:03,513
Please ask those questions to the chairman himself.

941
01:11:04,252 --> 01:11:07,612
Do Jun, how about you run it?

942
01:11:09,053 --> 01:11:10,582
Pardon?

943
01:11:12,623 --> 01:11:15,193
Soonyang Financial Group.

944
01:11:16,962 --> 01:11:19,792
I'm going to give it to you.

945
01:11:47,863 --> 01:11:51,563
 Now I know the reason why 

946
01:11:52,863 --> 01:11:55,903
 I remember nothing about 4-2, Jin Do Jun. 

947
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:58,772
   

948
01:11:58,772 --> 01:12:00,173
   

949
01:12:00,173 --> 01:12:02,872
 It's because I died. 

950
01:12:05,842 --> 01:12:07,582
 And... 

951
01:12:12,253 --> 01:12:17,582
 things that are bound to happen always happen, without fail. 

952
01:12:20,992 --> 01:12:26,820
   

953
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:31,430
♫  I am falling into a deeper place  ♫

954
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:36,350
♫  I’m afraid I won’t be able  ♫

955
01:12:36,350 --> 01:12:40,630
♫  to return to my rightful place anymore  ♫

956
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:43,430
♫   In the end  ♫

957
01:12:45,370 --> 01:12:50,310
♫   I can't breathe, no, I can't breathe  ♫

958
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:52,940
♫   In the end  ♫

959
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:59,160
♫   let me live, please let me live  ♫

960
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:03,860
