1
00:00:04,317 --> 00:00:10,017
You found the answer, so you deserve the prize.

2
00:00:10,017 --> 00:00:12,888
I don't need money.

3
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:18,227
Once I am old enough to use that money, its monetary value will have dropped.

4
00:00:20,167 --> 00:00:21,767
Is that so?

5
00:00:21,767 --> 00:00:23,637
I'd like land.

6
00:00:23,637 --> 00:00:27,907
Like the grounds of Jeongsimjae, a place with lots of plants and trees.

7
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:36,348
I'd like this area, right here.

8
00:00:37,887 --> 00:00:41,857
That land was used to make pottery. It's useless.

9
00:00:41,857 --> 00:00:43,188
   

10
00:00:43,188 --> 00:00:45,738
Do you want the land in Bundang that badly?

11
00:00:49,128 --> 00:00:52,167
Let's see.

12
00:00:52,167 --> 00:00:53,697
How does 160,000m² sound?

13
00:00:53,697 --> 00:00:55,468
   

14
00:00:55,468 --> 00:01:00,937
 This small village will become a new city, home to 390,000 people. 

15
00:01:00,937 --> 00:01:05,347
 According to the government's New Town development plan, 

16
00:01:05,347 --> 00:01:08,218
 about 105,000 medium to large apartment blocks will be built on Seongnam's Bundang area, 

17
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:13,718
 this will reduce the burden on Gangnam's housing demand by housing 420,000 people. 

18
00:01:13,718 --> 00:01:17,787
What an incredible change this place went through.

19
00:01:18,528 --> 00:01:26,398
There was just one reservoir with fields and rice paddies reaching the horizons.

20
00:01:26,398 --> 00:01:28,498
People say that Bundang

21
00:01:28,498 --> 00:01:31,618
is the next best place to live, second to paradise.

22
00:01:34,707 --> 00:01:40,348
Did you know then that this place would become like this?

23
00:01:42,848 --> 00:01:45,448
Do you have a good eye?

24
00:01:46,158 --> 00:01:48,518
Or are you just lucky?

25
00:01:50,857 --> 00:01:55,158
I owe it to a grandfather who gifted me 160,000m² of land.

26
00:01:55,158 --> 00:01:58,927
Not just anyone gets to be born as your grandson.

27
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:02,237
Does that make me lucky?

28
00:02:02,237 --> 00:02:08,507
From the land here, do you know how much you made?

29
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:16,017
Welcome, Sir.

30
00:02:16,788 --> 00:02:18,647
This way, please.

31
00:02:23,827 --> 00:02:27,198
The 24 billion won  (24 million USD)  you asked for, Chairman.

32
00:02:27,198 --> 00:02:28,957
Good.

33
00:02:36,438 --> 00:02:40,377
The compensation for the purchase of the land was 14 billion won  (14 million USD) .

34
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:44,077
Ten billion  (10 million USD)  was from selling the nearby commercial land.

35
00:02:44,077 --> 00:02:50,007
A total of 24 billion won is what you earned.

36
00:02:53,387 --> 00:02:56,117
Would you like to count it out?

37
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:06,980


38
00:03:09,808 --> 00:03:14,638
How will you manage to spend all this?

39
00:03:14,638 --> 00:03:19,077
If you buy books with it, you'll never read them all in your lifetime.

40
00:03:19,077 --> 00:03:25,078
If you spend it on tuition, you'll have to get a hundred degrees.

41
00:03:25,078 --> 00:03:27,787
If you're afraid, leave it with me.

42
00:03:27,787 --> 00:03:31,207
I'll pay you more in interest than a bank does.

43
00:03:35,998 --> 00:03:41,638
   

44
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:48,408
Do Jun is still a kid, isn't he?

45
00:03:48,408 --> 00:03:50,548
It's only natural.

46
00:03:50,548 --> 00:03:54,077
Where could he have seen such a huge amount?

47
00:03:54,077 --> 00:03:58,748
Sir, Hangang Bank's Namdaemun Branch called.

48
00:03:58,748 --> 00:04:03,218
Do Jun has exchanged the money in the account into dollars.

49
00:04:06,028 --> 00:04:09,727
Shouldn't you ask him what it's for?

50
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:18,067
He may be clever, but it's too much money for a 20-year-old.

51
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:22,708
Does money choose people depending on their age?

52
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:28,017
Let's find out if Do Jun

53
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:33,048
has a good eye or good luck.

54
00:04:33,048 --> 00:04:35,917
It's just luck.

55
00:04:35,917 --> 00:04:38,788
How else can you explain it?

56
00:04:38,788 --> 00:04:44,158
What could such a little boy know about real estate that he'd ask for land in Bundang?

57
00:04:45,068 --> 00:04:48,868
No one can beat someone with great luck.

58
00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:51,818
Doesn't that make him even scarier?

59
00:04:51,818 --> 00:04:54,478
What does Father say almost every day?

60
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:57,207
You don't become rich by working hard.

61
00:04:57,207 --> 00:04:59,548
It's up to the heavens.

62
00:04:59,548 --> 00:05:05,017
Do Jun made 24 billion won  (24 million USD)  just by pointing at a map.

63
00:05:05,017 --> 00:05:09,317
Father could think his youngest grandson is blessed with good fortune.

64
00:05:09,317 --> 00:05:11,058
Wait.

65
00:05:13,398 --> 00:05:15,370
Is that why?

66
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,220
Isn't it weird?

67
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,897
Dad gave that massive sum to a kid who just started college and let him manage it himself.

68
00:05:21,897 --> 00:05:24,868
He's not that kind of person.

69
00:05:24,868 --> 00:05:27,108
He never let us do anything like that.

70
00:05:27,108 --> 00:05:32,107
Not even Seong Jun, his eldest grandson.

71
00:05:34,278 --> 00:05:35,978
Right?

72
00:05:40,888 --> 00:05:43,987
Seong Jun is the eldest heir,

73
00:05:43,987 --> 00:05:46,328
and he was exiled in the name of study.

74
00:05:46,328 --> 00:05:49,497
Why does Father play favorites with the youngest, Do Jun?

75
00:05:49,497 --> 00:05:51,698
That money.

76
00:05:52,668 --> 00:05:55,568
It's the price of our father's life.

77
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,367
If not for Do Jun,

78
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:02,977
when the plane exploded in midair,

79
00:06:03,608 --> 00:06:06,248
Father would've died in it.

80
00:06:07,817 --> 00:06:11,917
Who cares if it's 24 million or 240 million?

81
00:06:11,917 --> 00:06:14,537
What's with all the fuss so early in the morning?

82
00:06:19,528 --> 00:06:21,158
Don't you feel ashamed?

83
00:06:21,158 --> 00:06:25,527
You're jealous over a 20-year-old boy's allowance.

84
00:06:27,198 --> 00:06:30,467
You're grown-up adults.

85
00:06:30,467 --> 00:06:33,208
Do you really think so?

86
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:36,607
That it's allowance?

87
00:06:36,607 --> 00:06:39,208
That it's a simple gift?

88
00:06:43,618 --> 00:06:46,388
It could be a test.

89
00:06:46,388 --> 00:06:51,487
Father could be testing the boy with plans on picking a successor.

Take me with you, Father.

96
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,827
To the Film Market?

97
00:07:29,827 --> 00:07:34,268
I got into university, but I have a lot of time until the semester starts.

98
00:07:34,268 --> 00:07:35,868
I'd like to travel

99
00:07:35,868 --> 00:07:40,438
and maybe give some advice on what films you should invest in.

100
00:07:40,438 --> 00:07:42,978
Will you be an investment advisor?

101
00:07:42,978 --> 00:07:45,447
You know I have a good eye.

102
00:07:45,447 --> 00:07:49,977
I think I'm the one who got you this office.

103
00:07:49,977 --> 00:07:55,057
I must release this movie on Christmas at all costs?

104
00:07:57,388 --> 00:07:58,987
Do Jun.

105
00:07:58,987 --> 00:08:02,327
You're still young and don't know about movies.

106
00:08:02,327 --> 00:08:06,097
Christmas movies are for families.

107
00:08:06,097 --> 00:08:08,798
Who'd want to watch a gloomy movie about a kid

108
00:08:08,798 --> 00:08:12,467
left alone at home while his family goes traveling?

109
00:08:13,278 --> 00:08:15,507
And you still

110
00:08:15,507 --> 00:08:18,378
want me to import this movie?

111
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:28,318
So you want to go to the New York Film Market?

112
00:08:28,318 --> 00:08:32,128
Yes. Who knows?

113
00:08:32,128 --> 00:08:34,987
This time, it might not be just an office.

114
00:08:34,987 --> 00:08:37,398

- You go ahead, Hyung. 
 - Come with me.

121
00:08:54,578 --> 00:08:56,900
I'm not Seo Taiji.

122
00:08:59,048 --> 00:09:01,057
- Hey, Do Jun. 
 - What?

123
00:09:01,057 --> 00:09:04,388
Just because you got into law at the top of your class, don't go getting lofty, boring ideas

124
00:09:04,388 --> 00:09:07,797
of passing the bar while you're still in college.

125
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,158
What?

126
00:09:09,158 --> 00:09:11,067
Play. Have fun.

127
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:14,697
Go on group blind dates, regular blind dates, casual dates,

128
00:09:14,697 --> 00:09:16,467
- and go out with someone. 
 - Hang on.

129
00:09:16,467 --> 00:09:18,867
Are they all different?

130
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:23,208
Are they the same then? They have different names.

131
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,177
Don't do that.

132
00:09:25,177 --> 00:09:28,418
Don't make the face of a man who's already lived a lifetime.

133
00:09:28,418 --> 00:09:29,987
- What? 
 - Don't do that either.

134
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:31,487
- I'll do it. 
 - Go away.

135
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:34,117
Wait, what's that?

136
00:09:34,117 --> 00:09:37,328
- No way. 
 - What do we do now?

137
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:38,627
What is it?

138
00:09:38,627 --> 00:09:39,698
Excuse me.

139
00:09:39,698 --> 00:09:41,997
 - They'd caused a fuss...  
 - Excuse me.

140
00:09:41,997 --> 00:09:44,428
- Coming through. 
 - Sorry.

141
00:09:44,428 --> 00:09:47,298
 - They announced their retirement.  
 - What is it?

142
00:09:47,298 --> 00:09:50,937
 As of today, January 31, 1996... 

143
00:09:50,937 --> 00:09:53,738
Are they disbanding or retiring?

144
00:09:53,738 --> 00:09:56,337
They're retiring.

145
00:10:02,847 --> 00:10:04,888
- Oh, no... 
 - Jeez.

146
00:10:04,888 --> 00:10:07,688
   

147
00:10:07,688 --> 00:10:09,758
Why are they retiring?

148
00:10:09,758 --> 00:10:11,887
My loves.

149
00:10:11,887 --> 00:10:16,197
They're retiring because the pain of creating music is too much.

150
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:19,697
   

151
00:10:47,658 --> 00:10:49,227
What's this?

152
00:10:49,227 --> 00:10:52,597
This is a look I've never seen on your face.

153
00:10:52,597 --> 00:10:56,538
I can't believe that's what she looked like when she was twenty.

154
00:10:56,538 --> 00:10:58,638
Do you know her?

155
00:10:58,638 --> 00:11:00,937
Did you meet her? When?

156
00:11:00,937 --> 00:11:02,478
What?

157
00:11:06,518 --> 00:11:08,578
In twenty years' time.

158
00:11:11,717 --> 00:11:14,647
"In twenty years' time." He's at it again.

159
00:11:14,647 --> 00:11:16,317
Move, Ajusshi.

160
00:11:16,317 --> 00:11:17,688
- Move. 
 - Okay.

161
00:11:17,688 --> 00:11:20,388
- I can't see. 
 - I'm not an ajusshi.

162
00:11:24,628 --> 00:11:28,197
Chang Je, are you getting old?

163
00:11:28,197 --> 00:11:31,337
You shouldn't be up this early. What's going on?

164
00:11:31,337 --> 00:11:33,407
Why are you coming to see me?

165
00:11:34,538 --> 00:11:37,578
Take a look at this, Father.

166
00:11:37,578 --> 00:11:39,898
   

167
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:46,957
   

168
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:50,528
I don't think Hando Steel will last a month.

169
00:11:50,528 --> 00:11:52,728
It's a great chance to buy it up cheaply.

170
00:11:52,728 --> 00:11:55,597
They took out too many loans to try to expand.

171
00:11:55,597 --> 00:11:57,898
If you take over Hando Steel now,

172
00:11:57,898 --> 00:12:00,898
wouldn't it help our subsidiaries that use steel

173
00:12:00,898 --> 00:12:04,837
such as Soonyang Heavy Machinery, Motors, and Machinery?

174
00:12:04,837 --> 00:12:10,278
How will they handle this much debt?

175
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:12,547
If the government vouches for us,

176
00:12:12,547 --> 00:12:16,247
we can extend the repayment deadline to suit us.

177
00:12:18,087 --> 00:12:19,917
Can we trust YS?

178
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:24,258
If Hando Group were to break up now, it would cause huge turmoil.

179
00:12:24,258 --> 00:12:27,658
The president would want to prevent the worst-case scenario.

180
00:12:29,557 --> 00:12:34,398
Having a prosecutor son-in-law... is so reassuring.

181
00:12:34,398 --> 00:12:39,137
I thought I should give you... one last gift while I still work there.

182
00:12:39,137 --> 00:12:40,707
What?

183
00:12:40,707 --> 00:12:43,708
Are you going to start a law firm?

184
00:12:44,577 --> 00:12:49,278
Before the general election in April, YS will recruit talent to join his party.

185
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:53,358
I'd love to join as a legal advisor and run for office.

186
00:12:53,358 --> 00:12:55,058
The National Assembly is on an island.

187
00:12:55,058 --> 00:12:59,628
It'll be very windy out there. Do you want to get into politics?

188
00:12:59,628 --> 00:13:01,797
You can give me a sail.

189
00:13:01,797 --> 00:13:05,398
I want to venture into bigger waters for Soonyang.

190
00:13:10,238 --> 00:13:17,207
I'll see... if my son-in-law's ship can survive the sea.

191
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,747
I'll do my best not to let you down, Father.

192
00:13:47,337 --> 00:13:50,278
Something that dreamy would never happen.

193
00:13:50,978 --> 00:13:55,118
One day, will a Korean movie ever beat Hollywood movies

194
00:13:55,118 --> 00:13:58,347
to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards?

195
00:13:58,347 --> 00:14:03,288
That's like something out of a sci-fi cartoon, even thinking about it makes my heart swell.

196
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,528
It won't be easy.

197
00:14:05,528 --> 00:14:09,897
The Academy Awards tend to snub non-English movies.

198
00:14:09,897 --> 00:14:12,827
I'm too imaginative.

199
00:14:12,827 --> 00:14:18,068
If that day comes, a Korean song might even reach Billboard's Top 100.

200
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:20,737
I know.

201
00:14:20,737 --> 00:14:25,677
What I'm saying is as likely as Team Korea reaching the semifinals of the FIFA World Cup.

202
00:14:25,677 --> 00:14:27,347
Can't a man dream?

203
00:14:27,347 --> 00:14:29,447
Don't you know dreams come true?

204
00:14:29,447 --> 00:14:32,987
Darn you. Wait up, Dad.

205
00:14:35,988 --> 00:14:40,088
Yes. Dreams do come true.

206
00:14:45,498 --> 00:14:47,597
- Oh. 
 - I'm sorry.

207
00:14:47,597 --> 00:14:51,507
What the... This is just not fair.

208
00:14:54,408 --> 00:14:57,378
Are you Korean?

209
00:15:00,177 --> 00:15:01,917
Shoot.

210
00:15:06,417 --> 00:15:08,418
If you mean nationality, no.

211
00:15:08,418 --> 00:15:10,888
If you mean where I was born, yes.

212
00:15:10,888 --> 00:15:12,928
We're halfway around the world.

213
00:15:12,928 --> 00:15:16,128
You're not expecting a friendly hug, are you?

214
00:15:16,128 --> 00:15:17,497
Look.

215
00:15:17,497 --> 00:15:21,337
Because of you, I just became the investor

216
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:25,268
with the most rotten luck in this whole market.

217
00:15:25,268 --> 00:15:27,907
Oh, then...

218
00:15:27,907 --> 00:15:29,638
I'm truly sorry.

219
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:32,478
I'll pay you for the donut.

220
00:15:32,478 --> 00:15:35,878
- How much do you want? 
 - Ten million dollars!

221
00:15:37,388 --> 00:15:39,088
Ten million dollars?

222
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:42,158
What are you talking about?

223
00:15:42,158 --> 00:15:44,528
Does one donut cost ten million dollars?

224
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:48,097
I always eat a donut before I decide what to invest in.

225
00:15:48,097 --> 00:15:51,328
I've never broken it once. It's a principle, routine, and jinx.

226
00:15:51,328 --> 00:15:56,038
Anyway, it's my most important, necessary, and sufficient condition for investing.

227
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,408
This donut is from a shop in Midtown that's 30 minutes from here.

228
00:15:59,408 --> 00:16:03,378
And I have just ten minutes to decide what to invest in.

229
00:16:03,378 --> 00:16:08,347
Without a donut, in this market where ten million dollars will change hands,

230
00:16:08,347 --> 00:16:10,878
because of clumsy you.

231
00:16:10,878 --> 00:16:13,047
You'll pay me back?

232
00:16:13,047 --> 00:16:17,157
This donut cost a dollar, but it's worth ten million to me.

233
00:16:17,157 --> 00:16:19,357
How much will you pay me?

234
00:16:22,827 --> 00:16:27,627
Never bet on things... that you aren't sure about.

235
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:30,138
Do you get that?

236
00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:34,478
That...

237
00:16:44,988 --> 00:16:46,958
Do Jun! We're over here.

238
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,087
Okay. I'm coming.

239
00:16:51,587 --> 00:16:53,457
What a weirdo.

240
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,738
   

241
00:17:01,738 --> 00:17:03,097
"Titanic."

242
00:17:03,097 --> 00:17:06,368
 The "Titanic" fever is going strong. 

243
00:17:06,368 --> 00:17:11,047
 Nominated for 14 Academy Awards, the most in Academy history, 

244
00:17:11,047 --> 00:17:13,348
 at the 70th Academy Awards... 

245
00:17:13,348 --> 00:17:16,818
- Should I invest in "Titanic"? 
 - Yes.

246
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:21,617
Not for import or distribution rights... but the production?

247
00:17:21,617 --> 00:17:23,317
Yes.

248
00:17:23,317 --> 00:17:27,428
That way, you get a part of the massive profit.

249
00:17:27,428 --> 00:17:28,627
It goes here.

250
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:30,057
There are three arches.

251
00:17:30,057 --> 00:17:31,168
- Shall we bet? 
 - Yes.

252
00:17:31,168 --> 00:17:35,098
Do Jun, the reason you wanted to come here

253
00:17:35,098 --> 00:17:38,998
was because you had this movie in mind from the beginning?

254
00:17:43,538 --> 00:17:46,078
Hey. Look, Father.

255
00:17:49,178 --> 00:17:52,088
Wow. Nice.

256
00:17:54,518 --> 00:17:57,958
Are you convinced it will be a hit?

257
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,887
Like "Home Alone" last time?

258
00:18:04,028 --> 00:18:07,068
You know I have a good hunch.

259
00:18:07,068 --> 00:18:09,437
Trust me again.

260
00:18:10,468 --> 00:18:12,068
A hunch?

261
00:18:14,907 --> 00:18:19,947
Father. I have a scientific and logical reason this movie will flop.

262
00:18:19,947 --> 00:18:21,947
It'll shock you.

263
00:18:23,748 --> 00:18:29,017
Blockbusters involving water... are bound to flop.

264
00:18:29,017 --> 00:18:30,788
Why?

265
00:18:32,688 --> 00:18:37,298
- Because the project sinks. 
  - What?

266
00:18:37,298 --> 00:18:40,537
"Cutthroat Island," "Waterworld,"

267
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:45,307
and serial hit-maker James Cameron's only flop "The Abyss."

268
00:18:45,307 --> 00:18:48,037
They're all about water, and they all tanked.

269
00:18:48,037 --> 00:18:50,748
This is a science.

270
00:18:50,748 --> 00:18:53,147
Boss, you need to think this over.

271
00:18:53,147 --> 00:18:54,647
You have to think this over.

272
00:18:54,647 --> 00:18:58,347
You would've never made this decision if you didn't drop that goddamn donut.

273
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:01,717
Ten million dollars into the "Titanic"?

274
00:19:01,717 --> 00:19:05,888
Why don't you take that ten million dollars and just throw it into the Atlantic Ocean?

275
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:08,127
Will you still invest in "Titanic?"

276
00:19:08,127 --> 00:19:11,868
Come on. You didn't even watch "Waterworld."

277
00:19:11,868 --> 00:19:13,097
I couldn't.

278
00:19:13,097 --> 00:19:16,168
DiCaprio?

279
00:19:16,168 --> 00:19:18,307
Who on earth will do the acting?

280
00:19:18,307 --> 00:19:21,077
And the woman who looks like his aunt.

281
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,938
Do Koreans even know who she is?

282
00:19:22,938 --> 00:19:25,178
Do you know her? I don't know her.

283
00:19:25,178 --> 00:19:27,978
- No Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise. 
 - They're Korean.

284
00:19:27,978 --> 00:19:30,218
A blockbuster with zero stars?

285
00:19:30,218 --> 00:19:33,417
Do you really think this will work, Boss?

286
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:34,757
"Titanic."

287
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:37,388
It's about a luxury cruise ship that's only for the rich

288
00:19:37,388 --> 00:19:40,327
sinking in a gruesome manner in the middle of nowhere.

289
00:19:40,327 --> 00:19:41,958
It's about the rich losing out.

290
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,968
People have no choice but to flock to the cinemas.

291
00:19:43,968 --> 00:19:46,718
Why? Because it'll never happen in reality.

292
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,637
Did you hear that?

293
00:19:48,637 --> 00:19:51,538
She looks like DiCaprio's aunt?

294
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:56,138
- She's the real reason I want to invest in this movie. 
   - What?

295
00:19:56,138 --> 00:20:00,607
In a recession like this, the public cares very little for cute, young starlets.

296
00:20:00,607 --> 00:20:04,847
They prefer mature actresses with an intellectual air to be their heroines.

297
00:20:04,847 --> 00:20:07,188
Kate Winslet has that face.

298
00:20:07,188 --> 00:20:09,817
They've already spent an enormous amount of money to make the movie.

299
00:20:09,817 --> 00:20:13,057
It won't be profitable unless it becomes an international hit.

300
00:20:13,057 --> 00:20:16,958
Following Europe, countries in East Asia are building multiplex theaters too.

301
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,428
The number of moviegoers will increase exponentially.

302
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:22,137
And naturally, the profitability will go up as well.

303
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:25,037
You know what a low-price high-volume policy means, right?

304
00:20:25,907 --> 00:20:27,708
Are you confident?

305
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,777
Can I guarantee that the movie will be a hit? Then my answer is no.

306
00:20:30,777 --> 00:20:37,417
However, if it's about recovering the investment and securing stable profitability... Yes.

307
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:41,788
- He's right. 
 - I'm very rational now, Rachael.

308
00:20:41,788 --> 00:20:45,928
I said I dropped the donut.

309
00:20:45,928 --> 00:20:48,027
I never said I didn't eat it.

310
00:20:48,027 --> 00:20:49,557
What?

311
00:20:53,968 --> 00:20:57,138
"Based on scientific evidence..."

312
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,867
is what I'd say in a situation like this.

313
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:02,038
- Hey! 
 - How's it going?

314
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:03,407
- I'm good. 
 - Yes.

315
00:21:03,407 --> 00:21:04,678
Are you going to invest in this?

316
00:21:04,678 --> 00:21:06,608
- That's what I'm thinking about. 
 - What about you?

317
00:21:06,608 --> 00:21:08,118
- I'm investing... 
 - Do you have anything in mind?

318
00:21:08,118 --> 00:21:10,347
- Power Shares? 
 - Yes, I have...

319
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:14,690
   

320
00:21:21,028 --> 00:21:23,327
Mason Oh.

321
00:21:23,327 --> 00:21:27,128
His Korean name is Oh Se Hyeon.

322
00:21:29,168 --> 00:21:31,237
 Power Shares. 

323
00:21:31,237 --> 00:21:34,607
 The director and head investor for the Asia-Pacific region at Power Shares. 

324
00:21:43,317 --> 00:21:45,018
Hi, good afternoon.

325
00:21:45,018 --> 00:21:46,288
Hi, may I help you?

326
00:21:46,288 --> 00:21:48,817
Yes. I'm Jin.

327
00:21:48,817 --> 00:21:51,558
I'm here to see Mason Oh.

328
00:21:52,627 --> 00:21:55,758
- I got twenty on Kasparov. 
 - Fifty on Kasparov.

329
00:21:55,758 --> 00:21:57,167
We're nuts for doing this.

330
00:21:57,167 --> 00:22:00,768
I want to put... If you guys let me get in on...

331
00:22:02,468 --> 00:22:04,607
I'm surprised to see you here. I thought

332
00:22:04,607 --> 00:22:07,757
you'd be in a business meeting somewhere around now.

333
00:22:11,907 --> 00:22:13,778
Thanks to you,

334
00:22:13,778 --> 00:22:17,887
I became the luckiest investor on Wall Street today.

335
00:22:17,887 --> 00:22:21,387
Here's your delicious cheese pizza.

336
00:22:21,387 --> 00:22:22,887
Enjoy your meal.

337
00:22:22,887 --> 00:22:24,657
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

338
00:22:37,367 --> 00:22:39,267
What's that guy doing?

339
00:22:39,267 --> 00:22:41,208
Is he crazy or something?

340
00:22:45,277 --> 00:22:48,278
Maybe you should order something else.

341
00:22:48,278 --> 00:22:51,688
Darn it. This is so good.

342
00:22:51,688 --> 00:22:55,418
This is the best cheese pizza I've ever had.

343
00:22:55,418 --> 00:22:58,627
I should've bought some shares in this cheese company back then.

344
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,757
It's too late now.

345
00:23:01,698 --> 00:23:03,968
Darn, it's so good.

346
00:23:03,968 --> 00:23:07,737
Hey, you. I wanted to say something earlier.

347
00:23:07,737 --> 00:23:11,408
I  am  working right now.

348
00:23:11,408 --> 00:23:15,207
Leave me alone, will you? Don't disturb me.

349
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:19,948
 Well, that's the right move, by the way. 

350
00:23:19,948 --> 00:23:22,248
- Oh. 
 - Yes, that is the right move.

351
00:23:22,248 --> 00:23:24,317
That was absolutely amazing.

352
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:28,118
The supercomputer Deep Blue

353
00:23:28,118 --> 00:23:32,458
versus Kasparov, the chess champion.

354
00:23:33,688 --> 00:23:36,297
What a strange world we live in.

355
00:23:36,297 --> 00:23:38,897
Even a computer has a name?

356
00:23:38,897 --> 00:23:40,697
Hyeon Woo, what was it called?

357
00:23:40,697 --> 00:23:44,168
You know, that computer. Blue... What was it?

358
00:23:44,168 --> 00:23:46,968
Dad! Dad!

359
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:48,908
What is it, son?

360
00:23:48,908 --> 00:23:50,407
- Wow. 
 - Why? Who won?

361
00:23:50,407 --> 00:23:53,347
My gosh. Unbelievable.

362
00:23:56,248 --> 00:23:58,648
Who do you think will win?

363
00:23:59,587 --> 00:24:02,517
The supercomputer Deep Blue?

364
00:24:02,517 --> 00:24:06,587
Or Garry Kasparov, the chess champion?

365
00:24:06,587 --> 00:24:08,597
Whom?

366
00:24:09,557 --> 00:24:12,628
Well... Everyone says it's the game of the century,

367
00:24:12,628 --> 00:24:14,297
between a human and a computer.

368
00:24:14,297 --> 00:24:16,997
But that's not what you're interested in, right?

369
00:24:18,867 --> 00:24:22,207
"What is the company value of IBM, the company that made Deep Blue?"

370
00:24:22,207 --> 00:24:25,207
"When and how much should I invest to maximize my profit?"

371
00:24:25,207 --> 00:24:29,447
That's why you're so engrossed in the match. Am I right?

372
00:24:31,188 --> 00:24:32,887
I'll tell you who will win.

373
00:24:32,887 --> 00:24:37,588
In turn, spare me your time.

374
00:24:37,588 --> 00:24:41,188
You can tell me who will win when the match is still going on?

375
00:24:44,467 --> 00:24:46,598
Deep Blue will win.

376
00:24:46,598 --> 00:24:50,137
Invest in IBM, before this round ends.

377
00:24:52,837 --> 00:24:54,608
Can I have a piece?

378
00:24:57,547 --> 00:25:02,418
Well, chances are... It's 50-50 anyway.

379
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:05,447
I guess you're relying on luck. Too bad.

380
00:25:05,447 --> 00:25:08,658
Deep Blue hasn't overcome the limitations of AI.

381
00:25:08,658 --> 00:25:12,057
Even the engineers and developers at IBM admitted it.

382
00:25:12,057 --> 00:25:16,597
But you think Deep Blue will beat Kasparov, the genius player?

383
00:25:17,228 --> 00:25:20,767
Deep Blue has less than a twenty percent chance to win.

384
00:25:20,767 --> 00:25:24,637
That's what all experts say. Hey, young man.

385
00:25:24,637 --> 00:25:29,477
Never bet on things that you aren't sure about.

386
00:25:29,477 --> 00:25:32,227
I never rely on luck when it comes to my investments.

387
00:25:45,787 --> 00:25:48,697
When the game ends,

388
00:25:48,697 --> 00:25:53,468
you'll want to meet me.

389
00:25:56,238 --> 00:25:58,507
I'm confident.

390
00:25:58,507 --> 00:26:01,337
I'm 100 percent sure that Deep Blue will win.

391
00:26:01,337 --> 00:26:03,477
Hey, go away.

392
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:16,287
Oh, my gosh!

393
00:26:16,287 --> 00:26:18,628
- No problem! 
 - Yes!

394
00:26:18,628 --> 00:26:21,698
- I can't believe it. 
 - Thank you, gentlemen. Sorry, man.

395
00:26:21,698 --> 00:26:24,158
What? Deep Blue won?

396
00:26:25,027 --> 00:26:28,577
Did a supercomputer beat a human for the first time in history?

397
00:26:55,098 --> 00:26:57,428
That was a fluke, right?

398
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,838
How did you guess it?

399
00:27:05,838 --> 00:27:08,508
None of the experts on Wall Street

400
00:27:08,508 --> 00:27:12,647
predicted that Deep Blue would win.

401
00:27:17,248 --> 00:27:20,198
- I trusted my instincts. 
 - What?

402
00:27:20,198 --> 00:27:23,588
Had Kasparov been a mere player,

403
00:27:23,588 --> 00:27:26,157
Deep Blue wouldn't have stood a chance against him.

404
00:27:26,157 --> 00:27:29,297
However, I bet Kasparov, the genius chess player

405
00:27:29,297 --> 00:27:32,197
who's held the world champion title for the past twenty years,

406
00:27:32,827 --> 00:27:35,338
wanted to make history.

407
00:27:35,968 --> 00:27:37,938
"Fought against AI and won,"

408
00:27:37,938 --> 00:27:40,908
"the last pride of humanity."

409
00:27:40,908 --> 00:27:43,278
He probably wanted a title like that.

410
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:47,047
And greed

411
00:27:47,047 --> 00:27:50,177
always clouds your judgment.

412
00:27:52,317 --> 00:27:54,118
Not bad.

413
00:27:57,887 --> 00:28:00,887
I'd like to invest in companies in the US.

414
00:28:01,797 --> 00:28:06,397
Relying on your instincts, do you know how risky that can be?

415
00:28:06,397 --> 00:28:08,598
I have you.

416
00:28:08,598 --> 00:28:12,968
Use numbers to help me prove that my instincts are on point.

417
00:28:12,968 --> 00:28:15,977
I'm a busy man, you see.

418
00:28:15,977 --> 00:28:18,208
Enjoy the rest of your trip.

419
00:28:19,307 --> 00:28:22,077
With accurate data, which is essential for investing.

420
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:27,517
And with cash.

421
00:28:27,517 --> 00:28:33,257
Do you know that the minimum amount we require is 30,000 dollars, Student?

422
00:28:33,257 --> 00:28:35,127
I have a lot of money, Mr. Oh.

423
00:28:35,127 --> 00:28:38,928
Save up as much as you can before you join the military.

424
00:28:38,928 --> 00:28:40,998
Enjoy your trip. Bye.

425
00:28:46,938 --> 00:28:49,307
   

426
00:28:54,978 --> 00:28:56,778
As for Hando Steel, we're estimating

427
00:28:56,778 --> 00:28:58,718
that it will cost us about 500 million dollars.

428
00:28:58,718 --> 00:29:03,088
So then we will be broke after this deal.

429
00:29:03,088 --> 00:29:05,028
Does Hando Steel have anything that would make some money?

430
00:29:05,028 --> 00:29:08,097
Hando Steel owns a warehouse in Busan.

431
00:29:08,097 --> 00:29:10,057
If we make sure the creditors can't touch it

432
00:29:10,057 --> 00:29:12,567
and build an apartment complex in that lot,

433
00:29:12,567 --> 00:29:15,767
we should be able to earn back the money fairly soon.

434
00:29:15,767 --> 00:29:19,108
Sir, we encountered an unexpected variable, though.

435
00:29:19,108 --> 00:29:22,837
Daeyoung Group is getting ready to bid on Hando Steel, too.

436
00:29:22,837 --> 00:29:25,877
The Secretary's Office informed me this morning.

437
00:29:25,877 --> 00:29:28,377
Then it means Daeyoung will bid on it for sure.

438
00:29:28,377 --> 00:29:31,588
Our Secretary's Office obtains intel before the NSP* does. 
    (*Agency for National Security Planning, the name for the NSI 1981-199) 

439
00:29:31,588 --> 00:29:35,548
Right, Daeyoung makes cars, heavy equipment, and even ships.

440
00:29:35,548 --> 00:29:38,428
No wonder they want to buy a steel-producing company.

441
00:29:38,428 --> 00:29:41,597
To beat Daeyoung,

442
00:29:41,597 --> 00:29:44,668
we'd need at least 400 million dollars. Don't you think?

443
00:29:44,668 --> 00:29:47,638
It's not even a lucrative deal.

444
00:29:47,638 --> 00:29:51,368
Then should we forget about Hando Steel altogether?

445
00:29:51,368 --> 00:29:54,567
I will not let Daeyoung acquire Hando Steel.

446
00:29:55,678 --> 00:29:58,948
And the maximum amount we'll spend on this is 300 million.

447
00:29:58,948 --> 00:30:01,717
We won't spend a penny more.

448
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:04,078
Then how...

449
00:30:06,488 --> 00:30:08,758
Why are you asking me?

450
00:30:10,618 --> 00:30:12,958
- Vice-Chairman. 
 - Yes, Sir.

451
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:16,728
Go make sure we can acquire Hando Steel.

452
00:30:16,728 --> 00:30:18,327
Pardon?

453
00:30:19,968 --> 00:30:22,097
Why? Are you not confident?

454
00:30:22,097 --> 00:30:24,947
Then step down. Why are you sitting here?

455
00:30:29,307 --> 00:30:31,037
What will you do?

456
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:37,478
My goodness. Thanks. This looks delicious.

457
00:30:37,478 --> 00:30:41,157
Do Jun, you're such a perfect grandson.

458
00:30:41,157 --> 00:30:42,918
You came all the way here

459
00:30:42,918 --> 00:30:46,728
to see your grandparents after your trip to the US.

460
00:30:46,728 --> 00:30:48,728
Just like your father, you're handsome,

461
00:30:48,728 --> 00:30:52,327
smart, and sweet.

462
00:30:52,327 --> 00:30:54,268
Right, Jeong Rae?

463
00:30:54,268 --> 00:30:57,567
I'd say he got his looks from his mother.

464
00:30:57,567 --> 00:31:01,168
As for his brain... I don't know.

465
00:31:02,807 --> 00:31:06,208
Use your smart brain to follow in your grandpa's footsteps

466
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:10,178
and let the company grow.

467
00:31:10,178 --> 00:31:11,817
Why not study management?

468
00:31:11,817 --> 00:31:16,217
Why would you suddenly want to go to law school?

469
00:31:16,217 --> 00:31:18,327
He takes after his father,

470
00:31:18,327 --> 00:31:23,028
so I guess he has no interest in running a business whatsoever.

471
00:31:23,028 --> 00:31:24,957
Right, Do Jun?

472
00:31:26,367 --> 00:31:28,198
If I study law,

473
00:31:28,198 --> 00:31:31,467
I can be more helpful to Grandpa and his business.

474
00:31:31,467 --> 00:31:32,708
Really?

475
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:37,730
My gosh. Is that why you decided to study law, Do Jun?

476
00:31:38,407 --> 00:31:41,678
Grandma, I'm still in my first year.

477
00:31:42,718 --> 00:31:46,887
At the moment, I just want to play and not think about anything.

478
00:31:46,887 --> 00:31:49,157
Yes! Just play.

479
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,527
That's what you should do when you're in your first year.

480
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:53,087
Meet some girls too, okay?

481
00:31:53,087 --> 00:31:54,327
The board meeting is over.

482
00:31:54,327 --> 00:31:56,127
I see. You can go upstairs now, Do Jun.

483
00:31:56,127 --> 00:31:57,597
Okay, Grandma.

484
00:31:57,597 --> 00:32:00,067
- Thank you. 
 - Just play!

485
00:32:01,938 --> 00:32:05,138
Goodness, that old man is awfully stubborn.

486
00:32:05,138 --> 00:32:07,807
Acquire Hando Steel, but don't spend money.

487
00:32:07,807 --> 00:32:11,978
What are we supposed to do then?

488
00:32:14,617 --> 00:32:16,378
Right, Hyung?

489
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:27,388
Do Jun, you're back!

490
00:32:29,258 --> 00:32:32,227
You little rascal.

491
00:32:32,227 --> 00:32:34,938
Did you see lots of cool things in the US?

492
00:32:34,938 --> 00:32:37,668
- Did you eat lots of good food? 
 - Yes, Grandpa.

493
00:32:37,668 --> 00:32:40,007
Thanks to you,

494
00:32:40,007 --> 00:32:41,407
I had a great trip.

495
00:32:41,407 --> 00:32:42,678
Good.

496
00:32:42,678 --> 00:32:46,528
What was your favorite out of all the dishes you tried there?

497
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:50,848
- Pardon me? 
 - What was your favorite dish?

498
00:32:57,887 --> 00:32:59,658
The donut.

499
00:33:06,627 --> 00:33:08,938
That brat.

500
00:33:10,097 --> 00:33:12,538
Does he think he's Lee Mi Ja* or Cho Yong Pil* 
    (*two of the most influential Korean musicians at the time) 

501
00:33:12,538 --> 00:33:15,377
who just returned from their concert tour in Southeast Asia?

502
00:33:17,847 --> 00:33:19,478
I'm talking about Do Jun.

503
00:33:19,478 --> 00:33:21,947
He was in New York for a few days with his dad.

504
00:33:21,947 --> 00:33:25,717
And he showed up to report to Father that he's back.

505
00:33:25,717 --> 00:33:28,358
Hey. He's just twenty, and he's a guy.

506
00:33:28,358 --> 00:33:31,188
Guys his age are rarely that attentive.

507
00:33:31,188 --> 00:33:34,058
I bet he has an ulterior motive.

508
00:33:34,058 --> 00:33:38,168
At twenty, he should know how to respect his elders.

509
00:33:38,168 --> 00:33:40,318
He's better than his dad.

510
00:33:41,798 --> 00:33:45,137
You're so understanding, Hyungnim.

511
00:33:45,137 --> 00:33:47,277
You're incredibly magnanimous.

512
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:50,937
But you see, did you know that Do Jun

513
00:33:50,937 --> 00:33:53,148
exchanged the 24 billion won to US dollars before his trip?

514
00:33:53,148 --> 00:33:56,048
The price of our father's life?

515
00:33:56,777 --> 00:33:59,927
It wouldn't have been possible without Father's permission.

516
00:34:02,218 --> 00:34:04,987
He's different from his dad.

517
00:34:04,987 --> 00:34:07,588
Yoon Ki never had any interest in the company.

518
00:34:07,588 --> 00:34:11,027
But that boy is different. Just look at his eyes.

519
00:34:11,027 --> 00:34:16,197
We have to stay focused, Hyungnim.

520
00:34:18,438 --> 00:34:22,268
 That it's an allowance? That it's a simple gift? 

521
00:34:23,677 --> 00:34:25,907
 It could be a test. 

522
00:34:25,907 --> 00:34:29,117
 Go make sure we can acquire Hando Steel. 

523
00:34:29,117 --> 00:34:34,148
 Father could be testing the boy with plans on picking a successor. 

524
00:34:34,148 --> 00:34:37,358
 Why? Are you not confident? 

525
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:40,628
 Then step down. Why are you sitting here? 

526
00:34:46,598 --> 00:34:47,898
   

527
00:34:47,898 --> 00:34:49,967
I told the Economic Research Institute

528
00:34:49,967 --> 00:34:53,368
to prepare a report to send to Hando Steel's creditors.

529
00:34:53,368 --> 00:34:56,438
If we emphasize the number of jobs that will be created

530
00:34:56,438 --> 00:34:59,277
when we acquire Hando Steel and the positive synergy,

531
00:34:59,277 --> 00:35:01,418
Cheongwadae will show interest too.

532
00:35:01,418 --> 00:35:05,818
Risk management is crucial as the administration is nearing its end.

533
00:35:07,418 --> 00:35:10,518
Please proceed accordingly, Mr. Lee.

534
00:35:12,327 --> 00:35:13,787
Yes, Sir.

535
00:35:20,168 --> 00:35:21,668
Hyungnim.

536
00:35:32,378 --> 00:35:34,147
My old man...

537
00:35:35,778 --> 00:35:38,917
What does he want from me?

538
00:35:38,947 --> 00:35:41,818
Acquiring Hando Steel?

539
00:35:41,818 --> 00:35:47,558
Or is he just not happy with anything I do?

540
00:35:48,298 --> 00:35:53,068
You know what he's thinking better than his own children do.

541
00:35:54,467 --> 00:35:56,767
The chairman...

542
00:35:56,767 --> 00:36:01,608
would like to pass Soonyang down to someone who is like him.

543
00:36:01,608 --> 00:36:03,077
And it might not be his eldest son?

544
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:08,047
Young Ki, he is giving you a chance first because you're his eldest son.

545
00:36:12,347 --> 00:36:16,087
Focus on acquiring Hando Steel.

546
00:36:16,087 --> 00:36:20,958
He wants to see the fighting spirit and persistence in you.

547
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:25,168
To him, running a company

548
00:36:25,168 --> 00:36:28,537
was like a never-ending war,

549
00:36:28,537 --> 00:36:31,387
where he had to kill first in order to survive.

550
00:36:36,938 --> 00:36:38,838
Sir.

551
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:41,177
As you had predicted, Vice-Chairman Jin

552
00:36:41,177 --> 00:36:44,318
asked me what you were really thinking.

553
00:36:47,648 --> 00:36:50,918
I told him that you were giving him a chance

554
00:36:50,918 --> 00:36:56,687
and that nothing would change if he did his best to acquire Hando Steel.

555
00:36:56,687 --> 00:36:58,827
I assured him.

556
00:37:01,637 --> 00:37:03,667
Hang Jae.

557
00:37:04,398 --> 00:37:07,668
It's such a shame.

558
00:37:07,668 --> 00:37:09,108
Pardon me?

559
00:37:09,108 --> 00:37:13,478
Why were you born to your parents?

560
00:37:15,048 --> 00:37:18,177
I wish you were my son.

561
00:37:22,617 --> 00:37:24,588
Sir, didn't you know?

562
00:37:24,588 --> 00:37:29,327
I think of you as my father.

563
00:37:33,068 --> 00:37:34,418
I'll leave you to it.

564
00:37:37,938 --> 00:37:40,468
You see, Do Jun...

565
00:37:43,077 --> 00:37:46,708
His school is rather far from where he lives.

566
00:37:48,248 --> 00:37:50,978
Send him a car.

567
00:37:50,978 --> 00:37:52,387
Yes, Sir.

568
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:06,498
Hello, I'm Ha In Seok from the Secretary's Office.

569
00:38:06,498 --> 00:38:08,967
- Hello. 
 - Chairman sent me.

570
00:38:08,967 --> 00:38:12,768
He said your school was rather far, so it must be hard for you to commute.

571
00:38:16,477 --> 00:38:19,177
I'll be your driver from now on.

572
00:38:35,127 --> 00:38:37,097
Please just drop me off in front of the gate.

573
00:38:37,097 --> 00:38:38,967
I'll walk from there.

574
00:38:38,967 --> 00:38:41,798
No, I'll drop you off in front of the lecture hall.

575
00:38:41,798 --> 00:38:45,897
Most people at school already know who I am.

576
00:38:45,897 --> 00:38:50,438
I don't want to show up with a driver and attract attention.

577
00:38:50,438 --> 00:38:53,208
It won't do Grandpa any good.

578
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:56,217
Right, I'll remember that.

579
00:38:59,447 --> 00:39:01,947
   

580
00:39:20,338 --> 00:39:23,907
I got it. I don't want to turn into a spoiled brat.

581
00:39:24,608 --> 00:39:26,108
Oh, right.

582
00:39:26,108 --> 00:39:28,617
You're done for the day.

583
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:32,387
You're free to decide how to spend the rest of your day.

584
00:39:32,387 --> 00:39:33,787
Bye.

585
00:39:37,987 --> 00:39:39,887
- Hello! 
 - Come and take one!

586
00:39:39,887 --> 00:39:44,298
- Take a look at this. 
 - Please join us!

587
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:45,768
- Come find us! 
 - Join us!

588
00:39:45,768 --> 00:39:47,967
- Hello, take one! 
 - Welcome!

589
00:39:47,967 --> 00:39:49,568
- Hello, welcome! 
 - Are you a freshman?

590
00:39:49,568 --> 00:39:50,838
- Would you be interested? 
 - Hi.

591
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:52,707
Come find us!

592
00:39:52,707 --> 00:39:55,307
You should join us.

593
00:40:05,788 --> 00:40:08,788
Jin Do Jun, at the School of Law. Right?

594
00:40:13,527 --> 00:40:15,197
I study law too. I'm Kim Tae Young.

595
00:40:15,197 --> 00:40:17,197
He's Gang Nam from the Department of Journalism.

596
00:40:17,197 --> 00:40:21,527
Come on, why is the introduction so bland? It's just us.

597
00:40:23,597 --> 00:40:25,568
Tae Young's family owns Mirae Industry.

598
00:40:25,568 --> 00:40:27,668
My family owns Bando Firm.

599
00:40:27,668 --> 00:40:29,938
Ji Min's grandfather has been the Prime Minister since...

600
00:40:29,938 --> 00:40:31,507
So?

601
00:40:33,777 --> 00:40:38,387
Seong Jun must not have told you about our club, Prestigious Club.

602
00:40:38,387 --> 00:40:41,248
 I did hear about it. Prestigious Club. 

603
00:40:41,248 --> 00:40:44,487
You used to call me casually, but now you treat me as your senior.

604
00:40:44,487 --> 00:40:47,527
 It was the center of Vice-Chairman Jin Seong Jun's connections. 

605
00:40:47,527 --> 00:40:49,997
 A secretive social gathering of the children of prestigious families. 

606
00:40:49,997 --> 00:40:53,497
You don't have to act so stiffly. It's nothing much.

607
00:40:53,497 --> 00:40:58,137
We're just inviting you to have a meal with those of your class.

608
00:40:58,137 --> 00:40:59,868
People are so strange.

609
00:40:59,868 --> 00:41:04,038
They feel a sense of disharmony because of people like us.

610
00:41:04,038 --> 00:41:06,707
So what? Is that our fault?

611
00:41:06,707 --> 00:41:08,648
It's their inferiority complex.

612
00:41:08,648 --> 00:41:09,818
Yes.

613
00:41:09,818 --> 00:41:12,618
What do you think, newbie?

614
00:41:12,618 --> 00:41:15,387
Enough with all the talking.

615
00:41:15,387 --> 00:41:17,018
Your number.

616
00:41:18,458 --> 00:41:22,027
Why? Do I need your grandfather's permission to get your number?

617
00:41:22,027 --> 00:41:24,427
I'll text you the location and time of your welcoming dinner.

618
00:41:24,427 --> 00:41:28,697
You know it's a must to bring a partner, right?

619
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:40,708
I must stick to the rule, right?

620
00:41:44,847 --> 00:41:46,917
Nice!

621
00:41:47,748 --> 00:41:50,688
   

622
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,450
♫   No matter how much you like me now   ♫

623
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:18,150
♫   That might just be for now, because, you know...   ♫

624
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:24,580
♫   Laughing off your words   ♫

625
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:31,020
♫   You wouldn't know my heart   ♫

626
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:37,390
♫   I like everything about you   ♫

627
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:44,700
♫   But for now fear comes first.   ♫

628
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:50,170
♫   Too many thoughts are blocking you from me   ♫

629
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:56,310
♫   But you smile when you see me   ♫

630
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,740
♫   I'm just grateful.   ♫

631
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:01,060
♫   Your heart is still pure   ♫

632
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:04,450
♫   It remains so pretty   ♫

633
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:09,910
♫   But why am I doing this, everything is so hard  ♫

634
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:13,690
♫   The world will definitely change   ♫

635
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:17,370
♫   Our thoughts will change too   ♫

636
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:22,140
♫   Think about it, it's just a difficult thing.   ♫

637
00:43:22,148 --> 00:43:24,318
We've met before, right?

638
00:43:29,217 --> 00:43:32,487
You look familiar. I definitely met you before.

639
00:43:32,487 --> 00:43:34,787
Where did we meet?

640
00:43:34,787 --> 00:43:37,758
You definitely have a classic taste.

641
00:43:38,827 --> 00:43:41,727
You could just invite me for a meal.

642
00:43:42,338 --> 00:43:45,438
Isn't this tactic way too classic?

643
00:43:47,407 --> 00:43:50,307
Hello, I'm not hitting on you.

644
00:43:50,307 --> 00:43:51,907
Invite you for a meal?

645
00:43:51,907 --> 00:43:54,477
- When did I... 
 - Here it is.

646
00:43:58,148 --> 00:43:59,960
This is what you're looking for, right?

647
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,360
   

648
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:17,538
Let's have a meal.

649
00:44:44,327 --> 00:44:45,768
   

650
00:44:45,768 --> 00:44:48,467
   

651
00:44:48,467 --> 00:44:50,468
There was a reason.

652
00:44:51,467 --> 00:44:57,138
Are you so confident and rude because of your grandfather?

653
00:44:57,138 --> 00:44:59,148
No way.

654
00:44:59,148 --> 00:45:04,007
What's so hard about having a meal with a peer in my department?

655
00:45:05,288 --> 00:45:09,418
Do I have to use my grandfather's power to eat with you?

656
00:45:12,188 --> 00:45:14,427
If you treat me to a nice meal,

657
00:45:14,427 --> 00:45:17,558
I was going to tell you... when Seo Tai Ji was making a comeback.

658
00:45:17,558 --> 00:45:20,028
I thought you might be curious.

659
00:45:20,028 --> 00:45:22,837
Is it fun to tease people?

660
00:45:27,907 --> 00:45:29,738
It's true, right?

661
00:45:30,538 --> 00:45:33,708
They say Soonyang's better than the CIA at getting information.

662
00:45:33,708 --> 00:45:36,448
That's how you heard it, right?

663
00:45:36,448 --> 00:45:40,488
I knew it. Is he really making a comeback?

664
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:42,317
When?

665
00:45:44,458 --> 00:45:48,128
You're going to eat with me, right?

666
00:46:08,007 --> 00:46:10,978
She's there. Please stop here.

667
00:46:10,978 --> 00:46:12,818
Okay.

668
00:46:42,148 --> 00:46:45,818
Do you usually always dress like this?

669
00:46:51,918 --> 00:46:55,057
You're a bit different from the Seo Min Yeong I know.

670
00:46:55,057 --> 00:46:58,157
This? You're wrong.

671
00:46:58,157 --> 00:47:00,327
You must be thinking

672
00:47:00,327 --> 00:47:03,267
that I dolled up to meet you, but...

673
00:47:03,267 --> 00:47:07,237
You look better now. They're nice clothes.

674
00:47:14,978 --> 00:47:17,418
Tell me now. Is it true?

675
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:19,117
Is he really making a comeback?

676
00:47:19,117 --> 00:47:20,918
Seo Tai Ji, I mean.

677
00:47:20,918 --> 00:47:23,088
When is he coming back?

678
00:47:25,257 --> 00:47:26,950
You...

679
00:47:27,557 --> 00:47:30,198
Do you really know?

680
00:47:31,157 --> 00:47:34,198
In four years. The summer of 2000.

681
00:47:34,198 --> 00:47:37,367
He's coming back to celebrate the millennium, right?

682
00:47:37,367 --> 00:47:39,108
Not as a group.

683
00:47:39,108 --> 00:47:42,407
Seo Tai Ji continues as a soloist.

684
00:47:51,418 --> 00:47:53,148
What's wrong?

685
00:47:53,847 --> 00:47:56,088
Are you disappointed?

686
00:47:56,088 --> 00:48:00,488
That's... just like Seo Tai Ji.

687
00:48:01,157 --> 00:48:03,757
You need new music for the new millennium.

688
00:48:06,197 --> 00:48:09,967
I kept my word. Can we go eat now?

689
00:48:09,967 --> 00:48:12,137
- Sure. 
 - Okay. Let's go.

690
00:48:13,268 --> 00:48:16,077
- Seriously... 
 - Go.

691
00:48:16,077 --> 00:48:18,137
- Hurry up. 
 - Nice.

692
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:26,318
This is the last time, okay?

693
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:28,748
One more time.

694
00:48:33,387 --> 00:48:36,057
Order.

695
00:48:36,057 --> 00:48:37,697
Okay.

696
00:48:45,068 --> 00:48:48,108
You're here, Jin Do Jun.

697
00:48:50,577 --> 00:48:54,608
It's really nice to see you in Prestigious Club.

698
00:48:56,148 --> 00:48:57,548
It's so nice to see you.

699
00:48:57,548 --> 00:48:59,117
We made a bet.

700
00:48:59,117 --> 00:49:02,687
Oppa Seong Jun said... you were a boring bookworm,

701
00:49:02,687 --> 00:49:06,727
so you would never join our club. 
 - Prestigious Club?

702
00:49:06,727 --> 00:49:11,258
She's Seo Min Yeong, also a freshman at the Law Department.

703
00:49:11,258 --> 00:49:12,898
Hold on.

704
00:49:19,208 --> 00:49:20,967
You're obedient.

705
00:49:20,967 --> 00:49:23,608
You only did this.

706
00:49:28,108 --> 00:49:29,378
She's a guest difficult to invite.

707
00:49:29,378 --> 00:49:31,177
Seo Min Yeong from Hanil Girls' High School.

708
00:49:31,177 --> 00:49:34,248
Her father is working in Seoul District Public Prosecutors' Office.

709
00:49:34,248 --> 00:49:36,858
In the end, you're here.

710
00:49:36,858 --> 00:49:39,057
As Do Jun's partner.

711
00:49:39,657 --> 00:49:42,928
Anyway, welcome.

712
00:50:00,307 --> 00:50:02,818
This is Ha In Seok. Jin Do Jun,

713
00:50:02,818 --> 00:50:05,477
I mean, this is the route of 4-2.

714
00:50:12,858 --> 00:50:15,528
You should have told me the truth from the beginning.

715
00:50:15,528 --> 00:50:18,378
If I had known, I wouldn't have come.

716
00:50:18,378 --> 00:50:20,898
Why did you bring me here?

717
00:50:20,898 --> 00:50:23,338
- Because you're qualified. 
 - What?

718
00:50:23,338 --> 00:50:25,068
Seo Min Yeong, the only child of Seo Yoon Ho,

719
00:50:25,068 --> 00:50:29,438
the deputy prosecutor of Seoul District Public Prosecutors' Office Special Unit.

720
00:50:30,438 --> 00:50:32,408
It's a social gathering that suits you.

721
00:50:32,408 --> 00:50:34,277
This Prestigious Club.

722
00:50:36,818 --> 00:50:39,118
"It's a social gathering"?

723
00:50:40,117 --> 00:50:43,288
A friendship where you back each other up when you're in trouble

724
00:50:43,288 --> 00:50:47,288
once you each hold a position after graduating?

725
00:50:47,288 --> 00:50:50,958
Close-knit friendship

726
00:50:50,958 --> 00:50:55,197
that ignores law and policies as if they're nothing?

727
00:50:55,197 --> 00:50:56,967
A social gathering, you said?

728
00:50:56,967 --> 00:50:59,817
Not a gathering of potential criminals?

729
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:03,177
Don't be mistaken, Jin Do Jun.

730
00:51:03,177 --> 00:51:07,107
What you can share here isn't deep friendship.

731
00:51:07,107 --> 00:51:09,477
It's a strong privilege.

732
00:51:09,477 --> 00:51:11,578
It doesn't suit me.

733
00:51:11,578 --> 00:51:17,348
I never had such a privilege nor did I expect one.

734
00:51:20,457 --> 00:51:23,707
You're the one who's mistaken, Seo Min Yeong.

735
00:51:24,527 --> 00:51:29,228
So you think you're free from those privileges?

736
00:51:29,998 --> 00:51:33,037
Because you entered the best university in Korea

737
00:51:33,037 --> 00:51:36,437
with the exam scores you worked hard to achieve with your smart brain.

738
00:51:40,548 --> 00:51:46,447
The fact that you were able to focus solely on studying throughout the three years of high school.

739
00:51:46,447 --> 00:51:51,517
And the fact that you can only focus on studying instead of worrying about making a living now.

740
00:51:51,517 --> 00:51:56,657
Haven't you thought that it's thanks to your parents' financial and mental support?

741
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:01,267
The family of bench and bar for generations.

742
00:52:01,267 --> 00:52:03,937
A healthy body and a smart brain.

743
00:52:03,937 --> 00:52:05,988
Have you never thought...

744
00:52:07,508 --> 00:52:11,730
that all of those were privileges given to you for free

745
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,370
ever since you were born?

746
00:52:30,597 --> 00:52:33,697
About Do Jun, Sir.

747
00:52:33,697 --> 00:52:38,167
He's adjusting well to his university life just like his peers.

748
00:52:41,207 --> 00:52:43,938
- Is that so? 
 - Now's the best time in life.

749
00:52:43,938 --> 00:52:48,277
Even though he has 24 billion won, he's still young.

750
00:52:50,218 --> 00:52:53,888
I wonder what he's thinking.

751
00:52:53,888 --> 00:52:55,987
Oh, well.

752
00:52:55,987 --> 00:52:59,987
You don't even know what your own son is thinking.

753
00:53:00,757 --> 00:53:06,157
He is too distant of a family for me to know about him.

754
00:53:06,157 --> 00:53:12,738
 Hando Steel was declared bankrupt due to its inability to manage the financing cost of the company's debts. 

755
00:53:12,738 --> 00:53:16,077
 Hando Steel has a debt of over four trillion won  (4 billion dollars)  in total. 

756
00:53:16,077 --> 00:53:20,477
 Big social and economic impacts are expected. 

757
00:53:20,477 --> 00:53:22,148
 The company that placed first in wealth ranking. 

758
00:53:22,148 --> 00:53:26,088
 The company with the biggest debt of 4.2 trillion won... 

759
00:53:26,088 --> 00:53:28,318
 collapsed futilely. 

760
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:33,518
Vice-Chairman Jin will attend the meeting with the creditors himself.

761
00:53:36,358 --> 00:53:38,058
   

762
00:53:41,998 --> 00:53:43,938
We have a problem, Sir.

763
00:53:43,938 --> 00:53:46,167
With the acquisition fund of 300 million dollars we prepared,

764
00:53:46,167 --> 00:53:48,338
we might not be able to negotiate.

765
00:53:48,338 --> 00:53:50,038
What are you saying now?

766
00:53:50,038 --> 00:53:53,307
The 500 billion won  (500 million USD)  sale price that the creditors suggested for the sale of Hando Steel,

767
00:53:53,307 --> 00:53:56,148
someone has offered to pay the full amount as the acquisition fund.

768
00:53:56,148 --> 00:53:57,677
Is it Daeyoung?

769
00:53:57,677 --> 00:54:02,317
Actually it's a foreign investment company.

770
00:54:04,188 --> 00:54:07,628
Is there a special reason why a foreign company took over a big Korean company?

771
00:54:07,628 --> 00:54:09,327
Are you going to take over Hando Steel?

772
00:54:09,327 --> 00:54:11,398
Did you really offer 500 billion won?

773
00:54:11,398 --> 00:54:13,597
- Are you going to take over? 
 - Please tell us!

774
00:54:13,597 --> 00:54:16,167
- Why did you do it? 
 - Did you take over the company for 500 billion won?

775
00:54:16,167 --> 00:54:17,697
Of course.

776
00:54:17,697 --> 00:54:21,507
Power Shares is an investment company that focuses on future value.

777
00:54:21,507 --> 00:54:26,037
The 500 billion dollars we offered is the future value of Hando Steel.

778
00:54:26,947 --> 00:54:29,247
An American investment company, Power Shares.

779
00:54:29,247 --> 00:54:31,717
Oh Se Hyeon, the representative for the East Asia region.

780
00:54:31,717 --> 00:54:32,948
   

781
00:54:32,948 --> 00:54:36,148
He's an investment manager who invests in companies' future values.

782
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:41,117
He's a Korean-American who performs exceptionally well when it comes to company takeovers.

783
00:54:41,117 --> 00:54:42,927
Future values?

784
00:54:42,927 --> 00:54:45,498
Why would a foreign investment company

785
00:54:45,498 --> 00:54:47,798
that has been performing exceptionally well

786
00:54:47,798 --> 00:54:49,267
want to take over

787
00:54:49,267 --> 00:54:54,138
a weak and small company like Hando Steel?

788
00:54:54,138 --> 00:54:56,908
Just why?

789
00:55:02,577 --> 00:55:07,117
It's a chess piece.

790
00:55:08,418 --> 00:55:12,858
The chess board must have an owner.

791
00:55:12,858 --> 00:55:15,588
The owner?

792
00:55:16,898 --> 00:55:19,398
Whoever

793
00:55:19,398 --> 00:55:24,438
can't stand to watch Soonyang take over Hando Steel.

794
00:55:27,168 --> 00:55:29,920
That person

795
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:34,530
is the owner of the chess board.

796
00:55:42,417 --> 00:55:44,958
   

797
00:55:49,357 --> 00:55:52,827
   

798
00:55:53,997 --> 00:55:57,668
Gosh, Gyeong Hui. You said your back isn't well.

799
00:55:57,668 --> 00:55:59,768
Oh, dear.

800
00:55:59,768 --> 00:56:02,407
- You'll hurt your back. 
 - It's okay.

801
00:56:02,407 --> 00:56:05,777
- Goodness. 
 - I can't believe this.

802
00:56:07,347 --> 00:56:09,647
- Be careful. 
 - Okay.

803
00:56:11,318 --> 00:56:14,688
You'll hurt yourself.

804
00:56:27,097 --> 00:56:28,967
Did you say he was Oh Se Hyeon?

805
00:56:28,967 --> 00:56:31,167
Yes.

806
00:56:31,167 --> 00:56:33,067
Dig into him.

807
00:56:34,407 --> 00:56:39,967
What he's thinking and who he's meeting.

808
00:56:39,967 --> 00:56:41,878
Yes, Sir.

809
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:56,910


810
00:57:07,237 --> 00:57:10,237
I shouldn't have gotten involved in the first place.

811
00:57:11,338 --> 00:57:17,977
Because of you, I am breaking my first rule of investment for the first time.

812
00:57:19,488 --> 00:57:22,787
The corporate value of Hando Steel is 500 billion won?

813
00:57:22,787 --> 00:57:24,587
No.

814
00:57:24,587 --> 00:57:28,057
Nevertheless, the investor wants to invest in it?

815
00:57:28,057 --> 00:57:30,157
Yes.

816
00:57:31,097 --> 00:57:33,547
Tell me the reason, at least.

817
00:57:33,547 --> 00:57:36,368
Why are you investing so recklessly?

818
00:57:37,068 --> 00:57:41,568
Keep investors' secrets no matter what happens.

819
00:57:42,438 --> 00:57:45,088
That's your investment rule, right?

820
00:57:49,278 --> 00:57:55,328
I have to stop Hando Steel from falling into Vice-Chairman Jin's hands.

821
00:57:55,328 --> 00:57:57,418
Vice-Chairman Jin?

822
00:57:58,418 --> 00:58:02,387
He's your uncle. The successor of Soonyang.

823
00:58:02,387 --> 00:58:05,258
You should be nice to your family, so why...

824
00:58:07,427 --> 00:58:13,738
What you wanted wasn't just Hando Steel?

825
00:58:14,907 --> 00:58:19,738
In the end, what you want is Soonyang.

826
00:58:22,508 --> 00:58:26,078
Do you want to become the owner of Soonyang?

827
00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:33,680
♫   Remember who you are   ♫

828
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:39,080
     

829
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:04,017
    
 ♫  Come on, wake up, bring your destiny  ♫

830
00:59:04,017 --> 00:59:09,110
♫ Boy can't you see, deny your gravity ♫

831
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:14,090
♫  I'm flying, throwing off the fetters  ♫

832
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:20,330
♫  Boy can't you see, deny your gravity  ♫

833
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:25,430
♫  I can't stop the suffocating darkness  ♫

834
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:30,400
♫   I can't walk alone   ♫

835
00:59:33,287 --> 00:59:35,918
 Are you asking because you don't know, or do you want to pretend that you don't know? 

836
00:59:35,918 --> 00:59:37,117
 It's my present. 

837
00:59:37,117 --> 00:59:38,617
 Do Jun. 

838
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:41,728
 I prepared it to welcome you. 

839
00:59:41,728 --> 00:59:45,057
 Don't give me presumptuous advice ever again. 

840
00:59:45,057 --> 00:59:46,768
 Are you going to take over Hando Steel? 

841
00:59:46,768 --> 00:59:49,068
 You want to beat Daeyoung so bad. 

842
00:59:49,068 --> 00:59:52,168
 If you ever let Daeyoung take Hando Steel... 

843
00:59:52,168 --> 00:59:56,307
 The person who gave Daeyoung the money is someone from Soonyang. 

844
00:59:56,307 --> 01:00:00,148
 The eldest son is succeeding. This isn't the Joseon Dynasty. 

845
01:00:00,148 --> 01:00:03,548
 I'll show Father who I am. 

846
01:00:03,548 --> 01:00:06,847
 It's not over until it's over. 

847
01:00:06,847 --> 01:00:11,880
 I never forgave those who went against me. 

848
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:14,560
♫  Throwing off the fetters  ♫

849
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:20,040
♫  Boy can't you see, deny your gravity  ♫
