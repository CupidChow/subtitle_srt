1
00:00:00,494 --> 00:00:04,471
 Y2K is an issue whereby computers are unable to recognize years 2000s. 

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:06,903
 Today is a day before Year 2000. 

3
00:00:06,903 --> 00:00:09,163
 The world is on high alert 

4
00:00:09,163 --> 00:00:13,443
 for a possible attack from Y2K, the millennium bug. 

5
00:00:13,443 --> 00:00:14,948
 An unprecedented situation 

6
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:17,317
 whereby nuclear bombs and nuclear missiles are fired 

7
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:20,984
 due to malfunctioning computers might occur. 

8
00:00:20,984 --> 00:00:22,984
What? It's coming.

9
00:00:22,984 --> 00:00:25,025
It's coming.

10
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,359
It's finally tomorrow.

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,189
   

12
00:00:33,027 --> 00:00:35,598
Are you moving into an air-raid shelter or something?

13
00:00:35,598 --> 00:00:37,798
And stay there for about a year?

14
00:00:37,798 --> 00:00:40,467
An air-raid shelter. Why didn't I think of that?

15
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:42,042
Should I call Grandfather now?

16
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,142
It's Soonyang. I'm sure they're prepared.

17
00:00:44,142 --> 00:00:46,472
Do Jun wasn't worried at all.

18
00:00:46,472 --> 00:00:47,942
What does he know?

19
00:00:47,942 --> 00:00:49,842
Book smart people have poor intuition.

20
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:52,085
Why? They don't need to guess answers when taking exams.

21
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,153
They're not trained for it.

22
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:56,412
So you have good intuition?

23
00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:01,417
The 1999 eschatology that Nostradamus prophesied.

24
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:03,196
He meant this.

25
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:06,362
Nuclear explosion due to Y2K.

26
00:01:06,362 --> 00:01:08,392
Nostradamus?

27
00:01:08,392 --> 00:01:09,670
Do you believe that?

28
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,772
The Great Fire of London in 1666.

29
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,907
The French Revolution in 1789.

30
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:17,211
The Second World War in 1939 and Hitler's appearance.

31
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:18,645
He predicted everything correctly.

32
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:23,547
And someone like him prophesied that the world will end in July 1999.

33
00:01:23,547 --> 00:01:25,181
- July? 
 - Yes.

34
00:01:25,181 --> 00:01:26,887
July has passed.

35
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:28,412
Seriously...

36
00:01:28,412 --> 00:01:31,300
Mother, he's European. There must be a time difference.

37
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:37,650


38
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,862
Did he follow the lunar calendar?

39
00:01:39,862 --> 00:01:40,991
   

40
00:01:40,991 --> 00:01:43,804
The media and customers were very interested

41
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:46,271
in the unlimited compensation policy that Soonyang offered.

42
00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:48,672
Insurance, investment, and electronic-related affiliates,

43
00:01:48,672 --> 00:01:53,501
which could be affected by Y2K, especially received a lot of inquiries.

44
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:57,281
We are facing this situation for the first time since computers were invented.

45
00:01:57,281 --> 00:02:01,412
Isn't the risk too big for a promotional event?

46
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:05,385
We cannot estimate how bad the damage will be from Y2K.

47
00:02:05,385 --> 00:02:07,154
Unlimited compensation is a bit...

48
00:02:07,154 --> 00:02:11,795
This ad was planned by the Chairman's office

49
00:02:11,795 --> 00:02:14,395
and not by the PR Department, right?

50
00:02:14,395 --> 00:02:16,695
Yes.

51
00:02:16,695 --> 00:02:19,094
By the Chairman's office itself?

52
00:02:19,094 --> 00:02:20,705
Other companies are making a fuss about making a law

53
00:02:20,705 --> 00:02:25,004
saying they don't have to compensate for any damage caused by Y2K.

54
00:02:25,004 --> 00:02:26,105
Unlimited compensation?

55
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:28,604
   

56
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,774
Isn't that too reckless?

57
00:02:31,774 --> 00:02:34,415
You said you'd take responsibility.

58
00:02:35,314 --> 00:02:43,484
Regardless of how much the compensation is, it's coming out of your pocket.

59
00:02:45,054 --> 00:02:49,364
Instead, if Y2K passes by without any issues,

60
00:02:49,364 --> 00:02:52,735
you should do me a favor.

61
00:02:53,735 --> 00:02:56,064
 The button is pressed. 

62
00:02:56,064 --> 00:02:58,404
 The pendulum starts swinging. 

63
00:02:58,404 --> 00:03:00,705
 - President Kim Dae Jung is present.  
 - Five,

64
00:03:00,705 --> 00:03:03,814
four, three.. 
   - Three. 

65
00:03:03,814 --> 00:03:06,784
- two, one. 
  - Two, one. 

66
00:03:06,784 --> 00:03:08,685
 Everyone. 

67
00:03:09,644 --> 00:03:13,674
 The 21st century has begun. 

68
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,254
 The start of the new millennium. 

69
00:03:18,254 --> 00:03:21,395
 Year 2000 is here. 

70
00:03:23,895 --> 00:03:25,572
 We can hear their voices. 

71
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,635
Y2K. Millennium bug.

72
00:03:28,635 --> 00:03:30,734
The end of the world.

73
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:34,681
Nostradamus, that con artist!

74
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,815
Darn it! What was that?

75
00:03:36,815 --> 00:03:39,375
The 21st century has begun. 
    

76
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,645
   

77
00:03:43,484 --> 00:03:45,284
Okay.

78
00:03:47,555 --> 00:03:49,524
You saved your money.

79
00:03:50,755 --> 00:03:53,354
The computation of investment business and insurance companies are fine,

80
00:03:53,354 --> 00:03:57,235
and the semiconductor factory has no issue as well.

81
00:03:58,734 --> 00:04:02,604
I think you earned more than ten billion won  ($10M)  just now.

82
00:04:02,604 --> 00:04:04,374
Thanks to me.

83
00:04:07,075 --> 00:04:08,544
   

84
00:04:10,674 --> 00:04:13,634
Could any other advertisement be as effective as this?

85
00:04:18,055 --> 00:04:19,854
What is it?

86
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,724
Do you want anything as your graduation gift?

87
00:04:27,695 --> 00:04:31,134
What is the favor you want from me?

88
00:04:34,835 --> 00:04:38,075
Happy New Year, Grandfather.

89
00:04:51,614 --> 00:04:53,455
   

90
00:05:03,734 --> 00:05:05,594
January 1, 2000.

91
00:05:05,594 --> 00:05:10,805
The temperature is 22Â°C and humidity is 62 percent.

92
00:05:12,734 --> 00:05:15,716
- Good morning. 
 - Happy New Year, CEO Jin.

93
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:18,996
Looking forward to working with you this year as well, Director Im.

94
00:05:21,085 --> 00:05:23,414
The 2000 sales strategy meeting

95
00:05:23,414 --> 00:05:25,185
with the district directors of Soonyang Market will be held

96
00:05:25,185 --> 00:05:27,784
in the conference room on the eleventh floor at 9 a.m.

97
00:05:27,784 --> 00:05:30,497
- Right. Cancel that. 
 - Sorry?

98
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,364
I called the managers of Soonyang Investment.

99
00:05:33,364 --> 00:05:36,025
It's a closed door meeting, by the way.

100
00:05:43,974 --> 00:05:46,875
CEO Jin, some directors came from Gwangju, Busan,

101
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:51,405
and Jeju Island yesterday to attend today's meeting.

102
00:05:51,405 --> 00:05:53,814
- So? 
 - Sorry?

103
00:05:53,814 --> 00:05:56,223
Do the transportation and accommodation fees

104
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:59,015
come from their pockets? I pay for them all.

105
00:05:59,015 --> 00:06:00,954
What's the problem?

106
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:04,555
Last year, I earned more money from New Data Technology stocks

107
00:06:04,555 --> 00:06:08,524
than the department store sales.

108
00:06:08,524 --> 00:06:11,695
Think before you work. Get your priorities straight.

109
00:06:11,695 --> 00:06:13,734
I apologize.

110
00:06:13,734 --> 00:06:17,235
Well, CEO Jin.

111
00:06:17,235 --> 00:06:22,345
You have made enough. You should stop investing in shares...

112
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:26,075
They said it'll go up to 300,000 won  ($300) .

113
00:06:30,815 --> 00:06:32,885
I need to get back my share of the department store

114
00:06:32,885 --> 00:06:36,154
that I gave to Miracle Investment as collateral.

115
00:06:36,154 --> 00:06:37,731
As soon as it goes up to 300,000 won,

116
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,125
I'll get back my share, and that's it. The end.

117
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,094
300,000 won?  ($300) 

118
00:06:42,094 --> 00:06:45,964
This is a phenomenon that has
never happened in Korean investment market before,

119
00:06:45,964 --> 00:06:48,605
so any prediction is meaningless.

120
00:06:48,605 --> 00:06:50,574
Looking at the data, if you just consider the corporate value,

121
00:06:50,574 --> 00:06:53,045
the current stock price is a bubble.

122
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:57,244
The stock price could plummet and halve the current price anytime.

123
00:06:57,244 --> 00:06:59,886
"Plummet?" Are you sure?

124
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,214
How low will it drop?

125
00:07:01,214 --> 00:07:03,085
- Well... 
 - CEO Jin.

126
00:07:03,085 --> 00:07:06,825
Pardon me for asking, but how much did you invest?

127
00:07:06,825 --> 00:07:09,255
Am I the one making the report here?

128
00:07:09,255 --> 00:07:11,325
No. I'm sorry.

129
00:07:11,325 --> 00:07:15,265
Aren't you experts in investment? Why can't you answer me?

130
00:07:15,265 --> 00:07:18,164
Will it go up to 300,000 won?

131
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,904
300,000 won! 300,000 won!  ($300) 

132
00:07:21,904 --> 00:07:23,835
Will it go up to 300,000 won?

133
00:07:25,774 --> 00:07:26,980
Will it?

134
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,216
 As KOSDAQ Composite hits 2,834, 

135
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:34,454
 the stock price of New Data Technology keeps rising. 

136
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,255
 Yesterday, the trading market closed at 280,000 won ($280). 

137
00:07:37,255 --> 00:07:40,984
Did you say it will go up to 300,000 won to CEO Jin Hwa Young?

138
00:07:40,984 --> 00:07:42,354
Yes.

139
00:07:43,155 --> 00:07:45,925
It will go higher at this rate.

140
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:49,495
The stock price of New Data Technology isn't decided by the market.

141
00:07:49,495 --> 00:07:51,664
It's decided by the era.

142
00:07:51,664 --> 00:07:53,607
The IT era.

143
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:57,010
If a vague fear brought about the Y2k urban myth,

144
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,646
greed for infinite possibilities

145
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:03,175
is appearing in the form of New Data Technology and venture companies.

146
00:08:03,175 --> 00:08:04,815
Since the start of the new millennium.

147
00:08:04,815 --> 00:08:08,088
 It is predicted to continue rising. 

148
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:10,955
Please sell all of the New Data Technology stocks

149
00:08:10,955 --> 00:08:13,585
that Miracle Investment owns, CEO Oh.

150
00:08:13,585 --> 00:08:14,785
Now?

151
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:17,124
 Unreasonable investment and rapid growth... 

152
00:08:17,124 --> 00:08:20,494
The truth of the Y2K myth was revealed.

153
00:08:20,494 --> 00:08:24,195
The New Data Technology frenzy will show its true colors soon too.

154
00:08:24,195 --> 00:08:26,034
Sell them.

155
00:08:29,068 --> 00:08:30,734
Wait.

156
00:08:30,734 --> 00:08:32,805
 CEO Lee Myung Soo of New Data Technology 

157
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:34,575
 is suspected of being involved in accounting fraud. 

158
00:08:34,575 --> 00:08:35,604
 Prosecutors are investigating the issue. 

159
00:08:35,604 --> 00:08:37,014
 Soonyang Electronics that pushed forward 

160
00:08:37,014 --> 00:08:39,644
 with a technological alliance with New Data Technology 

161
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,521
 scrapped the plan. 

162
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,415
 The plan to merge New Data Technology and One Road, 

163
00:08:44,415 --> 00:08:47,085
 the biggest mobile carrier in Korea, fell through in the end. 

164
00:08:47,085 --> 00:08:49,384
 As the stock price of New Data Technology continued to fall, 

165
00:08:49,384 --> 00:08:52,065
 KOSDAQ Composite fell below 520. 

166
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:53,925
 Its stock price today is 5,500 won ($5.50), 

167
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:57,694
 which is an 18 percent drop. 

168
00:09:05,175 --> 00:09:08,774
I'm Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong of FTCD at Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

169
00:09:08,774 --> 00:09:11,451
FTCD stands for Financial and Tax Crime Department.

170
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:15,714
It's a department that investigates crimes related to finance, stocks,

171
00:09:15,714 --> 00:09:18,455
and tax.

172
00:09:18,455 --> 00:09:21,535
I'm a newly-appointed prosecutor that was appointed this year.

173
00:09:22,525 --> 00:09:25,894
Was that okay? Or should I try one more time?

174
00:09:35,464 --> 00:09:37,805
   

175
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:42,474
   

176
00:09:47,344 --> 00:09:48,915
   

177
00:09:55,855 --> 00:09:58,225
I was assigned cases, right?

178
00:09:58,225 --> 00:10:01,265
Are the investigation records here? Where are they?

179
00:10:02,964 --> 00:10:05,164
Well...

180
00:10:05,964 --> 00:10:08,904
In the cabinet over there.

181
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:20,844
Excuse me, Prosecutor Seo.

182
00:10:20,844 --> 00:10:23,514
You're going to tomorrow's interview with the women's magazine, right?

183
00:10:23,514 --> 00:10:26,355
There will be a photoshoot.

184
00:10:26,355 --> 00:10:28,354
The theme is a female prosecutor.

185
00:10:28,354 --> 00:10:32,154
The magazine company prepared this, or so I heard.

186
00:10:33,764 --> 00:10:36,364
The chief prosecutor is in the office, right?

187
00:10:38,134 --> 00:10:41,205
For the past three months since my probation period ended,

188
00:10:41,205 --> 00:10:46,075
you never assigned me a proper case.

189
00:10:46,075 --> 00:10:48,705
Do you know that?

190
00:10:48,705 --> 00:10:50,344
So?

191
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,585
I don't feel like I'm worth my salt,

192
00:10:55,585 --> 00:10:59,455
and I feel bad that I can't face you.

193
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:03,527
I am ashamed of myself.

194
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,364
Teach me what I'm lacking,

195
00:11:09,364 --> 00:11:11,404
and I'll do my best to correct it.

196
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:14,007
What are you saying, Prosecutor Seo?

197
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:17,310
Your existence alone is FTCD's pride.

198
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,734
Didn't you know that?

199
00:11:18,734 --> 00:11:21,709
You're more than worth your salt.

200
00:11:25,374 --> 00:11:28,354
You have an interview with a women's magazine tomorrow, right?

201
00:11:29,505 --> 00:11:32,514
After Chief Prosecutor resigned from his post because of lobbying,

202
00:11:32,514 --> 00:11:34,727
the public opinion was terrible.

203
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:37,055
Especially those women that love to talk.

204
00:11:37,055 --> 00:11:38,525
You show them

205
00:11:38,525 --> 00:11:42,664
how women-friendly prosecution is.

206
00:11:43,234 --> 00:11:46,533
I'll do my best.

207
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:56,144
   

208
00:12:02,884 --> 00:12:06,915
Yes. I'm Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong.

209
00:12:06,915 --> 00:12:08,784
Who's calling?

210
00:12:15,565 --> 00:12:17,365
Welcome.

211
00:12:17,365 --> 00:12:19,594
This way, please.

212
00:12:42,425 --> 00:12:44,625
Long time no see.

213
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:48,032
Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong.

214
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:57,306
I didn't know you still had my number.

215
00:12:57,306 --> 00:13:00,275
I thought you knew.

216
00:13:02,505 --> 00:13:05,245
Your number was still the same,

217
00:13:05,245 --> 00:13:08,178
so I thought you were waiting for a call.

218
00:13:34,604 --> 00:13:36,444
Let me go.

219
00:13:36,444 --> 00:13:37,644
Get a grip.

220
00:13:37,644 --> 00:13:40,545
Losing money was enough. Do you want to lose the department store as well?

221
00:13:40,545 --> 00:13:42,188
Let me go!

222
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:45,085
You need to make up for the money you spent on the stocks first.

223
00:13:45,085 --> 00:13:46,825
If you keep postponing the payment

224
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,828
to the stores in the department store,

225
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,994
they will take legal action against the department store.

226
00:13:51,994 --> 00:13:53,094
Are you okay with that?

227
00:13:53,094 --> 00:13:55,624
Are you threatening me, Director Im?

228
00:14:00,605 --> 00:14:02,604
It means the prosecutors will come to notice

229
00:14:02,604 --> 00:14:06,275
that you embezzled the company funds.

230
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,744
We still have time.

231
00:14:15,744 --> 00:14:19,955
Only the two of us know that.

232
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,335
Do you want me to investigate the embezzlement

233
00:14:32,335 --> 00:14:35,305
of CEO Jin Hwa Young of Soonyang Department Store?

234
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:40,021
Are you giving me a tip?

235
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:47,988
So we're here today as a prosecutor and an informant.

236
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,754
Then I should make it clear.

237
00:14:52,754 --> 00:14:54,055
We'll split the bill.

238
00:14:54,055 --> 00:14:57,394
I can't make the informant pay for me.

239
00:14:57,394 --> 00:14:58,925
   

240
00:14:58,925 --> 00:15:02,764
The price is not mentioned.

241
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:13,546
The person in front of me sure is a grandson of a conglomerate family.

242
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:17,715
You meet people at a restaurant where price doesn't matter

243
00:15:17,715 --> 00:15:20,445
and report a family member to the prosecutors

244
00:15:20,445 --> 00:15:23,315
as a suspect of a serious crime.

245
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:27,555
So you'll jump in and join the war of succession?

246
00:15:27,555 --> 00:15:32,094
Using the prosecutors... No, using me?

247
00:15:32,094 --> 00:15:35,624
Why? Can't I do that?

248
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:40,404
Let's say, for the sake of Korea's financial justice,

249
00:15:40,404 --> 00:15:43,304
I put my beloved family

250
00:15:43,304 --> 00:15:48,734
on the judgment seat despite the excruciating pain.

251
00:15:48,734 --> 00:15:52,514
Does the result of the investigation change?

252
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:58,415
If you're not confident, I understand.

253
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:02,784
It's no other company but Soonyang that you have to fight against.

254
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:06,695
You passed the bar exam as first place in the country

255
00:16:06,695 --> 00:16:11,435
and are talented enough to be assigned to FTCD.

256
00:16:11,435 --> 00:16:15,464
But it still must be too much for a newly-appointed prosecutor, right?

257
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:19,339
I understand, I mean it.

258
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,494
I'll be off first.

259
00:16:27,885 --> 00:16:30,414
How much

260
00:16:30,414 --> 00:16:33,193
was the estimated amount of CEO Jin Hwa Young's embezzlement again?

261
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:42,295
Let me use a third-generation heir to realize justice.

262
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,634
Prosecutor Seo, here.

263
00:16:47,634 --> 00:16:51,735
This is the fund analysis of CEO Jin Hwa Young I got

264
00:16:51,735 --> 00:16:53,204
from tracking her transaction history.

265
00:16:53,204 --> 00:16:55,548
Did you find any suspicious activity that points to embezzlement?

266
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:58,114
No, I couldn't.

267
00:16:58,114 --> 00:17:01,944
Soonyang is an expert in this regard.

268
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:07,755
Instead, I found a very interesting account.

269
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,964
Look here. Since last September and October,

270
00:17:16,964 --> 00:17:18,995
from Soonyang Department Store's corporate account,

271
00:17:18,995 --> 00:17:20,294
ten billion won  ($10M) 

272
00:17:20,294 --> 00:17:22,965
was split into 300M and 400M won  ($300k and $400k) 

273
00:17:22,965 --> 00:17:24,975
and were transferred to dozens of accounts.

274
00:17:24,975 --> 00:17:26,475
Are they clients of the department store?

275
00:17:26,475 --> 00:17:29,745
These dozens of accounts have different account holder names

276
00:17:29,745 --> 00:17:33,575
and banks, but they have one thing in common.

277
00:17:34,944 --> 00:17:38,785
That is the location of each branch.

278
00:17:38,785 --> 00:17:41,654
Look here. Hoehyeon-dong, Chungmuro, and Euljiro.

279
00:17:41,654 --> 00:17:42,884
All of these places are...

280
00:17:42,884 --> 00:17:44,330
It's Myeong-dong, Myeong-dong.

281
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,134
She set up a huge money laundry place in the private loan market in Myeong-dong.

282
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:47,967
Bingo.

283
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:50,428
So where did the laundered money go?

284
00:17:50,428 --> 00:17:52,628
Right. Here.

285
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,035
Soonyang Deco.

286
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:59,078
Outside, it's a business partner of Soonyang Department Store.

287
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,414
Inside, we don't know.

288
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:02,571
Because all transactions of Soonyang Deco

289
00:18:02,571 --> 00:18:04,951
are the funds from Soonyang Department Store

290
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:07,754
that went through money laundering here. 
    

291
00:18:08,479 --> 00:18:10,078
It's a paper company.

292
00:18:10,078 --> 00:18:12,919
She set up a phantom company named Soonyang Deco

293
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:15,388
and embezzled the company funds.

294
00:18:15,388 --> 00:18:17,858
Mr. Song. Put out a warrant on them.

295
00:18:17,858 --> 00:18:19,729
We'll serve a search and seizure warrant on Soonyang Department Store

296
00:18:19,729 --> 00:18:23,159
and subpoena CEO Jin Hwa Young for investigation.

297
00:18:25,868 --> 00:18:27,628
   

298
00:18:30,739 --> 00:18:32,068
   

299
00:18:35,278 --> 00:18:37,779
What are you doing?

300
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:39,185
What's happening?

301
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:42,679
Someone reported suspicion of embezzlement.

302
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:45,819
How dare you ransack my office without me!

303
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:48,218
Do you know who I am?

304
00:18:48,888 --> 00:18:50,528
You're CEO Jin Hwa Young, right?

305
00:18:50,528 --> 00:18:54,688
I'm Investigator Song Gye Ok of Financial and Tax Crime Department, Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

306
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:56,700
   

307
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,668
We are summoning you for questioning as a suspect for embezzlement.

308
00:19:06,909 --> 00:19:08,939
My wife did?

309
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,009
   

310
00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:17,578
I was too busy with national affairs that I neglected my family.

311
00:19:17,578 --> 00:19:18,848
Don't mention it.

312
00:19:18,848 --> 00:19:22,718
Seocho-dong has fresher air, but Gwanghwamun sells better liquor.

313
00:19:22,718 --> 00:19:25,429
Yes, come with the others.

314
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:28,659
Let's meet up.

315
00:19:28,659 --> 00:19:30,899
Yes. Thank you.

316
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:32,699
See you.

317
00:19:41,808 --> 00:19:45,708
Are you managing your minions or not?

318
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,424
Do you even know what I just went through?

319
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,219
The investigation will be done behind closed doors.

320
00:19:55,219 --> 00:19:59,128
Wrap it up internally before the press finds out.

321
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:02,958
Put back the money you spent, and the charges will be dropped.

322
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,499
The money?

323
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,438
The money?

324
00:20:07,438 --> 00:20:11,869
Would this be happening to me if I had the money?

325
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:15,674
The money you lost in the stock market.

326
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:19,644
Was it the department store's funds?

327
00:20:27,915 --> 00:20:30,529
   

328
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,765
Go to your father and ask for help.

329
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:34,624
What shall I say?

330
00:20:34,624 --> 00:20:35,868
What shall I tell him?

331
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:39,438
Should I tell him I embezzled company funds?

332
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:43,042
That I lost 140 billion won  ($140M)  on the stock market?

333
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:46,512
How do you still not know my father?

334
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:49,975
The day he finds out will be the day my life ends.

335
00:20:49,975 --> 00:20:52,645
Good for you.

336
00:20:52,645 --> 00:20:56,188
What a great family you come from.

337
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:59,054
You have no qualms about breaking the law,

338
00:20:59,054 --> 00:21:02,795
but you won't dare do anything to upset your father.

339
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,194
I don't care.

340
00:21:04,194 --> 00:21:07,824
You must help me.

341
00:21:07,824 --> 00:21:09,902
You have prosecutor friends.

342
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:13,465
Plus, aren't you the Mayor of Seoul?

343
00:21:13,465 --> 00:21:18,105
If you can't use your authority, why'd you waste a fortune to get into politics?

344
00:21:18,105 --> 00:21:21,134
Pull yourself together, Jin Hwa Young!

345
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,684
You should've grown up 30 years ago.

346
00:21:27,684 --> 00:21:29,585
I'm the Mayor of Seoul and the next presidential candidate.

347
00:21:29,585 --> 00:21:32,565
I made my name by attacking the rich, and you...

348
00:21:32,565 --> 00:21:35,324
Your being investigated for embezzlement is bad news for me.

349
00:21:35,324 --> 00:21:38,594
That you lost over 100 billion won  ($100M)  in the speculative stock market?

350
00:21:38,594 --> 00:21:39,665
It's a calamity.

351
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:43,394
You're about to cut my political life short. You!

352
00:21:43,394 --> 00:21:45,565
- Honey. 
 - Hands off.

353
00:21:45,565 --> 00:21:47,704
You, get out.

354
00:21:47,704 --> 00:21:50,743
Go to your father and play sweet and coy or beg on your knees.

355
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:52,734
Ask him to save you just this once.

356
00:21:52,734 --> 00:21:57,104
Only then will I let you spend the rest of your life as Mayor Choi Chang Je's wife.

357
00:21:57,944 --> 00:21:58,990
Honey.

358
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,810
I said go!

359
00:22:09,025 --> 00:22:11,398
Get my car. Head to Jeongsimjae.

360
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:13,500
- I can't. 
 - CEO Jin.

361
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,069
I can't go to Jeongsimjae.

362
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:18,295
Not Jeongsimjae.

363
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,374
As much as 140 billion won  ($140M)? 

364
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,704
That's more than I expected.

365
00:22:29,704 --> 00:22:33,151
I heard Soonyang Department Store makes quite a lot.

366
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:35,985
Did you have any other business issues?

367
00:22:42,684 --> 00:22:45,655
Shall I wire you the money now?

368
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,364
You can do that? Right now?

369
00:22:47,364 --> 00:22:49,525
I told you.

370
00:22:49,525 --> 00:22:53,565
If you want anything from us, all you must do is pay the due price.

371
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,804
I'll buy it from you for 140 billion.

372
00:22:56,804 --> 00:22:58,704
The Soonyang Department Store shares you own

373
00:22:58,704 --> 00:23:02,005
under borrowed names, all 25 percent.

374
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:05,545
Not again. Do you want more shares?

375
00:23:05,545 --> 00:23:07,215
For just 140 billion won  ($140M) ?

376
00:23:08,414 --> 00:23:12,785
Listen. You told me to pay the due price.

377
00:23:12,785 --> 00:23:17,785
Do you even know how much the department store shares are traded for right now?

378
00:23:17,785 --> 00:23:21,901
As of yesterday, they trade for less than 15,000 won  ($15)  per share.

379
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,765
Do you remember the stipulation

380
00:23:23,765 --> 00:23:27,994
on the contract you signed when we lent you the 400 billion won  ($400M) ?

381
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:33,904
To ensure the collateral's value in case stock prices dropped,

382
00:23:33,904 --> 00:23:36,344
we added a conditional clause.

383
00:23:37,145 --> 00:23:38,874
   

384
00:23:38,874 --> 00:23:41,614
If stock prices go below 15,000 won  ($15) , the 30 percent stake

385
00:23:41,614 --> 00:23:45,254
you offered as collateral is transferred to Miracle.

386
00:23:45,254 --> 00:23:46,914
The repayment period has lapsed,

387
00:23:46,914 --> 00:23:49,994
and your shares are worth less than 15,000 won  ($15)  each.

388
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:54,594
Legal action will be taken to transfer your 30 percent stake

389
00:23:54,594 --> 00:23:58,095
in Soonyang Department Store to us.

390
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:03,208
Is this it?

391
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,035
The reason you want

392
00:24:05,035 --> 00:24:09,504
my hidden 25 percent stake for 140 billion won  ($140M) ?

393
00:24:09,504 --> 00:24:11,815
On top of the 30 percent you took behind my back,

394
00:24:11,815 --> 00:24:14,715
you'll take another 25 percent

395
00:24:14,715 --> 00:24:18,785
to take over my department store with 55 percent ownership?

396
00:24:20,215 --> 00:24:24,025
You still are a hunter.

397
00:24:24,025 --> 00:24:27,495
This is a hostile takeover.

398
00:24:28,224 --> 00:24:31,294
We stayed true to our partnership.

399
00:24:31,294 --> 00:24:35,635
And it was always you who came to us first.

400
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:39,579
When I take over... No.

401
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:42,414
When I hunt down a company, I have only one rule.

402
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:46,244
My prey are undervalued companies due to incompetent management.

403
00:24:46,244 --> 00:24:48,414
Like your department store that,

404
00:24:48,414 --> 00:24:52,785
despite high sales figures, fails to pay off its debts.

405
00:24:53,614 --> 00:24:56,085
Behind me is Soonyang Group

406
00:24:56,085 --> 00:24:58,554
and Chairman Jin Yang Cheol.

407
00:24:58,554 --> 00:25:03,064
Congratulations. You have a great set of parents.

408
00:25:08,065 --> 00:25:09,665
Do Jun.

409
00:25:13,034 --> 00:25:15,604
Do Jun.

410
00:25:15,604 --> 00:25:18,644
Get rid of him. Get rid of CEO Oh!

411
00:25:18,644 --> 00:25:20,784
Aren't you Miracle's majority shareholder?

412
00:25:20,784 --> 00:25:23,745
Must I deal with a puppet of a CEO?

413
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:29,854
Let's keep the department store collateral deal between us.

414
00:25:29,854 --> 00:25:32,654
Between you and I, family.

415
00:25:35,225 --> 00:25:37,595
I'm sorry, Aunt.

416
00:25:37,595 --> 00:25:39,895
Miracle's referee

417
00:25:39,895 --> 00:25:42,804
is and will be CEO Oh.

418
00:25:42,804 --> 00:25:46,445
Isn't that why you visited him in the first place?

419
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:48,275
Instead of me, your family?

420
00:25:48,275 --> 00:25:49,915
Do Jun, I...

421
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,383
If I were you,

422
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,815
I'd hand over the 25 percent stake for 140 billion.

423
00:25:54,815 --> 00:25:57,315
Before prices fall even further.

424
00:26:01,924 --> 00:26:04,254
CEO Oh...

425
00:26:04,254 --> 00:26:08,825
never buys anything unless it's worth the money.

426
00:26:15,835 --> 00:26:17,504
Goodbye.

427
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:32,424
The chairman's blood flows in you.

428
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,554
What?

429
00:26:33,554 --> 00:26:37,085
You got a prosecutor involved.

430
00:26:37,085 --> 00:26:38,394
   

431
00:26:38,394 --> 00:26:41,071
You must know many other prosecutors.

432
00:26:41,071 --> 00:26:42,465
Why did you go to Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong?

433
00:26:42,465 --> 00:26:44,594
   

434
00:26:49,464 --> 00:26:51,076
   

435
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:53,505
I plan to subpoena her tomorrow

436
00:26:53,505 --> 00:26:56,145
and question her for embezzling

437
00:26:56,145 --> 00:26:58,575
using a paper company.

438
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:01,685
If my suspicion is confirmed,

439
00:27:01,685 --> 00:27:05,226
I'll follow protocol to have her booked.

440
00:27:05,226 --> 00:27:07,214
Not bad, Seo Min Yeong.

441
00:27:07,214 --> 00:27:10,585
The people high up are quite interested in you.

442
00:27:10,585 --> 00:27:14,996
Don't forget that how female prosecutors are

443
00:27:14,996 --> 00:27:19,695
and will be treated depends on you.

444
00:27:20,694 --> 00:27:23,200
I'll do my best, Sir.

445
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,380
   

446
00:27:37,444 --> 00:27:38,984
Goodness...

447
00:27:38,984 --> 00:27:41,184
   

448
00:27:43,797 --> 00:27:45,667
Hey!

449
00:27:45,667 --> 00:27:48,794
Goodness, you poor...

450
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,765
You look dreadful.

451
00:27:52,765 --> 00:27:55,665
Oh, Dear...

452
00:27:55,665 --> 00:27:57,934
So what if I own a stock firm?

453
00:27:57,934 --> 00:28:02,044
I had no idea at all.

454
00:28:02,874 --> 00:28:06,244
I heard the rumor a prosecutor was onto you,

455
00:28:06,244 --> 00:28:08,484
and I thought they were playing around

456
00:28:08,484 --> 00:28:11,285
to drop share prices.

457
00:28:11,285 --> 00:28:13,354
A rumor?

458
00:28:13,354 --> 00:28:15,255
Who would play around?

459
00:28:15,255 --> 00:28:18,096
Someone who wants the stock prices

460
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:20,132
of your department store to plummet.

461
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:22,495
Someone who owns a stake in it

462
00:28:22,495 --> 00:28:26,534
or wants to buy more cheaply.

463
00:28:27,241 --> 00:28:29,505
 If stock prices go below 15,000 won ($15), 

464
00:28:29,505 --> 00:28:31,975
 the 30 percent stake you offered as collateral 

465
00:28:31,975 --> 00:28:34,305
 is transferred to Miracle. 

466
00:28:35,644 --> 00:28:36,949
Miracle's Oh Se Hyeon.

467
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:38,344
 If I were you, 

468
00:28:38,344 --> 00:28:42,315
 I'd hand over the 25-percent stake for 140 billion won ($140M) .

469
00:28:42,315 --> 00:28:44,385
 Before prices fall even further. 

470
00:28:44,385 --> 00:28:47,184
Jin Do Jun, that jerk!

471
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:53,325
It's okay. Don't you worry.

472
00:28:53,325 --> 00:28:55,594
We worked so hard to build up that department store.

473
00:28:55,594 --> 00:28:59,434
Would I just let Miracle gobble it up?

474
00:28:59,434 --> 00:29:04,464
Shall I give you the money to get you out of trouble first?

475
00:29:04,464 --> 00:29:06,104
Will you do that?

476
00:29:06,104 --> 00:29:09,644
Your worst days are over.

477
00:29:09,644 --> 00:29:11,105
Oppa Dong Ki!

478
00:29:11,105 --> 00:29:14,114
Spend more time supporting your husband

479
00:29:14,114 --> 00:29:18,449
and toss me whatever shares you still own of the department store.

480
00:29:18,449 --> 00:29:22,055
- What? 
 - I'm much better than Do Jun, don't you think?

481
00:29:22,055 --> 00:29:26,995
We're full siblings born from the same parents.

482
00:29:28,194 --> 00:29:30,794
- Oppa Dong Ki. 
 - Yes.

483
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,104
That crazy... Hwa Young!

484
00:29:40,104 --> 00:29:42,275
Darn her.

485
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:46,975
 You must know New Data Technology. 

486
00:29:46,975 --> 00:29:51,520
 It began at 1,500 won ($1.5), then reached 10,000 won ($10) in a week, so that's seven times. 

487
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:56,354
 It'll surely rise up to at least 40,000 won ($40). 

488
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:58,694
 Well, 

489
00:29:58,694 --> 00:30:02,295
 I hear they'll take the flight up to 300,000 won ($300). 

490
00:30:02,295 --> 00:30:05,525
 But who knows when this defective aircraft will take the plunge? 

491
00:30:05,525 --> 00:30:08,235
 But I guess it's high risk, high return. 

492
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:14,975
That punk Do Jun. This was his plan from the start.

493
00:30:14,975 --> 00:30:19,244
He did all this to take over the department store...

494
00:30:19,244 --> 00:30:21,214
No.

495
00:30:21,214 --> 00:30:23,385
It was me.

496
00:30:24,215 --> 00:30:27,315
He set the trap for me!

497
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,194
Do you see it, Father?

498
00:30:39,194 --> 00:30:42,735
It's all Do Jun's fault.

499
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:50,249
All because of Do Jun,

500
00:30:50,249 --> 00:30:54,074
you lost 140 billion won  ($140M) on the stock market, 

501
00:30:54,074 --> 00:30:56,514
as well as your stake in the department store,

502
00:30:56,514 --> 00:30:58,115
and now...

503
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,485
a prosecutor is investigating you?

504
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:05,694
- Is that it? 
 - Yes, father. I feel so wronged!

505
00:31:05,694 --> 00:31:07,655
Hwa Young!

506
00:31:08,194 --> 00:31:11,864
Will you please answer my question?

507
00:31:13,005 --> 00:31:16,334
Did Do Jun twist your arm,

508
00:31:16,334 --> 00:31:19,247
forcing you to buy those shares?

509
00:31:20,904 --> 00:31:23,904
Then did he sign the contract to make you

510
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:26,574
- dip into company funds? 
 - No.

511
00:31:26,574 --> 00:31:30,188
Do you have proof Do Jun sent a prosecutor after you?

512
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:32,985
- No, but that's... 
 - I just...

513
00:31:32,985 --> 00:31:35,284
don't get it.

514
00:31:35,284 --> 00:31:38,154
How is...

515
00:31:38,154 --> 00:31:39,525
Do Jun at fault?

516
00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:40,750
Father.

517
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,424
Stop it!

518
00:31:42,424 --> 00:31:45,480
Are you using your nephew as an excuse?

519
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,907
How callous of you.

520
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:52,375
You lost 140 billion  ($140M)  of my precious money,

521
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:55,905
and you still learned nothing at all?

522
00:31:58,275 --> 00:32:00,114
Father, father, father!

523
00:32:00,114 --> 00:32:03,284
Father! Father!

524
00:32:05,084 --> 00:32:07,655
Lend me the money.

525
00:32:09,025 --> 00:32:11,085
The 140 billion  ($140M) .

526
00:32:12,495 --> 00:32:14,094
What?

527
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,436
One hundred and forty billion?

528
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:20,135
If your only daughter were to go to prison,

529
00:32:20,135 --> 00:32:22,265
you wouldn't be able to sleep at night.

530
00:32:22,265 --> 00:32:25,374
Wouldn't that be better than your old dad

531
00:32:25,374 --> 00:32:28,435
spending time behind bars?

532
00:32:28,435 --> 00:32:29,445
What?

533
00:32:29,445 --> 00:32:32,515
Have you forgotten that when I gave you the department store,

534
00:32:32,515 --> 00:32:34,660
I made it a separate entity?

535
00:32:35,575 --> 00:32:38,356
If 140 billion were to go from Soonyang Corporation

536
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:40,857
to the Department store for no good reason,

537
00:32:40,857 --> 00:32:43,798
that becomes dereliction of duty and embezzlement!

538
00:32:48,065 --> 00:32:50,394
Stand up.

539
00:32:50,394 --> 00:32:55,234
Hwa Young, I don't worry about you at all.

540
00:32:55,234 --> 00:32:56,508
Why don't I?

541
00:32:56,508 --> 00:33:00,074
You have your husband.

542
00:33:00,074 --> 00:33:03,482
Didn't I let you marry that uncouth prosecutor,

543
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:06,017
so we could use him at a time like this?

544
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:09,545
He became the Mayor with your money.

545
00:33:09,545 --> 00:33:13,155
Wouldn't he help you out?

546
00:33:14,454 --> 00:33:15,684
Wouldn't he?

547
00:33:15,684 --> 00:33:18,485
Father...

548
00:33:20,124 --> 00:33:23,724
You married into his family, and you're his problem now.

549
00:33:25,272 --> 00:33:29,012
- Cry all you want there. 
 - Father.

550
00:33:29,012 --> 00:33:31,864
I won't give you a cent.

551
00:33:41,385 --> 00:33:43,345
Mom.

552
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:47,622
I might go to prison.

553
00:33:48,495 --> 00:33:54,665
Father said he wouldn't help me.

554
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:56,764
Get a grip.

555
00:33:56,764 --> 00:33:58,825
Get a grip!

556
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:04,078
The old man has no grace at all.

557
00:34:04,078 --> 00:34:05,646
No. Could you, Mom...

558
00:34:05,646 --> 00:34:07,677
Come and sit down.

559
00:34:09,516 --> 00:34:11,546
What should I do?

560
00:34:15,784 --> 00:34:16,615
Oh, dear...

561
00:34:16,615 --> 00:34:20,225
Father has always been merciless.

562
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:23,194
So what if he values his eldest child and all that?

563
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:27,495
My Seong Jun is getting all moldy in the warehouse.

564
00:34:27,495 --> 00:34:30,624
He's someone who will send his only daughter to prison.

565
00:34:30,624 --> 00:34:32,404
A grandson is an extra stretch.

566
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:36,035
You have nothing to worry about, Hwa Young.

567
00:34:36,035 --> 00:34:38,304
You have two reliable older brothers.

568
00:34:38,304 --> 00:34:39,774
"Reliable?"

569
00:34:40,434 --> 00:34:42,405
Oh, they're reliable?

570
00:34:42,405 --> 00:34:46,315
Mom, do you know what Oppa Dong Ki said?

571
00:34:46,315 --> 00:34:49,173
As if Oppa Young Ki would be better...

572
00:34:49,757 --> 00:34:52,215
That's enough, Ms. Hwa Young.

573
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:55,454
Don't embarrass yourself in front of the new addition.

574
00:34:59,954 --> 00:35:01,933
Have some jujube tea.

575
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:05,270
It'll help you calm down.

576
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,505
Yes.

577
00:35:06,505 --> 00:35:09,405
Take a long sip of the hot tea

578
00:35:09,405 --> 00:35:11,704
and pull yourself together.

579
00:35:19,315 --> 00:35:23,944
Will you call the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office?

580
00:35:23,944 --> 00:35:25,985
No need.

581
00:35:27,015 --> 00:35:29,524
I'm a referee.

582
00:35:31,665 --> 00:35:38,065
I'll keep a whistle in my hand and stand right here.

583
00:35:47,235 --> 00:35:49,874
You must be getting old, too.

584
00:35:49,874 --> 00:35:52,414
You worry too much.

585
00:35:56,115 --> 00:35:59,685
Will you be okay with how things turn out?

586
00:36:01,184 --> 00:36:05,424
Be a nice father and expand Soonyang.

587
00:36:06,254 --> 00:36:10,125
I can't have my cake and eat it.

588
00:36:11,664 --> 00:36:14,095
That's pure greed.

589
00:36:31,514 --> 00:36:33,454
Aunt.

590
00:36:40,754 --> 00:36:44,264
I'll accompany you to the prosecutor's office.

591
00:37:02,744 --> 00:37:04,144
Dear Heavenly Father.

592
00:37:04,144 --> 00:37:08,315
Please help me and save me from this mess.

593
00:37:08,315 --> 00:37:12,332
The investigation is not open, so there will be no press.

594
00:37:14,555 --> 00:37:17,365
Try to relax.

595
00:37:18,025 --> 00:37:21,695
It's quite a small world.

596
00:37:22,834 --> 00:37:28,504
The prosecutor who subpoenaed you was Do Jun's law school classmate.

597
00:37:30,104 --> 00:37:32,345
Is that true?

598
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,262
CEO Jin.

599
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,825
Do you admit to

600
00:37:45,825 --> 00:37:50,924
embezzling 140 billion won of Soonyang Department Store funds?

601
00:37:51,765 --> 00:37:58,765
Do you admit to using a paper company called Soonyang Deco in the process?

602
00:38:03,405 --> 00:38:05,250
Soonyang Deco.

603
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:09,284
On paper, it holds five construction licenses.

604
00:38:09,284 --> 00:38:10,985
But another document shows

605
00:38:10,985 --> 00:38:15,855
it only hired and paid employees who worked for less than twenty hours a month.

606
00:38:15,855 --> 00:38:16,654
   

607
00:38:16,654 --> 00:38:18,763
In cases like this, it's one or the other.

608
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:21,965
It's a shell company that exists only on paper,

609
00:38:21,965 --> 00:38:26,594
or you're an immoral boss who breaks the Labor Standard Law and Minimum Wage Act.

610
00:38:26,594 --> 00:38:29,195
There's one more possibility.

611
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:35,904
This case is built on a false report.

612
00:38:35,904 --> 00:38:39,274
Do you deny all the charges?

613
00:38:39,274 --> 00:38:43,744
I'm alerting you to a new crime.

614
00:38:44,684 --> 00:38:46,555
What if someone

615
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:50,684
approached a naive newly-appointed prosecutor

616
00:38:50,684 --> 00:38:55,394
and lied that I embezzled company funds?

617
00:38:56,065 --> 00:38:58,403
What if they used this investigation to shake the stock market

618
00:38:58,403 --> 00:39:01,573
to cause Soonyang Department Store's stocks to fall?

619
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:05,435
What if they planned all this to obtain my shares

620
00:39:05,435 --> 00:39:10,634
at the value of nothing so they could take over the department store?

621
00:39:10,634 --> 00:39:14,245
What happens then?

622
00:39:14,245 --> 00:39:16,087
Then

623
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:21,385
that person will be punished for fraudulent and illegal transactions.

624
00:39:21,385 --> 00:39:23,354
Okay.

625
00:39:26,824 --> 00:39:32,494
I did not embezzle any funds.

626
00:39:32,494 --> 00:39:34,795
We'll find out soon.

627
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:41,535
My investigators are at the address on Soonyang Deco's file.

628
00:39:41,535 --> 00:39:43,204
I see.

629
00:39:43,204 --> 00:39:47,619
Once we prove Soonyang Deco is a paper company,

630
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:53,885
that should also prove the report that you embezzled is not fraudulent.

631
00:39:56,385 --> 00:39:58,254
- Hello? 
 - Prosecutor Seo.

632
00:39:58,254 --> 00:39:59,994
The Soonyang Deco office.

633
00:39:59,994 --> 00:40:01,399
- Make the call. 
 - Okay.

634
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:06,565
   

635
00:40:06,565 --> 00:40:09,135
It's not a paper company.

636
00:40:09,804 --> 00:40:11,905
Okay, thank you.

637
00:40:16,805 --> 00:40:19,604
Do you get it now?

638
00:40:19,604 --> 00:40:22,744
I am not guilty of embezzlement.

639
00:40:22,744 --> 00:40:24,615
I am the victim here.

640
00:40:24,615 --> 00:40:26,291
Those who are pushing for a hostile takeover

641
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:29,354
are attacking me to take Soonyang Department Store away from me.

642
00:40:29,354 --> 00:40:32,354
They're using you, Prosecutor Seo.

643
00:40:34,894 --> 00:40:40,375
I heard you and Do Jun went to the same law school.

644
00:40:43,164 --> 00:40:45,464
You see,

645
00:40:45,464 --> 00:40:50,344
you should've summoned the one who sent in the false tip, not me.

646
00:40:50,344 --> 00:40:53,905
You should've charged that person with fraud and unfair trading.

647
00:40:55,945 --> 00:40:59,010
How did you come up with such a brilliant idea?

648
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:01,184
You didn't study law, did you?

649
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:04,724
I consulted my family's lawyer.

650
00:41:04,724 --> 00:41:07,355
I don't know much about the law.

651
00:41:07,355 --> 00:41:11,532
But I do know Do Jun quite well.

652
00:41:12,494 --> 00:41:13,695
Do Jun?

653
00:41:13,695 --> 00:41:16,541
When he was deceiving Grandfather and the others in the family

654
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:21,834
while acting like an ordinary college student, I could see right through him.

655
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,419
Those things can't be hidden.

656
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:31,785
He's incredibly smart, detail-oriented,

657
00:41:31,785 --> 00:41:36,324
diligent, magnanimous, and brave.

658
00:41:38,254 --> 00:41:44,725
He's got all the qualities that Grandfather would love.

659
00:41:46,065 --> 00:41:48,294
I suppose you were

660
00:41:48,294 --> 00:41:51,394
immensely interested in Do Jun. You seem to know a lot about him.

661
00:41:52,934 --> 00:41:54,505
Yes.

662
00:41:56,905 --> 00:42:01,574
And that's why there should be no place for him at Soonyang.

663
00:42:04,115 --> 00:42:06,684
I'm sure you'd agree.

664
00:42:20,235 --> 00:42:23,004
By now, they should've summoned and questioned CEO Jin Hwa Young.

665
00:42:23,004 --> 00:42:25,405
Why is it so quiet?

666
00:42:25,405 --> 00:42:28,275
Shouldn't she be coming to us saying she doesn't want to go to jail

667
00:42:28,275 --> 00:42:31,204
and asking us for the 140 billion won?

668
00:42:31,204 --> 00:42:33,914
"Give me the money, and I'll give you my shares."

669
00:42:33,914 --> 00:42:37,744
That was the happy ending I was expecting, you know?

670
00:42:38,815 --> 00:42:42,315
I don't like surprises.

671
00:42:44,054 --> 00:42:46,094
   

672
00:42:46,094 --> 00:42:47,854
   

673
00:42:47,854 --> 00:42:50,234
Miracle Investment?

674
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:54,135
Yes, it's an investment company founded in 1997.

675
00:42:54,135 --> 00:42:58,207
Recently, 30 percent of CEO Jin Hwa Young's shares in the department store

676
00:42:58,207 --> 00:43:00,205
were transferred to Miracle.

677
00:43:00,205 --> 00:43:03,114
That's a lot of shares to be transferred at once.

678
00:43:03,114 --> 00:43:06,517
Soonyang Department Store owned Miracle some money.

679
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:07,870
When their stock price dropped,

680
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:11,240
Miracle gained ownership over the shares they had used as collateral.

681
00:43:11,244 --> 00:43:13,624
Oh, right. You asked me to find out if it had anything to do

682
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:16,285
with the Soonyang Group owner's family.

683
00:43:16,285 --> 00:43:18,025
Here.

684
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:19,930
   

685
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,995
The majority shareholder of Miracle is Soonyang chairman's grandson,

686
00:43:23,995 --> 00:43:26,164
Jin Do Jun.

687
00:43:34,835 --> 00:43:39,545
 What if they planned all this to obtain my shares 

688
00:43:39,545 --> 00:43:45,674
 at the value of nothing so they could take over the department store? 

689
00:43:45,674 --> 00:43:48,624
 So you'll jump in and join the war of succession? 

690
00:43:48,624 --> 00:43:53,794
 Using the prosecutors... No, using me? 

691
00:43:53,794 --> 00:43:55,854
 Why? 

692
00:43:55,854 --> 00:43:58,025
 Can't I do that? 

693
00:44:06,911 --> 00:44:11,504
I figured you'd want to know what happened with CEO Jin Hwa Young,

694
00:44:11,504 --> 00:44:13,874
since you were the tipper.

695
00:44:13,874 --> 00:44:15,545
Oh, that.

696
00:44:16,814 --> 00:44:21,515
In conclusion, we couldn't get anything out of it.

697
00:44:23,084 --> 00:44:28,254
There were definitely circumstances that made me suspect embezzlement,

698
00:44:28,254 --> 00:44:33,167
but am I just not good enough yet? I couldn't prove it.

699
00:44:34,635 --> 00:44:42,139
I suppose I still have a lot to learn before I can go up against the Soonyang family.

700
00:44:42,139 --> 00:44:44,574
I bet you think that, too.

701
00:44:50,244 --> 00:44:52,115
Hey.

702
00:44:54,814 --> 00:44:57,454
Why did you give me that tip?

703
00:45:02,995 --> 00:45:06,355
The third-generation heir to Soonyang Group.

704
00:45:06,355 --> 00:45:10,864
You can influence many competent prosecutors with just your name.

705
00:45:12,235 --> 00:45:14,304
So why me?

706
00:45:18,845 --> 00:45:20,745
Because I know.

707
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:27,485
You, Seo Min Yeong, will become an admirable prosecutor.

708
00:45:28,784 --> 00:45:31,354
One that the rich are afraid of.

709
00:45:32,525 --> 00:45:35,754
One that makes the powerful uncomfortable.

710
00:45:35,754 --> 00:45:38,164
A decent prosecutor.

711
00:45:41,164 --> 00:45:43,524
I know Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong well enough.

712
00:45:44,635 --> 00:45:46,635
That's why.

713
00:45:51,204 --> 00:45:53,075
Liar.

714
00:45:53,815 --> 00:45:55,515
What?

715
00:45:55,515 --> 00:45:57,215
Seo Tai Ji.

716
00:45:57,215 --> 00:46:01,155
You said he'd make a comeback in 2000.

717
00:46:01,155 --> 00:46:07,184
You told me that, looking as if you knew everything just like right now.

718
00:46:09,324 --> 00:46:11,024
Comeback, my foot.

719
00:46:11,024 --> 00:46:15,735
Half the year is gone already, and there's still no news.

720
00:46:28,914 --> 00:46:34,385
You lied to me.

721
00:47:12,424 --> 00:47:15,594
   

722
00:47:15,594 --> 00:47:17,065
   

723
00:47:17,065 --> 00:47:20,245
   

724
00:47:20,245 --> 00:47:22,395
I see a blank.

725
00:47:22,395 --> 00:47:24,634
Are you on duty today?

726
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:26,204
What about you, Ma'am?

727
00:47:26,204 --> 00:47:28,205
I'm staying late to study.

728
00:47:28,205 --> 00:47:32,705
You mentioned a blank. Where?

729
00:47:32,705 --> 00:47:35,885
For this to constitute an unfair trade practice...

730
00:47:35,885 --> 00:47:37,485
Here.

731
00:47:38,315 --> 00:47:43,654
You'd need firm evidence that the tip was false.

732
00:47:43,654 --> 00:47:46,184
Something like that.

733
00:47:46,184 --> 00:47:47,698
 Evidence that the tip was false. 

734
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:52,824
Evidence to prove that Do Jun deliberately gave me false information?

735
00:47:55,935 --> 00:47:57,174
   

736
00:47:57,174 --> 00:48:01,312
The department store's suppliers and partners are all suffering.

737
00:48:01,312 --> 00:48:05,149
The six-month promissory notes are all due at the end of the month.

738
00:48:05,149 --> 00:48:09,614
The ones she issued, instead of cash, when she started to invest in New Data technology last year.

739
00:48:09,614 --> 00:48:12,185
If she can't pay them, the company will go under.

740
00:48:12,185 --> 00:48:14,254
And she's still not calling us?

741
00:48:14,254 --> 00:48:17,555
What is she thinking?

742
00:48:20,994 --> 00:48:23,365
I'm stepping out.

743
00:48:24,295 --> 00:48:26,595
CEO Jin Hwa Young should step down!

744
00:48:26,595 --> 00:48:28,564
- Step down! 
 - Step down!

745
00:48:28,564 --> 00:48:30,865
Soonyang's subcontractors want to live!

746
00:48:30,865 --> 00:48:33,005
- We want to live! 
 - We want to live!

747
00:48:33,005 --> 00:48:35,505
Guarantee our right to livelihood!

748
00:48:35,505 --> 00:48:37,504
- Guarantee it! 
 - Guarantee it!

749
00:48:37,504 --> 00:48:39,574
Soonyang must learn its lessons!

750
00:48:39,574 --> 00:48:41,615
- Learn your lessons! 
 - Learn your lessons!

751
00:48:41,615 --> 00:48:44,244
Shut down Soonyang Department Store!

752
00:48:44,244 --> 00:48:46,354
- Shut it down! 
 - Shut it down!

753
00:48:46,354 --> 00:48:48,954
Guarantee our right to livelihood!

754
00:48:48,954 --> 00:48:50,985
- Guarantee it! 
 - Guarantee it!

755
00:48:50,985 --> 00:48:53,354
Soonyang's subcontractors want to live!

756
00:48:53,354 --> 00:48:55,664
 - We want to live! 
 - We want to live! 

757
00:48:55,664 --> 00:48:58,269
 CEO Jin Hwa Young should step down! 

758
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,295
-  Step down! 
 - Step down! 

759
00:49:00,295 --> 00:49:02,735
 Soonyang's subcontractors want to live! 

760
00:49:02,735 --> 00:49:04,764
 - We want to live! 
 - We want to live! 

761
00:49:04,764 --> 00:49:07,374
 Guarantee our right to livelihood! 

762
00:49:07,374 --> 00:49:10,345
 - Guarantee it! 
 - Guarantee it! 

763
00:49:12,344 --> 00:49:15,114
   

764
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:46,245
I heard 140 billion won  ($140M)  would be enough to clear all your outstanding payments.

765
00:49:47,345 --> 00:49:50,914
Just hand over the shares, Aunt Hwa Young.

766
00:49:51,925 --> 00:49:53,994
Do Jun.

767
00:49:53,994 --> 00:49:55,354
Wake up already.

768
00:49:55,354 --> 00:50:00,784
I will not hand them over to you even if it'd cost me my life.

769
00:50:00,784 --> 00:50:02,325
It's just 140 billion  ($140M) .

770
00:50:02,325 --> 00:50:04,524
Do you think I'll give up the department store over that?

771
00:50:04,524 --> 00:50:07,164
I won't let you fool me twice.

772
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:11,704
The hotel, the golf course, and the resort.

773
00:50:11,704 --> 00:50:15,244
I'll sell everything valuable. I need two months at the most.

774
00:50:19,563 --> 00:50:23,604
Two months is a long time for those people.

775
00:50:25,485 --> 00:50:29,614
To you, it's just enough time to start dressing differently for a new season.

776
00:50:29,614 --> 00:50:32,154
But for poor people,

777
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:38,794
they'll become poorer day by day at an accelerating rate.

778
00:50:38,794 --> 00:50:40,271
Poverty has a compound interest.

779
00:50:40,271 --> 00:50:43,674
So? Are you saying poor people can't even wait two months?

780
00:50:43,674 --> 00:50:48,174
Gosh, I'm sick and tired of dealing with them.

781
00:50:48,174 --> 00:50:53,080
Because they're so impatient, they'll suffer in poverty for the rest of their lives.

782
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,075
Good grief.

783
00:50:59,026 --> 00:51:03,085
Then why do you think you can be sitting there now?

784
00:51:06,754 --> 00:51:12,695
You handed over 30 percent of the shares to Miracle as soon as the split-off occurred.

785
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:20,164
Then you lost 140 billion won in stocks, yet you can still sit there looking so confident.

786
00:51:20,164 --> 00:51:23,335
There's only one reason for that.

787
00:51:27,275 --> 00:51:30,885
You were born into the Soonyang family. That's why.

788
00:51:30,885 --> 00:51:33,314
And you did nothing to earn it.

789
00:51:33,314 --> 00:51:35,654
It was pure luck.

790
00:51:35,654 --> 00:51:40,265
A lucky chance that those people did not have.

791
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:43,495
So?

792
00:51:48,509 --> 00:51:51,949
You won't be able to step down on your own.

793
00:51:52,675 --> 00:51:55,405
   

794
00:51:55,405 --> 00:51:58,546
Since you didn't earn it on your own.

795
00:52:46,694 --> 00:52:48,795
   

796
00:52:54,741 --> 00:52:59,079
 I'm so forgetful. I forgot to pay the bill. 

797
00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:02,619
 I'll go to the bank later and... 

798
00:53:03,704 --> 00:53:06,704
   

799
00:53:10,485 --> 00:53:14,080
   

800
00:53:20,595 --> 00:53:23,195
 Good luck on the exam tomorrow. 

801
00:53:24,001 --> 00:53:25,764
 Wait. 

802
00:53:25,764 --> 00:53:27,295
 Yes? 

803
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:44,245
 Do you want to buy these? 

804
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:47,454
 Buy them off me. I'll sell them cheaply. 

805
00:53:47,454 --> 00:53:50,784
 I have a hard time focusing on studying because of music. 

806
00:53:51,954 --> 00:53:53,725
 You'll buy them, right? 

807
00:53:55,554 --> 00:54:00,120
   

808
00:54:03,034 --> 00:54:05,464
   

809
00:54:05,464 --> 00:54:08,350
   

810
00:54:14,215 --> 00:54:17,160
   

811
00:55:15,174 --> 00:55:16,874
 Gosh, it's hot. 

812
00:55:16,874 --> 00:55:18,874
 It looks delicious. Thank you for making this! 

813
00:55:18,874 --> 00:55:22,245
 No problem. Eat up, Hyeon Min. 

814
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:34,925
 If your mom was around, she'd make you all your favorite dishes. 

815
00:55:34,925 --> 00:55:36,564
 Eat up, son. 

816
00:55:36,564 --> 00:55:40,965
 So you'll have the energy to prepare for the exam. 

817
00:56:05,255 --> 00:56:07,425
 - I've been waiting for hours. 
 - Me, too. 

818
00:56:07,425 --> 00:56:08,755
 - This is annoying. 
 - Darn it. 

819
00:56:08,755 --> 00:56:11,138
 Goodness. What's going on? 

820
00:56:11,138 --> 00:56:12,472
 I think so, too. 

821
00:56:12,472 --> 00:56:15,031
 - It's taking forever. 
 - What are they doing? 

822
00:56:15,031 --> 00:56:16,532
 - Can you go check? 
 - Hold on. 

823
00:56:16,532 --> 00:56:19,873
 - Let's wait. 
 - But this is... 

824
00:56:23,905 --> 00:56:26,604
 - Park Jun Mo? 
 - Yes! l

825
00:56:27,374 --> 00:56:29,075
 - An Ju Ho? 
 - Yes, here! 

826
00:56:29,075 --> 00:56:30,621
 - Kim Ju Sik? 
 - Yes! 

827
00:56:30,621 --> 00:56:32,445
 - Park Jun Mo? 
 - Yes! 

828
00:56:32,445 --> 00:56:33,955
 Yoon Hyeon Woo? 

829
00:56:33,955 --> 00:56:37,654
   

830
00:56:37,654 --> 00:56:40,755
 Is Yoon Hyeon Woo not here? 

831
00:56:40,755 --> 00:56:42,895
 Yes, I'm coming! 

832
00:56:42,895 --> 00:56:45,525
   

833
00:56:45,525 --> 00:56:49,670
 What I gave up on wasn't the college entrance exam 

834
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:52,997
 or the four years of college life. 

835
00:56:52,997 --> 00:56:57,784
 That morning, the only option I had 

836
00:56:57,784 --> 00:57:03,745
 was to choose to do my best to become even poorer. 

837
00:57:06,385 --> 00:57:10,284
 There are 24 hours in a day and 365 days in a year. 

838
00:57:10,284 --> 00:57:15,154
 They say time is fair to everyone. 

839
00:57:15,894 --> 00:57:20,494
 However, time isn't fair. 

840
00:57:21,465 --> 00:57:26,105
 Just like everything else in this world. 

841
00:57:45,425 --> 00:57:47,501
The ten billion won  ($10M)  favor you owe me.

842
00:57:47,501 --> 00:57:49,931
Can I ask you for it now?

843
00:57:49,931 --> 00:57:52,024
You.

844
00:57:52,773 --> 00:57:57,313
Are you here to pick up your promissory note that you left on new year's day?

845
00:57:58,635 --> 00:58:03,134
Please talk to the board members of Soonyang Department Store.

846
00:58:04,604 --> 00:58:07,464
We need to call a board meeting...

847
00:58:07,464 --> 00:58:10,515
- to discuss... 
 - I don't need to hear it.

848
00:58:10,515 --> 00:58:18,928
I don't care to know whether you want to trick everyone or pull a prank.

849
00:58:22,454 --> 00:58:25,426
So you just want me to call a board meeting?

850
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:28,783
Then I don't owe you anything anymore.

851
00:58:35,132 --> 00:58:36,550
- What? 
 - What is this?

852
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:38,305
- Embezzlement and breach of duty? 
 - I don't believe this.

853
00:58:38,305 --> 00:58:40,344
- What will happen to us then? 
 - No way.

854
00:58:40,344 --> 00:58:41,644
This is nuts.

855
00:58:41,644 --> 00:58:43,385
- Embezzlement? 
 - What is this?

856
00:58:43,385 --> 00:58:45,045
I can't believe this. 
    

857
00:58:45,045 --> 00:58:46,823
I did not see this coming. 
    

858
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:47,955
This is crazy.

859
00:58:47,955 --> 00:58:49,355
No way! 
    

860
00:58:49,355 --> 00:58:51,108
- Embezzlement? Seriously? 
 - Right?

861
00:58:51,108 --> 00:58:53,195
   

862
00:58:53,195 --> 00:58:55,394
Who moved the board members?

863
00:58:55,394 --> 00:58:58,535
Who initiated the talk on my dismissal?

864
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:01,834
I heard Miracle was attending the board meeting as well.

865
00:59:01,834 --> 00:59:03,534
Miracle?

866
00:59:03,534 --> 00:59:04,934
You mean, Do Jun?

867
00:59:04,934 --> 00:59:07,275
Not announcing the fact that Miracle is now

868
00:59:07,275 --> 00:59:11,035
the majority shareholder of the department store is considered dereliction of duty,

869
00:59:11,035 --> 00:59:13,504
so he's attending as a witness...

870
00:59:15,245 --> 00:59:17,285
Please don't worry too much, Ma'am.

871
00:59:17,285 --> 00:59:20,656
If you take your time and explain yourself at the meeting...

872
00:59:21,258 --> 00:59:23,454
- Director Im. 
 - Yes, CEO.

873
00:59:23,454 --> 00:59:26,985
Should I explain myself? Why?

874
00:59:26,985 --> 00:59:28,165
Pardon me?

875
00:59:28,165 --> 00:59:31,095
You were the one who created the slush fund,

876
00:59:31,095 --> 00:59:32,336
using the borrowed-name account,

877
00:59:32,336 --> 00:59:36,872
and tweaked our agreements with the retail vendors.

878
00:59:36,872 --> 00:59:40,334
And you're the director of finance.

879
00:59:40,334 --> 00:59:42,974
Yet you stood by and watched while I was losing all that money

880
00:59:42,974 --> 00:59:44,750
because of that stupid stock.

881
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:48,560
That is a clear case of dereliction of duty.

882
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,844
Am I wrong?

883
00:59:50,844 --> 00:59:56,314
At the board meeting, I'll do my very best to help you.

884
00:59:56,314 --> 01:00:01,385
But should the board decide to sue you,

885
01:00:02,995 --> 01:00:09,195
our friendship will evolve to the next level.

886
01:00:10,334 --> 01:00:12,635
Just think about that.

887
01:00:15,405 --> 01:00:18,305
Thank you for all your hard work, Director Im.

888
01:00:27,215 --> 01:00:31,954
It was an honor to assist you, Ma'am.

889
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:05,285
July 19, 2000.

890
01:01:05,285 --> 01:01:08,025
The CEO's orders.

891
01:01:14,035 --> 01:01:15,735
The end.

892
01:01:33,454 --> 01:01:35,815
Hello, Im Myeong Sook speaking.

893
01:01:40,497 --> 01:01:44,034
Are you telling me to say at the board meeting

894
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:48,541
that CEO Jin committed embezzlement?

895
01:01:53,735 --> 01:01:55,504
You were wrong about me if you thought I'd do it.

896
01:01:55,504 --> 01:01:59,974
I will stay loyal to her.

897
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,914
Is this the kind of loyalty you're talking about?

898
01:02:06,914 --> 01:02:08,962
"Never disobey any orders by the owner's family."

899
01:02:08,962 --> 01:02:10,724
"Never ask any questions."

900
01:02:10,724 --> 01:02:14,025
"Never make your own decisions."

901
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:17,324
Because of your loyalty to CEO Jin,

902
01:02:17,324 --> 01:02:21,394
you'll now be held legally responsible for everything.

903
01:02:24,274 --> 01:02:26,643
I'll think of it as another star on my shoulders.

904
01:02:26,643 --> 01:02:30,180
The other directors envy me since it's such a huge honor.

905
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:33,415
I see. Because she'll take care of you after you retire.

906
01:02:33,415 --> 01:02:38,085
I've worked harder and more diligently than anyone else I know for nearly 40 years.

907
01:02:38,085 --> 01:02:41,658
Should I really be criticized for wanting a stable retirement?

908
01:02:41,658 --> 01:02:45,425
For signing in CEO Jin's stead while working for Soonyang

909
01:02:45,425 --> 01:02:50,524
and paying for it in your retirement?

910
01:02:55,642 --> 01:03:02,781
To stay loyal to her, you're betraying yourself every day.

911
01:03:17,454 --> 01:03:20,355
   

912
01:03:20,355 --> 01:03:24,364
I am Lee Hang Jae, the chairperson of the board meeting.

913
01:03:25,865 --> 01:03:31,995
Today's agenda is the dismissal of CEO Jin Hwa Young.

914
01:03:33,043 --> 01:03:36,246
We will hear from the witness and CEO Jin herself

915
01:03:36,246 --> 01:03:41,105
regarding the dereliction of duty case and take votes by a show of hands.

916
01:03:41,105 --> 01:03:42,715
   

917
01:03:42,715 --> 01:03:44,715
   

918
01:03:46,445 --> 01:03:48,854
   

919
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:52,755
Could you contact CEO Jin Hwa Young at Soonyang?

920
01:03:52,755 --> 01:03:55,155
Yes, Ma'am.

921
01:03:55,155 --> 01:03:57,662
Ma'am, a package arrived for you earlier...

922
01:03:57,662 --> 01:03:59,624
Oh, you already got it.

923
01:03:59,624 --> 01:04:02,745
What was inside?

924
01:04:02,745 --> 01:04:05,565
I've managed to fill in the blank.

925
01:04:06,874 --> 01:04:09,775
Evidence to prove that the tip was false.

926
01:04:10,545 --> 01:04:12,175
   

927
01:04:12,175 --> 01:04:15,974
Embezzlement?

928
01:04:15,974 --> 01:04:17,614
   

929
01:04:17,614 --> 01:04:19,715
   

930
01:04:20,684 --> 01:04:22,415
No.

931
01:04:24,054 --> 01:04:25,525
It is not true.

932
01:04:25,525 --> 01:04:27,130
   

933
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:32,232
A false tip was sent to the prosecutors to make our stock price drop.

934
01:04:32,232 --> 01:04:34,195
It was orchestrated by Miracle Investment

935
01:04:34,195 --> 01:04:37,855
where my nephew, Jin Do Jun, is the majority shareholder.

936
01:04:37,855 --> 01:04:41,504
To steal my shares, which they're holding as collateral.

937
01:04:42,212 --> 01:04:43,713
And thanks to it,

938
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:48,774
he's sitting here now as the majority shareholder of Soonyang Department Store.

939
01:04:48,774 --> 01:04:52,045
   

940
01:04:52,045 --> 01:04:54,384
Is this true?

941
01:04:58,224 --> 01:05:00,724
Instead of answering this question,

942
01:05:00,724 --> 01:05:06,325
I will prove that CEO Jin is indeed guilty of embezzlement.

943
01:05:06,325 --> 01:05:08,534
Right here and now.

944
01:05:11,405 --> 01:05:14,675
Do you have solid evidence?

945
01:05:15,837 --> 01:05:17,505
Well...

946
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:26,544
The one who's been managing the department store's finances as per CEO Jin's orders,

947
01:05:27,655 --> 01:05:31,135
Director Im Myeong Sook, will give a statement. Would that do?

948
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,754
Why is he suddenly bringing up Director Im?

949
01:05:32,754 --> 01:05:35,454
- Why is she here? 
 - What is going on?

950
01:05:35,454 --> 01:05:38,464
- I thought she was on our side. 
 - My gosh.

951
01:05:38,464 --> 01:05:40,995
- What? 
 - Gosh.

952
01:06:46,965 --> 01:06:49,965
 Director Im disappeared right before my eyes. 

953
01:06:51,835 --> 01:06:54,164
   

954
01:06:54,835 --> 01:06:58,645
Why is Director Im not here yet?

955
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:16,124
Hello? Police?

956
01:07:16,124 --> 01:07:19,165
I'd like to report someone missing.

957
01:07:19,165 --> 01:07:21,994
Someone disappeared right before my eyes.

958
01:07:25,479 --> 01:07:29,479
We'll keep you safe until the board meeting is over.

959
01:07:37,224 --> 01:07:40,114
There is only one reason the witness isn't here yet.

960
01:07:40,114 --> 01:07:43,385
There is nothing to prove.

961
01:07:45,154 --> 01:07:46,724
Now, do you see the truth?

962
01:07:46,724 --> 01:07:50,569
The truth behind this accusation of embezzlement.

963
01:07:51,295 --> 01:07:53,829
It all started with a false tip.

964
01:07:57,704 --> 01:08:04,304
The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office has already investigated it.

965
01:08:10,915 --> 01:08:15,284
I'm Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong of FTCD at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

966
01:08:29,009 --> 01:08:32,840
We have secured solid evidence that the tip was false.

967
01:08:40,970 --> 01:08:47,930


968
01:08:49,115 --> 01:08:51,650
   

969
01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:59,030
  â« I guess I still can't let you go â«  

970
01:08:59,030 --> 01:09:06,440
  â« I long for you like a fool. â«  

971
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:12,820
  â« Please remember me, my different faces â«  

972
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:16,240
  â« a love we both wanted â«   

973
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:21,780
  â« I wonât let go of it like this â«   

974
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:23,350
  â« We loved each other â«  

975
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:26,525
 Here is the plan for establishing Soonyang financial holding company. 

976
01:09:26,525 --> 01:09:28,394
 The manufacturing industries are now dead. 

977
01:09:28,394 --> 01:09:30,464
 We must start a moneylending business to survive. 

978
01:09:30,464 --> 01:09:31,764
 Bingo. 

979
01:09:31,764 --> 01:09:37,595
 The owner of the financial holding company will become the owner of Soonyang Group. 

980
01:09:37,595 --> 01:09:41,475
 And this will be a good opportunity for Miracle. 

981
01:09:41,475 --> 01:09:42,905
 We received a complaint. 

982
01:09:42,905 --> 01:09:46,604
 A third-generation conglomerate family member is one of the people who manipulated stock prices. 

983
01:09:46,604 --> 01:09:48,184
 The rich are always greedier. 

984
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:49,486
 I am Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong. 

985
01:09:49,486 --> 01:09:51,044
 Will you cooperate? 

986
01:09:51,044 --> 01:09:53,289
 A trial doesn't only take place in court. 

987
01:09:53,289 --> 01:10:00,492
 If the picture he wants to paint is the same as mine, it wouldn't be a bad idea for Dong Ki to take my seat. 

988
01:10:00,492 --> 01:10:03,554
 Miracle Investment... 

989
01:10:04,295 --> 01:10:06,035
 Soonyang Investment will acquire the company. 

990
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:07,264
 Do Jun. 

991
01:10:07,264 --> 01:10:12,120
 Do you think I trust you?
