1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,350
   

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:05,060
   

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:13,960


4
00:00:20,115 --> 00:00:22,816
You know Miracle Investment, right?

5
00:00:22,816 --> 00:00:26,318
They're the majority shareholder of Jea Construction,

6
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:32,388
that messed with you so nicely and took over New Seoul Town's management rights.

7
00:00:33,029 --> 00:00:34,658
Then

8
00:00:34,658 --> 00:00:39,929
do you also know who the company's real owner is?

9
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:42,669
You're talking like you know who it is.

10
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:45,735
Who is it?

11
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:29,545
I'm Miracle's majority shareholder, Jin Do Jun.

12
00:01:33,085 --> 00:01:34,555
What?

13
00:01:36,185 --> 00:01:37,926
You're...

14
00:01:40,856 --> 00:01:46,795
The majority shareholder hiding behind Oh Se Hyeon is you, Do Jun?

15
00:01:48,895 --> 00:01:50,936
Is that what you're saying?

16
00:01:54,342 --> 00:01:58,243
Using Chang Je to humiliate me

17
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,942
and taking the New Seoul Town project...

18
00:02:04,152 --> 00:02:07,682
That was you, Do Jun?

19
00:02:11,453 --> 00:02:13,693
You used my reluctance to give up on cars

20
00:02:13,693 --> 00:02:18,363
and used Ahjin Motors as bait to take Soonyang Motors' shares.

21
00:02:19,562 --> 00:02:25,163
You forced me to buy Hando Steel at an exorbitant price to drain our funds.

22
00:02:25,163 --> 00:02:30,402
You did all that with Oh Se Hyeon as a pawn, to toy with me to do this and that?

23
00:02:31,843 --> 00:02:35,342
The punk who dared to challenge me

24
00:02:38,552 --> 00:02:41,383
was Jin Yang Cheol's youngest grandson.

25
00:02:44,092 --> 00:02:46,392
Jin Do Jun.

26
00:02:50,432 --> 00:02:52,533
Was it really you?

27
00:02:55,562 --> 00:02:57,573
Yes, Grandfather.

28
00:03:02,302 --> 00:03:07,243
They were all decisions I made as Miracle's majority shareholder.

29
00:03:07,243 --> 00:03:08,883
Why?

30
00:03:08,883 --> 00:03:12,552
Why did you do such a thing? Why?

31
00:03:15,252 --> 00:03:19,592
Did you think this would make me

32
00:03:19,592 --> 00:03:23,363
leave Soonyang to you when you're not my eldest grandson?

33
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,963
No, Grandfather.

34
00:03:36,412 --> 00:03:40,312
I'd like to buy Soonyang.

35
00:03:44,383 --> 00:03:45,912
What?

36
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,922
I will buy Soonyang.

37
00:03:54,623 --> 00:03:56,523
With my money.

38
00:03:58,762 --> 00:04:04,533
   

39
00:04:06,073 --> 00:04:10,603
Who is Miracle's true owner?

40
00:04:11,442 --> 00:04:14,912
Do you really not know?

41
00:04:14,912 --> 00:04:18,413
You got knocked out the moment you stepped into the ring.

42
00:04:18,413 --> 00:04:22,723
I thought you'd know all about your opponent by now.

43
00:04:22,723 --> 00:04:28,563
Isn't that the only way you can try to have a rematch?

44
00:04:30,393 --> 00:04:36,063
You're a nicer person than I thought, Seong Jun.

45
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:40,902
You don't suit me.

46
00:04:43,443 --> 00:04:47,912
You asked me to see you as a person, not a title.

47
00:04:49,143 --> 00:04:51,052
That's my answer.

48
00:04:51,052 --> 00:04:55,553
I want to date a man who suits the position

49
00:04:55,553 --> 00:05:00,252
even without being Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's eldest grandson.

50
00:05:01,063 --> 00:05:05,592
Did you just reject me?

51
00:05:08,862 --> 00:05:11,803
Let's end it on a high note

52
00:05:11,803 --> 00:05:15,472
so we can smile if we meet again.

53
00:05:20,312 --> 00:05:23,583
You reject me and then say you'll see me again?

54
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:27,283
You're interesting to the very end.

55
00:05:31,193 --> 00:05:32,793
What?

56
00:05:34,623 --> 00:05:37,393
You'll "buy Soonyang"?

57
00:05:37,393 --> 00:05:39,332
With your money?

58
00:05:53,282 --> 00:05:56,713
Did getting your hands on over ten million dollars

59
00:05:56,713 --> 00:06:01,053
at a young age make you think lightly of money?

60
00:06:01,053 --> 00:06:06,552
Is Soonyang a large piece of candy you can get at a corner store to you?

61
00:06:07,323 --> 00:06:12,962
It's not because money is something to be taken lightly, nor because I don't take Soonyang seriously.

62
00:06:14,232 --> 00:06:18,403
You started as a delivery boy at a rice mill in Incheon

63
00:06:18,403 --> 00:06:22,042
and built up Soonyang Group which pays 200,000 employees.

64
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:29,212
I know better than anyone how much sweat and tears you shed on the way.

65
00:06:30,483 --> 00:06:36,752
One day, my eldest uncle will become chairman.

66
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:41,763
The eldest inherits everything, and that is our family's... No.

67
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:44,863
That's your rule.

68
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:48,663
You know that so well, so why?

69
00:06:52,803 --> 00:06:54,973
But Grandfather.

70
00:06:56,372 --> 00:07:02,013
Will Soonyang then be the same Soonyang it is now?

71
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:10,112
Just because he inherited your family name doesn't mean he inherited your entrepreneurship.

72
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:19,133
You're more concerned than anyone, Grandfather.

73
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:21,232
Unlike any other founder of a large company,

74
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:25,990
you haven't given Uncle anything. Isn't that the reason?

75
00:07:50,492 --> 00:07:52,862
Do you remember what I said?

76
00:07:52,862 --> 00:07:54,532
Anyone who goes against me,

77
00:07:54,532 --> 00:07:58,002
I never forgive, whether he be a sibling or a son.

78
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,050
Do you think a grandson is any different?

79
00:08:04,342 --> 00:08:06,312
Go back to studying law.

80
00:08:06,312 --> 00:08:11,453
I'm confiscating your pawn as of today so it doesn't get in your way.

81
00:08:11,453 --> 00:08:18,223
If Oh Se Hyeon doesn't egg you on, you'll grow out of this phase soon enough.

82
00:08:20,193 --> 00:08:23,523
Drop the charges and have him released, Grandfather.

83
00:08:28,502 --> 00:08:33,233
I'll sign over the business rights to New Seoul Town's 320,000m² housing complex

84
00:08:33,233 --> 00:08:36,043
to Soonyang Construction.

85
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:40,673
Do you think that's a valid deal?

86
00:08:41,413 --> 00:08:48,113
You study law at the best university in Korea, and yet you know so little about it.

87
00:08:49,622 --> 00:08:53,693
He was arrested for bribing the Mayor of Seoul.

88
00:08:54,592 --> 00:08:57,292
Chang Je will be replaced for taking the bribe,

89
00:08:57,292 --> 00:08:59,539
and Oh Se Hyeon will be locked up for giving it.

90
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,233
Then New Seoul Town as a whole will become Soonyang's.

91
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:07,873
If you ask me to release Oh Se Hyeon for just 320,000m²,

92
00:09:07,873 --> 00:09:10,503
would I accept the deal?

93
00:09:10,503 --> 00:09:17,512
I haven't even started bargaining, Grandfather.

94
00:09:17,512 --> 00:09:20,753
 Seoul Mayor Choi Chang Je's emergency press conference 

95
00:09:20,753 --> 00:09:22,782
will begin shortly.

96
00:09:22,782 --> 00:09:25,192
Please wait a little longer.

97
00:09:25,192 --> 00:09:27,223
What's the agenda for this press conference?

98
00:09:27,223 --> 00:09:30,132
Is it urgent enough to hold an unscheduled press conference?

99
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:33,233
- Is it about the mayor? 
 - Please tell us in advance.

100
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:35,903
- I have a question. 
 - What's it about?

101
00:09:35,903 --> 00:09:39,472
 The mayor will come down and announce it himself. 

102
00:09:44,512 --> 00:09:47,483
The agenda of the emergency press conference.

103
00:09:47,483 --> 00:09:50,283
You want to know, right, Manager Lee?

104
00:09:55,183 --> 00:09:58,092
The result of the prosecution's internal investigation came out,

105
00:09:58,092 --> 00:10:01,323
but there was a real estate speculation force using

106
00:10:01,323 --> 00:10:06,333
undisclosed internal data in the New Seoul Town District.

107
00:10:07,003 --> 00:10:14,263
   

108
00:10:14,263 --> 00:10:16,773
   

109
00:10:16,773 --> 00:10:18,573
   

110
00:10:20,012 --> 00:10:21,842
You see, the family members

111
00:10:21,842 --> 00:10:27,353
of Vice-Chairman Jin Young Ki's wife appeared on that list.

112
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:35,792
The mayor is involved in a corruption scandal.

113
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:38,662
What was that? Oh, the press conference.

114
00:10:38,662 --> 00:10:41,732
Let him hold one numerous time.

115
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:49,043
Do you think Chang Je has any power?

116
00:10:50,343 --> 00:10:54,343
If Miracle's majority shareholder, giving money to Mayor Choi,

117
00:10:54,343 --> 00:11:00,913
turns out to be Chairman Jin's youngest grandson, it's a different story.

118
00:11:02,853 --> 00:11:08,965
The daughter-in-law was immersed in land speculation, using private internal information.

119
00:11:08,965 --> 00:11:12,793
The youngest grandson committed a shameless act of bribing

120
00:11:12,793 --> 00:11:17,308
the son-in-law, the mayor of Seoul, to win a development project on that land.

121
00:11:17,308 --> 00:11:23,343
People will believe the mastermind was Soonyang Group's chairman, Jin Yang Cheol.

122
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:47,092
To the government that needs to revitalize real estate policies as an economic stimulus,

123
00:11:47,092 --> 00:11:50,163
Soonyang will become the guinea pig they'll punish.

124
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:56,402
You might never get another chance in Gangnam reconstruction projects,

125
00:11:56,402 --> 00:11:59,342
or other government-led construction projects.

126
00:12:02,683 --> 00:12:08,813
Are you still... going to indict CEO Oh for offering bribes?

127
00:12:21,563 --> 00:12:24,372
To deal with real estate speculators

128
00:12:24,372 --> 00:12:27,703
using undisclosed data, the Seoul Metropolitan Government

129
00:12:27,703 --> 00:12:31,142
excluded Soosaek District and chose Sangam District only

130
00:12:31,142 --> 00:12:34,142
as New Seoul Town's development district target.

131
00:12:34,142 --> 00:12:36,512
Are you not revealing the list of real estate speculators?

132
00:12:36,512 --> 00:12:39,282
Is it true a high-ranking society member was involved in it?

133
00:12:39,282 --> 00:12:41,652
- Please answer the question. 
 - We want a statement.

134
00:12:41,652 --> 00:12:45,693
I, Seoul Mayor Choi Chang Je, will promise you

135
00:12:45,693 --> 00:12:49,023
I will fulfill my responsibility

136
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,892
so the homeless common people

137
00:12:52,892 --> 00:12:57,362
no longer shed tears due to real estate speculators.

138
00:12:59,803 --> 00:13:02,073
Both investigations into Mayor Choi's bribery scandal

139
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:06,212
and the real estate speculation of the Vice-Chairman's wife's family

140
00:13:08,543 --> 00:13:11,113
were closed without charges.

141
00:13:19,852 --> 00:13:21,562
Tell me whom.

142
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:25,163
You see...

143
00:13:25,793 --> 00:13:28,003
My parents...

144
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,903
My family...

145
00:13:30,903 --> 00:13:36,573
Are you even lying to me?

146
00:13:36,573 --> 00:13:38,242
Father.

147
00:13:40,683 --> 00:13:42,642
"Your family"?

148
00:13:42,642 --> 00:13:44,713
Do you know what?

149
00:13:45,413 --> 00:13:49,852
Who do you think can make 300 million dollars in cash with just a phone call

150
00:13:49,852 --> 00:13:52,493
in Korea right now?

151
00:13:53,592 --> 00:13:54,493
Excuse me?

152
00:13:54,493 --> 00:13:57,733
Not me nor Daeyoung Group's Ju Yeong Il.

153
00:13:58,563 --> 00:14:02,333
The financer of Myeongdong's private loan market, Son Ho Chun.

154
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,332
Your father.

155
00:14:04,332 --> 00:14:06,133
My in-law.

156
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,102
The world is a nasty place, isn't it?

157
00:14:09,102 --> 00:14:12,712
Those who need urgent money suck up to your father.

158
00:14:12,712 --> 00:14:16,753
But behind his back, they point fingers at him for being a loan shark.

159
00:14:16,753 --> 00:14:20,582
Even so, there is one thing your father never does.

160
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,353
Do you know what that is?

161
00:14:23,523 --> 00:14:25,693
The only way he makes money is by lending money.

162
00:14:25,693 --> 00:14:29,162
He never looks elsewhere. Why?

163
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:34,903
Because that's the financer Son Ho Chun's honor and pride.

164
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,703
You're his daughter.

165
00:14:37,703 --> 00:14:40,903
Why do you know so little about him?

166
00:14:46,012 --> 00:14:47,543
Who was it?

167
00:14:47,543 --> 00:14:49,382
Who was it that egged you on

168
00:14:49,382 --> 00:14:53,790
to use your family names to speculate these lands? Tell me.

169
00:14:54,752 --> 00:14:56,983
Tell me who it was!

170
00:15:00,762 --> 00:15:03,463
   

171
00:15:14,242 --> 00:15:16,403
Grandfather is in the second-floor study, right?

172
00:15:16,403 --> 00:15:17,573
Why do you ask?

173
00:15:17,573 --> 00:15:18,843
I have something to tell him.

174
00:15:18,843 --> 00:15:20,812
Gosh, not now.

175
00:15:20,812 --> 00:15:23,782
I don't know what it's about but do it later.

176
00:15:23,782 --> 00:15:28,383
After telling your mother off, he summoned your father.

177
00:15:28,383 --> 00:15:31,723
If you get dragged in for no reason,

178
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:35,122
I will be too upset to do anything.

179
00:15:39,693 --> 00:15:42,332
It's all my fault, Father.

180
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:46,273
I had this burning desire

181
00:15:46,273 --> 00:15:49,203
to make up for the loss caused

182
00:15:49,203 --> 00:15:52,143
when acquiring Hando Steel and couldn't stop myself.

183
00:15:53,783 --> 00:15:56,542
Was that the only solution you could think of?

184
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,701
Don't you know what the world is like today?

185
00:16:02,553 --> 00:16:04,753
What are you? A pheasant's baby?

186
00:16:04,753 --> 00:16:08,492
Did you think nobody would know if you kept your head down?

187
00:16:16,873 --> 00:16:19,133
Enough. Get up now.

188
00:16:19,133 --> 00:16:23,702
A man shouldn't get down on his knees so quickly.

189
00:16:25,612 --> 00:16:27,412
Here.

190
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,022
 It might rain, Father. 

191
00:16:37,022 --> 00:16:39,092
You know, right?

192
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:42,492
That my knees are more accurate than the weather center.

193
00:16:43,662 --> 00:16:48,733
You should bundle up when you leave for work tomorrow.

194
00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:53,303
It will be tough on you for a while if your asthma relapses.

195
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:56,498
I'm here, Uncle.

196
00:16:56,498 --> 00:16:59,512
Gosh, my youngest nephew.

197
00:16:59,512 --> 00:17:03,282
I'm glad I listened to you and came up with a plan.

198
00:17:03,282 --> 00:17:07,253
But how did you think of it at such a young age?

199
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:11,852
Well, not everyone can become a majority shareholder of Miracle.

200
00:17:11,852 --> 00:17:15,662
It's just an investment as a way of studying.

201
00:17:15,662 --> 00:17:20,063
If you're interested in business, why not join Soonyang?

202
00:17:21,003 --> 00:17:22,742
You know my family situation.

203
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:25,902
Grandfather excluded me from the succession order.

204
00:17:25,902 --> 00:17:27,873
Really, he's an impossible man.

205
00:17:27,873 --> 00:17:31,642
Once he loses trust in someone, he never lets go of it.

206
00:17:33,213 --> 00:17:37,483
Geez. He'll try to drag me down throughout my term.

207
00:17:37,483 --> 00:17:38,813
   

208
00:17:38,813 --> 00:17:41,183
It worries me.

209
00:17:43,452 --> 00:17:49,452
Then... soar high enough that he can't drag you down.

210
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,092
Me, who doesn't even have a base in the party?

211
00:17:52,092 --> 00:17:54,263
How high can I go?

212
00:17:55,285 --> 00:18:00,373
To the highest point the support of the people can take you.

213
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:08,873
If 7,000 houses are supplied through the New Seoul Town project,

214
00:18:08,873 --> 00:18:11,357
it would be a great help to solve the real estate problem.

215
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:15,252
What's more, DMC Construction

216
00:18:15,252 --> 00:18:18,422
is the symbol of advanced technology and business.

217
00:18:18,422 --> 00:18:21,323
If the mayor of Seoul solves the problem of people's livelihoods

218
00:18:21,323 --> 00:18:23,922
and has a vision for the future,

219
00:18:25,263 --> 00:18:30,292
where else should he advance to... other than the Cheongwadae?

220
00:18:32,172 --> 00:18:33,802
Nephew.

221
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:38,243
New Seoul Town and DMC.

222
00:18:39,213 --> 00:18:41,743
Presidential candidate Choi Chang Je.

223
00:18:41,743 --> 00:18:45,213
It'll become your biggest achievement, Uncle.

224
00:18:53,053 --> 00:18:56,293
Mayor Choi Chang Je will become the president?

225
00:18:57,293 --> 00:19:00,692
Do you really think he'll become a presidential candidate?

226
00:19:01,803 --> 00:19:04,272
It's like I prescribed him a sedative.

227
00:19:04,272 --> 00:19:06,473
Mayor Choi.

228
00:19:06,473 --> 00:19:09,947
This was the first time he won against those he feared.

229
00:19:09,947 --> 00:19:13,113
His anxiety must be as great as his sense of achievement.

230
00:19:13,113 --> 00:19:16,783
I had to blind him with a greater ambition to get rid of that fear.

231
00:19:16,783 --> 00:19:22,553
We need to use him as our man until the completion of DMC.

232
00:19:26,452 --> 00:19:28,063
Here.

233
00:19:28,993 --> 00:19:32,662
Instead of tofu since you're from the US.

234
00:19:37,372 --> 00:19:39,373
Be honest with me.

235
00:19:39,373 --> 00:19:42,002
You're not 22, right?

236
00:19:43,342 --> 00:19:48,512
If I rip off that good-looking mask, maybe I'll find a 40-year-old man inside you.

237
00:19:48,512 --> 00:19:52,212
Or is this your second life?

238
00:19:53,352 --> 00:19:55,582
Tell me which one it is.

239
00:19:59,397 --> 00:20:02,863
You said partners must be honest with each other.

240
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:07,593
It's both of them.

241
00:20:11,303 --> 00:20:13,433
Stop bluffing.

242
00:20:13,433 --> 00:20:15,591
Forget it. You're in your twenties.

243
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:23,282
Why did you do it?

244
00:20:24,753 --> 00:20:29,553
- The land in Soosaek District... was my... 
 - Your grandfather...

245
00:20:30,993 --> 00:20:35,223
He will forgive me.

246
00:20:37,963 --> 00:20:41,403
But not you.

247
00:20:44,803 --> 00:20:48,242
Be very careful not to do anything

248
00:20:48,242 --> 00:20:52,243
that'll make you lose your grandfather's trust.

249
00:20:53,412 --> 00:20:56,582
You know what I mean, don't you?

250
00:21:00,382 --> 00:21:06,852
The only asset I have is you.

251
00:21:06,852 --> 00:21:12,063
The house and company are your grandfather's.

252
00:21:14,303 --> 00:21:19,202
The only thing your father has... is you.

253
00:21:22,543 --> 00:21:24,849
The eldest grandson of this family.

254
00:21:38,892 --> 00:21:41,252
It's raining, Seong Jun.

255
00:21:44,963 --> 00:21:48,362
The sky is so fickle.

256
00:21:51,172 --> 00:21:53,873
It's so hard to please.

257
00:21:58,142 --> 00:21:59,973
My sin...

258
00:22:03,642 --> 00:22:05,313
runs deep.

259
00:22:10,352 --> 00:22:12,753
In this whole world,

260
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:20,233
is there any other father who made his son serve a prison sentence in his stead

261
00:22:24,433 --> 00:22:29,402
and turned him into a cripple?

262
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:39,413
If there is a sin, it is the fault of that time.

263
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:45,923
So long as the military regime was targeting Soonyang, someone had to take responsibility.

264
00:22:45,993 --> 00:22:48,022
You simply...

265
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:53,432
did your utmost best to protect the group,

266
00:22:54,263 --> 00:22:58,032
even offering up Soonyang Transportation.

267
00:23:05,073 --> 00:23:10,073
I will ensure word doesn't travel outside regarding Do Jun's matter.

268
00:23:11,152 --> 00:23:12,482
Why?

269
00:23:14,182 --> 00:23:18,722
Have I lost face even in your eyes, Hang Jae?

270
00:23:21,023 --> 00:23:24,862
   

271
00:23:30,402 --> 00:23:32,703
 Chairman Jin Yang Cheol... 

272
00:23:35,273 --> 00:23:39,342
 your children will never 

273
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:40,813
  succeed to Soonyang. 

274
00:23:40,813 --> 00:23:42,843
 Let me help you, Mother. 

275
00:23:42,843 --> 00:23:44,913
 I can finish it on my own in no time. 

276
00:23:44,913 --> 00:23:49,082
 I know what to do. Look. Snap. Like that. 

277
00:23:50,483 --> 00:23:54,053
 Thanks to your great familial love, 

278
00:23:55,993 --> 00:23:59,363
 I lost my beloved family. 

279
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:08,132
 Now, 

280
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:14,343
 I have become incapable of returning to my family. 

281
00:24:18,753 --> 00:24:20,592
 I will never allow... 

282
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:26,283
 your children to share Soonyang happily and at peace. 

283
00:24:28,622 --> 00:24:30,792
 This is the real reason 

284
00:24:31,692 --> 00:24:34,193
 I'm trying to buy Soonyang. 

285
00:24:38,702 --> 00:24:42,602
   

286
00:24:44,642 --> 00:24:47,813
If you don't have any plans in the afternoon,

287
00:24:47,813 --> 00:24:51,313
I'll arrange some tests for you since you've come all the way here.

288
00:24:51,313 --> 00:24:53,213
Why?

289
00:24:53,213 --> 00:24:56,223
Did you purchase a new piece of expensive equipment?

290
00:24:56,223 --> 00:24:57,422
Excuse me?

291
00:24:57,422 --> 00:24:58,723
- Mr. Lee. 
 - Yes?

292
00:24:58,723 --> 00:25:01,463
Give Director Jung a bonus.

293
00:25:01,463 --> 00:25:04,323
Gosh. You're good at business.

294
00:25:04,323 --> 00:25:07,062
And with a rich old man to boot.

295
00:25:09,162 --> 00:25:13,302
In that case, please give me an envelope full of cash.

296
00:25:14,672 --> 00:25:18,143
But I'm not here as the head of the group today,

297
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:20,173
and not as a patient, either.

298
00:25:22,682 --> 00:25:25,282
I came as a guardian.

299
00:25:32,553 --> 00:25:35,353
He's so weak.

300
00:25:35,353 --> 00:25:40,063
Will he be able to act as a proper chairman after I die?

301
00:25:40,063 --> 00:25:42,433
I'm worried.

302
00:25:43,803 --> 00:25:45,773
From what you see,

303
00:25:46,733 --> 00:25:51,002
is Vice-Chairman Jin the son who resembles you the most?

304
00:25:52,412 --> 00:25:56,221
I thought you would hand over your position to the son

305
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,583
who took after you the most in the end.

306
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:02,952
Are you going to stick to primogeniture until the end?

307
00:26:02,952 --> 00:26:04,983
Who is it?

308
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:08,423
The one who resembles me.

309
00:26:15,003 --> 00:26:17,002
Is there even one who does?

310
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:22,702
Even if there is one, my children won't accept it.

311
00:26:24,513 --> 00:26:28,742
They will torment and fight each other

312
00:26:29,783 --> 00:26:32,013
until their last breath.

313
00:26:32,813 --> 00:26:35,752
Isn't that hell?

314
00:26:37,152 --> 00:26:40,823
Hell is for me to go to after my death,

315
00:26:42,263 --> 00:26:45,662
not for my living children.

316
00:26:51,073 --> 00:26:55,178
Oh, right. When is the meeting with the presidents of the subsidiary companies?

317
00:26:55,178 --> 00:26:58,043
It's at 3 p.m. Do you have something else to do?

318
00:26:58,043 --> 00:27:00,742
Yes, I do.

319
00:27:06,882 --> 00:27:11,923
Father. What brings you here?

320
00:27:12,993 --> 00:27:16,893
Why aren't you keeping your promise?

321
00:27:16,893 --> 00:27:18,493
Sorry?

322
00:27:20,392 --> 00:27:25,263
When you married someone I disapproved of,

323
00:27:25,263 --> 00:27:29,773
when you jumped into the movie industry instead of the family business.

324
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:33,342
Do you know remember what you told me?

325
00:27:33,342 --> 00:27:37,362
"I will live as a person who has nothing to do with Soonyang." That was my promise.

326
00:27:37,362 --> 00:27:39,815
Then why?

327
00:27:39,815 --> 00:27:41,720
Why?

328
00:27:43,553 --> 00:27:47,053
Why are you breaking it now?

329
00:27:47,793 --> 00:27:50,362
At least you know how shameless you are.

330
00:27:50,362 --> 00:27:53,693
You're using your son rather than involving yourself.

331
00:27:53,693 --> 00:27:57,202
What are you talking about, Father?

332
00:27:57,202 --> 00:28:00,232
Your son, Do Jin.

333
00:28:00,232 --> 00:28:04,343
He declared he was going to buy Soonyang.

334
00:28:04,343 --> 00:28:06,712
In front of me.

335
00:28:07,713 --> 00:28:10,542
- Manager Lee. 
 - Yes, Sir.

336
00:28:15,253 --> 00:28:16,895
   

337
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:19,192
These are the documents necessary for the ownership transfer of Soonyang Public Welfare Foundation

338
00:28:19,192 --> 00:28:23,610
connected to Soonyang Medical Center and HR Development Center.

339
00:28:24,462 --> 00:28:25,663
Father!

340
00:28:28,632 --> 00:28:30,802
What?

341
00:28:30,802 --> 00:28:32,702
Is that not enough?

342
00:28:37,273 --> 00:28:42,113
You barely know your own son, don't you?

343
00:28:43,382 --> 00:28:45,312
I'm scared.

344
00:28:45,882 --> 00:28:48,952
Scared that I might become a father like you.

345
00:28:52,452 --> 00:28:55,492
The one who abandoned me and left Soonyang...

346
00:28:57,662 --> 00:28:59,932
was you, Yoon Ki.

347
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:09,903
Don't send your son begging to me again.

348
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:30,092
You know, Do Jun made Father speechless.

349
00:29:35,102 --> 00:29:37,802
You should read this.

350
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,753
You have such poor political sense.

351
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:49,642
Are you sure you can even be re-elected?

352
00:29:49,642 --> 00:29:50,643
What?

353
00:29:50,643 --> 00:29:54,683
He gave Soonyang Public Welfare Foundation to Yoon Ki's family.

354
00:29:54,683 --> 00:29:56,923
Do you know what this means?

355
00:29:56,923 --> 00:30:00,953
That's for the medical center and HR Development Center.  It's not worth much.

356
00:30:00,953 --> 00:30:04,823
"This is all you can have from Soonyang, Yoon Ki."

357
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:07,539
He declared this.

358
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,432
My goodness.

359
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:14,032
Do Do Jun and Yoon Ki know about this hidden meaning?

360
00:30:14,602 --> 00:30:18,702
Do Jun is facing a dead-end.

361
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,320
I see.

362
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,742
It won't do you good to stay close to him.

363
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:29,253
Are you done eating? Gosh.

364
00:30:29,253 --> 00:30:31,153
Miss Hwa Young.

365
00:30:31,153 --> 00:30:33,823
You left behind your bag.

366
00:30:36,362 --> 00:30:41,371
I have social status and dignity to uphold now, so please carry this.

367
00:30:41,432 --> 00:30:44,702
What are your social status and dignity?

368
00:30:44,702 --> 00:30:46,972
Come on.

369
00:30:48,942 --> 00:30:51,373
Your husband who loves you.

370
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:57,924
That's right.

371
00:31:01,983 --> 00:31:04,582
Thank you for your hard work.

372
00:31:04,582 --> 00:31:06,452
Good job.

373
00:31:07,993 --> 00:31:12,263
Father gave the medical center and HR Development Center to Yoon Ki.

374
00:31:12,263 --> 00:31:14,263
Why did he do that?

375
00:31:14,263 --> 00:31:17,863
Why? Why all of a sudden?

376
00:31:17,902 --> 00:31:21,942
As soon as he secured enough money for the succession.

377
00:31:21,942 --> 00:31:24,392
This is...

378
00:31:26,202 --> 00:31:27,772
No.

379
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:33,538
It's a sign for him to start the succession.

380
00:31:33,538 --> 00:31:36,413
CEO Jin Yoon Ki isn't important.

381
00:31:36,413 --> 00:31:39,423
You should keep an eye on Junior Managing Director Jin Seong Jun.

382
00:31:40,122 --> 00:31:41,892
You're right.

383
00:31:41,892 --> 00:31:45,892
Since Chairman Jin is insistent on primogeniture.

384
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:58,768
- Are you sleeping? 
 - No, Grandfather.

385
00:31:58,768 --> 00:32:00,563
Please, come in.

386
00:32:07,153 --> 00:32:10,083
   

387
00:32:12,193 --> 00:32:14,693
   

388
00:32:14,693 --> 00:32:18,493
Someone told me... that if you want a rematch,

389
00:32:18,493 --> 00:32:21,563
you should know your opponent properly.

390
00:32:34,454 --> 00:32:41,923
Did losing the bidding of the New Seoul Town project make you very upset?

391
00:32:42,783 --> 00:32:45,992
I learned a lot.

392
00:32:45,992 --> 00:32:49,492
If the opponent wins, I become the loser.

393
00:32:49,492 --> 00:32:52,562
I realized that painfully on the field.

394
00:32:57,632 --> 00:32:59,502
My eldest grandson,

395
00:33:00,632 --> 00:33:07,002
do you want to get your revenge?

396
00:33:13,053 --> 00:33:15,752
Miracle Investment, Rachael speaking.

397
00:33:15,752 --> 00:33:19,292
Hello, CTV. Sorry?

398
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:23,658
For the 4.7 billion dollars that is needed for the construction  of New Seoul Town DMC,

399
00:33:23,658 --> 00:33:26,863
we'll cover the cost with project finance.

400
00:33:26,863 --> 00:33:27,832
For that...

401
00:33:27,832 --> 00:33:30,432
It must be important to prove the business value of DMC.

402
00:33:30,432 --> 00:33:32,233
That's right.

403
00:33:32,233 --> 00:33:35,747
If we seal the deal with cable channels, film studios,

404
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:39,284
and media-related academic organizations earlier on as planned,

405
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:41,653
the business value can be proved.

406
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:44,243
If the rate of return is twenty percent,

407
00:33:44,243 --> 00:33:47,483
we'll get 940 million dollars.

408
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:52,353
Miracle Investment can buy two percent of Soonyang Corporation's shares.

409
00:33:53,622 --> 00:33:55,462
Let me ask one thing.

410
00:33:55,462 --> 00:33:59,192
Why do you have to buy Soonyang?

411
00:33:59,192 --> 00:34:03,032
You can simply get in Chairman Jin's good graces and succeed to the company.

412
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,042
People are strange.

413
00:34:10,042 --> 00:34:15,573
They cannot stand the Kim family of North Korea succeeding to the power.

414
00:34:15,573 --> 00:34:19,083
But why do they think nothing of it when the grandchild of a chairman

415
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:21,713
succeeds to the management rights in South Korea?

416
00:34:21,713 --> 00:34:26,423
In the end, both did not prove that they were qualified.

417
00:34:26,423 --> 00:34:28,863
You speak as if it's not your business.

418
00:34:28,863 --> 00:34:32,122
Fellow Korean Lad, you're the grandchild of a chairman, too.

419
00:34:35,432 --> 00:34:36,963
We have a problem.

420
00:34:36,963 --> 00:34:39,732
The cable channels and film studios that were going to move into DMC called

421
00:34:39,733 --> 00:34:42,072
to say they will cancel the plan.

422
00:34:42,072 --> 00:34:45,172
CTV, HNet, KCN, and all the film studios.

423
00:34:45,172 --> 00:34:47,012
All of them at once?

424
00:34:47,012 --> 00:34:48,683
Wait.

425
00:34:48,683 --> 00:34:50,213
What's the reason?

426
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:54,683
A big advertiser demanded that they withdraw.

427
00:34:54,683 --> 00:34:59,923
Or else, they would stop all ads from their affiliates and even production support.

428
00:34:59,923 --> 00:35:01,952
An advertiser?

429
00:35:03,122 --> 00:35:07,223
If they're getting their affiliates involved, it means they're a big conglomerate.

430
00:35:12,872 --> 00:35:16,573
All cable channels and film studios that were planning to move into DMC decided

431
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:19,072
to retract the plan.

432
00:35:19,072 --> 00:35:21,718
I heard media-related academic organizations were going to move in as well.

433
00:35:21,718 --> 00:35:24,312
They are scholars who only study.

434
00:35:24,312 --> 00:35:26,113
How did you persuade them?

435
00:35:26,113 --> 00:35:28,383
I promised them industry-academic cooperation, research grants,

436
00:35:28,383 --> 00:35:31,583
and overseas training.

437
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:33,422
Okay.

438
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:38,593
Supporting academics is a way for a company to contribute to society as well.

439
00:35:38,633 --> 00:35:40,833
- I will remember that. 
 - Good.

440
00:35:41,503 --> 00:35:47,633
Goodness, DMC is going to end before they even start construction.

441
00:35:51,043 --> 00:35:52,713
What to do?

442
00:35:52,713 --> 00:35:56,813
It's your uncle's first business after he became the mayor.

443
00:35:57,443 --> 00:36:00,813
I'll meet him.

444
00:36:00,813 --> 00:36:03,353
- Will you? 
 - Yes.

445
00:36:03,383 --> 00:36:07,153
Families help each other when they're in trouble.

446
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:15,792
Seong Jun, how are things going with her?

447
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,543
The daughter of Hyunsung Daily's CEO.

448
00:36:21,543 --> 00:36:24,302
Why isn't there any news about your marriage?

449
00:36:25,773 --> 00:36:28,643
Do you guys not get along?

450
00:36:28,643 --> 00:36:30,583
No, Grandfather.

451
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:32,513
We're seeing each other well.

452
00:36:33,352 --> 00:36:34,582
Is that so?

453
00:36:34,582 --> 00:36:39,283
A man who manages his family well does business well too.

454
00:36:40,222 --> 00:36:42,663
My eldest grandson is all grown up.

455
00:36:44,262 --> 00:36:45,793
Okay.

456
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:56,147
What do you think, Hang Jae?

457
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:58,750
It will serve as a strong warning to Do Jun.

458
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,572
If the DMC project doesn't work out,

459
00:37:00,572 --> 00:37:03,583
Miracle Investment will suffer a heavy blow because they spent a lot on the initial investment.

460
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:05,983
I mean Seong Jun.

461
00:37:06,912 --> 00:37:08,882
My eldest grandson.

462
00:37:10,582 --> 00:37:13,553
He was better than the CEOs of the affiliates.

463
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:19,522
He catches on quickly to the hidden meaning of your words.

464
00:37:19,522 --> 00:37:22,103
Thank goodness...

465
00:37:23,733 --> 00:37:25,932
that Young Ki has

466
00:37:28,032 --> 00:37:30,942
a smart son like Seong Jun.

467
00:37:32,012 --> 00:37:34,172
- Really? 
 - Yes.

468
00:37:34,172 --> 00:37:37,583
Chairman Jin is taking Seong Jun with him?

469
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:40,752
According to the Secretary's Office, that is right.

470
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:45,253
Call Seong Jun's office.

471
00:37:45,253 --> 00:37:46,523
I should eat with him.

472
00:37:46,523 --> 00:37:48,763
Well...

473
00:37:49,523 --> 00:37:52,262
Wouldn't it be better for him to position himself

474
00:37:52,262 --> 00:37:56,962
as Chairman Jin's grandson rather than your son?

475
00:37:57,662 --> 00:38:00,173
"Chairman Jin started teaching his favorite grandson"

476
00:38:00,173 --> 00:38:02,843
"for him to succeed his place." This kind of an image.

477
00:38:02,843 --> 00:38:07,942
So I can't even call my son my son?

478
00:38:07,942 --> 00:38:11,243
I'm sorry. I acted out of line.

479
00:38:20,722 --> 00:38:23,023
Human Resource Department.

480
00:38:23,023 --> 00:38:25,622
Kim Ju Ryeon of Secretary's Office.

481
00:38:25,622 --> 00:38:28,462
Change his post right now.

482
00:38:30,403 --> 00:38:34,873
A deputy manager-level secretary dedicated to Vice-Chairman.

483
00:38:39,242 --> 00:38:41,013
Thank you, Sir!

484
00:38:41,013 --> 00:38:43,483
I'll pledge my allegiance to you.

485
00:38:43,483 --> 00:38:45,582
Is this really Korea?

486
00:38:45,582 --> 00:38:47,613
Not the Republic of Soonyang?

487
00:38:47,613 --> 00:38:50,953
How can they give up on moving into DMC with just one word from Soonyang?

488
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:55,292
Cable channels, film studios, and even academic organizations.

489
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:57,722
It's not one word. It's money.

490
00:38:57,722 --> 00:39:01,904
There are only 830,000 paid subscribers of cable channels.

491
00:39:01,904 --> 00:39:03,641
The advertising industry died out because of the IMF crisis.`

492
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:06,832
An advertiser like Soonyang is like their king.

493
00:39:06,832 --> 00:39:09,872
You need to listen to your king to be saved, right?

494
00:39:09,872 --> 00:39:13,972
Not to mention film studios, where Soonyang can interfere with investment and distribution.

495
00:39:13,972 --> 00:39:19,743
Soonyang's money is spread all around Korea like blood vessels.

496
00:39:19,743 --> 00:39:23,622
That's how Soonyang can move Korea.

497
00:39:23,622 --> 00:39:25,722
Why is high and mighty Soonyang interfering

498
00:39:25,722 --> 00:39:28,922
with a trivial matter like moving into DMC?

499
00:39:28,922 --> 00:39:34,863
He answered my declaration of war.

500
00:39:44,472 --> 00:39:46,513
It's Mayor Choi Chang Je.

501
00:39:53,253 --> 00:39:54,254
Hello.

502
00:39:54,254 --> 00:39:56,282
Is it true? 
    

503
00:39:56,282 --> 00:39:57,883
I heard all the broadcasting stations

504
00:39:57,883 --> 00:40:01,023
and media-related companies that were supposed to move into DMC

505
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,834
withdrew their plan.

506
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:08,592
Are you going to give up on DMC, the landmark of New Seoul Town?

507
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:12,677
The DMC project won't fall through.

508
00:40:12,677 --> 00:40:18,233
The Digital Media Center... is a future business that Miracle Investment is conducting confidently.

509
00:40:18,233 --> 00:40:22,951
We're planning to look for other broadcasting stations and media companies

510
00:40:22,951 --> 00:40:25,383
who wish to move in before the construction starts.

511
00:40:25,383 --> 00:40:28,923
Keep your word.

512
00:40:28,923 --> 00:40:33,352
I'll keep my word with Seoul's citizens.

513
00:40:33,352 --> 00:40:37,052
If there isn't any broadcasting station willing to move in before the construction starts,

514
00:40:37,063 --> 00:40:41,433
I'm going to hand over the DMC business to another company.

515
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:49,833
To a construction company bigger and more powerful than Miracle Investment.

516
00:40:51,972 --> 00:40:57,313
You're the one who taught me what the DMC project means

517
00:40:58,242 --> 00:41:01,382
to Choi Chang Je, the mayor of Seoul.

518
00:41:01,382 --> 00:41:05,553
Please do a good job. I'm hanging up.

519
00:41:06,892 --> 00:41:08,792
What did Mayor Choi say?

520
00:41:11,693 --> 00:41:13,562
He let me know

521
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:18,262
why Soonyang interfered so much with the companies moving into DMC.

522
00:41:21,032 --> 00:41:23,242
Mayor Choi is planning

523
00:41:24,472 --> 00:41:27,813
to hand over the DMC project to Soonyang.

524
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:31,213
The New Seoul Town project

525
00:41:31,213 --> 00:41:34,613
comes back to the company it belongs to, Uncle.

526
00:41:34,613 --> 00:41:37,695
I should give you a boost

527
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:39,193
when I have the power.

528
00:41:39,193 --> 00:41:40,665
Once the DMC project becomes successful,

529
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:43,423
your position in the company will become more solid.

530
00:41:43,423 --> 00:41:46,593
"Jin Seong Jun didn't get the post just for being the Chairman's grandson."

531
00:41:46,593 --> 00:41:49,432
Let's show them. Yes?

532
00:41:52,903 --> 00:41:56,602
I understand why Grandfather was against it.

533
00:41:57,273 --> 00:42:00,472
I guess everyone becomes like this when they're drunk on power.

534
00:42:00,472 --> 00:42:01,912
What?

535
00:42:03,443 --> 00:42:06,482
You can't tell what situation you're in now, can you?

536
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:07,852
No.

537
00:42:08,682 --> 00:42:11,383
It's not you, but I

538
00:42:11,383 --> 00:42:13,423
and Soonyang

539
00:42:13,423 --> 00:42:17,363
that have your life in our hands, Mayor Choi Chang Je.

540
00:42:18,963 --> 00:42:20,593
Nephew.

541
00:42:20,593 --> 00:42:22,532
New Seoul Town project was dirtied

542
00:42:22,532 --> 00:42:26,002
with real estate speculation from the start.

543
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:30,443
Imagine the DMC project worth almost five billion dollars falling through.

544
00:42:30,443 --> 00:42:32,713
Won't you end up as a Seoul mayor who became a powerless figurehead

545
00:42:32,713 --> 00:42:35,713
as soon as your term started?

546
00:42:35,713 --> 00:42:37,242
I...

547
00:42:37,242 --> 00:42:41,653
Grandfather is giving you one more chance.

548
00:42:42,552 --> 00:42:44,782
Because you're his family.

549
00:42:52,262 --> 00:42:56,333
If you need the power of Soonyang, don't hesitate to ask.

550
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:58,762
Come to Jeongsimjae to ask.

551
00:43:00,133 --> 00:43:02,102
As you always did.

552
00:43:14,153 --> 00:43:17,983
 You'll buy Soonyang? With your money? 

553
00:43:18,952 --> 00:43:22,352
 Do you think you will be able to buy it with money? 

554
00:43:23,622 --> 00:43:25,823
 Try it then. 

555
00:43:26,793 --> 00:43:30,133
 But pay a lot for it. 

556
00:43:34,432 --> 00:43:37,943
You're drinking? You should be.

557
00:43:38,773 --> 00:43:43,512
You're about to lose two percent of Soonyang Corporation's shares.

558
00:43:43,512 --> 00:43:46,113
But don't drink so much yet.

559
00:43:46,113 --> 00:43:49,653
You'll want to drink more after listening to this.

560
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:52,593
Looking for companies that can move into DMC is

561
00:43:52,593 --> 00:43:54,992
rather simple, actually.

562
00:43:54,992 --> 00:43:56,322
We just need to look for broadcasting stations

563
00:43:56,322 --> 00:44:00,162
that can be financially independent without Soonyang's ads.

564
00:44:00,162 --> 00:44:01,463
And what's that station?

565
00:44:01,463 --> 00:44:03,333
There's none.

566
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:05,763
Seriously...

567
00:44:05,763 --> 00:44:08,133
Stations that have enough influence to move into DMC

568
00:44:08,133 --> 00:44:10,943
are all managed by Soonyang.

569
00:44:10,943 --> 00:44:13,373
It got me thinking...

570
00:44:13,373 --> 00:44:17,813
that Digital Media City, your ambitious work,

571
00:44:18,813 --> 00:44:22,182
might be too early for Korea as of now.

572
00:44:22,182 --> 00:44:23,961
What do you mean?

573
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:27,093
I promised to be honest as a partner, so I'll tell you.

574
00:44:27,093 --> 00:44:29,492
Before deciding on what to invest,

575
00:44:29,492 --> 00:44:32,770
I always look at this cheat sheet.

576
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,293
A cheat sheet?

577
00:44:34,293 --> 00:44:36,532
I don't mean complex figures with difficult names

578
00:44:36,532 --> 00:44:38,262
like the stock market index, economic growth rate,

579
00:44:38,262 --> 00:44:39,403
and current account balance.

580
00:44:39,403 --> 00:44:43,043
I look at the real economic index that can be seen at once.

581
00:44:55,983 --> 00:44:59,182
- What is that? 
 - Signboards.

582
00:45:01,552 --> 00:45:04,523
Signboards are your cheat sheets?

583
00:45:04,523 --> 00:45:06,133
You can see everything from signboards.

584
00:45:06,133 --> 00:45:07,793
The flow of market, consumers' needs,

585
00:45:07,793 --> 00:45:10,032
and the outlook of an industry.

586
00:45:10,032 --> 00:45:12,980
So signboards, no...

587
00:45:13,672 --> 00:45:17,615
So what does today's cheat sheet say?

588
00:45:17,615 --> 00:45:18,872
Look.

589
00:45:18,872 --> 00:45:21,219
All the new signboards on the streets

590
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:23,813
are for internet cafes.

591
00:45:23,813 --> 00:45:25,113
Does this make sense?

592
00:45:25,113 --> 00:45:27,282
Is this truly a country that wants to become an IT powerhouse?

593
00:45:27,282 --> 00:45:30,995
I've never seen an internet cafe in New York, not once.

594
00:45:30,995 --> 00:45:32,523
Things have advanced so much,

595
00:45:32,523 --> 00:45:33,753
so why do people still not have a computer at home

596
00:45:33,753 --> 00:45:36,063
that they need to go to internet cafes?

597
00:45:36,063 --> 00:45:37,963
This is why

598
00:45:37,963 --> 00:45:42,293
the Digital Media City won't happen.

599
00:45:52,273 --> 00:45:53,513
   

600
00:45:53,513 --> 00:45:57,783
 There's nobody to defend it now. 

601
00:45:59,613 --> 00:46:00,613
   

602
00:46:00,613 --> 00:46:01,614
   

603
00:46:01,614 --> 00:46:02,722
   

604
00:46:10,322 --> 00:46:13,233
Your cheat sheet is correct, Mr. Oh.

605
00:46:15,903 --> 00:46:20,073
You can run a broadcasting station without Soonyang's ads.

606
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:25,372
It might even gain enough influence to move into DMC.

607
00:46:25,372 --> 00:46:27,643
Is there such a station?

608
00:46:27,643 --> 00:46:29,613
Where?

609
00:46:31,543 --> 00:46:33,282
   

610
00:46:33,282 --> 00:46:36,427
Is E-sports even possible?

611
00:46:36,427 --> 00:46:39,852
Game companies weren't interested in the online game relay broadcasting

612
00:46:39,852 --> 00:46:42,593
that we suggested.

613
00:46:43,262 --> 00:46:45,262
Gosh.

614
00:46:45,262 --> 00:46:49,133
But maybe because their target audience matches,

615
00:46:49,133 --> 00:46:52,702
a cartoon broadcasting station is showing interest.

616
00:46:52,702 --> 00:46:56,003
And they will actively accommodate our suggestion to minimize

617
00:46:56,003 --> 00:46:58,015
the profit from ads and earn

618
00:46:58,015 --> 00:46:59,642
from gamers' subscription fees and relay rights instead.

619
00:46:59,642 --> 00:47:02,813
- I see. 
 - Okay.

620
00:47:04,088 --> 00:47:07,191
Right, one more thing. They have a condition.

621
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:11,023
Regarding the move into DMC... Miracle's D double-J.

622
00:47:11,023 --> 00:47:13,752
They want to discuss with you, the majority shareholder.

623
00:47:13,752 --> 00:47:16,662
- The majority shareholder? 
 - Yes.

624
00:47:29,302 --> 00:47:32,972
   

625
00:48:10,043 --> 00:48:14,513
Miracle Investment's majority shareholder, Jin Do Jun.

626
00:48:16,822 --> 00:48:19,330
What's going on?

627
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:23,493
I'm here to meet the representative of a game company who will move into DMC.

628
00:48:23,493 --> 00:48:25,923
I'm that representative.

629
00:48:28,563 --> 00:48:33,033
My uncle has a broadcasting station that mainly airs animations.

630
00:48:33,033 --> 00:48:35,702
I heard Miracle Investment was looking for a gaming channel,

631
00:48:35,702 --> 00:48:38,003
so I asked him a favor.

632
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,412
Reorganization and composition of staff.

633
00:48:43,412 --> 00:48:45,212
They're all completed.

634
00:48:46,613 --> 00:48:49,653
I'm qualified enough to be here, right?

635
00:49:05,403 --> 00:49:08,032
Do you take after your mother?

636
00:49:09,503 --> 00:49:12,073
You were pretty talented in acting.

637
00:49:13,343 --> 00:49:16,583
You said you weren't interested in succeeding Soonyang.

638
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:18,642
But you're standing in front of me

639
00:49:18,642 --> 00:49:20,952
as the majority shareholder of Miracle Investment.

640
00:49:23,753 --> 00:49:25,752
How did you find out?

641
00:49:26,622 --> 00:49:28,593
I told you.

642
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:32,102
Hyunsung Daily is good at getting information.

643
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:33,904
Think about it.

644
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:35,932
The power to move public opinion.

645
00:49:35,932 --> 00:49:38,832
Chairman Jin would want a lot more than that

646
00:49:38,832 --> 00:49:41,102
to join hands with my family.

647
00:49:42,072 --> 00:49:44,173
I'm not the one

648
00:49:44,173 --> 00:49:46,503
he wants to marry off to you.

649
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:55,593
We're getting ready to start broadcasting channels

650
00:49:55,593 --> 00:49:57,561
for Hyunsung Daily's financial and sports magazines.

651
00:49:57,561 --> 00:49:59,763
I already have my father's permission.

652
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:03,634
First, we'll move Hyunsung Daily's HQ to DMC.

653
00:50:03,634 --> 00:50:05,563
Then we'll get ready

654
00:50:05,563 --> 00:50:07,671
to open the channels at DMC.

655
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:11,503
Then Miracle won't have any problems with the construction

656
00:50:11,503 --> 00:50:13,602
and parceling out of DMC.

657
00:50:13,602 --> 00:50:16,233
Four channels

658
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:19,443
and Hyunsung Daily too?

659
00:50:23,412 --> 00:50:25,283
Now, do you understand

660
00:50:25,952 --> 00:50:30,622
why you really need me?

661
00:50:32,083 --> 00:50:33,093
What do you say?

662
00:50:33,093 --> 00:50:36,892
I'd say it's an offer you can't refuse.

663
00:51:02,322 --> 00:51:04,483
It truly is an offer

664
00:51:05,253 --> 00:51:06,853
I can't refuse.

665
00:51:11,893 --> 00:51:14,093
   

666
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:35,012
What would you like to order, Sir?

667
00:52:35,012 --> 00:52:36,543
Well.

668
00:52:37,958 --> 00:52:42,883
Vienna coffee, without cinnamon.

669
00:52:42,883 --> 00:52:47,023
That's what Min Yeong always prepared for you, right?

670
00:52:48,432 --> 00:52:51,999
Is she not here today? I don't see her.

671
00:52:51,999 --> 00:52:53,837
Oh, I guess you didn't know.

672
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:57,202
Min Yeong quit to start studying for the bar exam.

673
00:52:57,202 --> 00:53:00,403
She said everyone in her family passed the bar while in school.

674
00:53:01,472 --> 00:53:03,172
Really?

675
00:53:05,372 --> 00:53:07,212
All right, then.

676
00:53:16,552 --> 00:53:18,322
Here.

677
00:53:19,622 --> 00:53:23,322
Oh, you can use it next time.

678
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:30,903
There will be no next time.

679
00:53:49,222 --> 00:53:51,883
What would you like...

680
00:53:55,963 --> 00:53:59,392
Oh, do you work here part-time?

681
00:54:00,063 --> 00:54:01,262
As someone once told me,

682
00:54:01,262 --> 00:54:05,763
I don't want to take my privileges for granted anymore... Sir.

683
00:54:08,646 --> 00:54:11,542
I thought about it, and you weren't entirely wrong.

684
00:54:11,542 --> 00:54:16,143
I'm glad I learned the lesson before beginning a law career.

685
00:54:16,143 --> 00:54:20,213
And for that, I'm grateful.

686
00:54:22,722 --> 00:54:27,193
My gosh. You seem quite touched by what I said, Sir.

687
00:54:28,523 --> 00:54:29,923
Your name tag is upside down.

688
00:54:29,923 --> 00:54:31,923
   

689
00:54:33,963 --> 00:54:36,632
Vienna coffee, please.

690
00:54:39,032 --> 00:54:40,472
How much is it? 1,200 won? ($1.20)

691
00:54:40,472 --> 00:54:42,443
It's 1,200 won.

692
00:54:42,443 --> 00:54:44,342
Without cinnamon, please.

693
00:54:44,342 --> 00:54:45,943
You owe me 800 won  (80 cents) .

694
00:54:45,943 --> 00:54:47,513
Yes.

695
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:16,550
♫   I am living in my memories again   ♫

696
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:23,550
♫   Because I miss you   ♫

697
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:32,370
♫   As I want you and love you   ♫

698
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:38,680
♫   That's how I am stuck here   ♫

699
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:45,512
Hello.

700
00:55:45,512 --> 00:55:47,477
I used to work here.

701
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:49,203
Here's the key to the supply storage room.

702
00:55:49,203 --> 00:55:52,416
- I forgot to return it. 
 - I see.

703
00:55:52,416 --> 00:55:55,243
Oh, he was here a few moments ago.

704
00:55:55,243 --> 00:55:57,713
Why didn't you tell him that you quit?

705
00:55:57,713 --> 00:55:59,582
He came all the way here for nothing.

706
00:55:59,582 --> 00:56:01,892
Whom? Who was here?

707
00:56:01,892 --> 00:56:04,361
You know, the guy who always gets Vienna coffee.

708
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,392
When I told him you quit,

709
00:56:06,392 --> 00:56:08,950
he looked like he'd just gotten dumped or something.

710
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:16,230
♫   I guess I still can't forget you   ♫

711
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:23,550
♫   I'm waiting for you like a fool   ♫

712
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:30,080
♫   Please remember me, my different faces   ♫

713
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:33,390
♫   I won't let go  ♫

714
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:38,600
♫   Of a love we both wanted like this   ♫

715
00:56:46,432 --> 00:56:51,133
It truly is an offer I can't refuse.

716
00:57:05,812 --> 00:57:08,882
So what should I offer?

717
00:57:08,882 --> 00:57:11,722
For every deal, there's a price to pay.

718
00:57:18,492 --> 00:57:20,332
You know this too.

719
00:57:21,193 --> 00:57:25,562
We'll be good partners.

720
00:57:30,142 --> 00:57:32,372
"Good partners?"

721
00:57:35,772 --> 00:57:38,342
So in a nutshell,

722
00:57:39,042 --> 00:57:43,283
you want me to do as you say, let you keep me on a leash,

723
00:57:43,283 --> 00:57:45,582
and obey your family's advice at all times

724
00:57:45,582 --> 00:57:48,752
just so you can

725
00:57:48,752 --> 00:57:52,762
become the granddaughter-in-law of the Soonyang family,

726
00:57:55,963 --> 00:58:00,063
while knowing that I'm being tailed and watched by people you hired.

727
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:02,903
- That's... 
 - To me,

728
00:58:03,642 --> 00:58:06,742
it sounds like you want to own me before you own Soonyang.

729
00:58:11,343 --> 00:58:14,613
I'm afraid I must refuse your offer, Ms. Mo Hyeon Min.

730
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:20,153
I have no interest in living as your puppet.

731
00:58:52,822 --> 00:58:53,723
   

732
00:58:53,723 --> 00:58:58,193
 I'm waiting for the day we can meet again. 

733
00:58:58,193 --> 00:59:00,063
 From Jin Seong Jun. 

734
00:59:03,262 --> 00:59:06,403
I didn't know I'd see it again so soon.

735
00:59:06,403 --> 00:59:09,172
Your smile, Ms. Mo Hyeon Min.

736
00:59:10,243 --> 00:59:13,972
We promised to meet again with smiles on our faces.

737
00:59:19,443 --> 00:59:23,512
Today is that day, right?

738
00:59:25,452 --> 00:59:27,923
Oh, yes!

739
00:59:27,923 --> 00:59:29,863
 Men's premium underwear! 

740
00:59:29,863 --> 00:59:31,705
 A five-piece trunk set is... 

741
00:59:31,705 --> 00:59:33,434
Hyung.

742
00:59:33,434 --> 00:59:36,002
I was wondering what you were watching. A home-shopping channel?

743
00:59:36,002 --> 00:59:38,103
Do not let your guard down.

744
00:59:38,103 --> 00:59:39,004
You startled me.

745
00:59:39,004 --> 00:59:40,711
It'll sell out the moment you let your guard down.

746
00:59:40,711 --> 00:59:43,943
A spectacular action-thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat.

747
00:59:43,943 --> 00:59:45,802
Coming to theaters this summer.

748
00:59:45,802 --> 00:59:48,642
It'll surpass your imagination in every possible way.

749
00:59:48,642 --> 00:59:50,682
A fantastic adventure movie.

750
00:59:50,682 --> 00:59:53,612
"Home Shopping."

751
00:59:54,658 --> 00:59:59,053
Hyeong Jun only watches shopping channels these days.

752
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:01,264
Hey, you don't need a lot of stuff.

753
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:05,202
Hey, shopping isn't about buying things you need.

754
01:00:05,202 --> 01:00:07,693
It's all about buying things you want.

755
01:00:07,693 --> 01:00:10,933
Do you understand, my little brother?

756
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:15,472
- Do Jun. 
 - Yes.

757
01:00:15,472 --> 01:00:20,372
Your father wants to speak to you about something.

758
01:00:27,682 --> 01:00:30,153
 Your grandfather was here. 

759
01:00:36,722 --> 01:00:39,263
Soonyang Public Welfare Foundation at Soonyang Medical Center

760
01:00:39,263 --> 01:00:41,733
and HR Development Center.

761
01:00:41,733 --> 01:00:44,503
Your grandfather handed it over to us.

762
01:00:47,373 --> 01:00:49,973
   

763
01:00:51,772 --> 01:00:54,012
It's a warning.

764
01:00:54,012 --> 01:01:00,413
Your grandfather is warning us not to get greedy over Soonyang.

765
01:01:00,413 --> 01:01:04,358
- Father... 
 - I heard everything.

766
01:01:07,253 --> 01:01:11,222
I'm sorry I couldn't give you a heads-up.

767
01:01:11,222 --> 01:01:16,393
Must you go against your grandfather's wishes?

768
01:01:21,832 --> 01:01:24,643
I understand why you're worried.

769
01:01:24,643 --> 01:01:30,543
You know better than anyone how scary Grandfather can be.

770
01:01:32,043 --> 01:01:34,583
I understand that you're against it.

771
01:01:34,583 --> 01:01:36,782
Let's do it.

772
01:01:36,782 --> 01:01:38,752
I looked into it.

773
01:01:38,752 --> 01:01:44,652
I think I can afford to acquire a cable movie channel for DMC.

774
01:01:44,652 --> 01:01:47,393
Although it won't be of much help.

775
01:01:47,393 --> 01:01:54,062
Always remember that I have your back, Do Jun.

776
01:01:59,142 --> 01:02:04,043
Honey, did you decide to give in and let Do Jun have his way?

777
01:02:04,043 --> 01:02:06,612
Honey, it's...

778
01:02:06,612 --> 01:02:10,883
You two. Promise me.

779
01:02:10,883 --> 01:02:14,252
Do Jun, promise me that you'll never

780
01:02:14,252 --> 01:02:17,593
become like everyone else on your father's side of the family.

781
01:02:17,593 --> 01:02:22,392
And you, promise me that you'll protect Do Jun.

782
01:02:22,392 --> 01:02:28,363
So your father and siblings can't hurt our son again.

783
01:02:56,173 --> 01:02:59,363
The fourth son of Chairman Jin Yang Cheol, 4-0.

784
01:02:59,363 --> 01:03:02,302
His wife, 4-alpha.

785
01:03:04,503 --> 01:03:06,272
And me,

786
01:03:07,043 --> 01:03:09,142
Jin Do Jun.

787
01:03:10,583 --> 01:03:13,443
They're my mother and father,.

788
01:03:24,793 --> 01:03:27,932
   

789
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:31,341
I should get a wedding gift for my eldest grandson.

790
01:03:31,341 --> 01:03:32,876
Is there anything you need?

791
01:03:32,876 --> 01:03:36,442
We'll start out at Jeongsimjae, so we don't need anything.

792
01:03:36,442 --> 01:03:38,343
No, don't say that.

793
01:03:38,343 --> 01:03:41,343
You are becoming a real adult, Seong Jun.

794
01:03:41,343 --> 01:03:44,512
I must do something for you.

795
01:03:44,512 --> 01:03:46,942
Tell me what you want.

796
01:03:46,942 --> 01:03:49,183
Then Grandfather,

797
01:03:49,183 --> 01:03:55,783
please give me the right to play a part as one of the adults in the family.

798
01:03:56,599 --> 01:03:59,193
As one of the adults in the family? It's no big deal.

799
01:03:59,193 --> 01:04:01,762
It's about taking responsibility.

800
01:04:01,762 --> 01:04:05,432
If Seong Jun wishes to share the burden with us,

801
01:04:05,432 --> 01:04:08,633
he should get some shares too. Right, Dong Ki?

802
01:04:08,633 --> 01:04:12,202
Yes, sure thing.

803
01:04:12,202 --> 01:04:15,673
So? Did Father say he'd give him some?

804
01:04:15,673 --> 01:04:17,282
Of course.

805
01:04:17,282 --> 01:04:23,513
I think he wants to announce it at the reception when the whole family is there.

806
01:04:24,352 --> 01:04:25,528
Hwa Young.

807
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:30,363
Have a drink with me at the reception. It's been too long.

808
01:04:30,363 --> 01:04:34,033
Sounds like it'll be a coronation ceremony, not a wedding.

809
01:04:34,963 --> 01:04:37,163
Will Father really announce

810
01:04:37,163 --> 01:04:41,414
at the wedding that Seong Jun is next in line for the throne?

811
01:04:44,302 --> 01:04:47,613
Of course, Seong Jun is his eldest grandson.

812
01:04:47,613 --> 01:04:51,042
Your father will take great care of him.

813
01:04:51,042 --> 01:04:54,113
All right. Don't be late.

814
01:04:54,113 --> 01:04:56,883
I'll see you at the wedding.

815
01:04:59,095 --> 01:05:01,093
About Seong Jun's fiancee.

816
01:05:01,093 --> 01:05:03,122
I should ask her to visit us tomorrow.

817
01:05:03,122 --> 01:05:07,533
Why? Do you already want to be an overbearing mother-in-law?

818
01:05:08,233 --> 01:05:11,803
No, I want to be a good daughter-in-law to you.

819
01:05:11,803 --> 01:05:16,733
All your paintings are too good to be just kept in this room.

820
01:05:16,733 --> 01:05:18,403
You should have a solo show.

821
01:05:18,403 --> 01:05:20,173
Your granddaughter-in-law runs a gallery.

822
01:05:20,173 --> 01:05:23,486
Gosh, stop. A solo show? Please.

823
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:25,655
This is just an old lady's hobby.

824
01:05:25,655 --> 01:05:29,159
Don't be so modest. You should think about it, Mother.

825
01:05:29,159 --> 01:05:32,362
Jeong Rae, has Mr. Yang called?

826
01:05:32,362 --> 01:05:35,899
He said he'd be home by lunch. How come he's not back yet?

827
01:05:35,899 --> 01:05:37,363
Oh, you're right.

828
01:05:37,363 --> 01:05:40,523
Father always calls if he's going to be home late.

829
01:05:55,772 --> 01:05:56,943
I received a call from Jeongsimjae.

830
01:05:56,943 --> 01:06:00,083
They're asking when the chairman will be home.

831
01:06:00,083 --> 01:06:02,782
What should I tell them, Sir?

832
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:19,132
 We found a brain arteriovenous malformation, Sir. 

833
01:06:20,403 --> 01:06:23,172
 Will surgery fix it? 

834
01:06:23,172 --> 01:06:25,873
 The thing is... 

835
01:06:25,873 --> 01:06:31,013
 The location is quite risky if we were to perform surgery. 

836
01:06:31,013 --> 01:06:38,513
 So I have no choice but to rely on luck. 

837
01:06:41,693 --> 01:06:43,622
 Is that it? 

838
01:06:44,463 --> 01:06:48,593
 We will do our very best to monitor it closely. 

839
01:06:50,003 --> 01:06:52,833
In my head,

840
01:06:54,173 --> 01:07:00,603
there is a ticking time bomb waiting to go off.

841
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:57,000
   

842
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:04,470
♫   It seems I still can't let you go, 
 like a fool, I'm missing you   ♫

843
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:10,840
♫   Please remember, the other side of me   ♫

844
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:14,070
♫   I won't let go of   ♫

845
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:19,610
♫   A love we both wanted just like this   ♫

846
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:23,560
♫   We loved each other   ♫

847
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:28,863
 As you ordered, I prepared a share transfer agreement for Mr. Jin Seong Jun. 

848
01:08:28,863 --> 01:08:30,302
 Chairman! 

849
01:08:30,302 --> 01:08:31,541
   

850
01:08:31,541 --> 01:08:36,211
 Don't you know whom I love the most out of all my children? 

851
01:08:36,211 --> 01:08:38,243
 What on earth did you do? 

852
01:08:38,243 --> 01:08:43,436
 The one who can make Soonyang bigger and better than I can will get everything. 

853
01:08:43,436 --> 01:08:46,282
 That Do Jun takes after me. 

854
01:08:46,282 --> 01:08:49,383
 Do you think that makes sense? 

855
01:08:49,383 --> 01:08:51,783
 Grandfather, you were right. 

856
01:08:51,783 --> 01:08:54,697
 I've given up on my goal of buying Soonyang with my money. 

857
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:56,222
 Do not step over the line! 

858
01:08:56,222 --> 01:09:01,133
 You guys are different from us. 

859
01:09:01,938 --> 01:09:06,940
 Don't you dare delude yourself into thinking that you can be a rightful heir. 

860
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:15,000
