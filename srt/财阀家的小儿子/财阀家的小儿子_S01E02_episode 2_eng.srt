1
00:00:04,491 --> 00:00:06,792
The Chairman is here.

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:14,960


3
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:21,242
Welcome.

4
00:00:21,242 --> 00:00:23,812
Congratulations, Sir.

5
00:00:23,812 --> 00:00:27,622
- Congratulations. 
 - Congratulations.

6
00:00:28,952 --> 00:00:30,321
Congratulations.

7
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:33,652
- Congratulations. 
 - Hello.

8
00:00:33,652 --> 00:00:36,141
 Congratulations, Sir. 

9
00:00:57,382 --> 00:01:00,751
 The founder of Soonyang. 

10
00:01:01,551 --> 00:01:05,051
 It's him. Chairman Jin Yang Cheol. 

11
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:10,092
 This is a dream. It can't be reality. 

12
00:01:12,932 --> 00:01:15,661
 He died twenty years ago. 

13
00:01:22,072 --> 00:01:24,071
 How could this be? 

14
00:01:38,452 --> 00:01:40,191
Do Jun.

15
00:01:41,121 --> 00:01:43,261
Forgive me, Father.

16
00:01:56,741 --> 00:02:01,381
Do Jun, you should watch your manners when you're around Grandfather.

17
00:02:01,381 --> 00:02:05,151
He's young. It happens when you're overwhelmed.

18
00:02:05,151 --> 00:02:08,621
I'll watch Do Jun. You can go on ahead.

19
00:02:08,621 --> 00:02:10,192
Okay, then.

20
00:02:10,192 --> 00:02:12,491
You sweet boy.

21
00:02:15,591 --> 00:02:18,491
That's what your grandfather is like.

22
00:02:18,491 --> 00:02:21,562
Nothing about his life is fun.

23
00:02:21,562 --> 00:02:24,572
Would thorns break out of his hand

24
00:02:24,572 --> 00:02:27,942
if he were to just stroke your head?

25
00:02:27,942 --> 00:02:32,711
Do Jun, come with Grandma.

26
00:02:32,711 --> 00:02:36,611
- "Grandma"? 
 - Yes, Sweetie.

27
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:40,781
Who...

28
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:43,782
Who am I?

29
00:02:43,782 --> 00:02:45,122
You're so silly.

30
00:02:45,122 --> 00:02:49,262
What do you mean, who are you? You are Jin Do Jun,

31
00:02:49,262 --> 00:02:52,212
the youngest grandchild of the Soonyang family.

32
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:02,922
   

33
00:03:04,141 --> 00:03:09,041
Is it the year 1987?

34
00:03:10,352 --> 00:03:15,152
Am I a member of Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's family?

35
00:03:15,152 --> 00:03:17,382
The youngest?

36
00:03:17,382 --> 00:03:19,291
This can't be.

37
00:03:21,062 --> 00:03:23,121
   

38
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:27,401
   

39
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:29,932
   

40
00:03:32,901 --> 00:03:36,542
Hyeong Jun, Do Jun, it's your first visit, isn't it?

41
00:03:37,872 --> 00:03:39,641
This is Grandpa's place.

42
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:42,742
Whoa. Is this the main entrance?

43
00:03:42,742 --> 00:03:44,052
It's massive.

44
00:03:44,052 --> 00:03:46,112
 It's just the same. 

45
00:03:46,112 --> 00:03:50,981
 Jeongsimjae, the Soonyang residence that had been theirs for generations. 

46
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:53,662
 A monk well-versed in geomancy 

47
00:03:53,662 --> 00:03:57,892
 picked out the auspicious spot for a home and told Chairman Jin 

48
00:03:57,892 --> 00:04:02,762
  that as long as they were good at heart, their money would never dry up. 

49
00:04:03,432 --> 00:04:05,932
 The name "Jeongsimjae..." 

50
00:04:05,932 --> 00:04:08,901
 literally means "righteous heart." 

51
00:04:27,562 --> 00:04:30,492
Wow, this is amazing.

52
00:04:32,132 --> 00:04:35,202
One, two, three, four, five.

53
00:04:35,202 --> 00:04:37,932
Gosh. How many rooms are there?

54
00:04:37,932 --> 00:04:39,772
Thirteen.

55
00:04:40,672 --> 00:04:43,512
What? How do you know that?

56
00:04:43,512 --> 00:04:46,642
Have you been here without me?

57
00:04:46,642 --> 00:04:49,012
Don't be silly.

58
00:04:49,012 --> 00:04:51,512
Hyeong Jun, you promised Mom.

59
00:04:51,512 --> 00:04:53,521
That you'll be a good boy today.

60
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:55,021
Yes.

61
00:04:56,052 --> 00:04:57,952
Do Jun, you too.

62
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,322
Don't get too nervous.

63
00:05:00,322 --> 00:05:03,962
I think you're the one who’s nervous.

64
00:05:03,962 --> 00:05:05,431
What?

65
00:05:06,762 --> 00:05:11,271
Let's go. Grandma and Grandpa will be waiting.

66
00:05:12,502 --> 00:05:14,041

However busy you are, the meat and fish cannot be cold.

76
00:06:17,971 --> 00:06:21,971
Reheat and re-serve every now and then.

77
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:29,211
- Do not scrimp on the salt. 
 - I understand.

78
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:32,212
People these days eat less salt to stay healthy,

79
00:06:32,212 --> 00:06:34,181
but food must be seasoned enough.

80
00:06:34,181 --> 00:06:36,751
Don't worry about that, Mother.

81
00:06:36,751 --> 00:06:39,692
Your first daughter-in-law has everything under control.

82
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:43,292
I'll teach my sister-in-law how we do things.

83
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:45,392
Don't worry, okay?

84
00:06:46,692 --> 00:06:49,031
My husband handpicked

85
00:06:49,031 --> 00:06:52,332
Soonyang Hotel's best cooks and waiting staff.

86
00:06:52,332 --> 00:06:55,372
Don't worry about anything and stay by Father's side.

87
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:57,112
You're the guest of honor.

88
00:06:57,112 --> 00:07:01,141
It's your father-in-law's birthday, and he's the one who won the medal.

89
00:07:01,141 --> 00:07:02,582
How am I the guest of honor?

90
00:07:02,582 --> 00:07:04,452
Don't say that.

91
00:07:06,211 --> 00:07:09,251
Soonyang owes its immense growth to you, Mother.

92
00:07:09,251 --> 00:07:12,322
Who doesn't know that?

93
00:07:12,322 --> 00:07:15,522
That's such a sweet way of telling me to stop nagging

94
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:17,991
and get out of the kitchen.

95
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:21,631
Hello, Hae In.

96
00:07:24,072 --> 00:07:28,202
What should I do, Mother?

97
00:07:28,202 --> 00:07:30,842
Don't even think of doing anything.

98
00:07:30,842 --> 00:07:34,372
Stay with Yoon Ki and the boys.

99
00:07:36,612 --> 00:07:38,852
- Mother, leave it to us. 
 - Okay.

100
00:07:38,852 --> 00:07:41,081
Go on.

101
00:07:42,022 --> 00:07:43,692
Do you want me

102
00:07:43,692 --> 00:07:45,792
- to prepare the fruit? 
 - Mr. Ko, get the fruit.

103
00:07:45,792 --> 00:07:48,091
Yes, Ma'am.

104
00:07:48,091 --> 00:07:49,961
They're gutsy.

105
00:07:49,961 --> 00:07:53,032
He cut off contact to marry a woman his parents disapproved of.

106
00:07:53,032 --> 00:07:55,231
They then show up after ten years

107
00:07:55,231 --> 00:07:58,301
to laugh and smile and enjoy having a family.

108
00:07:59,101 --> 00:08:01,771
I'm incapable of putting on such an act.

109
00:08:01,771 --> 00:08:04,812
She's not like us at all.

110
00:08:04,812 --> 00:08:07,111
She was an actress.

111
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,411
She doesn't suit this family.

112
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:12,211
She belongs on stage.

113
00:08:12,211 --> 00:08:13,782
Right?

114
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:19,292
Are you being bullies now because you weren't in school?

115
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:23,562
You have way too many wrinkles around your eyes.

116
00:08:23,562 --> 00:08:26,792
- Agassi. 
 - What are you doing?

117
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:30,031
With so many people watching?

118
00:08:30,772 --> 00:08:32,671
Ms. Lee.

119
00:08:35,001 --> 00:08:37,772
Don't try to play a daughter-in-law

120
00:08:37,772 --> 00:08:39,511
and stick to what you have been doing.

121
00:08:39,511 --> 00:08:43,411
Stand still like a portrait and smile prettily.

122
00:08:44,412 --> 00:08:46,311
You're good at that.

123
00:09:01,361 --> 00:09:03,631
 Happy birthday, Sir. 

124
00:09:04,302 --> 00:09:06,471
 Happy birthday, sir. 

125
00:09:06,471 --> 00:09:08,172
 Let's have a drink. 

126
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:11,542
 - Happy birthday. 
 - Happy birthday, Hyungnim. 

127
00:09:15,942 --> 00:09:18,052
He studied in Tokyo

128
00:09:18,052 --> 00:09:21,981
and works as a master at a sushi restaurant in Ginza.

129
00:09:21,981 --> 00:09:24,892
The Japanese refused to let him go,

130
00:09:24,892 --> 00:09:27,121
but I literally abducted him and got him

131
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:31,432
on an early flight so he could cater for you today.

132
00:09:31,432 --> 00:09:32,991
It's good, isn't it?

133
00:09:32,991 --> 00:09:34,362
Yes.

134
00:09:34,362 --> 00:09:35,531
I knew it.

135
00:09:35,531 --> 00:09:40,001
Domestic goods still can't compare to Japanese.

136
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:44,571
How many?

137
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:48,481
Grains of rice. How many are there?

138
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:51,682
The ideal weight of fish and rice is 15g...

139
00:09:51,682 --> 00:09:53,511
So how many?

140
00:09:54,351 --> 00:09:58,051
- I apologize, Sir. 
 - There are 320.

141
00:09:58,051 --> 00:10:00,952
A trained sushi master

142
00:10:00,952 --> 00:10:05,131
usually picks up 320 grains of rice to make one piece.

143
00:10:05,131 --> 00:10:08,731
That many might be appropriate for lunch,

144
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:12,971
but on a day like this, or when served with alcohol,

145
00:10:12,971 --> 00:10:16,201
use just 280 grains of rice, okay?

146
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:18,842
So it's not too filling.

147
00:10:18,842 --> 00:10:21,111
I'll do that, Chairman.

148
00:10:25,511 --> 00:10:28,351
Cheongwadae sent a messenger, Chairman.

149
00:10:31,091 --> 00:10:34,052
- The Blue House? 
 - Yes.

150
00:10:47,342 --> 00:10:48,602
Chairman.

151
00:10:48,602 --> 00:10:50,341
 Happy birthday. 

152
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:52,312
Thank you. Eat your fill.

153
00:10:52,312 --> 00:10:54,562
 Thank you. 

154
00:10:56,981 --> 00:11:01,582
Father, how did you know the number of rice grains?

155
00:11:01,582 --> 00:11:05,022
Is there a Japanese restaurant in Soonyang Hotel, yes or no?

156
00:11:05,022 --> 00:11:06,221
Of course...

157
00:11:06,221 --> 00:11:09,422
There. Must I say more?

158
00:11:12,662 --> 00:11:16,161
Hey, you. Deputy CEO of Soonyang Electronics.

159
00:11:16,161 --> 00:11:20,931
Tell me. What are this year's sales?

160
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:22,602
It's 2.3 billion dollars.

161
00:11:22,602 --> 00:11:24,741
- Up by 15 percent... 
 - And the Japanese?

162
00:11:24,741 --> 00:11:28,641
H made 26.5 billion dollars, and T made 20 billion dollars.

163
00:11:28,641 --> 00:11:30,312
Both made more than ten times we did.

164
00:11:30,312 --> 00:11:33,482
Our deputy CEO is right then.

165
00:11:33,482 --> 00:11:36,621
We still can't compare to the Japanese.

166
00:11:37,892 --> 00:11:39,122
Is that true?

167
00:11:39,122 --> 00:11:41,322
Still, we're number one in our country.

168
00:11:41,322 --> 00:11:43,022
We have never lost

169
00:11:43,022 --> 00:11:45,792
the top spot in Korea in the white goods market.

170
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:49,401
The top spot… in Korea.

171
00:11:49,401 --> 00:11:51,932
"The top spot in Korea"?

172
00:11:51,932 --> 00:11:54,901
Are you competing in a national competition?

173
00:12:00,682 --> 00:12:02,341
Father.

174
00:12:03,481 --> 00:12:06,352
Yoon Ki wishes to say hello.

175
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:13,951
Congratulations on winning a medal and happy birthday, Father.

176
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:17,792
He opened a film distribution company.

177
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:20,731
His first movie will be shown this year.

178
00:12:20,731 --> 00:12:22,601
Aren't you proud of him?

179
00:12:22,601 --> 00:12:25,572
He did it all without your help.

180
00:12:25,572 --> 00:12:29,341
He will do well. He's your son.

181
00:12:29,341 --> 00:12:34,172
He said he will visit every weekend like the others.

182
00:12:34,172 --> 00:12:36,012
If you permit it.

183
00:12:36,012 --> 00:12:40,511
He did a great job raising both boys.

184
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:44,581
Hyeong Jun, Do Jun, come and meet your grandfather.

185
00:12:45,591 --> 00:12:47,221
Bow.

186
00:12:47,221 --> 00:12:48,922
Yes, Father.

187
00:12:48,922 --> 00:12:50,662
Don't be so angry with him.

188
00:12:50,662 --> 00:12:53,162
Do movies make money, Mister?

189
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:55,562
Something more valuable than money...

190
00:12:55,562 --> 00:12:57,701
Will it help Soonyang?

191
00:12:57,701 --> 00:12:59,472
- Father. 
 - It makes no money

192
00:12:59,472 --> 00:13:02,242
and won't help Soonyang.

193
00:13:02,242 --> 00:13:04,741
Why are you my son?

194
00:13:06,741 --> 00:13:09,912
- Chairman. 
 - The guests are leaving.

195
00:13:10,611 --> 00:13:12,611
Throw salt after them.

196
00:13:17,522 --> 00:13:19,322
It really is a party.

197
00:13:19,322 --> 00:13:22,461
There are beggars everywhere.

198
00:13:25,432 --> 00:13:29,062
He doesn't mean what he says.

199
00:13:32,932 --> 00:13:36,402
Yoon Ki, you know what your father's like.

200
00:13:36,402 --> 00:13:39,841
Don't take it to heart, okay?

201
00:13:39,841 --> 00:13:42,042
Yes. Leave it at that today.

202
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:44,411
Let's take it slowly.

203
00:13:44,411 --> 00:13:45,411
Let's go and eat.

204
00:13:45,411 --> 00:13:48,081
You eat lots.

205
00:13:50,151 --> 00:13:52,452
 He married against his parents' will, 

206
00:13:52,452 --> 00:13:55,292
 so 4-0's succession rights were revoked. 

207
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,022
Hello.

208
00:13:57,022 --> 00:14:00,761
 It’s exactly the same as what I know. 

209
00:14:19,281 --> 00:14:20,852
 But... 

210
00:14:26,022 --> 00:14:27,921
 I'm missing. 

211
00:14:29,522 --> 00:14:33,131
 I know all there is to know about Soonyang's Jin family, 

212
00:14:33,131 --> 00:14:34,501
 but... 

213
00:14:34,501 --> 00:14:36,731
   

214
00:14:36,731 --> 00:14:39,201
   

215
00:14:42,472 --> 00:14:47,042
 I have no information on 4-2 Jin Do Jun. 

216
00:14:48,182 --> 00:14:49,682
 Why... 

217
00:14:49,682 --> 00:14:54,612
 is my mind blank when it comes to 4-2 Jin Do Jun? 

218
00:14:56,081 --> 00:14:57,681
 Why is that? 

219
00:15:04,432 --> 00:15:06,331
You know, Chairman,

220
00:15:06,331 --> 00:15:09,331
how the great 6.29 Declaration came to be.

221
00:15:09,331 --> 00:15:15,741
It was all thanks to the president's concern and thoughtfulness.

222
00:15:15,741 --> 00:15:17,472
History will record him

223
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:21,572
as the father of democracy in our land.

224
00:15:23,842 --> 00:15:26,411
Try the tea.

225
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:28,552
It smells lovely.

226
00:15:32,721 --> 00:15:34,771
During the next administration,

227
00:15:35,522 --> 00:15:39,591
shouldn't the average man take the lead role?

228
00:15:40,662 --> 00:15:45,662
History is marching on, and Soonyang should join the flow.

229
00:15:47,131 --> 00:15:51,472
The president wishes to give you an opportunity.

230
00:15:59,182 --> 00:16:00,951
Mr. Lee.

231
00:16:00,951 --> 00:16:02,352
Yes, Sir.

232
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:06,221
Were you aware?

233
00:16:06,952 --> 00:16:11,731
This gentleman from the Blue House knew.

234
00:16:18,171 --> 00:16:21,841
This medal you see here.

235
00:16:22,801 --> 00:16:24,901
This is a deferred payment.

236
00:16:26,641 --> 00:16:29,282
He came here to collect.

237
00:16:31,811 --> 00:16:33,511
So

238
00:16:36,521 --> 00:16:39,751
how much do you want for it?

239
00:16:54,071 --> 00:16:58,942
♪   Your window just won't open   ♪

240
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:04,211
♪   I'll knock on it with the moonlight of love   ♪

241
00:17:20,491 --> 00:17:25,372
♪   Oh, my love   ♪

242
00:17:25,372 --> 00:17:29,442
♪   Open the window to let in the breeze   ♪

243
00:17:50,262 --> 00:17:52,732
Vice-Chairman Jin Seong Jun?

244
00:18:00,102 --> 00:18:02,741
It's obvious what movies make money.

245
00:18:02,741 --> 00:18:04,872
- Hong Kongers shooting guns. 
 - "A Better Tomorrow"?

246
00:18:04,872 --> 00:18:07,712
- Or Americans going to war. 
 - "Platoon."

247
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,841
So what kind of movie are you making?

248
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:12,611
It's about the French people praying.

249
00:18:12,611 --> 00:18:14,721
It's called "Under the Sun of Satan."

250
00:18:14,721 --> 00:18:18,151
I thought you wanted to make a movie, not build a hotel.

251
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:21,442
Do you want to make everyone fall asleep?

252
00:18:21,442 --> 00:18:24,362
Dad! Do Jun is in trouble.

253
00:18:24,362 --> 00:18:26,092
He's upstairs now.

254
00:18:36,272 --> 00:18:40,341
You broke this vase. Okay, boy?

255
00:18:40,341 --> 00:18:42,812
We're the only ones in this room right now.

256
00:18:42,812 --> 00:18:47,411
No matter what you say, everyone will believe me.

257
00:18:48,122 --> 00:18:51,252
Why? Because I'm the rightful heir to the throne,

258
00:18:51,252 --> 00:18:54,102
and Grandpa will side with me no matter what.

259
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:07,072
Did you just scoff?

260
00:19:07,072 --> 00:19:10,472
You were a real mess even when you were young.

261
00:19:10,472 --> 00:19:13,071
What? Have you lost your mind?

262
00:19:13,071 --> 00:19:15,211
Seong Jun!

263
00:19:18,052 --> 00:19:21,251
- Hey. My gosh, are you all right? 
 - What happened?

264
00:19:21,251 --> 00:19:23,281
- Do you know how much this costs? 
 - Are you okay?

265
00:19:23,281 --> 00:19:26,681
Father absolutely treasures this porcelain vase.

266
00:19:26,681 --> 00:19:28,092
It was him.

267
00:19:28,092 --> 00:19:31,792
He broke it. He tried to run away, but I caught him.

268
00:19:31,792 --> 00:19:34,731
- Oh, dear. 
 - Do Jun.

269
00:19:34,731 --> 00:19:37,602
Is that true?

270
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:42,302
Hold on. Yoon Ki.

271
00:19:42,302 --> 00:19:44,202
This is making me very uncomfortable.

272
00:19:44,202 --> 00:19:48,682
Are you implying that Seong Jun could be lying?

273
00:19:48,682 --> 00:19:50,641
How could you accuse Seong Jun of lying...

274
00:19:50,641 --> 00:19:53,652
He is lying.

275
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:56,452
What? What do you mean?

276
00:19:56,452 --> 00:19:58,521
The vase...

277
00:20:01,692 --> 00:20:03,961
He's the one who broke it.

278
00:20:05,862 --> 00:20:08,762
He was trying to steal the chairman's belonging.

279
00:20:08,762 --> 00:20:11,261
I caught him in the act.

280
00:20:27,051 --> 00:20:29,852
He got flustered and tried to run away, but...

281
00:20:29,852 --> 00:20:31,321
- Hey! 
 - No!

282
00:20:31,321 --> 00:20:33,452
- Seong Jun! 
 - Do Jun.

283
00:20:33,452 --> 00:20:35,320
- Are you all right? 
 - What is going on?

284
00:20:36,252 --> 00:20:39,691
- Father. 
 - Seong Jun...

285
00:20:39,691 --> 00:20:41,332
It wasn't me, Grandpa.

286
00:20:41,332 --> 00:20:44,702
- I didn't break it. I swear... 
 - Enough.

287
00:20:45,931 --> 00:20:48,372
Shut your mouth.

288
00:20:53,512 --> 00:20:55,712
 This happened in 1987, 

289
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:58,112
 at the sixtieth birthday party for your grandfather, 

290
00:20:58,112 --> 00:21:00,652
 former Chairman Jin. 

291
00:21:00,652 --> 00:21:03,482
 1987. 

292
00:21:03,482 --> 00:21:06,092
 Chairman Jin Yang Cheol. 

293
00:21:08,422 --> 00:21:13,561
 And his sixtieth birthday party, you smashed the Goryeo celadon that he cherished 

294
00:21:13,561 --> 00:21:17,461
 and were scolded by him for the first time. 

295
00:21:17,461 --> 00:21:19,672
 The smashed vase? 

296
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:23,102
Seong Jun.

297
00:21:23,102 --> 00:21:25,972
Do you know what you did wrong?

298
00:21:28,182 --> 00:21:29,811
Come here.

299
00:21:32,352 --> 00:21:34,052
Sit down.

300
00:21:40,622 --> 00:21:45,621
You see, I don't care about this vase.

301
00:21:45,621 --> 00:21:49,731
Seong Jun, you will continue my legacy

302
00:21:49,731 --> 00:21:53,632
and become the owner of Soonyang in the future.

303
00:21:53,632 --> 00:21:55,242
Okay?

304
00:21:56,772 --> 00:21:59,812
Everything you say

305
00:21:59,812 --> 00:22:02,712
and do

306
00:22:02,712 --> 00:22:05,642
could make or break ten thousand employees' livelihoods.

307
00:22:06,582 --> 00:22:10,722
Even their families' livelihoods will depend on you.

308
00:22:15,021 --> 00:22:19,031
Yet you can't even keep your emotions under control?

309
00:22:19,031 --> 00:22:21,492
Acting up like this

310
00:22:24,432 --> 00:22:26,401
 It wasn't an adequate quality... 

311
00:22:26,401 --> 00:22:28,602
"Isn't an adequate quality..."

312
00:22:28,602 --> 00:22:30,502
isn't an adequate quality...

313
00:22:30,502 --> 00:22:34,511
"in someone who will run a business that is Soonyang."

314
00:22:34,511 --> 00:22:38,652
in someone who will run the business

315
00:22:38,652 --> 00:22:41,311
that is Soonyang.

316
00:22:43,352 --> 00:22:46,221
 What I read in his autobiography is unfolding before my eyes. 

317
00:22:46,221 --> 00:22:48,921
 It was white porcelain. 

318
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:53,561
 My grandfather's vase that I broke. 

319
00:22:53,561 --> 00:22:57,032
 It wasn't Goryeo celadon. It was a white porcelain vase. 

320
00:23:03,901 --> 00:23:05,701
 Everything is happening 

321
00:23:05,701 --> 00:23:10,182
 exactly as I know it. 

322
00:23:23,122 --> 00:23:25,931
 The past as I know it. 

323
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:29,761
 I'm in Korea in the year 1987. 

324
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:33,410
 Then... 

325
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,800
   

326
00:23:34,801 --> 00:23:36,101
 If that's the case... 

327
00:23:36,101 --> 00:23:38,380
   

328
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,780
   

329
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:54,422
   

330
00:24:01,401 --> 00:24:04,101
That was a great meal. Let's go.

331
00:24:09,471 --> 00:24:11,572
- Thank you. 
 - Did you enjoy the food?

332
00:24:11,572 --> 00:24:14,271
- Yes. 
 - Go back safely.

333
00:24:14,271 --> 00:24:16,042
Hyeon Min?

334
00:24:38,132 --> 00:24:40,102
Mom.

335
00:24:49,682 --> 00:24:52,112
   

336
00:24:52,112 --> 00:24:54,351
- Hyeon Min! 
 - You're here.

337
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:55,781
Dad!

338
00:24:55,781 --> 00:24:57,152
Hi, Hyeon Min!

339
00:24:57,152 --> 00:25:00,392
Lucky you, Hyeon Min! Daddy picked up fried chicken for you.

340
00:25:00,392 --> 00:25:02,392
Who do you like more? Mommy or Daddy?

341
00:25:02,392 --> 00:25:04,661
Mommy!

342
00:25:04,661 --> 00:25:06,162
- I knew it! 
 - I'll do better.

343
00:25:06,162 --> 00:25:07,832
- Do you need a hand? 
 - No, I'm good.

344
00:25:07,832 --> 00:25:10,782
Come on. Let's have this fried chicken.

345
00:25:17,771 --> 00:25:20,842
 We found Do Jun. 

346
00:25:20,842 --> 00:25:23,641
We'll get there soon, too.

347
00:25:23,641 --> 00:25:26,182
Thank you, Section Chief Oh.

348
00:25:26,182 --> 00:25:27,911
Okay.

349
00:25:29,222 --> 00:25:32,372
Do Jun is okay. You can put your worries to rest now.

350
00:25:33,892 --> 00:25:35,861
Thank goodness.

351
00:25:38,532 --> 00:25:40,461
Hello...

352
00:25:44,832 --> 00:25:46,430
Are you here alone?

353
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:49,000
Are your parents not here with you?

354
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:55,941
Can I have one serving of gukbap (rice soup)?

355
00:25:57,612 --> 00:26:01,482
Sure. You can take that table over there.

356
00:27:00,112 --> 00:27:01,911
Hello...

357
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,741
Do Jun.

358
00:27:08,882 --> 00:27:13,052
What are you doing here? I was so worried.

359
00:27:15,221 --> 00:27:18,521
Get up. Let's go.

360
00:27:18,521 --> 00:27:20,992
Let's go home.

361
00:27:22,332 --> 00:27:27,102
Let's talk at home.

362
00:27:53,192 --> 00:27:57,031
   

363
00:28:05,672 --> 00:28:07,641
What's wrong, Do Jun?

364
00:28:07,641 --> 00:28:09,742
What is it?

365
00:28:12,251 --> 00:28:14,451
I'm relieved.

366
00:28:16,922 --> 00:28:19,592
Mom's alive.

367
00:28:20,952 --> 00:28:23,792
I'm so relieved.

368
00:28:29,761 --> 00:28:31,931
Mom is relieved, too.

369
00:28:32,702 --> 00:28:35,402
Thank goodness.

370
00:28:36,842 --> 00:28:39,511
I have you.

371
00:28:41,112 --> 00:28:42,881
Don't cry.

372
00:28:55,592 --> 00:28:59,592
That poor thing must've been so scared. Look how he ran away.

373
00:29:01,561 --> 00:29:03,602
Well done.

374
00:29:04,261 --> 00:29:08,502
Way to go.

375
00:29:09,902 --> 00:29:14,041
Your son and grandsons came to see you after ten years.

376
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:17,112
How could you read a book after kicking them out like that?

377
00:29:17,112 --> 00:29:20,211
My son and grandsons? Whom?

378
00:29:20,211 --> 00:29:23,182
I only scolded my eldest grandson,

379
00:29:23,182 --> 00:29:24,982
Seong Jun. No one else.

380
00:29:24,982 --> 00:29:28,092
You can't expect all your children to be the same.

381
00:29:28,092 --> 00:29:31,321
Let at least one of them do what they want.

382
00:29:31,321 --> 00:29:35,062
I fed them and paid for their education, so I must get my money's worth.

383
00:29:35,062 --> 00:29:38,132
I never invest in things where I can't get my money's worth.

384
00:29:39,632 --> 00:29:43,141
You'd better not coddle Yoon Ki.

385
00:29:46,442 --> 00:29:48,342
The others will turn out like him.

386
00:30:07,592 --> 00:30:11,832
 The only person in this family who I know nothing about 

387
00:30:11,832 --> 00:30:15,742
 is me, 4-2 Jin Do Jun. 

388
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:20,471
 Am I living as Jin Do Jun now because I'm possessed? 

389
00:30:20,471 --> 00:30:22,311
   

390
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:29,952
   

391
00:30:29,952 --> 00:30:33,521
- Mom. 
 - Hi, Son!

392
00:30:33,521 --> 00:30:34,592
Hey, you. Come here.

393
00:30:34,592 --> 00:30:37,261
- Oh, look at you. 
 - Gosh, stop!

394
00:30:37,261 --> 00:30:40,162
- Run! Go! 
 - Hey, where are you going?

395
00:30:40,162 --> 00:30:44,201
- Oh, nice one. 
 - Let's cheer for your brother!

396
00:30:44,201 --> 00:30:47,731
- Nice. 
 - Well done.

397
00:30:48,801 --> 00:30:51,001
 Or did I simply travel back in time? 

398
00:30:51,001 --> 00:30:54,111
 If not that... Have I been reincarnated? 

399
00:30:54,111 --> 00:30:56,481
 How did this happen? 

400
00:30:56,481 --> 00:30:58,282
   

401
00:31:03,582 --> 00:31:05,682
Why are you still up?

402
00:31:05,682 --> 00:31:07,521
It's getting late.

403
00:31:10,362 --> 00:31:14,731
Do Jun, what happened today... It must've been a lot for you.

404
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:31,642
At first, I felt the same way.

405
00:31:32,481 --> 00:31:34,981
"What am I doing here?"

406
00:31:34,981 --> 00:31:38,622
"I don't belong in this world."

407
00:31:38,622 --> 00:31:42,821
I couldn't understand them. It was very frustrating.

408
00:31:43,422 --> 00:31:46,431
Did you feel the same way?

409
00:31:47,862 --> 00:31:48,832
Does that mean...

410
00:31:48,832 --> 00:31:50,740
It felt so foreign to me.

411
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:54,670
I was scared, and it was uncomfortable.

412
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:59,072
I almost regretted marrying your dad.

413
00:32:01,241 --> 00:32:04,712
But now, it's not so bad.

414
00:32:06,611 --> 00:32:12,792
I found a reason to accept them as my family.

415
00:32:13,452 --> 00:32:15,521
A reason to accept them as your family?

416
00:32:15,521 --> 00:32:19,161
You and Hyeong Jun.

417
00:32:19,892 --> 00:32:26,332
Do Jun, I'm certain that you'll find your reason too, one day.

418
00:32:45,592 --> 00:32:49,192
All the companies are dropping their prices for their 64K DRAMs.

419
00:32:49,922 --> 00:32:53,272
Soonyang Semiconductor started exporting them this month.

420
00:32:53,272 --> 00:32:55,461
Japan and the US are already dominating the market.

421
00:32:55,461 --> 00:32:58,231
So if they're charging less than half of what we're asking for,

422
00:32:58,231 --> 00:33:01,881
Soonyang Semiconductor will not survive in the market, Chairman.

423
00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:08,642
What time is it now... in New York?

424
00:33:09,811 --> 00:33:11,142
It's 9 p.m., Sir.

425
00:33:11,142 --> 00:33:13,251
Is Im Pil Sung in New York now?

426
00:33:13,251 --> 00:33:15,122
I'll tell him to give you a call at once.

427
00:33:15,122 --> 00:33:17,322
No, don't wake him up.

428
00:33:18,252 --> 00:33:20,921
Just tell him to fax it over when he wakes up.

429
00:33:20,921 --> 00:33:23,522
- Fax? What do you need, Sir? 
 - His resignation letter.

430
00:33:23,522 --> 00:33:25,191
Pardon me?

431
00:33:30,962 --> 00:33:36,971
I didn't know that a knife was being held to my throat... until I read that newspaper.

432
00:33:39,372 --> 00:33:41,522
Do you think that this is acceptable?

433
00:33:43,682 --> 00:33:46,451
Did he go to the US to eat hamburgers?

434
00:33:47,111 --> 00:33:49,761
I'm done paying for his hamburgers.

435
00:33:51,682 --> 00:33:52,892
I saw the news, Father.

436
00:33:52,892 --> 00:33:57,122
The American companies slashed their price from 3 to 1.80 dollars.

437
00:33:57,122 --> 00:34:00,591
And the Japanese companies said they would sell it for 0.30 dollars.

438
00:34:00,591 --> 00:34:03,202
If we sell ours at the price the Japanese companies are offering,

439
00:34:03,202 --> 00:34:07,132
we will lose 130 million dollars this year alone.

440
00:34:07,132 --> 00:34:10,632
We're like shrimp... getting squashed between two fighting whales.

441
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,521
The semiconductor business...

442
00:34:13,142 --> 00:34:14,942
Let's just give up here.

443
00:34:14,942 --> 00:34:16,781
I'm afraid we came too far.

444
00:34:16,781 --> 00:34:20,441
- The initial investment alone... 
 - Right, so let's cut our losses and call it quits.

445
00:34:21,182 --> 00:34:24,032
Let's stop trying to fill a bottomless pit.

446
00:34:24,032 --> 00:34:26,682
Youngjin Semiconductor has given up too.

447
00:34:26,682 --> 00:34:29,402
They're being sold to a Japanese company.

448
00:34:30,562 --> 00:34:34,332
Think of the question you always ask us.

449
00:34:34,332 --> 00:34:36,982
Will the semiconductor business bring in money?

450
00:34:39,372 --> 00:34:42,042
   

451
00:34:46,911 --> 00:34:49,812
What brings you by at this hour?

452
00:34:49,812 --> 00:34:53,681
I'm sorry for causing you concern yesterday.

453
00:34:58,182 --> 00:35:00,721
I'm here to apologize to Grandpa.

454
00:35:01,352 --> 00:35:06,191
Look at you talking like a grown man. You're so mature.

455
00:35:06,191 --> 00:35:09,332
Come with me. He's upstairs in his study.

456
00:35:09,332 --> 00:35:10,901
Come on.

457
00:35:17,002 --> 00:35:19,542
Children should behave like Children.

458
00:35:19,542 --> 00:35:23,682
Is she naive? Or is she becoming dense?

459
00:35:23,682 --> 00:35:26,182
- Hey. 
 - I'm talking about Mother.

460
00:35:26,182 --> 00:35:28,082
Oh.

461
00:35:28,082 --> 00:35:29,551
Isn't it so obvious?

462
00:35:29,551 --> 00:35:32,551
Clearly, he memorized what his father told him to say.

463
00:35:32,551 --> 00:35:34,901
He's talking like a man in his forties.

464
00:35:37,122 --> 00:35:38,892
Wait here.

465
00:35:38,892 --> 00:35:41,832
He'll be out soon.

466
00:35:41,832 --> 00:35:43,761
You can watch TV if you get bored.

467
00:35:43,761 --> 00:35:45,561
- Okay. 
 - All right, then.

468
00:35:50,471 --> 00:35:52,042
   

469
00:35:52,042 --> 00:35:54,992
   

470
00:36:02,051 --> 00:36:04,122
You should deliver the campaign fund yourself

471
00:36:04,122 --> 00:36:06,852
and meet him in person.

472
00:36:06,852 --> 00:36:08,252
What?

473
00:36:08,962 --> 00:36:11,921
The general election will take place in April next year.

474
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:13,891
You need a nomination.

475
00:36:14,832 --> 00:36:18,261
Oh, right. Honey, you know everything.

476
00:36:18,261 --> 00:36:20,702
You sure take after Father.

477
00:36:25,841 --> 00:36:28,341
I heard you had visitors from Cheongwadae yesterday.

478
00:36:28,341 --> 00:36:31,341
Did they ask you to back Roh Tae Woo's campaign?

479
00:36:34,212 --> 00:36:38,682
Director Lee only listens and never spills what he hears.

480
00:36:38,682 --> 00:36:41,652
I'm your daughter, Father. Of course, I know that much.

481
00:36:41,652 --> 00:36:43,591
You silly goose.

482
00:36:43,591 --> 00:36:45,721
Take a seat.

483
00:36:45,721 --> 00:36:47,562
You too.

484
00:36:49,062 --> 00:36:53,502
Instead of calling you to Cheongwadae, they came all the way here.

485
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,501
It means the tables have turned.

486
00:36:55,501 --> 00:36:57,672
It tells me that Roh Tae Woo is at a disadvantage.

487
00:36:57,672 --> 00:37:02,541
I'm not surprised. After all the protests and uprisings... to end the military dictatorship,

488
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:05,152
who'd want to vote for another Military Academy graduate?

489
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:08,151
Unless the entire nation is suffering from amnesia collectively.

490
00:37:08,151 --> 00:37:10,152
The two Kims will agree on a single candidacy soon.

491
00:37:10,152 --> 00:37:12,452
The opposition power will win this time, Father.

492
00:37:12,452 --> 00:37:14,221
That being said,

493
00:37:14,221 --> 00:37:17,522
shouldn't you decide which candidate to support now?

494
00:37:17,522 --> 00:37:19,591
Between DJ and YS, choose the one who's more likely to win...

495
00:37:19,591 --> 00:37:23,361
Right. So who would that be?

496
00:37:23,361 --> 00:37:25,102
DJ, obviously.

497
00:37:25,102 --> 00:37:30,002
He is supported by all the student and civic groups... that helped establish the direct election system.

498
00:37:31,471 --> 00:37:34,042
Dong Ki, you should never get into politics.

499
00:37:34,042 --> 00:37:36,779
We should support YS, not DJ.

500
00:37:36,779 --> 00:37:38,781
I know DJ has many fans, but he also has many enemies.

501
00:37:38,781 --> 00:37:42,181
When it's a neck-and-neck fight, the one with less enemies will win.

502
00:37:43,182 --> 00:37:46,182
Aren't you saying that because you dislike DJ?

503
00:37:46,182 --> 00:37:51,452
I heard Kim Dae Jung was against... nominating Chang Je since he worked as a public security prosecutor.

504
00:37:52,332 --> 00:37:54,361
Why are you roping Chang Je into this?

505
00:37:54,361 --> 00:37:57,461
I am saying these things for the sake of the company's future.

506
00:37:58,202 --> 00:38:01,401
- Father! 
 - Be quiet.

507
00:38:01,401 --> 00:38:04,671
I'm sorry for causing you concern, Father.

508
00:38:04,671 --> 00:38:06,471
- Mr. Lee. 
 - Yes, Sir.

509
00:38:06,471 --> 00:38:08,571
As for their approval ratings,

510
00:38:08,571 --> 00:38:11,912
get Soonyang Economic Research Institute to look into it.

511
00:38:11,912 --> 00:38:15,082
Tell them to find out which one of them deserves my money more.

512
00:38:15,082 --> 00:38:16,822
Yes, Sir.

513
00:38:18,252 --> 00:38:20,451
Now, get out.

514
00:38:23,162 --> 00:38:26,291
- Oh. 
 - Hey, aren't you Yoon Ki's son?

515
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:30,762
I'm here to apologize to Grandpa for what happened yesterday.

516
00:38:30,762 --> 00:38:35,402
Oh, my. Yoon Ki always had a sly side to him.

517
00:38:35,402 --> 00:38:40,402
After not visiting us once for ten years, he sends his son here daily.

518
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:43,582
Did he come all the way here by himself because his parents told him to?

519
00:38:43,582 --> 00:38:45,582
He sure takes after his father.

520
00:38:45,582 --> 00:38:49,012
Good-looking and calculating.

521
00:38:50,051 --> 00:38:53,192
Your youngest son's child is here to see you, Sir.

522
00:38:53,192 --> 00:38:56,592
I only have two sons. I didn't know I had another son!

523
00:38:56,592 --> 00:38:59,592
 I will talk to him and send him home, Sir. 

524
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:04,932
Come with us. Let's go downstairs.

525
00:39:05,772 --> 00:39:08,702
Please tell Grandpa...

526
00:39:08,702 --> 00:39:13,871
that I'm here to pay for the vase that was broken yesterday.

527
00:39:13,871 --> 00:39:14,911
That punk.

528
00:39:14,911 --> 00:39:17,411
Hey! You little brat.

529
00:39:17,411 --> 00:39:21,882
Hey, do you even know how much that vase costs?

530
00:39:21,882 --> 00:39:23,752
Five bills?

531
00:39:23,752 --> 00:39:26,491
It can't cost more than that.

532
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:29,391
Five bills? What? Five dollars?

533
00:39:29,391 --> 00:39:31,962
Or 50 dollars?

534
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:35,611
No, five million dollars.

535
00:39:36,861 --> 00:39:39,702
What? Five million?

536
00:39:42,772 --> 00:39:46,922
Wouldn't that be enough to fund a presidential election campaign?

537
00:39:48,882 --> 00:39:51,332
 What? Presidential election campaign? 

538
00:39:52,752 --> 00:39:55,282
Please let Grandpa know.

539
00:39:55,282 --> 00:39:59,892
If it were me, I'd back Roh Tae Woo's campaign.

540
00:40:02,292 --> 00:40:06,361
Roh Tae Woo will become President.

541
00:40:08,361 --> 00:40:12,161
Did you eavesdrop on the adults' conversation?

542
00:40:12,161 --> 00:40:15,102
Clearly, your parents couldn't teach you any better.

543
00:40:15,102 --> 00:40:18,441
Is this how your parents taught you?

544
00:40:18,441 --> 00:40:22,342
No one teaches their children to be so brazen.

545
00:40:22,342 --> 00:40:26,141
Just like how no one tells their children to steal their grandfather's things.

546
00:40:26,141 --> 00:40:28,551
- Do Jun. 
 - What?

547
00:40:30,051 --> 00:40:32,351
Young Ki, you must be getting old.

548
00:40:32,351 --> 00:40:35,591
He's just a kid. Why are you getting so worked up?

549
00:40:35,591 --> 00:40:38,692
He read some newspapers, so he's trying to sound like an adult.

550
00:40:38,692 --> 00:40:42,692
Once DJ and YS agree on a unified candidate, Roh Tae Woo can't win.

551
00:40:42,692 --> 00:40:44,502
I assure you that he won't win.

552
00:40:44,502 --> 00:40:47,032
Unified candidacy?

553
00:40:47,032 --> 00:40:51,031
Do you think the two of them will actually reach an agreement?

554
00:40:57,942 --> 00:41:00,181
I do not think so.

555
00:41:02,621 --> 00:41:05,422
Now, that should be enough to compensate him for the broken vase.

556
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:09,052
I'll be off then.

557
00:41:09,052 --> 00:41:10,991
Goodness.

558
00:41:12,661 --> 00:41:18,062
Oh, my. Yoon Ki did a great job, bringing up such a smart boy.

559
00:41:18,062 --> 00:41:19,672
Oh, sorry.

560
00:41:19,672 --> 00:41:21,032
Of course, it's nonsense.

561
00:41:21,032 --> 00:41:23,371
So many people are rooting for a single candidacy.

562
00:41:23,371 --> 00:41:25,942
They won't betray the majority opinion.

563
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:27,911
Both YS and DJ...

564
00:41:27,911 --> 00:41:33,511
have come this far because of their devotion.

565
00:41:33,511 --> 00:41:37,222
They won't gamble on their political careers.

566
00:41:37,222 --> 00:41:39,252
Exactly.

567
00:41:40,991 --> 00:41:45,091
Mr. Oh, take Mr. Chairman's grandson home.

568
00:41:46,632 --> 00:41:50,482
Sir, there's breaking news about the presidential election.

569
00:41:50,482 --> 00:41:52,761
You should see it.

570
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:54,771
What's the matter?

571
00:41:56,002 --> 00:41:58,201
 Kim Young Sam and Kim Dae Jung of the Democratic Party 

572
00:41:58,201 --> 00:42:02,281
 decided against unified candidacy earlier today. 

573
00:42:02,281 --> 00:42:05,382
 Kim Dae Jung clearly expressed 

574
00:42:05,382 --> 00:42:07,712
 that he was against the party convention, 

575
00:42:07,712 --> 00:42:10,882
 which means they will both run for President. 

576
00:42:10,882 --> 00:42:12,152
Father.

577
00:42:12,152 --> 00:42:14,521
 Kim Young Sam and Kim Dae Jung met again... 

578
00:42:14,521 --> 00:42:17,062
- Father! 
 -  to negotiate the details... 

579
00:42:17,062 --> 00:42:19,161
 regarding unified candidacy but failed to reach an agreement. 

580
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:22,261
 Their talk ended when they decided 

581
00:42:22,261 --> 00:42:25,102
 to postpone the deadline to next Monday, 

582
00:42:25,102 --> 00:42:28,602
 which is when Kim Dae Jung would have to reply by. 

583
00:42:28,602 --> 00:42:31,341
Wait, stop!

584
00:42:36,741 --> 00:42:39,341
Chairman would like to speak with you.

585
00:42:39,341 --> 00:42:41,482
Right now.

586
00:42:44,482 --> 00:42:46,551
Tell me.

587
00:42:47,352 --> 00:42:50,061
How did you know they'd decide against a unified candidacy?

588
00:42:50,061 --> 00:42:53,192
I wouldn't be able to concede. That's why.

589
00:42:53,192 --> 00:42:55,242
Because I'd get greedy.

590
00:42:55,242 --> 00:42:58,431
When three candidates are running for class president,

591
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:01,281
the top two candidates will never join hands...

592
00:43:01,281 --> 00:43:04,672
because they both believe that they will win.

593
00:43:04,672 --> 00:43:08,612
Rather, they'll do whatever it takes to make each other lose.

594
00:43:08,612 --> 00:43:11,812
They'll bad-mouth each other and fight.

595
00:43:11,812 --> 00:43:15,152
Then their teachers and classmates

596
00:43:15,152 --> 00:43:18,352
will realize that they, in fact, don't deserve the position.

597
00:43:18,352 --> 00:43:21,021
Just like that, they'll drag each other down.

598
00:43:21,021 --> 00:43:25,061
So the one who was least likely to win will end up winning.

599
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:27,162
Do you mean he'll win by default?

600
00:43:27,162 --> 00:43:30,601
Roh Tae Woo will become President by default.

601
00:43:30,601 --> 00:43:35,371
So I should back Roh Tae Woo. Is that right?

602
00:43:36,641 --> 00:43:40,842
If I were you, I'd give him the money before he became number one.

603
00:43:40,842 --> 00:43:45,481
A lot more than the amount he may be expecting.

604
00:43:45,481 --> 00:43:48,911
He'll be grateful if you give it to him when he's still number three.

605
00:43:48,911 --> 00:43:54,221
But if you wait until he becomes number one, he'll take it for granted.

606
00:44:01,332 --> 00:44:04,531
- Director Lee. 
 - Yes, Chairman.

607
00:44:04,531 --> 00:44:07,771
Tell Manager Oh to have the car ready.

608
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:09,601
Yes, Sir.

609
00:44:12,641 --> 00:44:16,071
- Hey. 
 - Manager Oh, have the car ready.

610
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:18,181
Let me ask you one more question then.

611
00:44:18,181 --> 00:44:22,251
I believe I've already paid you for the broken vase, Grandfather.

612
00:44:22,251 --> 00:44:24,581
It's nothing difficult. It's only a quiz.

613
00:44:24,581 --> 00:44:27,792
Then there must be a prize for getting it right

614
00:44:27,792 --> 00:44:29,952
because it's a quiz.

615
00:44:34,792 --> 00:44:37,692
I don't like to do things for free, either.

616
00:44:39,201 --> 00:44:42,672
We talked about how number 3 can win by default because numbers 1 and 2

617
00:44:42,672 --> 00:44:45,402
are busy fighting, right?

618
00:44:45,402 --> 00:44:46,971
But there's this saying too.

619
00:44:46,971 --> 00:44:51,271
"The shrimp is squashed to death when two whales fight."

620
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:55,051
Then do you think there's a way

621
00:44:55,051 --> 00:44:59,582
for the shrimp to beat the whales?

622
00:45:13,301 --> 00:45:16,301
You're just like other children, after all.

623
00:45:29,281 --> 00:45:31,181
Hey.

624
00:45:31,181 --> 00:45:32,781
Come here.

625
00:45:38,821 --> 00:45:43,991
How did you know the candidacy wouldn't be unified?

626
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:46,362
Yoon Ki, no.

627
00:45:46,362 --> 00:45:49,432
Did your father tell you so?

628
00:45:52,612 --> 00:45:54,641
My brother said so.

629
00:45:54,641 --> 00:45:56,641
Your brother?

630
00:45:56,641 --> 00:45:59,491
This is what we do in times like these.

631
00:45:59,491 --> 00:46:03,281
"It's obvious at a single glance."

632
00:46:03,281 --> 00:46:04,482
What's with this punk?

633
00:46:04,482 --> 00:46:06,692
That's a buzzword by Hwang Ki Soon.

634
00:46:06,692 --> 00:46:07,951
Hwang Ki...

635
00:46:07,951 --> 00:46:11,351
You punk! That's not the way you should talk to your elders.

636
00:46:12,462 --> 00:46:16,761
Do you think there's a way for a shrimp to win against a whale?

637
00:46:16,761 --> 00:46:20,382
I guess you can't give up on the semiconductors, Chairman.

638
00:46:21,701 --> 00:46:24,751
Why do you think I'm so set on semiconductors?

639
00:46:26,971 --> 00:46:32,212
Last summer, in Mokpo, Ulsan, and Changwon,

640
00:46:32,212 --> 00:46:35,882
when the laborers in our factories put on headbands

641
00:46:35,882 --> 00:46:38,582
and stood there protesting

642
00:46:38,582 --> 00:46:42,152
with cranes and excavators, asking me for a raise

643
00:46:42,152 --> 00:46:44,602
and the formation of a labor union,

644
00:46:45,491 --> 00:46:49,691
I had only one thought

645
00:46:50,862 --> 00:46:54,202
in my head.

646
00:46:56,141 --> 00:47:00,102
I am done doing business by using laborers.

647
00:47:00,102 --> 00:47:01,542
Then...

648
00:47:01,542 --> 00:47:03,942
From now on,

649
00:47:03,942 --> 00:47:07,232
we must do business with technology to make a living.

650
00:47:09,551 --> 00:47:15,351
Semiconductors are the future of Soonyang.

651
00:47:16,521 --> 00:47:17,362
I see.

652
00:47:17,362 --> 00:47:20,112
Do you ask if it'll be worth any money?

653
00:47:23,502 --> 00:47:26,971
Am I the only one who sees this?

654
00:47:28,931 --> 00:47:32,781
Why is there nobody else who can think like this old man?

655
00:47:34,141 --> 00:47:38,812
We have to make an astronomical investment, but we do not know if it'll be a success.

656
00:47:38,812 --> 00:47:42,352
The semiconductor business is nothing but a risk,

657
00:47:42,352 --> 00:47:45,062
no, more like gambling at this point, Chairman.

658
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,261
Once our finances look better

659
00:47:50,261 --> 00:47:53,332
by overseas construction business with the government's cooperation,

660
00:47:53,332 --> 00:47:56,782
why don't you resume the semiconductor business then?

661
00:47:56,782 --> 00:48:00,101
Do you know what democratization is?

662
00:48:00,101 --> 00:48:01,871
I'm not sure.

663
00:48:01,871 --> 00:48:07,111
Before, only a single soldier was after the money in my pocket.

664
00:48:07,111 --> 00:48:12,082
That turned into three civilians.

665
00:48:12,082 --> 00:48:14,381
That's democratization.

666
00:48:32,772 --> 00:48:35,171
   

667
00:48:45,382 --> 00:48:47,982
Please pass this on to the president.

668
00:48:47,982 --> 00:48:54,301
Tell him that I believe he will surely put an end to this era of military dictatorship.

669
00:48:54,301 --> 00:48:56,352
Thank you.

670
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:02,491
   

671
00:49:02,491 --> 00:49:06,932
Our chairman was touched deeply by your character

672
00:49:06,932 --> 00:49:11,341
when you said you would not take any political retaliation.

673
00:49:16,312 --> 00:49:21,912
Please use this for the sake of peace in Korea, just as you wanted.

674
00:49:21,912 --> 00:49:23,821
 The campaign of Roh Tae Woo of the Democratic Justice Party was 

675
00:49:23,821 --> 00:49:26,122
 held in the square in front of Gwangju Station. 

676
00:49:26,122 --> 00:49:28,752
 As soon as the campaign began at 2 p.m., 

677
00:49:28,752 --> 00:49:32,462
 young people and university students came out protesting 

678
00:49:32,462 --> 00:49:35,191
 and chanting Kim Dae Jung's name. 

679
00:49:35,191 --> 00:49:37,491
   

680
00:49:46,642 --> 00:49:47,841
   

681
00:49:47,841 --> 00:49:49,312
   

682
00:49:49,312 --> 00:49:52,482
 We talked about how number 3 can win by default because numbers 1 and 2... 

683
00:49:52,482 --> 00:49:54,212
 are busy fighting, right? 

684
00:49:54,212 --> 00:50:00,752
 Then do you think there's a way for the shrimp to beat the whales? 

685
00:50:00,752 --> 00:50:04,292
   

686
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:05,293
Small?

687
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,762
Snack time.

688
00:50:06,762 --> 00:50:12,192
 I finally realized the answer to Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's quiz. 

689
00:50:14,172 --> 00:50:17,772
Grandma, I have something I'd like to say to Grandpa.

690
00:50:17,772 --> 00:50:20,142
Is he home right now?

691
00:50:21,942 --> 00:50:24,892
He's on a business trip to Baghdad?

692
00:50:46,732 --> 00:50:49,832
Then when will he return?

693
00:50:52,871 --> 00:50:55,971
October 29.

694
00:51:00,511 --> 00:51:02,582
By any chance,

695
00:51:02,582 --> 00:51:06,051
do you know what his flight number is?

696
00:51:14,792 --> 00:51:16,931
Okay. Thank you, Grandma.

697
00:51:16,931 --> 00:51:19,661
I'll call you again next time.

698
00:51:19,661 --> 00:51:21,372
Bye.

699
00:51:26,571 --> 00:51:28,741
 CAL 828. 

700
00:51:29,341 --> 00:51:30,942
 The CAL incident of 1987. 

701
00:51:30,942 --> 00:51:33,982
 An aircraft with 95 passengers and 20 flight attendants 

702
00:51:33,982 --> 00:51:37,522
 went missing above Yangon, Myanmar. 

703
00:51:37,522 --> 00:51:41,122
 Chairman Jin Yang Cheol will return to Seoul 

704
00:51:41,122 --> 00:51:43,662
 on that very plane, CAL 828. 

705
00:51:43,662 --> 00:51:49,062
 At midnight in Korea, it will take off from Baghdad Airport, 

706
00:51:49,701 --> 00:51:52,061
 in three hours. 

707
00:51:52,061 --> 00:51:55,602
 I only have three hours of time 

708
00:51:56,441 --> 00:51:59,041
 to save Chairman Jin Yang Cheol. 

709
00:51:59,672 --> 00:52:03,111
So they refuse to accept the terms we suggested?

710
00:52:03,111 --> 00:52:07,712
If we press them by using the royal family, it can happen.

711
00:52:07,712 --> 00:52:09,431
The royal family again?

712
00:52:09,431 --> 00:52:13,582
The second son of the King, Prince Hussein, plans on visiting Abu Dhabi

713
00:52:13,582 --> 00:52:16,291
on the same flight as us, CAL 828.

714
00:52:17,321 --> 00:52:21,191
Director Lee right here is telling me to do a sales pitch

715
00:52:21,191 --> 00:52:24,331
even when I'm on my flight.

716
00:52:29,572 --> 00:52:30,801
   

717
00:52:39,682 --> 00:52:40,982
 You have reached the customer service center. 

718
00:52:40,982 --> 00:52:43,852
It's a bombing attack. We must stop this terrorist attack.

719
00:52:43,852 --> 00:52:44,821
A bombing attack?

720
00:52:44,821 --> 00:52:48,852
On flight CAL 828 from Baghdad Airport to Seoul,

721
00:52:48,852 --> 00:52:51,562
a North Korean agent will plant a bomb.

722
00:52:51,562 --> 00:52:55,991
If you aren't prepared, it will blow up in open waters and kill two passengers.

723
00:52:55,991 --> 00:52:57,132
 Hey, kid. 

724
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:59,971
 A prank call about bombing attacks and abduction of an aircraft is 

725
00:52:59,971 --> 00:53:02,932
 a crime you will be punished for and will have to pay for damages through a civil action. 

726
00:53:02,932 --> 00:53:04,841
It's not a prank. It's true.

727
00:53:04,841 --> 00:53:07,741
Hundreds of lives are in danger.

728
00:53:07,741 --> 00:53:10,741
You have to save them!

729
00:53:12,582 --> 00:53:15,912
Hello?

730
00:53:27,261 --> 00:53:29,292
 Of course. 

731
00:53:29,292 --> 00:53:32,062
 No one will be able to believe me. 

732
00:53:32,702 --> 00:53:35,271
 Not that I am from the future. 

733
00:53:35,271 --> 00:53:38,232
 That I already know everything that will happen 

734
00:53:38,971 --> 00:53:41,372
 from now on. 

735
00:53:42,941 --> 00:53:45,882
   

736
00:53:45,882 --> 00:53:50,651
 It's even hard for me to believe everything that's happening now. 

737
00:53:55,952 --> 00:53:58,961
Grandma, open the door, please.

738
00:53:58,961 --> 00:54:01,361
We have no time, Grandma!

739
00:54:01,361 --> 00:54:03,532
Grandma!

740
00:54:10,141 --> 00:54:12,871
- Bring him a blanket, please. 
 - Yes.

741
00:54:12,871 --> 00:54:15,911
Goodness, what brings you here at this hour?

742
00:54:15,911 --> 00:54:19,281
Grandma, can you let me speak to Grandpa?

743
00:54:19,281 --> 00:54:21,451
There is something I must tell him.

744
00:54:21,451 --> 00:54:24,722
We have no time, Grandma.

745
00:54:24,722 --> 00:54:27,422
Chairman Jin is in a meeting with local Iraqi staff.

746
00:54:27,422 --> 00:54:30,162
I will pass on a message if you leave it with me.

747
00:54:30,162 --> 00:54:32,392
Yes, I am ready.

748
00:54:32,392 --> 00:54:37,431
I finally found out the answer to the quiz you asked, Grandpa.

749
00:54:37,431 --> 00:54:41,031
A way for a shrimp to beat the whales.

750
00:54:41,031 --> 00:54:45,572
Once you see this note, I believe that you will

751
00:54:45,572 --> 00:54:47,841
change your flight.

752
00:54:54,511 --> 00:54:57,781
- Great work. 
 - Great work.

753
00:55:00,151 --> 00:55:03,052
Did anyone call from Seoul?

754
00:55:03,052 --> 00:55:06,191
- No, nobody called. 
 - Good.

755
00:55:06,191 --> 00:55:08,391
Where is it?

756
00:55:09,091 --> 00:55:11,402
Man, where did it go?

757
00:55:16,232 --> 00:55:17,871
- Mr. Kim. 
 - Yes!

758
00:55:17,871 --> 00:55:20,442
- Did you lose something? 
 - No!

759
00:55:21,411 --> 00:55:23,642
Check if anything is missing before we go to the airport.

760
00:55:23,642 --> 00:55:26,081
Yes, Sir.

761
00:55:26,081 --> 00:55:28,012
Great work, Sir.

762
00:55:31,022 --> 00:55:33,321
Where is this thing?

763
00:55:38,692 --> 00:55:40,661
Thank you.

764
00:55:55,642 --> 00:55:58,712
 Next story. On October 6, HHI-1200 loaded the equipment 

765
00:55:58,712 --> 00:56:04,152
 to build the Korean Research Center and left for Antarctica from Ulsan.

767

 After 94 days, the ship stopped momentarily

 at Port Valparaiso, their last stopover.

Jin Do Jun.

773
00:56:27,111 --> 00:56:29,772
 An aircraft with 95 passengers and 20 flight attendants 

774
00:56:29,772 --> 00:56:32,412
 has gone missing above Yangon, Myanmar. 

775
00:56:32,412 --> 00:56:36,482
 The details of the accident are yet to be discovered. 

776
00:56:36,482 --> 00:56:41,882
 Let us report to you the details we know so far along with the list of passengers. 

777
00:56:41,882 --> 00:56:45,792
 Let us connect to the reporter. 

778
00:56:52,662 --> 00:56:54,471
Have you checked the list of passengers?

779
00:56:54,471 --> 00:56:56,701
Young Ki is on it.

780
00:56:58,241 --> 00:57:02,412
Yes, is that the final list of passengers

781
00:57:02,412 --> 00:57:06,841
from Baghdad Airport?

782
00:57:15,852 --> 00:57:17,962
No, right?

783
00:57:19,361 --> 00:57:23,562
Your father isn't the type of person to pass away in vain like this.

784
00:57:26,471 --> 00:57:29,032
I'm... I'm sorry, Mother.

785
00:57:29,032 --> 00:57:31,841
Oh no, Mother! Mother!

786
00:57:31,841 --> 00:57:34,471
- Mother. 
 - Mother! Oh no.

787
00:57:34,471 --> 00:57:36,741
Water, bring her some water!

788
00:57:36,741 --> 00:57:40,542
Goodness, Mother. You poor woman.

789
00:57:43,721 --> 00:57:48,152
 Chairman Jin's autobiography did not mention the CAL incident. 

790
00:57:48,152 --> 00:57:50,651
 Then did something change 

791
00:57:50,651 --> 00:57:53,921
 because I came here? 

792
00:57:56,732 --> 00:57:58,402
 Was I too late? 

793
00:57:58,402 --> 00:58:01,501
 If I had remembered a little earlier, 

794
00:58:02,332 --> 00:58:05,502
 could I have saved Chairman Jin? 

795
00:58:07,411 --> 00:58:09,971
Get it together!

796
00:58:13,951 --> 00:58:17,821
- No! 
 - No, Father!

797
00:58:20,591 --> 00:58:22,691
Father!

798
00:58:25,292 --> 00:58:26,961
Father.

799
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:28,761
Father.

800
00:58:28,761 --> 00:58:31,861
- Father. 
 - Father!

801
00:58:31,861 --> 00:58:34,431
Did someone die around here?

802
00:58:34,431 --> 00:58:36,002
Why are you all crying?

803
00:58:36,002 --> 00:58:40,011
Father, I checked the final list of passengers from Baghdad just now.

804
00:58:40,011 --> 00:58:43,871
So? Are you disappointed that I came back alive?

805
00:58:43,871 --> 00:58:46,611
Don't say that, Father!

806
00:58:46,611 --> 00:58:48,752
Because of you, we were all just...

807
00:58:48,752 --> 00:58:52,482
Good grief. You were all worried for nothing.

808
00:58:52,482 --> 00:58:55,991
Your father is yet to become a ghost.

809
00:58:59,692 --> 00:59:04,462
If we're speaking of ghosts, your mom's face is a ghost.

810
00:59:10,401 --> 00:59:12,172
There was a change in his schedule due to business,

811
00:59:12,172 --> 00:59:14,442
so he had to arrive in Seoul earlier.

812
00:59:14,442 --> 00:59:18,941
We switched to another flight at the stopover, Abu Dhabi,

813
00:59:19,741 --> 00:59:22,791
so we were able to avoid this disaster.

814
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:24,022
Great job.

815
00:59:24,022 --> 00:59:27,352
- Father. 
 - Father.

816
00:59:31,721 --> 00:59:34,122
Father.

817
00:59:37,062 --> 00:59:39,662
What a relief, Father.

818
00:59:39,662 --> 00:59:42,571
I heard you had sudden appointment in Seoul.

819
00:59:42,571 --> 00:59:46,471
I don't know who it was, but I'd like to go bow to them.

820
00:59:46,471 --> 00:59:48,112
It's Youngjin Semiconductors.

821
00:59:48,112 --> 00:59:50,141
They're selling the business, right?

822
00:59:50,141 --> 00:59:52,381
I hear they will do it soon.

823
00:59:52,381 --> 00:59:55,582
I bought it today.

824
00:59:55,582 --> 00:59:57,082
Youngjin Semiconductors.

825
00:59:57,082 --> 00:59:58,582
- What? 
 - What?

826
00:59:58,582 --> 01:00:01,792
Wait, weren't you going to give up on the semiconductor business?

827
01:00:01,792 --> 01:00:05,161
Father, you're going to jump in on this fight of whales?

828
01:00:05,161 --> 01:00:08,662
I'm going to make the shrimp bigger

829
01:00:08,662 --> 01:00:11,632
so the shrimp won't die in a fight between whales.

830
01:00:11,632 --> 01:00:14,672
- Father. 
 - No matter how long it takes

831
01:00:14,672 --> 01:00:17,702
or how much I have to invest,

832
01:00:19,042 --> 01:00:22,471
I will make this shrimp as big as a whale.

833
01:00:22,471 --> 01:00:24,212
But Father, right now, it's not...

834
01:00:24,212 --> 01:00:27,281
I just came back from the dead.

835
01:00:27,852 --> 01:00:32,182
Do you think there is anything I'd be afraid of?

836
01:00:54,412 --> 01:00:56,511
   

837
01:01:04,582 --> 01:01:09,852
 I finally found out the answer to the quiz you asked, Grandpa. 

838
01:01:09,852 --> 01:01:13,191
 A way for a shrimp to beat the whales. 

839
01:01:13,191 --> 01:01:15,362
 It's to make the shrimp bigger. 

840
01:01:15,362 --> 01:01:18,762
 Then it won't die in the midst of a whales' fight. 

841
01:01:18,762 --> 01:01:23,672
 If you do not give up, time will be on the shrimp's side. 

842
01:01:23,672 --> 01:01:28,901
 The proposal for the buyout of Youngjin Semiconductors ends at 5 p.m. on the 29th. 

843
01:01:29,642 --> 01:01:31,611
 Once you see this note, 

844
01:01:31,611 --> 01:01:35,852
 I believe that you will change your flight. 

845
01:01:41,151 --> 01:01:42,821
Chairman.

846
01:01:45,062 --> 01:01:47,892
Are we stopping over at Abu Dhabi?

847
01:01:47,892 --> 01:01:49,361
Yes.

848
01:01:51,132 --> 01:01:55,002
Find the earliest flight to Seoul.

849
01:02:28,471 --> 01:02:32,571
Congratulations, President.

850
01:02:37,641 --> 01:02:40,811
During your presidency,

851
01:02:40,811 --> 01:02:47,311
please allow Soonyang to monopolize the semiconductor business.

852
01:02:50,662 --> 01:02:52,922
Thank you.

853
01:03:03,201 --> 01:03:05,071
Just as you said,

854
01:03:05,071 --> 01:03:09,372
I handed over the fund for the presidential election myself.

855
01:03:13,482 --> 01:03:18,582
Why did you tell me to fund

856
01:03:20,051 --> 01:03:23,192
the second and third runners who weren't going to make it?

857
01:03:23,192 --> 01:03:25,392
Once the first place graduates,

858
01:03:25,392 --> 01:03:28,742
there will come a day for the 2nd and 3rd to win. 
  (*In fact, both Kims would go on to become President.) 

859
01:03:34,071 --> 01:03:40,671
By any chance, do you know what the future holds?

860
01:03:50,112 --> 01:03:54,122
You knew that the agreement for a unified candidacy would fall under.

861
01:03:55,821 --> 01:03:59,622
You knew Roh Tae Woo would be elected.

862
01:04:01,991 --> 01:04:03,591
And...

863
01:04:09,301 --> 01:04:12,330
   

864
01:04:17,382 --> 01:04:20,542
you knew that CAL 828 was going to blow up.

865
01:04:22,852 --> 01:04:25,682
You knew everything.

866
01:04:27,091 --> 01:04:29,321
Is that true?

867
01:04:31,661 --> 01:04:34,021
Answer me!

868
01:04:47,942 --> 01:04:50,312
I did know.

869
01:04:53,951 --> 01:04:59,712
Not the future, but I knew what was in your heart.

870
01:05:02,221 --> 01:05:06,922
There is no way for a shrimp to win against whales.

871
01:05:06,922 --> 01:05:09,662
You gave me that quiz

872
01:05:09,662 --> 01:05:12,232
trying to grasp for straws because you knew

873
01:05:12,232 --> 01:05:14,982
your new attempt seemed reckless.

874
01:05:16,701 --> 01:05:18,801
You weren't looking for an answer.

875
01:05:18,801 --> 01:05:22,001
You were looking for approval and support.

876
01:05:23,611 --> 01:05:28,842
All I knew was how you felt in your heart.

877
01:05:40,792 --> 01:05:44,491
Why is he seeing him alone in the study?

878
01:05:44,491 --> 01:05:47,302
I mean, without Director Lee.

879
01:05:47,302 --> 01:05:50,431
- What's with Father? 
 - Tell me about it.

880
01:05:50,431 --> 01:05:53,302
That rarely happens for us, too.

881
01:05:54,712 --> 01:05:56,971
Young Ki.

882
01:06:01,212 --> 01:06:07,582
You got the answer, so you deserve the prize.

883
01:06:09,052 --> 01:06:10,592
How much do you want?

884
01:06:10,592 --> 01:06:13,292
I don't need money.

885
01:06:14,562 --> 01:06:19,962
Once I am old enough to use that money, its monetary value would have dropped.

886
01:06:21,801 --> 01:06:23,401
Is that so?

887
01:06:23,401 --> 01:06:25,242
I'd like land.

888
01:06:25,242 --> 01:06:29,642
A place with lots of plants and trees.

889
01:06:36,551 --> 01:06:39,852
I'd like this area, right here.

890
01:06:43,422 --> 01:06:47,461
That land was used to make pottery. It's useless.

891
01:06:47,461 --> 01:06:49,231
   

892
01:06:49,231 --> 01:06:50,502
    
     *Bundang started to be redeveloped in 1989 and is now a highly affluent neighbourhood. 

893
01:06:50,502 --> 01:06:53,152
Do you want the land in Bundang that badly?

894
01:06:56,371 --> 01:06:59,371
Let's see.

895
01:06:59,371 --> 01:07:01,341
How does 160,000m² sound?

896
01:07:01,341 --> 01:07:03,841
There is one more thing I'd like, Grandpa.

897
01:07:03,841 --> 01:07:07,211
I think I've rewarded you enough for answering my quiz.

898
01:07:10,852 --> 01:07:13,052
Then let's make it a deal.

899
01:07:19,792 --> 01:07:27,332
You need to have something that I do not have for a deal to be made.

900
01:07:27,332 --> 01:07:30,281
Do you think there is anything I do not have?

901
01:07:30,281 --> 01:07:33,172
Because you can't buy this with money.

902
01:07:34,442 --> 01:07:39,681
I'll bring you something that the Soonyang family doesn't have.

903
01:07:41,512 --> 01:07:46,252
The acceptance letter to the most prestigious college, Seoul National University, School of Law.

904
01:07:55,662 --> 01:07:57,792
You're right.

905
01:07:58,631 --> 01:08:01,531
An acceptance letter, I cannot buy that.

906
01:08:02,501 --> 01:08:04,702
Can you do this?

907
01:08:07,641 --> 01:08:10,472
What should I give you in return?

908
01:08:15,881 --> 01:08:18,382
Gather round, everyone.

909
01:08:32,202 --> 01:08:34,232
Jeong Rae.

910
01:08:34,232 --> 01:08:35,701
Yes, Father.

911
01:08:35,701 --> 01:08:38,541
Starting with the family gathering this weekend,

912
01:08:38,541 --> 01:08:45,072
make sure you set out enough utensils for Do Jun's family as well.

913
01:08:53,251 --> 01:08:55,252
Why won't you answer me?

914
01:08:55,252 --> 01:08:58,222
Every week?

915
01:08:58,222 --> 01:09:01,322
Do Jun here is my grandson.

916
01:09:02,091 --> 01:09:04,332
Do you understand now?

917
01:09:23,982 --> 01:09:25,751
 Family. 

918
01:09:28,421 --> 01:09:31,751
 4-alpha was right. 

919
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:34,721
 There must be a reason why I became part of this family. 

920
01:09:36,091 --> 01:09:39,441
 The reason why I became family with the Jins. 

921
01:09:42,801 --> 01:09:44,572
 Right here. 

922
01:09:48,971 --> 01:09:51,542
 One of these people 

923
01:09:55,912 --> 01:09:59,050
 killed me. 

924
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:14,960


925
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:19,872
How do you feel about entering SNU's law program as the top?

926
01:10:19,872 --> 01:10:21,511
Tell us your secret.

927
01:10:21,511 --> 01:10:24,511
How did you get in as the top of the class?

928
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:28,982
- Say something. 
 - Please introduce yourself.

929
01:10:29,912 --> 01:10:32,022
Well.

930
01:10:32,022 --> 01:10:36,692
I'm sure you all know my name.

931
01:10:36,692 --> 01:10:39,592
So is this what you're looking for?

932
01:10:41,091 --> 01:10:45,191
Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's grandson,

933
01:10:45,191 --> 01:10:49,501
College of Law, the class of 1996. My name is Jin Do Jun.

934
01:10:49,501 --> 01:10:51,941
 I was born as Jin Do Jun 

935
01:10:51,941 --> 01:10:54,912
 not as spirit possession, time traveling, 

936
01:10:54,912 --> 01:10:57,441
 nor reincarnation. 

937
01:10:57,441 --> 01:11:01,252
 This life is my opportunity. 

938
01:11:01,252 --> 01:11:04,020
   

939
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:09,450
♫  Come on, wake up, bring your destiny  ♫

940
01:11:09,450 --> 01:11:14,530
♫ Boy can't you see, deny your gravity ♫

941
01:11:14,530 --> 01:11:19,550
♫  I'm flying, throwing off the fetters  ♫

942
01:11:19,550 --> 01:11:24,980
♫  Boy can't you see, deny your gravity  ♫

943
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:30,950
♫  I can't stop the suffocating darkness  ♫

944
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:35,320
♫   I can't walk alone   ♫

945
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:37,222
Play. Have fun.

946
01:11:37,222 --> 01:11:41,452
 Go on group blind dates, regular blind dates, casual dates, and go out with someone. 

947
01:11:41,452 --> 01:11:43,552
 We've met before, right? 

948
01:11:43,552 --> 01:11:45,622
 Did you meet her? When? 

949
01:11:45,622 --> 01:11:46,762
 In 20 years' time. 

950
01:11:46,762 --> 01:11:49,691
 Do Jun, you're back! 

951
01:11:49,691 --> 01:11:52,461
 Why does Father play favorites with the youngest, Do Jun? 

952
01:11:52,461 --> 01:11:55,072
 Do Jun has exchanged the money in the account into dollars. 

953
01:11:55,072 --> 01:11:57,071
 I'd like to invest in companies in the US. 

954
01:11:57,071 --> 01:11:59,571
 Never bet on things that you aren't sure about. 

955
01:11:59,571 --> 01:12:01,272
 I have a lot of money, Mr. Oh. 

956
01:12:01,272 --> 01:12:02,471
 There is a problem. 

957
01:12:02,471 --> 01:12:03,872
 Just why? 

958
01:12:03,872 --> 01:12:05,982
 It's a foreign investment company. 

959
01:12:05,982 --> 01:12:10,841
 The chairman would like to pass Soonyang down to someone who is like him. 

960
01:12:10,841 --> 01:12:13,182
 Do you simply have good discernment? 

961
01:12:13,182 --> 01:12:15,120
 Or are you just lucky? 

962
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:20,050
♫  I'm flying, throwing off the fetters  ♫

963
01:12:20,050 --> 01:12:22,730
♫  Boy can't you see, deny your gravity  ♫
