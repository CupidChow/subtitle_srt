1
00:00:00,237 --> 00:00:04,707
 Korea's exports went up by over 30 percent in the first half of the year, 

2
00:00:04,707 --> 00:00:07,106
 which was the highest among the nation's major trading partners. 

3
00:00:07,106 --> 00:00:08,576
 People said 

4
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:11,147
 Korea had never been so prosperous since its very first kingdom was founded. 

5
00:00:11,147 --> 00:00:15,446
 People believed that the economy would continue to grow and that everyone would become richer. 

6
00:00:15,446 --> 00:00:17,186
 The Miracle on the Han River. 

7
00:00:17,186 --> 00:00:20,927
 No one doubted the nation's seemingly rosy future. 

8
00:00:20,927 --> 00:00:26,226
 The government has finally decided to seek financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund. 

9
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:29,196
 We should all scrimp and save. 
   

10
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,936
 We should share the burdens 

11
00:00:30,936 --> 00:00:33,136
 and overcome this crisis together at this difficult time. 

12
00:00:33,136 --> 00:00:35,406
 Upon admitting that the country is practically bankrupt, 

13
00:00:35,406 --> 00:00:37,277
 - the IMF...  
 - The country is bankrupt?

14
00:00:37,277 --> 00:00:40,006
 Until that day came. 

15
00:00:43,146 --> 00:00:47,416
Who knew a country could go bankrupt? This is unheard of!

16
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:51,856
 The world no one had ever experienced or imagined before. 

17
00:00:51,856 --> 00:00:54,826
In return for the 21 billion-dollar aid package,

18
00:00:54,826 --> 00:00:56,027
the IMF is requesting that

19
00:00:56,027 --> 00:00:57,896
Korea implements complete market opening, promotes labor market flexibility,

20
00:00:57,896 --> 00:01:00,697
- and reforms the conglomerates... 
 - Those scoundrels!

21
00:01:00,697 --> 00:01:03,147
Do they think we are their colony?

22
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:05,336
Their economic colony.

23
00:01:05,336 --> 00:01:07,836
They think they can strip us bare

24
00:01:07,836 --> 00:01:11,977
because they're giving us some money.

25
00:01:19,587 --> 00:01:21,347
So?

26
00:01:23,286 --> 00:01:26,556
What can we do to survive?

27
00:01:28,626 --> 00:01:31,670
 No one else in the country predicted this national crisis... 

28
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,870
   

29
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:40,796
 or prepared for it except for me. 

30
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:50,020


31
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,140
   

32
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,387
Please sign this.

33
00:01:57,387 --> 00:02:02,487
This agreement states that Mason Oh is the CEO of Miracle Investment.

34
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:09,827
I wanted to ask you something, Fellow Korean lad.

35
00:02:09,827 --> 00:02:13,547
The foreign exchange crisis. You knew about it, didn't you?

36
00:02:14,707 --> 00:02:18,607
You exchanged 24 billion won for US dollars, which is a lot of money.

37
00:02:18,607 --> 00:02:20,276
You came all the way to New York to meet me

38
00:02:20,276 --> 00:02:22,946
and made such a risky investment

39
00:02:22,946 --> 00:02:26,147
to earn US dollars in preparation for this day.

40
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:28,347
Right?

41
00:02:28,347 --> 00:02:30,987
Even Cheongwadae*, financial officers,
 (The Blue House: executive office and official residence of the president of South Korea) 

42
00:02:30,987 --> 00:02:34,886
and academic experts didn't see this coming. No one expected this.

43
00:02:34,886 --> 00:02:40,527
But you, a college student in his early twenties, saw it coming.

44
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:44,746
Don't you think it's odd?

45
00:02:44,746 --> 00:02:47,636
Your question was wrong, CEO Oh.

46
00:02:49,506 --> 00:02:52,936
Last year, Korea's foreign exchange reserves stood at 30 billion dollars,

47
00:02:52,936 --> 00:02:56,746
whereas its liabilities were measured at 170 billion dollars,

48
00:02:56,746 --> 00:03:00,017
which means that the country's credit rating has been dropping.

49
00:03:00,017 --> 00:03:04,367
The total amount of unpaid wages has surpassed 700 billion won  ($700M) .

50
00:03:06,226 --> 00:03:10,326
Even a young college student could see that a crisis was imminent.

51
00:03:10,326 --> 00:03:15,607
So how come those at Cheongwadae and the financial officers couldn't see that?

52
00:03:15,607 --> 00:03:18,166
Don't you think it's really odd?

53
00:03:22,137 --> 00:03:23,837
Good point.

54
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:28,277
Thanks to your foresight,

55
00:03:28,277 --> 00:03:32,776
you're now one of the people who holds the most US dollars in Korea.

56
00:03:32,776 --> 00:03:34,347
Congratulations.

57
00:03:35,647 --> 00:03:38,456
It's all part of Miracle Investment's assets.

58
00:03:38,456 --> 00:03:40,157
   

59
00:03:40,157 --> 00:03:42,757
"HW?"

60
00:03:42,757 --> 00:03:46,006
They're not your initials. What does that mean?

61
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,800
   

62
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,937
"HW?"

63
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:03,576
You're easier to read than I thought.

64
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,846
I know what it stands for. Howard Hughes. Right?

65
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:09,817
HW as in Howard.

66
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:11,787
He must be your role model.

67
00:04:11,787 --> 00:04:16,227
Right. Because you were born as a millionaire's heir, just like him?

68
00:04:16,227 --> 00:04:19,767
Or because he fashionably used his money and power

69
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:23,296
to get his hands on everything he wanted, all his life?

70
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:26,207
Well, I'd say it's both.

71
00:04:26,207 --> 00:04:27,707
All right, Howard.

72
00:04:27,707 --> 00:04:32,336
What's the first company Miracle Investment will acquire?

73
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:39,346
 They believe it could be resumed in the near future. 

74
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:42,486
 Ahjin Motors, Korea's second biggest automaker, 

75
00:04:42,486 --> 00:04:45,517
 has filed for court receivership. 

76
00:04:45,517 --> 00:04:49,356
 Unable to repay the loan of 4.5 trillion won ($4.5B) ,

77
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:51,606
 the company finally sank. 

78
00:04:52,596 --> 00:04:54,197
Do you want to buy Ahjin Motors?

79
00:04:54,197 --> 00:04:56,467
With all its debts?

80
00:04:56,467 --> 00:05:00,096
Hold on. No, right?

81
00:05:00,096 --> 00:05:04,906
You said you were after something bigger than Soonyang and something more desperate to get.

82
00:05:04,906 --> 00:05:07,837
Don't tell me it was Ahjin Motors.

83
00:05:07,837 --> 00:05:11,016
Why? Why on earth Ahjin?

84
00:05:11,716 --> 00:05:14,516
It suits our company.

85
00:05:14,516 --> 00:05:16,347
Miracle.

86
00:05:16,347 --> 00:05:17,716
Look.

87
00:05:19,257 --> 00:05:21,057
A miracle?

88
00:05:21,057 --> 00:05:23,997
Ahjin? Ahjin Motors, seriously?

89
00:05:29,767 --> 00:05:33,937
   

90
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,207
- Goodness. 
 - Let's go.

91
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:40,577
- We did our best. 
 - Let's get going.

92
00:05:40,577 --> 00:05:42,007
- Come on. 
 - Let's go.

93
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:44,377
- Curse you! 
 - You scumbags!

94
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:45,616
- Let's go. 
 - What should we do now?

95
00:05:45,616 --> 00:05:47,116
How am I going to earn a living?

96
00:05:47,116 --> 00:05:49,247
- Darn it. 
 - Gosh.

97
00:05:49,247 --> 00:05:52,716
- What do we do now? 
 - Seriously, what am I going to do?

98
00:05:55,457 --> 00:05:58,227
- Gosh. 
 - I can't believe this.

99
00:05:58,227 --> 00:06:02,266
   

100
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:03,297
   

101
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:08,266
   

102
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:13,806
 This year, prices will continue to rise 

103
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:16,326
 and more people will lose their jobs. 

104
00:06:16,326 --> 00:06:19,946
 Everyone's earnings will decrease, and more companies will go bankrupt. 

105
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:24,516
 All of us will have to shed a lot of sweat and tears 

106
00:06:26,957 --> 00:06:30,227
 while going through this difficult time. 

107
00:06:31,697 --> 00:06:34,067
He finally became President after three failed attempts, but for what?

108
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:37,036
He was handed a key to an empty shed.

109
00:06:37,036 --> 00:06:39,366
Goodness. How unlucky.

110
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:40,507
He will want to be remembered

111
00:06:40,507 --> 00:06:44,637
as the president who filled the shed and taught the rich a lesson.

112
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,606
They're calling this a breakfast meeting,

113
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,906
but clearly, they summoned all of us to discipline us.

114
00:06:48,906 --> 00:06:50,747
At this early hour...

115
00:06:50,747 --> 00:06:54,486
Anyway, do you sleep well these days?

116
00:06:54,486 --> 00:06:56,216
You know, Ahjin Motors' situation.

117
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:58,816
It could happen to us, too, you know.

118
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,197
Even Ahjin, the second biggest auto company, has collapsed.

119
00:07:04,197 --> 00:07:07,967
Will Soonyang Motors be all right?

120
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:11,696
After listening to you, I am concerned indeed.

121
00:07:11,696 --> 00:07:12,697
   

122
00:07:12,697 --> 00:07:15,406
Daeyoung Motors is the number one car company.

123
00:07:15,406 --> 00:07:19,277
The company should go global and bring in dollars if anything,

124
00:07:19,277 --> 00:07:23,607
but they're busy power-tripping in this small country.

125
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:28,987
Going global will be hard, right?

126
00:07:28,987 --> 00:07:32,156
Should Soonyang show you how it's done?

127
00:07:39,156 --> 00:07:42,706
Chairman Jin, you're surely way more magnanimous than I am.

128
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:46,336
Your younger son.

129
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,977
He came to me and said he wanted to take over Hando Steel.

130
00:07:50,977 --> 00:07:52,936
Had he been my son,

131
00:07:52,936 --> 00:07:56,877
I would've taught him a lesson and disowned him long ago.

132
00:07:56,877 --> 00:08:00,217
That brat dared to stab his brother in the back.

133
00:08:00,217 --> 00:08:03,446
But you protected him because he's your son.

134
00:08:05,456 --> 00:08:09,956
It certainly changed my opinion of you.

135
00:08:11,127 --> 00:08:14,567
- You... 
 - Mr. President is here.

136
00:08:21,507 --> 00:08:23,377
What does Cheongwadae think?

137
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,977
They didn't even bring up the IMF and company succession, right?

138
00:08:25,977 --> 00:08:28,827
Will they reform the conglomerate system?

139
00:08:28,827 --> 00:08:31,617
Do they want us to lose all our subsidiaries?

140
00:08:31,617 --> 00:08:34,717
Oh, right. I heard we might have to give up our private assets too.

141
00:08:34,717 --> 00:08:37,287
That won't happen, right?

142
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:39,516
Did you already agree to everything?

143
00:08:39,516 --> 00:08:42,556
- Father. 
 - Dong Ki!

144
00:08:43,497 --> 00:08:45,297
You...

145
00:08:57,377 --> 00:08:59,906
Cheongwadae seemed determined.

146
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:05,306
They plan to restructure the major corporations, and Soonyang won't be an exception.

147
00:09:11,316 --> 00:09:15,526
What will Cheongwadae do about Ahjin Motors?

148
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,796
The company will gather more debt if they sit on the issue.

149
00:09:19,796 --> 00:09:21,497
Then no one would want to acquire the company.

150
00:09:21,497 --> 00:09:24,137
The domestic automotive industry is suffering big time.

151
00:09:24,137 --> 00:09:25,936
Who would be willing to acquire Ahjin Motors?

152
00:09:25,936 --> 00:09:28,967
Who would be crazy enough to do that unless they were shot in the head?

153
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:30,777
Me.

154
00:09:32,336 --> 00:09:34,906
Ahjin Motors.

155
00:09:34,906 --> 00:09:37,517
Soonyang will buy the company.

156
00:09:37,517 --> 00:09:40,787
Father, do you wish to buy Ahjin with all that's going on?

157
00:09:40,787 --> 00:09:44,886
If a businessman sits in a safe zone and doesn't budge, his butt will rot.

158
00:09:44,886 --> 00:09:49,127
Father, the interest on their loan is 30 percent.

159
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:50,857
Ahjin has nothing but debts.

160
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:52,696
Do you want to volunteer to take care of the bomb?

161
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:55,367
At the moment, we should focus on maintaining Soonyang Motors...

162
00:09:55,367 --> 00:09:58,217
Cheongwadae wishes to restructure everything.

163
00:09:59,367 --> 00:10:02,917
And as you guys said, the domestic automotive industry is dead.

164
00:10:05,436 --> 00:10:09,347
Why don't you understand what this means?

165
00:10:09,347 --> 00:10:11,416
Ahjin Motors isn't the bomb,

166
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,316
Soonyang Motors is.

167
00:10:13,316 --> 00:10:17,166
The worst-performing automaker in the country, Soonyang Motors!

168
00:10:21,987 --> 00:10:24,656
Taking over Ahjin Motors?

169
00:10:24,656 --> 00:10:26,797
It's not a choice.

170
00:10:26,797 --> 00:10:29,017
We must do it to survive.

171
00:10:29,936 --> 00:10:31,767
To survive.

172
00:10:32,436 --> 00:10:34,007
Okay?

173
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,367
Do you understand?

174
00:10:40,177 --> 00:10:43,676
   

175
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:53,086
Your grandfather, Chairman Jin.

176
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:57,187
He'll be determined to acquire Ahjin Motors.

177
00:10:57,187 --> 00:11:00,367
Because it's the only way to protect Soonyang Motors.

178
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:04,697
Acquiring Ahjin Motors, the number two company in the industry, means their market dominance will go up.

179
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:09,006
And if they share the production lines, they can reduce costs too.

180
00:11:09,006 --> 00:11:14,476
Most importantly, they'd have to grow Soonyang Motors... to avoid restructuring.

181
00:11:14,476 --> 00:11:16,177
   

182
00:11:19,377 --> 00:11:21,687
That being said, Fellow Korean lad,

183
00:11:24,757 --> 00:11:29,557
if I were one of those people at Cheongwadae,

184
00:11:29,557 --> 00:11:32,557
I would give Ahjin Motors to Chairman Jin.

185
00:11:32,557 --> 00:11:37,897
Not a new investment firm like us, with no experience in management whatsoever.

186
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,236
Are you confident?

187
00:11:39,236 --> 00:11:41,806
Are you sure we won't lose Ahjin Motors to Soonyang?

188
00:11:41,806 --> 00:11:45,556
I assure you that Soonyang will never acquire Ahjin Motors.

189
00:11:48,747 --> 00:11:54,747
They'll soon realize that they've fallen prey to the winner's curse.

190
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,817
The internal reserves?

191
00:11:59,817 --> 00:12:02,827
- All of it? 
 - Yes.

192
00:12:02,827 --> 00:12:08,896
The bidding war over Hando Steel... was extremely fierce, Father.

193
00:12:08,897 --> 00:12:14,597
With the foreign exchange differences soaring, we had unexpected expenses, Sir.

194
00:12:17,277 --> 00:12:19,077
What can we do?

195
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:22,256
Try to take out a loan from a bank.

196
00:12:22,877 --> 00:12:28,716
We've maxed out our limits at all the major banks, so taking out any additional loan will be difficult, Sir.

197
00:12:32,857 --> 00:12:35,357
Is that also because of Hando Steel?

198
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:37,796
Yes, Sir.

199
00:12:44,436 --> 00:12:46,986
Our real estate holdings.

200
00:12:46,986 --> 00:12:48,837
Let's sell them.

201
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:53,936
The thing is, we already used the valuable ones...

202
00:12:53,936 --> 00:12:57,077
- as collateral to take out... 
 - So?

203
00:12:57,077 --> 00:13:00,987
Are you saying we can't afford to acquire Ahjin Motors?

204
00:13:01,887 --> 00:13:03,917
I'm sorry, Father.

205
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:11,627
We wouldn't have had any problems without the financial crisis.

206
00:13:11,627 --> 00:13:16,396
If only Dong Ki hadn't urged the chairman of Daeyoung to increase the bid for Hando Steel...

207
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,467
Father, I was just...

208
00:13:18,467 --> 00:13:20,466
Enough, both of you!

209
00:13:24,536 --> 00:13:27,876
It's all my fault.

210
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,276
Father.

211
00:13:33,017 --> 00:13:34,817
Hang Jae.

212
00:13:40,426 --> 00:13:42,087
Yes, Sir.

213
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:49,357
These are my sons.

214
00:13:55,866 --> 00:13:58,436
   

215
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,126
Mr. Jin Seong Jun?

216
00:14:22,826 --> 00:14:25,076
You're waiting for your secretary, right?

217
00:14:26,637 --> 00:14:28,866
They'll be a bit late.

218
00:14:29,737 --> 00:14:34,137
Yes, sorry! Oh, boy.

219
00:14:34,137 --> 00:14:36,046
Sorry. We apologize.

220
00:14:36,046 --> 00:14:38,317
- We're sorry. 
 - My gosh.

221
00:14:38,317 --> 00:14:39,747
You guys.

222
00:14:39,747 --> 00:14:42,786
- You can't block the road! 
 - We're sorry.

223
00:14:42,786 --> 00:14:44,857
- Sorry, we'll hurry. 
 - I'm very busy right now!

224
00:14:44,857 --> 00:14:48,227
They're getting stalled.

225
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:54,757
Our suitcases got switched at the airport, so we meet by fate

226
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:57,737
and leave a deep impression on each other. That's the story.

227
00:14:57,737 --> 00:15:01,467
- Before our families set us up officially. 
 - "We?"

228
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:04,066
Jin Seong Jun, the Soonyang family's eldest grandson,

229
00:15:04,066 --> 00:15:07,747
and Mo Hyeon Min, the only daughter of the Hyunsung Daily family.

230
00:15:07,747 --> 00:15:09,147
Us.

231
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:14,417
Hearing that you'd be turned off by marriage talks between the two families,

232
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:19,617
my family came up with this idea in a rush because they really want to marry me off to your family.

233
00:15:19,617 --> 00:15:24,086
You're showing me all your cards. Then this game will be no fun.

234
00:15:25,956 --> 00:15:31,527
In your third year of college, you took "Understanding Classic British and American Literature." C minus.

235
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:33,916
That was your grade, right?

236
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,536
As expected, you have poor comprehension skills.

237
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:39,536
I'm trying to tell you that we should turn the tables.

238
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:49,816
You look as though you're thinking, "Where did this nutjob come from?"

239
00:15:50,987 --> 00:15:53,537
You have good comprehension skills.

240
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:55,826
Yes, as you can see and feel.

241
00:15:55,826 --> 00:15:58,956
Tell the elders in your family.

242
00:15:58,956 --> 00:16:03,866
I love myself too much to bet my future on you just because you're from the Soonyang family.

243
00:16:03,866 --> 00:16:05,997
Why can't you take care of it yourself?

244
00:16:05,997 --> 00:16:09,707
My family isn't really in a position to turn it down.

245
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:22,917
You look better in person. I guess you're not photogenic.

246
00:16:44,007 --> 00:16:47,107
I'm sorry, Sir. Did I keep you waiting long?

247
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:50,747
You may not believe it, but some stupid newspaper delivery truck...

248
00:16:50,747 --> 00:16:53,687
Of course, I believe you. It was Hyunsung Daily, right?

249
00:16:53,687 --> 00:16:55,417
Oh, how did you know?

250
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:58,086
Let's go. The elders must be waiting.

251
00:16:58,086 --> 00:16:59,917
Yes, Sir.

252
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:07,627
- Grandma. 
 - Oh, my.

253
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:10,997
My gosh. You did it, Sweetheart.

254
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:13,537
It must've been so hard.

255
00:17:13,537 --> 00:17:17,177
You lived on hamburgers while studying in that faraway country.

256
00:17:17,177 --> 00:17:19,376
You've lost weight.

257
00:17:19,376 --> 00:17:21,747
No. I gained 5 kg, Grandma.

258
00:17:21,747 --> 00:17:23,207
It's just water weight.

259
00:17:23,207 --> 00:17:25,447
You're swollen because you haven't been eating well.

260
00:17:25,447 --> 00:17:28,386
Jeong Rae, what are you waiting for? Our eldest grandson must be hungry.

261
00:17:28,386 --> 00:17:30,687
- Let's feed him first. 
 - Okay.

262
00:17:30,687 --> 00:17:33,957
Mother, he should go say hello to Father first.

263
00:17:33,957 --> 00:17:36,997
- All right. 
 - Grandfather is in his study, right?

264
00:17:36,997 --> 00:17:38,857
Yes, that's right.

265
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:41,127
- Go on. 
 - I'll be right back.

266
00:17:52,737 --> 00:17:55,746
Grandpa. It's me, Seong Jun.

267
00:17:55,746 --> 00:17:57,547
 I'm coming in. 

268
00:18:03,987 --> 00:18:05,887
You're back!

269
00:18:08,056 --> 00:18:12,957
Oh, my. Yes, welcome back.

270
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,296
Let me take a look at you.

271
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:20,067
My gosh, look at you.

272
00:18:21,237 --> 00:18:28,106
You've done well finishing up the studies you always dreaded doing.

273
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:30,147
My eldest grandson.

274
00:18:30,147 --> 00:18:32,247
My true studies begin now.

275
00:18:32,247 --> 00:18:36,047
I'll stand right by your side to learn each and everything I must know.

276
00:18:36,047 --> 00:18:42,557
Good. Let's wait and see how you earn your keep, my eldest grandson.

277
00:18:43,626 --> 00:18:45,296
Good.

278
00:18:45,296 --> 00:18:48,427
Go get some rest. You must be tired from traveling.

279
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:49,967
Okay.

280
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:57,266
Seong Jun, you are... the pillar of our family.

281
00:18:59,376 --> 00:19:03,676
So you can get married with the same attitude.

282
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,877
Do you understand?

283
00:19:05,877 --> 00:19:09,346
You must have found a suitable candidate, Grandfather.

284
00:19:11,616 --> 00:19:14,657
Okay. Go on now.

285
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:25,997
She doesn't look like the type who would cherish her husband.

286
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:29,306
And especially not the type who'd be serving her in-laws.

287
00:19:29,306 --> 00:19:32,636
While I was gone, you've mastered the art of discerning characters.

288
00:19:32,636 --> 00:19:34,706
Goodness. Hey.

289
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:39,947
If your father hadn't fallen out of your grandfather's favor, I wouldn't let you go into this marriage.

290
00:19:41,687 --> 00:19:45,656
Do I have to end up humoring my daughter-in-law too?

291
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:48,987
Look at this girl.

292
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:51,896
Nothing about her says that she's easygoing.

293
00:19:51,896 --> 00:19:53,757
Look at this.

294
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:55,596
I don't have to look at her photo.

295
00:19:55,596 --> 00:19:58,397
Right? Isn't that right?

296
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:01,737
Do you want to ask Grandfather for another suitable girl?

297
00:20:01,737 --> 00:20:02,767
- Mother. 
 - Yes?

298
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:05,367
I need to get changed and get some rest.

299
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:09,207
Oh my. What am I thinking?

300
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:12,177
I'm here talking to you while you're still jetlagged.

301
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:16,546
Hey, it's all because of your impetuous grandfather.

302
00:20:16,546 --> 00:20:18,357
Get a good rest.

303
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:42,176
Since when did Seoul become so fun without my permission?

304
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:56,986
   

305
00:20:56,986 --> 00:20:59,196
   

306
00:21:00,497 --> 00:21:01,727
Sir.

307
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:05,466
A foreign investment company stepped in to take Ahjin Motors over.

308
00:21:05,466 --> 00:21:07,267
A foreign investment company?

309
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:13,707
They're named Miracle Investment, independently established by Oh Se Hyeon, formerly with Power Shares.

310
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:16,007
Oh Se Hyeon of Power Shares?

311
00:21:16,007 --> 00:21:17,706
Yes, Sir.

312
00:21:20,217 --> 00:21:22,417
Oh Se Hyeon wants...

313
00:21:23,346 --> 00:21:24,917
Ahjin Motors?

314
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:26,917
Pay our overdue wages!

315
00:21:26,917 --> 00:21:28,987
- Pay us! 
 - Pay us!

316
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,757
We demand our job security!

317
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:31,896
 - We demand! 
 - We demand! 

318
00:21:31,896 --> 00:21:33,896
Koreans are so weird.

319
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:36,566
Boss, I seriously don't understand.

320
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:39,737
The settlement with the IMF is already over, isn't it?

321
00:21:39,737 --> 00:21:44,807
In return for the relief loan, they'll introduce the layoff system and hire non-regular employees.

322
00:21:44,807 --> 00:21:49,747
What will change by them waving flags and chanting some words?

323
00:21:49,747 --> 00:21:52,846
Some of them may be waiting for a consolation game.

324
00:21:52,846 --> 00:21:54,817
A consolation game?

325
00:21:54,817 --> 00:21:56,517
Who is?

326
00:21:56,517 --> 00:22:00,826
   

327
00:22:04,527 --> 00:22:06,227
My name is Song Hyun Chang.

328
00:22:06,227 --> 00:22:07,626
What an unexpected pleasure.

329
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:10,636
I did not expect to see you at the factory, Chairman.

330
00:22:10,636 --> 00:22:14,486
As things are quite sensitive with the labor union right now.

331
00:22:14,486 --> 00:22:16,366
Please take a seat.

332
00:22:17,576 --> 00:22:20,276
   

333
00:22:23,747 --> 00:22:29,616
I am not... sitting here as Song Hyun Chang, the chairman of Ahjin Motors.

334
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:35,656
I am looking for a partner who'll save our company as the representative of our entire staff.

335
00:22:35,656 --> 00:22:39,496
Those are truly the words of an engineer who became the CEO.

336
00:22:39,496 --> 00:22:42,467
Just like Iacocca of an American automobile company.

337
00:22:42,467 --> 00:22:45,796
A major shareholder of Miracle Investment asked me to pass this on to you.

338
00:22:45,796 --> 00:22:51,307
He said it'll be impossible for Iacocca to turn down our offer.

339
00:23:09,027 --> 00:23:10,487
Hello.

340
00:23:10,487 --> 00:23:12,627
Hello, Mr. Ha.

341
00:23:13,757 --> 00:23:14,927
Could I have the car key, please?

342
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:18,337
Goodness, how could I? Allow me to escort you.

343
00:23:18,337 --> 00:23:20,236
Please.

344
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,767
CEO Jin Dong Ki.

345
00:23:26,737 --> 00:23:31,347
I don't want my second uncle to know where I'm going right now.

346
00:23:37,517 --> 00:23:39,856
Did you know?

347
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,786
How could I not know?

348
00:23:43,457 --> 00:23:49,297
You are the type who stands out for your diligence, Mr. Ha.

349
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:54,237
What will happen to me from now on?

350
00:23:55,036 --> 00:23:57,206
That's your choice.

351
00:23:57,206 --> 00:23:59,676
I'll comply with your decision.

352
00:23:59,676 --> 00:24:01,306
Until then,

353
00:24:03,546 --> 00:24:05,816
you're on a break.

354
00:24:49,157 --> 00:24:52,007
   

355
00:24:54,766 --> 00:24:57,340
   

356
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:03,340
♫  Because this long night is so dark  ♫

357
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:08,440
♫  When I feel alone  ♫

358
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:16,050
♫  When I want to collapse at times like that  ♫

359
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:20,150
♫  When everyone in the world turned their back on me  ♫

360
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:25,860
♫  And abandoned me, even in those times  ♫

361
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,796
♫  Always with the same helping hands you raised me up,   ♫

362
00:25:28,796 --> 00:25:32,620
   

363
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,660
♫  Because you are here  ♫

364
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:38,337
   

365
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:41,960
♫  I won't be afraid  ♫

366
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,810
♫  Any flower, anything in the world  ♫

367
00:25:45,816 --> 00:25:49,480
   
  &gt;/i&gt; 

368
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,340
♫  There is but one person in the universe  ♫

369
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:58,057
   

370
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:02,057
   

371
00:26:02,057 --> 00:26:09,160
♫  You are wonderful to me  ♫

372
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:11,390
Well, it happened.

373
00:26:13,066 --> 00:26:16,140
After all, everyone is having a tough time in this economy.

374
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:19,200
♫  Mom  ♫

375
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,316
   

376
00:26:27,316 --> 00:26:29,827
   

377
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,757
Excuse me.

378
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:40,896
May I eat?

379
00:26:46,407 --> 00:26:48,646
You must've come often.

380
00:26:48,646 --> 00:26:53,347
Only our regulars know that I make kimchi soup.

381
00:26:54,017 --> 00:26:57,946
Goodness, you must be cold.

382
00:26:57,946 --> 00:27:01,556
It'll get warm soon. I just lit the stove.

383
00:27:06,326 --> 00:27:08,967
Do you not eat raw eggs?

384
00:27:10,467 --> 00:27:13,236
You're just like my son.

385
00:27:16,507 --> 00:27:18,336
Honey.

386
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:22,247
Oh my. You had a customer.

387
00:27:22,247 --> 00:27:24,247
Flowers?

388
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:27,377
Just because.

389
00:27:27,377 --> 00:27:29,046
We can't afford flowers.

390
00:27:29,046 --> 00:27:31,947
We need every dollar we can get.

391
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:37,386
Did you look for a new job?

392
00:27:40,196 --> 00:27:41,896
   

393
00:27:41,896 --> 00:27:43,896
Honey, what have you been up to?

394
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:45,267
Have you still not given up?

395
00:27:45,267 --> 00:27:47,536
Try to remember the last time you were paid.

396
00:27:47,536 --> 00:27:49,806
You aren't going to get paid for wearing your union vest.

397
00:27:49,806 --> 00:27:54,077
If you go out to leisurely sing and wave your arms around,

398
00:27:54,077 --> 00:27:56,707
will they pay for Hyeon Woo's tuition?

399
00:27:56,707 --> 00:27:58,777
Don't worry about it.

400
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:01,717
Things will get better for our company very soon.

401
00:28:01,717 --> 00:28:05,317
If Ahjin Motors goes down, Korea goes down, too.

402
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:07,767
The government won't let it happen.

403
00:28:07,767 --> 00:28:10,027
It's gone down.

404
00:28:10,027 --> 00:28:14,827
The Korea you trusted so much has gone down.

405
00:28:17,566 --> 00:28:21,837
So you need to find a way to save yourself.

406
00:28:21,837 --> 00:28:27,867
What did I do so wrong?

407
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:30,846
After I graduated from school when I was eighteen,

408
00:28:30,846 --> 00:28:35,916
I got a job here at Ahjin and worked so hard for thirty years.

409
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:39,016
You know that best.

410
00:28:39,016 --> 00:28:41,957
I'm a metal coating technician, a maintenance engineer, and an electrical engineer.

411
00:28:41,957 --> 00:28:46,996
I'm a master technician as approved by Ahjin.

412
00:28:46,996 --> 00:28:51,066
So what did I do so wrong

413
00:28:51,066 --> 00:28:55,437
to be this idiot who can't even buy flowers for my wife,

414
00:28:55,437 --> 00:28:59,976
who had a tough life, running a restaurant and raising our boy?

415
00:29:02,177 --> 00:29:04,306
Why should I?

416
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:22,527
 A head of a family with my own wife and children? 

417
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:26,966
 Is that how you lived as a dignified head of the family? 

418
00:29:26,967 --> 00:29:30,507
 Father, do you have the right to say that to me? 

419
00:29:45,257 --> 00:29:48,957
   

420
00:29:48,957 --> 00:29:51,056
   

421
00:29:58,236 --> 00:29:59,237
   

422
00:29:59,237 --> 00:30:03,467
Miracle Investment would like to guarantee the retention of the employees

423
00:30:03,467 --> 00:30:07,836
as well as the managerial rights for you, Chairman Song. 
    

424
00:30:11,717 --> 00:30:14,517
Please remain as Iacocca.

425
00:30:14,517 --> 00:30:18,916
The man who became a legend for saving Chrysler from bankruptcy.

426
00:30:20,517 --> 00:30:22,626
Just like that man, Iacocca.

427
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,920
   

428
00:30:44,247 --> 00:30:47,517
 The ceremony will be over in thirty minutes. 

429
00:30:47,517 --> 00:30:53,117
 You are to find him wherever he went and bring him to me. 

430
00:31:20,947 --> 00:31:23,946
I'm guessing you recognize me.

431
00:31:25,457 --> 00:31:30,356
It's fine. I also recognized you at one glance.

432
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:34,397
The youngest grandson of Soonyang's chairman, Jin Yang Cheol.

433
00:31:34,397 --> 00:31:36,047
That's you, right?

434
00:31:40,836 --> 00:31:45,437
I'm not sure what you were told, but there's no need to stare like that.

435
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:47,576
You're embarrassing me.

436
00:32:09,126 --> 00:32:15,496
Anyone can see that you were in a hurry to get somewhere important.

437
00:32:27,717 --> 00:32:29,846
Politicians and prominent figures of the society

438
00:32:29,846 --> 00:32:31,356
have taken part in the gold-collecting campaign,

439
00:32:31,356 --> 00:32:34,487
setting an example to overcome this national crisis.

440
00:32:34,487 --> 00:32:38,126
 Today is the fiftieth day of the gold-collecting and exporting campaign. 

441
00:32:38,126 --> 00:32:41,566
 The people united their hearts to save the country. 

442
00:32:41,566 --> 00:32:45,726
 On the other hand, the amount of gold collected reached 130 tons as of today. 

443
00:32:45,726 --> 00:32:48,407
 This year alone, gold export has brought in two billion dollars. 

444
00:32:48,407 --> 00:32:50,937
 This is a fivefold of trade surplus, 

445
00:32:50,937 --> 00:32:54,477
 reaching over ten billion dollars of unexpected profit. 

446
00:32:54,477 --> 00:32:57,306
 Today was a confirmation of the great patriotism 

447
00:32:57,306 --> 00:33:00,406
 which even brought change to macroeconomics. 

448
00:33:01,176 --> 00:33:03,386
Thank you.

449
00:33:03,386 --> 00:33:05,856
- Ms. Lee Hae In! 
 - Ms. Lee Hae In!

450
00:33:05,856 --> 00:33:08,257
- Ms. Lee Hae In! 
 - Please look over here.

451
00:33:08,257 --> 00:33:10,826
- Why did you take part in this? 
 - Ms. Lee Hae In!

452
00:33:10,826 --> 00:33:13,296
- Look over here. 
 - Over here too!

453
00:33:13,296 --> 00:33:14,696
- Please look here. 
 - Ms. Lee Hae In!

454
00:33:14,696 --> 00:33:16,566
   

455
00:33:16,566 --> 00:33:18,666
When times are tough for our country,

456
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:21,737
I learned that is is our duty, at the least, to show an effort

457
00:33:21,737 --> 00:33:25,537
That was the valuable teaching of my mother-in-law.

458
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:28,146
- Another word, please. 
 - Ms. Lee Hae In!

459
00:33:28,146 --> 00:33:30,546
- Please say something too! 
 - Ms. Lee, over here.

460
00:33:30,546 --> 00:33:32,816
- Look over here. 
 - Please look here.

461
00:33:32,816 --> 00:33:34,516
- Ms. Lee. 
 - Over here.

462
00:33:34,516 --> 00:33:36,387
- Anything else? 
 - Look over here.

463
00:33:36,387 --> 00:33:37,586
- Please look here. 
 - Please add another word.

464
00:33:37,586 --> 00:33:41,386
That is why all of us decided to take part in this campaign.

465
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:44,456
- Ms. Lee Hae In! 
 - Hae In, over here!

466
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:47,396
- Hae In! 
 - How do you think it'll turn out?

467
00:33:47,396 --> 00:33:49,467
- Anything else to say? 
 - Ms. Lee!

468
00:33:49,467 --> 00:33:52,737
- Please look over here. 
 - Over here too.

469
00:33:57,566 --> 00:33:59,616
- Hello. 
 - You're here.

470
00:34:01,577 --> 00:34:03,706
The news of your wife and daughters-in-law...

471
00:34:03,706 --> 00:34:05,916
taking part in the gold-collecting campaign...

472
00:34:05,916 --> 00:34:10,417
will be reported on the front page as the top news for Hyunsung Daily tomorrow.

473
00:34:10,417 --> 00:34:13,557
This story will become a great catalyst in the campaign

474
00:34:13,557 --> 00:34:17,207
since the participation began to subside, Chairman Jin.

475
00:34:17,207 --> 00:34:19,396
Why don't you put out a huge photo instead?

476
00:34:19,396 --> 00:34:22,266
Not a lot of words.

477
00:34:22,266 --> 00:34:27,566
I hear one photo is more powerful than ten words.

478
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:31,137
You are such a wise man, Chairman Jin.

479
00:34:31,137 --> 00:34:38,676
It wasn't me. It's from my eldest grandson, whom I wish to marry into your family.

480
00:34:42,487 --> 00:34:45,986
So? Will he be a good match for her?

481
00:34:52,527 --> 00:34:54,427
I'm sorry. I'm late.

482
00:34:54,427 --> 00:34:58,696
Speak of the devil. My humble daughter, Chairman Jin.

483
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:00,766
Hello.

484
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:03,366
- Take a seat. 
 - Yes.

485
00:35:15,316 --> 00:35:17,916
I'm glad.

486
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:22,916
First, let's write up the paperwork for the acquisition of Ahjin Motors.

487
00:35:23,787 --> 00:35:25,596
Okay.

488
00:35:30,527 --> 00:35:33,436
Seong Jun, come over here.

489
00:35:33,436 --> 00:35:35,396
Yes, Grandfather.

490
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:43,776
Did you want me, Grandfather?

491
00:35:43,776 --> 00:35:48,916
Yes, you should meet her.

492
00:35:54,257 --> 00:35:56,527
How do you do?

493
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,907
My name is Jin Seong Jun.

494
00:36:01,907 --> 00:36:04,366
My name is Mo Hyeon Min.

495
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:11,967
You must leave now.

496
00:36:25,186 --> 00:36:26,816
I'm late, Grandfather.

497
00:36:26,816 --> 00:36:29,086
Hey, Do Jun.

498
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:30,486
Yes?

499
00:36:30,486 --> 00:36:34,496
Do you still invest with Oh Se Hyeon as your proxy?

500
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:40,137
You already know.

501
00:36:40,137 --> 00:36:43,406
Mr. Oh and I have different views on investing.

502
00:36:43,406 --> 00:36:45,077
We split up a while ago.

503
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:49,436
That Oh Se Hyeon is trying to take over Ahjin Motors.

504
00:36:49,436 --> 00:36:51,807
Did you know about this?

505
00:36:54,816 --> 00:36:58,947
Are you worried that he will become a hindrance to Soonyang Motors?

506
00:36:58,947 --> 00:37:01,456
He acts smart, but he's foolish.

507
00:37:01,456 --> 00:37:05,277
He plays the money game but knows nothing about business.

508
00:37:05,277 --> 00:37:07,456
What now? Employee retention?

509
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:10,296
- Is that what he's doing? 
 - Yes, Sir.

510
00:37:10,296 --> 00:37:12,867
How does that make any sense?

511
00:37:12,867 --> 00:37:16,196
Do Jun, there is nothing for you to learn from this.

512
00:37:16,196 --> 00:37:18,506
Do not associate with him.

513
00:37:23,046 --> 00:37:27,516
Why are you so against the employmee retention?

514
00:37:33,186 --> 00:37:34,787
Doesn't it benefit the company

515
00:37:34,787 --> 00:37:38,597
if productivity rises through peace between the union and management?

516
00:37:38,597 --> 00:37:45,097
You always told me about righteous management, and I thought that was it.

517
00:37:55,947 --> 00:37:58,816
When you bring up a servant,

518
00:37:58,816 --> 00:38:01,376
you mustn't give him great housing and a full stomach.

519
00:38:01,376 --> 00:38:03,987
Do you know why?

520
00:38:07,987 --> 00:38:11,137
Because he will begin to think he's the master

521
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:17,327
Layoffs are not a big deal.

522
00:38:17,327 --> 00:38:21,896
It clearly shows them who their true master is.

523
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:25,367
Righteous management?

524
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:31,107
To me, money is righteousness.

525
00:38:50,797 --> 00:38:54,990
   

526
00:39:07,216 --> 00:39:11,987
You're a big man now, Do Jun.

527
00:39:12,987 --> 00:39:16,637
I'd just pass you by if I met you on the street.

528
00:39:16,637 --> 00:39:19,027
I would recognize you.

529
00:39:21,427 --> 00:39:23,196
 Sir! 

530
00:39:27,237 --> 00:39:29,687
You have an unforgettable face.

531
00:39:32,606 --> 00:39:39,856
I heard you got into SNU law at the top of the class, and you quite look like a law student.

532
00:39:42,017 --> 00:39:46,086
Justice. Righteousness.

533
00:39:46,086 --> 00:39:48,507
You must fancy such values.

534
00:39:50,226 --> 00:39:55,257
I'm glad that you have no interest in running the company.

535
00:40:06,106 --> 00:40:11,277
Did you say his youngest grandson is a student at SNU's law school?

536
00:40:11,277 --> 00:40:13,446
He's not just a student there.

537
00:40:13,446 --> 00:40:15,347
He got in at the top of his class.

538
00:40:15,347 --> 00:40:17,070
Chairman Jin must've been so thrilled.

539
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:21,710
That Scrooge of a man gave him 160,000m² of land in Bundang.

540
00:40:21,717 --> 00:40:24,276
Think of how much that's worth.

541
00:40:25,896 --> 00:40:27,456
Land in Bundang?

542
00:40:27,456 --> 00:40:32,966
Before the urban planning began, his youngest grandson picked Bundang.

543
00:40:32,966 --> 00:40:34,367
See?

544
00:40:34,367 --> 00:40:37,867
A family that's blessed with money is different.

545
00:40:39,177 --> 00:40:40,907
Why do you ask?

546
00:40:40,907 --> 00:40:44,706
I'm guessing you find this marriage intriguing.

547
00:40:57,387 --> 00:41:03,397
Why don't we change the story with a different male lead?

548
00:41:15,777 --> 00:41:19,416
   

549
00:41:19,416 --> 00:41:23,646
I'll take Vienna coffee.

550
00:41:23,646 --> 00:41:26,286
One Vienna coffee, no cinnamon powder.

551
00:41:26,286 --> 00:41:29,987
You order this every single day, 365 days a year.

552
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:33,256
You come by without missing a day, and it's always that item.

553
00:41:33,256 --> 00:41:35,927
Tomorrow at 8 a.m., Main Library.

554
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:37,766
I like to sit by the window.

555
00:41:37,766 --> 00:41:40,116
Your coffee is on me today.

556
00:41:42,907 --> 00:41:46,436
Why? Did you think I didn't know?

557
00:41:46,436 --> 00:41:50,146
You come by every single day because of me.

558
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:53,576
Me?

559
00:41:54,516 --> 00:41:56,987
Listen to this guy. Yes, you.

560
00:41:56,987 --> 00:41:59,316
Of all times, when I am working alone,

561
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:02,456
you come only during my shift every day without exception .

562
00:42:02,456 --> 00:42:05,956
Then order this calorie-loaded Vienna coffee without skipping a day.

563
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:09,527
How else would you explain this cliche story?

564
00:42:11,197 --> 00:42:14,166
You could probably drink about twelve of these

565
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:18,137
with the points you've accumulated.

566
00:42:18,876 --> 00:42:20,736
Really?

567
00:42:22,577 --> 00:42:24,546
I see.

568
00:42:27,416 --> 00:42:34,617
Wait, are you saying you liked Vienna coffee, not me?

569
00:42:34,617 --> 00:42:36,086
Seriously?

570
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:37,957
I really didn't know.

571
00:42:37,957 --> 00:42:42,597
I can start using the points next time I come.

572
00:42:42,597 --> 00:42:44,697
All right!

573
00:42:45,697 --> 00:42:50,107
Right, did you say you like to sit by the window?

574
00:42:50,867 --> 00:42:53,077
I'll save a seat for you at the library.

575
00:42:53,077 --> 00:42:57,347
You look very tired from working your part-time job.

576
00:42:58,106 --> 00:43:01,106
See you tomorrow. Thanks for the coffee.

577
00:43:07,186 --> 00:43:11,427
Did you just see him ask me out?

578
00:43:11,427 --> 00:43:14,857
I think you're the one who asked him out.

579
00:43:39,616 --> 00:43:41,657
   

580
00:43:41,657 --> 00:43:44,126
What did you say?

581
00:43:44,126 --> 00:43:46,427
What do you mean? At this point in time?

582
00:43:46,427 --> 00:43:48,527
- What? 
 - What's going on?

583
00:43:48,527 --> 00:43:52,197
Grab me the newspaper. Hyunsung Daily from this morning.

584
00:44:05,677 --> 00:44:08,027
How are your studies going?

585
00:44:12,586 --> 00:44:18,987
Just as Soonyang Group needs Hyunsung Daily, I thought you would need me.

586
00:44:30,737 --> 00:44:31,876
   

587
00:44:31,876 --> 00:44:35,646
 "If a US speculation investment firm acquires Ahjin Motors," 

588
00:44:35,646 --> 00:44:40,347
"it is a form of surrendering the Korean market to the US automobile industry."

589
00:44:40,347 --> 00:44:42,317
- Step back! 
 - Step back!

590
00:44:42,317 --> 00:44:45,117
We shall defend Korea's group, Ahjin Motors!

591
00:44:45,117 --> 00:44:48,157
- We shall defend! 
 - We shall defend!

592
00:44:48,157 --> 00:44:50,257
Let us save Ahjin Motors!

593
00:44:50,257 --> 00:44:53,126
- Save it! 
 - Save it!

594
00:44:53,126 --> 00:44:55,896
We shall defend Korea's group, Ahjin Motors!

595
00:44:55,896 --> 00:44:59,837
- We shall defend! 
 - We shall defend!

596
00:44:59,837 --> 00:45:03,367
Chairman Song Hyun Chang couldn't stick with us to the end.

597
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:08,737
In order to publicize Ahjin Motors to the people, public sentiment is the most crucial.

598
00:45:08,737 --> 00:45:10,706
Let us save Ahjin Motors!

599
00:45:10,706 --> 00:45:14,347
- Save it! 
 - Save it!

600
00:45:21,387 --> 00:45:24,287
Hey, Jin Do...

601
00:45:24,287 --> 00:45:26,396
Where are you going?

602
00:45:34,596 --> 00:45:38,996
   

603
00:45:38,996 --> 00:45:41,706
Now, this is what I call a good news article.

604
00:45:41,706 --> 00:45:47,006
Hyunsung Daily is a true patriot.

605
00:45:47,006 --> 00:45:51,217
I can't leave it up to corporations only to save our country.

606
00:45:51,217 --> 00:45:53,666
The media should take part as well.

607
00:45:53,666 --> 00:45:55,327
- Prosecutor Choi. 
 - Yes.

608
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:58,587
This is how hard Hyunsung Daily works,

609
00:45:58,587 --> 00:46:01,396
so you should give him an exclusive scoop.

610
00:46:01,396 --> 00:46:04,367
He's one of us now.

611
00:46:04,367 --> 00:46:08,237
Well, if the two great young people end up tying the knot,

612
00:46:08,237 --> 00:46:11,137
I wouldn't want anything more as a parent.

613
00:46:13,277 --> 00:46:15,777
   

614
00:46:18,617 --> 00:46:23,416
The prosecution has been conducting an internal investigation to indict Ahjin's Chairman Song Hyun Chang.

615
00:46:23,416 --> 00:46:25,887
Chairman Song Hyun Chang?

616
00:46:25,887 --> 00:46:30,226
Yes, in the process of guaranteeing their insolvent affiliations, he made a few rash choices.

617
00:46:30,226 --> 00:46:34,926
His fraudulent accounting and embezzlement are enough to have him detained and interrogated.

618
00:46:34,926 --> 00:46:37,697
If the chairman is arrested for corruption,

619
00:46:37,697 --> 00:46:41,467
how will anybody turn Ahjin Motors into a public corporation?

620
00:46:41,467 --> 00:46:44,206
- Correct. 
 - It'll need to find a new owner.

621
00:46:44,206 --> 00:46:47,806
- Let's eat up. Please, eat. 
 - Yes.

622
00:46:49,577 --> 00:46:52,647
That old man has a fiery temper.

623
00:46:57,686 --> 00:47:00,187
We can't let Soonyang acquire Ahjin Motors like this.

624
00:47:00,187 --> 00:47:01,287
   

625
00:47:01,287 --> 00:47:03,757
Please find a way, CEO Oh.

626
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:11,696
I've been curious ever since the acquisition of Hando Steel.

627
00:47:11,696 --> 00:47:15,297
Do you have one of those common rich heir birth secrets?

628
00:47:15,297 --> 00:47:17,706
Chairman Jin is your grandfather.

629
00:47:17,706 --> 00:47:19,137
Ahjin Motors.

630
00:47:19,137 --> 00:47:22,537
If we at Miracle can't buy it, we can let Soonyang buy it.

631
00:47:22,537 --> 00:47:24,847
Why are you so against that?

632
00:47:32,887 --> 00:47:35,587
Because they're against employee retention.

633
00:47:36,287 --> 00:47:38,927
- What? 
 - Soonyang

634
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:43,427
will fire every single Ahjin Motors employee.

635
00:47:44,197 --> 00:47:47,566
You never wanted Ahjin Motors from the start.

636
00:47:48,237 --> 00:47:51,537
You just wanted to keep everyone at Ahjin employed?

637
00:47:52,407 --> 00:47:56,277
Why didn't you tell me that? Aren't I your partner?

638
00:47:57,907 --> 00:48:00,477
If I'd known that, I'd have never gotten into this.

639
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:02,046
I'm an M&amp;A expert.

640
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:04,546
I'm what the media calls a corporate raider.

641
00:48:04,546 --> 00:48:06,887
I buy up insolvent corporations because it makes money.

642
00:48:06,887 --> 00:48:10,356
Ahjin Motors, yes. Employee retention, no!

643
00:48:11,226 --> 00:48:16,827
I agreed to keep the staff because it was the best way to buy Ahjin Motors.

644
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:19,967
If the miracle you want is to keep everyone at Ahjin employed,

645
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:24,467
that's too bad because that miracle won't happen.

646
00:48:26,976 --> 00:48:27,777
Why not?

647
00:48:27,777 --> 00:48:34,046
The romantic Korean notion of a "job for life" won't fly in the international market.

648
00:48:35,146 --> 00:48:37,947
Our partnership ends today.

649
00:48:40,287 --> 00:48:43,716
I can't run a three-legged race with someone running in the other direction.

650
00:48:43,716 --> 00:48:47,627
It's one or the other. You break a leg or a skull.

651
00:48:55,237 --> 00:48:57,566
I have no choice then.

652
00:48:58,737 --> 00:49:05,377
I'll go to Chairman Jin and negotiate this myself.

653
00:49:05,377 --> 00:49:07,616
You'll negotiate?

654
00:49:07,616 --> 00:49:10,547
You'll show yourself to Chairman Jin?

655
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:13,057
You'll announce that the person

656
00:49:13,057 --> 00:49:16,157
who has been messing with him is his youngest grandson, Jin Do Jun?

657
00:49:16,157 --> 00:49:18,896
You are going against CEO Jin Yang Cheol! Can you handle him?

658
00:49:18,896 --> 00:49:24,326
Soonyang needs money, and I need the people to keep their jobs.

659
00:49:26,336 --> 00:49:29,137
There is no other way.

660
00:49:31,507 --> 00:49:33,837
Why are you so obsessed?

661
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:36,646
There must be a reason for Ahjin's employee retention, isn't there?

662
00:49:36,646 --> 00:49:40,947
Why are you risking so much money on something so futile?

663
00:49:53,097 --> 00:49:55,056
 What I want is... 

664
00:49:55,056 --> 00:49:58,166
 The long fight between Ahjin's acquisition negotiators 

665
00:49:58,166 --> 00:50:03,867
 and labor union regarding employee retention finally broke down today. 

666
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:06,137
 Ahjin Motors' acquisition negotiators 

667
00:50:06,137 --> 00:50:10,046
 officially refused the labor union's demand of employee succession, 

668
00:50:10,046 --> 00:50:15,346
 and it looks inevitable that Ahjin's 2,500 employees will lose their jobs. 

669
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:16,746
 Mom! Mom! 

670
00:50:16,746 --> 00:50:18,847
 I'm coming. The kimchi soup tastes great today. 

671
00:50:18,847 --> 00:50:22,116
 The labor union vowed to go on strike. 

672
00:50:22,116 --> 00:50:25,257
 Ahjin Motors' union's motto is "layoff is murder," 

673
00:50:25,257 --> 00:50:28,197
 and they announced they will block the entrances 

674
00:50:28,197 --> 00:50:30,126
 to the facility and fight until negotiators 

675
00:50:30,126 --> 00:50:33,066
 agree to go back on their plans to lay off staff. 

676
00:50:33,066 --> 00:50:36,606
 Since the labor union decided to take strong action, 

677
00:50:36,606 --> 00:50:39,177
 the site is rampant with violence 

678
00:50:39,177 --> 00:50:42,077
 and emotions are running high. 

679
00:50:54,057 --> 00:50:56,157
 Mom! Mom! 

680
00:50:56,157 --> 00:50:57,927
 Mom! Mom! 

681
00:50:57,927 --> 00:51:01,726
 Wake up, Mom. Mom! 

682
00:51:03,896 --> 00:51:11,866
 My wish that was much bigger and more desperate than wanting Soonyang. 

683
00:51:35,257 --> 00:51:37,796
 That's the reason 

684
00:51:38,766 --> 00:51:41,266
 I can't back out of 

685
00:51:43,737 --> 00:51:45,536
 this futile fight. 

686
00:51:51,246 --> 00:51:53,190
Why are you here?

687
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:57,416
I have something to tell Grandfather.

688
00:51:57,416 --> 00:52:00,117
He went to Cheongwadae.

689
00:52:04,327 --> 00:52:05,956
Why, out of the blue?

690
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:09,156
He tried so hard to take over Ahjin Motors.

691
00:52:09,156 --> 00:52:12,266
It looks like the president gave his approval.

692
00:52:14,496 --> 00:52:18,046
Did the president get involved with Ahjin Motors?

693
00:52:18,046 --> 00:52:20,236
Chairman Jin.

694
00:52:20,236 --> 00:52:22,677
We need you to make a huge decision.

695
00:52:22,677 --> 00:52:24,406
Well...

696
00:52:24,406 --> 00:52:26,317
As you already know,

697
00:52:26,317 --> 00:52:29,287
Chairman Song Hyun Chang has been indisposed,

698
00:52:29,287 --> 00:52:36,356
so we can't postpone the acquisition of Ahjin Motors any longer.

699
00:52:37,456 --> 00:52:41,956
Then the acquisition process.

700
00:52:41,956 --> 00:52:44,226
Can we move right ahead?

701
00:52:44,226 --> 00:52:48,437
Someone else will be here to negotiate that process.

702
00:52:48,437 --> 00:52:50,907
Here he is.

703
00:52:50,907 --> 00:52:53,037
Chairman Jin.

704
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:57,146
Didn't you advise me

705
00:52:58,746 --> 00:53:01,146
not to power trip in a small country

706
00:53:01,146 --> 00:53:04,396
but to go out into the world and earn some dollars?

707
00:53:10,857 --> 00:53:15,357
Grandfather seems to be disgruntled with the president.

708
00:53:15,357 --> 00:53:18,197
You should go home.

709
00:53:20,836 --> 00:53:23,296
Ahjin Motors.

710
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:31,806
Is it official that Soonyang will acquire it?

711
00:53:32,746 --> 00:53:35,596
It seems you're quite interested in company matters.

712
00:53:37,217 --> 00:53:40,916
I heard the president ordered Soonyang and Ahjin Motors' merger

713
00:53:40,916 --> 00:53:43,757
with Daeyoung Motors at the helm.

714
00:54:04,206 --> 00:54:07,346
Is it the water or the butter?

715
00:54:07,346 --> 00:54:09,516
It has no soul.

716
00:54:11,387 --> 00:54:14,257
You made me want to go back anyway.

717
00:54:14,257 --> 00:54:16,316
It all worked out.

718
00:54:19,557 --> 00:54:24,067
Yes. You really have no soul.

719
00:54:24,067 --> 00:54:25,726
But...

720
00:54:27,566 --> 00:54:31,137
you have the Korean spirit.

721
00:54:32,007 --> 00:54:34,037
It's not bad.

722
00:54:47,686 --> 00:54:49,617
Eat up.

723
00:54:49,617 --> 00:54:54,387
It's time for you to make the most important decision of your life.

724
00:54:56,066 --> 00:54:57,666
We can't do a three-legged race.

725
00:54:57,666 --> 00:55:00,967
I plan on keep going in the opposite direction.

726
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:05,736
Let's row instead.

727
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:09,870
Then we can face the opposite direction

728
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:11,030
   

729
00:55:11,037 --> 00:55:13,516
and still partner up.

730
00:55:18,487 --> 00:55:21,186
I won't give up fighting for Ahjin's employees.

731
00:55:21,186 --> 00:55:23,536
Instead, I'll give you

732
00:55:23,536 --> 00:55:26,896
shares to a global top ten

733
00:55:28,527 --> 00:55:30,697
automobile company.

734
00:55:42,546 --> 00:55:48,677
If you could keep Soonyang Motors and acquire Ahjin Motors,

735
00:55:48,677 --> 00:55:52,017
would you do business with Miracle Investment?

736
00:55:53,856 --> 00:55:59,557
I have no money to fight Daeyoung

737
00:56:00,356 --> 00:56:04,397
and no justification to fight the president.

738
00:56:04,397 --> 00:56:09,366
Turn Soonyang Motors into a global top ten car company.

739
00:56:11,606 --> 00:56:14,307
Is that even possible?

740
00:56:16,347 --> 00:56:20,577
Do you take me for the kind of person

741
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:23,686
to fall for your dollar-spewing con?

742
00:56:32,657 --> 00:56:39,597
I am... Jin Yang Cheol.

743
00:56:49,506 --> 00:56:52,506
I must meet with the president.

744
00:56:53,177 --> 00:56:55,777
Does it make sense for me to hand over a company

745
00:56:55,777 --> 00:57:02,516
I spent my life building up without even seeing his face?

746
00:57:04,186 --> 00:57:07,796
Because the national economy is in shambles,

747
00:57:07,796 --> 00:57:11,697
you want my cooperation in restructuring?

748
00:57:16,206 --> 00:57:18,666
I can't do that.

749
00:57:20,037 --> 00:57:23,076
Do you want to reform us conglomerates?

750
00:57:23,076 --> 00:57:25,177
That won't be easy.

751
00:57:25,177 --> 00:57:26,216
Chairman Jin.

752
00:57:26,216 --> 00:57:30,366
We hate spending just one cent for the good of the country,

753
00:57:30,366 --> 00:57:36,647
but to make one cent, we, businessmen, are willing to give our lives.

754
00:57:36,647 --> 00:57:38,456
Mr. President.

755
00:57:38,456 --> 00:57:41,296
When dealing with a businessman, you must make a deal.

756
00:57:41,296 --> 00:57:42,856
A deal, you say?

757
00:57:42,856 --> 00:57:43,997
When running a country...

758
00:57:43,997 --> 00:57:50,466
Have conglomerates that need to be restructured swap subsidiaries on their own.

759
00:57:50,466 --> 00:57:55,177
And only to those companies that agree to do so,

760
00:57:55,177 --> 00:57:58,277
offer cheap loans and tax discounts.

761
00:58:00,217 --> 00:58:05,246
Companies that were against your reform will give in,

762
00:58:05,246 --> 00:58:07,116
and you will become

763
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:12,627
a president that pulled off the conglomerate reform that the IMF wanted.

764
00:58:20,166 --> 00:58:22,837
Isn't that a big deal?

765
00:58:24,166 --> 00:58:26,137
A big deal.

766
00:58:31,177 --> 00:58:34,347
The big deal you suggested.

767
00:58:35,077 --> 00:58:37,777
Will the president bite?

768
00:58:37,777 --> 00:58:42,416
The current government is the first to successfully change the regime.

769
00:58:42,416 --> 00:58:46,816
They'll need an outstanding result that they can show the people.

770
00:58:50,197 --> 00:58:52,367
Nice photo.

771
00:58:54,167 --> 00:58:55,336
   

772
00:58:55,336 --> 00:58:57,307
But of course!

773
00:59:04,907 --> 00:59:09,316
I get to be a successful president.

774
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:14,716
What is it you want, Chairman Jin?

775
00:59:14,716 --> 00:59:17,356
Give me Ahjin Motors.

776
00:59:18,487 --> 00:59:24,457
I'll merge it with Soonyang Motors and add Soonyang Electronics' technology

777
00:59:24,457 --> 00:59:27,666
to make a global top-ten automobile company.

778
00:59:27,666 --> 00:59:30,866
The money to pay off Ahjin Motors' debt.

779
00:59:31,666 --> 00:59:35,036
Do you have it, CEO Jin?

780
00:59:37,177 --> 00:59:41,747
 Sir. Miracle will provide the funds you need to acquire Ahjin. 

781
00:59:56,427 --> 01:00:02,227
 When you offer a deal, there must be a condition. 

782
01:00:02,227 --> 01:00:07,037
 Seventeen percent of Soonyang Motors' shares and employee retention of Ahjin Motors' staff. 

783
01:00:07,037 --> 01:00:09,237
 Employee retention? 

784
01:00:11,746 --> 01:00:15,176
 Do you think I'll accept that condition... 

785
01:00:15,176 --> 01:00:20,316
 Our majority shareholder said you would accept the deal. 

786
01:00:21,086 --> 01:00:27,427
 Because you believe that righteous management means profit. 

787
01:00:30,197 --> 01:00:31,926
Yes.

788
01:00:33,867 --> 01:00:35,896
I do.

789
01:00:38,006 --> 01:00:41,677
The 1.5 trillion won  ($1.5B)  to give the creditors.

790
01:00:44,776 --> 01:00:47,217
I have it.

791
01:00:50,446 --> 01:00:53,286
   

792
01:00:55,956 --> 01:01:01,787
Soonyang Motors and Ahjin Motors are now one body.

793
01:01:01,787 --> 01:01:02,827
   

794
01:01:02,827 --> 01:01:06,197
We're suffering economically in a way we never have before,

795
01:01:06,197 --> 01:01:08,866
and Soonyang Group...

796
01:01:08,866 --> 01:01:10,837
To share the pain,

797
01:01:10,837 --> 01:01:12,066
   

798
01:01:12,066 --> 01:01:20,036
I promise to keep on all of Ahjin Motors' employees without any layoffs.

799
01:01:20,036 --> 01:01:20,977
   

800
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:27,716
 Soonyang Motors' and Ahjin Motors' combined energy will become our engine, 

801
01:01:27,716 --> 01:01:34,957
 and I promise to turn the merged company into a global leader acknowledged by all. 

802
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:38,440
   

803
01:01:59,487 --> 01:02:03,956
 In my previous lifetime, my life ended a failure. 

804
01:02:03,956 --> 01:02:07,327
 But I believed the end was a beginning, 

805
01:02:08,827 --> 01:02:09,927
 and this lifetime... 

806
01:02:09,927 --> 01:02:10,896
   

807
01:02:10,896 --> 01:02:12,566
 was an opportunity. 

808
01:02:12,566 --> 01:02:16,996
I'm impressed. Buying a building at your age?

809
01:02:17,807 --> 01:02:21,077
But why buy the building housing Hyeon Woo's restaurant?

810
01:02:21,077 --> 01:02:24,306
It's run-down and not worth much.

811
01:02:26,516 --> 01:02:33,066
I want to have their kimchi gukbap for a very long time.

812
01:02:35,287 --> 01:02:37,686
- Shall I sign here? 
 - Yes, right there.

813
01:02:37,686 --> 01:02:40,356
   

814
01:02:40,356 --> 01:02:42,597
 I was wrong. 

815
01:02:45,296 --> 01:02:49,097
 This lifetime isn't an opportunity for me. 

816
01:02:50,336 --> 01:02:51,967
 It's a miracle. 

817
01:02:51,967 --> 01:02:56,200
   

818
01:03:38,246 --> 01:03:41,487
 What will you do now? 

819
01:03:41,487 --> 01:03:42,787
 We'll manage. 

820
01:03:42,787 --> 01:03:45,987
 - Oh, Dear. 
 - Poor thing. 

821
01:03:45,987 --> 01:03:47,957
 It's so sad. 

822
01:03:52,027 --> 01:03:54,136
   

823
01:03:54,136 --> 01:03:57,166
You'll have to go on.

824
01:04:00,537 --> 01:04:02,876
Can I help you?

825
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:14,980


826
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:33,880
   

827
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:38,800
♫  Any flower, anything in the world  ♫

828
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:43,790
♫  Will lose its light in front of you  ♫

829
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:49,620
♫  There is but one person in the universe  ♫

830
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:54,110
♫  Who gave me a hug  ♫

831
01:04:54,110 --> 01:05:00,020
♫  You are wonderful to me  ♫

832
01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:06,400
♫  You are beautiful,  ♫

833
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:10,846
 The mother I know would never do that. 

834
01:05:10,846 --> 01:05:12,307
 It was the retention. 

835
01:05:12,307 --> 01:05:16,017
 The public that invested in Soonyang Life Science was sacrificed. 

836
01:05:16,017 --> 01:05:18,347
 But they aren't the ones who caused this pain. 

837
01:05:18,347 --> 01:05:21,416
 Why are the powerless citizens the only ones suffering? 

838
01:05:21,416 --> 01:05:25,057
 Don't you go around saying things like that. 

839
01:05:25,057 --> 01:05:29,756
 You'll never live as a member of the ordinary public. 

840
01:05:29,756 --> 01:05:31,967
 You are my grandson. 

841
01:05:31,967 --> 01:05:34,896
 This is where New Seoul Town will be built. 

842
01:05:34,896 --> 01:05:36,896
 You give it a go. 

843
01:05:36,896 --> 01:05:39,537
 Build a new city here. 

844
01:05:39,537 --> 01:05:42,006
 I found Miracle Investment's next goal. 

845
01:05:42,006 --> 01:05:45,307
 I'm going to build a digital media city in New Seoul Town. 

846
01:05:45,307 --> 01:05:49,220
 The New Seoul Town development project has gone to Jaea Construction. 

847
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:52,930
♫  Will lose its light in front of you  ♫

848
01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:58,650
♫  There is but one person in the universe  ♫
