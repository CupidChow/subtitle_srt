1
00:00:01,151 --> 00:00:03,462
   

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:14,990


3
00:00:24,581 --> 00:00:27,282
 What will you do now? 

4
00:00:27,282 --> 00:00:29,081
 We'll manage. 

5
00:00:29,081 --> 00:00:30,551
 Oh, Dear. 

6
00:00:30,551 --> 00:00:33,321
Poor thing.

7
00:00:33,321 --> 00:00:36,391
 It's so sad. 

8
00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:46,031
You'll have to go on.

9
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:51,671
Can I help you?

10
00:01:16,132 --> 00:01:19,061
It's you, isn't it? Hyeon Woo's parents' restaurant.

11
00:01:19,061 --> 00:01:22,202
You bought the building it's in.

12
00:01:23,271 --> 00:01:25,102
Did you hear the news?

13
00:01:25,102 --> 00:01:29,542
I don't think the family is ready to take visitors yet.

14
00:01:29,542 --> 00:01:31,511
What happened?

15
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:38,782
Was it a heart attack again?

16
00:01:38,782 --> 00:01:40,992
I heard it wasn't an illness.

17
00:01:42,452 --> 00:01:46,932
I heard Hyeon Woo's mom took her own life.

18
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:54,401
What would make a mother of two do that?

19
00:01:54,401 --> 00:01:57,272
The poor, tortured woman.

20
00:01:58,042 --> 00:01:59,442
Hey.

21
00:02:00,711 --> 00:02:02,642
Young man. Hey!

22
00:02:04,382 --> 00:02:09,542
 The mother I know would never make that choice. 

23
00:02:10,482 --> 00:02:15,081
 What on earth... happened in that time? 

24
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:29,642
   

25
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:37,112
   

26
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,561
   

27
00:03:01,972 --> 00:03:03,602
   

28
00:03:13,382 --> 00:03:16,551
   

29
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:34,672
   

30
00:03:41,272 --> 00:03:43,271
 Mom! 

31
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,782
 Mom! 

32
00:03:46,782 --> 00:03:49,951
 I'm freezing. Mom. 

33
00:03:49,951 --> 00:03:51,782
 Your son's home! 

34
00:03:51,782 --> 00:03:54,092
 Mom! 

35
00:03:55,321 --> 00:03:56,592
 Gosh, it's cold. 

36
00:03:56,592 --> 00:03:59,061
 It's cold, isn't it? Are you hungry? 

37
00:03:59,061 --> 00:04:01,162
 I'm starving! 

38
00:04:01,162 --> 00:04:03,732
 What do you want to eat? 

39
00:04:03,732 --> 00:04:06,531
 - Kimchi gukbap. 
 - Kimchi gukbap? 

40
00:04:06,531 --> 00:04:08,902
 Why do we have bean sprouts again? 

41
00:04:08,902 --> 00:04:10,701
 I'll make some gukbap with bean sprouts. 

42
00:04:10,701 --> 00:04:13,141
 Okay. Where's Dad? 

43
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:15,041
 How would I know? 

44
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:20,582
 Why does your expression change whenever I ask about Dad? 

45
00:04:20,582 --> 00:04:23,821
 - It's not what you think. 
 - Seriously... 

46
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:26,152
 Let me help you, Mother. 

47
00:04:26,152 --> 00:04:28,321
 I can finish it on my own in no time. 

48
00:04:28,321 --> 00:04:30,991
 I know what to do. You pinch off the tail. 

49
00:04:30,991 --> 00:04:33,721
 Snap. Like that. 

50
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:42,472
 Mom. I talked to my homeroom teacher today. 

51
00:04:44,571 --> 00:04:48,012
 He kept asking which university I'd apply to. 

52
00:04:48,012 --> 00:04:50,271
 So I said I'd apply. 

53
00:04:56,882 --> 00:05:00,591
 He wouldn't stop bugging me. 

54
00:05:02,222 --> 00:05:05,821
 And I blurted out that I'd go to university. 

55
00:05:07,032 --> 00:05:09,062
 Of course, you should. 

56
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:13,101
 Go inside and study. 

57
00:05:13,101 --> 00:05:16,771
 I'll bring you the gukbap when it's ready. 

58
00:05:18,672 --> 00:05:20,072
 Okay. 

59
00:05:31,152 --> 00:05:33,721
 I'll pay it all back, Mom. 

60
00:05:35,951 --> 00:05:39,422
 I know Dad's company is struggling. 

61
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,091
 And I also know that to cover the rent and the hospital bills, 

62
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,801
 you are selling the restaurant. 

63
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:46,571
   

64
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:48,631
 You're being too cheeky. 

65
00:05:48,631 --> 00:05:51,141
 I'll take care of it. 

66
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:58,281
 I'll make lots of money after university, and pay it all back. 

67
00:05:58,281 --> 00:06:02,612
 I'll make lots of money, and this restaurant too... 

68
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:06,521
 Yes. Make lots of money. 

69
00:06:09,251 --> 00:06:13,992
 Make lots of money...so that you don't have to... 

70
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:18,401
 feel sorry for your kids. 

71
00:06:20,402 --> 00:06:25,402
 Make lots so you can... spoil your kids.

96
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:25,210

98
00:09:29,891 --> 00:09:32,421
"Soonyang Life Science?"

99
00:09:34,832 --> 00:09:36,901
   

100
00:09:39,732 --> 00:09:41,972
   

101
00:09:51,112 --> 00:09:53,142
"Soonyang Life Science."

102
00:09:55,182 --> 00:09:57,882
My mother's stock trading account...

103
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:03,681
is the only clue... I have right now.

104
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:28,012
It was unusual. We couldn't afford to invest.

105
00:10:28,012 --> 00:10:31,251
Mother had never dreamed of making a fortune,

106
00:10:31,251 --> 00:10:34,252
so to think she'd gone into debt,

107
00:10:34,252 --> 00:10:37,121
that was even more unusual.

108
00:10:39,092 --> 00:10:44,202
The shares she invested everything in were from Soonyang Life Science.

109
00:10:44,202 --> 00:10:46,502
But why?

110
00:10:46,502 --> 00:10:51,901
Why did Soonyang Life Science in particular up being liquidated?

111
00:11:07,621 --> 00:11:09,321
Hey, you!

112
00:11:09,321 --> 00:11:11,962
What's going on?

113
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:16,492
You should've called after blowing me off that day.

114
00:11:16,492 --> 00:11:18,332
Do you know how worried I was?

115
00:11:18,332 --> 00:11:21,432
Did something happen at home, or were you sick?

116
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:23,701
But you've been coming to the library?

117
00:11:23,701 --> 00:11:27,141
Yes. I gave you my number.

118
00:11:27,141 --> 00:11:30,411
I waited for you every day at the cafe I worked at,

119
00:11:30,411 --> 00:11:33,712
and I went crazy and asked you out first.

120
00:11:33,712 --> 00:11:35,182
But so what?

121
00:11:35,182 --> 00:11:37,552
That doesn't mean you can look down on me.

122
00:11:37,552 --> 00:11:39,552
Did you hear that?

123
00:11:39,552 --> 00:11:41,151
Why do that in the library?

124
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:43,021
- It's so noisy. 
 - What a nuisance.

125
00:11:43,021 --> 00:11:44,592
Unbelievable.

126
00:11:44,592 --> 00:11:46,962
Is she not embarrassed at all?

127
00:11:46,962 --> 00:11:49,691
Did she confess her love in the library?

128
00:11:49,691 --> 00:11:51,531
I know.

129
00:11:51,531 --> 00:11:53,871
She must be so embarrassed.

130
00:11:53,871 --> 00:11:57,472
What was she thinking? I'd love to know.

131
00:12:06,612 --> 00:12:08,552
Isn't this her?

143
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:29,161
Soonyang Life Science's future was becoming increasingly bleaker,

144
00:13:29,161 --> 00:13:32,363
so it was one of the useless subsidiaries.

145
00:13:32,363 --> 00:13:35,732
But after the financial crisis, the media brought it up. 
    

146
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:39,771
Beckoning people to come to the land of hope and dreams.

147
00:13:45,781 --> 00:13:49,112
 Soonyang Life Science's stock price that had been falling 

148
00:13:49,112 --> 00:13:51,381
 after the financial crisis peaked. 

149
00:13:51,381 --> 00:13:53,281
 Keep going up. 

150
00:13:53,281 --> 00:13:56,222
 And the minority shareholders who trusted the Soonyang name... 

151
00:13:56,222 --> 00:13:58,062
  Goodness, it's already 10 a.m. 

152
00:13:58,062 --> 00:14:01,232
It's already past 10 a.m.

153
00:14:01,232 --> 00:14:02,862
 Worth 38,000 won ($38). 

154
00:14:02,862 --> 00:14:04,301
 Soonyang Life Science, 29,000 won ($28). 

155
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:08,371
 They kept buying more shares without any doubt. 

156
00:14:10,842 --> 00:14:15,141
But Soonyang chose to liquidate the company, not to invest in it.

157
00:14:15,141 --> 00:14:18,511
All sorts of things happen in business.

158
00:14:18,511 --> 00:14:21,081
This is what's important.

159
00:14:21,081 --> 00:14:24,352
Gnaynoos is a foreign equity fund and institutional investor. 
     

160
00:14:24,352 --> 00:14:27,192
They bought and sold Soonyang Life Science's shares in a short period,

161
00:14:27,192 --> 00:14:29,751
making a massive profit.

162
00:14:29,751 --> 00:14:31,092
"Gnaynoos?" 
  (T/N: Soonyang spelled backward) 

163
00:14:31,092 --> 00:14:34,232
They made risky investments.

164
00:14:34,232 --> 00:14:36,732
I say they're a speculative hedge fund.

165
00:14:36,732 --> 00:14:40,832
I'm sorry to say that currently, Korea is a paradise for hedge funds.

166
00:14:40,832 --> 00:14:43,541
Prices are cheap, and there is a lot to eat.

167
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,742
Buy Korea. Why not?

168
00:14:46,742 --> 00:14:49,411
What do you think about this then?

169
00:14:49,411 --> 00:14:53,882
Focus on the date Gnaynoos sold all their Soonyang Life Science shares.

170
00:14:53,882 --> 00:14:58,281
It happened just one day before Chairman Jin announced 
    

171
00:14:58,281 --> 00:15:01,722
he'd cooperate with the President's Big Deal policy.

172
00:15:01,722 --> 00:15:04,562
It's also the day before he announced he'd liquidate

173
00:15:04,562 --> 00:15:07,292
Soonyang Life Science as part of the Big Deal.

174
00:15:07,292 --> 00:15:11,432
It's an exit. Institutional investors knew what Soonyang would do

175
00:15:11,432 --> 00:15:14,032
and strategically got out in time.

176
00:15:14,032 --> 00:15:16,901
It's not just a simple hedge fund.

177
00:15:18,342 --> 00:15:22,242
Are you saying Gnaynoos had something to do with Soonyang Group?

178
00:15:23,371 --> 00:15:24,582
I don't know that.

179
00:15:24,582 --> 00:15:27,352
So I called my contacts in New York.

180
00:15:27,352 --> 00:15:31,381
I asked them to find out what Gnaynoos does.

181
00:15:35,251 --> 00:15:40,222
Oh, my...They're amazingly loyal.

182
00:15:41,092 --> 00:15:42,962
Gnaynoos' limited partner investors

183
00:15:42,962 --> 00:15:46,862
all used to be Soonyang's financial executives.

184
00:15:51,472 --> 00:15:56,541
That means Gnaynoos is Soonyang's slush fund.

185
00:15:56,541 --> 00:16:01,551
And with that money, they bought Soonyang Corporation's shares.

186
00:16:01,551 --> 00:16:06,252
Because it's the mother company that governs all subsidiaries.

187
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,221
   

188
00:16:17,131 --> 00:16:19,102
   

189
00:16:19,102 --> 00:16:24,002
Gnaynoos successfully bought 4.9 percent of Soonyang Corporation's shares.

190
00:16:24,002 --> 00:16:29,742
You have all you need to ensure management remains within the family.

191
00:16:29,742 --> 00:16:32,942
4.9% of Soonyang Corporation shares.

192
00:16:32,942 --> 00:16:34,352
How much is it in cash?

193
00:16:34,352 --> 00:16:38,752
All 90 billion won  ($90M)  made from liquidating Soonyang Life Science.

194
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,021
It is a real big deal.

195
00:16:48,691 --> 00:16:51,232
We made a profit.

196
00:16:54,601 --> 00:16:56,631
 It was because of the succession. 

197
00:16:56,631 --> 00:17:00,542
Rather than paying the astronomical amount of inheritance tax to hand down the company,

198
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:02,871
Soonyang Life Science... 
    

199
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:08,612
No. The public that invested in Soonyang Life Science was sacrificed.

200
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:11,482
While pretending to take initiative in the Big Deal policy

201
00:17:11,482 --> 00:17:14,621
to reform the conglomerate the government and IMF wanted...

202
00:17:18,961 --> 00:17:21,531
- Grandpa. 
 - Hello.

203
00:17:23,092 --> 00:17:25,302
What are you doing here?

204
00:17:25,302 --> 00:17:28,031
You didn't even call.

205
00:17:28,031 --> 00:17:30,331
I missed you, so I came to see you.

206
00:17:30,331 --> 00:17:33,610
Good. Sit down.

207
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:37,942
I'm sure you are not here because you're out of pocket money.

208
00:17:39,112 --> 00:17:42,670
So what's this about?

209
00:17:44,211 --> 00:17:47,552
So... Soonyang Life Science.

210
00:17:47,552 --> 00:17:50,621
I heard it was liquidated.

211
00:17:53,992 --> 00:17:58,301
Until recently, there was a lot of news coverage

212
00:17:59,702 --> 00:18:02,502
that it's Soonyang Group's major business.

213
00:18:02,502 --> 00:18:05,302
That it'll lead us into the next generation.

214
00:18:05,302 --> 00:18:07,201
What about it?

215
00:18:08,572 --> 00:18:09,972
Well...

216
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:16,252
Our PR department wouldn't have spread lies.

217
00:18:17,352 --> 00:18:21,752
That means you were convinced the business would do well

218
00:18:21,752 --> 00:18:26,021
so why was it suddenly sold off?

219
00:18:27,092 --> 00:18:29,192
I wanted to hear from you.

220
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,141
Do you want an answer?

221
00:18:41,141 --> 00:18:42,641
Yes.

222
00:18:44,781 --> 00:18:49,812
The president was looking for any excuse to bring us down.

223
00:18:49,812 --> 00:18:51,381
What else could I do?

224
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:54,852
What power do I have when I'm just an old man?

225
00:18:54,852 --> 00:18:56,621
If the president wields a sword,

226
00:18:56,621 --> 00:19:01,591
you lie low and feign death.

227
00:19:01,591 --> 00:19:05,432
That's how you stay alive, isn't it?

228
00:19:22,951 --> 00:19:25,151
The minority shareholders.

229
00:19:26,921 --> 00:19:29,551
The public must've suffered a lot.

230
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:31,461
Those people

231
00:19:34,332 --> 00:19:40,392
did nothing wrong but believe in our company.

232
00:19:40,392 --> 00:19:46,001
Why would you care about...those people?

233
00:19:47,971 --> 00:19:51,612
You'll never live as a member of the ordinary public.

234
00:19:52,411 --> 00:19:54,881
You are my grandson.

235
00:20:01,752 --> 00:20:06,262
Don't recklessly go around saying things like that.

236
00:20:06,262 --> 00:20:11,862
People will point fingers at you, saying you're pretending to care.

237
00:20:15,302 --> 00:20:18,971
You went to law school and said you weren't interested in our company's business.

238
00:20:18,971 --> 00:20:21,042
Did you change your mind?

239
00:20:22,171 --> 00:20:27,242
Do you want... to inherit Soonyang from me?

240
00:20:32,151 --> 00:20:34,381
No way, Grandpa.

241
00:20:36,191 --> 00:20:41,761
I never thought about inheriting Soonyang, Grandpa.

242
00:20:41,761 --> 00:20:43,431
Is that so?

243
00:20:52,141 --> 00:20:55,641
Save Soonyang Life Science!

244
00:20:55,641 --> 00:20:58,842
- Save it! 
 - Save it!

245
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:01,552
Retract the decision!

246
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:04,421
- Retract it! 
 - Retract it!

247
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:07,691
Protect the proprietary rights of minority shareholders!

248
00:21:07,691 --> 00:21:10,961
- Protect it! 
 - Protect it!

249
00:21:10,961 --> 00:21:13,691
Chairman Jin Yang Cheol, take responsibility!

250
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:16,731
- Take responsibility! 
 - Take responsibility!

251
00:21:16,731 --> 00:21:21,962
Soonyang which cannot withstand economic crisis, reflect!

252
00:21:21,962 --> 00:21:25,441
- Reflect! 
 - Reflect!

253
00:21:25,441 --> 00:21:29,112
Chairman Jin Yang Cheol, take responsibility!

254
00:21:29,112 --> 00:21:32,582
- Take responsibility! 
 - Take responsibility!

255
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,782
Soonyang, retract it!

256
00:21:34,782 --> 00:21:38,521
- Retract it! 
 - Retract it!

257
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:48,192
I'm sorry.

258
00:22:04,012 --> 00:22:06,962
   

259
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:15,852
   

260
00:22:15,852 --> 00:22:19,102
   

261
00:22:44,522 --> 00:22:46,290
   

262
00:23:18,421 --> 00:23:21,492
   

263
00:23:38,142 --> 00:23:39,742
   

264
00:23:39,742 --> 00:23:42,312
 From joining the company... 
   

265
00:23:42,312 --> 00:23:47,791
to becoming Junior Managing Director, it normally takes 27 years.

266
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:52,021
But despite not having any accomplishments,

267
00:23:53,082 --> 00:23:56,191
I became the owner of this room.

268
00:23:56,191 --> 00:23:58,092
What can I do?

269
00:23:58,092 --> 00:24:01,542
My grandfather happens to be Chairman Jin Yang Cheol.

270
00:24:02,631 --> 00:24:06,161
   

271
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:09,332
I won't take this privilege for granted.

272
00:24:10,002 --> 00:24:16,072
I will do my best to fulfill my duty with a huge responsibility.

273
00:24:17,112 --> 00:24:20,542
You welcomed me warmly even though I'm lacking.

274
00:24:21,552 --> 00:24:23,781
Thank you very much.

275
00:24:36,461 --> 00:24:37,661
Thank you.

276
00:24:37,661 --> 00:24:40,362
Seong Jun became the junior managing director of Soonyang Construction.

277
00:24:40,362 --> 00:24:41,931
Hold on.

278
00:24:42,631 --> 00:24:47,942
Did he give his eldest grandson a post in Soonyang Construction, which is a sinecure?

279
00:24:49,171 --> 00:24:52,442
It's a penalty! Collective punishment, at that.

280
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:58,251
Gosh, my old man.

281
00:24:58,251 --> 00:25:02,821
He kept track of all of Young Ki's failures,

282
00:25:02,821 --> 00:25:05,991
then pushed it all onto Seong Jun.

283
00:25:05,991 --> 00:25:08,431
The timing is rather dramatic.

284
00:25:08,431 --> 00:25:10,762
   

285
00:25:10,762 --> 00:25:15,531
I thought the succession was about to start with Soonyang Corporation's stocks that he bought through Gnaynoos,

286
00:25:15,531 --> 00:25:18,871
but he sent the center of the succession, Junior Managing Director Jin Seong Jun,

287
00:25:18,871 --> 00:25:23,611
to Soonyang Construction, not Corporation or Electronics.

288
00:25:23,611 --> 00:25:26,711
It means I still have time.

289
00:25:26,711 --> 00:25:29,552
How much of Soonyang Corporation's shares can I buy?

290
00:25:29,552 --> 00:25:32,181
What if you buy Soonyang Corporation?

291
00:25:32,181 --> 00:25:34,231
How much of it can you buy?

292
00:25:34,231 --> 00:25:37,721
What's important is whom he's going to give the stocks

293
00:25:37,721 --> 00:25:40,621
he bought under a borrowed name to.

294
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:47,292
Still, in the end, wouldn't he give them to Seong Jun?

295
00:25:47,292 --> 00:25:51,232
Primogeniture is Father's principle.

296
00:25:52,102 --> 00:25:53,971
Wait.

297
00:25:53,971 --> 00:26:00,012
Then why did he send his eldest grandson to Soonyang Construction, of all places?

298
00:26:11,562 --> 00:26:14,662
No, I didn't send him.

299
00:26:14,662 --> 00:26:17,392
Seong Jun volunteered.

300
00:26:19,131 --> 00:26:21,401
- Seong Jun did? 
 - Yes.

301
00:26:21,401 --> 00:26:24,101
I asked him to send me to Soonyang Construction.

302
00:26:24,101 --> 00:26:28,242
Why Construction of all places when you have to go to rough construction sites?

303
00:26:28,242 --> 00:26:30,572
You need to get married, too.

304
00:26:30,572 --> 00:26:35,682
Youths nowadays dislike it saying it has gone out of fashion after the New Village Movement in the 70s.

305
00:26:35,682 --> 00:26:38,522
My eldest nephew has a unique taste.

306
00:26:38,522 --> 00:26:41,121
He spent a great deal of money studying abroad.

307
00:26:41,121 --> 00:26:43,592
I'm sure he has a plan.

308
00:26:43,592 --> 00:26:46,122
Let's hear you out.

309
00:26:48,461 --> 00:26:51,631
There are a lot of competent people at Soonyang Electronics.

310
00:26:51,631 --> 00:26:55,132
Finance and Distribution have Uncle and Aunt.

311
00:26:55,832 --> 00:26:59,602
I'm quite curious about why Construction lost its previous value.

312
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:03,671
Above all, Soonyang was able to grow this much

313
00:27:03,671 --> 00:27:08,511
because Grandfather earned expensive dollars from working in Saudi Arabia enduring the sandy wind.

314
00:27:08,511 --> 00:27:11,312
I felt bad leaving it as it is.

315
00:27:15,391 --> 00:27:17,822
I'm so upset, Mother.

316
00:27:17,822 --> 00:27:21,131
He hasn't known how to secure his own benefits since he was young.

317
00:27:21,131 --> 00:27:22,432
Exactly.

318
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:26,531
Hyungnim*, Seong Jun speaks so sweetly.  
 (Title for one's husband's older brother's wife) 

319
00:27:26,531 --> 00:27:30,771
He's better suited for politics rather than business.

320
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:37,742
Who is suited for what?

321
00:27:44,782 --> 00:27:46,522
Politics?

322
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,052
Politics?

323
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:56,732
Because of those politicians, I

324
00:27:56,732 --> 00:28:02,201
and Soonyang, suffered so much yet again.

325
00:28:02,201 --> 00:28:04,902
Does anyone here not know this?

326
00:28:04,902 --> 00:28:06,841
I'm sorry, Father.

327
00:28:06,841 --> 00:28:09,571
I didn't mean that.

328
00:28:10,542 --> 00:28:12,911
- Prosecutor Choi. 
 - Yes.

329
00:28:12,911 --> 00:28:16,282
I heard you were going to run for mayor this time.

330
00:28:16,282 --> 00:28:18,081
Is this true?

331
00:28:19,852 --> 00:28:21,592
Well...

332
00:28:21,592 --> 00:28:24,092
People around me kept insisting that I was the perfect fit.

333
00:28:24,092 --> 00:28:27,892
What's great about you besides the fact that you're my son-in-law?

334
00:28:29,731 --> 00:28:33,862
They're all trying to steal my money.

335
00:28:35,231 --> 00:28:39,341
My husband is looked down on only in this house.

336
00:28:39,341 --> 00:28:43,312
Outside, he's a just prosecutor who led the elimination of corruption.

337
00:28:43,312 --> 00:28:45,881
It's all thanks to you for wielding a poultry knife and using him to get rid of others.

338
00:28:45,881 --> 00:28:48,881
Don't try to use a poultry knife to butcher a cow.

339
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:51,952
Prosecutor is the right place for him.

340
00:28:51,952 --> 00:28:56,282
- Father. 
 - Your righteous husband that the whole world acknowledges!

341
00:28:56,282 --> 00:28:58,992
If you want to get him kicked out jobless,

342
00:28:58,992 --> 00:29:03,391
take this chance to remove him from his position as my son-in-law

343
00:29:03,391 --> 00:29:05,702
and open up a new law firm of his own.

344
00:29:07,062 --> 00:29:09,431
And see if anyone approaches him.

345
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:19,781
Why would you get up even before finishing your meal?

346
00:29:26,921 --> 00:29:28,722
Oppa Young Ki!

347
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,821
Why did you stay silent?

348
00:29:33,592 --> 00:29:36,162
You promised you would support my husband.

349
00:29:36,162 --> 00:29:39,402
Father is not wrong.

350
00:29:40,262 --> 00:29:44,702
Chang Je, don't feel upset.

351
00:29:44,702 --> 00:29:47,372
Public Security and Special Unit.

352
00:29:47,372 --> 00:29:52,452
You were able to work in these departments, all thanks to Father. No?

353
00:29:53,211 --> 00:29:55,252
Of course, Hyungnim Young Ki.

354
00:29:55,252 --> 00:30:01,451
Chang Je, you don't show that you were raised poor.

355
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:04,422
Normally, those who were raised poor catch on quick.

356
00:30:04,422 --> 00:30:07,461
You know how Father is.

357
00:30:07,461 --> 00:30:10,162
So why would you admit it?

358
00:30:10,162 --> 00:30:14,062
I'm sure he didn't know this conflict would happen.

359
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:17,331
What are you guys doing?

360
00:30:17,331 --> 00:30:18,672
What's wrong?

361
00:30:18,672 --> 00:30:20,502
I see.

362
00:30:20,502 --> 00:30:26,941
Does my husband still look like a country bumpkin who comes to this house to make money as a tutor?

363
00:30:31,451 --> 00:30:33,421
Just watch.

364
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:37,821
How far Chang Je can go as a politician.

365
00:30:37,821 --> 00:30:40,462
I will make sure to show you.

366
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:44,532
Let's go.

367
00:30:51,071 --> 00:30:52,672
Well...

368
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:56,572
I'm sorry to make a scene on such a nice day.

369
00:30:56,572 --> 00:30:58,212
Hurry!

370
00:31:06,421 --> 00:31:07,951
Let's eat.

371
00:31:28,272 --> 00:31:31,242
He would need to bow and shake hands during every election.

372
00:31:31,242 --> 00:31:33,441
Why does he want to get into politics?

373
00:31:33,441 --> 00:31:36,081
Nowadays, money is power.

374
00:31:36,081 --> 00:31:40,052
In the end, what moves money is power.

375
00:31:41,492 --> 00:31:44,691
If Grandfather hates politics,

376
00:31:44,691 --> 00:31:49,332
it would mean politicians still hold a lot of power.

377
00:31:51,762 --> 00:31:55,432
Gosh, what are engineering students doing?

378
00:31:55,432 --> 00:31:58,371
Can't they put the songs in these albums

379
00:31:58,371 --> 00:32:00,171
into a device that fits in one hand?

380
00:32:00,171 --> 00:32:03,272
The size of an apple.

381
00:32:03,272 --> 00:32:04,842
Apple?

382
00:32:06,711 --> 00:32:08,481
Is that going too far?

383
00:32:08,481 --> 00:32:13,221
Then melon. Melon sounds good.

384
00:32:14,651 --> 00:32:17,821
Try making it. I'll invest in it.

385
00:32:17,821 --> 00:32:19,392
- Are you going to invest in it?
- Yes.

386
00:32:19,392 --> 00:32:22,462
That means it will work.

387
00:32:23,292 --> 00:32:25,431
No.

388
00:32:25,431 --> 00:32:27,031
You're not an artist

389
00:32:27,031 --> 00:32:29,981
if such chicken feed makes you waver.

390
00:32:31,602 --> 00:32:34,072
I heard that you were talented in investing.

391
00:32:34,072 --> 00:32:36,042
But why did you go to law school?

392
00:32:36,042 --> 00:32:38,742
You don't seem to be uninterested in business, either.

393
00:32:38,742 --> 00:32:43,082
I'm uninterested in Soonyang's business, at least.

394
00:32:47,582 --> 00:32:52,321
My dad is different from Uncle and Aunt.

395
00:32:53,022 --> 00:32:54,461
I think Grandfather didn't make me work in the company

396
00:32:54,461 --> 00:32:56,631
because he didn't want me to.

397
00:32:56,631 --> 00:33:00,281
Before I'm Grandfather's grandson, I am my dad's son.

398
00:33:01,502 --> 00:33:04,271
I don't start a fight

399
00:33:05,742 --> 00:33:07,692
that already has an ending.

400
00:33:08,342 --> 00:33:09,811
Father.

401
00:33:10,911 --> 00:33:12,841
Yes.

402
00:33:12,841 --> 00:33:15,452
It's late. We should go home, too.

403
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:16,682
Okay.

404
00:33:16,682 --> 00:33:19,282
Seong Jun, congratulations again on your first day of work.

405
00:33:19,282 --> 00:33:20,851
Thank you.

406
00:33:20,851 --> 00:33:24,052
Uncle. I knew he got good grades,

407
00:33:24,052 --> 00:33:26,722
but he's really smart.

408
00:33:27,421 --> 00:33:29,892
Let's keep in touch.

409
00:33:36,831 --> 00:33:39,501
Did something happen?

410
00:33:40,241 --> 00:33:43,311
It's your brother-in-law who got scolded by Father.

411
00:33:43,311 --> 00:33:45,842
So why do you look like you were wronged?

412
00:33:45,842 --> 00:33:48,242
I do?

413
00:33:51,052 --> 00:33:52,351
See this?

414
00:33:52,351 --> 00:33:56,191
This middle-aged man who looks like he was wronged?

415
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:00,362
You're right.

416
00:34:01,191 --> 00:34:02,931
I feel wronged.

417
00:34:03,731 --> 00:34:05,631
So it's true.

418
00:34:06,262 --> 00:34:09,932
I know very well what my son wants,

419
00:34:09,932 --> 00:34:12,782
but as long as he's born as my son,

420
00:34:13,941 --> 00:34:15,972
I have to tell him

421
00:34:15,972 --> 00:34:19,622
not to start anything that goes against Grandfather's wishes.

422
00:34:20,342 --> 00:34:22,352
That's my place.

423
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:24,982
I feel sorry

424
00:34:26,581 --> 00:34:28,631
for being this kind of a dad.

425
00:34:32,021 --> 00:34:33,422
I'm sorry, Father.

426
00:34:33,422 --> 00:34:35,261
Why, Hyeong Jun?

427
00:34:35,261 --> 00:34:40,061
You are right. I passed the Seochon Music audition.

428
00:34:40,061 --> 00:34:43,102
You noticed my talent from that short moment.

429
00:34:43,102 --> 00:34:45,402
Talent isn't something you can hide.

430
00:34:45,402 --> 00:34:47,372
I was foolish.

431
00:34:47,372 --> 00:34:49,772
I guess this is the fate of a genius.

432
00:34:49,772 --> 00:34:51,711
Audition?

433
00:34:51,711 --> 00:34:53,412
Seochon Music?

434
00:34:53,412 --> 00:34:56,612
I'm going to debut as a singer in the summer.

435
00:34:56,612 --> 00:34:58,181
What?

436
00:34:59,581 --> 00:35:02,622
Will you really become a singer?

437
00:35:02,622 --> 00:35:05,691
Didn't you already guess that?

438
00:35:05,691 --> 00:35:09,231
- Weren't you just dressed that way? 
 - What?

439
00:35:10,362 --> 00:35:12,461
Don't laugh.

440
00:35:15,171 --> 00:35:17,531
Are you a good singer then?

441
00:35:17,531 --> 00:35:19,471
What?

442
00:35:30,012 --> 00:35:32,581
Where is this, Grandfather?

443
00:35:32,581 --> 00:35:34,051
This is

444
00:35:34,751 --> 00:35:39,421
the island of orchids and grass.

445
00:35:39,421 --> 00:35:41,791
It has a pretty name too.

446
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:43,032
Nanji Island.

447
00:35:43,032 --> 00:35:45,262
Nanji Island is

448
00:35:45,262 --> 00:35:49,032
the island that was used as a landfill...

449
00:35:51,742 --> 00:35:55,242
They buried the trash piled up as high as a mountain down here.

450
00:35:55,242 --> 00:35:59,142
Then the land beneath would be full of gas.

451
00:35:59,142 --> 00:36:01,512
Here, here!

452
00:36:01,512 --> 00:36:03,982
It might collapse.

453
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:13,162
Seong Jun, look carefully.

454
00:36:13,162 --> 00:36:17,262
This is where New Seoul Town will be built.

455
00:36:19,461 --> 00:36:24,332
Seoul World Cup Stadium will be built over there,

456
00:36:24,332 --> 00:36:27,202
and a new city will be built next to that.

457
00:36:27,202 --> 00:36:30,711
The budget is five trillion won  ($5B) .

458
00:36:30,711 --> 00:36:33,012
Once the election for the mayor of Seoul is over,

459
00:36:33,012 --> 00:36:35,142
things will progress fast

460
00:36:35,142 --> 00:36:37,792
starting with the selection of the company in charge.

461
00:36:39,481 --> 00:36:41,421
You should try.

462
00:36:41,421 --> 00:36:44,552
- Sorry? 
 - From bidding to construction.

463
00:36:44,552 --> 00:36:47,521
Take charge of the project

464
00:36:47,521 --> 00:36:51,531
and build a new city here.

465
00:36:53,231 --> 00:36:55,302
My eldest grandson.

466
00:37:02,711 --> 00:37:04,171
Why do you keep insisting against it?

467
00:37:04,171 --> 00:37:07,142
Miracle Investments won't invest in small start-up enterprise businesses.

468
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:08,982
"Small smart-up businesses are the flowers of the new world."

469
00:37:08,982 --> 00:37:10,912
Didn't you listen to the president's inauguration speech?

470
00:37:10,912 --> 00:37:13,651
One trillion won  ($1B)  is out in the market.

471
00:37:13,651 --> 00:37:16,592
- We should go flower viewing. 
 - It's not too late to invest

472
00:37:16,592 --> 00:37:19,422
after the flowers fall and plants bear fruits.

473
00:37:23,731 --> 00:37:25,162
Goodness.

474
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:29,032
 As NASDAQ Composite fell, 

475
00:37:29,032 --> 00:37:32,301
 KOSDAQ Composite fell below 200. 

476
00:37:32,301 --> 00:37:35,042
 The froth has come out of modern technology shares. 

477
00:37:35,042 --> 00:37:38,041
 There are many online dot-com companies 

478
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:39,642
 that are facing a crisis. 

479
00:37:39,642 --> 00:37:41,651
 Crises of dot-com companies 

480
00:37:41,651 --> 00:37:43,651
 are caused by an excessive investment 

481
00:37:43,651 --> 00:37:48,182
 without a clear revenue model. 

482
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,710
   

483
00:37:58,932 --> 00:38:01,332
I said no.

484
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,742
In the US,

485
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:09,671
do you know which area's house prices rose the most?

486
00:38:09,671 --> 00:38:11,011
New York? No.

487
00:38:11,011 --> 00:38:13,381
Silicon Valley? Yes.

488
00:38:13,381 --> 00:38:16,452
New businesses always need new land,

489
00:38:16,452 --> 00:38:20,722
and money is bound to gather in that place.

490
00:38:20,722 --> 00:38:23,822
Do you think Yeongdong, once a cheap area,

491
00:38:23,822 --> 00:38:25,961
became one of the most expensive areas in Gangnam

492
00:38:25,961 --> 00:38:28,461
just because of wealthy housewives' property speculation?

493
00:38:28,461 --> 00:38:30,461
It's because a highway was built.

494
00:38:30,461 --> 00:38:33,432
What is the 21st century's highway?

495
00:38:33,432 --> 00:38:34,561
IT.

496
00:38:34,561 --> 00:38:37,972
Correct.

497
00:38:37,972 --> 00:38:39,941
Wait.

498
00:38:39,941 --> 00:38:41,912
Can you say that again?

499
00:38:41,912 --> 00:38:44,372
Correct.

500
00:38:44,372 --> 00:38:45,941
Wealthy housewives? Cheap area?

501
00:38:45,941 --> 00:38:48,181
No, before that.

502
00:38:48,181 --> 00:38:50,112
What was that about new businesses?

503
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:52,322
They need new land,

504
00:38:52,322 --> 00:38:56,021
and money is bound to gather in that place.

505
00:38:58,822 --> 00:39:02,191
 New businesses and new land. 

506
00:39:02,191 --> 00:39:04,692
 Digital and media. 

507
00:39:04,692 --> 00:39:08,302
 Yes, it's Sangam-dong. 

508
00:39:09,231 --> 00:39:11,532
 New Seoul Town development that provided money to Soonyang 

509
00:39:11,532 --> 00:39:15,742
 which almost faced liquidity risk right after the IMF crisis. 

510
00:39:15,742 --> 00:39:18,541
 It's that Sangam-dong. 

511
00:39:18,541 --> 00:39:20,042
I found

512
00:39:20,042 --> 00:39:22,492
Miracle Investment's next goal.

513
00:39:24,182 --> 00:39:25,951
Thank you, CEO Oh.

514
00:39:30,962 --> 00:39:34,461
   

515
00:39:34,461 --> 00:39:38,331
I'm going to build a digital media city in New Seoul Town.

516
00:39:38,331 --> 00:39:41,001
- A digital media city? 
 - Yes.

517
00:39:41,001 --> 00:39:44,632
It's the center of entertainment business with IT infrastructure.

518
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,771
   

519
00:39:45,771 --> 00:39:48,041
Your new business is entertainment?

520
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:52,442
In Korea, which doesn't speak English and has less than fifty million people?

521
00:39:52,442 --> 00:39:55,511
A day will come when the world goes crazy

522
00:39:55,511 --> 00:39:58,451
over Korean songs, movies, and dramas.

523
00:39:58,451 --> 00:40:04,192
Does the person you admire the most happen to be Kim Goo?

524
00:40:04,192 --> 00:40:05,392
Yes.

525
00:40:05,392 --> 00:40:06,762
The book that left you

526
00:40:06,762 --> 00:40:08,392
- a deep impression is... 
 - "Baekbeom's Diary."

527
00:40:08,392 --> 00:40:10,192
I see.

528
00:40:10,192 --> 00:40:13,131
"What I want the most is..."

529
00:40:13,131 --> 00:40:16,001
"the power of culture."

530
00:40:18,642 --> 00:40:21,972
You must dream of Korea becoming the cultural powerhouse.

531
00:40:21,972 --> 00:40:24,612
Well, you're free to dream.

532
00:40:24,612 --> 00:40:27,512
The problem is, we don't have a construction company.

533
00:40:27,512 --> 00:40:29,711
Are you going to shovel yourself, Fellow Korean Lad?

534
00:40:29,711 --> 00:40:31,012
I asked her to check for a construction company

535
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,852
that we can buy.

536
00:40:32,852 --> 00:40:36,952
   

537
00:40:36,952 --> 00:40:38,361
   

538
00:40:38,361 --> 00:40:42,062
It's the most cost-effective among the companies that are big enough.

539
00:40:42,062 --> 00:40:44,362
- Jea Construction is? 
 - Yes.

540
00:40:44,362 --> 00:40:45,802
Number one.

541
00:40:45,802 --> 00:40:49,901
It doesn't have any affiliates, so taking over will be simple.

542
00:40:49,901 --> 00:40:51,372
Number two.

543
00:40:51,372 --> 00:40:53,702
The owner family is a bit problematic.

544
00:40:53,702 --> 00:40:56,071
What do you mean?

545
00:40:56,071 --> 00:40:57,912
It's sort of an occupational disease 
    

546
00:40:57,912 --> 00:40:59,811
of Korean conglomerate owners.

547
00:40:59,811 --> 00:41:02,351
They think the company vault is theirs.

548
00:41:02,351 --> 00:41:05,122
It’s the trifecta: breach of fiduciary duty, embezzlement, and even accounting fraud.

549
00:41:05,122 --> 00:41:06,421
They must be over-stating actual construction costs

550
00:41:06,421 --> 00:41:08,222
and fixing the prices as well.

551
00:41:08,222 --> 00:41:09,722
Construction companies are the easiest

552
00:41:09,722 --> 00:41:11,251
to make money without labels.

553
00:41:11,251 --> 00:41:12,922
Bingo.

554
00:41:22,372 --> 00:41:25,322
How could you join Soonyang Construction

555
00:41:25,322 --> 00:41:29,951
without discussing with me and as you like?

556
00:41:30,841 --> 00:41:32,241
At this critical time?

557
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:36,691
Right now, we should acquire more shares in Soonyang Corporation.

558
00:41:37,481 --> 00:41:43,081
Before the succession plan is finalized, Grandfather could pass away.

559
00:41:43,081 --> 00:41:44,952
- What? 
 - The budget

560
00:41:44,952 --> 00:41:48,202
for the New Seoul Town project is five trillion won  ($5B) ,

561
00:41:48,202 --> 00:41:52,761
which means we can stash much more money away as a slush fund.

562
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:55,532
Then you joined Soonyang Construction because...

563
00:41:57,031 --> 00:42:01,171
I know I always made you anxious, just like now.

564
00:42:02,012 --> 00:42:05,912
That you'd fall out of favor with Grandpa because of me.

565
00:42:05,912 --> 00:42:09,591
You were afraid I'd ruin your plan to succeed the throne.

566
00:42:11,012 --> 00:42:14,151
- Seong Jun, that's... 
 - Father.

567
00:42:15,921 --> 00:42:19,222
Now, I can really understand you.

568
00:42:20,092 --> 00:42:23,262
I feel exactly the same way right now.

569
00:42:52,922 --> 00:42:56,350
   

570
00:42:57,522 --> 00:42:59,161
   

571
00:42:59,161 --> 00:43:00,431
   

572
00:43:00,431 --> 00:43:01,632
   

573
00:43:01,632 --> 00:43:02,931
   

574
00:43:02,931 --> 00:43:04,271
   

575
00:43:04,271 --> 00:43:07,620
   

576
00:43:18,881 --> 00:43:20,881
It's me, Jin Seong Jun.

577
00:43:20,881 --> 00:43:24,521
You didn't want to bet your future on me just because of Soonyang.

578
00:43:25,392 --> 00:43:28,392
Then how about you get to know me better and decide?

579
00:43:51,711 --> 00:43:54,122
Do you like that spot?

580
00:43:54,851 --> 00:43:56,222
Was her name Kim Yeon Soo?

581
00:43:56,222 --> 00:43:59,361
The lead actress in the weekend drama, "Women of the Sauna."

582
00:43:59,361 --> 00:44:02,561
She always sat there too.

583
00:44:09,001 --> 00:44:10,902
Oh, here.

584
00:44:15,872 --> 00:44:18,172
I've never seen this before.

585
00:44:19,042 --> 00:44:22,082
Oh, right. Yoon Ji Na must've left it here...

586
00:44:22,082 --> 00:44:25,882
when she was in a rush to get to "Top 10 Songs" on time.

587
00:44:30,021 --> 00:44:32,151
What about this glass?

588
00:44:32,151 --> 00:44:34,522
Who else used this?

589
00:44:35,262 --> 00:44:37,862
How would I remember everyone who's used it?

590
00:44:42,631 --> 00:44:47,142
So why did you make me come all the way to Incheon?

591
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:59,922
You already know what kind of upbringing I had.

592
00:44:59,922 --> 00:45:02,022
This was like my playground.

593
00:45:02,022 --> 00:45:05,951
I've played with it plenty of times, so I don't need it anymore.

594
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:10,531
What do you say? Would you accept it?

595
00:45:10,531 --> 00:45:16,362
I've officially joined the company, and I feel that I can start afresh with you.

596
00:45:38,691 --> 00:45:45,821
So you're not photogenic, and you're a terrible actor.

597
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:48,971
You're Soonyang's third-generation heir.

598
00:45:48,971 --> 00:45:52,842
You can easily buy yourself another playground like this.

599
00:45:52,842 --> 00:45:58,602
Did you actually think you could deceive me like this?

600
00:46:00,312 --> 00:46:06,181
If you want to marry me, it can't be because of me.

601
00:46:06,181 --> 00:46:10,791
I bet it's because of your grandpa, Chairman Jin Yang Cheol.

602
00:46:15,322 --> 00:46:17,532
What's wrong with that?

603
00:46:17,532 --> 00:46:20,862
I must do my very best to win my grandfather over.

604
00:46:20,862 --> 00:46:26,431
A devoted husband, model father, and successful businessman.

605
00:46:26,431 --> 00:46:29,791
I thought that was the kind of married life you wanted.

606
00:46:31,841 --> 00:46:34,581
What more do you need? Tell me.

607
00:46:36,111 --> 00:46:40,522
You hardly know me.

608
00:46:42,392 --> 00:46:47,892
If we knew everything about each other, we wouldn't want to get married.

609
00:46:49,492 --> 00:46:52,831
You, Ms. Mo Hyeon Min, intrigue me.

610
00:46:59,501 --> 00:47:04,912
If we wanted to land the New Seoul Town project,

611
00:47:04,912 --> 00:47:09,512
we'd have to see eye to eye with the next mayor of Seoul.

612
00:47:11,211 --> 00:47:13,281
When does the nomination period begin?

613
00:47:13,281 --> 00:47:18,222
The floor leaders of the leading and opposition parties are waiting for your call, sir.

614
00:47:18,222 --> 00:47:21,041
Is it not my money they're waiting for?

615
00:47:22,031 --> 00:47:24,131
They wouldn't give the project to a different company

616
00:47:24,131 --> 00:47:26,832
after getting your money for their campaign, right?

617
00:47:26,832 --> 00:47:31,702
Do you know why you must be careful when you spend someone else's money?

618
00:47:32,242 --> 00:47:36,042
The money I gave them isn't why they must listen to me.

619
00:47:36,042 --> 00:47:38,412
They have no choice but to do as I say

620
00:47:38,412 --> 00:47:42,151
because I have leverage over them since they received money from me.

621
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:45,051
So it's a stick and not a carrot, after all.

622
00:47:48,352 --> 00:47:50,992
Choose one.

623
00:47:52,191 --> 00:47:55,592
Who has the look of the next mayor of Seoul?

624
00:48:06,441 --> 00:48:10,171
Oh! Prosecutor Choi Chang Je, right?

625
00:48:10,171 --> 00:48:12,182
- Who are you? 
 - What a coincidence!

626
00:48:12,182 --> 00:48:15,581
I really wanted to meet you. Who knew I'd run into you here?

627
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:26,901
You know about Mayor Giuliani of New York, right?

628
00:48:26,901 --> 00:48:29,432
He was a prosecutor who came from nothing.

629
00:48:29,432 --> 00:48:31,961
Thanks to him, who fought against corruption,

630
00:48:31,961 --> 00:48:34,931
New York was reborn as a top city in the world.

631
00:48:34,931 --> 00:48:40,832
Just like New York has Giuliani, Seoul needs Mayor Choi Chang Je.

632
00:48:44,272 --> 00:48:48,842
A young, competent mayor who is perfect for Seoul.

633
00:48:49,512 --> 00:48:52,421
You're definitely not from the political circle.

634
00:48:52,421 --> 00:48:53,921
Oh...

635
00:48:54,722 --> 00:48:59,222
I'm Oh Se Hyeon from Miracle Investment.

636
00:49:00,892 --> 00:49:05,291
I'd like to sponsor your campaign, Mr. Choi.

637
00:49:06,431 --> 00:49:09,181
   

638
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,931
"Miracle?"

639
00:49:16,542 --> 00:49:19,372
We cannot accept Miracle's support.

640
00:49:19,372 --> 00:49:25,181
Besides, you want the New Seoul Town project, which Soonyang Construction is after?

641
00:49:25,181 --> 00:49:31,721
CEO Oh, this is like declaring war on my father, Chairman Jin Yang Cheol.

642
00:49:32,592 --> 00:49:37,392
Never in my life have I seen anyone win against him.

643
00:49:37,392 --> 00:49:41,761
All will be fine if Chairman Jin never finds out about this.

644
00:49:41,761 --> 00:49:43,702
Am I wrong?

645
00:49:46,001 --> 00:49:50,802
I plan to take this to my grave.

646
00:49:50,802 --> 00:49:53,912
   

647
00:50:07,522 --> 00:50:09,992
So we're perfect partners now,

648
00:50:09,992 --> 00:50:12,691
since we share a secret.

649
00:50:14,102 --> 00:50:18,231
Then we must add on a little extra as hazard pay.

650
00:50:20,602 --> 00:50:25,212
As for the amount, instead of 10 billion won  ($10M) , make it 20 billion won  ($20M) .

651
00:50:27,512 --> 00:50:31,512
You sure take after your father.

652
00:50:33,422 --> 00:50:40,551
But the thing is, will the party nominate me?

653
00:50:40,551 --> 00:50:43,892
Those at Cheongwadae are tight,

654
00:50:43,892 --> 00:50:45,291
and people should know you

655
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:47,461
if you want the spotlight at the confirmation hearing,

656
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:48,362
but I'm...

657
00:50:48,362 --> 00:50:52,212
You reflect the spirit of the times, Prosecutor Choi.

658
00:50:52,212 --> 00:50:54,671
It's a quality that a politician absolutely needs.

659
00:50:54,671 --> 00:50:57,912
The spirit of the times...

660
00:50:58,671 --> 00:51:00,311
I do?

661
00:51:01,341 --> 00:51:03,011
- Yes! 
 - Yes?

662
00:51:03,011 --> 00:51:04,711
Yes!

663
00:51:11,921 --> 00:51:14,662
While investigating the family of Jea Construction's owner

664
00:51:14,662 --> 00:51:16,892
for dereliction of duty and embezzlement,

665
00:51:16,892 --> 00:51:18,631
the Seoul District Public Prosecutors' Office

666
00:51:18,631 --> 00:51:22,161
 confirmed that CEO Kang Man Soo illegally siphoned off 36 billion won  ($36M)  overseas. 

667
00:51:22,161 --> 00:51:24,332
 We've also requested an arrest warrant for Kim Jong Bok, 

668
00:51:24,332 --> 00:51:26,242
 the Commissioner of the Korea Customs Service, 

669
00:51:26,242 --> 00:51:28,642
 for deliberately concealing this. 

670
00:51:28,642 --> 00:51:31,272
This is clearly a corruption case caused by abuse of power.

671
00:51:31,272 --> 00:51:34,481
We, at the Prosecution Service, promise not to give in to any kind of external pressure

672
00:51:34,481 --> 00:51:39,181
and investigate the case until the end.

673
00:51:39,181 --> 00:51:40,282
That'd be all.

674
00:51:40,282 --> 00:51:43,151
   

675
00:51:43,151 --> 00:51:44,992
Prosecutor Choi! While you are investigating an incumbent minister,

676
00:51:44,992 --> 00:51:46,591
wasn't there any external pressure?

677
00:51:46,591 --> 00:51:49,332
You also investigated the cases involving Ahjin and Hando Steel.

678
00:51:49,332 --> 00:51:51,762
You're a member of the Soonyang family. Did anyone try to bribe you?

679
00:51:51,762 --> 00:51:54,331
Is there a reason you mainly handle corporate crime cases?

680
00:51:54,331 --> 00:51:55,832
Have you experienced any external pressure?

681
00:51:55,832 --> 00:51:57,531
- Just a comment, please! 
 - Say a few words!

682
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,831
The spirit of the times?

683
00:51:59,831 --> 00:52:04,042
Since the financial crisis, everyone's been talking about sharing the pain.

684
00:52:04,811 --> 00:52:08,142
But they aren't the ones who caused this pain.

685
00:52:10,151 --> 00:52:14,052
Why are the powerless citizens the only ones suffering?

686
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:21,852
Why is it that the powerless citizens are the only ones suffering?

687
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:27,392
That is not justice.

688
00:52:29,672 --> 00:52:32,472
   

689
00:52:33,242 --> 00:52:35,271
   

690
00:52:35,271 --> 00:52:37,612
   

691
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:41,841
   

692
00:52:43,981 --> 00:52:47,352
All the shares that once belonged to CEO Kang Man Soo and his family

693
00:52:47,352 --> 00:52:50,122
got absorbed back to the company.

694
00:52:50,122 --> 00:52:54,351
We've become the major shareholder with just five percent of the shares.

695
00:52:54,351 --> 00:52:57,431
This also means we can participate in the New Seoul Town project.

696
00:52:57,431 --> 00:53:01,401
Hold on. Did we use Choi Chang Je to get Jea Construction?

697
00:53:01,401 --> 00:53:04,772
Or did we use Jea Construction to catapult Choi Chang Je to fame?

698
00:53:04,772 --> 00:53:08,401
What matters is that we already have Jea in the palm of our hand.

699
00:53:08,401 --> 00:53:14,112
And soon, we will also own the mayor of Seoul.

700
00:53:16,452 --> 00:53:19,452
 Choi Chang Je from the Seoul District Public Prosecutors' Office, 

701
00:53:19,452 --> 00:53:23,251
who has received strong support in pre-mayoral election polls,

702
00:53:23,251 --> 00:53:25,622
has announced that he was embarking on a political career.

703
00:53:25,622 --> 00:53:29,062
All eyes are on whether or not this son-in-law

704
00:53:29,062 --> 00:53:33,462
 of the Soonyang Group family will be nominated as a mayoral candidate. 

705
00:53:33,462 --> 00:53:38,832
 I will stand with my fellow citizens, with my fellow citizens of Seoul. 

706
00:53:46,441 --> 00:53:51,351
Those in the ruling party are supporting the other two candidates.

707
00:53:51,351 --> 00:53:53,122
What do you think, Do Jun?

708
00:53:53,122 --> 00:53:56,122
Who do you think is behind Uncle Chang Je?

709
00:53:56,122 --> 00:53:57,821
I'm not sure.

710
00:53:57,821 --> 00:54:00,922
I have no interest in politics.

711
00:54:00,922 --> 00:54:05,162
Grandfather will soon find out whom he's up against.

712
00:54:05,162 --> 00:54:07,401
He won't let them have their way.

713
00:54:07,401 --> 00:54:09,931
Uncle Chang Je and those in politics.

714
00:54:09,931 --> 00:54:13,101
   

715
00:54:16,012 --> 00:54:19,162
Mr. Kim Seong Hwan from the ruling party is on the phone.

716
00:54:22,981 --> 00:54:25,482
Hello. It's me, Jin Yang Cheol.

717
00:54:25,482 --> 00:54:28,251
Yes, Chairman. Right. 
    

718
00:54:28,251 --> 00:54:30,251
It's been a while, Sir.

719
00:54:30,251 --> 00:54:32,622
I heard reporters at Hyunsung Daily

720
00:54:32,622 --> 00:54:36,761
got their hands on some confidential documents at our research institute.

721
00:54:36,761 --> 00:54:39,462
Hando Steel, Ahjin Motors.

722
00:54:39,462 --> 00:54:40,602
   

723
00:54:40,602 --> 00:54:42,802
What do you mean, Sir?

724
00:54:42,802 --> 00:54:47,042
Everyone is saying Chang Je was ordered by Soonyang

725
00:54:47,042 --> 00:54:50,011
to deliberately launch the investigation.

726
00:54:50,011 --> 00:54:53,682
I heard it'd be on the front page of the newspapers tomorrow morning.

727
00:54:53,682 --> 00:54:56,912
Once the article is published,

728
00:54:56,912 --> 00:55:00,312
all the voters will turn away from the ruling party.

729
00:55:01,681 --> 00:55:04,021
- Lower your voice, honey. 
 - Then just go home!

730
00:55:04,021 --> 00:55:05,691
Honey, this isn't a good idea...

731
00:55:05,691 --> 00:55:08,161
- I told you not to follow me! 
 - Okay, all right. Slow down.

732
00:55:08,161 --> 00:55:09,362
Have you no pride?

733
00:55:09,362 --> 00:55:10,992
- It's just that... 
 - Be quiet!

734
00:55:10,992 --> 00:55:12,861
Please, honey. It's nothing...

735
00:55:12,861 --> 00:55:15,162
Be quiet! Just go home!

736
00:55:15,162 --> 00:55:16,832
Gosh, honey. Wait.

737
00:55:16,832 --> 00:55:19,241
- I told you not to follow me! 
 - Honey, but still...

738
00:55:19,241 --> 00:55:21,072
- Does this even make sense? 
 - Calm down.

739
00:55:21,072 --> 00:55:25,111
What kind of father ruins his own children's future?

740
00:55:25,111 --> 00:55:26,881
Some fathers do. Don't cry.

741
00:55:26,881 --> 00:55:29,551
My dear Hwa Young, don't cry. My sweet Hwa Young.

742
00:55:29,551 --> 00:55:32,381
All right, that's enough. This will only stir things up.

743
00:55:32,381 --> 00:55:33,582
Let's go. Come on.

744
00:55:33,582 --> 00:55:34,881
- Let's go home. 
 - Honey, let go.

745
00:55:34,881 --> 00:55:35,852
What? Okay, look.

746
00:55:35,852 --> 00:55:38,191
I must talk to Father and settle this matter once and for all.

747
00:55:38,191 --> 00:55:40,861
Honey, calm down. You're too worked up right now.

748
00:55:40,861 --> 00:55:43,162
What are you doing here?

749
00:55:43,162 --> 00:55:45,931
Honey, it's Do Jun. It's okay.

750
00:55:45,931 --> 00:55:51,132
If you're here to see Grandpa, Uncle Chang Je should go upstairs alone.

751
00:55:51,132 --> 00:55:55,142
- What did you say? 
 - Must you be like this, too?

752
00:55:55,142 --> 00:56:00,742
If Auntie Hwa Young tagged along, Grandpa would just see you as his son-in-law.

753
00:56:00,742 --> 00:56:03,741
Not as a mayoral candidate.

754
00:56:03,741 --> 00:56:06,512
My son-in-law Chang Je, you're here.

755
00:56:06,512 --> 00:56:09,281
   

756
00:56:09,281 --> 00:56:11,822
Are you done having fun?

757
00:56:17,392 --> 00:56:20,931
Once the article comes out tomorrow morning,

758
00:56:22,301 --> 00:56:28,831
you'll have to stop pretending to be a righteous prosecutor.

759
00:56:29,671 --> 00:56:32,842
Don't take it to heart, though.

760
00:56:32,842 --> 00:56:38,112
I'll open a law firm for you now that you've left the prosecution.

761
00:56:39,251 --> 00:56:42,222
You're right, Father.

762
00:56:42,222 --> 00:56:46,151
I should stop pretending to be a righteous prosecutor.

763
00:56:47,392 --> 00:56:51,461
I plan to do it properly from now on.

764
00:56:53,231 --> 00:56:56,932
I'll be a hunter who goes after the conglomerates.

765
00:57:00,972 --> 00:57:03,672
About Soonyang Life Science, Father,

766
00:57:03,672 --> 00:57:07,671
the real reason they liquidated all the assets in the midst of the "Big Deal" negotiations.

767
00:57:07,671 --> 00:57:10,412
The slush fund needed for Soonyang's unlawful succession was the reason.

768
00:57:10,412 --> 00:57:14,581
Why? Will you tell the prosecution?

769
00:57:22,961 --> 00:57:28,562
Do you think they'll side with you?

770
00:57:28,562 --> 00:57:32,802
Which is why I plan to hold a press conference as soon as I leave Jeongsimjae.

771
00:57:32,802 --> 00:57:35,641
It'll be broadcast live on the Internet.

772
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:42,441
As the conglomerate hunter and your son-in-law, I plan to tell the truth.

773
00:57:46,852 --> 00:57:52,521
Do you think public opinion will side with you, Father?

774
00:58:14,611 --> 00:58:20,081
They say you can never win against your children.

775
00:58:21,952 --> 00:58:24,602
My son-in-law is my child, too, after all.

776
00:58:27,222 --> 00:58:29,961
How could I win against you?

777
00:58:34,461 --> 00:58:41,971
Then I need you to promise me something.

778
00:59:03,792 --> 00:59:06,262
Nephew, you were right.

779
00:59:06,262 --> 00:59:09,231
I did exactly as you said, and he gave me the go-ahead.

780
00:59:09,231 --> 00:59:11,332
Grandpa...

781
00:59:11,332 --> 00:59:13,522
- Grandpa gave you the go-ahead? 
 - Yes.

782
00:59:14,202 --> 00:59:15,742
That's great. Congratulations, Uncle Chang Je.

783
00:59:15,742 --> 00:59:17,272
Gosh, thanks.

784
00:59:17,272 --> 00:59:19,842
- Best of luck. 
 - Thanks.

785
00:59:20,481 --> 00:59:22,582
- Hey, nephew. 
 - Yes?

786
00:59:22,582 --> 00:59:26,512
I didn't think you'd help me.

787
00:59:26,512 --> 00:59:29,651
Why did you help me?

788
00:59:32,051 --> 00:59:35,251
Well, the title of mayor of Seoul suits you better

789
00:59:35,251 --> 00:59:38,392
than a mere son-in-law of the Soonyang family,

790
00:59:39,191 --> 00:59:40,931
Uncle Chang Je.

791
00:59:57,781 --> 01:00:01,452
Did you give him the go-ahead to run for mayor?

792
01:00:02,952 --> 01:00:05,522
Will that be all right, Sir?

793
01:00:06,691 --> 01:00:08,791
What can I do?

794
01:00:10,662 --> 01:00:18,112
I shall try to use the poultry knife to butcher a cow.

795
01:00:25,312 --> 01:00:30,582
Someone's got Chang Je's back.

796
01:00:31,881 --> 01:00:37,331
Hang Jae, I need you to find out who it is,

797
01:00:37,331 --> 01:00:41,562
and why they're trying to make Chang Je the mayor of Seoul.

798
01:00:42,791 --> 01:00:44,641
   

799
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,062
 Seoul, Choi Chang Je. 53.6 percent. 

800
01:00:47,062 --> 01:00:49,262
 Yang Doo Yeong, 41.7 percent. 

801
01:00:49,262 --> 01:00:50,731
- Yes! 
 - Yes.

802
01:00:50,731 --> 01:00:52,401
 Six from the United Liberal Democrats. 

803
01:00:52,401 --> 01:00:53,971
 Four from the Korea Party. 

804
01:00:53,971 --> 01:00:55,142
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

805
01:00:55,142 --> 01:00:56,642
Cheers.

806
01:00:56,642 --> 01:01:00,811
 Choi Chang Je from the New Democratic Korea Party has won the election. 

807
01:01:00,811 --> 01:01:02,952
Now that we have the mayor of Seoul on our side,

808
01:01:02,952 --> 01:01:04,912
we just need Mayor Choi

809
01:01:04,912 --> 01:01:10,251
to give the New Seoul Town project to us, Jaea Construction.

810
01:01:10,251 --> 01:01:12,822
We can trust him, right?

811
01:01:12,822 --> 01:01:14,522
I mean, we're dealing with Jin Yang Cheol here.

812
01:01:14,522 --> 01:01:18,230
Mayor Choi is a softie. Would he be able to handle him?

813
01:01:19,272 --> 01:01:23,231
My gosh. Congratulations, Chang Je.

814
01:01:23,231 --> 01:01:25,172
But as you know,

815
01:01:25,172 --> 01:01:28,972
you are and will always be my one and only son-in-law

816
01:01:28,972 --> 01:01:33,572
whom I'm very proud of, no matter where you are or what you do.

817
01:01:33,572 --> 01:01:35,012
Don't forget that.

818
01:01:35,012 --> 01:01:37,512
 Thank you. I'll never forget that. 

819
01:01:37,512 --> 01:01:40,122
 - Choi Chang Je! 
 - Hurrah! 

820
01:01:40,122 --> 01:01:41,851
 - Hurrah! 
 - Hurrah! 

821
01:01:41,851 --> 01:01:44,992
 - Mayor of Seoul, Choi Chang Je! 
 - Mayor of Seoul, Choi Chang Je! 

822
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:46,840
 - Yes! 
 - Mayor Choi Chang Je! 

823
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:51,050
   

824
01:02:01,272 --> 01:02:03,242
As for the New Seoul Town project,

825
01:02:03,242 --> 01:02:04,841
the bidding results should've been announced already.

826
01:02:04,841 --> 01:02:09,212
But Junior Managing Director Jin Seong Jun hasn't called yet, Sir.

827
01:02:09,212 --> 01:02:11,751
There he is.

828
01:02:19,551 --> 01:02:21,722
So how did it go?

829
01:02:22,461 --> 01:02:25,411
The New Seoul Town development project

830
01:02:28,432 --> 01:02:31,101
has gone to Jea Construction.

831
01:02:32,671 --> 01:02:34,371
Sir.

832
01:02:43,211 --> 01:02:46,282
Tell Son-in-law Chang Je that I want to see him.

833
01:03:34,702 --> 01:03:36,961
You're here.

834
01:03:43,372 --> 01:03:48,282
I wanted to wait outside to welcome the new mayor.

835
01:03:48,941 --> 01:03:51,381
Let's go inside.

836
01:03:51,381 --> 01:03:55,122
Why don't we just talk here?

837
01:04:04,031 --> 01:04:08,962
My new job is keeping me busy, Father.

838
01:04:14,842 --> 01:04:16,442
Who is it?

839
01:04:18,211 --> 01:04:22,840
Who is backing you that you can be this arrogant?

840
01:04:25,912 --> 01:04:30,981
You gave the New Seoul Town project to Jea Construction.

841
01:04:30,981 --> 01:04:33,342
Did that person put you up to it?

842
01:04:36,162 --> 01:04:39,432
The person behind you.

843
01:04:44,231 --> 01:04:46,472
Is it Miracle?

844
01:04:52,272 --> 01:04:55,182
I guess you didn't know.

845
01:04:56,582 --> 01:05:04,532
The people who have my back are... the ten million citizens of Seoul.

846
01:05:06,351 --> 01:05:07,691
What?

847
01:05:07,691 --> 01:05:10,631
As the mayor of Seoul, I chose Jea Construction

848
01:05:10,631 --> 01:05:12,761
over Soonyang according to the fair rules and procedures,

849
01:05:12,761 --> 01:05:15,932
for the sake of Seoul's better future.

850
01:05:17,102 --> 01:05:20,431
Should you have any other official questions,

851
01:05:20,431 --> 01:05:24,372
I will see you in my office next time, Chairman.

852
01:05:55,671 --> 01:06:00,841
Jea Construction got the New Seoul Town project?

853
01:06:03,912 --> 01:06:06,562
It was Mr. Jin Seong Jun's first project.

854
01:06:06,562 --> 01:06:08,122
He must be very disappointed.

855
01:06:08,122 --> 01:06:11,392
And I guess he's preparing to go study abroad or something.

856
01:06:11,392 --> 01:06:14,322
He frequents a language institute.

857
01:06:22,961 --> 01:06:24,701
That's interesting.

858
01:06:24,701 --> 01:06:28,841
Miracle Investment has control over Jea Construction.

859
01:06:28,841 --> 01:06:32,951
Miracle and Jin Do Jun's language institute are in the same building.

860
01:06:35,041 --> 01:06:40,882
I believe in fate but not in coincidences.

861
01:06:41,821 --> 01:06:42,881
We're from the prosecution.

862
01:06:42,881 --> 01:06:45,222
We're here to conduct a search and seizure.

863
01:06:45,222 --> 01:06:46,892
- Search the office. 
 - Yes, Sir.

864
01:06:46,892 --> 01:06:49,292
- Start over there. 
 - Over here.

865
01:06:51,831 --> 01:06:54,262
Excuse me. Who are you?

866
01:06:54,262 --> 01:06:56,362
Is Mr. Oh Se Hyeon here?

867
01:06:56,362 --> 01:06:58,271
What is this about?

868
01:06:58,271 --> 01:07:00,872
We're from the Seoul District Public Prosecutors' Office.

869
01:07:00,872 --> 01:07:03,972
We received a tip-off that you paid a large bribe

870
01:07:03,972 --> 01:07:09,072
to Mayor Choi Chang Je to land the New Seoul Town project.

871
01:07:16,722 --> 01:07:21,410
   

872
01:07:42,311 --> 01:07:46,981
My, Soonyang sure has a lot of power.

873
01:07:46,981 --> 01:07:50,322
Even prosecutors are at their beck and call.

874
01:07:51,451 --> 01:07:53,601
What do you want from me?

875
01:07:54,321 --> 01:08:00,121
Chairman Jin wants to meet the majority shareholder of Miracle.

876
01:08:00,901 --> 01:08:02,901
The real owner of the company.

877
01:08:55,182 --> 01:08:58,151
You know Miracle Investment, right?

878
01:08:59,091 --> 01:09:05,792
Then do you also know who the company's real owner is?

879
01:09:05,792 --> 01:09:08,712
You're talking like you know who it is.

880
01:09:08,712 --> 01:09:10,601
Who is it?

881
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:06,701
I'm Miracle's majority shareholder,

882
01:11:07,551 --> 01:11:09,752
Jin Do Jun.

883
01:11:18,961 --> 01:11:24,110
   

884
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:32,000


885
01:11:53,431 --> 01:11:57,201
 Why? Why did you do such a thing? 

886
01:11:57,201 --> 01:12:01,671
 I'd like to buy... Soonyang. 

887
01:12:01,671 --> 01:12:03,542
 I'm worried. 

888
01:12:03,542 --> 01:12:06,071
 He will try to drag me down throughout my term. 

889
01:12:06,071 --> 01:12:10,360
 Then soar high enough so he can't drag you down. 

890
01:12:11,741 --> 01:12:15,751
 Be honest with me. You're not 22, right? 

891
01:12:15,751 --> 01:12:18,152
 You said partners must be honest with each other. 

892
01:12:18,152 --> 01:12:21,622
 We'll be good partners. 

893
01:12:21,622 --> 01:12:25,891
 It sure is an offer I can't refuse. 

894
01:12:25,891 --> 01:12:27,702
 We've got a problem. 

895
01:12:27,702 --> 01:12:31,602
 They contacted us and said they'd cancel the plan to enter DMC altogether. 

896
01:12:31,602 --> 01:12:37,090
 My eldest grandson, do you want to get your revenge? 

897
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:43,280
♫  Love for me forever  ♫
