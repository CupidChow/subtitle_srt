1
00:00:00,276 --> 00:00:02,846
Hyeon Min, you look absolutely stunning today. 
   

2
00:00:02,846 --> 00:00:05,345
Yes, she really does.

3
00:00:05,345 --> 00:00:08,016
Of course, you'd expect nothing less from the Soonyang family.

4
00:00:08,016 --> 00:00:09,386
That must be several carats.

5
00:00:09,386 --> 00:00:13,186
- What about your honeymoon? 
  - Here comes the groom-to-be! 

6
00:00:13,186 --> 00:00:16,096
 Here comes the groom-to-be! 

7
00:00:16,096 --> 00:00:18,755
-  Here comes the groom-to-be!  
- Oh, my.

8
00:00:18,755 --> 00:00:19,895
Stop. Don't go any further.

9
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:22,325
- We'll stop here. 
 - Oh, dear. I'm thirsty.

10
00:00:22,325 --> 00:00:24,136
- Come in and have a drink. 
 - No, we should...

11
00:00:24,136 --> 00:00:26,266
- Feed us first. 
 - Come on, guys.

12
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:27,306
- Hurry up. 
 - Let's just go.

13
00:00:27,306 --> 00:00:30,305
- Gosh, hold on. 
 - Keep it down!

14
00:00:30,305 --> 00:00:31,576
- The thing is... 
 - Come on. Let's go.

15
00:00:31,576 --> 00:00:33,145
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

16
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,960


17
00:00:47,285 --> 00:00:50,896
 Father, Seong Jun and his friends delivered all the wedding gifts. 

18
00:00:50,896 --> 00:00:54,096
They're having a feast at his in-laws' place...

19
00:01:00,966 --> 00:01:02,165
When did you get here?

20
00:01:02,165 --> 00:01:03,975
I was on my way home after playing golf.

21
00:01:03,975 --> 00:01:07,305
But I was starving, so I thought I should stop by.

22
00:01:07,305 --> 00:01:09,246
Your son is getting married.

23
00:01:09,246 --> 00:01:12,045
You must be so happy that you don't even have to eat.

24
00:01:12,045 --> 00:01:14,545
Oh, Father.

25
00:01:14,545 --> 00:01:18,285
Have you prepared a wedding gift for your eldest grandson?

26
00:01:22,255 --> 00:01:24,825
Will you give him shares in Soonyang Corporation?

27
00:01:28,096 --> 00:01:30,135
How many?

28
00:01:30,135 --> 00:01:33,365
I'm sure Father will just take care of it.

29
00:01:34,035 --> 00:01:35,936
Why are you worried about it?

30
00:01:35,936 --> 00:01:40,005
Well, I'm Seong Jun's uncle.

31
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:42,276
If my gift is too little compared to his grandfather's,

32
00:01:42,276 --> 00:01:45,075
I'll be embarrassed.

33
00:01:45,075 --> 00:01:47,016
Right, Father?

34
00:01:50,616 --> 00:01:53,386
The radish kimchi is perfectly ripe.

35
00:01:54,255 --> 00:01:57,496
It looks like a good person will become a member of our family.

36
00:01:59,626 --> 00:02:01,265
Father.

37
00:02:11,406 --> 00:02:13,175
Can I have more water?

38
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:15,476
I got it.

39
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:23,445
What is it?

40
00:02:23,445 --> 00:02:25,516
Seong Jun...

41
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:30,026
is now backed by his in-laws, who are influential people.

42
00:02:30,026 --> 00:02:32,326
So you need not worry about him.

43
00:02:33,966 --> 00:02:35,726
Father...

44
00:02:37,035 --> 00:02:40,566
will start working on grooming Seong Jun as his successor.

45
00:02:42,635 --> 00:02:45,105
After all, that is the family's rule.

46
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:48,605
Primogeniture.

47
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:59,485
 We found a brain arteriovenous malformation, Sir. 

48
00:02:59,485 --> 00:03:01,625
   

49
00:03:02,586 --> 00:03:07,455
 The location is risky if we perform surgery. 

50
00:03:08,925 --> 00:03:11,135
   

51
00:03:42,066 --> 00:03:44,035
Yes, Mr. Oh.

52
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,390
   

53
00:03:51,005 --> 00:03:53,176
Let's just give up, Fellow Korean Lad.

54
00:03:54,005 --> 00:03:57,275
I was wrong about DMC.

55
00:03:57,275 --> 00:04:00,385
Like HBO and CNN, I thought cable channels

56
00:04:00,385 --> 00:04:03,586
would soon beat the national networks.

57
00:04:03,586 --> 00:04:06,385
But it can only happen in large countries with a population of 100 million, like the US.

58
00:04:06,385 --> 00:04:08,285
No, you're wrong.

59
00:04:08,285 --> 00:04:10,955
It may take some time, but that day will come soon.

60
00:04:10,955 --> 00:04:13,195
The day when cable networks and various other channels

61
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:16,726
would produce content that would put national TV to shame. I know it.

62
00:04:16,726 --> 00:04:19,606
It's not a time to give such a leisurely spiel like a prophet.

63
00:04:19,606 --> 00:04:21,006
We must be objective and face our reality.

64
00:04:21,006 --> 00:04:23,265
Objectively speaking, our reality is that

65
00:04:23,265 --> 00:04:27,975
the moment we give up on DMC, Jin Seong Jun will be confirmed for the throne at Soonyang

66
00:04:27,975 --> 00:04:32,845
Then our plan to own Soonyang will be nothing but a leisurely delusion.

67
00:04:32,845 --> 00:04:35,085
I refuse to give up on DMC.

68
00:04:38,116 --> 00:04:40,986
Buy and Sell Home Shopping, the only profitable cable channel,

69
00:04:40,986 --> 00:04:43,955
decided today that they'd sell off the company.

70
00:04:43,955 --> 00:04:46,596
Do you still not understand what it means?

71
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:50,336
 Hyung, it's not like you need a lot of stuff. 

72
00:04:50,336 --> 00:04:54,436
 Hey, shopping isn't about buying things you need. 

73
00:04:54,436 --> 00:04:57,406
 It's all about buying things you want. 

74
00:05:04,775 --> 00:05:07,486
It means the channel needs a new owner.

75
00:05:07,486 --> 00:05:12,286
And it's time for us to decide who it should be.

76
00:05:13,986 --> 00:05:15,786
Mason, you never disappoint.

77
00:05:15,786 --> 00:05:17,295
What's with him?

78
00:05:17,295 --> 00:05:19,926
- Where are you going? Hey! 
 - Come with me!

79
00:05:25,835 --> 00:05:29,005
Are you sure we can meet him here?

80
00:05:29,005 --> 00:05:31,606
According to his official schedule, he's abroad on a business trip now.

81
00:05:31,606 --> 00:05:37,205
I bet he doesn't want anyone to know that he's staying here.

82
00:05:41,516 --> 00:05:44,756
   

83
00:05:44,756 --> 00:05:49,756
If it's top secret, how did you find out?

84
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:56,825
   

85
00:05:56,825 --> 00:06:00,305
   

86
00:06:07,275 --> 00:06:13,476
What I thought was my grandfather's warning turned out to be a lottery ticket.

87
00:06:13,476 --> 00:06:18,115
And an unscratched one, at that.

88
00:06:20,226 --> 00:06:21,555
Let's go.

89
00:06:21,555 --> 00:06:23,995
   

90
00:06:25,496 --> 00:06:27,566
Allow me to introduce myself, Chairman.

91
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:29,526
I am Jin Do Jun.

92
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:37,206
Chairman Jin's youngest grandson?

93
00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:40,075
Yes, I thought you looked familiar.

94
00:06:40,075 --> 00:06:43,276
I heard you went to Seoul National University School of Law.

95
00:06:45,015 --> 00:06:49,115
I told them over and over not to let anyone in.

96
00:06:49,115 --> 00:06:50,955
How did you get in?

97
00:06:51,755 --> 00:06:54,926
Hey! Is anybody outside?

98
00:07:02,426 --> 00:07:04,095
Those fools...

99
00:07:04,095 --> 00:07:06,995
Your security team did nothing wrong, Sir.

100
00:07:09,405 --> 00:07:11,506
I struck a deal with them.

101
00:07:13,876 --> 00:07:16,246
I told them I'd send out a promotional press release

102
00:07:17,176 --> 00:07:20,645
if they didn't let me see you.

103
00:07:21,715 --> 00:07:23,485
Ju Yeong Il, the chairman of Daeyoung Group,

104
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,956
is undergoing artificial heart valve surgery,

105
00:07:25,956 --> 00:07:28,526
but he chose

106
00:07:29,255 --> 00:07:32,426
Soonyang Medical Center, not Daeyoung Medical Center.

107
00:07:33,926 --> 00:07:38,235
There is no better way to prove that Soonyang has

108
00:07:39,365 --> 00:07:42,235
the best cardiothoracic surgery department in the country.

109
00:07:43,676 --> 00:07:46,375
Chairman Jin, that old snake.

110
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,906
He promised me that it'd be kept confidential.

111
00:07:49,906 --> 00:07:53,316
How dare he blindside me like this? Darn it.

112
00:08:02,286 --> 00:08:05,325
My grandfather doesn't know that I'm here, Sir.

113
00:08:05,325 --> 00:08:10,095
And it should stay that way,

114
00:08:11,495 --> 00:08:14,336
because I'm here to tell you how Daeyoung Distribution

115
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:18,275
can beat Soonyang Transportation and become number one

116
00:08:20,445 --> 00:08:23,075
in the industry, Sir.

117
00:08:33,186 --> 00:08:35,756
- Congratulations. 
 - Thank you.

118
00:08:35,756 --> 00:08:36,855
Thank you.

119
00:08:36,855 --> 00:08:38,595
   

120
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:41,566
Gosh, thank you.

121
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:43,436
- Oppa Young Ki. 
 - Hi, Hwa Young.

122
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:45,495
- Hi, congratulations. 
 - Oh, my. Mr. Mayor.

123
00:08:45,495 --> 00:08:49,166
You took time out of your busy schedule to join us today.

124
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,506
- Thanks, brother-in-law Ji. 
 - It's my pleasure.

125
00:08:51,506 --> 00:08:54,145
I see that the groom's father is very excited.

126
00:08:54,145 --> 00:08:55,945
Is it because your son is getting married?

127
00:08:55,945 --> 00:08:59,275
Or is it because of Father's wedding gift?

128
00:09:02,615 --> 00:09:07,725
Gosh, Hwa Young. You have no idea because you don't have kids.

129
00:09:09,085 --> 00:09:11,926
It's better not to know. It really is.

130
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,426
I mean, look at me.

131
00:09:13,426 --> 00:09:16,565
I still have to serve my mother-in-law

132
00:09:16,565 --> 00:09:19,635
while walking on eggshells around my daughter-in-law.

133
00:09:19,635 --> 00:09:21,966
Mom has to live long.

134
00:09:21,966 --> 00:09:24,235
I'm sorry, Jeong Rae.

135
00:09:25,575 --> 00:09:27,605
Hwa Young, that is not what I meant...

136
00:09:27,605 --> 00:09:29,005
- Goodness. 
 - We'll head in first.

137
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:30,515
- Let's go. 
 - You made it, Yoon Ki.

138
00:09:30,515 --> 00:09:31,445
Congratulations.

139
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,286
- Congratulations, Jeong Rae. 
 - Thank you.

140
00:09:33,286 --> 00:09:36,586
Thank you all for coming.

141
00:09:36,586 --> 00:09:38,715
- Yes, go on in. 
 - Let's go.

142
00:09:38,715 --> 00:09:40,825
- Congratulations. 
 - Thanks.

143
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,726
- Hey! 
 - Sir.

144
00:09:45,955 --> 00:09:47,595
Thanks.

145
00:09:49,066 --> 00:09:52,536
Okay. It's my oldest nephew's wedding gift.

146
00:09:52,536 --> 00:09:53,706
I should prepare this much.

147
00:09:53,706 --> 00:09:56,066
- Move! It's our turn. 
 - All right, next.

148
00:09:56,066 --> 00:09:58,006
- She looks gorgeous. 
 - Hey, hurry.

149
00:09:58,006 --> 00:10:01,105
- Hyeon Min! You look stunning. 
 - For real!

150
00:10:01,105 --> 00:10:02,745
- Look at the camera. 
 - You look so beautiful.

151
00:10:02,745 --> 00:10:05,615
- You look absolutely gorgeous. 
 - All right. In 1, 2, 3.

152
00:10:05,615 --> 00:10:07,115
- Nice, beautiful. 
 - You look really stunning.

153
00:10:07,115 --> 00:10:09,685
- Look at the camera. 
 - Oh, my.

154
00:10:09,685 --> 00:10:10,916
Hello.

155
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,615
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

156
00:10:12,615 --> 00:10:14,525
Would you mind giving us some privacy?

157
00:10:14,525 --> 00:10:16,085
- Not at all. 
 - My gosh.

158
00:10:16,085 --> 00:10:18,195
I must tell her something.

159
00:10:18,195 --> 00:10:20,766
- My gosh! 
 - How romantic!

160
00:10:20,766 --> 00:10:22,396
- We'll leave you to it then. 
 - See you inside!

161
00:10:22,396 --> 00:10:24,366
- See you. 
 - You look so stunning today.

162
00:10:24,366 --> 00:10:27,236
- Congratulations. 
 - See you.

163
00:10:40,646 --> 00:10:45,016
You look beautiful. More beautiful than I expected.

164
00:10:48,926 --> 00:10:51,725
That's not what you wanted to talk to me about, right?

165
00:11:17,985 --> 00:11:19,956
It's such a shame.

166
00:11:21,355 --> 00:11:24,596
I want to brag about my beautiful bride.

167
00:11:26,056 --> 00:11:29,595
And you would've been so happy I came together with him.

168
00:11:29,595 --> 00:11:31,596
Who?

169
00:11:32,495 --> 00:11:34,336
Do Jun.

170
00:11:35,906 --> 00:11:37,606
Whom?

171
00:11:40,975 --> 00:11:43,475
The guy you like.

172
00:11:43,475 --> 00:11:45,476
Jin Do Jun.

173
00:12:01,695 --> 00:12:03,225
Do Jun can't come today.

174
00:12:03,225 --> 00:12:06,436
He doesn't have the guts to face my grandfather.

175
00:12:06,436 --> 00:12:09,166
You're not waiting for him, are you?

176
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,076
Stop.

177
00:12:13,306 --> 00:12:15,175
You see, Do Jun

178
00:12:15,175 --> 00:12:19,345
could not handle the DMC deal Miracle took

179
00:12:19,345 --> 00:12:21,945
and decided to hand it over to Soonyang Construction.

180
00:12:23,146 --> 00:12:24,915
This means

181
00:12:27,825 --> 00:12:31,656
that I managed to get my revenge, as you said.

182
00:12:32,355 --> 00:12:35,295
If you knew everything, then why...

183
00:12:41,965 --> 00:12:43,676
I told you.

184
00:12:43,676 --> 00:12:46,475
You truly amuse me.

185
00:12:47,575 --> 00:12:51,115
It's funny how you think you're the only one with a thinking brain.

186
00:12:51,115 --> 00:12:55,086
It's ridiculous that you think you can always have your way.

187
00:12:55,086 --> 00:12:58,485
And you believe that everyone would like you. That's...

188
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,456
I guess that's kind of cute.

189
00:13:05,095 --> 00:13:07,725
Think about it, Hyeon Min.

190
00:13:07,725 --> 00:13:11,166
The world wouldn't be so kind to only you.

191
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,096
Shut your mouth.

192
00:13:17,136 --> 00:13:21,405
Walking out the door now doesn't mean you can go back to your previous life.

193
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,475
You will just become the one whose wedding to Soonyang was called off.

194
00:13:29,715 --> 00:13:32,685
You will never be able to call off this wedding.

195
00:13:32,685 --> 00:13:35,586
You may ditch your pride as it doesn't bring you any money,

196
00:13:35,586 --> 00:13:40,226
but you can never give up on your market value as the only daughter of the Hyunsung Daily family.

197
00:13:40,226 --> 00:13:42,595
I still find you very amusing.

198
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:46,735
Is this what you wanted to talk to me about?

199
00:13:46,735 --> 00:13:49,365
- Is that why... 
 - You didn't choose me as a man,

200
00:13:49,365 --> 00:13:51,606
and the feelings are mutual.

201
00:13:51,606 --> 00:13:54,745
Let's keep things that way even after the wedding.

202
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,545
You get what I'm saying, right?

203
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:05,716
I figured you should know the rules before you joined the game.

204
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,336
Let's play fair and square.

205
00:14:25,075 --> 00:14:26,776
See you inside.

206
00:14:28,845 --> 00:14:30,475
Hello.

207
00:15:10,886 --> 00:15:13,786
Last but not least, the highlight of the ceremony awaits us.

208
00:15:13,786 --> 00:15:17,256
The bride and groom will now march together.

209
00:15:17,256 --> 00:15:24,025
Let us bless the bride and groom with a big round of applause.

210
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:26,365
Promise me one thing.

211
00:15:26,365 --> 00:15:29,936
Whatever you do, you will not dirty the family register.

212
00:15:35,605 --> 00:15:39,615
The bride and groom will now march.

213
00:16:00,566 --> 00:16:04,005
Father, you need to see this.

214
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,676
   

215
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,445
I don't think you need to worry about Seong Jun.

216
00:16:11,445 --> 00:16:14,445
He's extremely clever and resourceful.

217
00:16:14,445 --> 00:16:18,356
Is this your wedding gift for Seong Jun?

218
00:16:18,356 --> 00:16:20,956
Well, he's only starting out,

219
00:16:20,956 --> 00:16:23,626
so you should train him well.

220
00:16:24,596 --> 00:16:26,396
   

221
00:16:26,396 --> 00:16:32,125
Did you think I wouldn't know about this when you knew about it too?

222
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,095
You knew?

223
00:16:34,905 --> 00:16:37,036
What? The land-banking for the New Seoul Town project.

224
00:16:37,036 --> 00:16:40,975
You knew that it was all Seong Jun, not Hyung Young Ki?

225
00:16:45,615 --> 00:16:47,745
My grandson, Seong Jun.

226
00:16:47,745 --> 00:16:50,516
I was right there the moment he was born

227
00:16:50,516 --> 00:16:53,415
instead of his father, who was in jail at the time.

228
00:16:53,415 --> 00:16:59,086
He is my eldest grandson, the one and only.

229
00:17:41,036 --> 00:17:42,665
Okay. Everyone is ready, right?

230
00:17:42,665 --> 00:17:44,306
All right, here we go.

231
00:17:44,306 --> 00:17:46,206
One, two...

232
00:17:46,206 --> 00:17:48,075
Hey, Do Jun!

233
00:17:59,016 --> 00:18:01,155
I'm sorry I'm late.

234
00:18:01,155 --> 00:18:03,185
- All right. 
 - Hey, come here.

235
00:18:04,456 --> 00:18:07,066
Okay, here we go.

236
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:09,066
Smile, everyone.

237
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:13,666
Well, since we were interrupted anyway... Mr. Mayor, do you mind switching?

238
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,806
- With her? 
 - No, with Mr. Jin.

239
00:18:16,806 --> 00:18:18,306
- Smile. 
 - You two can switch.

240
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,976
- You can stay where you are. 
 - No, why should he...

241
00:18:19,976 --> 00:18:24,376
Why? Do you have nothing to smile about these days?

242
00:18:24,376 --> 00:18:25,976
Mr. Jin Dong Ki, please take your hands out of your pockets.

243
00:18:25,976 --> 00:18:28,486
- Yes, thank you. 
 - Grandfather, you were right.

244
00:18:28,486 --> 00:18:30,646
- Oh, Hyeong Jun. 
 - I was foolish.

245
00:18:30,646 --> 00:18:32,556
All right. Give me a bigger smile.

246
00:18:32,556 --> 00:18:35,026
I've given up on my goal of buying Soonyang with my money.

247
00:18:35,026 --> 00:18:37,625
All right, here we go. Smile, please!

248
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:38,956
We'll take it now.

249
00:18:38,956 --> 00:18:42,296
One, two, three.

250
00:18:50,106 --> 00:18:53,276
My gosh, thank you all for coming.

251
00:18:53,276 --> 00:18:55,306
- Congratulations, Sir. 
 - Congratulations.

252
00:18:55,306 --> 00:18:57,745
- Oh, my. You made it, too. 
 - Congratulations, Sir.

253
00:18:57,745 --> 00:18:59,415
- Congratulations, Sir. 
 - Congratulations, Sir.

254
00:18:59,415 --> 00:19:01,346
- Sir. 
 - Yes?

255
00:19:04,556 --> 00:19:06,516
That little...

256
00:19:16,966 --> 00:19:21,165
I tried to keep my cool but couldn't. I was so fuming mad

257
00:19:21,165 --> 00:19:24,435
that I ran here as soon as they removed the IV from my arm.

258
00:19:24,435 --> 00:19:28,475
I wanted to take it up with you in person.

259
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:32,276
What's going on? What happened?

260
00:19:32,976 --> 00:19:34,616
Look.

261
00:19:36,345 --> 00:19:39,686
Don't you have enough to worry about with your foolish sons?

262
00:19:40,256 --> 00:19:42,256
Your grandson.

263
00:19:42,855 --> 00:19:46,055
You need to teach him better!

264
00:19:57,066 --> 00:19:58,705
You may leave.

265
00:20:03,405 --> 00:20:05,615
Congratulations on your wedding.

266
00:20:06,976 --> 00:20:09,386
As for DMC, I'm sorry.

267
00:20:09,386 --> 00:20:12,285
How did you think of going up against Soonyang?

268
00:20:12,285 --> 00:20:15,685
You're smart. Why did you make such a mistake?

269
00:20:15,685 --> 00:20:19,625
Grandfather may think it's his youngest grandson's prank,

270
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,625
but I'm different.

271
00:20:23,835 --> 00:20:26,796
"Don't start a fight that already has an ending."

272
00:20:27,665 --> 00:20:30,165
That's what you said.

273
00:20:32,675 --> 00:20:35,706
It doesn't look like a fight that already has an ending.

274
00:20:45,756 --> 00:20:47,255
Yes.

275
00:20:53,595 --> 00:20:55,465
Is this true?

276
00:20:57,335 --> 00:21:00,366
Have the spots at DMC been filled?

277
00:21:01,506 --> 00:21:03,236
Is it true?

278
00:21:04,335 --> 00:21:06,835
That's why I was late for your wedding.

279
00:21:06,835 --> 00:21:09,675
The deadline set out by Seoul City was today,

280
00:21:09,675 --> 00:21:12,145
so I had to wrap up everything for the agreement.

281
00:21:13,145 --> 00:21:18,185
Oh, right. I will not hand over the DMC project to Soonyang Group.

282
00:21:21,885 --> 00:21:24,926
What on earth did you do?

283
00:21:27,566 --> 00:21:29,325
Are you implying

284
00:21:30,566 --> 00:21:33,266
that there is no sensible, legal way

285
00:21:33,266 --> 00:21:36,435
for me to find companies that would support the DMC project

286
00:21:36,435 --> 00:21:40,275
because of Soonyang's meddling cowardly antics?

287
00:21:42,476 --> 00:21:44,606
Is that what you meant, Hyungnim Seong Jun?

288
00:21:57,296 --> 00:21:59,495
Tell me.

289
00:21:59,495 --> 00:22:01,925
How can Daeyoung beat Soonyang

290
00:22:01,925 --> 00:22:06,196
and become number one again in the distribution industry?

291
00:22:06,196 --> 00:22:08,235
Is there a way?

292
00:22:10,536 --> 00:22:15,306
I heard you decided to sell Daeyoung Distribution.

293
00:22:15,306 --> 00:22:17,645
Now is not the time to sell it.

294
00:22:18,615 --> 00:22:20,516
You should acquire another company.

295
00:22:20,516 --> 00:22:21,615
What did you say?

296
00:22:21,615 --> 00:22:24,356
A home shopping channel is up for sale.

297
00:22:24,356 --> 00:22:26,216
You should acquire "Buy and Sell Home Shopping."

298
00:22:26,216 --> 00:22:29,425
Look, SNU Law student.

299
00:22:29,425 --> 00:22:32,196
Don't you know the government's policy after the IMF financial crisis?

300
00:22:32,196 --> 00:22:34,196
Such an aggressive expansion strategy through acquisitions

301
00:22:34,196 --> 00:22:35,625
is a relic of a bygone era.

302
00:22:36,796 --> 00:22:38,296
Daeyoung has no interest

303
00:22:38,296 --> 00:22:41,665
in showbiz, where clowns are busy goofing around.

304
00:22:41,665 --> 00:22:44,066
It's not showbiz, Sir.

305
00:22:45,236 --> 00:22:46,975
It's distribution

306
00:22:46,975 --> 00:22:49,175
and logistics.

307
00:22:49,175 --> 00:22:51,405
Daeyoung's specialty.

308
00:23:00,486 --> 00:23:02,756
 It's a mink coat with a classic, timeless design, 

309
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,796
 offered to you at an affordable price point. 

310
00:23:04,796 --> 00:23:05,895
 At a glance, you can tell... 

311
00:23:05,895 --> 00:23:09,925
People no longer buy what they need. They buy what they want.

312
00:23:09,925 --> 00:23:12,196
Thanks to the home shopping channels that stimulate

313
00:23:12,196 --> 00:23:14,436
the impulse purchase instinct 24-7.

314
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:16,835
In the comfort of their own home,

315
00:23:16,835 --> 00:23:17,905
with a single click of a button.

316
00:23:17,905 --> 00:23:19,135
 That's a given. 

317
00:23:19,135 --> 00:23:22,506
 As you can see here, the luxurious sheen... 

318
00:23:22,506 --> 00:23:25,746
And all home shopping channels

319
00:23:25,746 --> 00:23:27,716
need a distribution company to move goods.

320
00:23:27,716 --> 00:23:29,946
If Daeyoung has a distribution company in one hand,

321
00:23:29,946 --> 00:23:32,016
and a home shopping channel in the other hand...

322
00:23:32,016 --> 00:23:34,986
It'd be like killing two birds with one stone,

323
00:23:34,986 --> 00:23:38,855
killing two flies with one slap,

324
00:23:38,855 --> 00:23:42,696
and mashing two potatoes with one fork.

325
00:23:43,365 --> 00:23:45,065
Am I right?

326
00:23:47,706 --> 00:23:51,806
I suggest you acquire a home shopping channel, Sir.

327
00:23:52,976 --> 00:23:55,145
Then Daeyoung will soon be

328
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:59,775
the number one distribution company again.

329
00:24:02,246 --> 00:24:05,216
He was very persuasive, so what could I do?

330
00:24:05,216 --> 00:24:07,385
I had no choice but to give in.

331
00:24:07,385 --> 00:24:11,296
Daeyoung is going into DMC.

332
00:24:11,296 --> 00:24:14,225
Sit back and wait.

333
00:24:14,225 --> 00:24:17,925
We'll retrieve the number one title in distribution in no time.

334
00:24:22,736 --> 00:24:24,935
I can't see you out.

335
00:24:25,806 --> 00:24:28,336
Take care of your health.

336
00:24:30,046 --> 00:24:32,216
How petty.

337
00:24:32,216 --> 00:24:35,715
Is this how you treat your guests?

338
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,996
As you ordered, I prepared a share transfer agreement

339
00:24:53,996 --> 00:24:56,566
for Mr. Jin Seong Jun.

340
00:25:01,175 --> 00:25:03,246
Sir!

341
00:25:03,246 --> 00:25:06,776
It's okay. Hold on.

342
00:25:06,776 --> 00:25:08,546
   

343
00:25:13,615 --> 00:25:16,085
   

344
00:25:16,085 --> 00:25:18,095
 Symptoms include 

345
00:25:18,095 --> 00:25:19,425
 sudden headaches 

346
00:25:19,425 --> 00:25:23,696
 and temporary mobility impairments. 

347
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:27,365
   

348
00:25:43,385 --> 00:25:45,216
Mr. Lee.

349
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,986
Yes, Sir.

350
00:25:46,986 --> 00:25:49,156
About Medical Director Jung...

351
00:25:49,156 --> 00:25:53,455
Let's make sure he'll keep his lips sealed.

352
00:25:55,365 --> 00:25:56,895
Gosh.

353
00:25:58,696 --> 00:26:00,635
Oh, dear.

354
00:26:01,706 --> 00:26:05,776
My children can't find out about this yet.

355
00:26:06,575 --> 00:26:08,976
Oh, I'm okay now.

356
00:26:21,085 --> 00:26:22,726
On behalf of the ten million citizens of Seoul,

357
00:26:22,726 --> 00:26:24,696
I'd like to propose a toast.

358
00:26:24,696 --> 00:26:27,966
Here's to their forever love. Cheers!

359
00:26:27,966 --> 00:26:30,325
 Cheers! 

360
00:26:31,165 --> 00:26:32,595
- Congratulations. 
 - Congratulations, Seong Jun.

361
00:26:32,595 --> 00:26:33,996
- Congratulations. 
 - Congratulations.

362
00:26:33,996 --> 00:26:36,766
- My gosh. 
 - Congratulations, son.

363
00:26:43,075 --> 00:26:44,876
It's sweet.

364
00:26:51,386 --> 00:26:54,016
I guess I'm finally growing up

365
00:26:54,016 --> 00:26:56,556
now that my son is married.

366
00:26:58,455 --> 00:27:01,665
Father. Thanks to all your help and support,

367
00:27:01,665 --> 00:27:05,896
I managed to raise Seong Jun well,

368
00:27:05,896 --> 00:27:08,206
who has now found his better half.

369
00:27:08,206 --> 00:27:10,435
Thank you, Father.

370
00:27:12,675 --> 00:27:15,645
Please say a few words.

371
00:27:15,645 --> 00:27:20,445
Seong Jun and his wife will always remember and heed your advice.

372
00:27:20,445 --> 00:27:24,616
I'm sure they'll live a happy life together and won't let you down.

373
00:27:24,616 --> 00:27:26,415
He's asking for the wedding gift, isn't he?

374
00:27:26,415 --> 00:27:27,926
He is wrapping it up with a fanfare.

375
00:27:27,926 --> 00:27:29,786
The reception is over.

376
00:27:29,786 --> 00:27:32,625
The coronation ceremony has begun.

377
00:27:39,896 --> 00:27:41,705
My advice?

378
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:48,276
Who wants to listen to this old man nag?

379
00:27:50,476 --> 00:27:54,276
You're all curious about my wedding gift for Seong Jun.

380
00:27:57,815 --> 00:28:00,416
Doesn't anyone here not know

381
00:28:01,786 --> 00:28:04,756
how precious Seong Jun is to me?

382
00:28:09,425 --> 00:28:11,966
My gift is

383
00:28:13,395 --> 00:28:16,006
something Seong Jun had asked for.

384
00:28:16,006 --> 00:28:17,905
Oh, my.

385
00:28:21,175 --> 00:28:23,775
- Manager Lee. 
 - Yes, Sir.

386
00:28:34,855 --> 00:28:36,925
Thank you.

387
00:28:52,505 --> 00:28:54,905
   

388
00:29:04,216 --> 00:29:08,215
You asked me to let you take responsibility as a real adult.

389
00:29:17,165 --> 00:29:19,796
Starting Monday, Seong Jun

390
00:29:20,766 --> 00:29:24,136
will work at Geochang Distribution Warehouse.

391
00:29:33,645 --> 00:29:35,685
- Father. 
 - The notice states that he's now

392
00:29:35,685 --> 00:29:38,215
in charge of the warehouse.

393
00:29:38,215 --> 00:29:41,255
The illegal land-banking of the New Seoul Town.

394
00:29:42,026 --> 00:29:45,425
And we failed to land the construction of DMC.

395
00:29:51,335 --> 00:29:54,236
You should take responsibility, don't you think?

396
00:29:59,476 --> 00:30:01,905
That is what a real adult ought to do.

397
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:07,616
Father, but how could you...

398
00:30:10,885 --> 00:30:13,215
As for his shares in the company,

399
00:30:13,215 --> 00:30:15,786
we can revisit the issue another time,

400
00:30:15,786 --> 00:30:18,056
but you want him to work at a distribution warehouse?

401
00:30:18,056 --> 00:30:20,226
As of today,

402
00:30:22,026 --> 00:30:24,396
Soonyang

403
00:30:26,766 --> 00:30:31,036
will no longer follow the rule of primogeniture.

404
00:30:45,986 --> 00:30:49,526
Either buy all the shares with your money

405
00:30:50,486 --> 00:30:53,296
or prove your competence and abilities as a leader.

406
00:30:53,296 --> 00:30:55,526
Suit yourselves.

407
00:30:57,296 --> 00:31:00,935
The one who can make Soonyang bigger and better than I can

408
00:31:00,935 --> 00:31:03,405
will get everything,

409
00:31:05,135 --> 00:31:07,375
including my shares

410
00:31:08,105 --> 00:31:10,345
and the right to run the business.

411
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:17,216
Father.

412
00:31:17,216 --> 00:31:20,885
How could you do this to me? How?

413
00:31:20,885 --> 00:31:23,526
After everything I've done for you and Soonyang...

414
00:31:23,526 --> 00:31:26,196
Young Ki, about your knee...

415
00:31:27,496 --> 00:31:29,265
Director Jung at the medical center said

416
00:31:29,265 --> 00:31:31,835
that the medicines these days worked very well.

417
00:31:31,835 --> 00:31:35,196
Fixing it will be no problem at all.

418
00:31:35,206 --> 00:31:39,375
Just don't miss your doctor's appointments.

419
00:31:42,446 --> 00:31:44,645
If you don't take care of yourself,

420
00:31:44,645 --> 00:31:46,375
- who will? 
 - Father!

421
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:49,516
Don't you know whom I love the most

422
00:31:49,516 --> 00:31:51,716
out of all my children?

423
00:31:57,925 --> 00:32:00,125
It's Soonyang.

424
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:17,806
Oppa Dong Ki, do you know anything about this?

425
00:32:17,806 --> 00:32:20,676
Hey! Jin Hwa Young, you little...

426
00:32:20,676 --> 00:32:23,185
What are you saying? What would I know?

427
00:32:23,185 --> 00:32:27,315
You know, at the wedding, Oppa Dong Ki and Father talked for a while.

428
00:32:27,315 --> 00:32:29,825
- Hey! 
 - Am I wrong?

429
00:32:29,825 --> 00:32:33,126
- Dong Ki, you little... 
 - I don't know anything!

430
00:32:33,126 --> 00:32:36,395
Well, if what Father said is true,

431
00:32:36,395 --> 00:32:38,696
Seong Jun himself must know the reason the best.

432
00:32:38,696 --> 00:32:41,196
Hey. Am I wrong, Seong Jun?

433
00:32:43,535 --> 00:32:45,606
That brat...

434
00:33:21,775 --> 00:33:23,506
- Hey! 
 - Hyeon Min!

435
00:33:23,506 --> 00:33:25,345
- My gosh! 
 - Hyeon Min! Oh, dear.

436
00:33:25,345 --> 00:33:27,645
Hey! What's wrong with her?

437
00:33:27,645 --> 00:33:29,546
Wake up, Hyeon Min. Open your eyes!

438
00:33:29,546 --> 00:33:31,455
My goodness. Why did she faint suddenly?

439
00:33:31,455 --> 00:33:33,986
- Honey! 
 - Seong Jun! Call an ambulance!

440
00:33:33,986 --> 00:33:36,225
- Wake up! 
 - Why did she pass out suddenly?

441
00:33:36,225 --> 00:33:38,755
- Hyeon Min, wake up! 
 - Hello? We need an ambulance.

442
00:33:47,366 --> 00:33:50,535
 How did you teach your grandson? 

443
00:33:50,535 --> 00:33:56,076
 How dare he come at me like that without even batting an eye? 

444
00:33:56,076 --> 00:34:00,245
 He has quite a nerve, that kid. 

445
00:34:01,245 --> 00:34:06,455
 But he sure knows how to catch the whiff of money, 

446
00:34:06,455 --> 00:34:08,055
 just like you. 

447
00:34:08,055 --> 00:34:11,986
 He reminds me of the Jin Yang Cheol I met at the repair shop in Incheon 50 years ago. 

448
00:34:11,986 --> 00:34:14,155
 He takes after you. 

449
00:34:14,155 --> 00:34:18,925
 I had let my guard down because none of your sons takes after you. 

450
00:34:18,925 --> 00:34:22,166
 But your grandson got me good. 

451
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:25,066
 He sure made me flinch. 

452
00:34:35,245 --> 00:34:37,485
 I was foolish. 

453
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:43,256
 I've given up on my goal of buying Soonyang with my money. 

454
00:34:44,895 --> 00:34:50,195
 Instead, I'll use what I learned from you. 

455
00:34:50,195 --> 00:34:52,466
 Okay. Everyone's ready, right? 

456
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:54,736
 Here we go. We'll take it now. 

457
00:34:54,736 --> 00:34:57,535
 I am your grandson. But even against me, 

458
00:34:57,535 --> 00:35:01,776
 you wielded all the authority and power Soonyang had. 

459
00:35:01,776 --> 00:35:05,846
 I will also utilize every possible means and methods in my power 

460
00:35:06,546 --> 00:35:08,015
 and plan to buy Soonyang. 

461
00:35:08,015 --> 00:35:11,085
 All right. Let's do this, for one last time. 

462
00:35:11,085 --> 00:35:12,886
 - Smile, please! 
 - Smile, Grandfather. 

463
00:35:12,886 --> 00:35:14,085
 We'll take it now. 

464
00:35:14,085 --> 00:35:17,955
 One, two, three. 

465
00:35:24,835 --> 00:35:26,566
Mr. Lee.

466
00:35:27,395 --> 00:35:29,566
Do you think so, too?

467
00:35:29,566 --> 00:35:31,065
Pardon?

468
00:35:32,136 --> 00:35:36,446
That Do Jun takes after me.

469
00:35:36,446 --> 00:35:38,975
Do you think that makes sense?

470
00:35:50,585 --> 00:35:54,756
It went as you planned, Fellow Korean Lad.

471
00:35:56,165 --> 00:35:57,565
Congratulations.

472
00:35:57,565 --> 00:36:01,335
At last, you, the youngest grandson

473
00:36:01,335 --> 00:36:04,435
have a shot at inheriting Soonyang.

474
00:36:06,775 --> 00:36:11,476
I didn't break the rule of primogeniture because I needed a shot.

475
00:36:12,076 --> 00:36:16,046
I'm still intent on buying Soonyang.

476
00:36:17,116 --> 00:36:20,755
I know better than anyone else

477
00:36:20,755 --> 00:36:22,986
just how much

478
00:36:23,656 --> 00:36:28,955
my dear Soonyang family loves and cherishes each other.

479
00:36:28,955 --> 00:36:30,566
What?

480
00:36:33,136 --> 00:36:37,506
They'll show faces unlike any they showed before.

481
00:36:38,235 --> 00:36:43,906
Now everyone has a shot at becoming the next owner of Soonyang.

482
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:50,375
That's too much money to stay loyal to each other.

483
00:37:14,535 --> 00:37:16,676
It's late.

484
00:37:18,076 --> 00:37:21,276
Stop protesting and go to bed.

485
00:37:21,276 --> 00:37:23,745
Good for you.

486
00:37:25,515 --> 00:37:29,256
You can tell I'm protesting?

487
00:37:34,025 --> 00:37:40,596
Did you have to go and do that on his wedding day of all days?

488
00:37:41,366 --> 00:37:45,975
How shocked must the new bride have been to...

489
00:37:47,636 --> 00:37:50,576
If he did something wrong, you could talk to him nicely

490
00:37:50,576 --> 00:37:53,715
and teach him what he should do.

491
00:37:53,715 --> 00:37:57,785
You have a way of hurting the kids.

492
00:37:59,656 --> 00:38:03,756
Does coddling them make them better people?

493
00:38:03,756 --> 00:38:07,995
His dad is incapable of teaching his son when the boy goes off course.

494
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:09,525
His uncle is terrified

495
00:38:09,525 --> 00:38:13,696
he'll lose what's his to his nephew and is wary about everything.

496
00:38:13,696 --> 00:38:16,105
And our daughter

497
00:38:16,105 --> 00:38:20,336
thinks less of her father than a stick with poop on the end.

498
00:38:21,205 --> 00:38:23,045
Out of the kids you bore,

499
00:38:23,045 --> 00:38:27,145
none of them have their heads screwed on straight.

500
00:38:33,116 --> 00:38:38,556
Then what about Yoon Ki?

501
00:38:39,796 --> 00:38:42,126
Do you think I don't know?

502
00:38:42,126 --> 00:38:45,466
Why do you neglect Yoon Ki's family?

503
00:38:45,466 --> 00:38:48,196
You gave him the foundation that makes nothing.

504
00:38:48,196 --> 00:38:50,866
What do you think people will say of me?

505
00:38:50,866 --> 00:38:54,236
They'll say that I discriminate the kid that isn't mine.

506
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,906
That nonsense again.

507
00:39:00,275 --> 00:39:03,746
Didn't you hear what I said earlier?

508
00:39:03,746 --> 00:39:06,285
The one who makes Soonyang bigger,

509
00:39:06,285 --> 00:39:12,286
whomever that may be, gets to keep it all.

510
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:17,665
Remember this one thing.

511
00:39:18,835 --> 00:39:21,435
Yoon Ki.

512
00:39:21,435 --> 00:39:25,636
I fed and clothed him the exact same as I did our Young Ki and Dong Ki.

513
00:39:25,636 --> 00:39:29,035
I stayed up at night, worried for them equally.

514
00:39:30,005 --> 00:39:33,776
It wasn't because I pitied him for not having a mother.

515
00:39:35,946 --> 00:39:39,186
It was so as not to ruin your reputation.

516
00:39:41,756 --> 00:39:47,055
I need you to remember that one thing.

517
00:39:53,196 --> 00:39:54,935
   

518
00:40:03,775 --> 00:40:07,576
Medical director Jung says it's not serious.

519
00:40:07,576 --> 00:40:10,115
Don't worry too much.

520
00:40:10,115 --> 00:40:10,986
Okay.

521
00:40:10,986 --> 00:40:14,955
You talk to her parents so they don't worry.

522
00:40:14,955 --> 00:40:20,526
I should ask her mother if she's weak or sick.

523
00:40:20,526 --> 00:40:22,895
I know she had a scare,

524
00:40:22,895 --> 00:40:26,996
but what woman makes her husband stay up to nurse her on their wedding night?

525
00:40:26,996 --> 00:40:29,536
He already has a lot on his plate.

526
00:40:30,406 --> 00:40:32,535
You should go home and rest.

527
00:40:32,535 --> 00:40:33,505
Okay.

528
00:40:33,505 --> 00:40:35,806
I put you through a lot today.

529
00:40:35,806 --> 00:40:38,006
We can talk about us later.

530
00:40:38,006 --> 00:40:40,315
- Okay. 
 - Bye.

531
00:41:07,105 --> 00:41:09,876
Tell your mother.

532
00:41:11,176 --> 00:41:15,916
I'm not the weak one. Her son is.

533
00:41:15,916 --> 00:41:17,715
What are you doing?

534
00:41:17,715 --> 00:41:19,916
That's what I want to say.

535
00:41:19,916 --> 00:41:21,955
What were you going to do?

536
00:41:21,955 --> 00:41:25,395
Were you going to run up and throw a punch?

537
00:41:25,395 --> 00:41:27,995
Why? To take it out on Jin Do Jun?

538
00:41:27,995 --> 00:41:31,026
Were you worried he'd get punched?

539
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:34,090
Get a hold of yourself.

540
00:41:35,136 --> 00:41:39,966
The rest of your family is just waiting for you to mess up.

541
00:41:39,966 --> 00:41:42,205
They're always preparing to drag you down.

542
00:41:42,205 --> 00:41:44,246
Will you feed yourself to them so easily?

543
00:41:44,246 --> 00:41:46,746
I can't accept that.

544
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:49,286
Remember.

545
00:41:49,286 --> 00:41:54,516
You're only allowed to show your back in front of me.

546
00:41:55,185 --> 00:41:58,256
Because we at least are a team.

547
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:06,196
Can you handle it if I show my back?

548
00:42:07,165 --> 00:42:08,765
I warned you that

549
00:42:08,765 --> 00:42:12,206
it's bad for you to overestimate yourself.

550
00:42:12,206 --> 00:42:15,906
If you look down on someone, you end up paying dearly.

551
00:42:22,285 --> 00:42:25,116
This is the only time I'll let you off for hitting me.

552
00:42:25,756 --> 00:42:27,585
It's our wedding night,

553
00:42:27,585 --> 00:42:30,626
so I'll remember it as our burning physical act.

554
00:42:41,806 --> 00:42:44,310
Can I go?

555
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:45,805
It's my wedding night.

556
00:42:45,805 --> 00:42:49,275
I'd like to sleep in a room that smells like nice makeup,

557
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:51,275
like a human.

558
00:43:11,365 --> 00:43:13,895
   

559
00:43:16,665 --> 00:43:18,406
As per the chairman's wishes,

560
00:43:18,406 --> 00:43:23,176
we must reorganize the subsidiaries you own between you.

561
00:43:23,906 --> 00:43:27,046
First, Vice-Chairman Jin Young Ki.

562
00:43:27,046 --> 00:43:28,915
You'll remain Vice-Chairman

563
00:43:28,915 --> 00:43:31,716
of Soonyang Corporation and Electronics, but on top of that,

564
00:43:31,716 --> 00:43:34,915
you now have the same authority to make decisions as the chairman.

565
00:43:34,915 --> 00:43:36,886
Why?

566
00:43:36,886 --> 00:43:42,296
So he can hold me responsible and exile me too if business profits go down?

567
00:43:46,866 --> 00:43:48,896
Executive Director Jin Dong Ki.

568
00:43:48,896 --> 00:43:51,805
You'll serve as vice-chairman of the whole group

569
00:43:51,805 --> 00:43:53,605
and manage Heavy Machinery, Chemicals,

570
00:43:53,605 --> 00:43:57,176
the stock firm, and Soonyang's asset management.

571
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,046
If he's vice-chairman,

572
00:43:59,046 --> 00:44:01,886
does that make him Oppa Young Ki's equal?

573
00:44:01,886 --> 00:44:04,046
Why would you say we're equals?

574
00:44:04,046 --> 00:44:06,486
So what if I'm in charge of a whole lot?

575
00:44:06,486 --> 00:44:09,015
None of them are worth anything.

576
00:44:09,015 --> 00:44:11,355
Heavy Machinery and Chemicals put together

577
00:44:11,355 --> 00:44:14,255
make less than 60 percent of what Electronics does.

578
00:44:14,255 --> 00:44:16,025
Soonyang Department Store

579
00:44:16,025 --> 00:44:18,395
will merge with the hotel and supermarket chains.

580
00:44:18,395 --> 00:44:21,595
The new Soonyang Distribution Group will be a separate entity.

581
00:44:21,595 --> 00:44:25,205
The necessary procedures will be taken care of soon.

582
00:44:25,205 --> 00:44:26,935
What does that mean?

583
00:44:26,935 --> 00:44:28,906
He's giving me a separate group

584
00:44:28,906 --> 00:44:31,506
because I'm married and no longer part of this family?

585
00:44:31,506 --> 00:44:33,475
It's not just a small group.

586
00:44:33,475 --> 00:44:36,245
The hotel chain includes the condos...

587
00:44:36,245 --> 00:44:38,915
Wait, the golf courses, too?

588
00:44:38,915 --> 00:44:42,225
You're taking the main pillar of the business.

589
00:44:42,225 --> 00:44:45,926
You still get to live in the main house, Vice-President.

590
00:44:50,165 --> 00:44:51,895
The separation is a demand

591
00:44:51,895 --> 00:44:54,495
made by the government and IMF.

592
00:44:54,495 --> 00:44:56,906
The future of Soonyang Distribution depends on whether

593
00:44:56,906 --> 00:45:00,006
the supermarket chain goes nationwide.

594
00:45:00,006 --> 00:45:01,905
Chairman Jin

595
00:45:02,605 --> 00:45:06,005
has given you a chance to show what you can do.

596
00:45:08,546 --> 00:45:10,945
To separate the subsidiaries,

597
00:45:10,945 --> 00:45:13,956
it's imperative to sort out the shares and debt obligations

598
00:45:13,956 --> 00:45:16,986
between the main group and Soonyang Distribution.

599
00:45:19,495 --> 00:45:21,026
That is the amount of debt

600
00:45:21,026 --> 00:45:25,196
you must repay your brothers' subsidiaries.

601
00:45:25,196 --> 00:45:27,696
This much?

602
00:45:37,245 --> 00:45:38,915
So you had a hard time?

603
00:45:38,915 --> 00:45:40,116
I did.

604
00:45:40,116 --> 00:45:41,915
If you need that much money,

605
00:45:41,915 --> 00:45:46,085
you should talk to CEO Oh Se Hyeon of Miracle Investment.

606
00:45:46,085 --> 00:45:52,285
It's a company that has the most cash flow in Korea now.

607
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:56,165
- Put me down. 
 - Oh, dear...

608
00:45:56,165 --> 00:45:58,166
Do you want me to ask Do Jun for help?

609
00:45:58,166 --> 00:45:59,335
What?

610
00:45:59,335 --> 00:46:00,665
Stop it.

611
00:46:00,665 --> 00:46:03,506
Why do you think Dad threw that bombshell at the wedding?

612
00:46:03,506 --> 00:46:05,066
What?

613
00:46:06,136 --> 00:46:08,946
He'd always been displeased with the eldest brother.

614
00:46:08,946 --> 00:46:13,176
And there's no way Oppa Dong Ki or I suddenly impressed him.

615
00:46:13,176 --> 00:46:16,515
The only change is Do Jun's existence.

616
00:46:16,515 --> 00:46:19,446
Jin Do Jun, Miracle's majority shareholder.

617
00:46:19,446 --> 00:46:23,156
Do you still think I should go to him for money?

618
00:46:23,156 --> 00:46:25,225
Well...

619
00:46:25,225 --> 00:46:27,290
Oh, dear...

620
00:46:29,496 --> 00:46:31,666
   

621
00:46:31,666 --> 00:46:32,966
Have some tea.

622
00:46:32,966 --> 00:46:34,495
   

623
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:36,105
   

624
00:46:40,136 --> 00:46:42,376
What is it now?

625
00:46:45,176 --> 00:46:48,145
Don't you think you should get the department store

626
00:46:48,145 --> 00:46:51,685
to do something special for Lee Hae In?

627
00:47:05,635 --> 00:47:07,166
   

628
00:47:07,166 --> 00:47:09,600
   

629
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,765
He looks like his mom.

630
00:47:13,576 --> 00:47:15,575
Wait, what's this?

631
00:47:15,575 --> 00:47:17,476
What is this?

632
00:47:18,375 --> 00:47:20,816
Who says money can't buy youth?

633
00:47:20,816 --> 00:47:23,716
How is she my mom's age? She's prettier than I am.

634
00:47:23,716 --> 00:47:25,785
Life is so unfair.

635
00:47:25,785 --> 00:47:26,886
Look at Jin Do Jun.

636
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:29,486
He doesn't have to study for the bar as we do.

637
00:47:29,486 --> 00:47:31,756
He can just inherit a subsidiary,

638
00:47:31,756 --> 00:47:33,495
marry some girl from a rich family,

639
00:47:33,495 --> 00:47:35,625
and live happily in luxury for generations.

640
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:37,026
That doesn't suit him.

641
00:47:37,026 --> 00:47:40,736
A face like that goes with a fateful relationship with a huge star.

642
00:47:40,736 --> 00:47:44,905
The most pointless thing is to worry about celebrities and rich people.

643
00:47:44,905 --> 00:47:48,435
Are you two that sure you'll pass the second exam?

644
00:47:48,435 --> 00:47:52,505
We might care what Jin Do Jun does,

645
00:47:52,505 --> 00:47:54,716
but I bet he doesn't care about us.

646
00:47:54,716 --> 00:47:57,716
Can you not mind him at all now?

647
00:47:57,716 --> 00:48:00,156
It makes you guys look really bored.

648
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:07,360
Was mentioning Jin Do Jun something to get told off for?

649
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:13,540
   

650
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:17,360
   

651
00:48:17,366 --> 00:48:19,466
Please come this way.

652
00:48:28,616 --> 00:48:30,846
   

653
00:48:47,636 --> 00:48:50,236
Please wait here.

654
00:48:54,406 --> 00:48:55,930
Do Jun.

655
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:57,800
Mother.

656
00:48:58,846 --> 00:49:01,216
Are you here to see your aunt?

657
00:49:01,216 --> 00:49:03,916
Yes. You, too?

658
00:49:03,916 --> 00:49:05,546
Yes.

659
00:49:15,395 --> 00:49:18,625
Don't I look strange?

660
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:19,636
What?

661
00:49:19,636 --> 00:49:24,136
Does it show that I tried hard to look young?

662
00:49:28,636 --> 00:49:32,176
No. You look so pretty.

663
00:49:34,176 --> 00:49:36,985
Trust Aunt Hwa Young's eye.

664
00:49:36,985 --> 00:49:40,485
She asked you to work in fashion at the department store.

665
00:49:40,485 --> 00:49:44,725
She doesn't ask just anyone.

666
00:49:44,725 --> 00:49:47,396
- That is true, isn't it? 
 - Yes.

667
00:49:50,125 --> 00:49:55,266
Mother. Both Hyung Hyeong Jun and I are adults now.

668
00:49:55,266 --> 00:49:59,666
If there's anything you want to do, you should do it now.

669
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:02,506
You even have a trusted investor.

670
00:50:03,305 --> 00:50:04,845
Right here.

671
00:50:05,875 --> 00:50:07,875
Your dad

672
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:12,645
became an outcast because he married me.

673
00:50:13,785 --> 00:50:15,785
Now, at last,

674
00:50:15,785 --> 00:50:20,456
I think they're accepting us as a member of the family.

675
00:50:20,456 --> 00:50:22,855
That's how I feel.

676
00:50:24,426 --> 00:50:27,535
At least this time,

677
00:50:27,535 --> 00:50:32,036
I won't get in your way.

678
00:50:40,645 --> 00:50:42,816
Will you please wait here for a while?

679
00:50:42,816 --> 00:50:44,845
Ms. Jin will be here soon.

680
00:50:44,845 --> 00:50:47,386
Ms. Lee, please come with me.

681
00:50:48,155 --> 00:50:49,180
See you.

682
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:51,050
Go ahead.

683
00:50:57,766 --> 00:51:01,535
We'll show the 1999 SS collection to

684
00:51:01,535 --> 00:51:05,866
celebs of the fashion world and VIP customers.

685
00:51:05,866 --> 00:51:09,135
What is it that I should be doing?

686
00:51:10,605 --> 00:51:14,145
   

687
00:51:22,826 --> 00:51:25,426
She's here.

688
00:51:30,466 --> 00:51:35,966
I like this color less than the one that came out in the previous season.

689
00:51:48,216 --> 00:51:51,685
Last season's item would suit your skin tone better.

690
00:51:51,685 --> 00:51:54,185
- Yes. 
 - But you already bought that.

691
00:51:54,185 --> 00:51:55,955
How about the skirt?

692
00:51:55,955 --> 00:51:58,656
I'm not sure. Can I see how it looks at the back?

693
00:51:58,656 --> 00:52:00,325
Sure.

694
00:52:38,165 --> 00:52:39,335
- Well?
- I like it.

695
00:52:39,335 --> 00:52:41,135
Okay.

696
00:52:41,135 --> 00:52:43,896
Go ahead.

697
00:52:43,896 --> 00:52:45,906
You have a great eye.

698
00:52:46,736 --> 00:52:50,276
You really do. I'm envious.

699
00:52:52,676 --> 00:52:54,145
No one can beat time.

700
00:52:54,145 --> 00:52:55,846
Lee Hae In is no longer a star.

701
00:52:55,846 --> 00:52:58,716
She profited enough by marrying into the Jin family.

702
00:52:58,716 --> 00:53:02,355
I heard she was treated like a princess.

703
00:53:02,355 --> 00:53:04,386
She's from a different background.

704
00:53:04,386 --> 00:53:06,586
That's true.

705
00:53:06,586 --> 00:53:08,725
Come on.

706
00:53:18,735 --> 00:53:21,406
So? Did you enjoy the show?

707
00:53:27,415 --> 00:53:31,516
If you have anything to say, please tell me directly, Aunt.

708
00:53:31,516 --> 00:53:34,215
Do not step over the line!

709
00:53:34,215 --> 00:53:37,026
Know your place.

710
00:53:39,656 --> 00:53:41,396
Like this?

711
00:53:47,736 --> 00:53:53,866
Why do you think we accepted your father, born out of wedlock?

712
00:53:53,866 --> 00:53:59,045
And why did we accept your mom without saying anything, who was the talk of the world?

713
00:54:00,475 --> 00:54:02,576
For a single reason.

714
00:54:04,145 --> 00:54:09,456
It was to display the noblesse oblige of Soonyang to the world.

715
00:54:17,026 --> 00:54:21,966
A kind of a showcase.

716
00:54:25,435 --> 00:54:31,435
Don't you dare delude yourself into thinking that you can be a rightful heir.

717
00:54:32,875 --> 00:54:34,775
You guys

718
00:54:36,346 --> 00:54:41,486
are different from us.

719
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:47,656
I shouldn't be saying this only to you.

720
00:54:47,656 --> 00:54:49,526
That's how people work.

721
00:54:49,526 --> 00:54:52,326
You have to learn by experience not to forget.

722
00:54:54,196 --> 00:55:00,035
Since you're a smart kid, I hope these words were enough.

723
00:55:36,245 --> 00:55:39,605
   

724
00:55:44,086 --> 00:55:47,570
   

725
00:55:55,555 --> 00:55:57,926
   

726
00:55:59,166 --> 00:56:02,696
   

727
00:56:02,696 --> 00:56:06,235
   

728
00:56:06,235 --> 00:56:07,036
   

729
00:56:07,036 --> 00:56:11,145
A department store. A resort. Golf. Hotel.

730
00:56:11,145 --> 00:56:12,375
   

731
00:56:12,375 --> 00:56:14,416
It's all consumer industry.

732
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:18,685
I'm sure they took a big blow after the IMF crisis and suffered from a huge deficit.

733
00:56:18,685 --> 00:56:23,355
But he took everything here and gave it to his only daughter?

734
00:56:24,426 --> 00:56:28,896
The chairman is showing tough love for his girl.

735
00:56:29,566 --> 00:56:33,195
I picked out a company Miracle should invest in.

736
00:56:33,195 --> 00:56:37,366
It's the hottest IT venture company now.

737
00:56:37,366 --> 00:56:39,435
New Data Technology.

738
00:56:39,435 --> 00:56:41,875
It's about to get listed on KOSDAQ at the end of the month.

739
00:56:41,875 --> 00:56:45,246
There's a huge attention over the electronic communication field.

740
00:56:45,246 --> 00:56:48,676
Some even presume them to go up by four times the offering price.

741
00:56:48,676 --> 00:56:51,045
What's their business that makes them so hot?

742
00:56:51,045 --> 00:56:53,586
Free internet calls.

743
00:56:53,586 --> 00:56:55,216
You knew, Howard?

744
00:56:55,216 --> 00:56:56,485
   

745
00:56:56,485 --> 00:56:58,455
 It's an unforgettable name. 

746
00:56:58,455 --> 00:57:00,155
 New Data Technology. 

747
00:57:00,155 --> 00:57:04,326
 New Data Technology successfully launched their online call service. 

748
00:57:04,326 --> 00:57:06,736
 Young Jun, bump up the AC! 

749
00:57:06,736 --> 00:57:07,935
 Did you buy it? 

750
00:57:07,935 --> 00:57:11,766
 Everyone has bought those New Data Technology stocks. 

751
00:57:11,766 --> 00:57:13,875
 Hit a new maximum price just ten more times. 

752
00:57:13,875 --> 00:57:15,435
 Then I'll quit working right away. 

753
00:57:15,435 --> 00:57:16,375
 Is it that good? 

754
00:57:16,375 --> 00:57:18,676
 Mr. Kim bought a car after he invested in that. 

755
00:57:18,676 --> 00:57:20,846
 - A car? 
 - Yes! 

756
00:57:20,846 --> 00:57:22,216
 - Really? 
 - His new car? 

757
00:57:22,216 --> 00:57:25,545
 It began at 1500 won ($1.50), then got up to 300k won ($300) dollars in six months. 

758
00:57:25,545 --> 00:57:28,955
 It skyrocketed 200 times. 

759
00:57:28,955 --> 00:57:32,225
 But it dropped by 98 percent of the highest price in just a year. 

760
00:57:32,225 --> 00:57:34,355
 Another bearish factor hits the market. 

761
00:57:34,355 --> 00:57:36,096
 The price plummeted down to 5500 won ($5) 

762
00:57:36,096 --> 00:57:38,725
 after hitting a record of 300 dollars. 

763
00:57:38,725 --> 00:57:41,066
 It was the most beloved item that faced the most wretched ending 

764
00:57:41,066 --> 00:57:44,105
 in the history of the stock market. 

765
00:57:44,105 --> 00:57:50,136
 A legendary symbol of the dot-com bubble era is none other than New Data Technology. 

766
00:57:51,576 --> 00:57:54,616
Wait, do you already have an investment plan?

767
00:57:54,616 --> 00:57:56,976
I doubt it.

768
00:57:56,976 --> 00:58:02,515
Mr. Majority Shareholder here thinks the dot-com fad is a speculative bubble.

769
00:58:02,515 --> 00:58:05,855
Miracle won't invest in it, Rachael.

770
00:58:05,855 --> 00:58:06,827
No.

771
00:58:06,827 --> 00:58:08,995
You clearly told me last time that you won't invest in IT...

772
00:58:08,995 --> 00:58:12,596
I clearly said I will invest when the flower wilts and it comes to fruition.

773
00:58:12,596 --> 00:58:15,236
- When is that? 
 - Now.

774
00:58:15,236 --> 00:58:17,136
   

775
00:58:17,136 --> 00:58:19,135
Let's join the wagon.

776
00:58:19,135 --> 00:58:21,676
New Data Technology.

777
00:58:38,585 --> 00:58:41,326
Let me report back on 4-2.

778
00:58:41,326 --> 00:58:44,696
It looks like he has taken interest in stock trading.

779
00:58:44,696 --> 00:58:46,665
He's often visiting stock firms,

780
00:58:46,665 --> 00:58:48,335
and I could tell through his phone calls

781
00:58:48,335 --> 00:58:52,206
that he invested a huge amount in a venture business.

782
00:58:52,206 --> 00:58:56,235
Yes, what was the name again?

783
00:58:56,235 --> 00:58:59,245
New Data Technology?

784
00:59:00,076 --> 00:59:03,246
It's a newly listed IT venture company.

785
00:59:03,246 --> 00:59:09,356
They began at 1500 won, and stock firms presume it'll reach up to 40k won.

786
00:59:09,356 --> 00:59:12,556
Wait, then 300M won  ($300,000)  will give me 10B won  ($10M) ?

787
00:59:13,625 --> 00:59:15,396
Are you sure about this?

788
00:59:16,625 --> 00:59:18,825
How is their business?

789
00:59:18,825 --> 00:59:24,296
IT businesses are the growth driver of the current government.

790
00:59:24,296 --> 00:59:29,065
Where do you think the money they put out before the general election will go?

791
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:35,106
Above all, the research team of Soonyang Investment is the top of the industry, Vice-Chairman Jin.

792
00:59:36,585 --> 00:59:41,185
Where does Do Jun get all this information?

793
00:59:42,555 --> 00:59:47,195
That young kid is the owner of Miracle Investment?

794
00:59:48,125 --> 00:59:54,196
Did Father break the rule of primogeniture... because of him?

795
00:59:56,035 --> 00:59:58,105
Is the guy that I planted next to Do Jun doing well?

796
00:59:58,105 --> 01:00:00,335
He's been doing well since he returned from his break.

797
01:00:00,335 --> 01:00:02,806
Do Jun is not suspicious of him, either

798
01:00:02,806 --> 01:00:04,976
Call the Business Department of the investment firm.

799
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:09,176
Tell them to do everything to buy the stocks of New Data Technology.

800
01:00:11,185 --> 01:00:15,415
So? How much do we need right now, Ms. Im?

801
01:00:15,415 --> 01:00:17,926
A total of 400B Won  ($400M) .

802
01:00:20,395 --> 01:00:24,026
It costs 120B won  ($120M)  to make a nationwide chain network for Soonyang Mart.

803
01:00:24,026 --> 01:00:27,825
Also, we have to pay back Soonyang Electronics and Soonyang Heavy Machinery

804
01:00:27,825 --> 01:00:31,636
for share acquisition, 150B  ($150M)  and 130B  ($130M) , respectively.

805
01:00:31,636 --> 01:00:34,705
How much more can we borrow from the bank?

806
01:00:34,705 --> 01:00:38,545
We've already taken out loans to our limit from our primary bank.

807
01:00:38,545 --> 01:00:40,446
I see. That leaves me no choice.

808
01:00:40,446 --> 01:00:42,846
I need to look into funds from Myeong-dong.

809
01:00:42,846 --> 01:00:47,416
The private loan industry agreed not to put any cash into the market.

810
01:00:47,416 --> 01:00:51,026
The interest rate for banks is speculated to go up to 25 percent.

811
01:00:51,026 --> 01:00:55,255
So they'll hold it back until that moment comes...

812
01:00:55,255 --> 01:00:56,996
What's the alternative?

813
01:00:56,996 --> 01:00:58,396
I'm sorry.

814
01:00:58,396 --> 01:01:02,965
Is all you can say as the director of finances that you're sorry?

815
01:01:03,636 --> 01:01:05,365
You may leave.

816
01:01:07,676 --> 01:01:13,106
Director, about the payables for Soonyang Electronics and Soonyang Heavy Machinery.

817
01:01:13,106 --> 01:01:14,846
If they would postpone the time limit of payment

818
01:01:14,846 --> 01:01:19,485
or reduce the interest rate, it'll help us hold out.

819
01:01:24,285 --> 01:01:25,785
Sure, I'll do that for you.

820
01:01:25,785 --> 01:01:27,496
   

821
01:01:27,496 --> 01:01:31,196
Of course, my only baby sister is in trouble.

822
01:01:31,196 --> 01:01:32,765
   

823
01:01:32,765 --> 01:01:38,536
Right, CEO Jin. Are you aware of this?

824
01:01:38,536 --> 01:01:41,506
If the stock transactions are incomplete between affiliations,

825
01:01:41,506 --> 01:01:43,776
the separation process will also be delayed.

826
01:01:43,776 --> 01:01:48,076
Is it okay for Father to find out?

827
01:01:48,076 --> 01:01:52,315
What if he makes a scene saying you are incompetent...

828
01:01:52,315 --> 01:01:55,486
Hello? Hello...

829
01:01:55,486 --> 01:01:58,025
Father was harsh on you.

830
01:01:58,025 --> 01:02:01,896
How can golf clubs and hotels do well in this terrible economy?

831
01:02:01,896 --> 01:02:07,825
People show tough love for those they love the most, but it's for those who can take it.

832
01:02:07,825 --> 01:02:09,805
Just wrap it up and come back to the group.

833
01:02:09,805 --> 01:02:12,135
I'll have a chat with Father.

834
01:02:12,135 --> 01:02:14,006
   

835
01:02:18,475 --> 01:02:19,716
 If you need that much money, 

836
01:02:19,716 --> 01:02:23,015
 you should talk to CEO Oh Se Hyeon of Miracle Investment. 

837
01:02:23,015 --> 01:02:24,116
 I told you, didn't I? 

838
01:02:24,116 --> 01:02:28,816
 It's the company that has the most cash flow in Korea now. 

839
01:02:34,155 --> 01:02:35,655
No, no, no.

840
01:02:35,655 --> 01:02:38,496
   

841
01:02:39,265 --> 01:02:44,305
 Chairman Jin has given you a chance to show what you can do. 

842
01:03:00,386 --> 01:03:04,285
I'm here sitting with you, CEO Oh.

843
01:03:04,285 --> 01:03:06,225
But people are so weird.

844
01:03:06,225 --> 01:03:11,295
They all say the true owner of Miracle is our own Do Jun.

845
01:03:11,295 --> 01:03:15,665
We did begin with his pocket money of 24B won  ($24M)  from Chairman Jin.

846
01:03:15,665 --> 01:03:17,665
What do you think, CEO Oh?

847
01:03:17,665 --> 01:03:22,006
Does he have a knack for investing unlike his young age?

848
01:03:23,346 --> 01:03:26,505
I didn't know you were here for a parent-teacher meeting.

849
01:03:27,745 --> 01:03:29,246
Doesn't it feel unfair?

850
01:03:29,246 --> 01:03:31,386
You brought up Miracle to this day with your own power,

851
01:03:31,386 --> 01:03:34,455
but it has degenerated into a rich kid's trophy.

852
01:03:34,455 --> 01:03:37,156
Everything in this world comes with a price tag.

853
01:03:37,156 --> 01:03:41,356
There is no noble value that cannot be converted into money.

854
01:03:41,356 --> 01:03:45,396
People who dare to say love is an invaluable thing

855
01:03:45,396 --> 01:03:49,295
are people who are like thieves that love free things.

856
01:03:49,295 --> 01:03:53,505
If you cannot buy happiness with money, then it's because you don't have enough.

857
01:03:53,505 --> 01:03:56,876
- So? 
 - If you need Miracle,

858
01:03:56,876 --> 01:03:59,446
then you can pay the price.

859
01:03:59,446 --> 01:04:01,375
As long as I'm the CEO of Miracle,

860
01:04:01,375 --> 01:04:06,115
we won't cause any influence over the succession of Soonyang.

861
01:04:06,115 --> 01:04:09,316
I'm saying you don't have to mind Do Jun.

862
01:04:10,026 --> 01:04:12,785
I'm with a partner who speaks my language.

863
01:04:15,696 --> 01:04:18,625
I need 400B won  ($400M) . As soon as possible.

864
01:04:18,625 --> 01:04:23,066
Our partnership also comes with a price, CEO Jin.

865
01:04:23,066 --> 01:04:27,066
Give us 30 percent of Soonyang Department Store's stocks as the collateral.

866
01:04:29,105 --> 01:04:31,676
Thirty percent of my shares?

867
01:04:33,245 --> 01:04:36,516
Are you saying the department store is only worth that little?

868
01:04:36,516 --> 01:04:41,446
I'm taking them only as collateral until you pay everything you owe us.

869
01:04:41,446 --> 01:04:45,085
The consumer sentiment will get back on track by the end of the year.

870
01:04:45,085 --> 01:04:49,225
I'm sure you'll work even harder for the collateral's sake.

871
01:04:53,336 --> 01:04:55,596
   

872
01:04:57,405 --> 01:04:59,866
   

873
01:04:59,866 --> 01:05:01,176
Right.

874
01:05:01,176 --> 01:05:04,975
You wanted to know if Do Jun had the knack for investing.

875
01:05:04,975 --> 01:05:05,946
Yes.

876
01:05:05,946 --> 01:05:08,546
I put on a huge fight this time.

877
01:05:08,546 --> 01:05:12,116
He insisted that he wouldn't invest in IT companies.

878
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:15,456
You know, right? New Data Technology.

879
01:05:15,456 --> 01:05:17,156
New Data?

880
01:05:17,156 --> 01:05:19,786
You don't know?

881
01:05:19,786 --> 01:05:23,855
This is the new idol of the KOSDAQ that hit many new record prices as soon as it was listed.

882
01:05:23,855 --> 01:05:25,426
I see.

883
01:05:25,426 --> 01:05:29,435
It began at 1500 won  ($1.50) , then reached 10,000 won  ($10)  in a week,

884
01:05:29,435 --> 01:05:32,565
so that's seven times.

885
01:05:33,335 --> 01:05:38,006
It'll surely rise up to at least 40,000 won  ($40) .

886
01:05:39,176 --> 01:05:40,776
Forty...

887
01:05:40,776 --> 01:05:44,616
I would've been in big trouble if I had listened to him.

888
01:05:44,616 --> 01:05:46,745
- Excuse me. 
 - Wait.

889
01:05:46,745 --> 01:05:49,415
It already jumped up seven times, yet it can reach 40,000 won  ($40) ?

890
01:05:49,415 --> 01:05:51,555
How is that possible?

891
01:05:53,026 --> 01:05:58,856
It's a shame that Do Jun couldn't see that, but he's still young.

892
01:05:59,665 --> 01:06:01,636
Is that a good enough answer?

893
01:06:01,636 --> 01:06:03,596
Sure.

894
01:06:03,596 --> 01:06:05,166
Excuse me.

895
01:06:18,185 --> 01:06:19,685
What?

896
01:06:20,585 --> 01:06:23,015
Hwa Young paid back what she owes you, too?

897
01:06:23,015 --> 01:06:26,756
She must have paid back what she owes the Electronics, too.

898
01:06:26,756 --> 01:06:32,925
Man, that means we cannot revert the separation of Hwa Young's affiliations.

899
01:06:34,995 --> 01:06:39,305
Our father's only daughter sure is driven!

900
01:06:39,305 --> 01:06:44,806
Where did she suddenly find such a huge amount of money?

901
01:06:44,806 --> 01:06:47,375
Could it be Father?

902
01:06:50,816 --> 01:06:52,915
Miracle?

903
01:06:54,355 --> 01:06:58,756
So the 400 billion won  ($400M)  came out of Do Jun's pocket?

904
01:07:01,725 --> 01:07:06,696
They must have requested collateral for that huge amount.

905
01:07:06,696 --> 01:07:09,666
If she put out a percentage of her Department store shares,

906
01:07:09,666 --> 01:07:13,705
her managerial rights may fall in danger now that her group is separated.

907
01:07:13,705 --> 01:07:18,805
She went on her independent way with over 8,000 employees to look after.

908
01:07:18,805 --> 01:07:21,946
I'm sure she has a plan.

909
01:07:25,545 --> 01:07:27,486
The department store, the hotel, and the golf club.

910
01:07:27,486 --> 01:07:30,155
Find all the cash we can in the Distribution Group.

911
01:07:30,155 --> 01:07:34,256
I'm going to invest in New Data Technology.

912
01:07:34,256 --> 01:07:36,396
CEO Jin, that sounds a little dangerous.

913
01:07:36,396 --> 01:07:39,965
You heard the Research Team of Soonyang Investment, too.

914
01:07:39,965 --> 01:07:42,936
They said it'll go up to 40,000 won  ($40)  within one month.

915
01:07:42,936 --> 01:07:45,535
It'll rise by fourfold!

916
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:48,475
Also, the Business Department of Soonyang Investment

917
01:07:48,475 --> 01:07:50,876
who has the highest earnings in the industry

918
01:07:50,876 --> 01:07:54,616
has been purchasing the shares of New Data Technology.

919
01:07:54,616 --> 01:07:56,845
While Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki, that man who knows these things,

920
01:07:56,845 --> 01:08:01,745
is earning fourfold, fivefold of profit, should I sit around doing nothing but suck my fingers?

921
01:08:01,745 --> 01:08:03,326
But CEO Jin,

922
01:08:03,326 --> 01:08:07,356
you cannot make private use of the department store's fund...

923
01:08:07,356 --> 01:08:09,026
I'm not keeping this for myself.

924
01:08:09,026 --> 01:08:14,096
I'll return the principal and the profit back to the department store in just a month.

925
01:08:14,096 --> 01:08:16,395
Don't worry about it.

926
01:08:16,395 --> 01:08:22,736
Make sure to find 3 billion won  ($3M)  at all costs and invest it into New Data Technology.

927
01:08:25,405 --> 01:08:28,780
   

928
01:08:33,385 --> 01:08:37,186
CEO Oh, it's me, Jin Hwa Young.

929
01:08:37,186 --> 01:08:39,485
Did you bring some, too?

930
01:08:39,485 --> 01:08:41,956
Did you put in three billion won  ($3M) ?

931
01:08:43,366 --> 01:08:47,736
CEO Jin, listen up.

932
01:08:47,736 --> 01:08:53,505
Once the stocks go up to 40,000 won  ($40)  in a month, you have to sell them without looking back.

933
01:08:53,505 --> 01:08:57,475
There is a false report going around among people in finance saying

934
01:08:57,475 --> 01:09:01,405
it'll go up to 100k won  ($100)  and 200k won  ($200) , but do not linger around.

935
01:09:01,405 --> 01:09:03,916
You must focus on managing the department store.

936
01:09:03,916 --> 01:09:06,246
I am sharing this with you not as a creditor...

937
01:09:06,246 --> 01:09:07,755
A partner.

938
01:09:07,755 --> 01:09:10,755
but as a partner.

939
01:09:11,755 --> 01:09:15,496
How long will this rally of new top price continue?

940
01:09:16,996 --> 01:09:19,366
Up to about 300k won  ($300) .

941
01:09:19,366 --> 01:09:22,195
Come on, not 30, but 300 dollars?

942
01:09:22,195 --> 01:09:25,466
Says whom? Was this in a finance report?

943
01:09:25,466 --> 01:09:26,736
CEO Oh did.

944
01:09:26,736 --> 01:09:28,776
- Me? 
 - Mason?

945
01:09:28,776 --> 01:09:32,575
If what's moving the stock price isn't their technology or business,

946
01:09:32,575 --> 01:09:35,215
then the answer to this soaring price is evident.

947
01:09:35,215 --> 01:09:36,885
Hosts of manipulators.

948
01:09:36,885 --> 01:09:38,785
Yes.

949
01:09:38,785 --> 01:09:42,655
They'll need the money by the nomination of next year's general election.

950
01:09:42,655 --> 01:09:47,225
If the level of increase remains the same, then it'll go up to 300,000 won  ($300) .

951
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:48,656
But why 40,000 won  ($40) ?

952
01:09:48,656 --> 01:09:52,565
Why did you tell her to pull out at 40 dollars?

953
01:09:52,565 --> 01:09:56,196
She put in 3 billion won  ($3M) , so she'll make 12 billion won  ($12M) .

954
01:09:56,196 --> 01:09:58,166
Exactly four times.

955
01:09:58,166 --> 01:10:00,135
That's good enough.

956
01:10:00,135 --> 01:10:05,136
It'll make her happy for making money and feel confident about investing.

957
01:10:10,345 --> 01:10:13,585
Miracle Investment, Rachel speaking.

958
01:10:13,585 --> 01:10:15,085
It's Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki.

959
01:10:15,085 --> 01:10:16,855
One second.

960
01:10:16,855 --> 01:10:19,456
It's the secretary of Vice-Chairman Jin Young Ki.

961
01:10:19,456 --> 01:10:21,755
He's looking for you, CEO Oh.

962
01:10:25,265 --> 01:10:30,596
I called you out today to be a good brother.

963
01:10:32,765 --> 01:10:34,675
Hwa Young, no.

964
01:10:34,675 --> 01:10:37,845
CEO Jin Hwa Young borrowed money from you, right?

965
01:10:37,845 --> 01:10:39,675
I'll pay that back.

966
01:10:39,675 --> 01:10:41,175
In return,

967
01:10:41,175 --> 01:10:47,245
you can give me the shares of Soonyang Department Store you got as collateral.

968
01:10:47,245 --> 01:10:51,886
I'm guessing you weren't happy that the department store separated from Soonyang Group.

969
01:10:51,886 --> 01:10:55,795
The IMF doesn't know what the situation in Korea is like.

970
01:10:56,795 --> 01:11:01,795
But at this point in time, large corporations must stick together to survive.

971
01:11:01,795 --> 01:11:05,566
We must push and pull each other forward.

972
01:11:05,566 --> 01:11:07,876
I'm sure you've heard the term Korean democratization.

973
01:11:07,876 --> 01:11:09,036
It's the same thing.

974
01:11:09,036 --> 01:11:13,005
Korea needs a Korean way of economic democratization.

975
01:11:13,005 --> 01:11:15,416
Giving work to specific places. Corrupt ties with politics.

976
01:11:15,416 --> 01:11:17,015
Reckless business diversification. Illegal managerial succession.

977
01:11:17,015 --> 01:11:19,145
Things like these?

978
01:11:19,145 --> 01:11:21,485
You do not want the separation of the affiliation

979
01:11:21,485 --> 01:11:26,886
because you're afraid you won't inherit as much.

980
01:11:26,886 --> 01:11:29,196
Hand over her collateral to me.

981
01:11:29,196 --> 01:11:31,626
I demand 800 billion won  ($800M) .

982
01:11:34,436 --> 01:11:36,666
You're going to get twice as much from this?

983
01:11:36,666 --> 01:11:41,306
This is 30 percent of the shares of your sister's department store.

984
01:11:41,306 --> 01:11:46,806
I'll need at least twice as much to betray my partner.

985
01:11:53,416 --> 01:11:55,286
I'll give you twice as much.

986
01:11:55,286 --> 01:11:58,686
Give me the shares for the department store.

987
01:11:58,686 --> 01:12:02,055
I believe Chairman Jin Yang Cheol wanted this separation.

988
01:12:02,055 --> 01:12:06,795
Do you think he'll be happy if the collateral ends up in your hands?

989
01:12:08,135 --> 01:12:11,105
I'm doing everything for my father's sake.

990
01:12:11,105 --> 01:12:15,336
She is my sister, but CEO Jin Hwa Young may be able to run the department store,

991
01:12:15,336 --> 01:12:17,746
but she's not competent enough to run the Distribution Group.

992
01:12:17,746 --> 01:12:21,545
If I walked in her shoes, I would have cashed out the affiliations that don't bring in money.

993
01:12:21,545 --> 01:12:23,876
Well, anyway.

994
01:12:24,986 --> 01:12:28,986
This is the only way to keep the department store together.

995
01:12:30,285 --> 01:12:33,685
Give me the collateral, CEO Oh.

996
01:12:36,126 --> 01:12:39,965
I'll think about it if you give me four times.

997
01:12:49,406 --> 01:12:52,406
Are you saying you aren't looking to sell those?

998
01:12:52,406 --> 01:12:56,516
I see. You weren't after the money to begin with.

999
01:12:56,516 --> 01:12:58,845
You wanted the managerial rights of the department store, CEO Oh...

1000
01:12:58,845 --> 01:13:03,355
No, it's not you.

1001
01:13:03,355 --> 01:13:04,585
Is it Do Jun?

1002
01:13:04,585 --> 01:13:07,626
 Onroad, the top internet company of Korea 

1003
01:13:07,626 --> 01:13:10,965
 just announced a technical tie-up with New Data Technology. 

1004
01:13:10,965 --> 01:13:12,095
 When the announcement was made, 

1005
01:13:12,095 --> 01:13:17,635
 New Data Technology's stock price skyrocketed and ended the day at 5500 won  ($55) . 

1006
01:13:17,635 --> 01:13:22,465
 The stock market says if this level of increase continues, 

1007
01:13:22,465 --> 01:13:24,946
 they will become the first company in the history of KOSDAQ 

1008
01:13:24,946 --> 01:13:28,176
 to reach 100k won  ($100)  within the month. 

1009
01:13:28,176 --> 01:13:33,086
The price went over 40k won  ($40) . It's skyrocketing.

1010
01:13:33,956 --> 01:13:36,816
I'm starting to wonder.

1011
01:13:36,816 --> 01:13:39,956
Will she feel satisfied after getting what she wanted?

1012
01:13:39,956 --> 01:13:47,255
Or will she feel at a loss for losing something she could have had?

1013
01:13:48,865 --> 01:13:51,505
I wonder which is more significant.

1014
01:13:51,505 --> 01:13:52,667
   

1015
01:13:52,667 --> 01:13:57,250
Do you know how much I lost after selling this at 40k won  ($40) ?

1016
01:13:58,535 --> 01:14:03,745
In just a few hours, I lost 4.5 billion won  ($4.5M) .

1017
01:14:03,745 --> 01:14:05,080
I lost 4.5 billion won  ($4.5M) !

1018
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:06,840
   

1019
01:14:06,845 --> 01:14:11,485
 The rationality of the human mind always tells us to focus on the satisfaction we have. 

1020
01:14:12,326 --> 01:14:17,086
 But desire always stand on the side of the things we could have had. 

1021
01:14:17,086 --> 01:14:21,526
 New Data Technology continues to hit a new high for 55 days in a row. 

1022
01:14:21,526 --> 01:14:24,365
Look at that. Drop.

1023
01:14:25,105 --> 01:14:28,766
We'll conduct an on-site audit for the new four branches.

1024
01:14:28,766 --> 01:14:31,576
How does next week sound, CEO Jin?

1025
01:14:31,576 --> 01:14:33,506
Drop.

1026
01:14:33,506 --> 01:14:35,316
Excuse me.

1027
01:14:35,316 --> 01:14:36,876
CEO Jin?

1028
01:14:36,876 --> 01:14:39,886
- CEO Jin? 
 - CEO Jin?

1029
01:15:03,536 --> 01:15:08,576
Aunt, CEO Oh told me that you invested in New Data Technology.

1030
01:15:08,576 --> 01:15:10,346
Is he really an expert investor?

1031
01:15:10,346 --> 01:15:13,786
Do you know how much I lost after I listened to that man's advice?

1032
01:15:13,786 --> 01:15:17,786
I see. What a relief. I was worried.

1033
01:15:19,925 --> 01:15:23,825
There are hosts of manipulators behind New Data Technology.

1034
01:15:23,825 --> 01:15:26,595
- Manipulators? 
 - Yes.

1035
01:15:26,595 --> 01:15:29,936
I hear they'll take the flight up to 300k won  ($300) .

1036
01:15:29,936 --> 01:15:33,736
But who knows when this defective aircraft will take the plunge?

1037
01:15:33,736 --> 01:15:36,875
But I guess it's high risk, high return.

1038
01:15:36,875 --> 01:15:39,505
So it will go up further?

1039
01:15:39,505 --> 01:15:42,976
This isn't the time for you to make such aggressive investment.

1040
01:15:42,976 --> 01:15:45,286
What do you mean?

1041
01:15:55,655 --> 01:15:59,065
Two uncles each came to see CEO Oh.

1042
01:15:59,065 --> 01:16:01,795
I guess they were worried about the collateral.

1043
01:16:01,795 --> 01:16:06,706
They wanted to buy the department store's shares.

1044
01:16:07,805 --> 01:16:09,705
And?

1045
01:16:09,705 --> 01:16:12,675
Are you saying he handed it over?

1046
01:16:12,675 --> 01:16:15,145
Of course not, Aunt.

1047
01:16:15,145 --> 01:16:17,446
We're family.

1048
01:16:18,845 --> 01:16:22,256
But CEO Oh is different. You know that, right?

1049
01:16:22,256 --> 01:16:26,655
He's willing to do anything if you can pay the price.

1050
01:16:26,655 --> 01:16:28,755
Do not lay your hand on the department store's shares.

1051
01:16:28,755 --> 01:16:33,126
I don't care who touches it, but I will never forgive them.

1052
01:16:35,295 --> 01:16:37,205
Don't stand around like a creditor. Go.

1053
01:16:37,205 --> 01:16:40,406
That darned money? I'll pay it back.

1054
01:16:40,406 --> 01:16:41,776
   

1055
01:16:41,776 --> 01:16:43,736
Good grief.

1056
01:16:47,515 --> 01:16:49,576
I knew it, Aunt.

1057
01:16:51,015 --> 01:16:54,185
You surely are different from us.

1058
01:17:08,965 --> 01:17:11,395
Tell Director Im to come in right now.

1059
01:17:15,975 --> 01:17:22,475
 When desire is defeated, it turns into rage and pulls the bowstring tightly. 

1060
01:17:37,196 --> 01:17:40,426
What's the settlement cost for next month from the businesses in the department store?

1061
01:17:40,426 --> 01:17:42,965
- 140 billion won  ($140M), Ma'am. 
 - Make them into postdated checks. 

1062
01:17:42,965 --> 01:17:46,005
- Sorry? 
 - I'm going to invest

1063
01:17:46,005 --> 01:17:50,035
those 140 billion won  ($140M)  into New Data Technology.

1064
01:17:50,035 --> 01:17:51,345
CEO Jin, that's the department store's...

1065
01:17:51,345 --> 01:17:53,305
I am Soonyang Department Store,

1066
01:17:53,305 --> 01:17:56,175
and Soonyang Department Store is me!

1067
01:17:58,986 --> 01:18:04,486
Invest all 140 billion won  ($140M) .

1068
01:18:09,956 --> 01:18:16,296
 When the arrow leaves the bow, it flies over to the target without hesitation. 

1069
01:18:18,036 --> 01:18:19,805
 And that target is 

1070
01:18:24,175 --> 01:18:26,345
 always one's own self. 

1071
01:18:29,445 --> 01:18:34,600
 Reborn Rich 

1072
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:43,030


1073
01:19:03,846 --> 01:19:07,545
 CEO Jin, you have made enough. You should stop investing in stocks... 

1074
01:19:07,545 --> 01:19:10,055
 They said it'll go up to 300k won  ($300) . 

1075
01:19:10,055 --> 01:19:12,086
 There will be a photoshoot. 

1076
01:19:12,086 --> 01:19:13,855
 The theme is a female prosecutor. 

1077
01:19:13,855 --> 01:19:16,425
 I'm Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong. Who's calling? 

1078
01:19:16,425 --> 01:19:19,825
 You want me to investigate CEO Jin Hwa Young's embezzlement? 

1079
01:19:19,825 --> 01:19:23,265
 So we're here today as a prosecutor and an informant. 

1080
01:19:23,265 --> 01:19:26,265
 Why not? Am I not allowed to? 

1081
01:19:26,265 --> 01:19:28,475
 Jin Do Jun, that jerk! 

1082
01:19:28,475 --> 01:19:30,376
 Pull yourself together, Jin Hwa Young! 

1083
01:19:30,376 --> 01:19:32,845
 How is Do Jun at fault? 

1084
01:19:32,845 --> 01:19:34,015
 Father. 

1085
01:19:34,015 --> 01:19:35,146
 I must hold a board meeting. 

1086
01:19:35,146 --> 01:19:38,716
 Today's agenda is the dismissal of CEO Jin Hwa Young. 

1087
01:19:38,716 --> 01:19:43,160
 The prosecutor in charge of Aunt Hwa Young's case is Do Jun's college classmate. 

1088
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:46,650
♫   Please miss me sometimes  &nbsp;♫

1089
01:19:46,650 --> 01:19:49,780
♫    so that the memory of us loving can remain.  &nbsp;♫
