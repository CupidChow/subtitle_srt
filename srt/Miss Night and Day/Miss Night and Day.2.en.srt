Auntie!

8
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:30,697
That's the cutest kitten I've ever seen.

9
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,658
You're cuter.

10
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,826
The kitten is cute too.

11
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,370
Yeah. It's beautiful, right?

12
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:43,669
What?

13
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:11,780
Goodness.

14
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,465
The light…

15
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,511
What?

16
00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:46,933
It's Auntie.

MISSING PERSON

18
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,069
Please calm down and return home.

19
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:53,363
But my sister, Lim Sun,

20
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,115
isn't the type to leave home.

21
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:59,119
She didn't run away.
She's definitely missing!

22
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,789
I told you several times an adult
can't be reported missing right away.

23
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,791
- But--
- You said you got a text too.

24
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:08,044
That's why it's driving me crazy!

25
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,297
How much longer do I have to wait?

26
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,090
Can you look for her? Please!

27
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:14,342
Okay, I will. I'll look for her.

Shouldn't we cancel it now?

30
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,641
What are you saying? Don't be absurd.

31
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,101
She'll be back.

32
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,312
I know she'll come back.

33
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,648
I'll find her. I'm going to find her.

34
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,568

37
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,056
Bye, Mom and Dad.

38
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:03,642
Why leave so early?

39
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:04,809
It's my first day.

40
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,561
- Eat before you go.
- No, I'm fine.

41
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:08,814
You can't work on an empty stomach.

42
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,565
Come on.

43
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:11,483
Here.

44
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,734
Mom!

45
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,778
I'll have to brush my teeth again.
It's fine.

46
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:19,991
Mom, I'm late.

47
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,370
It's finally our daughter's
first day of work.

48
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,747
Sorry, Dad!

49
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,760
I know it's her first day,
but to push her own dad?

50
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,887
She's a civil servant now.

51
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,889
The first day is so important.

52
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:45,433
Why were you in her way like that?

53
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:46,810
Eat this.

54
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,563
It is her first day.

SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

56
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:23,513
These are the interns who will start
working at our office today.

57
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:24,472
Seo Mal-tae.

58
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,558
Mr. Seo, I've heard about you.

59
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,268
You used to be a detective?

60
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,061
Yes, I have decades of experience.

61
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:33,148
I'll try my best to be meticulous here.

62
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,151
I hear you are the oldest
among our selected applicants.

63
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,444
Mr. Geum Gwang-seok.

64
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,321
You hired me even though I'm lacking.

65
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,865
I'm very honored.

66
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,199
Chief!

67
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,328
No, I'm not the chief.
I'm just the deputy chief.

68
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:47,829
Ms. Na Ok-hui.

69
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,916
Ms. Na, you're quite beautiful.

70
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,543
I bet you made
plenty of men cry in your day.

71
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,755
- Sir.
- Yes?

72
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:00,216
That could be considered
sexual harassment.

73
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,011
You're educated.
Don't you know the times we live in?

74
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,012
Thank you.

75
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,096
Mr. Ko Na-heun.

76
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,181
Right.

77
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,518
I heard you're a former soldier, Mr. Ko.

78
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:13,855
I ended up like this
after answering the call for my country.

79
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:15,190
Goodness.

80
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,071
- I'm so sorry.
- Why didn't you bring a chair?

81
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,114
I'm sorry.

82
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,282
- Ms. Lim Sun.
- Sorry.

83
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,535
The famous young applicant!

84
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,746
You had the highest marks
in the interview.

85
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,082
- Really? I did?
- Of course.

86
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,086
I've never been the best
in anything before.

87
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,796
Thank you.

88
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,882
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

89
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,801
SECURITY PASS

90
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,261
Let's take one more
with your badge showing.

91
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,971
One, two…

92
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,934
So,

93
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,562
you want us to clean
the entire main building?

94
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:58,525
Yes, the prosecutor in Room 307
is being transferred here today,

95
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,068
so make sure it's especially clean.

96
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,946
Right. Clean.

97
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,966

99
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,696
<i>What's he doing here?</i>

100
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,005
What are you doing in my office?

101
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:46,257
I'm sorry. I was cleaning.

102
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,720
<i>He's like a different person
with glasses on.</i>

103
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,931
But what are you doing here?

104
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:54,599
This is my office.

105
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:55,683
No way.

106
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,186
This is the new prosecutor's office.

107
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,312
PROSECUTOR GYE JI-UNG

108
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,191
<i>He's a prosecutor?</i>

109
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:04,901
<i>Of all places, here?</i>

110
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,694
<i>Really?</i>

111
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,321
Just clean it quick and go.

112
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:11,241
<i>Wow, he's colder than before.</i>

113
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,325
Yes, sir.

114
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:21,960
Allow me.

115
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,670
<i>What's this?</i>

116
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,630
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,674
I'll buy a similar one to replace this.

118
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,926
No, I had no intention of maintaining it.

119
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,010
What?

120
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,701
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT

121
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,920
Is he really the same person I met before?

122
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,797
Why is he so cold?

123
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,259
Why did he have to be a prosecutor?

124
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,761
And why did he have to work where I work?

125
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:14,888
Also,

126
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,849
why is his office on the third floor
where I'm cleaning?

127
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,392
- What?
- What the hell?

128
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:21,978
I'm sorry.

129
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,857
I didn't take you
for being so foul-mouthed.

130
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,859
You must've been wild in your youth.

131
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,361
What do you mean?
I was totally popular and dank.

132
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,030
What? "Dank"?

133
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,489
Is that a swear?

134
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,993
You can't say such harsh things
to someone who's old!

135
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,621
Son of a bitch.

136
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:42,790
Damn it.

137
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,087
<i>What the hell?</i>

138
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,425
You start tomorrow, so why come in?

139
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,843
I can't just let…

140
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,262
a great day like this go by.

141
00:09:56,346 --> 00:10:01,142
Seoul Central District's ace prosecutor
was suddenly sent to the boondocks.

142
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,270
You didn't follow me here, did you?

143
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,189
<i>After enduring a year under you,</i>

144
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,900
everyone asked if I owed you something.

145
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:13,071
Or did I have a grudge against you
and wanted to revenge?

146
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,530
That's what they asked.

147
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,867
It's already getting noisy.
Just go home today.

148
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,494
My mother-in-law is visiting.

149
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,454
I plan on working overtime.

150
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,665
<i>You'll have to do it alone.</i>

151
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,334
I'm clocking out when I'm done.

152
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,835
That's a surprise.

153
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,922
You always worked overtime
and lived out of your office.

154
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,424
Did you turn over a new leaf
after transferring?

155
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,134
<i>I doubt you're meeting a woman.</i>

156
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,136
What? I can't go meet with a woman?

157
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:39,555
You know very well.

158
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,975
- Know what?
<i>- You have no private life.</i>

159
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,477
You immerse yourself
in work on weekends and holidays.

160
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,146
Due to excessive workloads,
your subordinates suffer

161
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,983
loss of appetite, ulcers, migraines,
hair loss, and depression.

162
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,484
Then, they quit or go on leave.

163
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,902
I was one of those people.

164
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,988
While getting help for depression…

165
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,448
I met my wife.

166
00:10:57,532 --> 00:11:00,368
Then, shouldn't you thank me?
You met her because of me.

167
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,285
That's not all!

168
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,829
<i>The moment you start work,</i>

169
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:06,708
<i>you become super focused, super intense,
and super sensitive. Do you remember?</i>

170
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,836
For replacing the old shredder,
you had me shred the new shredder.

171
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,254
It was like bam!

172
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,172
What are you looking at, punk?

173
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,467
<i>I love how you never change.</i>

174
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:18,511
You say whatever's on your mind.

175
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,971
<i>I did that on purpose.</i>

176
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,973
My wife told me

177
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,559
to let my inner rage out like this.

178
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:27,437
People with anger disorders
have… serotonin?

179
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,523
They say it's due to
excessive levels. But--

180
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,233
Hello?

181
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,901
What?

182
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,112
He must be busy.

183
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,240
Well, so much for wanting
to catch up over dinner.

184
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:44,078
He always said he couldn't get
any work done without me.

185
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:45,580
So he even followed me here.

186
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,083
That's right! Gye Ji-ung!

187
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,172
Good luck.

188
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:00,762
DOGAVILL WALLPAPER & REAL ESTATE

189
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,223
It would've been nice
if this was pork shoulder.

190
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,475
Be happy you got pork leg.

191
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:09,062
Can't you be grateful
and just quietly eat?

192
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,146
I mean,

193
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:14,233
this is my building but I haven't raised
your rent for the last 20 years.

194
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:18,196
Is pork shoulder
really that much to ask for?

195
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,698
I'm only worth pork legs to you?
Is that it?

196
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,117
You're barking up the wrong tree.

197
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,661
You'll have to deal
with my wife about the rent.

198
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,455
There's no point in talking to me.

199
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:32,585
I shouldn't have taken you
to Kwak's Coffeehouse downtown.

200
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,170
- I wasted my time--
- Hey!

201
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,506
Don't even bring up Kwak's Coffeehouse!

202
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:40,384
Also, I don't get to eat
pork shoulder either.

203
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,762
That's nothing to brag about.

204
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,806
I bet Mi-jin gets to. Right?

205
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,933
She's your daughter, after all.

206
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,352
It hasn't been that long for her either.

207
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,021
It was only after she passed
her civil servant exam.

208
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,982
Wow, Ms. Lim.

209
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,361
She's a real piece of work.

210
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,655
Just stop talking

211
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,865
and thankfully eat what you're given.

212
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,495
Goodness, come on in.
Are you looking for a place?

213
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,663
Please sit here.

214
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,415
I don't have much time.
Could we make it quick?

215
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,167
- Is that so?
- Yes.

216
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:16,212
Tell me what you're looking for.
I'll get you what you want.

217
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,882
I have luxurious studio apartments
ready to move in to.

218
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,093
I have everything ready.

219
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,803
Is there a place I can move into now?

220
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,513
Of course!

221
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:29,809
By any chance,

222
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,979
do you have weak energy?

223
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,857
What does energy
have to do with renting a place?

224
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,194
When it comes to finding the right place,

225
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,780
feng shui is a very important factor,

226
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:44,907
and they're closely connected.

227
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,286
By any chance,

228
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,705
do you see ghosts often?

229
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,748
I don't see them or believe in them.

230
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:53,833
Really?

231
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:59,380
Then, I have the perfect place for you.

232
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,759
All right, this is the place I mentioned.

233
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,220
Keep your shoes on. It's okay.

234
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,973
Wow, it's nice! Isn't it?

235
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,309
Good, right?

236
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,519
When it comes to this place,

237
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,980
you get a lot of natural sunlight.

238
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,524
I guess it's pretty cloudy today.

239
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,694
It's fine. I won't be home
when the sun's up anyway.

240
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:22,862
It's just for sleep.

241
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,322
Is that so?

242
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:25,781
Well, then.

243
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,202
You were just destined for this place.

244
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,620
It's perfect.

245
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,537
Will it be okay?

246
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,208
Of course, it will!

247
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,629
What kind of problem could there be?

248
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,089
You can go around all over this city,

249
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:46,928
but you won't find a place like this
for this price with all these amenities.

250
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:51,224
This house gives off
an ominous feeling though.

251
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,354
I'll take it.

252
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,065
I'll sign and move in today.

253
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,320
Welcome to the world of darkness.

254
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,950
Let's go and sign that contract.

255
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,035
Don't mind him.

256
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,287
His wife beats him,
so his head's out of whack.

257
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,999
Let's go, okay? Let's sign it. Come on.

258
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,379
Hello, my dears!

259
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,923
It's Do Ga-yeong,
your beauty content creator.

260
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:27,260
My dears, I know you'll relate to this.

261
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:31,138
You're crying in the bathroom at work
because your boss made you so angry.

262
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,391
When suddenly…

263
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,602
When suddenly, you…

264
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:37,812
Excuse me.

265
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,774
So for you, I've prepared something…

266
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,320
Didn't you see the sign
that said I was filming?

267
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,656
- Yeah, I did.
- I have to start over because of you.

268
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:49,574
Were you crying?

269
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,992
No, it was for the video.

270
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,369
What's with your clothes? What is this?

271
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,037
Stop asking me questions.

272
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,622
Just eat this.

273
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,710
Why do you only come over
at night these days?

274
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,295
Is it because of your new job?

275
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,923
I'm doing it for you.
I don't want you to faint during the day.

276
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,341
Right, I could faint.

277
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:10,469
My friend, Mi-jin, finally has a job.

278
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,639
Who knew I'd live to see the day?

279
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:14,849
I know.

280
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,393
The result after spending
eight years on studying…

281
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,937
<i>was a public service intern.</i>

282
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:24,066
Wow, I love the look
in your eyes right now.

283
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,276
There's a story there.

284
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,446
- Want to shoot a short video?
- No.

285
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,239
- Just one.
- Please disappear.

286
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,365
Just one video!

287
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:32,700
- Don't!
- Just one!

288
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,243
- Just one video!
- Stop it!

289
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,293
- I was wondering.
- What?

290
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,794
I saw on social media

291
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,881
that some good makeup
could really change how someone looks.

292
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,842
Making someone look
30 years younger would be easy, right?

293
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,427
It's doable.

294
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,887
You just have to be reborn.

295
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,555
You brat.

296
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:58,643
Well, instead of just wearing makeup,
it would be a transformation.

297
00:16:58,726 --> 00:16:59,894
Like a superhero.

298
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:03,314
Why? Your mom doesn't care
about makeup. Who is it?

299
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,024
It's someone else.

300
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,443
Someone who aged suddenly.

301
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:08,778
What is this?

302
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,573
Seriously, I was born in 1996.

303
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,165
By the way, can you put up
an ad for me on your channel?

304
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,416
A paid ad?

305
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,626
A free ad.

306
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,003
This is so cute!
What is it? Did you draw it?

307
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:30,132
It's a long story,
but it disappeared right after we met.

308
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,843
Was it a stray cat?
Why are you looking for it?

309
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:38,891
<i>I don't know if this is a miracle or not,
but it seems related to that cat somehow.</i>

310
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,477
Hello?

311
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:43,896
Put it up. I'll tell you later.

312
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:45,815
Okay.

313
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,942
I'm only doing this because it's you.

314
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:52,530
I passed the haunted house
on my way up here, and the light was on.

315
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,198
Do you think it's the ghost?

316
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,033
Right. Hey.

317
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,327
A man moved in there.

318
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,871
- Really? That place?
- Yeah! That place.

319
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,707
Isn't my dad so harsh?

320
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,877
I know he's blinded by money,
but how can you rent that house out?

321
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,754
Gosh, will he be okay?

322
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,715
I don't know. It's his problem now.

323
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,259
He's better off than I am.

324
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,636
I have to film this.
Be quiet for a second.

325
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,721
Okay.

326
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:20,099
- Hi! No, they can see you.
- I've been in them before.

327
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,517
Get down.

328
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,394
- You're so mean.
- A bit more.

329
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,854
Those 200,000 followers? So what?

330
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,106
Just get down,
and it's a million followers.

331
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,107
Wasn't it 200,000?

332
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,234
What are you talking about?

333
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,653
Seriously. They can see.

What?

where were you
during your ten-minute break?

354
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:35,539
I went to the bathroom,
and I went for a walk.

355
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,125
Is that so? Hold on.

Just a moment.

357
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,296
It's the same brand
as this cigarette butt.

358
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,714
Did you bite this off?

359
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,007
- Good grief.
- Hold on.

360
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,718
- I need to record the evidence.
- Come on.

361
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:48,886

You have proof this is mine?

- I do!
- Do you have proof?

368

Goodness, it's so clean.

391
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,663
- You idiot.
- What did you say?

392
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,164
- Do you know who I am?
- Stop.

393
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:00,707

00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,753
- Seriously!
- Goodness!

396
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,005
Stop fighting. That's enough!

397
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,133
Also, you threw the first punch,

398
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:13,804
so pay for dinner tonight
to let us make peace.

399
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,014
He should be the one to pay!

400
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,724
He treated me like a criminal.

401
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:18,934
That's nonsense.

402
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,936
It'll be cheaper than a fine.

403
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,109
I'm innocent! Why should I?

404
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,527
The CCTV? So what?

405
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:32,322
Then, go to the security room
and look at the footage!

406
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:33,657
Yeah, let's do that!

407
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,285
- I'm a witness!
- Right! Let's go!

408
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,786
All right, let's go!

409
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,788
Beef's a bit pricey.

410
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:43,333
If it's pork, I could do it.

411
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,002
Jeez.

412
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,545
It's better than nothing.

413
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,380
How about tomorrow after work? Okay?

414
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:52,467
As long as you're going, it's fine by me.

415
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,054
I'll go as long as we finish early.

416
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:58,098
Will you come too?

417
00:25:58,181 --> 00:25:59,808
Well, I mean…

418
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,351
Sure.

419
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:02,853
You're not invited.

420
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,897
- I'm not going!
- They're fighting again.

421
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,273
- No food for you!
- I won't!

Look at how big

424
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,284
Wait a second.

425
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,536
Wow, don't book any more work for me.

426
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,454
No more.

427
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:23,415
Do you know how troubled I am right now?

428
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,042
See how dark this doctor looks?

429
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,543
This is what darkness is.

430
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:27,920
I feel the same!

431
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,635
Won, just take two years off
and go recuperate somewhere.

432
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,222
Where?

433
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,976
Somewhere with fresh air and clear waters.

434
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,020
Hawaii? Italy?

435
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:46,897
Where?

436
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,399
There's this place…

437
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,860
It's called Dongdu-dong.

438
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:53,654
Donghae?

439
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,365
Why would I go to Donghae?

440
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,532
No.

441
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:00,118
Dongdu-dong.

442
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:01,745

After three weeks
of basic military training,

446
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,559
Ko Won surprised fans with news

447
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:28,563
that he'll work as a public service worker
at Seohan District Prosecutors' Office.

448
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,108
For the first time
in our office's history,

449
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,360
there finally comes a day
when we get attention.

450
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,904
KO WON STARTS WORK
AT SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

451
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:36,863
Yeah.

452
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:39,866

Wow!

456
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,344
Ga-yeong would flip if she saw this.

457
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,056
Is she here?

458
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,918
Ko Won, can you say hello?

459
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:16,671
Did you suddenly decide
to enlist because of the trial's verdict?

460
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,050
Tell us your goals
before you begin your duties.

461
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:26,598
A lot of people have given me support,
so I will sincerely work hard.

462
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,894
Answering the call of your country
is a natural obligation for any citizen.

463
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,020
I'll do my best.

464
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,651
I'll complete my service
without any problems.

465
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,945
Why are there so many people here?

466
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:42,614
What's going on?

467
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,157
Especially, to my fans…

468
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,038
- My Dalgona Family.
- Ko Won!

469
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,249
I love you all!

470
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,432
<i>No way!</i>

471
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,767
<i>This is how my twenties will end?</i>

472
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:12,436
<i>As a 50-year-old lady?</i>

473
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,096
Did you see that Ko Won incident?

474
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,974
Yeah, it makes me so sad.

475
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,310
Was his name Mr. Gye? Did you see him?

476
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:57,230
Doesn't he look so kind and sweet?

477
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:58,315
I saw him.

478
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:03,737
<i>True. He went to great lengths
to help even a stranger like me too.</i>

479
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,363
- He's handsome.
- He's a rare one.

480
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:06,990
It feels so nice now that he's here.

481
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,117
He was the ace prosecutor back in Seoul.

482
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,453
That's why he was in charge
of Ko Won's case.

483
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:14,247
Why is he so handsome?

484
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,792
He's skilled, handsome, and accomplished.

485
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,586
- Isn't he too perfect?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

486
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,796
<i>He was glowing in light
when I first saw him.</i>

487
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,758
He wears glasses? That's just my type.

488
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,471
I can't listen to this anymore.

489
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,683
You all need to raise your standards.

490
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:35,352
What you see isn't everything.

491
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,896
He's nice… when he's not working.

492
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:42,567
But he's a workaholic
who works 20 out of 24 hours a day.

493
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:46,404
If plans or routines are changed,
he becomes upset and his OCD surfaces.

494
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:51,493
He's a social misfit who can't stand it
when people intervene in his life.

495
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,703
Other than that, he's great.

496
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,664
Again, it's as long he's not working.

497
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,667
<i>I better not get involved with him at all.</i>

What's wrong with your voice?

505
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,301
I'm working.

506
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,511
Why did you call?

507
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:53,847
A man is here looking for you.

508
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,224
A man? What for?

509
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,185
Excuse me. What was your name?

510
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:01,479
It's Gye Ji-ung.

511
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,398
Why is he there?

512
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:04,899
This is crazy!

513
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:12,490
I'm so sorry!

514
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,245
What? Wait.

515
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,039
Isn't that Sun?

516
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,290
You're right. It's her.

517
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,917
That's the same color
of the coat she wore to work.

518
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,586
Same length of hair.

519
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,464
That's the same backpack
she always carries around too.

520
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,132
Goodness, look at that stamina.

521
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,426
She rides her bike to and from work.

522
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,219
I'm sorry, Ok-hui.

523
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,889
I had to clean up.

524
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,351
What are we to do?

525
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,479
Something urgent came up
and Lim Sun just suddenly left.

526
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:46,441
We'll have to save
today's social gathering for another day.

527
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,525
Well, then…

528
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,320
- Bye.
- What?

529
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,365
Gosh, it's for the best.

530
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,617
Now, let's forget the women.

531
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,327
Let's grab a drink together.

00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,620
I'm going home.

533
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,580
Didn't you say you'd stuff your face?

534
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:01,748
You two stuff your faces.

535
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:05,001
It's okay with me.

536
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:07,837
- Where should we go?
- I swear.

537
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:11,549
Some people just don't have
the basics down.

538
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,302
That's so annoying.

539
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:27,982
<i>Dad, great job today.</i>

540
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,527
<i>Do you want me
to pick you up after dinner?</i>

541
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,695
<i>I'm just happy</i>

542
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:35,156
<i>to at least have a chance
to work like this.</i>

543
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,743
<i>You don't have to come out and pick me up.</i>

544
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,829
<i>The dinner was canceled.</i>

545
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,580
<i>On my way home,</i>

546
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,290
<i>I'll buy you something tasty.</i>

547
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,486
How do you know my daughter?

548
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,824
<i>We met by chance
on my way to a work meeting.</i>

549
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,033
<i>Work?</i>

550
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,201
Are you an office worker?

551
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:22,871
A civil servant.

552
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,414
Civil servant?

553
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,710
Goodness, so you're a civil servant!

554
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,211
That's great!

555
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:31,671
Just a moment.

556
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,631
Hold on. Where are my manners?

557
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:50,190
What's that?

558
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,274
Look at that!

559
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,317
Wow, that's sick!

560
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,443
Look at that!

561
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,069
Lady! Hey, lady!

562
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,905
I can't believe that lady!

563
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,948
- Hey, lady!
- Go!

564
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:01,034
<i>My daughter's a civil servant too.</i>

565
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,411
She already got a job?

566
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:04,913
What do you mean "already"?

567
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,456
She turned 30 before getting a job.

568
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:11,336
Still, it's a job with security
and one she can have until retirement.

569
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:27,227
May I ask about your parents?

570
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:29,395
They're not around.

571
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,150
But if they were around,

572
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:36,861
there could be conflicts
between your wife and her in-laws.

573
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:39,823
Instead, being happily together in love

574
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,658
is the best.

575
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:43,243
Don't you think?

576
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,332
Where in the world is she?

577
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,085
She said she'd come straight after work.

578
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,004
By the way,

579
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,090
you're so handsome-- I mean…

580
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,425
What business led to you meet Mi-jin?

581
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:03,096
I mean, what department do you work in?

582
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:04,722
Well, I'm…

583
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:10,854
What's that lady doing here?

584
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,481
Ma'am!

585
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,824
Was it not her?

586
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:42,969
Jeez!

587
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,686
Damn it.

588
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,647
Jeez. Seriously!

589
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:57,942
You'll see how smart Mi-jin is
once you get to know her.

590
00:37:58,026 --> 00:37:58,860
My goodness.

591
00:37:58,943 --> 00:37:59,819
Excuse me.

592
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:01,696
- What's with you?
- What brings you here?

593
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:02,780
Thank you for the coffee.

594
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,616
Don't mention it.

595
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,533
That's right!

596
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,160
I am so forgetful!

597
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:10,163
I should've offered you
some of my organic fig <i>cheong</i>.

598
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,164
No, it's fine.

599
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,498
- Please come again.
- Let's talk.

600
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:13,875
You should go back home.

601
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,543
- Get the figs--
- Go inside, Mom!

602
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:16,669
- I'll be back.
- The figs…

603
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,380
What's with that girl?

604
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,096
Did you tell my mom about that day?

605
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,473
You don't have to worry.

606
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,975
I didn't say a word about the job fraud.

607
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,101
That's a relief.

608
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:36,856
It's just… I'm still trying to fix things,
so she doesn't know.

609
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,775
That's your business, not mine.

610
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,276
Right.

611
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,668
Is there something on my face?

612
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,547
I guess you do look like
you were born in 1996.

613
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:03,591
How do you know how old I am?

614
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:11,182
This looks familiar.

615
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,353
Isn't that Mi-jin?

616
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,480
- Hak-chan.
- What?

617
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,566
Mi-jin's over there with some guy.

618
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:21,609
A guy?

619
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,152
Hey, that guy!

620
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:25,863
Where are you going? Are you crazy?

621
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,323
Things are going well!

622
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:29,659
Are you trying to ruin her love life?

623
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,119
No, it's just…

624
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,621
I've never seen her with a guy before.

625
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:34,998
Goodness.

626
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,086
Our documents were switched,
and I'd like mine back.

627
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,629
I see. They were switched.

628
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:45,133
- You didn't even check?
- This isn't that important to me.

629
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:48,428
I would've prepared them
if you'd called ahead.

630
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,387
Hold on.

631
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,222
Are you pretending not to remember?

632
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,100
When I called,
you spewed those vulgar words at me.

633
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,435
Do you know how hurt…

634
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:58,104
I did?

635
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,441
Come on. No way.

636
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,568
What? Wow!

637
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,611
I called you 27 times after that.

638
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:08,614
But you ignored me,
so I'm assuming you've blocked me.

639
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:10,908
You must've called the wrong number.

640
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:11,993
Wrong number?

641
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,665
Look.

642
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,501
Hey, that's my number.

643
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:23,087
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

644
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:24,088
Is it ringing?

645
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,466
Why are you blocked?

646
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,093
<i>Is it you again? The prosecutor?</i>

647
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:33,097
Hey, you crazy psycho!
Who do you think you are to call me back?

648
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:39,812
- Look, I can explain.
- Forget it.

649
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:41,064
Just give me my papers.

650
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,567
I'll go home and find them for you.

651
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,111
Would you like some quince tea and wait?

652
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:49,113
No. It'd be a hassle for both of us.

653
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:50,114
I'll wait outside.

654
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:52,784
I live near here.

655
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,452
To the right…

656
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,204
I mean, it's just to the left.

657
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,164
Look at her.

658
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,707
She's leading the way.

659
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:00,625
Look!

660
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,376
- Wait.
- Where are they going?

661
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,337
She's leading the way. It's over now.

662
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,156
Did I leave it here?

663
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,328
I must've thrown everything away.

664
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,251
This is bad.

665
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:00,726
By any chance,

666
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:03,271
were those documents important?

667
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,481
Yes.

668
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,278
So the thing is…

669
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,697
Those documents…

670
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,450
What happened was…

671
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,752
Are you saying you burned
my documents without permission?

672
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:28,671
I didn't know they were yours.

673
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:31,799
I'm sorry.

674
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:35,344
After wasting my time, labor,
and emotions, you're sorry…

675
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:37,263
Do you think "sorry" will cut it?

676
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:43,728
They weren't related to your work, right?

677
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:46,314
Even if they weren't,
they shouldn't be burned.

678
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:50,610
Unfortunately, they were
very relevant to my work. And?

679
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:56,616
If you're willing to grant this,
why didn't you just grant me a job?

680
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:01,120
You could get money for those
from a used bookstore!

681
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:05,791
I promise I'll do whatever it takes
to make it up to you.

682
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:08,920
Forget it.

683
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:09,962
No, wait.

684
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,256
Please let me fix this.

685
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,134
Let's not. Don't waste your time.

686
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:18,095
This is my fault.
I'll take responsibility.

687
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,641
I don't think
you're in a position to say that.

688
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,812
Are you saying you can't trust
a dumb loser who was scammed?

689
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:29,607
An inferiority complex.

690
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:31,984
Let's go.

691
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:35,071
I'll find and give them to you
in front of your own eyes.

692
00:43:35,905 --> 00:43:36,906
Follow me.

693
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,410
Hello.

694
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:42,495
Hi.

695
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:46,082
Sir, I think I left
something behind last time.

696
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:48,084
- Can I look for it? Thank you.
- Sure.

697
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:54,298
You're not going to
look for it here, are you?

698
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,886
Don't worry. I may not look like it,

699
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,889
but I have the top score
in the hidden object game at the arcade.

700
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:03,766
No, you look like it.

701
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,018
Thank you.

702
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,521
Why aren't you looking?

703
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:10,606
I'm going to now.

704
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,178
Seriously, where did it go?

705
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,349
Where is it?

706
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:47,309
Wow, look at this.

707
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:49,437
I think it could be here.

708
00:44:57,236 --> 00:45:01,907
"Study Book."

709
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:08,039
Jeez, I almost cursed.

710
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:14,045
"Civil Servant." It's not here.

711
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:21,677
Are you okay?

712
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:22,762
Yes.

713
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:31,187
"Civil Servant."

714
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,909
Where did Mi-jin go?
What in the world is she up to?

715
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:45,951
Why isn't she home yet?

716
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:47,411
For goodness' sake.

717
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:51,290
What are you doing?
They're having a good time.

718
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,376
Your daughter left with a strange man.

719
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,796
It's late and she's not home.
You're not worried?

720
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:59,340
I'd be worried if she did come home!

721
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,841
She's basically 30 now.

722
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:02,968
She's never even held hands with a man.

723
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:05,054
At this rate, when she ends up

724
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,723
as a 60-year-old virgin

725
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:09,892
taking care of her old parents,
will you wake up?

726
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,519
Why would you say that?

727
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:17,024
I mean…

728
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,276
Having grandchildren would be nice.

729
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,402
Tonight's the night.

730
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:25,324
The night we get grandchildren.

731
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,037
Don't overreact.

732
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,415
Be normal. Act natural.

733
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:49,765
You already looked there.

734
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,768
There are so many books
that I got confused.

735
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:57,898
Why are you nagging
if you're not even going to help?

736
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,405
You looked there exactly 19 minutes ago.

737
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,616
That's why I'm looking next to it.

738
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,410
- You looked there too.
- I know.

739
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:10,995
I was going to look next to that.

740
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,663
Yeah, you looked there too.

741
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:15,166
I meant this shelf that's next to that.

742
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:19,461
Is that a civil service prep book?

743
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,463
Wait a second.

744
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:23,507
Civil service…

745
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:39,064
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

746
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,027
Why is it so hot?

747
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,530
Are you hot?

748
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:14,493
Did the owner turn on the heater?

749
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:16,328
Why is it so hot today?

750
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:19,748
What's with these sleeves?

751
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:25,587
Try this.

752
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:32,636
Nice.

754
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:28,627
YOU CAN DO IT, MI-JIN

755
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:36,802
You must've studied hard
for the civil servant exam.

756
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:39,972
That's all I did.

757
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:42,266
I was needlessly too diligent.

758
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,601
I failed each time though.

759
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:48,188
But why did you keep retaking it?

760
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:50,399
I didn't really have a dream.

761
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,192
I wasn't good at anything.

762
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:55,404
My mom wanted me
as a civil servant, so I figured I'd try.

763
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,328
I must look pathetic to someone
who's good at everything like you.

764
00:52:03,412 --> 00:52:04,288
No, I'm jealous.

765
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:07,875
My dream's to live
without any purpose or thoughts.

766
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:13,797
You really do have a knack
for subtly insulting people.

767
00:52:17,009 --> 00:52:18,010
What are you looking at?

768
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:20,471
This.

769
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:26,810
- Where'd you find this?
- Shelf 15, section three.

770
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:28,145
That's over here.

771
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:29,354
- Yes.
- Section three…

772
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:32,191
This is it!

773
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:34,735
- It's here!
- Next to that.

774
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,446
No, it's here. Wait a second.

775
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:39,448
Here.

776
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:42,868
Hello, Detective Kwon.

777
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:45,746
What?

778
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:49,124
Here it is! Wait.

779
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:53,795
I found it!

780
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:58,509
Wow, I really thought I wouldn't find it!

781
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:04,973
Mr. Gye?

782
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:08,685
What?

783
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:11,063
He acted as if he'd observe all night.

784
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:36,255
<i>Mom!</i>

785
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:38,924
- What happened?
- Goodness.

786
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:39,883
Again?

787
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:50,394
<i>Mom!</i>

788
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:58,402
You always asked me to give you a call
if we ever discovered a dismembered body.

789
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,737
I'd kept that in mind.

790
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:03,865
But who knew it would really happen?

791
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:06,034
Hey!

792
00:54:06,535 --> 00:54:07,536
Come here.

793
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:12,040
Who is he? Did you call him?

794
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:13,750
I'm not here to steal your case.

795
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:16,169
It'll come to us anyway. I came to check.

796
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,421
Check what?

797
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:19,548
To see if we're doing our jobs right?

798
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:21,341
Don't be like this, sir.

799
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:24,052
I called him.
He has to work on the case anyways.

800
00:54:24,136 --> 00:54:25,429
Forget it.

801
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,055
You punk.

802
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:29,349
Just keep it short and go.

803
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,185
When was this discovered?

804
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,229
An old man came to clear

805
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,148
frost from his greenhouse.

806
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:39,276
He came out before dawn
to work when he found this.

807
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,861
The damn bastard

808
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:43,363
left a body part here for everyone to see.

809
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:02,651
Why isn't he coming back?

810
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,319
I finally found it.

811
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:10,534
Should I just leave?

812
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,121
I could just give it to him tomorrow.

813
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:21,002
WE BUY AND SELL USED BOOKS

814
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:43,942
<i>You didn't leave
because you were angry, did you?</i>

815
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:46,862
Is this too meek?

816
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:48,405
<i>What happened?</i>

817
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:50,490
<i>You were acting
as if you'd observe all night.</i>

818
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:52,951
Is this is too aggressive?

819
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:59,708
It has to sound very formal and distant,

820
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:04,212
but it can't sound too dry either.

821
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:08,759
It needs to be a cool text
that sounds slightly friendly.

822
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:12,512
A very cool text.

823
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:16,183
<i>I waited, but it got late. So I left.</i>

824
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:19,352
So cool.

825
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:06,191
<i>It'd take 15 minutes at most
for an adult to cover 550 meters.</i>

826
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:10,237
<i>Since the ground hasn't dried yet,</i>

827
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,197
<i>it's been less than 30 minutes.</i>

828
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:15,700
- Detective Kwon!
- Yes?

829
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:17,327
The witness didn't see anyone?

830
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,870
The killer's probably already fled!

831
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:23,500
<i>The killer was surprised
or flustered by something.</i>

832
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:28,964
Look over there!

833
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,050
<i>Or they're hiding.</i>

834
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:34,970
<i>Maybe to fix a mistake?</i>

835
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:38,140
<i>The culprit could still be at the scene.</i>

836
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,423
Damn it.

837
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:43,205
Detective Kwon!

838
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:45,373
Stop all vehicles headed toward Daeho-ri!

839
00:59:45,457 --> 00:59:46,333
