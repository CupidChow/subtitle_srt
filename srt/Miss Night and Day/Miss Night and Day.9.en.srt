ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,

7
00:00:34,903 --> 00:00:35,904
Well…

8
00:00:36,613 --> 00:00:39,491
What happens if someone was
temporarily insane due to alcohol?

9
00:00:40,075 --> 00:00:41,076
What?

10
00:00:42,828 --> 00:00:44,413
Well, sentence reduction

11
00:00:44,496 --> 00:00:46,707
will depend on if the incident
was an accident or not.

12
00:00:47,374 --> 00:00:48,625
I see.

13
00:00:50,752 --> 00:00:51,753
Why?

14
00:00:54,047 --> 00:00:55,465
Then, this isn't an accident.

15
00:00:56,049 --> 00:00:57,009
What isn't an accident?

16
00:01:19,364 --> 00:01:20,282
What's this…

17
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,160
doing here?

18
00:01:26,204 --> 00:01:27,205
- Damn it.
- Wait.

19
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:31,084
I'm going to go home.

20
00:01:31,168 --> 00:01:33,045
I should go.

21
00:01:33,128 --> 00:01:35,881
I thought you were going to
headbutt me again.

22
00:01:35,964 --> 00:01:37,382
The place is a mess as well.

23
00:01:37,883 --> 00:01:38,717
Wait…

24
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,510
It's like PTSD.

25
00:01:41,678 --> 00:01:43,555
Damn it.

26
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,938
My gosh!

27
00:01:52,564 --> 00:01:54,650
I don't believe it! This is crazy!

28
00:01:56,109 --> 00:01:57,235
Goodness.

29
00:01:58,612 --> 00:02:01,114
Hey, they're kissing! My gosh!

30
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,533
On the lips! Kiss her!

31
00:02:03,617 --> 00:02:04,493
They're kissing!

32
00:02:04,576 --> 00:02:06,286
I can't believe… My goodness!

33
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:10,290
What's it to you if they make out or not?
Be quiet so I can sleep!

34
00:02:10,874 --> 00:02:13,377
- I can't even live vicariously?
- No, you can't.

35
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:15,003
Wait.

36
00:02:16,004 --> 00:02:17,005
Hey, wait.

37
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:18,715
Did something happen?

38
00:02:19,216 --> 00:02:20,342
- Tell me what happened.
- No.

39
00:02:20,425 --> 00:02:21,426
Nothing happened.

40
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,513
Why are you blushing
and hiding under the blankets?

41
00:02:24,596 --> 00:02:26,807
- Me? No way.
- Something did happen.

42
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,350
- I know you. Tell me.
- What?

43
00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:30,018
- Nothing happened.
- Yes, it did.

44
00:02:30,143 --> 00:02:31,103
- Don't!
- I know you.

45
00:02:31,186 --> 00:02:32,187
I know you.

46
00:02:33,563 --> 00:02:34,689
What is it?

47
00:02:35,649 --> 00:02:36,650
Well…

48
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:37,734
Yeah?

49
00:02:41,363 --> 00:02:42,489
- It's just…
- Yeah?

50
00:02:43,782 --> 00:02:44,616
Well…

51
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:45,534
Have you…

52
00:02:46,493 --> 00:02:47,494
ever kissed before?

53
00:02:49,371 --> 00:02:50,288
Yeah, I have.

54
00:02:50,372 --> 00:02:51,415
Yeah, okay.

55
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:53,708
- With a palm?
- What?

56
00:02:53,792 --> 00:02:54,793
With a palm.

57
00:02:55,752 --> 00:02:56,586
What?

58
00:02:57,754 --> 00:02:58,839
- With a palm.
- What?

59
00:02:58,922 --> 00:03:00,507
- With a palm.
- With a palm?

60
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,425
- Yeah.
- Why?

61
00:03:01,508 --> 00:03:02,426
Good question.

62
00:03:05,178 --> 00:03:06,012
What the hell?

63
00:03:07,472 --> 00:03:09,766
Did Mr. Gye try to kiss you?

64
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,017
And you blocked him?

65
00:03:11,101 --> 00:03:13,437
That's crazy! I don't believe it!

66
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,855
- He blocked me.
- What?

67
00:03:14,938 --> 00:03:17,232
- He blocked me.
- He did? Why?

68
00:03:18,817 --> 00:03:19,735
He blocked you?

69
00:03:20,902 --> 00:03:22,654
Wait, he blocked you?

70
00:03:29,453 --> 00:03:30,454
My goodness!

71
00:03:30,537 --> 00:03:32,497
He blocked you! How embarrassing!

72
00:03:33,874 --> 00:03:36,001
That's so damn embarrassing!

73
00:03:36,084 --> 00:03:37,377
He blocked you!

74
00:03:37,461 --> 00:03:40,756
I have to see him at work tomorrow.
What do I do?

75
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:42,466
I can't face him. I'm too embarrassed.

76
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:45,135
You're such a hot mess
when you drink, Mi-jin.

77
00:03:45,218 --> 00:03:46,428
You take the cake.

78
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:48,889
Seriously, what do I do?

79
00:03:48,972 --> 00:03:51,808
Wait, that means… Don't tell me you…

80
00:03:52,392 --> 00:03:55,937
When I asked you to buy food for me,
were you downstairs at his place?

81
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,398
I'm going to kill you.

82
00:03:58,482 --> 00:04:00,233
I was hungry my hands were shaking.

83
00:04:07,824 --> 00:04:08,825
What in the world?

84
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:50,325
Do you have any Sangiovese?

85
00:04:50,408 --> 00:04:52,202
Or any other vintage wines?

86
00:04:52,285 --> 00:04:53,703
That's all we have there.

87
00:04:54,704 --> 00:04:55,622
Okay.

88
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:02,128
- Lee Mi-jin.
- Welcome.

89
00:05:02,212 --> 00:05:03,171
Are you buying?

90
00:05:03,255 --> 00:05:04,714
- Be quiet.
- Are you buying?

91
00:05:04,798 --> 00:05:06,299
- I'll buy.
- Nice!

92
00:05:06,383 --> 00:05:08,385
Still, don't grab too much stuff. Okay?

93
00:05:08,468 --> 00:05:10,262
Come on. You said you'd buy.

94
00:05:10,804 --> 00:05:11,972
Can I buy this too?

95
00:05:12,597 --> 00:05:13,723
Get whatever you want.

96
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:17,477
<i>Wait. Why am I hiding?</i>

97
00:05:22,357 --> 00:05:24,109
I need something to drink.

98
00:05:25,277 --> 00:05:27,612
- Just beer won't cut it tonight.
- You're crazy.

99
00:05:27,696 --> 00:05:28,613
- Hey.
- What?

100
00:05:28,697 --> 00:05:29,948
To get drunk and mess up again?

101
00:05:30,031 --> 00:05:31,283
- Don't stop me.
- That's enough.

102
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:32,826
- Stop it.
- That's enough.

103
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:35,453
- I said let go. Don't stop me.
- That's enough!

104
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:38,373
Let go!

105
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,966
Crap. Did it hit someone?

106
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,718
Why did you stop me?

107
00:06:12,324 --> 00:06:13,325
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,621
What is it?

109
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:29,174
By any chance…

110
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:32,302
- Is that…
- Yes, I was going to give it to you.

111
00:06:41,853 --> 00:06:43,438
- Hello.
- Hello.

112
00:06:47,776 --> 00:06:49,027
You found it.

113
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,029
- There it is.
- Yeah, it was here.

114
00:07:00,246 --> 00:07:01,081
Yes.

115
00:07:01,164 --> 00:07:02,332
I mean, no. Keep the receipt.

116
00:07:05,752 --> 00:07:09,214
You said you didn't drink,
but I see you're already restocking.

117
00:07:09,297 --> 00:07:12,300
I drink a little from time to time
when I'm tired or upset.

118
00:07:12,926 --> 00:07:14,094
I was out anyway.

119
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:16,930
I see. You were upset.

120
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:18,723
No.

121
00:07:18,807 --> 00:07:21,059
- That's not what I meant.
- I made a mistake…

122
00:07:24,104 --> 00:07:25,021
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:26,314 --> 00:07:28,984
I didn't mean
to cause you so much trouble.

124
00:07:31,778 --> 00:07:32,904
No, I'm sorry.

125
00:07:35,865 --> 00:07:37,367
Sorry about what?

126
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:39,035
What?

127
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:44,040
- I mean…
- I suddenly want spicy pig's trotters!

128
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:47,168
I'd better buy some
on my way home then, right?

129
00:07:49,254 --> 00:07:51,381
So you two don't have to worry about me.

130
00:07:51,464 --> 00:07:52,882
Just have a nice talk and…

131
00:07:52,966 --> 00:07:54,926
What? Hey, where are you going?

132
00:07:58,346 --> 00:07:59,681
Have a good night.

133
00:07:59,764 --> 00:08:01,224
Hey, Mi-jin!

134
00:08:26,249 --> 00:08:28,043
Sorry about what?

135
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:45,602
Why is this all crumpled?

136
00:08:51,691 --> 00:08:53,902
It's the autopsy report
for Baek Cheol-gyu's wife.

137
00:08:53,985 --> 00:08:55,653
They found fentanyl in her blood.

138
00:08:55,737 --> 00:08:59,199
He had easy access to drugs,
so he became the prime suspect.

139
00:08:59,282 --> 00:09:02,327
That's when they discovered
his wife's affair.

140
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,787
He was suspected even more.

141
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,122
There was speculation
but no hard evidence.

142
00:09:06,206 --> 00:09:07,624
His alibi was also solid.

143
00:09:07,707 --> 00:09:10,627
And they couldn't ignore
his respected status in the community.

<i>Both had fentanyl in their blood.</i>

148
00:09:53,711 --> 00:09:55,713
<i>I asked forensics for the photos</i>

of the recently found severed foot
and Kang Gyeong-hui's severed wrist.

150

What were the results?

151
00:10:01,761 --> 00:10:03,263
They appear to be the same.

152
00:10:04,097 --> 00:10:05,682
<i>If the victim had died,</i>

153
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,518
<i>why would the culprit reappear now</i>

154

<i>well after 20 years?</i>

155
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:12,313
Why would he have been so cruel?

156
00:10:15,608 --> 00:10:17,193
<i>Because it wasn't planned.</i>

157
00:10:24,075 --> 00:10:26,286
<i>There was a murder,
but if it was an accident</i>

158
00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:28,246

I'm sorry for calling so late.

During your search
after you found that body part,

167
00:11:23,927 --> 00:11:25,303
did you check the reservoir too?

168
00:11:25,386 --> 00:11:27,931
Yes, we took a boat out
and searched the whole area.

<i>We sent in divers too.</i>

170
00:11:29,515 --> 00:11:30,934
You didn't find anything?

171
00:11:31,017 --> 00:11:33,645
That reservoir is very deep.

172
00:11:33,728 --> 00:11:35,313
There was bad visibility.

Good morning.

You two look rough.

00:12:17,271 --> 00:12:18,606
- No, I don't.
- No, I don't.

No, nothing happened.

183
00:12:29,867 --> 00:12:32,203
I drink a little from time to time
when I'm tired or upset.

184
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,543
Damn it! Why won't this work?

185
00:12:38,626 --> 00:12:39,627
Seriously?

186
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:43,548
Why is this thing acting up?

187
00:12:51,764 --> 00:12:53,266
I guess it was out of staples.

188
00:12:54,892 --> 00:12:56,144
DAEHO RESERVOIR
DAEHO-RI

189
00:12:57,103 --> 00:12:58,021
Ms. Lim?

190
00:12:58,104 --> 00:12:59,188
What?

191
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:03,901
Well…

192
00:13:04,736 --> 00:13:05,945
If it's not urgent,

193
00:13:06,821 --> 00:13:08,072
please tell me later.

194
00:13:09,907 --> 00:13:11,325
Well, it's not urgent.

195
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:13,036
But you know the area of Daeho-ri well.

196
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:14,412
- Could you--
- No, I don't.

197
00:13:15,038 --> 00:13:16,372
You said you were from there.

198
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,751
So that means I must know
its geography too?

199
00:13:21,878 --> 00:13:23,337
Well, no.

200
00:13:24,672 --> 00:13:25,548
Then, after work--

201
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,967
You still don't know
I don't work overtime?

202
00:13:29,302 --> 00:13:30,136
I do.

203
00:13:30,219 --> 00:13:35,183
And from now on, I refuse
to work overtime or do special tasks.

204
00:13:35,266 --> 00:13:36,184
Bear that in mind.

205
00:13:39,937 --> 00:13:40,855
Jeez.

206
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,111
What did you do wrong?

207
00:13:48,196 --> 00:13:49,864
Good question. What did I do?

208
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:51,532
What's with her?

209
00:13:57,246 --> 00:13:59,791
By the way, is Ms. Lim married?

210
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:01,918
I don't know.

211
00:14:02,001 --> 00:14:03,920
- Why?
- I'm just wondering.

212
00:14:04,003 --> 00:14:06,047
It seems she's always busy at night.

213
00:14:06,798 --> 00:14:07,965
It's no big deal,

214
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:10,426
but it feels like she tries hard
to avoid me at night.

215
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:13,554
I don't know. I thought it was
because her body couldn't keep up,

216
00:14:13,638 --> 00:14:16,599
but she helped us
get into the club that time even at night.

217
00:14:16,682 --> 00:14:19,894
Right, she did have to leave
due to sudden chest pains.

218
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,105
You know, she never works overtime.

219
00:14:22,188 --> 00:14:23,398
Is something going on?

220
00:14:23,481 --> 00:14:26,401
There are no issues with her work,
so it doesn't matter.

221
00:14:26,943 --> 00:14:28,152
But still, it's strange.

222
00:14:29,987 --> 00:14:30,988
Hey.

223
00:14:31,823 --> 00:14:33,157
Sit across from me.

224
00:14:33,241 --> 00:14:34,742
Everyone can see.

225
00:14:34,826 --> 00:14:36,536
Who cares? This is a seat too.

226
00:14:36,619 --> 00:14:38,329
- Damn it.
- We're just eating. So what?

227
00:14:40,123 --> 00:14:41,916
I said I'd buy.

228
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:43,084
Why the cafeteria?

229
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:45,461
We can go out and eat something good.

230
00:14:45,545 --> 00:14:48,714
I have to eat quickly and work
if I want to finish on time.

231
00:14:48,798 --> 00:14:51,509
And I told you to use honorifics here.

232
00:14:53,469 --> 00:14:56,681
But we're around the same age.

233
00:14:56,764 --> 00:14:59,767
This is driving me nuts.
I'm going to kill you.

234
00:15:03,646 --> 00:15:04,689
Come on.

235
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:06,315
Seriously?

236
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,984
Stop.

237
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:09,068
Try it.

238
00:15:10,736 --> 00:15:12,113
You ate it anyway.

239
00:15:13,781 --> 00:15:14,866
Drink some water.

240
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:24,750
Stop it.

241
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:26,961
- Just a second.
- No. Stop.

242
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:29,881
- Stop it.
- Let me just get it.

243
00:15:29,964 --> 00:15:31,340
No, I said it's fine.

244
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:49,817
Jeez.

245
00:15:52,695 --> 00:15:54,322
What are you doing? I'm eating!

246
00:15:54,405 --> 00:15:56,407
Wow, it's so good!

247
00:15:56,491 --> 00:15:57,783
Then, why are you angry?

248
00:15:57,867 --> 00:15:58,868
You're so weird.

249
00:17:18,781 --> 00:17:21,200
THERE'S A SENIOR INTERN
WHO LIED ABOUT THEIR IDENTITY

250
00:17:24,954 --> 00:17:26,205
Yes?

251
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,457
Have you eaten yet?

252
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,918
Yes, I have.

253
00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:35,256
Thank you so much.

254
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:36,716
Would you like me to help?

255
00:17:37,675 --> 00:17:38,509
No, it's fine.

256
00:17:38,593 --> 00:17:41,053
I can do it. It's okay.

257
00:17:43,931 --> 00:17:44,849
Thank you.

258
00:17:53,357 --> 00:17:56,736
THERE'S A SENIOR INTERN
WHO LIED ABOUT THEIR IDENTITY

259
00:18:32,146 --> 00:18:36,901
JINPYEONG-EUP
DAEHO RESERVOIR, DAEHO-RI

260
00:19:09,767 --> 00:19:10,893
Hello, Detective Kwon?

261
00:19:10,976 --> 00:19:13,145
I'm sorry, but can I ask you for a favor?

262
00:19:15,356 --> 00:19:16,357
Mr. Gye!

263
00:19:18,734 --> 00:19:21,862
Did you ask the police to redo
the search for the missing person?

264
00:19:22,363 --> 00:19:24,115
- Yes.
- Who do you think you are?

265
00:19:24,198 --> 00:19:25,366
Who are you to do that?

266
00:19:25,449 --> 00:19:28,077
I was told vision was obstructed,
so the search went poorly.

267
00:19:28,786 --> 00:19:32,289
I'm asking why you're making this fuss
when it's not even your case!

268
00:19:32,373 --> 00:19:33,833
If the victim is dead,

269
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,793
the body will be in the vicinity.

270
00:19:35,876 --> 00:19:37,420
Fine, let's say it's there.

271
00:19:37,503 --> 00:19:39,422
They'd search again
if they can't find it,

272
00:19:39,505 --> 00:19:41,048
or Ms. Tak would take care of it!

273
00:19:41,132 --> 00:19:43,175
So why are you getting involved? Why?

274
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:45,010
Don't you know the longer
a body's submerged

275
00:19:45,094 --> 00:19:46,637
the more difficult an autopsy will be?

276
00:19:46,721 --> 00:19:48,055
What if it's not there?

277
00:19:48,139 --> 00:19:50,099
That's why I'm asking them
to search again.

278
00:19:50,182 --> 00:19:51,517
Are you insane?

279
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,560
Don't get involved.

280
00:19:58,441 --> 00:20:01,277
Don't mention anything
about missing persons again!

281
00:20:01,861 --> 00:20:02,695
Got it?

282
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,844
DETAILS OF MISSING PERSON

283
00:20:29,513 --> 00:20:30,514
DAEHO-RI 1.3 KM

284
00:20:43,611 --> 00:20:46,071
I left the convenience store
so you could talk.

285
00:20:46,155 --> 00:20:47,406
But you just left!

286
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:50,034
<i>That's when you should've talked it out.</i>

287
00:20:50,117 --> 00:20:52,286
<i>Has he called you at all?</i>

288
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:55,206
He's been really busy
with a case these days.

289
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:56,665
<i>That's okay.</i>

290
00:20:56,749 --> 00:20:59,210
No news is good news. There's still hope.

291
00:20:59,794 --> 00:21:01,754
Forget it. There's no hope left.

292
00:21:01,837 --> 00:21:03,923
Mi-jin, if you two are destined to meet,

293
00:21:04,006 --> 00:21:06,091
then you're bound to meet somehow.

294
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,344
Whatever, I'm going to drink
a bunch tonight

295
00:21:08,427 --> 00:21:09,512
and forget everything.

296
00:21:09,595 --> 00:21:11,639
Jeez, don't do anything stupid
while drunk again.

297
00:21:11,722 --> 00:21:12,973
Excuse me? Hey.

298
00:21:13,057 --> 00:21:15,434
What could I possibly do
at a pig's trotters restaurant?

299
00:21:15,518 --> 00:21:17,561
But where are you? I'm here.

300
00:21:18,062 --> 00:21:19,313
<i>Go ahead and get in line.</i>

301
00:21:19,396 --> 00:21:21,106
You're still not at home, are you?

302
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,108
I'm done editing. I'll be right there.

303
00:21:23,192 --> 00:21:25,277
Don't wait inside somewhere
because of the cold.

304
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:26,529
You have to wait in line.

305
00:21:26,612 --> 00:21:28,280
<i>It gets packed at night.</i>

306
00:21:28,364 --> 00:21:29,698
Okay. Just get here.

307
00:21:29,782 --> 00:21:30,783
<i>Okay.</i>

308
00:21:32,326 --> 00:21:33,410
I knew she'd do this.

309
00:21:34,078 --> 00:21:35,996
Why is this line so long?

310
00:21:43,003 --> 00:21:44,380
Ms. Lee Mi-jin?

311
00:21:47,007 --> 00:21:48,717
What are you doing here, Mr. Ju?

312
00:21:48,801 --> 00:21:50,344
I'm a regular here.

313
00:21:50,427 --> 00:21:51,637
I see.

314
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,389
Yes, this place is good.

315
00:21:53,472 --> 00:21:55,140
I see you're a regular too.

316
00:21:55,224 --> 00:21:57,101
Yes, my friend and I love this place.

317
00:21:57,184 --> 00:21:59,103
Your friend? But why are you alone?

318
00:21:59,186 --> 00:22:01,272
She's running late. She asked me to wait.

319
00:22:01,355 --> 00:22:04,108
- Great. You can join us then.
- "Us"?

320
00:22:04,191 --> 00:22:05,192
Just a moment.

321
00:22:07,027 --> 00:22:08,362
Hello? Where are you?

322
00:22:09,446 --> 00:22:12,116
How many times do I have to tell you?
Turn the corner.

323
00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:13,701
Yes.

324
00:22:13,784 --> 00:22:16,620
Mr. Gye, I know you'll just drink wine
on an empty stomach.

325
00:22:16,704 --> 00:22:20,291
In times like this, you eat something good
and relieve that stress.

326
00:22:20,374 --> 00:22:22,418
That'll increase your work efficiency.

327
00:22:22,501 --> 00:22:24,587
I've been running around in circles here!

328
00:22:28,924 --> 00:22:30,134
What are you doing here?

329
00:22:32,052 --> 00:22:32,886
Over here!

330
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,597
Come over this way!

331
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:49,612
<i>What happened?</i>

332
00:22:50,195 --> 00:22:52,239
<i>It's not what I wanted.</i>

333
00:22:53,907 --> 00:22:56,577
<i>What are you going to do
about this awkward situation?</i>

334
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,912
<i>I said this isn't what I wanted.</i>

335
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:03,959
You two must understand
each other with just a glance.

336
00:23:04,043 --> 00:23:04,960
- Yes.
- Yes.

337
00:23:05,711 --> 00:23:07,630
We grew up together.

338
00:23:07,713 --> 00:23:09,548
We're practically sisters.

339
00:23:09,632 --> 00:23:11,467
So your families must be close too.

340
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,635
- Yes.
- Of course.

341
00:23:12,718 --> 00:23:15,554
Mi-jin's parents
are like my second mom and dad.

342
00:23:15,638 --> 00:23:17,473
My mom passed away when I was young,

343
00:23:17,556 --> 00:23:20,559
so Mi-jin's mom packed
my lunch boxes on field trips,

344
00:23:20,643 --> 00:23:23,479
and she sends me kimchi
every year when she makes it.

345
00:23:24,063 --> 00:23:25,648
I see.

346
00:23:25,731 --> 00:23:27,524
- Yes.
- That's amazing.

347
00:23:28,942 --> 00:23:30,319
I wonder where the food is.

348
00:23:31,612 --> 00:23:33,739
- Help yourself to this.
- Thank you.

349
00:23:36,033 --> 00:23:37,034
Here you go.

350
00:23:37,117 --> 00:23:38,202
He offered it, so you eat.

351
00:23:38,285 --> 00:23:39,620
No, you eat it.

352
00:23:39,703 --> 00:23:40,829
- Stop it.
- No, you.

353
00:23:40,913 --> 00:23:41,997
I don't like these.

354
00:23:42,081 --> 00:23:43,957
- He gave it, so eat it.
- You eat it.

355
00:23:47,628 --> 00:23:49,546
- I'll pick it up.
- I'm so sorry.

356
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,298
- I'll clean it up.
- No, it's okay.

357
00:23:51,382 --> 00:23:52,966
- Hurry up, Mr. Gye.
- I'll do it.

358
00:23:58,555 --> 00:23:59,390
Are you okay?

359
00:23:59,473 --> 00:24:00,516
I'm fine.

360
00:24:01,392 --> 00:24:02,434
I said I'd do it.

361
00:24:22,037 --> 00:24:23,372
- Should we have a drink?
- Sure.

362
00:24:29,837 --> 00:24:31,505
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- No.

363
00:24:32,464 --> 00:24:33,882
I don't plan on having one.

364
00:24:34,591 --> 00:24:35,426
I see.

365
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:37,386
- Still, you must have a type.
- Ko Won.

366
00:24:39,596 --> 00:24:40,431
Ko Won?

367
00:24:40,514 --> 00:24:42,266
We'll clean it, so just leave it.

368
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:43,684
We've already cleaned up.

369
00:24:43,767 --> 00:24:45,102
Sorry for the mess.

370
00:24:45,185 --> 00:24:47,187
Why Ko Won of all people?

371
00:24:47,271 --> 00:24:48,147
What do you mean?

372
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,983
It's hard for any woman
not to like Ko Won.

373
00:24:51,817 --> 00:24:52,901
Do you agree, Mi-jin?

374
00:24:52,985 --> 00:24:54,695
- About what?
- Do you like Ko Won?

375
00:24:54,778 --> 00:24:56,071
She said all women do.

376
00:24:56,155 --> 00:24:57,948
Do I like Ko Won?

377
00:24:58,574 --> 00:25:00,701
I'd be thankful for someone like him.

378
00:25:00,784 --> 00:25:02,578
But of course, he'd turn me down.

379
00:25:02,661 --> 00:25:04,413
Yes, I'm sure.

380
00:25:04,496 --> 00:25:07,541
But if he did like you,
would you date him?

381
00:25:07,624 --> 00:25:08,459
If he liked me?

382
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:09,543
- There's no chance.
- No.

383
00:25:09,626 --> 00:25:10,586
This is so frustrating.

384
00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:11,879
What if…

385
00:25:11,962 --> 00:25:15,507
What if Ko Won
confesses that he likes you?

386
00:25:15,591 --> 00:25:17,968
Why are you asking hypothetical questions?

387
00:25:18,051 --> 00:25:19,261
There's no chance of it.

388
00:25:19,845 --> 00:25:21,054
I can ask.

389
00:25:21,138 --> 00:25:23,348
Asking "What if" is wrong in itself.

390
00:25:23,432 --> 00:25:26,310
Saying that would express
a very rare case!

391
00:25:26,393 --> 00:25:29,938
That didn't happen. Why can't you see
it's pointless to assume things

392
00:25:30,022 --> 00:25:31,648
and ask such questions?

393
00:25:31,732 --> 00:25:32,649
I have my reasons!

394
00:25:32,733 --> 00:25:34,193
It's just for fun!

395
00:25:34,276 --> 00:25:36,612
How is this fun? What's fun about it?

396
00:25:36,695 --> 00:25:39,031
- Is this fun?
- It's so much fun.

397
00:25:47,289 --> 00:25:48,373
Another beer, please!

398
00:25:51,877 --> 00:25:53,128
You said you weren't drinking.

399
00:25:53,212 --> 00:25:55,839
- I'll call a designated driver.
- Yeah, answer him.

400
00:25:55,923 --> 00:25:58,342
Would you go out with Ko Won if he asked?

401
00:25:58,425 --> 00:26:01,261
What's wrong with you?
Why would he ask me out?

402
00:26:01,345 --> 00:26:02,638
It's a hypothetical.

403
00:26:03,388 --> 00:26:04,389
Did she not hear me?

404
00:26:04,473 --> 00:26:05,682
We ordered a beer here!

405
00:26:05,766 --> 00:26:06,600
All right!

406
00:26:06,683 --> 00:26:09,269
I'll be generous enough
to let you have him.

407
00:26:09,353 --> 00:26:10,270
Tell us the truth.

408
00:26:10,354 --> 00:26:12,481
- Why would you do that?
- No reason.

409
00:26:12,564 --> 00:26:15,067
At the very slightest chance

410
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:18,195
Ko Won said that he liked me…

411
00:26:22,324 --> 00:26:24,409
Your extra-large
spicy pig's trotters and beer.

412
00:26:24,493 --> 00:26:25,953
- Thank you!
- Here's the beer.

413
00:26:26,036 --> 00:26:27,496
- Thank you.
- Let's eat first.

414
00:26:27,579 --> 00:26:28,413
This looks good.

415
00:26:28,497 --> 00:26:29,623
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

416
00:26:29,706 --> 00:26:31,166
She stopped mid-sentence…

417
00:26:32,251 --> 00:26:33,085
It's so good!

418
00:26:33,168 --> 00:26:34,628
That's not important. Look.

419
00:26:34,711 --> 00:26:35,879
I don't want it!

420
00:26:37,631 --> 00:26:39,383
It's better when you eat it here.

421
00:26:42,761 --> 00:26:45,556
- Snap out of it, will you?
- Get it together!

422
00:26:45,639 --> 00:26:48,183
You said you'd help
ease my stress, not add to it.

423
00:26:48,267 --> 00:26:49,810
If we have one more drink…

424
00:26:49,893 --> 00:26:52,813
What are you talking about?
You're totally drunk.

425
00:26:53,522 --> 00:26:54,815
Ouch!

426
00:26:54,898 --> 00:26:56,358
- Be careful.
- I'm so dizzy.

427
00:26:56,441 --> 00:26:58,527
- Jeez.
- Let's rest a bit before we go.

428
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:01,280
I wanted to stay home,
but he just had to drag me out.

429
00:27:01,864 --> 00:27:03,448
Sorry about joining you two.

430
00:27:03,532 --> 00:27:06,034
No, that's not what I meant.

431
00:27:07,953 --> 00:27:10,497
Mr. Ju was happy to see you earlier.

432
00:27:11,164 --> 00:27:14,459
Yeah, it was nice seeing him outside
even though I see him every day.

433
00:27:15,127 --> 00:27:16,670
When did we see each other?

434
00:27:17,129 --> 00:27:18,255
You see him every day?

435
00:27:18,338 --> 00:27:19,298
Where?

436
00:27:19,965 --> 00:27:21,341
Well…

437
00:27:21,425 --> 00:27:22,509
going here and there,

438
00:27:23,468 --> 00:27:25,554
I've seen him around a lot.

439
00:27:25,637 --> 00:27:27,848
Then, you should've said hi!

440
00:27:27,931 --> 00:27:29,725
Let's get another drink! Excuse me!

441
00:27:29,808 --> 00:27:31,268
Table for four right here!

442
00:27:31,351 --> 00:27:32,895
- They're closed.
- Four's good!

443
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,731
- Hello?
- Get up. They're closed. Leave it.

444
00:27:36,481 --> 00:27:37,941
Hey, over here!

445
00:27:38,025 --> 00:27:38,942
- They're closed?
- Jeez.

446
00:27:39,026 --> 00:27:41,278
- Let's get one more drink!
- Stop it.

447
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:43,989
- Can you carry me on your back?
- One more!

448
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,706
Why is this so tight?

449
00:27:52,789 --> 00:27:54,291
It's too tight!

450
00:27:54,374 --> 00:27:56,209
How could she do this to us?

451
00:27:56,293 --> 00:27:59,421
I asked for a table for four,
and she didn't open the door.

452
00:27:59,504 --> 00:28:00,714
This can't happen…

453
00:28:00,797 --> 00:28:02,966
- Who are you?
- Your designated driver.

454
00:28:03,884 --> 00:28:05,052
Where's Mr. Gye?

455
00:28:05,135 --> 00:28:06,345
- In the back.
- I'm here!

456
00:28:06,428 --> 00:28:07,971
Gosh, you scared me.

457
00:28:08,055 --> 00:28:09,723
You always do this when you're drunk.

458
00:28:09,806 --> 00:28:10,974
I don't feel well.

459
00:28:11,058 --> 00:28:12,643
- Hey!
- I feel nauseous.

460
00:28:12,726 --> 00:28:14,853
- Stay on your side.
- I feel so sick.

461
00:28:14,937 --> 00:28:16,563
I'm fine. Make yourself comfortable.

462
00:28:16,647 --> 00:28:18,857
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry.

463
00:28:19,858 --> 00:28:21,818
I said go back to your side.

464
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,198
But I still haven't heard your answer.

465
00:28:27,199 --> 00:28:28,033
About what?

466
00:28:28,116 --> 00:28:29,868
About what Mr. Ju asked you before.

467
00:28:33,413 --> 00:28:34,665
Will you get off me?

468
00:28:39,836 --> 00:28:41,713
I think I already answered it though.

469
00:28:43,465 --> 00:28:44,299
When?

470
00:28:46,635 --> 00:28:47,511
That night.

471
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,474
- Then, this isn't an accident.
- What isn't an accident?

472
00:29:01,525 --> 00:29:03,193
Mi-jin, about that--

473
00:29:03,277 --> 00:29:04,486
We've almost arrived.

474
00:29:04,569 --> 00:29:05,779
- Okay.
- Okay.

475
00:29:05,862 --> 00:29:08,198
The pho restaurant? We're here?

476
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:14,329
- I love pho.
- You're a great guy.

477
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:19,418
Careful.

478
00:29:25,882 --> 00:29:27,426
- I'll be going now.
- Okay.

479
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:34,891
Take care.

480
00:29:34,975 --> 00:29:35,976
You too.

481
00:29:37,978 --> 00:29:38,812
By the way…

482
00:29:40,355 --> 00:29:42,107
what were you going to say earlier?

483
00:29:47,738 --> 00:29:48,739
I'll call you.

484
00:29:49,865 --> 00:29:50,866
Okay.

485
00:29:57,664 --> 00:29:59,916
When is he going to call?

486
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,085
- Do you think he'll ask you out?
- My goodness.

487
00:30:03,253 --> 00:30:04,755
I knew it.

488
00:30:04,838 --> 00:30:06,840
You two were so inseparable.

489
00:30:09,468 --> 00:30:10,635
Weren't you drunk?

490
00:30:12,137 --> 00:30:14,139
Jeez. Come on.

491
00:30:14,222 --> 00:30:15,599
Snap out of it, will you?

492
00:30:16,892 --> 00:30:18,310
Get it together!

493
00:30:21,646 --> 00:30:22,689
Pull it together.

494
00:30:22,773 --> 00:30:24,816
An investigator shouldn't drink so much.

495
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,276
Thank you for driving, sir.

496
00:30:28,195 --> 00:30:30,113
Gosh, so nice and warm.

497
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:32,574
Get up. Not there.

498
00:30:32,657 --> 00:30:33,784
Sleep anywhere on the couch.

499
00:30:33,867 --> 00:30:35,911
Then, how about we…

500
00:30:36,703 --> 00:30:38,080
have a little pho?

501
00:30:38,163 --> 00:30:39,831
- Okay?
- In your next life.

502
00:30:41,917 --> 00:30:42,918
Jeez.

503
00:30:44,211 --> 00:30:47,798
I'd like to order a large size.

504
00:30:50,092 --> 00:30:51,259
Make it spicy, please.

505
00:30:51,676 --> 00:30:53,220
Goodness gracious.

506
00:31:42,232 --> 00:31:43,400
Good grief.

507
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,111
Look at this.

508
00:31:46,653 --> 00:31:49,073
The prosecutor ended up
causing trouble again.

509
00:31:49,156 --> 00:31:51,158
- Please stay back.
- What do you mean?

510
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:55,954
Whenever he catches onto something,
he keeps showing up like a hyena.

511
00:31:56,538 --> 00:31:59,083
Still, we found the body thanks to him.

512
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:01,293
"Thanks to him"?

513
00:32:01,376 --> 00:32:03,087
He's not why we found it, punk!

514
00:32:03,712 --> 00:32:05,172
It just happened to surface.

515
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,717
Gosh, it's deteriorated a lot.

516
00:32:09,426 --> 00:32:11,095
Goodness, is it someone we know?

517
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,805
What are you saying?

518
00:32:13,347 --> 00:32:14,473
That's enough!

519
00:32:14,556 --> 00:32:15,849
Fine, let's wrap it up!

520
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,184
Go!

521
00:32:17,267 --> 00:32:18,102
Just go.

522
00:32:18,185 --> 00:32:19,019
Goodness.

523
00:32:23,273 --> 00:32:26,652
- It was caught in the water weeds.
- That makes bodies hard to find.

524
00:32:30,155 --> 00:32:31,198
- Hey, watch the line!
- Dad!

525
00:32:31,281 --> 00:32:32,866
- Dad!
- Stop her!

526
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,159
- Stop her!
- Dad!

527
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:36,995
- Please, calm down!
- Dad! This can't be!

528
00:32:37,496 --> 00:32:38,664
Hey, keep her back.

529
00:32:38,747 --> 00:32:41,041
- Please calm down.
- Dad, get up! Let me go!

530
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,544
Please calm down. All right.

531
00:32:43,627 --> 00:32:45,087
Dad!

532
00:32:46,088 --> 00:32:47,131
Dad!

533
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,007
Dad!

534
00:32:49,091 --> 00:32:52,177
- Hey, keep her away!
- Wait. Dad!

535
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:56,431
Dad!

536
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:08,443
- Hey, secure the scene inside!
- Mom!

537
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:12,030
Mom!

538
00:33:12,114 --> 00:33:13,991
What's going on?

539
00:33:16,076 --> 00:33:17,035
What happened?

540
00:33:17,703 --> 00:33:18,704
It's a body!

541
00:33:18,787 --> 00:33:21,206
- Mom!
- My gosh!

542
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,333
Mom!

543
00:33:34,052 --> 00:33:35,429
Who let the kid in?

544
00:33:35,512 --> 00:33:37,431
- Get rid of him now!
- Just go!

545
00:33:37,514 --> 00:33:39,683
- What about my mom?
- Ji-ung, it's not your mom.

546
00:33:39,766 --> 00:33:43,187
- She's not your mom! Get him out of here!
- Please find her!

547
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:46,231
- Now!
<i>- She's gone missing too!</i>

548
00:33:54,823 --> 00:33:56,283
Goodness.

549
00:33:57,451 --> 00:33:58,744
What about my mom?

550
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,914
Where is she?

551
00:34:01,997 --> 00:34:04,499
Please find my mom.

552
00:34:05,709 --> 00:34:06,919
Have you eaten anything?

553
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:11,006
Here.

554
00:34:12,382 --> 00:34:13,467
Buy something to eat.

555
00:34:14,384 --> 00:34:15,844
Goodness.

556
00:34:22,184 --> 00:34:24,061
Gosh, it's cold out here!

557
00:34:24,144 --> 00:34:26,521
Don't you know you'll catch a cold?

558
00:34:29,775 --> 00:34:32,069
Go home now, okay?

559
00:34:32,152 --> 00:34:34,738
I won't leave until you find my mom.

560
00:34:34,821 --> 00:34:36,990
It's not that we're not looking for her.

561
00:34:37,574 --> 00:34:40,327
We tried really hard,

562
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:43,038
but we couldn't find her.

563
00:34:45,123 --> 00:34:47,042
My mom's alive.

564
00:34:48,585 --> 00:34:50,879
She made me a promise.

565
00:34:52,464 --> 00:34:53,924
She said she'd come back.

566
00:34:56,134 --> 00:34:57,135
Okay.

567
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:00,430
I hope

568
00:35:01,765 --> 00:35:03,642
that's the case too.

569
00:35:03,725 --> 00:35:05,686
She'll be back if she's alive.

570
00:35:23,328 --> 00:35:24,913
Dad!

571
00:35:26,748 --> 00:35:27,666
Dad!

572
00:35:29,835 --> 00:35:32,421
Dad!

573
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,134
Ms. Lim.

574
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,553
- If you have time for dinner--
- No.

575
00:36:21,636 --> 00:36:23,263
No, let's have pig's trotters and soju<i>--</i>

576
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,264
- No.
- No?

577
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,183
Then, there's this great crab place.

578
00:36:26,266 --> 00:36:27,142
It's on me.

579
00:36:27,225 --> 00:36:28,894
Work's over, so I'll be going.

580
00:36:29,936 --> 00:36:30,937
See you tomorrow.

581
00:36:52,334 --> 00:36:53,168
Hey, Sun.

582
00:36:53,251 --> 00:36:55,212
- What?
- I'll give you a ride.

583
00:36:59,925 --> 00:37:01,718
No, it's rush hour. My bike's faster.

584
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:04,137
And if you overexert yourself
and break a bone?

585
00:37:04,221 --> 00:37:05,639
I said it's fine.

586
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:07,391
It's not fine with me.

587
00:37:09,226 --> 00:37:11,436
Hey, what if people see us?

588
00:37:11,978 --> 00:37:13,563
What's so important about that?

589
00:37:13,647 --> 00:37:15,565
Your safety's more important.

590
00:37:15,649 --> 00:37:17,275
- What's with you today?
- Give it.

591
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,361
- Let's go.
- What's gotten into you?

592
00:37:19,444 --> 00:37:20,320
Let's go.

593
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,988
- Come on.
- Get in.

594
00:37:22,072 --> 00:37:23,698
- Come on, let's go.
- Hey.

595
00:37:23,782 --> 00:37:24,658
- Let's go.
- Wait.

596
00:37:24,741 --> 00:37:25,826
Come on, let's go.

597
00:37:25,909 --> 00:37:27,702
- Ms. Lim.
- What's with you?

598
00:37:27,786 --> 00:37:29,371
See? I knew you'd get in.

599
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,289
Watch your head.

600
00:37:31,873 --> 00:37:34,251
Don't get in. Please.

601
00:37:34,334 --> 00:37:35,544
Let's put on your belt.

602
00:37:47,931 --> 00:37:50,392
- Don't speak informally to me in public.
- Come on.

603
00:38:24,009 --> 00:38:25,510
Hey, this isn't the way home.

604
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,387
I haven't bought you some good food yet.

605
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,472
Let's have dinner.

606
00:38:29,097 --> 00:38:30,807
Why do you do as you please?

607
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,476
Who said I wanted dinner?

608
00:38:32,934 --> 00:38:35,812
I just felt bad about what happened
at the company dinner.

609
00:38:38,773 --> 00:38:40,567
If it weren't for him…

610
00:38:47,657 --> 00:38:48,575
<i>Are you okay?</i>

611
00:38:48,658 --> 00:38:49,743
I said I'd do it.

612
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,542
By the way…

613
00:38:59,085 --> 00:39:00,962
what were you going to say earlier?

614
00:39:02,172 --> 00:39:03,256
I'll call you.

615
00:39:09,804 --> 00:39:11,097
Is something wrong?

616
00:39:13,016 --> 00:39:15,769
Nothing's wrong at all.
Everything is fine.

617
00:39:27,489 --> 00:39:29,616
But please don't do that.

618
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:31,409
Back there…

619
00:39:31,493 --> 00:39:32,994
Damn it.

620
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,372
Who called them?

621
00:39:35,455 --> 00:39:37,207
Did the prosecutors leak this?

622
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:39,376
I bet they're trying to screw us over.

623
00:39:39,459 --> 00:39:42,546
Come on. Mr. Gye wouldn't do that.

624
00:39:42,629 --> 00:39:44,047
Yeah, right.

625
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:46,299
He requested a warrant
as soon as he got the case!

626
00:39:46,383 --> 00:39:50,178
He's making a damn fuss
searching for the body and the culprit.

627
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,848
This is driving me nuts.

628
00:39:56,184 --> 00:39:58,603
- Someone's coming!
- How's the case going?

629
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:01,314
A foot was found last month.
Why was the corpse found now?

630
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:03,942
Did police mishandling
the investigation cause the delay?

631
00:40:04,025 --> 00:40:07,696
Is it true the foot was severed
while the victim was alive?

632
00:40:07,779 --> 00:40:10,782
If it was a murder,
could there be more victims?

633
00:40:11,825 --> 00:40:13,034
What is your position?

634
00:40:13,118 --> 00:40:14,578
- Tell us!
- I'm on my way.

635
00:40:14,661 --> 00:40:16,204
- Is it true?
- I'll see you at NFS.

636
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:17,914
Did you mishandle the investigation?

637
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,416
- Do you admit it?
- Tell us.

638
00:40:19,499 --> 00:40:21,126
- Give us a statement.
- Tell us!

639
00:40:21,209 --> 00:40:22,711
- A few words, please.
- Come on!

640
00:40:22,794 --> 00:40:24,045
<i>A male body with a missing foot</i>

641
00:40:24,129 --> 00:40:26,840
<i>was found in a reservoir in Seohan City.</i>

642
00:40:26,923 --> 00:40:30,468
<i>It's been confirmed
the victim was a male in his sixties.</i>

643
00:40:30,552 --> 00:40:34,598
<i>Despite finding a severed foot
near the reservoir last month,</i>

644
00:40:34,681 --> 00:40:37,684
<i>there are claims that the body
wasn't found for over a month</i>

645
00:40:37,767 --> 00:40:40,520
<i>due to police
mishandling the investigation…</i>

NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE
DIRECTOR CHOI

647
00:40:47,694 --> 00:40:49,195
Hello, Director Choi. It's me.

648
00:40:50,113 --> 00:40:51,656
I have something to ask you.

649
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,741
Yes.

650
00:40:53,575 --> 00:40:55,076
Could I see you for a moment?

651
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,870
I understand. Goodbye.

652
00:41:02,667 --> 00:41:04,294
BODY WITH MISSING FOOT
FOUND IN RESERVOIR

653
00:41:04,377 --> 00:41:05,587
POLICE SUSPECTED OF NEGLIGENCE

654
00:41:12,302 --> 00:41:13,553
You said you could do it.

655
00:41:15,263 --> 00:41:16,973
You said I could leave it to you.

656
00:41:18,433 --> 00:41:20,894
The police searched for days
and couldn't find it.

657
00:41:20,977 --> 00:41:22,854
I don't think that's on us.

658
00:41:22,937 --> 00:41:24,064
"Us"?

659
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:26,900
This is on you!

660
00:41:26,983 --> 00:41:29,110
Gye found what even the police couldn't!

661
00:41:29,194 --> 00:41:31,279
This wasn't even his case!
What were you doing?

662
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,989
- Mr. Cha.
- Forget it!

663
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:35,325
Anyways, the case
has gone to Gye. It's final.

664
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,038
- Mr. Cha!
- Enough!

665
00:41:40,121 --> 00:41:41,665
- Mr. Cha!
- Go away!

666
00:41:45,502 --> 00:41:46,628
Gye Ji-ung!

667
00:41:49,214 --> 00:41:51,007
I'm going to kill him.

668
00:41:52,217 --> 00:41:53,259
Damn it.

669
00:41:56,221 --> 00:41:57,555
Gye Ji-ung!

670
00:42:04,062 --> 00:42:05,438
I'm so scared.

671
00:42:05,522 --> 00:42:06,690
She's so scary.

672
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,282
Mr. Ju, are you okay?

673
00:42:16,366 --> 00:42:19,994
I'd already been feeling upset.
Now, it's one thing after another.

674
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:22,038
Are you really okay?

675
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:25,625
The emperor has donkey ears!

676
00:42:30,004 --> 00:42:33,800
Saying things that shouldn't be said
is absolutely unacceptable.

677
00:42:33,883 --> 00:42:35,719
For your own good,

678
00:42:36,928 --> 00:42:38,221
I absolutely cannot say.

679
00:42:38,304 --> 00:42:39,597
I won't!

680
00:42:39,681 --> 00:42:40,974
I won't tell you.

681
00:42:54,028 --> 00:42:57,741
Wow, I guess Mr. Ju
is seriously stressed out.

682
00:42:58,658 --> 00:43:00,410
I should work harder for him.

683
00:43:00,493 --> 00:43:01,536
I can't believe it.

684
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:03,121
- My goodness.
- Hello.

685
00:43:03,204 --> 00:43:05,373
- How could it happen? Hi.
- Hello. Did you see this?

686
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:07,876
- What is it?
- He was a custodian here named Ko Na-heun.

687
00:43:07,959 --> 00:43:08,793
Really?

688
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:12,422
The police mishandled
the investigation. It's terrible.

689
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:19,888
BODY WITH MISSING FOOT
FOUND IN RESERVOIR

690
00:43:28,855 --> 00:43:29,981
<i>My dad…</i>

691
00:43:30,064 --> 00:43:32,942
<i>He took care of me for over 20 years
with his injured leg.</i>

692
00:43:33,026 --> 00:43:36,029
He always made sure
I never ate dinner alone.

693
00:43:36,654 --> 00:43:38,406
He said he wasn't a good enough father,

694
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,074
so he couldn't do anything for me.

695
00:43:40,158 --> 00:43:43,453
He'd always personally prepare
dinner for me.

NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

697
00:43:58,176 --> 00:43:59,886
- Mr. Gye.
- Hello.

698
00:43:59,969 --> 00:44:01,930
I would've called you when it was done.

699
00:44:02,013 --> 00:44:04,599
- How much longer for the autopsy?
- We made an urgent request.

700
00:44:04,682 --> 00:44:06,518
It'll be over within the hour.

SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

703
00:44:21,741 --> 00:44:22,700
Goodness.

704
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:27,038
I'm sure you've all seen
the news about Ko Na-heun.

705
00:44:27,121 --> 00:44:28,957
They're still doing the autopsy.

706
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,960
Even if we can't hold
a memorial service right away,

707
00:44:32,043 --> 00:44:34,963
let's remember he was a colleague of ours

708
00:44:35,046 --> 00:44:36,965
who we shared ups and downs with.

709
00:44:37,048 --> 00:44:38,591
Right?

710
00:44:38,675 --> 00:44:40,760
We only worked together for a few days.

711
00:44:40,843 --> 00:44:42,220
You're so rude.

712
00:44:42,303 --> 00:44:43,888
Just listen to yourself!

713
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:47,475
What, am I wrong? It's true.

714
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:51,854
Ko Na-heun's daughter stood outside
and begged for someone to find her dad.

715
00:44:51,938 --> 00:44:53,690
Did anyone here try to help?

716
00:44:53,773 --> 00:44:55,692
Come on, now.

717
00:44:55,775 --> 00:44:58,194
- We were getting to know each other--
- He's dead now.

718
00:44:58,278 --> 00:44:59,279
Come on!

719
00:44:59,362 --> 00:45:01,447
Is that the only way you can speak?

720
00:45:01,531 --> 00:45:03,408
What if you'd died like that?

721
00:45:03,491 --> 00:45:06,911
- Think about your family!
- Did I kill him? Why take it out on me?

722
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:08,997
Just thinking about it is making me mad!

723
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,291
I need some tea. Good grief!

724
00:45:11,374 --> 00:45:13,001
That's enough.

725
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,796
Nothing good can come
from us acting this way.

726
00:45:16,879 --> 00:45:18,923
Yeah, he's right. Okay?

727
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:20,174
At times like this,

728
00:45:20,258 --> 00:45:23,386
we should keep a low profile
and stay quiet

729
00:45:23,469 --> 00:45:25,680
to avoid any unwanted attention.

730
00:45:25,763 --> 00:45:29,392
Also, let's all chip in some money

731
00:45:29,475 --> 00:45:31,853
and provide some condolence money, okay?

732
00:45:32,437 --> 00:45:33,730
That's all.

733
00:45:33,813 --> 00:45:36,149
I'm in favor.

734
00:45:36,691 --> 00:45:38,151
I'll help too.

735
00:45:38,776 --> 00:45:40,862
If something happens
to his daughter's health,

736
00:45:40,945 --> 00:45:43,156
my hospital will actively support her.

737
00:46:08,264 --> 00:46:11,601
Mr. Baek!

738
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:21,027
NUMBER 81D 6438

739
00:46:27,241 --> 00:46:28,368
Ms. Lee Mi-jin!

740
00:46:37,126 --> 00:46:40,838
Could you look for an SUV registered
in Seohan City with the number 6438?

741
00:46:42,048 --> 00:46:43,466
<i>Didn't you say the director</i>

742
00:46:43,549 --> 00:46:45,468
of Hwadong Medical Center
works here?

743
00:46:45,551 --> 00:46:46,761
Yes, Director Baek Cheol-gyu.

744
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,763
How long has he worked here now?

745
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:03,444
The owner of car 6438!

746
00:47:03,528 --> 00:47:07,448
The owner of 6438 is Dr. Baek.

747
00:47:10,201 --> 00:47:12,078
Baek Cheol-gyu is car 6438!

748
00:47:12,161 --> 00:47:13,746
Ms. Lim, calm down.

749
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:16,749
He's on a list of suspects
and is being investigated.

750
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:17,667
Then…

751
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:21,129
Are you saying the person

752
00:47:21,212 --> 00:47:23,464
who killed Ko Na-heun could be Dr. Baek?

753
00:47:23,548 --> 00:47:25,174
We're not sure of anything yet.

754
00:47:25,967 --> 00:47:27,969
Of course, Mr. Gye is almost certain.

755
00:47:31,222 --> 00:47:33,558
Then, why haven't you caught him yet?

756
00:47:35,017 --> 00:47:37,228
You have to arrest him
and lock him up now!

757
00:47:37,311 --> 00:47:39,188
There's no proof yet.

758
00:47:39,272 --> 00:47:42,859
Mr. Gye wasn't in charge of the case then.
Building a case has its limits too.

759
00:47:42,942 --> 00:47:46,612
What if he kills someone else
in the meantime?

760
00:47:48,573 --> 00:47:51,951
Witness… A witness!

761
00:47:52,034 --> 00:47:53,953
A witness? Who's the witness?

762
00:47:54,036 --> 00:47:56,831
Well, that's…

763
00:47:57,415 --> 00:47:59,208
If that case…

764
00:48:00,835 --> 00:48:03,171
The person who saw the culprit.
The witness.

765
00:48:03,254 --> 00:48:04,422
What do we do?

766
00:48:04,505 --> 00:48:06,758
What proof would we need? What evidence?

767
00:48:06,841 --> 00:48:08,009
Let's think rationally.

768
00:48:08,926 --> 00:48:10,386
Right here. The two of us.

769
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,389
Let's go find the evidence together.
Let's find something.

770
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:14,974
- Okay?
- Ms. Lim!

771
00:48:15,057 --> 00:48:17,310
After the autopsy
and after we get a warrant--

772
00:48:20,271 --> 00:48:21,647
Ms. Lim, are you okay?

773
00:48:21,731 --> 00:48:23,191
- The thing is--
- Take a seat.

774
00:48:34,089 --> 00:48:35,132
What did you find?

775
00:48:35,215 --> 00:48:36,967
The cause of death

776
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:39,511
was asphyxiation
due to the inhalation of water.

777
00:48:41,972 --> 00:48:43,890
So he wasn't submerged after death.

778
00:48:43,974 --> 00:48:45,559
Are you saying he drowned?

779
00:48:45,642 --> 00:48:47,436
Yes, the victim's organs

780
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:49,855
contained a large amount
of plankton and sand.

781
00:48:49,938 --> 00:48:52,274
It was inhaled from the water he was in.

782
00:48:57,321 --> 00:49:00,449
So his foot was severed
and he was submerged

783
00:49:00,532 --> 00:49:02,117
while he was still alive?

784
00:49:06,955 --> 00:49:08,582
What a damn psycho.

785
00:49:08,665 --> 00:49:10,500
Did he have any other injuries?

786
00:49:10,584 --> 00:49:13,712
There are some scratches on the body.

787
00:49:13,795 --> 00:49:17,257
I don't think he got them
from the rocks in the water.

788
00:49:17,341 --> 00:49:20,218
He likely got scraped when the culprit
dragged him on the ground.

789
00:49:20,302 --> 00:49:21,303
What the hell?

790
00:49:21,386 --> 00:49:22,763
You have to be kidding me.

791
00:49:22,846 --> 00:49:24,348
Anything else to report?

792
00:49:24,431 --> 00:49:27,517
Right. Fentanyl was found in his blood.

793
00:49:27,601 --> 00:49:30,979
Even just two milligrams
of fentanyl can be lethal.

794
00:49:31,063 --> 00:49:33,857
The amount detected wasn't a lethal dose,

795
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,734
but he was probably unconscious.

796
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:40,822
If the culprit had administered it,

797
00:49:40,906 --> 00:49:44,660
it may be someone with specialized skills
who knows how to control dosages.

798
00:49:44,743 --> 00:49:45,744
Probably so.

799
00:49:45,827 --> 00:49:50,916
Also, even though it was a minimal amount,
opium was found as well.

800
00:49:51,041 --> 00:49:53,585
Once we get the detailed report,
I'll send it over.

801
00:49:56,463 --> 00:49:57,589
- Mr. Gye.
- Yes?

802
00:49:57,673 --> 00:49:58,757
I have to go.

803
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,300
- Okay, great work.
- Thanks.

804
00:50:01,009 --> 00:50:03,720
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

805
00:50:08,517 --> 00:50:09,810
- Hello?
<i>- Mr. Gye.</i>

806
00:50:09,893 --> 00:50:13,021
<i>The search and seizure warrant
for Hwadong Medical Center was rejected.</i>

807
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:14,690
What?

808
00:50:19,444 --> 00:50:21,655
- What is it?
- I should ask you. What is this?

809
00:50:21,738 --> 00:50:23,031
Why was the warrant rejected?

810
00:50:23,115 --> 00:50:24,700
Am I the one who rejected it?

811
00:50:25,367 --> 00:50:26,910
It deserved to be rejected--

812
00:50:26,993 --> 00:50:30,038
Don't you know Dr. Baek
was a suspect in his wife's death?

813
00:50:31,373 --> 00:50:32,457
Come on.

814
00:50:33,208 --> 00:50:34,710
Don't you know who he is?

815
00:50:34,793 --> 00:50:36,837
I do. He's a prime suspect.

816
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,463
Hey, seriously?

817
00:50:38,547 --> 00:50:41,466
Director Baek was cleared
of charges in the past. Remember?

818
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:43,969
Also, there are all sorts
of drugs at a hospital.

819
00:50:44,052 --> 00:50:45,804
Why would fentanyl be a problem?

820
00:50:47,597 --> 00:50:48,598
So the thing is,

821
00:50:49,182 --> 00:50:53,103
fentanyl was found in his wife's body
and in Ko Na-heun's body.

822
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,814
You are being so uptight.

823
00:50:55,897 --> 00:50:59,192
Do you have proof the fentanyl
came from Hwadong Medical Center?

824
00:50:59,776 --> 00:51:01,570
That's why I need a search warrant.

825
00:51:01,653 --> 00:51:04,322
For goodness' sake!
Why come to me and complain?

826
00:51:04,406 --> 00:51:06,032
Take it up with the judge!

827
00:51:10,954 --> 00:51:12,748
<i>Let's dig into Baek Cheol-gyu.</i>

828
00:51:16,585 --> 00:51:18,003
What is it? What's wrong?

829
00:51:19,421 --> 00:51:21,673
Mr. Gye has
three different warning levels.

830
00:51:21,757 --> 00:51:22,883
What are they?

831
00:51:22,966 --> 00:51:24,926
He gets immersed in work
and becomes a jerk.

832
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:27,179
Ignorant. Irresponsible.
Lacks common sense.

833
00:51:27,262 --> 00:51:28,805
I'll correct that.
Totally thoughtless.

834
00:51:30,974 --> 00:51:31,850
What's level two?

835
00:51:31,933 --> 00:51:34,728
He becomes a jerk
and loses his humanity too.

836
00:51:34,811 --> 00:51:36,188
Is that all you know?

837
00:51:36,938 --> 00:51:37,814
I'm sorry.

838
00:51:37,898 --> 00:51:39,941
<i>This is why I don't like
working with people</i>

839
00:51:40,025 --> 00:51:41,985
who are old, inexperienced, and chatty.

840
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:46,239
Then, what about level three?

841
00:51:46,323 --> 00:51:48,200
He just goes crazy
and doesn't hold back.

842
00:51:48,283 --> 00:51:49,493
He charges ahead recklessly.

843
00:51:50,452 --> 00:51:52,078
Then, what level is at he now?

844
00:51:52,162 --> 00:51:54,122
He's probably at level two right now.

845
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:00,045
We're going to Hwadong Medical Center now.

846
00:52:02,714 --> 00:52:04,090
It's level three now.

847
00:52:06,885 --> 00:52:08,970
Then, what happens now?

848
00:52:11,264 --> 00:52:13,225
My stomach!

849
00:52:13,308 --> 00:52:14,684
- Someone help me!
- Honey!

850
00:52:14,768 --> 00:52:15,894
- Where do we go?
- Gosh!

851
00:52:15,977 --> 00:52:18,772
- Where? My gosh!
- I'm dying! Help me!

852
00:52:31,827 --> 00:52:32,661
Let's start.

853
00:52:32,744 --> 00:52:33,578
Okay.

854
00:52:37,707 --> 00:52:39,084
I won't miss out this time.

855
00:52:39,167 --> 00:52:41,795
You'll have to trample over me
if you want to go without me.

856
00:52:42,337 --> 00:52:43,463
It's do or die for me.

857
00:52:46,174 --> 00:52:48,093
Why are you suddenly so spirited?

858
00:52:48,802 --> 00:52:51,680
- Let's go.
- Seriously?

859
00:52:52,556 --> 00:52:54,683
My life's on the line!

860
00:52:55,308 --> 00:52:56,184
What do you mean?

861
00:53:01,273 --> 00:53:03,567
My… survival.

862
00:53:05,986 --> 00:53:08,905
I have to earn my keep to survive.

863
00:53:26,882 --> 00:53:27,757
Let's go.

864
00:53:35,682 --> 00:53:40,020
WARD A
A GENERAL WARD

865
00:53:55,118 --> 00:53:58,705
Aside from working here, the hospital is
the only other place Baek goes.

866
00:53:58,788 --> 00:54:00,498
I'm sure we'll find something there.

867
00:54:01,082 --> 00:54:03,710
We don't have time or the manpower.
It won't be easy.

868
00:54:04,753 --> 00:54:07,422
Mr. Ju, you take
the medicine storage room here.

869
00:54:07,505 --> 00:54:09,716
I'll take the basement storage.

870
00:54:09,799 --> 00:54:10,675
Yes, sir.

871
00:54:10,759 --> 00:54:13,261
Baek likely knows
we requested a search warrant.

872
00:54:13,345 --> 00:54:16,640
We must find any potential evidence
before it's hidden.

873
00:54:16,723 --> 00:54:19,768
Then… where do I go?

874
00:54:30,403 --> 00:54:32,197
EMERGENCY PATIENTS ONLY

875
00:54:53,718 --> 00:54:54,719
Ms. Lim Sun?

876
00:54:55,428 --> 00:54:57,347
Ms. Lim, where are you going?

877
00:54:58,682 --> 00:55:00,517
My goodness.

878
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,310
- Are you okay?
- I'm so dizzy.

879
00:55:02,394 --> 00:55:04,145
- My stomach hurts.
- Let's go inside.

880
00:55:04,229 --> 00:55:06,106
My head and my stomach hurt.

881
00:55:06,189 --> 00:55:07,607
You can't come out here.

882
00:55:07,691 --> 00:55:09,484
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.

883
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:11,987
It was just so stuffy in there.

884
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:13,697
We still have to draw blood.

885
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:14,906
Wait, to draw blood…

886
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:16,032
Draw blood?

887
00:55:16,574 --> 00:55:18,243
It's a simple test. Let's go in.

888
00:55:18,326 --> 00:55:20,036
No, it's not that simple.

889
00:55:20,662 --> 00:55:23,748
You can't be out here.
Why are you so strong?

890
00:55:27,669 --> 00:55:30,255
Lim Sun's at the hospital? Are you sure?

891
00:55:30,338 --> 00:55:31,840
Hold her there no matter what!

892
00:55:52,986 --> 00:55:55,321
Make a fist. This will sting a little.

893
00:55:55,405 --> 00:55:58,616
I'm really scared of needles though.

894
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,827
Can you please do it gently?

895
00:56:05,915 --> 00:56:07,459
I haven't done it yet.

896
00:56:09,753 --> 00:56:11,421
What tests do you need to run?

897
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,814
- Where's Lim Sun?
- Bed six.

898
00:56:35,153 --> 00:56:36,863
What did I say? I told you to watch her!

899
00:56:36,946 --> 00:56:38,740
She was just here moments ago.

900
00:56:38,823 --> 00:56:41,242
Find her right now. Call security!

901
00:56:50,752 --> 00:56:53,755
FIVE MINUTES EARLIER

902
00:57:09,854 --> 00:57:11,064
What are we going to do?

903
00:57:27,455 --> 00:57:28,790
Hello, this is security.

904
00:57:30,667 --> 00:57:31,960
A woman in her fifties?

905
00:57:32,043 --> 00:57:33,586
<i>What does she look like?</i>

906
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:35,713
<i>A mint-colored jacket and a perm.</i>

907
00:57:35,797 --> 00:57:38,675
I understand. I'll check right now.

908
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:43,138
A mint-colored jacket and a perm.

909
00:57:53,106 --> 00:57:54,232
A mint-colored jacket.

00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:23,136
You're in the lobby?

913
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,930
I'll be right there. Just wait one moment.

914
00:58:45,533 --> 00:58:47,368
What evidence am I looking for?

915
00:58:48,953 --> 00:58:50,830
Damn it, what do I look for?

916
00:58:56,085 --> 00:58:57,128
A DNA test.

917
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:07,555
SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY

918
00:59:07,639 --> 00:59:09,057
It's her! That's her!

EMERGENCY ROOM ENTRANCE

920
00:59:16,022 --> 00:59:17,106
It is her.

921
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:19,234
The elevators.

922
00:59:19,734 --> 00:59:21,194
And then…

923
00:59:25,907 --> 00:59:26,908
What?

924
00:59:28,952 --> 00:59:32,205
Where did she go?
She was just in the elevator.

925
00:59:32,288 --> 00:59:33,289
What's going on?

926
00:59:33,873 --> 00:59:35,333
You still haven't found her?

927
00:59:35,416 --> 00:59:36,751
<i>I'm sorry, Director.</i>

928
00:59:36,834 --> 00:59:39,003
<i>There's no footage of her leaving,</i>

929
00:59:39,087 --> 00:59:40,421
so I'm sure she's inside.

930
00:59:40,505 --> 00:59:42,507
Find her right now before she leaves!

931
00:59:42,632 --> 00:59:44,759
<i>Yes, sir. I'll call you as soon as I do.</i>

932
00:59:58,022 --> 00:59:59,399
Did anyone come in here?

933
00:59:59,482 --> 01:00:01,234
No, sir. No one.

935
01:01:17,268 --> 01:01:18,102
Sir!

936
01:01:21,731 --> 01:01:23,691

are you?

945

MISS NIGHT AND DAY

946
01:03:11,966 --> 01:03:15,511
<i>Has the time come for us now
to put this to an end?</i>

947
01:03:15,595 --> 01:03:17,889
<i>Why would he run a blood test on me?</i>

948
01:03:17,972 --> 01:03:20,308
- That's cold!
<i>- Do you like older women as well?</i>

949
01:03:20,391 --> 01:03:22,518
She's 20 years older, you punk!
You weren't even born!

950
01:03:22,602 --> 01:03:24,979
Anyways, I might not be able
to come in tonight.

951
01:03:25,104 --> 01:03:27,648
<i>She started dating late,
and now, she's going hard.</i>

952
01:03:27,732 --> 01:03:28,900
Get it together!

953
01:03:28,983 --> 01:03:30,359
<i>Let's finish the job quick.</i>

954
01:03:31,444 --> 01:03:33,488
- I'll head down first.
<i>- </i>My goodness!

955
01:03:35,448 --> 01:03:37,325
<i>What's your relationship with Mi-jin?</i>

956
01:03:37,408 --> 01:03:40,286
<i>- I just really like someone.
- I know how that feels.</i>
