00:00:32,111 --> 00:00:33,529
What happened?

8
00:00:33,613 --> 00:00:35,031
There's no time to explain.

9
00:00:42,705 --> 00:00:43,706
Hello, 911?

10
00:00:44,165 --> 00:00:46,501
Someone has fainted here.
Can you please hurry?

11
00:00:47,794 --> 00:00:48,920
Okay.

HWADONG MEDICAL CENTER

13
00:01:25,331 --> 00:01:26,874
What were you two doing there?

14
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:28,501
Why did she suddenly faint?

15
00:01:29,669 --> 00:01:31,087
I didn't know you knew each other.

16
00:01:31,671 --> 00:01:32,839
I could say the same.

17
00:01:33,673 --> 00:01:34,549
We met at work.

18
00:01:35,758 --> 00:01:37,760
Work? What type of work?

19
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:40,888
I don't think I need to tell you that.

20
00:01:40,972 --> 00:01:42,890
Then, she fainted while working?

21
00:01:44,142 --> 00:01:45,309
There must be a reason.

22
00:02:05,246 --> 00:02:06,080
Chu!

23
00:02:13,504 --> 00:02:14,797
CEO

24
00:02:24,056 --> 00:02:26,851
Why do I think this situation
seems to have something to do with you?

25
00:02:29,604 --> 00:02:30,730
What if it doesn't?

26
00:02:31,606 --> 00:02:33,774
- Would you believe me?
- It better not.

27
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:37,653
If you're involved, I'll make things
very difficult for you.

28
00:02:38,237 --> 00:02:39,572
It won't compare to last time.

29
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,411
Doctor.

30
00:02:57,173 --> 00:02:59,425
She fainted,
but you're still not attending to her?

31
00:02:59,509 --> 00:03:01,677
You should at least explain
what happened.

32
00:03:01,761 --> 00:03:03,012
Didn't you hear?

33
00:03:03,596 --> 00:03:04,555
About what?

34
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:11,771
Her white blood cell count
was unusually high in her blood test.

35
00:03:11,854 --> 00:03:16,192
If she has no underlying conditions,
I suspect she took too much medication.

36
00:03:17,193 --> 00:03:21,030
Overconsumption of anxiety medication
can cause side effects like drowsiness.

37
00:03:21,572 --> 00:03:22,990
So she's sleeping right now?

38
00:03:23,074 --> 00:03:24,826
We'll run tests when she wakes up.

39
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:26,619
So let's talk more in detail then.

40
00:03:31,249 --> 00:03:32,625
Anxiety medication?

41
00:03:37,588 --> 00:03:38,798
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

42
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:41,634
- The hospital.
- The hospital?

43
00:03:41,717 --> 00:03:42,760
Which hospital?

44
00:03:43,928 --> 00:03:45,972
<i>Did you split the pills with her?</i>

45
00:03:46,055 --> 00:03:48,057
<i>How generous of you!</i>

46
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,435
No, I didn't mean to give them to her.
I was going to take them.

47
00:03:51,978 --> 00:03:53,479
They were just anxiety meds.

48
00:03:53,563 --> 00:03:55,815
Anxiety meds are drugs too!
Are you crazy?

49
00:03:55,898 --> 00:03:58,651
Of course, I am.
Why else would I take them?

50
00:04:02,446 --> 00:04:03,739
Then, we'll say this.

51
00:04:03,823 --> 00:04:06,367
You never tried to take anxiety meds.

52
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:09,120
<i>No, you were never even there. Got it?</i>

53
00:04:09,203 --> 00:04:10,413
What are you saying?

54
00:04:10,496 --> 00:04:12,456
She just fainted on her own, okay?

55
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,875
If you just keep quiet…

56
00:04:15,877 --> 00:04:17,962
She won't know why she passed out.

57
00:04:18,045 --> 00:04:19,255
Are you crazy?

58
00:04:23,718 --> 00:04:25,595
She passed out after taking my drugs.

59
00:04:25,678 --> 00:04:27,430
They weren't anxiety meds, were they?

60
00:04:30,975 --> 00:04:31,809
Are you crazy?

61
00:04:32,476 --> 00:04:35,146
Was it temporary insanity again?
What's your excuse this time?

62
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:36,856
Was it because the suspect died?

63
00:04:37,607 --> 00:04:39,317
Don't bring others down with you.

64
00:04:39,984 --> 00:04:41,736
Leave innocent people alone.

65
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:44,113
I was just…

66
00:04:44,196 --> 00:04:45,907
I was going to take them but…

67
00:04:49,702 --> 00:04:51,245
Mi-jin, are you okay?

68
00:04:52,747 --> 00:04:53,956
What? What happened?

69
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,291
Give this to me.

70
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,543
- Wait…
- Gosh.

71
00:04:57,627 --> 00:04:59,795
No one was there.

72
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,297
- This hurts.
- Why did you come out?

73
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,882
My head hurts.

74
00:05:04,216 --> 00:05:06,344
INFORMATION
HWADONG MEDICAL CENTER

75
00:05:07,762 --> 00:05:09,430
- Mr. Gye, I'll--
- Are you still…

76
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:11,974
Are you really dizzy?

77
00:05:13,643 --> 00:05:14,852
I'm fine.

78
00:05:17,355 --> 00:05:18,439
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:19,398 --> 00:05:20,566
Can we talk?

80
00:05:21,317 --> 00:05:22,443
You haven't recovered.

81
00:05:22,526 --> 00:05:24,445
You can't be discharged yet.

82
00:05:24,528 --> 00:05:27,281
Do you know why you fainted?
Or why you lost consciousness?

83
00:05:34,622 --> 00:05:37,875
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

84
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:38,918
I'll take you home.

85
00:05:40,002 --> 00:05:42,380
No, I can go alone.

86
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,548
- But you're not well.
- Thank you.

87
00:06:12,243 --> 00:06:13,077
Get in.

88
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,746
I didn't come for a ride. We need to talk.

89
00:06:25,172 --> 00:06:26,507
Get in. We can talk on the way.

90
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,426
No, let's talk now.

91
00:06:32,012 --> 00:06:34,140
Explain what you said to me earlier.

92
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:36,809
I know I heard you correctly.

93
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,521
The sun will set soon.

94
00:06:42,106 --> 00:06:44,150
Don't move or you might get caught.

95
00:06:46,027 --> 00:06:47,236
What did you mean?

96
00:06:49,864 --> 00:06:51,824
Do you really know everything?

97
00:07:05,337 --> 00:07:07,423
Don't worry. I'll keep your secret.

98
00:07:13,262 --> 00:07:14,764
How did you find out?

99
00:07:20,061 --> 00:07:22,521
Tell me right now! How did you find out?

100
00:07:25,983 --> 00:07:27,276
I kept watching you.

101
00:08:36,011 --> 00:08:37,721
Should we get started?

102
00:08:50,276 --> 00:08:54,280
<i>I want to eat some good food</i>

103
00:09:03,914 --> 00:09:05,124
What was that?

104
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,418
This doesn't make sense.

105
00:09:15,926 --> 00:09:17,052
I'll keep your secret.

106
00:09:20,222 --> 00:09:21,307
Ma'am…

107
00:09:24,018 --> 00:09:25,019
I mean, you.

108
00:09:25,895 --> 00:09:27,438
You kept my secret too.

109
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,275
I'll keep your secret,

110
00:09:32,276 --> 00:09:33,277
so you can trust me.

111
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:45,998
Mi-jin!

112
00:09:46,081 --> 00:09:47,041
I have to go.

113
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:49,251
You can't just leave…

114
00:09:49,335 --> 00:09:50,169
Hey!

115
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:54,506
- Who's that?
- Don't look. It's three years bad luck.

116
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,591
- I mean it.
- Okay.

117
00:09:55,674 --> 00:09:57,468
- I'm not lying.
- Are you okay though?

118
00:09:57,593 --> 00:10:00,262
- Hey, don't look!
- Okay. Hold tight.

119
00:10:17,112 --> 00:10:18,322
<i>I'll keep your secret.</i>

120
00:10:20,282 --> 00:10:21,283
<i>So you can trust me.</i>

121
00:10:47,434 --> 00:10:48,894
- Damn it.
- What is it?

122
00:10:49,853 --> 00:10:51,146
Did you sprain something?

123
00:10:51,563 --> 00:10:52,982
What's wrong with my body?

124
00:10:53,065 --> 00:10:55,651
Hey, after eight years
of studying for civil service exams,

125
00:10:55,734 --> 00:10:58,696
all you had
was your stubborn will and stamina.

126
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:00,489
So what's with you?

127
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:03,826
I know, but my body feels strange.

128
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:04,910
What is it?

129
00:11:05,411 --> 00:11:08,372
Wasn't it just your face that aged?
Your stamina was fine.

130
00:11:08,455 --> 00:11:10,624
- I know. That's what I thought.
- Right.

131
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:12,918
Could I have been wrong?

132
00:11:13,836 --> 00:11:15,796
Don't overdo it! Take it easy.

133
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,881
- It's okay. Sit down.
- Okay.

134
00:11:24,346 --> 00:11:25,389
Come on.

135
00:11:26,348 --> 00:11:27,391
Stop scaring me.

136
00:11:28,142 --> 00:11:29,018
Hey.

137
00:11:29,727 --> 00:11:33,230
What if I keep aging like this and die--

138
00:11:33,313 --> 00:11:35,274
Seriously, stop it!

139
00:11:36,316 --> 00:11:37,151
Okay.

140
00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:41,989
Forget it.
Just think about finding that cat.

141
00:11:42,072 --> 00:11:45,367
I'm going to hang a huge banner
at the intersection tomorrow.

142
00:11:45,993 --> 00:11:47,286
Okay, thanks.

143
00:11:52,249 --> 00:11:53,417
It's so weird.

144
00:11:57,588 --> 00:11:58,797
Hey, what's with you?

145
00:12:00,758 --> 00:12:02,593
- Well?
- Are you okay?

146
00:12:02,676 --> 00:12:03,677
Yeah.

147
00:12:04,553 --> 00:12:06,346
- It'll be okay.
- Yeah.

148
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,515
- Don't worry.
- Okay.

149
00:12:15,397 --> 00:12:16,398
It's right.

150
00:12:17,066 --> 00:12:19,777
Mr. Jeong, have them delivered right away.

151
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,612
I'll deposit the money tonight.

152
00:12:21,695 --> 00:12:23,030
Don't be late again.

153
00:12:23,781 --> 00:12:25,991
- What?
- I waited because I trust you.

154
00:12:26,075 --> 00:12:27,326
I don't normally do this.

155
00:12:27,409 --> 00:12:28,911
What are you talking about?

156
00:12:28,994 --> 00:12:31,747
My daughter said
she deposited it right away that night.

157
00:12:32,623 --> 00:12:34,333
"Seohan Provincial Police Agency"?

158
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:36,960
You must've been mistaken.

159
00:12:37,044 --> 00:12:39,546
Do I need to show you
that it was deposited today?

160
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,548
What's with all the chatter?

161
00:12:43,092 --> 00:12:45,719
I mean, let's go if you're done.

162
00:12:45,803 --> 00:12:47,179
- Bye, Mr. Jeong.
- Bye.

163
00:12:49,098 --> 00:12:50,766
Wait, honey. Let go.

164
00:12:50,849 --> 00:12:52,476
He must've been mistaken.

165
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:54,561
Mi-jin wouldn't have deposited it late.

166
00:12:54,645 --> 00:12:56,522
Well, that's what I'm saying.

167
00:12:56,605 --> 00:13:01,026
She's just like you.
She's so upright and stubborn.

168
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,737
She wouldn't steal
a single cent from anyone.

169
00:13:03,821 --> 00:13:04,988
She'd never deposit it late.

170
00:13:05,072 --> 00:13:07,116
Exactly, and he got the money.

171
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,743
What's left to talk about?
Don't be so stubborn.

172
00:13:10,536 --> 00:13:12,037
I'll just do it myself from now on.

173
00:13:12,121 --> 00:13:13,288
Yeah.

174
00:13:26,301 --> 00:13:29,555
MY FATHER DISAPPEARED! PLEASE FIND HIM!
PLEASE CALL IF YOU SAW HIM

175
00:13:36,854 --> 00:13:39,231
<i>Did her father work here?</i>

176
00:13:39,898 --> 00:13:41,817
<i>Why is she doing that here?</i>

177
00:13:43,068 --> 00:13:44,069
Ms. Lim.

178
00:13:49,116 --> 00:13:50,117
Ms. Lim?

179
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:58,959
Ms. Lim?

180
00:13:59,793 --> 00:14:00,919
- Ms. Lim!
- My goodness!

181
00:14:01,003 --> 00:14:04,006
Mr. Gye's been calling you,
but you weren't answering.

182
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:06,133
- Yes, sir?
- Are you feeling okay?

183
00:14:06,216 --> 00:14:07,468
You don't look so good.

184
00:14:07,551 --> 00:14:08,802
I'm fine.

185
00:14:08,886 --> 00:14:10,679
Is something the matter?

186
00:14:10,762 --> 00:14:13,474
The attachment was missing
from the email you sent yesterday.

187
00:14:13,557 --> 00:14:14,933
I'm so sorry.

188
00:14:15,017 --> 00:14:16,560
I'll print it out for you now.

189
00:14:16,643 --> 00:14:17,811
Okay, take your time.

190
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,941
Thank you.

191
00:14:30,032 --> 00:14:32,451
NUMBER 35, 6438, SUV, GRAY
HWADONG MEDICAL CENTER

192
00:14:35,746 --> 00:14:37,456
Didn't you say the former director

193
00:14:37,539 --> 00:14:39,541
of Hwadong Medical Center
works here?

194
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,668
- Director Baek Cheol-gyu?
- Yes.

195
00:14:42,628 --> 00:14:44,379
How long has he worked here now?

196
00:14:45,088 --> 00:14:46,089
It's been two weeks.

197
00:14:47,508 --> 00:14:50,469
<i>The sulfuric acid attack
occurred here on October 16.</i>

198
00:14:50,552 --> 00:14:53,847
<i>Baek Cheol-gyu was hired
as a senior public intern on October 23.</i>

199
00:14:54,556 --> 00:14:55,557
<i>One week apart.</i>

200
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:57,476
Excuse me.

201
00:14:58,435 --> 00:15:01,772
After Ko Na-heun left,
he came as his replacement.

202
00:15:02,397 --> 00:15:05,234
It hasn't been that long,
but someone has already quit?

203
00:15:05,317 --> 00:15:07,653
He was terminated
for being absent without notice.

204
00:15:08,695 --> 00:15:10,948
<i>After the incident,
he joined the prosecutors' office</i>

205
00:15:11,031 --> 00:15:12,658
<i>as an absent employee's replacement?</i>

206
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:17,246
Is something the matter
with Director Baek Cheol-gyu?

207
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:19,748
- We need to find out.
- Excuse me.

208
00:15:19,831 --> 00:15:21,625
Can I look into it by any chance?

209
00:15:22,334 --> 00:15:25,254
- What?
- I've lived in this town for a while.

210
00:15:25,337 --> 00:15:27,464
I know Hwadong Medical Center pretty well.

211
00:15:27,548 --> 00:15:30,592
We're both senior public interns,
so we can easily become acquainted.

212
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:32,261
We'd be grateful.

213
00:15:32,344 --> 00:15:34,263
I understand you want to work hard.

214
00:15:34,346 --> 00:15:36,306
But you almost passed out last time.

215
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,016
Please refrain from other tasks.

216
00:15:43,146 --> 00:15:44,147
Yes, sir.

217
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,034
<i>Jeez, I was hoisted by my own petard.
Serves me right.</i>

218
00:15:56,118 --> 00:15:58,245
<i>After using pain as an excuse
to get out of trouble,</i>

219
00:15:58,328 --> 00:16:00,998
<i>I get special treatment
for being old and sick now.</i>

220
00:16:01,957 --> 00:16:02,791
<i>Jeez.</i>

221
00:16:08,922 --> 00:16:09,923
Sun!

222
00:16:13,844 --> 00:16:16,471
What? Why is she running away?
Sun! Your coffee!

223
00:16:17,514 --> 00:16:18,682
- What?
- Go away!

224
00:16:18,765 --> 00:16:19,766
Your iced coffee!

225
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,852
What? Where are you going?

226
00:16:22,603 --> 00:16:24,313
What in the world did he see?

227
00:16:25,147 --> 00:16:26,898
Why do you keep following me? Why?

228
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:29,651
Sun, stop!

229
00:16:30,277 --> 00:16:31,612
Come on!

230
00:16:32,821 --> 00:16:34,156
Jeez, stop!

231
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:36,241
Are you going to avoid me forever?

232
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:02,726
Aren't you happy that I know?

233
00:17:03,477 --> 00:17:05,145
I can help you.

234
00:17:05,228 --> 00:17:06,271
How can you help?

235
00:17:07,898 --> 00:17:10,025
Can you release me from this damn curse?

236
00:17:21,286 --> 00:17:22,120
First,

237
00:17:22,204 --> 00:17:23,580
sell me your coupon.

238
00:17:24,581 --> 00:17:25,499
What coupon?

239
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:27,876
Mr. Cha's wish coupon.

240
00:17:45,268 --> 00:17:46,311
Okay, smile!

241
00:17:46,395 --> 00:17:48,438
One, two, three!

242
00:17:52,442 --> 00:17:53,694
I'll buy it for 500,000 won.

243
00:17:53,777 --> 00:17:55,904
Excuse me! What do you take me for?

244
00:17:55,987 --> 00:17:57,739
Okay, one million won.

245
00:17:58,532 --> 00:18:00,701
Gifts shouldn't be bought
or sold for money.

246
00:18:02,035 --> 00:18:02,869
Three million won.

247
00:18:03,704 --> 00:18:06,081
MONEY LOST FROM SCAM
SELL GAME ITEMS AND COUPON

248
00:18:06,164 --> 00:18:07,249
PRETTY MUCH PAID OFF

249
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,251
Sold to the highest bid!

250
00:18:09,835 --> 00:18:11,002
Transfer complete!

251
00:18:14,423 --> 00:18:16,466
But what are you going to do with that?

252
00:18:23,098 --> 00:18:25,976
WISH COUPON
ISSUED BY CHA JAE-SEONG

253
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:27,227
Why do you have this?

254
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,437
It was handed over to me.

255
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,646
It was?

256
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,815
This isn't something you can hand over.

257
00:18:31,898 --> 00:18:33,608
That's not written on there.

258
00:18:34,443 --> 00:18:37,821
And it's against the Fair Trade Act
to not recognize issued coupons.

259
00:18:38,447 --> 00:18:39,656
"Not recognize"?

260
00:18:40,449 --> 00:18:42,868
An unconditional wish coupon.
Was it a false promise?

261
00:18:42,951 --> 00:18:46,580
When did I ever say
it was unconditional? Come on!

262
00:18:47,372 --> 00:18:48,540
You did though.

263
00:18:48,623 --> 00:18:50,625
Excuse me. Didn't he say that?

264
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:52,544
- Yes, he did.
- Excuse me?

265
00:18:59,384 --> 00:19:01,511
Yeah, fine! So what's your wish then?

266
00:19:02,095 --> 00:19:02,929
Goodness.

267
00:19:03,805 --> 00:19:06,725
I'll be your assistant secretary.

268
00:19:07,642 --> 00:19:09,060
- What?
- Assistant secretary.

269
00:19:09,144 --> 00:19:10,604
I don't have a secretary.

270
00:19:11,104 --> 00:19:13,523
I heard a busy office clerk
does your secretarial work.

271
00:19:16,485 --> 00:19:17,778
I'll do it for you.

272
00:19:17,861 --> 00:19:18,945
Jeez!

273
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:19,988
Who said that?

274
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:21,156
Did Ms. Kim say that?

275
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:23,200
That she's busy
but I gave her secretary duties?

276
00:19:23,283 --> 00:19:24,284
No, she didn't.

277
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:27,370
But I'm sure the other clerks
don't want to do the work.

278
00:19:27,454 --> 00:19:28,497
Look.

279
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,542
Not only do we not have
an assistant secretary position here--

280
00:19:32,626 --> 00:19:33,877
Come on.

281
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,546
You have an office aide,
so why not an assistant secretary?

282
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,757
- I want to do it.
- For goodness' sake.

283
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,052
Also, I've been going on two hours
of sleep a day since I was a trainee.

284
00:19:42,135 --> 00:19:43,678
So being really busy doesn't faze me.

285
00:19:44,262 --> 00:19:45,514
Listen!

286
00:19:45,597 --> 00:19:47,557
I'm saying this makes me uncomfortable!

287
00:19:47,641 --> 00:19:50,227
Don't you think it's wrong
to be stubborn about…

288
00:19:53,939 --> 00:19:54,815
No matter what.

289
00:19:54,898 --> 00:19:57,818
Wow, what a complete lunatic.

290
00:20:04,491 --> 00:20:06,034
That'll be 13,000 won.

291
00:20:07,077 --> 00:20:09,162
Do a lot of Hwadong Medical patients
come here?

292
00:20:09,246 --> 00:20:11,998
They'd go to convenience stores,
not mom-and-pop stores.

293
00:20:12,082 --> 00:20:13,500
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

294
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,378
I heard the director there
was pretty strange though.

295
00:20:16,461 --> 00:20:18,088
Goodness, who said that?

296
00:20:19,297 --> 00:20:21,967
<i>He's a very mild-mannered gentleman.</i>

297
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:24,636
<i>He treats so many sick children.</i>

298
00:20:24,719 --> 00:20:27,514
- Where does it hurt?
<i>- Some of the elderly can't afford care.</i>

299
00:20:27,597 --> 00:20:29,683
<i>So he goes and treats them for free.</i>

300
00:20:29,766 --> 00:20:31,601
<i>There's no one else like him.</i>

301
00:20:31,685 --> 00:20:33,186
Looking at your medical chart…

302
00:20:34,437 --> 00:20:35,438
I see.

303
00:20:36,314 --> 00:20:37,399
So he's a good man.

304
00:20:37,482 --> 00:20:38,525
Have a great day.

305
00:20:38,608 --> 00:20:39,901
Tell me if you need more.

306
00:20:39,985 --> 00:20:40,986
- Okay.
- Okay.

307
00:20:41,736 --> 00:20:44,072
Okay, please enjoy these cold drinks.

308
00:20:44,406 --> 00:20:45,240
Thank you.

309
00:20:45,323 --> 00:20:48,660
So when did the director's wife die again?

310
00:20:49,286 --> 00:20:51,621
I think it's been about 20 years, right?

311
00:20:51,705 --> 00:20:54,332
There was a lot of commotion
around the town then.

312
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:55,834
There was so much talk.

313
00:20:56,459 --> 00:20:58,169
Did something happen?

314
00:20:59,838 --> 00:21:02,424
Find out what you can
about Baek Cheol-gyu.

315
00:21:02,883 --> 00:21:06,011
You suspect this 6438 car you saw
at the scene was the culprit?

316
00:21:06,511 --> 00:21:09,097
They fled after seeing me,
so it means they know me.

317
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,100
Even if they're not the culprit,
they're at least involved.

318
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:13,852
After his wife died,

319
00:21:13,935 --> 00:21:18,189
he was so upset that he tried
to follow her into the afterlife.

320
00:21:18,273 --> 00:21:20,442
He fell severely ill overnight,

321
00:21:20,525 --> 00:21:22,485
and he even quit being a doctor.

322
00:21:22,569 --> 00:21:25,488
He quit the hospital
after his wife passed.

323
00:21:26,072 --> 00:21:29,492
But he started going around
with a big bag to help people.

324
00:21:29,576 --> 00:21:33,747
For him, helping other people
is the only joy he has.

325
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:34,915
That's right.

326
00:21:38,418 --> 00:21:39,502
He's too clean.

327
00:21:39,586 --> 00:21:41,922
- Hello, Dr. Baek.
- Hi, how are you?

328
00:21:47,302 --> 00:21:50,555
Why are you telling me
about what your subordinate did?

329
00:21:51,348 --> 00:21:53,642
Do whatever you can to take care of it.

330
00:21:53,725 --> 00:21:55,560
That way we'll both be in the clear.

331
00:22:03,693 --> 00:22:05,654
I'm about to take the fall for everything!

332
00:22:05,737 --> 00:22:08,615
Before I expose
why you tried to kill that person,

333
00:22:08,698 --> 00:22:10,116
handle it now.

334
00:22:22,504 --> 00:22:25,965
CLEAN UP YOUR OWN MESS

335
00:22:53,576 --> 00:22:54,703
Are you okay?

336
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:58,456
You've been standing here for days.
You'll pass out like this.

337
00:22:58,998 --> 00:23:01,584
It'll be bad if you become dehydrated.
Come with me.

338
00:23:02,627 --> 00:23:03,628
Your bag.

339
00:23:07,257 --> 00:23:09,467
Your father worked
at the prosecutors' office

340
00:23:10,051 --> 00:23:11,219
before he went missing?

341
00:23:12,721 --> 00:23:13,888
My dad…

342
00:23:15,181 --> 00:23:18,059
He took care of me for over 20 years
with his injured leg.

343
00:23:20,437 --> 00:23:23,064
He always made sure
I never ate dinner alone.

344
00:23:25,942 --> 00:23:27,652
He said he wasn't a good enough father,

345
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,488
so he couldn't do anything for me.

346
00:23:32,991 --> 00:23:33,867
That's why

347
00:23:35,034 --> 00:23:38,037
he'd always personally prepare
dinner for me.

348
00:23:38,621 --> 00:23:39,497
<i>I'm just happy</i>

349
00:23:40,081 --> 00:23:43,334
<i>to at least have a chance
to work like this.</i>

350
00:23:45,003 --> 00:23:46,212
<i>The dinner was canceled.</i>

351
00:23:46,838 --> 00:23:47,839
<i>On my way home,</i>

352
00:23:47,922 --> 00:23:49,382
<i>I'll buy you something tasty.</i>

353
00:23:49,966 --> 00:23:52,469
<i>I'll make your favorite,
beef soybean paste stew.</i>

354
00:23:52,552 --> 00:23:53,803
<i>Hurry home.</i>

355
00:24:10,862 --> 00:24:12,363
<i>Dad, where are you?</i>

356
00:24:24,626 --> 00:24:27,045
<i>The person you are trying to call
is unavailable.</i>

357
00:24:27,128 --> 00:24:28,505
<i>Leave a message after the tone.</i>

358
00:24:29,714 --> 00:24:31,216
<i>Dad, where are you?</i>

359
00:24:31,883 --> 00:24:33,593
<i>Why is your phone off?</i>

360
00:24:34,177 --> 00:24:35,887
<i>Should I come get you?</i>

361
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,972
<i>Dad, I'm worried.</i>

362
00:24:38,056 --> 00:24:40,767
<i>Text me back when you see this, okay?</i>

363
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:44,229
He wasn't able to get a job
because of his disability.

364
00:24:44,896 --> 00:24:48,399
He was so happy to be working
at a prestigious prosecutors' office.

365
00:24:48,942 --> 00:24:50,360
But why would he leave home?

366
00:24:52,445 --> 00:24:54,405
I'll look into it.

367
00:24:56,032 --> 00:24:57,033
By any chance,

368
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,828
could you tell me your father's name?

369
00:25:01,371 --> 00:25:03,289
Ko Na-heun.

370
00:25:04,624 --> 00:25:05,792
Ko Na-heun?

371
00:25:10,505 --> 00:25:13,967
I think Ko Na-heun has gone missing.

372
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,305
How long has it been
since he's been out of contact?

373
00:25:19,389 --> 00:25:21,432
Ever since he stopped coming to work.

374
00:25:21,516 --> 00:25:22,725
Anything else of note?

375
00:25:22,809 --> 00:25:25,478
No one's heard from him
since he said he got off work.

376
00:25:25,562 --> 00:25:26,896
His phone's been off too.

377
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,566
There were no transactions
on his card either.

378
00:25:29,649 --> 00:25:33,903
That means there's no sign
of everyday activities.

379
00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:36,948
Do you think something bad
happened to him?

380
00:25:37,031 --> 00:25:39,200
He's a grown adult. What could happen?

381
00:25:39,284 --> 00:25:41,786
He's probably out somewhere playing cards.

382
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:42,829
You know,

383
00:25:43,413 --> 00:25:47,000
there's one case
I've never been able to solve.

384
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:48,209
An unsolved case?

385
00:25:50,211 --> 00:25:52,463
Cases of serial disappearances
in Seohan City.

386
00:25:53,298 --> 00:25:55,717
<i>Cases of serial disappearances
in Seohan City?</i>

387
00:25:57,302 --> 00:25:59,095
CASES OF SERIAL DISAPPEARANCES
IN SEOHAN CITY

388
00:25:59,178 --> 00:26:00,221
What is this?

389
00:26:04,142 --> 00:26:05,351
<i>Was that the same case?</i>

390
00:26:05,435 --> 00:26:09,147
In the end, the case died out
without any evidence.

391
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,442
There weren't any witnesses either?

392
00:26:12,525 --> 00:26:14,527
Well, that's…

393
00:26:15,737 --> 00:26:18,406
Tens of thousands of adults
are reported missing each year.

394
00:26:20,158 --> 00:26:22,118
Maybe you're blowing it
out of proportion.

395
00:26:22,201 --> 00:26:24,245
Unbelievable. What do you even know

396
00:26:24,329 --> 00:26:28,207
about investigations
to talk about missing adults like that?

397
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:31,544
Why are you being angry at him?
It's not like he was wrong.

398
00:26:31,628 --> 00:26:33,838
- What?
- It's true.

399
00:26:33,922 --> 00:26:36,758
What would be the use
of carrying off a grown old man?

400
00:26:37,842 --> 00:26:39,886
Well, you know what?

401
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,305
He probably ran away then!

402
00:26:49,979 --> 00:26:52,982
<i>Did he know when he asked me that?</i>

403
00:26:53,524 --> 00:26:56,819
It's about the person
who held this position before I did.

404
00:26:56,903 --> 00:26:58,821
I was wondering why he quit.

405
00:26:58,905 --> 00:27:00,490
By any chance…

406
00:27:00,573 --> 00:27:02,575
Something didn't happen, did it?

407
00:27:11,626 --> 00:27:12,627
Excuse me!

408
00:27:15,046 --> 00:27:17,840
Why were they serial disappearances?

409
00:27:20,343 --> 00:27:22,887
Well, right before they'd disappear,

410
00:27:22,971 --> 00:27:24,430
there'd be a similar pattern.

411
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,683
- A pattern?
- Yeah.

412
00:27:26,766 --> 00:27:29,477
They took out loans from banks,
withdrew from their savings,

413
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,895
settled their affairs,

414
00:27:30,979 --> 00:27:32,981
and used their credit cards a bunch too.

415
00:27:33,064 --> 00:27:35,650
They even borrowed money
from the people they knew.

416
00:27:35,733 --> 00:27:38,236
I see, as if they were going to leave.

417
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,320
That's right.

418
00:27:39,821 --> 00:27:40,697
On the surface.

419
00:27:41,698 --> 00:27:42,782
Why do you suddenly ask?

420
00:27:42,865 --> 00:27:44,492
Well, it's just…

421
00:27:45,243 --> 00:27:47,787
I was wondering if someone I knew
was involved in that case.

422
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,915
- Someone you know?
- But it wasn't.

423
00:27:50,999 --> 00:27:52,417
It wasn't a disappearance.

424
00:28:04,053 --> 00:28:05,805
- Mom.
- Yes?

425
00:28:05,888 --> 00:28:06,764
So…

426
00:28:08,516 --> 00:28:10,977
Before Aunt Sun left home…

427
00:28:12,603 --> 00:28:14,230
Why do you suddenly ask?

428
00:28:14,314 --> 00:28:16,190
Did she use her credit cards

429
00:28:16,274 --> 00:28:19,068
or borrow money from the bank?

430
00:28:20,194 --> 00:28:21,821
Don't you know who your aunt is?

431
00:28:22,488 --> 00:28:25,450
She worked at the bank
and never wasted any money.

432
00:28:26,909 --> 00:28:28,036
Right?

433
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:29,537
Why do you ask?

434
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,830
I was just wondering.

435
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:34,876
I'm sure she's doing fine.

436
00:28:36,836 --> 00:28:37,837
Mom.

437
00:28:38,921 --> 00:28:41,215
Aunt Sun's not missing, right?

438
00:28:42,675 --> 00:28:43,676
That's right.

439
00:28:45,345 --> 00:28:48,056
Didn't you hear what they said
at the police station?

440
00:28:48,139 --> 00:28:49,182
She ran away.

441
00:28:49,891 --> 00:28:52,185
The police said there was no way
she was missing.

442
00:28:52,268 --> 00:28:53,644
Even if that were the case,

443
00:28:54,854 --> 00:28:56,439
we looked everywhere for her.

444
00:29:00,026 --> 00:29:02,070
Please take a look. She's my sister.

445
00:29:02,153 --> 00:29:04,906
Please look at this.
She's my sister, Lim Sun.

446
00:29:04,989 --> 00:29:07,992
Auntie.

447
00:29:08,076 --> 00:29:09,160
I miss you.

448
00:29:09,243 --> 00:29:10,203
Please.

449
00:29:11,037 --> 00:29:14,332
Please take a look at this.
Her name's Lim Sun. She's my sister.

450
00:29:14,415 --> 00:29:16,417
Help me find her. Please!

451
00:29:16,501 --> 00:29:17,919
Could you take a close look?

452
00:29:18,711 --> 00:29:19,962
Please take a look.

453
00:29:21,756 --> 00:29:22,882
Take a look at this.

454
00:29:23,758 --> 00:29:25,426
Could you take a look at this?

455
00:29:27,178 --> 00:29:29,347
Please take a look at this.

456
00:29:29,972 --> 00:29:32,100
She's my sister. Could you take a look?

457
00:29:34,602 --> 00:29:35,895
Please take a look.

458
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,440
Just one look. Please.

459
00:29:40,066 --> 00:29:41,484
Please look at this.

460
00:29:54,872 --> 00:29:56,082
MISSING PERSON

461
00:30:16,686 --> 00:30:18,438
Here's your favorite.

462
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,569
- You should've brought me soju.
- What?

463
00:30:24,652 --> 00:30:25,695
Please.

464
00:30:25,778 --> 00:30:27,905
You have dementia and diabetes.

465
00:30:27,989 --> 00:30:29,657
How could you ask for that?

466
00:30:30,116 --> 00:30:32,952
You don't even deserve that popsicle.
I'll give it to the ants.

467
00:30:33,035 --> 00:30:34,412
Don't.

468
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,789
Jeez.

469
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:41,085
The thing is

470
00:30:41,169 --> 00:30:43,337
someone I know has gone missing.

471
00:30:44,046 --> 00:30:46,382
But something feels off about it.

472
00:30:47,925 --> 00:30:48,926
Age?

473
00:30:50,011 --> 00:30:52,722
Around 60 years old at least.

474
00:30:54,098 --> 00:30:55,099
Personal details?

475
00:30:56,142 --> 00:30:57,685
Nothing special,

476
00:30:57,768 --> 00:31:00,062
aside from his bum leg.

477
00:31:00,146 --> 00:31:02,023
He has a mild temperament too.

478
00:31:02,106 --> 00:31:03,900
He isn't one to hold grudges.

479
00:31:03,983 --> 00:31:05,151
When did he go missing?

480
00:31:05,776 --> 00:31:07,778
Goodness, look at you.

481
00:31:07,862 --> 00:31:09,572
The look in your eyes has changed.

482
00:31:09,655 --> 00:31:11,532
You still think you're a detective?

483
00:31:15,161 --> 00:31:16,579
Don't worry.

484
00:31:17,288 --> 00:31:18,664
It's not a woman.

485
00:31:18,748 --> 00:31:20,958
He's very old too.

486
00:31:21,042 --> 00:31:23,794
I'm sure it's not what we're thinking.

487
00:31:25,129 --> 00:31:28,508
In any case, search all of Daeho-ri
and the surrounding area.

488
00:31:29,258 --> 00:31:31,469
Did you search
the field of reeds behind the mountain?

489
00:31:32,803 --> 00:31:34,514
This won't do. I need to go.

490
00:31:34,597 --> 00:31:36,933
Come on! Take it easy, will you?

491
00:31:37,016 --> 00:31:38,643
Don't open another investigation

492
00:31:38,726 --> 00:31:41,187
and make the squad suffer like last time!

493
00:31:43,606 --> 00:31:45,858
- I'll go there.
- Hey, come on!

494
00:31:46,442 --> 00:31:47,860
Good grief.

495
00:32:01,249 --> 00:32:04,252
I'll tell you what I saw that night.

496
00:32:05,836 --> 00:32:07,338
I'll tell you everything.

497
00:32:07,421 --> 00:32:10,091
Okay. You made the right choice.
I'm on my way.

498
00:32:12,093 --> 00:32:12,969
Okay.

499
00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:14,762
- Hey, Jeong-ho.
- Yes, sir?

500
00:32:14,845 --> 00:32:18,307
The chief called and said he got
into a crash at Hwadong Intersection.

501
00:32:18,391 --> 00:32:20,059
Hurry and bring the chief here.

502
00:32:20,142 --> 00:32:22,228
I have to go meet a witness though.

503
00:32:22,311 --> 00:32:23,312
You punk.

504
00:32:23,854 --> 00:32:25,982
Just tell the witness to come here!

505
00:32:26,065 --> 00:32:28,776
She was so nervous
that I barely talked her into it.

506
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:30,528
So we agreed to meet outside.

507
00:32:30,611 --> 00:32:31,612
Here.

508
00:32:31,696 --> 00:32:33,155
- I'll be back, sir.
- Are you kidding?

509
00:32:33,239 --> 00:32:36,993
Hey, is a witness
more important than our chief?

510
00:32:37,076 --> 00:32:38,744
Let's say you go meet the witness

511
00:32:38,828 --> 00:32:41,664
and the chief gets hurt
while trying to return without help.

512
00:32:41,747 --> 00:32:45,084
What would you do then? Are you going to
take responsibility, punk?

513
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,545
- Hey, Mal-tae.
- Yes, sir?

514
00:32:47,628 --> 00:32:49,213
- Are you busy?
- Not at all, sir.

515
00:32:49,297 --> 00:32:51,465
Detective No's on his way
to meet a witness.

516
00:32:51,549 --> 00:32:52,925
But what do we do?

517
00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:54,844
Something really urgent has come up.

518
00:32:54,927 --> 00:32:57,013
Come on, sir!

519
00:32:57,096 --> 00:32:59,890
It doesn't matter who goes.
We just need a statement!

520
00:32:59,974 --> 00:33:01,976
A witness statement?

521
00:33:02,602 --> 00:33:05,021
Sir, it was hard for me
to convince her.

522
00:33:05,104 --> 00:33:07,857
I have to get her testimony
before she changes her mind.

523
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,902
In that case,
can't Mal-tae go and get the chief?

524
00:33:11,986 --> 00:33:13,529
Don't be ridiculous. Shut it!

525
00:33:13,613 --> 00:33:15,740
It's not hard at all.

526
00:33:15,823 --> 00:33:17,700
- You can do it, right?
- Yes, sir.

527
00:33:17,783 --> 00:33:18,784
Sir!

528
00:33:18,868 --> 00:33:20,578
I have to tell him where she is!

529
00:33:20,661 --> 00:33:21,871
Just follow me!

530
00:33:21,954 --> 00:33:23,247
It's so cold.

531
00:33:27,418 --> 00:33:28,961
Why is he so late?

532
00:33:30,087 --> 00:33:32,465
I never should've said
I'd give a statement.

533
00:33:45,436 --> 00:33:48,189
I won't say anything.
I didn't see anything.

534
00:33:48,272 --> 00:33:49,899
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

535
00:33:58,783 --> 00:33:59,617
Did she leave?

536
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,203
Darn it.

537
00:34:16,634 --> 00:34:18,469
What's this?

538
00:34:18,552 --> 00:34:19,387
Is this…

539
00:34:25,476 --> 00:34:28,145
Hello? I think there's been
an accident here.

540
00:34:28,229 --> 00:34:30,731
Yes. I think something's happened.

541
00:34:33,401 --> 00:34:35,695
I didn't know either, okay?

542
00:34:35,778 --> 00:34:36,862
I didn't know

543
00:34:36,946 --> 00:34:39,532
things would turn out this way either!

544
00:34:39,615 --> 00:34:42,993
Snap out of it!
Can you just give it a rest?

545
00:34:43,077 --> 00:34:44,995
I'm exhausted, for crying out loud!

546
00:34:48,708 --> 00:34:50,918
By the way, that woman…

547
00:34:52,545 --> 00:34:54,046
The witness with a son.

548
00:34:55,673 --> 00:34:57,091
I can't reach her.

549
00:34:57,174 --> 00:34:58,134
Goodness.

550
00:34:58,968 --> 00:34:59,969
This won't do.

551
00:35:00,052 --> 00:35:02,096
I should go look for her.

552
00:35:03,264 --> 00:35:04,598
She died!

553
00:35:05,891 --> 00:35:07,768
She died a long time ago!

554
00:35:09,186 --> 00:35:10,730
She disappeared years ago.

555
00:35:10,813 --> 00:35:13,065
It'd be strange if she were still alive.

556
00:35:13,858 --> 00:35:16,026
So don't do this anymore. Please.

557
00:35:17,236 --> 00:35:20,781
Please let go of your guilt!
I'm begging you!

558
00:35:21,657 --> 00:35:22,825
No, I have to

559
00:35:22,908 --> 00:35:25,119
search the mountain behind
Hwadong Medical Center…

560
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,705
What are you doing? Want me to go alone?

561
00:35:27,788 --> 00:35:29,039
Detective Seo, come on!

562
00:35:29,123 --> 00:35:31,167
Call Yeong-sik too!

563
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,084
Hurry up!

564
00:35:32,168 --> 00:35:33,669
Detective Seo!

565
00:35:33,753 --> 00:35:36,756
- Yeong-sik! Come on!
- Please snap out of it!

566
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:37,673
Sir!

567
00:35:37,757 --> 00:35:39,759
The field of reeds
behind Daeho-ri are thick!

568
00:35:39,842 --> 00:35:41,594
We have to search thoroughly there!

569
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:46,182
Seriously?

570
00:35:46,766 --> 00:35:49,143
You're the assistant secretary
for Mr. Cha now?

571
00:35:49,226 --> 00:35:50,144
Yes.

572
00:35:50,227 --> 00:35:51,061
Why?

573
00:35:53,189 --> 00:35:55,900
Why would you spend three million
on a coupon to work there?

574
00:35:56,776 --> 00:35:58,027
Wouldn't it be uncomfortable?

575
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:00,196
You couldn't pay me to do that job.

576
00:36:00,738 --> 00:36:02,323
It's to keep my promise to you.

577
00:36:03,032 --> 00:36:04,158
What did you say?

578
00:36:05,701 --> 00:36:06,869
We're only a year apart.

579
00:36:09,747 --> 00:36:10,748
By the way,

580
00:36:11,415 --> 00:36:12,958
what's your promise to me?

581
00:36:13,042 --> 00:36:14,001
What promise?

582
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:17,922
What is it?

583
00:36:19,757 --> 00:36:21,133
What promise did we make?

584
00:36:23,636 --> 00:36:24,845
Never mind.

585
00:36:26,347 --> 00:36:27,473
What?

586
00:36:27,556 --> 00:36:29,642
You just said you did that because of me.

587
00:36:30,267 --> 00:36:31,268
What is it?

588
00:36:42,571 --> 00:36:43,572
Don't worry.

589
00:36:44,365 --> 00:36:46,700
I'll stay here and protect you.

590
00:36:56,168 --> 00:36:58,087
Here's the investigation report
from the prison.

591
00:37:05,302 --> 00:37:07,388
"Complained of stomach pain before death."

592
00:37:07,471 --> 00:37:09,932
Guard! Over here! Come quick!

593
00:37:11,058 --> 00:37:13,561
Look at this. Are you insane? Jeez.

594
00:37:15,104 --> 00:37:18,566
"The medical director administered
a sedative to treat the seizure."

595
00:37:20,025 --> 00:37:21,110
Hold tight!

596
00:37:21,193 --> 00:37:22,528
Hold him down now!

597
00:37:24,029 --> 00:37:26,699
We know this already.
Is there anything else?

598
00:37:26,782 --> 00:37:29,243
A sedative was used to treat his seizure,

599
00:37:29,326 --> 00:37:32,913
but there were strong side effects
due to his severe addiction to drugs.

600
00:37:32,997 --> 00:37:34,498
That's the medical expert's opinion.

601
00:37:35,082 --> 00:37:37,084
- It's what was expected.
- Yes, it is.

602
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:40,838
The only question here is whether or not
the doctor gave the appropriate drug.

603
00:37:40,921 --> 00:37:43,299
But even if it was an overdose,

604
00:37:43,382 --> 00:37:46,802
it was during an emergency
to calm the inmate down.

605
00:37:47,928 --> 00:37:49,680
There's plenty of wiggle room here.

606
00:38:00,566 --> 00:38:03,360
Mr. Gye?

607
00:38:03,903 --> 00:38:05,195
Gosh, it's been such a long…

608
00:38:05,821 --> 00:38:07,156
It's nice to meet you.

609
00:38:07,781 --> 00:38:09,909
- What?
- How can I help you?

610
00:38:10,492 --> 00:38:12,912
I'm Detective Kwon from Seohan PPA.

611
00:38:12,995 --> 00:38:16,457
I was in the area, and I need to give
these documents to Mr. Gye.

612
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,541
I see.

613
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:18,626
But he's not here?

614
00:38:19,126 --> 00:38:20,669
He'll be back soon.

615
00:38:21,462 --> 00:38:23,505
Should I give these to him for you?

616
00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:25,299
If you don't mind.

617
00:38:25,382 --> 00:38:26,383
They're important.

618
00:38:26,467 --> 00:38:27,468
I understand.

619
00:38:27,551 --> 00:38:28,844
Don't worry.

620
00:38:29,386 --> 00:38:30,763
Thank you very much.

621
00:38:31,263 --> 00:38:32,973
- Goodbye.
- Have a nice day.

622
00:38:34,642 --> 00:38:36,226
Damn it. Why act like you know him?

623
00:38:50,074 --> 00:38:52,326
LIST OF MISSING PERSONS IN THE 2000S

624
00:39:06,674 --> 00:39:07,633
"Yang Jae-ha."

625
00:39:07,716 --> 00:39:08,717
"Yuk Jeong-sim."

626
00:39:10,803 --> 00:39:11,762
"Lim Sun"?

627
00:39:14,431 --> 00:39:15,391
What are you doing?

628
00:39:15,474 --> 00:39:19,186
Well, Detective Kwon just stopped by.

629
00:39:19,269 --> 00:39:21,647
He asked me to give this to you.

630
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:22,564
I see.

631
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:31,240
Yes, I just got it.

632
00:39:31,824 --> 00:39:33,784
I'll look it over at home and call you.

633
00:39:33,867 --> 00:39:34,785
Okay, bye.

634
00:39:36,578 --> 00:39:39,498
Wait, are you leaving work right now?

635
00:39:39,581 --> 00:39:40,416
Yes, I am.

636
00:39:40,499 --> 00:39:42,084
I have pressing documents to go over.

637
00:39:42,584 --> 00:39:43,502
I'll be going now.

638
00:39:56,557 --> 00:39:58,726
I'm screwed. I'm totally screwed.

639
00:40:00,144 --> 00:40:02,980
If he finds out I stole my aunt's name,
I'm doomed. What do I do?

640
00:40:06,734 --> 00:40:07,651
"Home"?

641
00:40:08,777 --> 00:40:09,611
Home!

642
00:40:17,995 --> 00:40:20,706
You're leaving work early today.

643
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:22,624
You even know when I get off work?

644
00:40:22,708 --> 00:40:25,085
Your office is always
the last to turn off its lights.

645
00:40:25,169 --> 00:40:26,754
The prosecutor in Room 307.

646
00:40:26,837 --> 00:40:28,422
You seem very interested in me.

647
00:40:28,505 --> 00:40:31,884
It's because you're quite famous, Mr. Gye.

648
00:40:32,509 --> 00:40:35,304
You're more famous than I am,
Director Baek Cheol-gyu.

649
00:40:37,473 --> 00:40:38,599
By any chance,

650
00:40:39,308 --> 00:40:41,435
have you seen me anywhere else?

651
00:40:49,068 --> 00:40:50,027
Six…

652
00:40:51,361 --> 00:40:52,529
Four, three, eight.

653
00:40:53,739 --> 00:40:55,866
NUMBER 35, 6438, SUV, GRAY
HWADONG MEDICAL CENTER

654
00:40:56,575 --> 00:40:57,576
I don't know.

655
00:40:58,744 --> 00:41:00,329
Did I see you at the hospital?

656
00:41:01,789 --> 00:41:03,415
You might not remember.

657
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,460
It might not have been me.

658
00:41:26,105 --> 00:41:28,690
Did you quit gambling
to become a petty drug dealer?

659
00:41:30,192 --> 00:41:31,610
Seriously?

660
00:41:32,361 --> 00:41:33,612
I'm leaving.

661
00:41:33,946 --> 00:41:35,572
You should earn your keep first.

662
00:41:35,656 --> 00:41:38,033
Or pay back everything you've received.

663
00:41:38,951 --> 00:41:39,952
Damn it.

664
00:41:45,582 --> 00:41:46,875
Baek Cheol-gyu.

665
00:41:50,045 --> 00:41:51,505
He gives me the creeps.

666
00:42:01,765 --> 00:42:04,059
People are saying he's a local pillar,

667
00:42:04,143 --> 00:42:06,270
and he's throwing money
all over the place.

668
00:42:06,353 --> 00:42:08,188
That's why everyone's keeping quiet.

669
00:42:15,904 --> 00:42:19,199
In the past, there were tons of rumors
that he killed his wife.

670
00:42:20,701 --> 00:42:21,952
He killed his wife?

671
00:42:23,036 --> 00:42:24,830
She didn't die from an illness?

672
00:42:24,913 --> 00:42:27,082
His wife's body was discovered in a motel.

673
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:29,501
Goodness. She was having an affair.

674
00:42:29,585 --> 00:42:32,629
His wife siphoned off all of their assets,

675
00:42:32,713 --> 00:42:34,840
and the director was left penniless.

676
00:42:34,923 --> 00:42:35,924
Wow.

677
00:42:36,967 --> 00:42:40,053
Dr. Baek must've been seething with rage.

678
00:42:40,137 --> 00:42:41,889
But there was no proof.

679
00:42:41,972 --> 00:42:44,183
No evidence and no eyewitnesses.

680
00:42:44,266 --> 00:42:46,768
I bet they couldn't find a weapon
and his alibi was solid.

681
00:42:46,852 --> 00:42:49,646
So the case just fizzled out.

682
00:42:50,314 --> 00:42:51,773
What about her lover?

683
00:42:52,441 --> 00:42:53,567
Was he caught?

684
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:55,777
The woman he planned
to run away with died.

685
00:42:55,861 --> 00:42:58,113
He fled overseas with all that money.

686
00:42:58,697 --> 00:43:01,533
If he didn't,
he might be buried somewhere.

687
00:43:01,617 --> 00:43:02,993
Come on!

688
00:43:03,076 --> 00:43:05,120
You're making me lose my appetite.

689
00:43:05,204 --> 00:43:06,622
I've lost all my money as it is.

690
00:43:09,082 --> 00:43:10,083
It's a habit from work.

691
00:43:10,667 --> 00:43:12,836
Reasonable doubt.

692
00:43:22,221 --> 00:43:25,474
<i>The motel went belly up
after the murder case.</i>

693
00:43:25,557 --> 00:43:27,684
<i>That building was sold for a bargain.</i>

694
00:43:27,768 --> 00:43:31,772
<i>It was auctioned off and renovated
into an apartment building.</i>

695
00:43:31,855 --> 00:43:34,274
<i>They probably made a huge profit from it.</i>

696
00:43:35,234 --> 00:43:37,486
<i>What was the name of that building again?</i>

697
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:40,030
<i>Was it Dogi? Dog something?</i>

698
00:43:40,822 --> 00:43:43,158
<i>That's right! It was Dogavill.</i>

699
00:43:43,867 --> 00:43:45,661
Dogavill.

700
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:50,082
DOGAVILL STUDIO APARTMENT
ROOMS FOR RENT

701
00:44:02,636 --> 00:44:03,720
Mr. Gye?

702
00:44:03,804 --> 00:44:05,722
- What are you doing here?
- My question exactly.

703
00:44:06,348 --> 00:44:07,808
What are you doing here?

704
00:44:09,393 --> 00:44:10,394
I live here.

705
00:44:10,477 --> 00:44:12,271
Right, you live here…

706
00:44:12,354 --> 00:44:13,188
You live here?

707
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:19,403
You can put these on.

708
00:44:24,032 --> 00:44:26,410
So this is where you moved to.

709
00:44:29,955 --> 00:44:31,665
For a man living alone,

710
00:44:32,874 --> 00:44:33,959
it's perfect.

711
00:44:34,876 --> 00:44:36,211
Why is it so dark?

712
00:44:37,087 --> 00:44:37,963
Want some coffee?

713
00:44:38,046 --> 00:44:40,424
I'm on a diet.
Three creams and two sugars.

714
00:44:40,507 --> 00:44:43,301
You just said you're on a diet.
Just drink what I give you.

715
00:44:43,385 --> 00:44:45,178
Coffee's no good without cream and sugar.

716
00:44:47,055 --> 00:44:49,391
I have to review the documents.
Drink it and go.

717
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,817
By the way…

718
00:45:03,113 --> 00:45:05,907
I'm sorry I didn't buy you
a housewarming gift.

719
00:45:06,116 --> 00:45:07,200
That's right.

720
00:45:07,284 --> 00:45:09,661
Near here,
there's a great pig's trotters restaurant.

721
00:45:09,745 --> 00:45:12,164
Their spicy pig's trotters
are perfect with soju.

722
00:45:12,247 --> 00:45:13,999
I've decided to work overtime tonight.

723
00:45:14,541 --> 00:45:16,460
My wife will understand if I tell her.

724
00:45:17,044 --> 00:45:19,713
- Don't worry about anything.
- Who are you calling?

725
00:45:20,213 --> 00:45:21,715
I have documents to review.

726
00:45:21,798 --> 00:45:23,800
It looks like you're done. Get up.

727
00:45:24,509 --> 00:45:25,969
Take this with you.

728
00:45:26,678 --> 00:45:27,512
Go now?

729
00:45:27,596 --> 00:45:29,431
It's late. We have work tomorrow.

730
00:45:29,514 --> 00:45:30,974
No, I can spend the night.

731
00:45:31,058 --> 00:45:32,392
- It's fine.
- Don't be absurd.

732
00:45:32,476 --> 00:45:34,227
Why would you sleep here? Get up.

733
00:45:34,311 --> 00:45:36,730
- Hurry up and go.
- No, I can spend the night.

734
00:45:36,813 --> 00:45:38,356
- Please go.
- I can sleep anywhere.

735
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,483
- I can sleep here.
- Go.

736
00:45:39,566 --> 00:45:41,234
- But--
- It's urgent for me.

737
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:44,362
- Let's review them together.
- No, I'll do it alone.

738
00:45:49,743 --> 00:45:51,703
Don't come back
acting like you forgot something.

739
00:45:51,787 --> 00:45:52,662
It's so immature.

740
00:45:52,746 --> 00:45:54,581
What are you so obsessed about seeing?

741
00:45:56,291 --> 00:45:58,126
You're so cold-hearted!

742
00:46:03,799 --> 00:46:06,718
But why does he live here? How unsettling.

743
00:46:16,478 --> 00:46:17,646
Is this too much?

744
00:46:19,981 --> 00:46:20,816
LIM SUN

745
00:46:23,485 --> 00:46:24,945
Yes, I just got it.

746
00:46:25,028 --> 00:46:27,155
I'll look it over at home and call you.

747
00:46:36,706 --> 00:46:38,917
Whatever. It's not that much.

748
00:46:41,586 --> 00:46:44,589
Gosh, he's so cruel. So cold.

749
00:46:44,673 --> 00:46:46,716
That's why he's always alone after work.

750
00:46:47,634 --> 00:46:50,512
He'll end up old and alone
with a boring life.

751
00:46:52,931 --> 00:46:55,058
- Have a good night.
- Thank you. Come again.

752
00:46:55,142 --> 00:46:55,976
Thank you.

753
00:47:02,691 --> 00:47:05,068
The back of her head looks very familiar.

754
00:47:08,405 --> 00:47:11,741
I wish he'd eat pig's trotters with me.
It's too much to eat alone.

755
00:47:12,701 --> 00:47:16,079
I was going to sponge off of him
while pretending to be drunk.

756
00:47:16,997 --> 00:47:18,290
It's all ruined now.

757
00:47:22,169 --> 00:47:25,380
LIST OF SEOHAN CITY
MISSING PERSONS IN THE 2000S

758
00:47:40,896 --> 00:47:44,149
Mom!

759
00:47:44,858 --> 00:47:46,943
- Mom!
- Who let the kid in?

760
00:47:47,027 --> 00:47:48,445
- Get rid of him!
- Go!

761
00:47:48,528 --> 00:47:49,988
What about my mom?

762
00:47:50,071 --> 00:47:51,698
Mom!

763
00:48:14,763 --> 00:48:16,389
You can do this.

764
00:48:17,182 --> 00:48:18,475
It's okay.

765
00:48:18,558 --> 00:48:19,434
Okay.

766
00:48:21,645 --> 00:48:23,063
Okay, my dears. Take a look.

767
00:48:24,272 --> 00:48:25,357
Holy cow!

768
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,025
Doesn't my hair look so smooth?

769
00:48:27,108 --> 00:48:29,027
Did you buy that online and get scammed?

770
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:30,528
No. Be quiet.

771
00:48:31,988 --> 00:48:32,864
It's this.

772
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:34,616
How do I look?

773
00:48:34,699 --> 00:48:36,159
Come on!

774
00:48:38,495 --> 00:48:39,663
Hello, my dears!

775
00:48:39,746 --> 00:48:41,373
I have something to show you.

776
00:48:41,957 --> 00:48:42,791
Where did it go?

777
00:48:43,625 --> 00:48:45,335
I can do this. Okay.

778
00:48:53,677 --> 00:48:54,678
Come on.

779
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,809
What did you leave behind on purpose now?

780
00:49:00,892 --> 00:49:02,102
Hello.

781
00:49:02,185 --> 00:49:03,144
What brings you here?

782
00:49:03,228 --> 00:49:04,729
Were you with someone?

783
00:49:04,813 --> 00:49:05,647
No.

784
00:49:06,356 --> 00:49:07,607
What brings you here this late?

785
00:49:07,691 --> 00:49:08,858
Well…

786
00:49:08,942 --> 00:49:12,779
I wanted to resolve our misunderstanding
over some good food.

787
00:49:12,862 --> 00:49:14,281
- What misunderstanding?
- Well…

788
00:49:14,906 --> 00:49:18,076
It's about the incidents
at the chicken restaurant and hospital.

789
00:49:18,743 --> 00:49:20,245
It's okay. I already ate.

790
00:49:20,328 --> 00:49:22,706
- But I'm not okay.
- What?

791
00:49:22,789 --> 00:49:24,749
You invited me into your home too.

792
00:49:24,833 --> 00:49:27,043
I did? When?

793
00:49:27,544 --> 00:49:30,046
I was just so overwhelmed then.

794
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:32,048
I wasn't able to thank you properly

795
00:49:32,132 --> 00:49:33,508
on the night your door broke.

796
00:49:33,591 --> 00:49:34,968
That wasn't an invitation.

797
00:49:35,051 --> 00:49:37,262
You head-butted and kicked me.

798
00:49:37,345 --> 00:49:38,221
Okay, fine!

799
00:49:38,305 --> 00:49:42,434
Let's add that on
and talk openly about everything tonight.

800
00:49:42,517 --> 00:49:45,103
- Okay. Yes.
- Talk openly?

801
00:49:45,186 --> 00:49:47,314
As a sign of remorse,
I'll get the heavy one.

802
00:49:47,397 --> 00:49:49,524
- What are you doing? Seriously.
- Excuse me.

803
00:49:49,607 --> 00:49:51,026
You're doing this again!

804
00:49:51,109 --> 00:49:52,110
To the right.

805
00:49:52,861 --> 00:49:54,529
Go and eat with your friend.

806
00:49:54,612 --> 00:49:56,364
- I said I'm not hungry.
<i>- There it is!</i>

807
00:49:57,157 --> 00:49:58,783
I have documents to review.

808
00:50:05,457 --> 00:50:08,293
- Is your phone ringing?
- Right.

809
00:50:11,004 --> 00:50:12,213
Hey, Ga-yeong.

810
00:50:12,297 --> 00:50:13,214
Mi-jin.

811
00:50:13,298 --> 00:50:15,133
Buy me spicy pig's trotters
on your way back.

812
00:50:15,216 --> 00:50:18,261
Gosh, you already ate?

813
00:50:18,345 --> 00:50:21,473
Then, I have no choice
but to eat before I go to your place.

814
00:50:21,556 --> 00:50:23,266
What the hell are you saying?

815
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:25,602
I'm so hungry I could die.

816
00:50:25,685 --> 00:50:27,520
Buy me that super spicy pig's trotters.

817
00:50:28,438 --> 00:50:30,190
You're going to bed now?

818
00:50:30,273 --> 00:50:32,692
All right, you must be tired. Go to bed.

819
00:50:32,776 --> 00:50:35,695
Why would I sleep? I'm so hungry
that my hands are shaking!

820
00:50:35,779 --> 00:50:38,531
Buy me some spicy pig's trotters!
Is that so hard?

821
00:50:39,074 --> 00:50:40,533
What? She hung up?

822
00:50:41,785 --> 00:50:44,579
I slept all day.
Why does she want me to go to bed?

823
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:46,581
I'm so hungry.

824
00:50:48,166 --> 00:50:50,460
Your friend's going to bed?
It's not even 8 p.m.

825
00:50:50,543 --> 00:50:53,505
She usually goes to bed early.

826
00:50:53,588 --> 00:50:55,507
That's why.

827
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:57,175
She's an early bird.

828
00:50:57,926 --> 00:50:59,260
Yeah, that's it.

829
00:51:01,054 --> 00:51:01,971
Seriously, though.

830
00:51:05,392 --> 00:51:06,393
But…

831
00:51:08,269 --> 00:51:09,312
I brought friends.

832
00:51:10,271 --> 00:51:12,023
Ta-da!

833
00:51:15,068 --> 00:51:17,112
I didn't know you worked with Ko Won.

834
00:51:18,863 --> 00:51:20,657
Did he say I worked with him?

835
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:22,033
You don't?

836
00:51:23,243 --> 00:51:24,244
We did.

837
00:51:25,787 --> 00:51:27,831
But what kind of work do you do?

838
00:51:27,914 --> 00:51:29,374
Could you call that "work"?

839
00:51:30,834 --> 00:51:32,085
I wouldn't call it that.

840
00:51:33,044 --> 00:51:36,798
Anyway, I signed
a non-disclosure agreement.

841
00:51:37,382 --> 00:51:39,592
So I can't really tell you about it.

842
00:51:41,428 --> 00:51:42,429
Okay.

843
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,140
Drink it quick and go home.

844
00:51:45,223 --> 00:51:46,099
Go already?

845
00:51:46,182 --> 00:51:48,184
What? You want to spend the night again?

846
00:51:48,268 --> 00:51:50,270
No, it's not that.

847
00:51:50,937 --> 00:51:56,109
But I thought I can't just leave
after only drinking tea.

848
00:51:56,192 --> 00:51:57,193
Then, what would we do?

849
00:51:57,277 --> 00:51:58,528
Drink alcohol.

850
00:51:59,237 --> 00:52:00,238
I bought drinks.

851
00:52:01,281 --> 00:52:03,992
<i>Yeah, I'll get him drunk,
steal the documents, and run.</i>

852
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,246
Why would you suddenly come here to drink?

853
00:52:08,913 --> 00:52:12,750
Lately, I've had that stress…

854
00:52:13,334 --> 00:52:14,961
What was it called again?

855
00:52:15,044 --> 00:52:19,048
- Because of traumatic stress…
- Post-traumatic stress disorder?

856
00:52:19,632 --> 00:52:20,717
Because of that,

857
00:52:21,301 --> 00:52:23,428
I'm having a hard time.

858
00:52:23,511 --> 00:52:24,846
I have no one to talk to.

859
00:52:25,847 --> 00:52:28,600
Scary people keep showing up in my dreams.

860
00:52:28,683 --> 00:52:32,103
And I keep having these scary dreams,
so I'm having a hard time.

861
00:52:38,234 --> 00:52:39,277
Should I open the bottles?

862
00:52:43,573 --> 00:52:45,033
Cheers!

863
00:52:46,743 --> 00:52:48,077
Why am I the only one drinking?

864
00:52:56,961 --> 00:52:59,380
Gosh, you're a good drinker.

865
00:53:01,007 --> 00:53:02,926
Here you go.

866
00:53:03,009 --> 00:53:04,427
Splash!

867
00:53:04,511 --> 00:53:07,138
This is how fast I usually drink.

868
00:53:07,222 --> 00:53:08,264
Cheers!

869
00:53:08,348 --> 00:53:09,974
- This doesn't feel right.
- Why?

870
00:53:10,517 --> 00:53:13,520
- You're not drinking.
- Gosh. Yes, I am.

871
00:53:15,605 --> 00:53:18,233
But this place is just like a prosecutor.

872
00:53:18,733 --> 00:53:20,485
What does that mean?

873
00:53:21,027 --> 00:53:22,612
I mean, it's just like you.

874
00:53:22,695 --> 00:53:24,239
You wouldn't get it.

875
00:53:26,241 --> 00:53:27,075
What?

876
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:28,785
Danmuji!

877
00:53:29,994 --> 00:53:30,995
Wow.

878
00:53:32,121 --> 00:53:33,540
How do you know its name?

879
00:53:34,165 --> 00:53:34,999
What?

880
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,210
<i>What do I do?</i>

881
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,718
Ga-yeong's aunt showed me a picture of it.

882
00:53:46,386 --> 00:53:48,263
She was very fond of it.

883
00:53:49,097 --> 00:53:49,973
I see.

884
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,726
Didn't you want to drink though?

885
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:56,938
Right, I want to drink so bad.

886
00:53:59,148 --> 00:54:00,191
You didn't drink at all.

887
00:54:00,275 --> 00:54:02,527
What are you saying? I drank so much.

888
00:54:03,444 --> 00:54:04,696
I'm the only one who's…

889
00:54:04,779 --> 00:54:06,906
Look, this is because

890
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:11,035
I shouldn't get so drunk
and cause trouble like last time.

891
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:13,913
So after you've had your fill,

892
00:54:13,997 --> 00:54:15,999
I was going to drink comfortably then.

893
00:54:18,459 --> 00:54:19,586
But I don't get drunk.

894
00:54:22,797 --> 00:54:24,215
- You don't?
- No.

895
00:54:24,757 --> 00:54:27,719
- I've never been drunk before.
- Are you sure you've had alcohol before?

896
00:54:27,802 --> 00:54:28,970
How is that possible?

897
00:54:29,596 --> 00:54:31,764
I haven't met anyone
who could drink more than me.

898
00:54:32,473 --> 00:54:33,516
Wait.

899
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,268
How much can you drink?

900
00:54:35,351 --> 00:54:37,645
Like four or five bottles of soju?

901
00:54:38,187 --> 00:54:39,272
Four or five?

902
00:54:39,355 --> 00:54:41,190
"Four or five?" What?

903
00:54:43,776 --> 00:54:45,528
Then, you'll meet your match today.

904
00:54:45,612 --> 00:54:47,322
Someone who can outdrink you.

905
00:54:47,405 --> 00:54:48,239
Let's do this.

906
00:54:48,323 --> 00:54:50,908
You couldn't even
open your eyes properly last time.

907
00:54:51,451 --> 00:54:52,827
Last time,

908
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:57,248
that was because I emptied
my personal liquor pot before coming here.

909
00:54:58,333 --> 00:55:01,628
I can easily down
four or five bottles too.

910
00:55:01,711 --> 00:55:03,504
Why are you bluffing about this?

911
00:55:04,422 --> 00:55:07,133
<i>Ha! I knew this would happen,
so I came fully prepared.</i>

912
00:55:14,265 --> 00:55:15,850
Just you wait.

913
00:55:21,215 --> 00:55:25,094
I just liked you from the start.

914
00:55:25,969 --> 00:55:28,472
Wait a second.

915
00:55:28,555 --> 00:55:30,599
How could you suddenly say that?

916
00:55:30,683 --> 00:55:31,600
Goodness.

917
00:55:31,684 --> 00:55:34,687
I knew this day would come one day.

918
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:37,481
Have I thought about it?

919
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,692
I think I did.

920
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,901
I swear.

921
00:55:41,527 --> 00:55:42,611
Me?

922
00:55:43,654 --> 00:55:44,655
Gosh.

923
00:55:45,364 --> 00:55:47,866
May I ask about your parents?

924
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:48,992
They're not around.

925
00:55:50,285 --> 00:55:51,578
Here. Take this with you.

926
00:55:51,662 --> 00:55:53,330
- It's fine.
- Please.

927
00:55:53,414 --> 00:55:57,751
From now on,
saying "It's fine" will be prohibited.

928
00:55:57,835 --> 00:55:59,044
Here. Take it.

929
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:00,796
Thank you.

930
00:56:03,674 --> 00:56:06,510
When I tell people I'm an orphan,

931
00:56:08,095 --> 00:56:10,264
they usually make a face or look sad.

932
00:56:10,848 --> 00:56:12,558
They can't hide their expressions.

933
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,937
They say they're sorry or apologize to me.

934
00:56:17,855 --> 00:56:19,106
That's the norm.

935
00:56:20,482 --> 00:56:23,652
But I've never met anyone
who said it didn't matter.

936
00:56:27,239 --> 00:56:28,449
When I think about it,

937
00:56:30,409 --> 00:56:31,493
it's true.

938
00:56:33,078 --> 00:56:34,079
What is?

939
00:56:35,748 --> 00:56:36,874
To be honest…

940
00:56:40,711 --> 00:56:43,338
my mom was never really around.

941
00:56:45,549 --> 00:56:46,925
You know what I mean?

942
00:56:49,094 --> 00:56:50,721
I'm better off alone.

943
00:56:55,642 --> 00:56:57,478
Of course, it's not for the best.

944
00:56:57,561 --> 00:56:58,395
But at least,

945
00:56:59,772 --> 00:57:01,065
it hasn't been a bad life

946
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:03,859
despite not having parents.

947
00:57:06,195 --> 00:57:07,446
That's what came to mind.

948
00:57:09,823 --> 00:57:10,824
It was a first.

949
00:57:20,459 --> 00:57:21,460
Goodness.

950
00:57:22,377 --> 00:57:23,587
What?

951
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:24,671
What's that?

952
00:57:27,591 --> 00:57:28,842
Mi-jin!

953
00:57:28,926 --> 00:57:31,011
You should've told me you got these back!

954
00:57:31,512 --> 00:57:32,846
Jeez.

955
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,435
Gosh, my dear son-in-law!

956
00:57:39,061 --> 00:57:40,896
Look how cleanly he washed these!

957
00:57:50,489 --> 00:57:52,741
Goodness! What's this?

958
00:57:52,825 --> 00:57:54,201
Pieces of evidence?

959
00:57:54,701 --> 00:57:57,412
He definitely is a prosecutor. Goodness.

960
00:58:02,709 --> 00:58:04,837
- What's that?
- Hand lotion.

961
00:58:06,588 --> 00:58:09,550
Goodness, why did he send
something so expensive?

962
00:58:10,175 --> 00:58:11,593
- Doesn't it look expensive?
- Yeah.

963
00:58:12,427 --> 00:58:13,720
Let's see.

964
00:58:23,105 --> 00:58:24,481
- It smells nice.
- It does?

965
00:58:24,565 --> 00:58:25,566
Yeah.

966
00:58:27,609 --> 00:58:28,443
Goodness.

967
00:59:11,028 --> 00:59:12,779
Gosh, look at the time.

968
00:59:13,864 --> 00:59:15,199
I'll clean this up.

969
00:59:15,282 --> 00:59:16,992
No! Why? Already?

970
00:59:17,075 --> 00:59:18,702
No, I'll clean the table.

971
00:59:18,785 --> 00:59:19,703
No, it's fine.

972
00:59:19,786 --> 00:59:20,954
No, wait. Already?

973
00:59:21,038 --> 00:59:22,414
- Then--
- Stay seated.

974
00:59:22,497 --> 00:59:23,498
I'll clean…

975
00:59:26,043 --> 00:59:27,711
- Gosh, are you okay?
- No, let me--

976
00:59:27,794 --> 00:59:28,879
Don't touch it!

977
00:59:29,463 --> 00:59:30,881
Jeez, you're bleeding!

978
00:59:30,964 --> 00:59:32,758
- I'm okay.
- Get up.

979
00:59:33,425 --> 00:59:34,259
I'm so sorry.

980
00:59:34,343 --> 00:59:36,553
- Watch your feet.
- No, I'm fine.

981
00:59:36,637 --> 00:59:37,471
- Goodness.
- Sit here.

982
00:59:37,554 --> 00:59:38,847
Gosh, the shards are everywhere.

983
00:59:38,931 --> 00:59:40,641
- I'll look for ointment. Gosh.
- Okay.

984
00:59:40,724 --> 00:59:42,017
I'm so sorry.

985
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,645
- Keep your hand up to stop the bleeding.
- Okay.

986
00:59:49,983 --> 00:59:52,361
Are you always this clumsy? Well?

987
00:59:53,111 --> 00:59:54,947
Why are you so careless?

988
00:59:59,743 --> 01:00:02,412
Why put your body in harm's way
instead of protecting it?

989
01:00:03,121 --> 01:00:05,249
Jeez, where's that ointment?

990
01:00:07,709 --> 01:00:09,628
You did this at the restaurant too.

991
01:00:09,711 --> 01:00:13,131
She was twice your size.
Why would you take her on?

992
01:00:13,215 --> 01:00:14,299
She wasn't that big.

993
01:00:14,383 --> 01:00:16,134
- Still!
- I'm sorry.

994
01:00:16,218 --> 01:00:18,095
- And you're hurt now.
- I'm sorry.

995
01:00:22,516 --> 01:00:24,977
What if you get into an accident that way?

996
01:00:33,068 --> 01:00:34,569
What is it?

997
01:00:34,653 --> 01:00:36,989
- Ouch!
- What is it?

998
01:00:37,072 --> 01:00:39,283
It's starting to hurt a lot!
I need ointment!

999
01:00:39,366 --> 01:00:40,617
- Okay.
- Ointment! It's bleeding!

1000
01:00:40,701 --> 01:00:42,536
- Are you okay?
- Yes, thank you.

1001
01:00:51,003 --> 01:00:54,631
"Lim Suk." Lim Suk?

1002
01:00:55,215 --> 01:00:56,466
LIM SUK

1003
01:00:57,759 --> 01:00:58,677
Here it is.

1004
01:01:05,851 --> 01:01:06,768
Jeez.

1005
01:01:11,898 --> 01:01:13,150
- Let me see.
- Okay.

1006
01:01:14,192 --> 01:01:15,152
Thank you.

1007
01:01:16,528 --> 01:01:17,612
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1008
01:01:23,201 --> 01:01:24,870
- Does it sting?
- A little.

1009
01:01:48,685 --> 01:01:50,562
- Does it hurt?
- A little.

1010
01:01:51,271 --> 01:01:52,564
It's okay.

1011
01:01:59,863 --> 01:02:00,864
So…

1012
01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:02,324
Well…

1013
01:02:03,325 --> 01:02:06,536
What happens if someone was
temporarily insane due to alcohol?

1014
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:08,663
What?

1015
01:02:10,874 --> 01:02:12,501
Well, sentence reduction

1016
01:02:12,584 --> 01:02:15,253
will depend on whether the incident
was an accident or not.

1017
01:02:15,337 --> 01:02:16,171
I see.

1018
01:02:18,757 --> 01:02:20,175
Why?

1019
01:02:23,136 --> 01:02:24,888
Then, this isn't an accident.

1020
01:02:26,181 --> 01:02:27,349
What isn't an accident?

1021
01:03:15,063 --> 01:03:17,983
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

1022
01:03:18,066 --> 01:03:20,485
<i>But the mood was just…</i>

1023
01:03:20,569 --> 01:03:21,653
<i>What if…</i>

1024
01:03:22,362 --> 01:03:24,114
Ko Won confesses that he likes you?

1025
01:03:24,197 --> 01:03:26,158
- That didn't happen!
- It's just for fun!

1026
01:03:26,241 --> 01:03:27,784
How is this fun?

1027
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:29,911
<i>Are you saying they drowned?</i>

1028
01:03:29,995 --> 01:03:31,705
<i>Fentanyl was found in their blood.</i>

1029
01:03:31,788 --> 01:03:35,542
Are you saying the person
who killed the intern could be Dr. Baek?

1030
01:03:35,625 --> 01:03:37,169
<i>Let's dig into Baek Cheol-gyu.</i>

1031
01:03:37,252 --> 01:03:38,795
My stomach!

1032
01:03:38,879 --> 01:03:42,215
<i>We must find any potential evidence
before it's hidden.</i>

1033
01:03:42,757 --> 01:03:46,261
<i>Lim Sun, who are you?</i>
