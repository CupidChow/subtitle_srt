DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

7
00:00:40,391 --> 00:00:44,103
I've waited for so long
after you disappeared 24 years ago.

8
00:00:46,105 --> 00:00:47,773
I waited for you to reappear.

00:00:57,325 --> 00:00:59,952
WIFE

13
00:01:01,537 --> 00:01:03,122
You want to report your wife missing?

14
00:01:03,205 --> 00:01:04,040
Yes.

15
00:01:04,123 --> 00:01:08,294
So you're saying your wife
hasn't been home for a week now, right?

16
00:01:08,377 --> 00:01:09,545
Yes.

17
00:01:09,628 --> 00:01:11,547
But why are you reporting it now?

18
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:14,008
If you report an adult missing right away,

19
00:01:14,717 --> 00:01:16,635
they'll just be reported as a runaway.

20
00:01:18,596 --> 00:01:20,890
I checked all
of her credit card transactions.

21
00:01:20,973 --> 00:01:24,060
Strangely, no transactions
were made after she disappeared.

22
00:01:24,143 --> 00:01:25,478
No calls were made either.

23
00:01:26,187 --> 00:01:27,480
What does that mean?

24
00:01:27,563 --> 00:01:29,565
There's no sign of everyday activities.

25
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:30,566
Anything else?

26
00:01:31,317 --> 00:01:32,193
Also,

27
00:01:32,276 --> 00:01:34,987
I confirmed
she frequently visited motels.

28
00:01:35,071 --> 00:01:36,113
DAEHO MOTEL

29
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:38,991
It seems she continuously met someone

30
00:01:39,075 --> 00:01:41,077
at these motels.

31
00:01:41,952 --> 00:01:44,163
It's about money in most crimes.

32
00:01:44,246 --> 00:01:45,164
CALIFORNIA DREAM MOTEL

33
00:01:45,247 --> 00:01:48,834
This has a similar pattern
to kidnapping and missing persons cases.

34
00:01:48,918 --> 00:01:51,921
You should check her bank accounts first.

35
00:01:54,924 --> 00:01:57,593
Gosh. It's been so long, Director Baek.

36
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,513
I have a favor to ask of you, Ms. Lim.

37
00:02:00,596 --> 00:02:02,390
Sure. Have a seat.

38
00:02:03,849 --> 00:02:04,684
This.

39
00:02:05,309 --> 00:02:06,686
It's my wife's old account.

40
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:07,687
KANG GYEONG-HUI

41
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,439
If someone tries
to withdraw money from this account,

42
00:02:10,523 --> 00:02:11,399
please call me.

43
00:02:14,443 --> 00:02:15,403
Goodness.

44
00:02:15,486 --> 00:02:17,863
I'm asking because I know I can trust you.

45
00:02:17,947 --> 00:02:18,823
Please.

46
00:02:20,783 --> 00:02:22,076
Please help me out.

47
00:02:28,165 --> 00:02:30,334
LIM SUN

48
00:02:33,796 --> 00:02:35,840
All the way straight! Okay!

49
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,007
Goodness.

50
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:38,300
Hold on.

51
00:02:39,051 --> 00:02:40,511
We identified the victim.

52
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:43,722
It's Kang Gyeong-hui, the wife
of Hwadong Medical Center's director.

53
00:02:45,057 --> 00:02:46,517
Hwadong Medical Center…

54
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:49,061
Dr. Baek Cheol-gyu?

55
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:55,985
Mr. Baek Cheol-gyu.

56
00:02:56,068 --> 00:02:58,612
You're under arrest
for the murder of Kang Gyeong-hui.

57
00:02:58,696 --> 00:03:00,156
You have the right to remain silent.

58
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,784
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

59
00:03:03,868 --> 00:03:06,454
So your wife didn't come home
the day before,

60
00:03:06,537 --> 00:03:08,539
but you just went home and rested?

61
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:11,292
I thought she'd be back like before.

62
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:14,837
That means this wasn't the first time
she's left home without warning.

63
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,715
Were you and your wife
experiencing any troubles…

64
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:21,510
Shouldn't you go out and catch the culprit
instead of doing this?

65
00:03:21,594 --> 00:03:23,429
Yes, we should.

66
00:03:24,388 --> 00:03:25,848
But if we want to catch them,

67
00:03:26,474 --> 00:03:29,477
we need to confirm
if you really were at home

68
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,312
on that day.

69
00:03:31,896 --> 00:03:33,606
Are you saying I did it?

70
00:03:35,232 --> 00:03:39,528
You reported your wife missing
after she had been gone for a week.

71
00:03:39,612 --> 00:03:41,030
On the day before she disappeared…

72
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:45,701
- You two fought, right?
- Of course not!

73
00:03:45,785 --> 00:03:47,161
My wife is dead!

74
00:03:47,244 --> 00:03:49,789
And it's killing me right now!

75
00:03:49,872 --> 00:03:52,666
But what did you say to me?
I'm the culprit?

76
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:56,754
SEOHAN PROVINCIAL POLICE AGENCY

77
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:59,840
<i>Your alibi checks out,
so we're releasing you.</i>

78
00:03:59,924 --> 00:04:02,468
<i>But you haven't been ruled out
as a suspect yet.</i>

THREE MISSED CALLS
SEOHAN BANK LIM SUN

80
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:11,936
<i>The number you've dialed is unavailable--</i>

81
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:18,359
Hello, Seohan Bank? Ms. Lim…

82
00:04:18,442 --> 00:04:21,570
I mean, I'd like to speak with Lim Sun.

83
00:04:21,654 --> 00:04:23,489
<i>Ms. Lim has resigned.</i>

84
00:04:24,114 --> 00:04:25,199
Wait a minute!

85
00:04:25,282 --> 00:04:28,118
She was working there recently.
What do you mean she resigned?

86
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:31,455
I looked into her colleagues,
friends, and old classmates,

87
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:33,541
but Lim Sun has just vanished.

88
00:04:33,624 --> 00:04:35,167
What do you mean by that?

89
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:38,212
Well, when you gave her
the bankbook that day,

90
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:40,130
she must've figured it out and fled.

91
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:43,759
Are you saying Lim Sun could be
the culprit who killed my wife?

92
00:04:43,843 --> 00:04:45,261
Or she could be working with them.

93
00:04:46,929 --> 00:04:48,556
In any case, I'm certain

94
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,475
that Lim Sun is closely linked
to your wife's case.

95
00:04:52,852 --> 00:04:55,688
Do whatever you can to find Lim Sun.

96
00:04:55,771 --> 00:04:58,023
If she's deliberately hiding,
it'll be very hard--

97
00:04:58,107 --> 00:05:01,569
I don't care how much it costs
or how long it takes.

98
00:05:01,652 --> 00:05:04,280
You must find her for me.
Do whatever it takes.

99
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:07,700

<i>I've been looking for you for decades.</i>

102
00:05:12,955 --> 00:05:15,874
<i>I gathered
all the information I could on you.</i>

103
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,043
<i>Family and medical records. Everything.</i>

104
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:21,088
<i>I looked through every last trace of you.</i>

105
00:05:21,171 --> 00:05:22,339
<i>And I kept digging.</i>

106
00:05:22,965 --> 00:05:23,841
<i>But…</i>

107
00:05:24,508 --> 00:05:26,135
<i>I couldn't find you.</i>

108
00:05:26,885 --> 00:05:28,929
<i>As time went by, I grew anxious.</i>

109
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,808
<i>If I couldn't find you,
it would all be over.</i>

110
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:34,018
EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH
LIM SUN

111
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:36,645
<i>I couldn't let that happen. I wouldn't.</i>

112
00:05:37,646 --> 00:05:41,400
<i>I waited for so long to find you.</i>

113
00:05:44,153 --> 00:05:47,197
After I lost my wife,
I drowned myself in alcohol

114
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:48,657
and even became sick.

115
00:05:48,741 --> 00:05:50,868
So overnight, I was banned from surgeries.

116
00:05:52,828 --> 00:05:54,246
I lost everything!

117
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,916
My family! My reputation! Everything!

118
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:07,343
No. It wasn't me.

119
00:06:07,426 --> 00:06:08,886
It wasn't me.

120
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,804
The only person who can tell me

121
00:06:10,888 --> 00:06:13,432
why my wife died, how she died,
and who killed her

122
00:06:13,515 --> 00:06:15,851
is you, Lim Sun.

123
00:06:15,934 --> 00:06:17,895
I'm not Lim Sun!

124
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:20,606
Even if you're impersonating
the real Lim Sun,

125
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:22,941
you know for sure who she is.

126
00:06:23,025 --> 00:06:25,277
If not, it makes no sense

127
00:06:25,361 --> 00:06:28,322
for you to steal her identity
to enter the prosecutor's office.

128
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:30,741
Sure, let's grab a bite sometime.

129
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:32,951
Yes, okay.

130
00:06:34,036 --> 00:06:35,037
Goodbye.

131
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:39,416
Hello?

132
00:06:42,586 --> 00:06:44,213
You found Lim Sun?

133
00:06:50,302 --> 00:06:51,553
Do you recognize her?

134
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:54,765
Not at all. It's been decades.

135
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:57,518
What are you going to do?

136
00:06:58,978 --> 00:07:00,854
I'll take it from here.

137
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,317
So you're saying

138
00:07:05,401 --> 00:07:08,153
I just have to get this woman
to come to the hospital?

139
00:07:08,237 --> 00:07:10,072
Her face will be scratched up a bit.

140
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:11,740
Don't hurt her too badly.

141
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:15,494
She has to be brought in one piece.
Can you do it?

142
00:07:16,453 --> 00:07:17,287
Don't worry.

143
00:07:17,913 --> 00:07:19,540
If this goes smoothly,

144
00:07:19,623 --> 00:07:22,418
the next fentanyl shipment
won't be an issue. Right, Director?

145
00:07:37,141 --> 00:07:39,727
ACID ATTACKER CAUGHT BY 50-YEAR-OLD

146
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:53,032
Mr. Mayor, it's Dr. Baek
from Hwadong Medical Center.

147
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:57,619
Yes, I was hoping we could grab a meal.

148
00:07:57,703 --> 00:08:00,247
- I'm honored to work with you.
- Thank you.

149
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:03,876
If you're curious or have questions
about anything, you can ask me.

150
00:08:04,501 --> 00:08:06,003
I'm the youngest one here.

151
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:08,964
You are quite young
for a senior public intern.

152
00:08:09,048 --> 00:08:10,591
That's a great smile too.

153
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,261
I impersonated her.

154
00:08:14,344 --> 00:08:16,597
As you said, I've lived for decades

155
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,390
quietly and in complete secrecy.

156
00:08:19,016 --> 00:08:22,686
I had absolutely no idea
I'd run into anyone like this.

157
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,605
Still refusing to talk?

158
00:08:24,688 --> 00:08:28,692
There's nothing I can tell you! I swear!

159
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:31,361
I never expected you to tell me so easily.

160
00:08:33,363 --> 00:08:34,782
Please, believe me!

161
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:42,748
I'll make you talk
even if I have to numb your mind.

162
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:44,917
But…

163
00:08:49,088 --> 00:08:50,923
<i>How long have I been trapped here?</i>

164
00:08:51,006 --> 00:08:53,092
<i>It was around 4:00 p.m.
when I was brought here.</i>

165
00:08:54,343 --> 00:08:56,804
<i>Has the sun set yet?
It's going to get dark soon.</i>

166
00:09:04,853 --> 00:09:07,314
Wait! Wait a second!

167
00:09:08,232 --> 00:09:11,318
Wait! I'll prove it!

168
00:09:12,444 --> 00:09:13,445
I'll prove it.

169
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:15,447
I'll prove that I'm not Lim Sun.

170
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,367
I can show you who I am.

171
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,245
Please!

172
00:09:21,745 --> 00:09:22,704
We don't have to leave.

173
00:09:23,413 --> 00:09:24,873
Please believe me. Just once.

174
00:09:24,957 --> 00:09:27,960
I'll prove it to you right here.

175
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:32,965
Please.

176
00:09:45,978 --> 00:09:46,895
Mr. Gye!

177
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,731
The raid's over. Why are you here?

178
00:09:49,815 --> 00:09:51,400
I'm looking for someone.

179
00:09:51,483 --> 00:09:52,401
Is it Ms. Lim?

180
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:53,861
What about her?

181
00:09:53,944 --> 00:09:55,988
She suddenly disappeared
while we were working.

182
00:09:56,613 --> 00:09:57,698
I'm sure she'll call.

183
00:09:57,781 --> 00:09:59,658
Anyway, I'm looking for someone.
See you later.

184
00:09:59,741 --> 00:10:01,326
What? But Mr. Gye…

185
00:10:01,952 --> 00:10:02,953
Mr. Gye!

186
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,456
Who is he looking for?
Why is he running off so frantically?

187
00:10:20,637 --> 00:10:21,638
MI-JIN

188
00:10:24,516 --> 00:10:25,392
What is this?

189
00:10:25,475 --> 00:10:27,352
Have these with you just in case.

190
00:10:52,002 --> 00:10:53,086
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

191
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:13,941

192
00:11:14,483 --> 00:11:16,652
<i>Request backup
to the basement storage room.</i>

193
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:31,708
<i>That's strange. Why won't I change?</i>

194
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:34,169
Your time's up.

195
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,840
You had your chance to prove
you weren't Lim Sun,

196
00:11:39,424 --> 00:11:40,801
and it's over now.

197
00:11:40,884 --> 00:11:42,636
What time is it right now?

198
00:11:43,428 --> 00:11:45,973
Maybe the sun's still up. It has to set.

HWADONG MEDICAL CENTER

200
00:12:00,862 --> 00:12:01,947
Damn it!

201
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:06,034
Sir! The sun could set late!

202
00:12:06,118 --> 00:12:07,119
Please!

203
00:12:32,436 --> 00:12:33,478
Lee Mi-jin!

204
00:12:35,147 --> 00:12:35,981
Mr. Gye?

205
00:12:36,648 --> 00:12:38,608
Over here! I'm over here!

206
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:49,911
Are you okay?

207
00:12:50,454 --> 00:12:51,538
Behind you!

208
00:13:04,634 --> 00:13:07,054
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

209
00:13:26,698 --> 00:13:27,741
Mr. Gye!

210
00:13:31,286 --> 00:13:32,120
Don't.

211
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,584
Don't do it.

212
00:13:56,645 --> 00:13:57,771
Are you okay?

213
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:17,374
It's okay.

214
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,084
I'm here now.

215
00:14:30,095 --> 00:14:32,389
Mi-jin?

216
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,352
Mr. Gye, what's going on…

217
00:14:42,858 --> 00:14:44,818
We have people injured
in Hwadong's basement.

218
00:14:44,901 --> 00:14:46,486
Yes, the basement storage room! Hurry!

00:15:15,891 --> 00:15:16,975
Mr. Gye.

222
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:18,560
Are you awake?

223
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,521
Please don't call my parents.

224
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,442
Okay. Hold on. We're almost there.

225
00:15:33,575 --> 00:15:35,076
SUSPECT INTERROGATION FORM

226
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,340
There are many watchful eyes.

227
00:15:48,423 --> 00:15:51,426
That's why we've brought you
here to the prosecutors' office.

228
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,969
So we ask that you cooperate.

229
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:59,434
A vehicle hanging around
the victim's house

230
00:15:59,518 --> 00:16:02,020
was also spotted on CCTV
near the hospital.

231
00:16:04,147 --> 00:16:06,942
After hiring someone to watch Lee Mi-jin,
you kidnapped her, right?

232
00:16:11,613 --> 00:16:12,656
Who?

233
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:20,413
You're the one who kidnapped her.
Did you forget already?

234
00:16:20,497 --> 00:16:21,790
Ms. Lee Mi-jin.

235
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:56,533
Are you okay?

236
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:58,201
Mr. Gye.

237
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:01,413
- How do you feel?
- I'm okay.

238
00:17:07,877 --> 00:17:08,837
Were you hurt?

239
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:12,674
It's just a scratch.

240
00:17:13,758 --> 00:17:15,677
You should have it treated right away.

241
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,013
It's no big deal.

242
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,515
Worry about yourself. Look at this.

243
00:17:23,184 --> 00:17:24,352
That must've hurt.

244
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:29,899
Does it hurt?

245
00:17:32,694 --> 00:17:33,737
Ms. Lee Mi-jin…

246
00:17:34,237 --> 00:17:37,115
I mean, the victim's blood
has been sent to NFS.

247
00:17:37,198 --> 00:17:40,452
Fortunately, she's not hallucinating,
so it wasn't a narcotic.

248
00:17:40,535 --> 00:17:41,786
And Baek Cheol-gyu?

249
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,371
The perpetrator isn't talking,

250
00:17:43,455 --> 00:17:46,124
and it just so happens
the victim can't remember anything.

251
00:17:52,547 --> 00:17:54,883
Is there anything else
you'd like to tell me?

252
00:17:58,136 --> 00:18:02,223
To be honest, Lee Mi-jin
is a witness in Ko Na-heun's murder case.

253
00:18:02,307 --> 00:18:03,308
Excuse me?

254
00:18:04,976 --> 00:18:08,480
But that wasn't
in the case file when we got it.

255
00:18:08,563 --> 00:18:10,357
I purposely didn't tell the police.

256
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,399
Why not?

257
00:18:13,276 --> 00:18:15,945
I should've done whatever I could
to catch him before.

258
00:18:19,074 --> 00:18:21,743
Lee Mi-jin is a witness in a murder case.

259
00:18:21,826 --> 00:18:23,453
And if Baek's the culprit…

260
00:18:24,287 --> 00:18:26,539
I see. I get it now.

261
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,085
Baek Cheol-gyu did say something though.

262
00:18:30,168 --> 00:18:32,253
He said he didn't kidnap Lee Mi-jin.

263
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,298
He's denying his crime. Utter nonsense.

264
00:18:38,635 --> 00:18:40,303
If you denied committing a crime,

265
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:42,681
wouldn't you say
you didn't kidnap anyone at all?

266
00:18:44,683 --> 00:18:48,645
So he admits to kidnapping someone,
but it wasn't Lee Mi-jin.

267
00:18:49,312 --> 00:18:50,313
Is that it?

268
00:18:55,026 --> 00:18:56,319
Cover yourself with this.

269
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:58,863
The car's not warm yet,
so it's cold. Be careful.

270
00:19:14,629 --> 00:19:17,966
From the first time we met and even now,

271
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:20,593
you're always saving me.

272
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,306
I'm sorry. I couldn't keep my promise.

273
00:19:26,391 --> 00:19:28,560
I should've protected you at all costs.

274
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:31,604
I should've locked him up
before this happened.

275
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,606
<i>Does he still not know?</i>

276
00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:37,527
<i>If Baek Cheol-gyu talked, he'd know.</i>

277
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:40,905
Baek Cheol-gyu won't talk.

278
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:45,869
So your statement is important,

279
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:48,496
but there's no need
to force yourself to remember.

280
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,832
The most important thing
is that you feel at ease.

281
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:55,170
The only person who can tell me

282
00:19:55,253 --> 00:19:57,756
why my wife died, how she died,
and who killed her

283
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:59,716
is you, Lim Sun.

284
00:20:04,888 --> 00:20:07,724
- Mr. Gye?
- Yes?

285
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:12,187
I don't think
Baek Cheol-gyu's the culprit.

286
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:18,234
We can't be sure about anything yet.

287
00:20:19,569 --> 00:20:20,862
Whether he's the culprit or not,

288
00:20:20,945 --> 00:20:22,906
we'll conduct an investigation
to find out.

289
00:20:23,698 --> 00:20:24,866
So for now,

290
00:20:24,949 --> 00:20:27,410
don't think about anything and rest. Okay?

291
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:30,205
Okay.

292
00:20:30,705 --> 00:20:32,665
- Put your seat belt on. Let's go.
- Okay.

293
00:20:44,552 --> 00:20:45,595
Lift your foot.

294
00:20:49,974 --> 00:20:51,100
Did you hear?

295
00:20:51,726 --> 00:20:52,727
About what?

296
00:20:54,062 --> 00:20:55,897
Director Baek was arrested.

297
00:20:56,564 --> 00:20:57,440
What?

298
00:20:57,524 --> 00:20:59,484
Goodness gracious.

299
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:01,945
I guess a disaster did happen after all.

300
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:02,862
My goodness.

301
00:21:02,946 --> 00:21:04,030
I don't believe this.

302
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:05,532
Goodness.

303
00:21:06,282 --> 00:21:07,951
It seems like you know something.

304
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,786
Please tell us.

305
00:21:11,996 --> 00:21:14,374
It's not related
to Ko Na-heun's death, is it?

306
00:21:14,457 --> 00:21:18,127
Why do you keep trying to link
Ko Na-heun's case with this?

307
00:21:18,211 --> 00:21:21,172
- It's ridiculous.
- I'm not the only one who's thinking it.

308
00:21:21,256 --> 00:21:24,342
I heard Baek Cheol-gyu
killed his own wife.

309
00:21:24,425 --> 00:21:26,427
- He killed his wife?
- Yeah.

310
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:28,805
My goodness.

311
00:21:29,514 --> 00:21:33,768
The most normal-looking people
are the most sinister on the inside!

312
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:35,854
Goodness.

313
00:21:35,937 --> 00:21:38,606
It's like he waited for Ko Na-heun
to leave so he could join.

314
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:40,108
I knew it was strange.

315
00:21:40,191 --> 00:21:41,693
Did he come to investigate the case?

316
00:21:41,776 --> 00:21:43,862
Don't go around
ignorantly spreading rumors.

317
00:21:43,945 --> 00:21:45,780
Just get back to work! Come on.

318
00:21:45,864 --> 00:21:47,448
What? "Ignorantly"?

319
00:21:47,532 --> 00:21:50,034
Well, how else would you describe it then?

320
00:21:50,118 --> 00:21:51,619
- "Ignorantly"?
- Lower your voices!

321
00:21:51,703 --> 00:21:54,497
You rude punk!
Why do you always speak like that?

322
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:56,124
Why do you talk so rudely?

323
00:21:56,207 --> 00:21:57,834
- Goodness!
- Why?

324
00:21:58,501 --> 00:21:59,460
Sun, are you okay?

325
00:22:00,128 --> 00:22:01,212
What?

326
00:22:02,255 --> 00:22:04,299
You look terrible.

327
00:22:04,966 --> 00:22:05,800
I'm fine.

328
00:22:06,384 --> 00:22:08,595
Did you hear
about Director Baek Cheol-gyu?

329
00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:13,266
They say he's the one
who killed Ko Na-heun.

330
00:22:13,349 --> 00:22:14,309
Who said that?

331
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:16,311
The rumors have already spread!

332
00:22:16,394 --> 00:22:18,771
He had an ulterior motive for coming here.

333
00:22:18,855 --> 00:22:19,856
How terrifying.

334
00:22:20,481 --> 00:22:22,900
How terrifying! My goodness!

335
00:22:50,053 --> 00:22:52,930
Ms. Lim doesn't even drink those,
so I'll help myself.

336
00:22:53,931 --> 00:22:55,975
You shouldn't drink what's not yours.

337
00:22:57,894 --> 00:22:59,687
He's been loitering here for a few days.

338
00:22:59,771 --> 00:23:01,606
Do you think they already broke up?

339
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,316
What do you mean?

340
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,902
Ko Won and Ms. Lim.

341
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:07,654
Right, so what about them?

342
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:10,782
I told you last time.

343
00:23:10,865 --> 00:23:11,908
What?

344
00:23:15,203 --> 00:23:16,579
<i>Did you know too, Mr. Gye?</i>

345
00:23:16,663 --> 00:23:18,247
About the person he likes.

346
00:23:20,249 --> 00:23:23,086
The feelings are mutual,
so how can you stop them, right?

347
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,171
They're mutual?

348
00:23:25,254 --> 00:23:30,134
Yes, I thought it was one-sided at first,
but it seems to have become mutual.

349
00:23:34,806 --> 00:23:35,890
So you're saying

350
00:23:35,973 --> 00:23:38,935
Ko Won and Ms. Lim are dating?

351
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:41,187
Who the hell said that nonsense?

352
00:23:44,941 --> 00:23:47,902
It wasn't me. Mr. Ju said…

353
00:23:47,985 --> 00:23:50,780
Hey, didn't you take the morning off?
Why are you so early?

354
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:52,699
Where did you hear such nonsense?

355
00:23:52,782 --> 00:23:55,535
You've got to be kidding me!
Unbelievable!

356
00:23:55,618 --> 00:23:57,745
- I can't even speak!
- Are you okay?

357
00:23:57,829 --> 00:23:59,872
No. I mean, it's okay.

358
00:23:59,956 --> 00:24:00,790
I mean,

359
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:02,583
you have to chase down those fools

360
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:05,128
who spew nonsense like that
and slug them in the ear!

361
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:09,841
I'll pluck their ribs out and turn them
into a xylophone to play on!

362
00:24:10,717 --> 00:24:12,927
You can go home
if you're not feeling well.

363
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:13,970
I'm fine.

364
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:15,304
Gosh, I'm so mad. My head!

365
00:24:15,847 --> 00:24:18,558
- My head.
- What's wrong with your hand?

366
00:24:18,641 --> 00:24:20,810
I played a game with my nieces
that had punishments.

367
00:24:21,686 --> 00:24:23,521
<i>About the person he likes.</i>

368
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:31,362
Why are you laughing?

369
00:24:31,446 --> 00:24:32,780
No, I'm not laughing.

370
00:24:33,364 --> 00:24:34,574
Hold on.

371
00:24:34,657 --> 00:24:36,075
You're laughing at me right now.

372
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,119
- I'm not!
- Seriously.

373
00:24:38,202 --> 00:24:39,662
You're so annoying!

374
00:24:39,746 --> 00:24:41,581
I've never seen him laugh like that.

375
00:24:42,165 --> 00:24:44,125
Mr. Ju, look.

376
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:46,794
Who said that rumor
about Ko Won and me? Tell me.

377
00:24:47,503 --> 00:24:48,337
To be honest,

378
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:51,132
you two feed each other,
ride home together after work,

379
00:24:51,215 --> 00:24:53,426
and gift each other vitamins.
That's what I heard.

380
00:24:53,509 --> 00:24:54,844
- It's what I heard.
- I see.

381
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:56,179
- I bet it was you!
- No!

382
00:24:56,262 --> 00:24:57,680
- Come here.
- No, I heard it.

383
00:24:57,764 --> 00:24:59,182
- It's okay. Come here.
- Mr. Gye.

384
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:00,558
- Jeez, let's go.
- Mr. Gye.

385
00:25:00,641 --> 00:25:02,810
- I support you two!
- Could you hold down the fort?

386
00:25:02,894 --> 00:25:04,687
Mr. Gye! No! Wait!

387
00:25:08,441 --> 00:25:09,567
So that's what it was.

388
00:25:10,026 --> 00:25:10,860
Gosh.

389
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:13,196
I had no idea.

390
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,363
Gosh.

391
00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:16,282
That was enough laughs for the year.

392
00:25:20,328 --> 00:25:22,872
You've been coming straight home
after work lately.

393
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:25,416
I'm so proud of you.
You're so ambitious.

394
00:25:26,793 --> 00:25:29,545
Coming straight home is the problem.

395
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:31,047
You should be busy dating

396
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,882
or at least getting to know some guys.

397
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:35,259
But after work,
you lock yourself up at home.

398
00:25:35,343 --> 00:25:38,721
How is always having dinner
with your parents ambitious?

399
00:25:38,805 --> 00:25:40,681
Even if she's not ambitious,

400
00:25:40,765 --> 00:25:43,059
it's very inspiring
from a family harmony standpoint.

401
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:44,018
"Inspiring"?

402
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,103
I'll do the dishes.

403
00:25:46,187 --> 00:25:48,231
Go to your room
and put a sheet mask on instead.

404
00:25:48,314 --> 00:25:50,525
What's with your face? It looks rough.

405
00:25:51,317 --> 00:25:53,945
You do the dishes, honey.
Do them inspiringly.

406
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:55,988
Thanks for dinner.

407
00:25:56,948 --> 00:25:58,783
I planned on doing them inspiringly.

408
00:26:05,456 --> 00:26:07,750
Mi-jin! Here. Answer the phone.

409
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:09,168
It's Mr. Gye!

410
00:26:09,877 --> 00:26:11,045
Come on! Take it!

411
00:26:11,128 --> 00:26:12,630
No, I don't need to answer it now.

412
00:26:12,713 --> 00:26:13,840
Hurry!

413
00:26:27,812 --> 00:26:28,896
What brings you here?

414
00:26:29,397 --> 00:26:32,108
This is tea. They say it helps you sleep.

415
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:33,401
Try drinking some before bed.

416
00:26:36,571 --> 00:26:37,905
Is this why you came here?

417
00:26:39,073 --> 00:26:39,907
Also,

418
00:26:39,991 --> 00:26:42,368
you know the drugs
Baek injected you with?

419
00:26:42,952 --> 00:26:46,581
It turns out it was just a muscle relaxant
commonly used in the hospital.

420
00:26:46,664 --> 00:26:48,332
So you don't have to worry.

421
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:49,876
I see. Okay.

422
00:26:51,252 --> 00:26:53,129
You could've told me over the phone.

423
00:26:53,963 --> 00:26:56,716
Still, I wanted to see you in person

424
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,886
and came to make sure that you were okay.

425
00:27:01,554 --> 00:27:02,555
You're okay, right?

426
00:27:02,638 --> 00:27:05,057
Yeah, I'm okay.

427
00:27:06,517 --> 00:27:08,811
Well, since I got to see you, I'll go now.

428
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:13,858
Take care.

429
00:27:18,946 --> 00:27:20,698
It's cold. Go inside.

430
00:27:20,781 --> 00:27:22,992
I will. Thanks for the tea.

431
00:27:24,201 --> 00:27:25,036
You're welcome.

432
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:42,637
<i>Hey, those are provocative words.</i>

433
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,638
<i>What's with you?</i>

434
00:27:54,565 --> 00:27:56,067
So what happened?

435
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:58,444
Why did he come? What is it this time?

436
00:27:59,528 --> 00:28:00,738
Tea.

437
00:28:01,614 --> 00:28:02,573
Tea?

438
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,534
- Like what you brew and drink?
- Yeah.

439
00:28:05,618 --> 00:28:07,954
- He came here at night to give you that?
- Yeah.

440
00:28:08,704 --> 00:28:12,500
Goodness, he's making up
all types of excuses, isn't he? Gosh.

441
00:28:12,583 --> 00:28:13,709
Did anything else happen?

442
00:28:14,377 --> 00:28:15,378
No!

443
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:17,964
- What? I like tea.
- Me too.

444
00:28:20,091 --> 00:28:22,551
I swear, you two are like peas in a pod.

445
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,930
Hey, you brat! If you like him,

446
00:28:26,013 --> 00:28:27,265
why can't you tell him?

447
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:28,933
Gosh, you're so frustrating!

448
00:28:29,016 --> 00:28:30,768
That's because of your menopause.

449
00:28:34,272 --> 00:28:35,231
Yummy.

450
00:28:51,247 --> 00:28:52,623
Over here!

451
00:28:57,295 --> 00:28:58,379
I'm over here!

452
00:28:59,714 --> 00:29:00,798
Don't do it.

453
00:29:07,638 --> 00:29:09,432
- No!
- Die!

454
00:30:18,459 --> 00:30:20,961
<i>Baek Cheol-gyu won't talk.</i>

455
00:30:21,045 --> 00:30:24,048
<i>So your statement is important,</i>

456
00:30:24,131 --> 00:30:26,634
<i>but there's no need
to force yourself to remember.</i>

457
00:30:26,717 --> 00:30:29,345
<i>The most important thing
is that you feel at ease.</i>

458
00:30:36,852 --> 00:30:39,563
<i>If Baek Cheol-gyu keeps quiet,
what will happen then?</i>

459
00:30:42,733 --> 00:30:44,777
<i>What if they can't catch the culprit?</i>

460
00:31:01,836 --> 00:31:05,172
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

461
00:31:09,927 --> 00:31:11,804
The only person who can tell me

462
00:31:11,887 --> 00:31:14,557
why my wife died, how she died,
and who killed her

463
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,559
is you, Lim Sun.

464
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:21,480
He won't budge.

465
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,693
Did Baek Cheol-gyu refuse
to give a statement again?

466
00:31:26,569 --> 00:31:27,403
He's very resolute.

467
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:29,488
He won't even drink any water.

468
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:31,449
The silver lining is

469
00:31:31,532 --> 00:31:35,077
the high-powered legal team
we expected hasn't shown up yet.

470
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,416
Maybe he isn't the culprit.

471
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,334
What?

472
00:31:42,418 --> 00:31:43,586
If that's the case,

473
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:46,505
won't we miss our chance
to catch the real culprit?

474
00:31:50,259 --> 00:31:52,386
He's invoking his right to remain silent.

475
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:55,139
Won't it be faster
to raid Club Hovan and investigate?

476
00:31:55,222 --> 00:31:57,808
He can get at least a ten-year sentence
for distributing drugs.

477
00:31:57,892 --> 00:31:59,810
If we mess up
and it backfires, it's all over.

478
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:06,525
We just need Baek Cheol-gyu's statement.

479
00:32:14,992 --> 00:32:15,993
I'll do it.

480
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:17,620
I'll meet with Baek.

481
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:18,746
What?

482
00:32:18,829 --> 00:32:20,247
We used to work together

483
00:32:20,331 --> 00:32:21,540
and were on good terms.

484
00:32:21,624 --> 00:32:23,751
I'll try my best to convince him.

485
00:32:25,628 --> 00:32:27,004
- But--
- Please.

486
00:32:28,589 --> 00:32:31,133
Trust me just this once.

487
00:32:57,833 --> 00:32:58,709
This is…

488
00:32:58,792 --> 00:33:00,335
Do you think this is okay?

489
00:33:01,003 --> 00:33:02,754
She's not one to talk nonsense.

490
00:33:02,838 --> 00:33:04,464
She must have something in mind.

491
00:33:10,137 --> 00:33:12,139
The reason why you're refusing to speak

492
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,558
isn't because you don't want to.

493
00:33:15,184 --> 00:33:16,393
It's because you can't, right?

494
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:29,531
- Why did she turn off the mic?
- Wait.

495
00:33:29,615 --> 00:33:30,782
Let's keep watching.

496
00:33:38,332 --> 00:33:39,958
Because the person you kidnapped

497
00:33:40,042 --> 00:33:42,002
was Lim Sun, not Lee Mi-jin.

498
00:33:42,586 --> 00:33:46,840
But you're sitting here
on charges of kidnapping Lee Mi-jin.

499
00:33:47,841 --> 00:33:49,051
If I tell you,

500
00:33:50,969 --> 00:33:52,054
will you believe me?

501
00:34:41,311 --> 00:34:43,605
What kind of trick is this?

502
00:34:43,689 --> 00:34:45,315
I'm Lim Sun's niece.

503
00:34:46,024 --> 00:34:47,067
I'm Mi-jin.

504
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,695
Is that the best excuse
you could come up with?

505
00:34:50,445 --> 00:34:52,948
Lim Sun and Lee Mi-jin
are the same person?

506
00:34:54,616 --> 00:34:57,995
What are you trying to accomplish
with this doctored video?

507
00:34:59,454 --> 00:35:00,956
Decades.

508
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,334
I've been digging and searching
for over 20 years.

509
00:35:04,918 --> 00:35:06,837
"Why did Lim Sun disappear?"

510
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,963
"For what reason?"

511
00:35:08,046 --> 00:35:11,967
"What happened right after she met me?"

512
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,218
This won't do.

513
00:35:13,302 --> 00:35:14,386
Wait a second.

514
00:35:29,651 --> 00:35:30,902
I understand.

515
00:35:32,154 --> 00:35:33,071
At first,

516
00:35:34,364 --> 00:35:36,241
I couldn't believe it either.

517
00:35:40,746 --> 00:35:42,289
I had forgotten everything,

518
00:35:43,832 --> 00:35:45,042
but I remember now.

519
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:47,586
When I was a kid,

520
00:35:47,669 --> 00:35:49,338
you treated me yourself.

521
00:35:54,593 --> 00:35:57,179
This wound on my forehead.

522
00:35:57,763 --> 00:35:59,306
Do you remember it?

523
00:36:00,766 --> 00:36:02,392
I got hurt riding my bike.

524
00:36:02,476 --> 00:36:04,436
You treated me and told me something.

525
00:36:08,398 --> 00:36:10,275
You said I looked just like my aunt.

526
00:36:11,234 --> 00:36:13,362
<i>But is she really your aunt?</i>

527
00:36:13,445 --> 00:36:14,363
Yes.

528
00:36:14,446 --> 00:36:16,406
You look just like your aunt.

529
00:36:19,326 --> 00:36:20,202
Here.

530
00:36:21,328 --> 00:36:22,829
If she was your mom, we'd believe it.

531
00:36:24,498 --> 00:36:26,291
Great job.

532
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:27,793
You're so brave.

533
00:36:30,212 --> 00:36:33,215
I thought being under this damn curse

534
00:36:33,298 --> 00:36:36,301
and having no choice
but to steal my aunt's identity

535
00:36:36,385 --> 00:36:38,053
was all a coincidence.

536
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:40,764
But I realized
after hearing what you said.

537
00:36:41,973 --> 00:36:43,266
Perhaps…

538
00:36:44,476 --> 00:36:46,937
this was a task assigned to me.

539
00:36:47,604 --> 00:36:48,647
A task?

540
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:50,774
The person who killed your wife

541
00:36:50,857 --> 00:36:51,983
might have…

542
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,028
killed my aunt too.

543
00:36:56,905 --> 00:36:58,657
To solve what you weren't able to,

544
00:36:59,533 --> 00:37:00,742
please help me.

545
00:37:02,869 --> 00:37:05,205
This is driving me crazy.
What are they saying?

546
00:37:09,835 --> 00:37:11,545
Help you with what?

547
00:37:11,628 --> 00:37:12,462
By any chance,

548
00:37:13,046 --> 00:37:14,965
do you suspect anyone else besides me?

549
00:37:15,048 --> 00:37:17,926
Why do I have to tell you that?

550
00:37:18,009 --> 00:37:20,303
I still don't believe
your ridiculous words

551
00:37:20,387 --> 00:37:22,097
and have no intention of believing them!

552
00:37:22,848 --> 00:37:25,934
I was at the scene
the night Ko Na-heun died.

553
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,478
You met the culprit?

554
00:37:28,562 --> 00:37:29,896
I didn't see their face.

555
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,733
But I'm sure the culprit saw mine.

556
00:37:35,527 --> 00:37:36,736
I know it's ridiculous.

557
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,447
And I know it's hard to believe.

558
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,531
But…

559
00:37:40,991 --> 00:37:44,202
I could be the next target.

560
00:37:45,787 --> 00:37:46,746
Mr. Baek.

561
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:49,249
I don't have any time left.

562
00:37:49,875 --> 00:37:52,419
Please, help me!

563
00:37:56,006 --> 00:37:57,215
He definitely reacted.

564
00:37:57,299 --> 00:37:58,675
What do you think she said?

565
00:37:59,426 --> 00:38:00,552
Who knows?

566
00:38:00,635 --> 00:38:03,680
Whatever it was, I'm sure
it's something we can't know about.

567
00:38:06,224 --> 00:38:07,142
Will he talk?

568
00:38:07,225 --> 00:38:09,644
We have to do what we can to make him.

569
00:38:26,745 --> 00:38:30,081
<i>As you can see,
she meets with her niece behind the house.</i>

570
00:38:30,165 --> 00:38:32,751
I don't know why.
But they don't go in together.

571
00:38:32,834 --> 00:38:34,544
Any pictures of them together?

572
00:38:34,628 --> 00:38:35,587
None.

573
00:38:36,338 --> 00:38:37,589
They move separately.

574
00:38:37,672 --> 00:38:40,717
I'm sure the two of them
are up to something.

575
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,844
<i>These are Lim Sun's blood test results.</i>

576
00:38:44,763 --> 00:38:46,097
BLOOD TEST RESULTS
LIM SUN

577
00:38:46,181 --> 00:38:48,975
BLOOD TYPE
A POSITIVE

578
00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:50,227
PATIENT NAME
LIM SUN

579
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,770
O POSITIVE

580
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,898
<i>If the person who killed</i>

581
00:38:54,981 --> 00:38:57,943
Ko Na-heun and your wife
is the same person,

582
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:00,153
I can find them.

583
00:39:04,324 --> 00:39:05,825
I promise I'll catch them.

584
00:39:40,235 --> 00:39:42,320
Is your friend okay?

585
00:39:42,404 --> 00:39:44,739
Are you talking about Mi-jin?

586
00:39:45,615 --> 00:39:47,784
She's always happy.

587
00:39:48,952 --> 00:39:50,662
What a relief.

588
00:39:50,745 --> 00:39:54,207
To be honest, kidnapping victims
experience a lot of trauma.

589
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:57,043
Since you two are close like sisters,

590
00:39:57,127 --> 00:39:58,795
I'm sure Mi-jin already told you.

591
00:39:58,878 --> 00:40:01,172
But make sure you give her a lot of help.

592
00:40:01,256 --> 00:40:02,632
Gosh, on that day,

593
00:40:02,716 --> 00:40:04,801
if it weren't for Mr. Gye,
it would've been--

594
00:40:04,884 --> 00:40:06,803
Just terrible. Right.

595
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,389
I know.

596
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,892
Are you okay?

597
00:40:13,518 --> 00:40:15,604
So you're saying,

598
00:40:16,354 --> 00:40:17,981
just like how we see on TV,

599
00:40:18,815 --> 00:40:21,192
Mi-jin had been kidnapped, right?

600
00:40:22,068 --> 00:40:23,445
Yes, that's right.

601
00:40:28,116 --> 00:40:29,075
Right.

602
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,806
Where are you?

603
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:53,933
Come to my house right now!

604
00:40:54,643 --> 00:40:56,519
Never mind. Hey.

605
00:40:57,103 --> 00:40:58,813
It's late, so just stay there.

606
00:40:58,897 --> 00:40:59,814
I'll come to you.

607
00:41:04,527 --> 00:41:05,403
Hey, Ga-yeong.

608
00:41:05,904 --> 00:41:08,907
- You bring the food containers?
- I'll bring them next time.

609
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,867
I made more food, so take it when you go.

610
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:11,785
Okay.

611
00:41:19,459 --> 00:41:20,418
Hey.

612
00:41:22,671 --> 00:41:25,256
Hey! What's wrong with you? Hey!

613
00:41:26,758 --> 00:41:28,385
What's with you? What?

614
00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:36,142
Wait. Why are you crying?

615
00:41:36,226 --> 00:41:39,062
What is it? Did something happen?

616
00:41:41,022 --> 00:41:43,400
- I heard you were kidnapped.
- What?

617
00:41:43,483 --> 00:41:45,694
I heard you were kidnapped, you idiot!

618
00:41:46,695 --> 00:41:47,779
No, don't!

619
00:41:47,862 --> 00:41:49,155
No.

620
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:50,532
No. Wait.

621
00:41:50,615 --> 00:41:51,950
What are you two doing?

622
00:41:52,033 --> 00:41:55,328
- Is Ga-yeong staying for dinner?
- Yeah, she is!

623
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:57,038
Hey, Ga-yeong.

624
00:41:58,164 --> 00:41:59,249
Ga-yeong.

625
00:41:59,916 --> 00:42:01,668
Hey, where did you hear that?

626
00:42:01,751 --> 00:42:02,585
Mi-jin…

627
00:42:03,086 --> 00:42:05,505
Why didn't you tell me?

628
00:42:08,049 --> 00:42:10,844
I didn't even know, like a crazy bitch.

629
00:42:12,053 --> 00:42:13,054
Hey.

630
00:42:14,514 --> 00:42:17,016
How could you do this to me?

631
00:42:18,476 --> 00:42:21,312
I didn't know what had happened to you.

632
00:42:22,355 --> 00:42:24,566
I didn't even know anything.

633
00:42:25,191 --> 00:42:27,944
I'm really sorry.

634
00:42:28,987 --> 00:42:31,322
Are you okay? Are you?

635
00:42:31,406 --> 00:42:34,159
You should've told me!

636
00:42:34,242 --> 00:42:36,453
I'm so sorry.

637
00:42:37,162 --> 00:42:38,580
I'm sorry.

638
00:42:38,663 --> 00:42:40,457
Are you really okay?

639
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,833
Yeah, I'm okay.

640
00:42:41,916 --> 00:42:44,544
I didn't get hurt at all.
I'm completely fine.

641
00:42:45,253 --> 00:42:47,464
I'm going to kill that bastard!

642
00:42:50,925 --> 00:42:52,218
Hold on.

643
00:42:52,302 --> 00:42:53,470
Okay.

644
00:42:53,553 --> 00:42:56,014
You crazy bitch! You should've told me!

645
00:42:56,598 --> 00:43:00,685
I'll snap his neck!
I'll make him beg for mercy!

646
00:43:02,437 --> 00:43:04,314
Okay.

647
00:43:04,397 --> 00:43:06,983
I didn't know how sad this show was!

648
00:43:07,525 --> 00:43:10,945
All right. Okay. I get it.

649
00:43:11,029 --> 00:43:13,323
I'm so sorry.

650
00:43:18,536 --> 00:43:20,163
I'm just really curious.

651
00:43:20,246 --> 00:43:21,915
Why do you keep coming to my house?

652
00:43:24,042 --> 00:43:25,585
You think I came for no reason at all?

653
00:43:25,668 --> 00:43:28,338
- Yes.
- I have a family, and I'm very busy.

654
00:43:28,421 --> 00:43:29,839
But despite all of that,

655
00:43:30,423 --> 00:43:33,134
you're overwhelmed with work,
so I came to help you.

656
00:43:33,218 --> 00:43:35,386
- You don't even help.
- Do you have any beer?

657
00:43:36,346 --> 00:43:38,473
- I don't.
- But I'm thirsty.

658
00:43:38,556 --> 00:43:40,225
I don't have anything!

659
00:43:44,062 --> 00:43:45,021
There's no soju either!

660
00:43:45,104 --> 00:43:46,648
I'm tired, so just go.

661
00:43:47,315 --> 00:43:48,274
Right now?

662
00:43:48,358 --> 00:43:49,651
I have to work.

663
00:43:50,985 --> 00:43:51,820
Wait a second.

664
00:43:51,903 --> 00:43:53,696
I need to use your bathroom.

665
00:43:55,406 --> 00:43:56,282
Jeez.

666
00:43:57,534 --> 00:43:58,827
What's wrong with him?

667
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:01,204
MY DEAR WIFE

668
00:44:05,625 --> 00:44:06,835
Your phone's ringing!

669
00:44:12,173 --> 00:44:13,299
Your wife's calling.

670
00:44:16,094 --> 00:44:17,011
No.

671
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:19,055
No!

672
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:35,113
<i>This is a special deal
for only our VIP customers!</i>

673
00:44:35,196 --> 00:44:37,156
<i>Change cell phones now</i>

674
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,827
<i>and receive up to 500,000 won!</i>

675
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:43,204
<i>You'll never see a deal like this again!</i>

676
00:44:46,499 --> 00:44:47,542
What was that?

677
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:50,044
Why did you save
a spam call as your wife?

678
00:44:50,878 --> 00:44:51,713
Well…

679
00:44:55,425 --> 00:44:56,593
What is it?

680
00:44:57,135 --> 00:44:58,177
What's wrong?

681
00:44:58,928 --> 00:45:00,597
What? What's the matter?

682
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,181
What is it? Tell me.

683
00:45:02,724 --> 00:45:04,058
No, it's too embarrassing.

684
00:45:04,892 --> 00:45:05,935
Gosh.

685
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,691
Wait, so the marriage was a sham…

686
00:45:11,774 --> 00:45:12,817
No.

687
00:45:14,027 --> 00:45:16,237
There was no wedding
or marriage certificate.

688
00:45:16,321 --> 00:45:18,281
She just stole your money and ran.

689
00:45:18,364 --> 00:45:20,241
So you were literally scammed.

690
00:45:21,284 --> 00:45:22,285
Wow.

691
00:45:22,368 --> 00:45:25,413
She must've been really good
to have duped an investigator.

692
00:45:25,496 --> 00:45:26,497
Thanks to her,

693
00:45:26,581 --> 00:45:29,667
when victims come to testify
with desperation in their hearts,

694
00:45:29,751 --> 00:45:30,710
I kind of… No.

695
00:45:30,793 --> 00:45:33,087
I fully understand how they feel.

696
00:45:34,088 --> 00:45:36,758
I've channeled my pain into my work ethic.

697
00:45:39,177 --> 00:45:41,220
But you passed out
those wedding invitations.

698
00:45:41,971 --> 00:45:44,766
Wait, what did you do
with the congratulatory money I sent?

699
00:45:44,849 --> 00:45:46,059
Give it back now.

700
00:45:46,142 --> 00:45:49,145
- How could you say that to a scam victim?
- I'm a victim too!

701
00:45:49,228 --> 00:45:51,981
You always used your wife
or mother-in-law as an excuse!

702
00:45:52,857 --> 00:45:55,568
You shouldn't lie so much.
You work for the government.

703
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:59,781
Once you start lying about a few things,
it becomes pretty easy.

704
00:45:59,864 --> 00:46:00,907
Jeez.

705
00:46:01,741 --> 00:46:03,493
So how much did you lose?

706
00:46:03,576 --> 00:46:05,286
Not much. Just the house deposit.

707
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:09,624
What?

708
00:46:09,707 --> 00:46:10,792
Are you crazy?

709
00:46:12,043 --> 00:46:14,212
I have the cheapest studio apartment
in my building,

710
00:46:14,295 --> 00:46:16,255
so it's freezing in the winter.

711
00:46:16,339 --> 00:46:18,758
And I can't keep staying at a bathhouse.

712
00:46:19,425 --> 00:46:20,802
Do you have an extra room?

713
00:46:20,885 --> 00:46:22,804
What extra room? Look for yourself.

714
00:46:23,596 --> 00:46:24,722
No way!

715
00:46:27,016 --> 00:46:30,353
I have no home.
You're not going to kick me out, are you?

716
00:46:31,646 --> 00:46:32,939
I didn't hear him. Nope.

717
00:46:37,985 --> 00:46:39,487
Can you turn up the heater?

718
00:46:42,615 --> 00:46:44,450
No, never mind. This is perfect.

719
00:46:44,534 --> 00:46:45,368
Wow.

720
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:46,953
It's so warm.

721
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:48,621
What do I do?

722
00:46:50,581 --> 00:46:52,166
You didn't change after sunset?

723
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:54,210
- No.
- Isn't that a good thing?

724
00:46:57,004 --> 00:46:57,839
Of course not.

725
00:46:58,423 --> 00:47:03,094
That means you're slowly spending
more time as Lim Sun.

726
00:47:04,178 --> 00:47:06,180
I didn't change
for a while after sunset.

727
00:47:06,973 --> 00:47:10,393
Luckily, it's not something
that always happens.

728
00:47:10,476 --> 00:47:12,478
So I didn't get caught this time, but…

729
00:47:14,939 --> 00:47:16,441
Then, what happens now?

730
00:47:20,486 --> 00:47:21,863
After that…

731
00:47:22,363 --> 00:47:24,490
- I checked the times.
- Okay.

732
00:47:24,574 --> 00:47:27,493
The amount of time
not changing even after sunset

733
00:47:27,577 --> 00:47:28,661
has gradually…

734
00:47:30,621 --> 00:47:31,456
increased.

735
00:47:32,248 --> 00:47:36,210
Then, are you saying
you could completely change into Lim Sun?

736
00:47:37,795 --> 00:47:39,005
Maybe.

737
00:47:40,256 --> 00:47:41,966
No way.

738
00:47:42,049 --> 00:47:45,303
We can't be sitting here like this.
Shouldn't we do something?

739
00:47:46,471 --> 00:47:50,308
Yeah, we have to do something,
but we can't find even the cat.

740
00:47:50,975 --> 00:47:52,435
Or maybe

741
00:47:53,186 --> 00:47:54,979
it wasn't because of the cat
to begin with.

742
00:47:56,355 --> 00:47:59,650
Or maybe you'll change
if we catch the culprit?

743
00:47:59,734 --> 00:48:00,818
The culprit?

744
00:48:00,902 --> 00:48:02,862
In TV shows and movies,

745
00:48:02,945 --> 00:48:05,323
things change
at the end of a dramatic event.

746
00:48:05,406 --> 00:48:07,825
So that crazy killer…

747
00:48:07,909 --> 00:48:10,203
Yeah, if you help catch that crazy killer,

748
00:48:10,286 --> 00:48:11,120
then who knows?

749
00:48:11,662 --> 00:48:13,831
The heavens may be moved
to lift this curse.

750
00:48:17,126 --> 00:48:20,004
Even if that's not the case,
you're just going to give up and grow old?

751
00:48:20,087 --> 00:48:21,631
We have to try something.

752
00:48:38,022 --> 00:48:39,106
Jeez.

753
00:48:41,859 --> 00:48:42,777
Gosh.

754
00:48:44,111 --> 00:48:48,324
<i>Right. I can't keep
hiding like this forever.</i>

755
00:48:48,407 --> 00:48:50,868
<i>But what if they can't catch the culprit?</i>

756
00:48:50,952 --> 00:48:53,454
<i>Do I have to live in anxiety</i>

757
00:48:53,538 --> 00:48:55,331
<i>for the rest of my life?</i>

758
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:03,089
SEOHAN CITY SUNSET TIME

759
00:49:03,172 --> 00:49:06,592
SUNRISE TIME 6:25 A.M.
SUNSET TIME 6:25 P.M.

760
00:49:28,114 --> 00:49:29,782
What in the world?

761
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:30,700
No way!

762
00:49:30,783 --> 00:49:31,868
What is it now?

763
00:49:32,451 --> 00:49:34,495
<i>Omurice</i> was for dinner a few days ago,

764
00:49:34,579 --> 00:49:36,455
but it's <i>omurice </i>again tonight.
I'm sick of it.

765
00:49:36,539 --> 00:49:38,749
Then, just eat out. Why get angry over it?

766
00:49:38,833 --> 00:49:40,293
- Let's go.
- Okay.

767
00:49:41,127 --> 00:49:42,211
Come with us.

768
00:49:42,295 --> 00:49:44,463
I'm not hungry. Go without me.

769
00:49:44,547 --> 00:49:45,590
Do you want takeout?

770
00:49:45,673 --> 00:49:46,924
No, it's fine.

771
00:49:47,008 --> 00:49:48,593
- We'll be back.
- Okay.

772
00:50:12,991 --> 00:50:13,992
Enjoy your meal.

773
00:50:16,327 --> 00:50:18,163
<i>Do you know</i>

774
00:50:18,246 --> 00:50:20,206
what's even sadder

775
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:21,583
than losing that money?

776
00:50:21,666 --> 00:50:22,667
I'm not curious.

777
00:50:22,751 --> 00:50:25,253
The pain of losing someone you love.

778
00:50:26,171 --> 00:50:29,466
That's what makes it
an even tougher time.

779
00:50:29,549 --> 00:50:32,218
But it was one-sided,
so what's the point? She was fake.

780
00:50:32,302 --> 00:50:33,678
I just can't talk to you.

781
00:50:33,762 --> 00:50:35,221
Then, hurry and go to bed.

782
00:50:35,805 --> 00:50:37,974
It was real love for me, okay?

783
00:50:38,057 --> 00:50:40,810
Jeez. Fine. It was real love.

784
00:50:46,524 --> 00:50:49,194
Eat up. I'm sure you feel
pretty sick to your stomach.

785
00:50:54,157 --> 00:50:55,158
Did…

786
00:50:55,241 --> 00:50:57,368
Did I do something foolish last night?

787
00:50:57,452 --> 00:50:58,369
Something foolish?

788
00:50:58,453 --> 00:51:00,830
Well, nothing really foolish.

789
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:06,377
But I did realize something thanks to you.

790
00:51:06,461 --> 00:51:09,214
Don't let people
with bad drunk habits into your home.

791
00:51:09,297 --> 00:51:10,173
Especially,

792
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,300
people with sob stories.

793
00:51:12,383 --> 00:51:13,927
I realized they were hopeless.

794
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:16,012
"Never associate with them."
Things like that.

795
00:51:16,763 --> 00:51:17,597
Yeah.

796
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,141
But that wasn't the case,

797
00:51:21,267 --> 00:51:22,143
so relax and eat.

798
00:51:22,227 --> 00:51:23,728
You scared me. That's not me.

799
00:51:23,812 --> 00:51:26,481
I'd never do that. I have my act together.

800
00:51:26,564 --> 00:51:27,440
But…

801
00:51:27,524 --> 00:51:28,983
I did realize something.

802
00:51:30,902 --> 00:51:32,028
In a good way.

803
00:51:32,904 --> 00:51:35,031
<i>That's why I decided</i>

804
00:51:35,657 --> 00:51:36,574
that if…

805
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:40,912
if I actually fell in love
with someone again,

806
00:51:41,955 --> 00:51:43,414
I would be so good to them.

807
00:51:43,998 --> 00:51:45,917
Why would you end up at that decision?

808
00:51:46,543 --> 00:51:48,002
Wouldn't the normal answer be

809
00:51:48,086 --> 00:51:50,421
you'd never fall in love
or trust women again?

810
00:51:52,632 --> 00:51:56,135
For someone like you
who's optimized for living alone,

811
00:51:56,219 --> 00:51:57,804
what would you know?

812
00:51:57,887 --> 00:51:59,639
You don't know anything, Mr. Gye.

813
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:03,810
The pain of losing the one you love.

814
00:52:04,811 --> 00:52:08,064
The helplessness
of being able to do nothing.

815
00:52:08,982 --> 00:52:09,816
And…

816
00:52:10,942 --> 00:52:13,111
the fear of ending up alone.

817
00:52:16,823 --> 00:52:19,367
You would never know what that feels like.

818
00:52:21,411 --> 00:52:22,495
I know it too.

819
00:52:24,914 --> 00:52:26,749
I've never told you this before…

820
00:52:29,168 --> 00:52:31,462
but I never want to go through

821
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:33,506
losing someone again…

822
00:52:35,258 --> 00:52:36,134
Are you asleep?

823
00:52:38,428 --> 00:52:39,387
Jeez.

824
00:52:40,847 --> 00:52:41,973
Don't sleep like that.

825
00:53:02,535 --> 00:53:04,078
You scared me!

826
00:53:04,162 --> 00:53:05,038
Jeez!

827
00:53:07,832 --> 00:53:09,250
I can finally take my first bite.

828
00:53:18,885 --> 00:53:24,682
SEOHAN PROVINCIAL POLICE AGENCY

829
00:53:51,876 --> 00:53:54,921
<i>What if you came to the station
as a witness, got exposed,</i>

830
00:53:55,004 --> 00:53:56,089
<i>and became a target?</i>

831
00:53:56,172 --> 00:53:58,049
The sun doesn't stop murderers.

832
00:53:58,675 --> 00:54:00,843
<i>I've been digging and searching
for over 20 years.</i>

833
00:54:00,927 --> 00:54:02,929
"Why did Lim Sun disappear?"

834
00:54:03,012 --> 00:54:05,098
"For what reason?"

835
00:54:05,181 --> 00:54:08,101
"What happened right after she met me?"

836
00:54:08,184 --> 00:54:10,478
<i>If Baek Cheol-gyu isn't the culprit,</i>

837
00:54:11,396 --> 00:54:12,647
<i>then who is?</i>

838
00:54:13,398 --> 00:54:14,357
<i>Who is it?</i>

839
00:55:46,908 --> 00:55:47,950
Are you okay?

840
00:55:52,246 --> 00:55:53,372
It's okay.

841
00:55:53,456 --> 00:55:54,332
I'm here now.

842
00:55:55,458 --> 00:55:58,419
<i>I'll trust you, so keep your promise.</i>

843
00:56:00,129 --> 00:56:02,965
I prepared your meal,
so make sure you eat.

844
00:56:16,854 --> 00:56:17,772
Hello, Detective Kwon.

845
00:56:18,356 --> 00:56:19,190
Mr. Gye,

846
00:56:19,273 --> 00:56:22,610
Ms. Lee Mi-jin is here,
and she wants to give a statement

847
00:56:22,693 --> 00:56:24,320
in regards to Ko Na-heun's case.

848
00:56:24,403 --> 00:56:25,905
A statement?

849
00:56:25,988 --> 00:56:29,575
But she's asking to meet
Baek Cheol-gyu first.

850
00:56:30,201 --> 00:56:31,077
What should I do?

851
00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:33,496
I'll be right there, so just wait.

852
00:56:50,138 --> 00:56:52,640
Maybe you'll change
if we catch the culprit?

853
00:56:52,723 --> 00:56:53,808
The culprit?

854
00:56:53,891 --> 00:56:56,894
If you help catch that crazy killer,

855
00:56:56,978 --> 00:56:57,979
then who knows?

856
00:56:58,062 --> 00:57:00,898
The heavens may be moved
to lift this curse.

857
00:57:25,882 --> 00:57:27,091
Let's go.

858
00:57:27,842 --> 00:57:28,676
Wait a second.

859
00:57:30,761 --> 00:57:31,971
No, wait.

860
00:57:35,766 --> 00:57:37,768
Mr. Gye, wait. Please?

861
00:57:44,567 --> 00:57:45,610
I said let go!

862
00:57:45,693 --> 00:57:47,987
Are you insane? Why would you come here?

863
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:49,780
Just hiding won't solve this.

864
00:57:52,283 --> 00:57:54,035
If I tell them I'm a witness,

865
00:57:54,619 --> 00:57:56,621
it could help the investigation.

866
00:57:56,704 --> 00:57:58,331
What if Baek isn't the culprit?

867
00:57:58,414 --> 00:58:01,459
What if that damn killer
is still out there?

868
00:58:01,542 --> 00:58:03,419
What will you do if they find you?

869
00:58:03,503 --> 00:58:05,379
That's why we don't have time!

870
00:58:05,463 --> 00:58:07,173
I told you I'd catch them!

871
00:58:09,675 --> 00:58:12,136
I told you I'd do whatever it takes
to catch them.

872
00:58:18,184 --> 00:58:19,936
But you haven't caught them yet.

873
00:58:33,366 --> 00:58:34,742
I'm sorry.

874
00:58:35,326 --> 00:58:36,661
I should trust you.

875
00:58:37,411 --> 00:58:39,580
I wanted to trust you and wait,

876
00:58:41,666 --> 00:58:43,334
but I'm so scared.

877
00:58:44,126 --> 00:58:46,254
I couldn't just sit at home
and do nothing.

878
00:58:56,847 --> 00:58:58,307
I promise I'll catch them.

879
00:59:00,685 --> 00:59:02,478
I'll never let someone I care about

880
00:59:03,396 --> 00:59:04,689
disappear again.

881
00:59:23,291 --> 00:59:24,584
I'm sorry I was late.

882
00:59:25,918 --> 00:59:27,336
I'm late in catching the culprit

883
00:59:28,504 --> 00:59:31,257
and in realizing my feelings for you.
I'm sorry for everything.

884
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:02,598
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

885
01:01:02,682 --> 01:01:05,518
<i>I didn't come because I was worried.
When I come and see you,</i>

886
01:01:05,601 --> 01:01:07,937
I don't have to look for you in my dreams.

887
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,776
<i>We're sitting together,
but why do I feel so lonely?</i>

888
01:01:15,152 --> 01:01:17,029
To be honest,
there's someone else I like.

889
01:01:17,113 --> 01:01:18,072
It doesn't matter.

890
01:01:18,155 --> 01:01:19,448
<i>She has a crush?</i>

891
01:01:19,532 --> 01:01:21,409
- Want to get a drink after--
- Damn it!

892
01:01:21,492 --> 01:01:24,578
You said you don't know
where she works or what she does.
