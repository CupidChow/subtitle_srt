1
00:00:50,132 --> 00:00:54,762
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

2
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:01,602
I found Gong Eun-sim.

3
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:06,732
Ms. Kang Gyeong-hui.

4
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,943
She'd been right next to us.

5
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:14,782
She pretended to be Na Ok-hui
and got a job here.

6
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,659
She's a senior intern like Ms. Lim.

7
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,203
I found her.

8
00:01:20,788 --> 00:01:22,707
I know who killed Ko Na-heun.

9
00:01:30,172 --> 00:01:31,424
Dad!

10
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,926
Na Ok-hui. She's the culprit.

11
00:01:35,344 --> 00:01:36,429
Lee Mi-jin.

12
00:01:38,472 --> 00:01:39,932
Don't tell anyone.

13
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,767
Come to where we first met.

14
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,687
Where's my dad?

15
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,480
I've changed the location though.

16
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:21,015
DAD

17
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,109
Dad!

18
00:02:45,998 --> 00:02:47,917
- You're all done now.
- Thank you.

19
00:02:49,293 --> 00:02:50,336
Not bad.

20
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,632
My procedure just finished. How do I look?

21
00:02:54,715 --> 00:02:57,259
It's been a while
since I splurged on my skin.

22
00:02:57,843 --> 00:03:01,555
I'll post the full video
of this makeover tomorrow.

23
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,099
I hope you watch. Bye!

24
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:04,517
- Don't forget your things.
- Okay.

25
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,519
- And come to the front desk, please.
- Okay.

26
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:13,984
MISSED CALLS
MI-JIN

27
00:03:14,902 --> 00:03:16,028
What is this?

28
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:20,741
If you can't reach me, call the cops.

29
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,792
The person you are trying to call…

30
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,211
Damn it! Why won't she pick up?

31
00:03:32,294 --> 00:03:33,587
Mr. Gye.

32
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,841
Wait, I don't have his number.

33
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,634
What do I do?

34
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:44,557
MOVE YOUR CAR

35
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,484
Hey, neighbor.
To what do I owe this pleasure?

36
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,527
Hi, it's me.

37
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,612
I think something's happened to Mi-jin.

38
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,072
What are you talking about?

39
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,116
I have 12 missed calls from her.

40
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:04,910
I wasn't able to pick up at the time.

41
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,704
But I got a text from her too.

42
00:04:06,787 --> 00:04:09,623
She told me to call the cops
if I couldn't reach her.

43
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,542
What do I do?

44
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:17,673
- Zoom in here.
- Yes, sir.

45
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,759
- Mr. Gye!
- Yes?

46
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,886
I think something's happened to Mi-jin.

47
00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:24,722
- What do you mean?
- I got a call from your neighbor.

48
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:27,600
Mi-jin texted her to call the cops
if she couldn't be reached.

49
00:04:27,683 --> 00:04:29,393
And she hasn't been picking up since.

50
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:31,437
What are you talking about?

51
00:04:35,524 --> 00:04:38,694
The person you are trying to call…

52
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,659
LAST SIGNAL LOCATION
113-7 CHUKMALMYEON, SEOHAN CITY

53
00:04:46,368 --> 00:04:47,870
It's a map.

54
00:04:47,953 --> 00:04:48,954
She sent me the location.

55
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,873
24-3 CHUKMALMYEON, SEOHAN CITY

56
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:54,877
Ms. Lee Mi-jin!

57
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:06,347
Detective Kwon.

58
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,558
Get the location from Mr. Ju,
and ask for backup now.

59
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,393
- Yes, sir.
- Here it is.

60
00:05:11,977 --> 00:05:13,312
Wait, Mr. Gye!

61
00:05:13,395 --> 00:05:14,438
I'll text it to you.

62
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:17,650
HWARIMDANG TRADITIONAL TEAHOUSE

63
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,612
LEE MI-JIN
LIM MI-JIN

64
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,422
Where's my dad?

65
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,468
Where's my dad?

66
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,888
Where is my dad?

67
00:05:56,605 --> 00:05:59,483
You didn't hurt him, did you?

68
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,528
Your dad isn't the one I want to hurt.

69
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,866
Lee Mi-jin.

70
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:08,450
It's you.

71
00:06:23,465 --> 00:06:26,093
Detective Kwon,
anything to report from there?

72
00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:28,512
Okay. Then, come quick
to the address I texted you.

73
00:06:56,123 --> 00:06:57,124
Did you find her phone?

74
00:06:57,207 --> 00:06:58,417
It's not Mi-jin's.

75
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,554
The last locations of Lee Mi-jin,
Na Ok-hui, and Gong Gi-cheol were here,

76
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,181
and all their phones are off.

77
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,435
I'm going to look around.
Find out whose phone this is.

78
00:07:16,518 --> 00:07:17,519
Okay.

79
00:07:43,295 --> 00:07:45,214
Did you find any other signs?

80
00:07:45,297 --> 00:07:46,757
No, nothing yet.

81
00:07:47,716 --> 00:07:48,801
Mr. Gye.

82
00:07:48,884 --> 00:07:51,095
The phone belongs to Mi-jin's father.

83
00:07:51,178 --> 00:07:52,179
Her father?

84
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,890
Fortunately, the officers
searching the teahouse

85
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,517
found where he was locked up.

86
00:08:00,562 --> 00:08:02,731
There's someone here!

87
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:06,026
He came to right away.

88
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,405
After speaking with him,
he said he passed out after drinking tea.

89
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:11,282
He doesn't remember anything else.

90
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,661
Na Ok-hui… I mean,

91
00:08:15,744 --> 00:08:18,372
Gong Eun-sim's old house
is near here apparently.

92
00:08:18,455 --> 00:08:19,456
Where is it?

93
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:19,099
Do you know what's more fun
than hanging and beating a dog to death?

94
00:09:20,225 --> 00:09:22,019
It's hearing the whimpering

95
00:09:22,102 --> 00:09:26,190
of a dying dog using its last bit
of strength to beg for its life.

96
00:09:28,108 --> 00:09:30,110
That's when its true nature emerges.

97
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,912
You killed my aunt, didn't you?

98
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,002
Is that important right now?

99
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,379
Of course, it is.

100
00:09:49,838 --> 00:09:52,966
My family searched frantically
and waited so long for her.

101
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:55,761
But you didn't find her.

102
00:09:57,846 --> 00:10:01,058
You should've tried harder
if you loved her that much.

103
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,895
You gave up in the end

104
00:10:04,978 --> 00:10:06,480
and abandoned her.

105
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,611
You don't even know where she is now.

106
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:40,806
Damn it.

107
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,848
Did you find anything?

108
00:11:22,931 --> 00:11:24,475
No, there's nothing here.

109
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,935
There's nothing here, sir.

110
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:30,314
But it seems someone
lived here recently.

111
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,609
- You find anything?
- No, not yet.

112
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:38,780
Mr. Gye!

113
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,263
LEE MI-JIN
LIM MI-JIN

114
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,069
What in the world is this?

115
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:19,446
She must've been here.

116
00:12:20,697 --> 00:12:22,115
Have this area searched now.

117
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,576
- Redirect backup to come here.
- Yes, sir.

118
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:31,458
It's me. Don't go to the greenhouse.

119
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,919
Come here first.
I'll send the coordinates.

120
00:12:34,878 --> 00:12:36,213
Come right now. Okay.

121
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:42,844
Mr. Gye!

122
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,264
Have just a few on standby.

123
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,057
Everyone else, get here right now!

124
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:43,947
Come out, come out, wherever you are

125
00:13:44,948 --> 00:13:48,243
Come out, come out

126
00:13:58,795 --> 00:14:02,591
Mi-jin!

127
00:14:05,635 --> 00:14:06,636
Lee Mi-jin!

128
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:03,568
Where is she?

129
00:15:11,618 --> 00:15:13,495
Where are you?

130
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,929
What are you doing here?

131
00:16:17,934 --> 00:16:19,102
But I killed you.

132
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,395
Please don't kill me.

133
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:22,522
Must be nice to have a family.

134
00:16:23,356 --> 00:16:25,192
You have people who worry about you.

135
00:16:28,236 --> 00:16:30,322
Please don't kill me!

136
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,866
I'm sure I killed you.

137
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,829
Why are you…

138
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,084
Stay away.

139
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,380
Why did you do it?

140
00:16:47,964 --> 00:16:50,425
Isn't this what you talked about?

141
00:16:51,134 --> 00:16:53,804
Wanting to die but not being able to?

142
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,347
Stay back!

143
00:16:58,433 --> 00:16:59,768
Stay back?

144
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,395
Now, it's your turn.

145
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,480
Stay away from me!

146
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:42,727
Mi-jin!

147
00:18:04,332 --> 00:18:06,626
Detective Kwon, I caught the culprit.

148
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,295
I'll send the coordinates so come here.

149
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:16,511
Mi-jin!

150
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,894
Did you know?

151
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:27,355
They say cats give back
as much as they receive.

152
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:28,560
Over here! We found something!

153
00:20:28,643 --> 00:20:29,811
Come over here!

154
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,902
According to KCSI,

155
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,821
it's been about 20 years.

156
00:20:39,904 --> 00:20:43,199
We'll know for sure
after a thorough analysis.

157
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,705
Yes, Captain?

158
00:20:48,788 --> 00:20:51,207
Yes, we're wrapping things up now.

159
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:53,460
Am I pretty?

160
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,920
Of course. You take after me.

161
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:57,964
It's a gift for you.

162
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,383
Wow, it's a huge diamond ring!

163
00:21:48,973 --> 00:21:50,016
Here.

164
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:57,232
They said the first snow
of the season's falling tonight.

165
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:58,858
How about we make a snowman?

166
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,360
You really promise?

167
00:22:00,443 --> 00:22:01,820
I really promise.

168
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,571
I'll be home soon.

169
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,739
Hurry home.

170
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,409
Mi-jin, are you awake?

171
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,537
Hey, don't get up. Just lie down.

172
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:36,456
What happened?

173
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:38,374
You know what you did wrong, don't you?

174
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:43,212
Damn it. If you weren't hurt,
I'd kill you myself. I swear.

175
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,595
Are you insane?

176
00:23:50,678 --> 00:23:52,555
Why would you even go there?

177
00:23:53,806 --> 00:23:56,643
What if something
terrible happened to you?

178
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:58,770
I had no choice.

179
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:02,065
She had my dad and threatened me.
What could I do?

180
00:24:03,983 --> 00:24:05,735
What about my dad? Is he okay?

181
00:24:05,818 --> 00:24:08,237
He was admitted upstairs.

182
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,615
I have to see him.

183
00:24:10,698 --> 00:24:11,950
No, you can't go like this.

184
00:24:13,576 --> 00:24:15,411
I went to see him.

185
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,498
He's fine. So don't worry and rest.

186
00:24:19,248 --> 00:24:21,459
I'll tell the nurse you're up.

187
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:22,627
Just rest, okay?

188
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,609
What are you doing here?

189
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,529
I'm sure I killed you.

190
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,158
It was really scary, right?

191
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:57,412
When you're in danger next time,

192
00:24:57,495 --> 00:25:00,456
I promise I'll come to your rescue.

193
00:25:01,457 --> 00:25:02,792
What if you're not around?

194
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:04,711
I'm not going anywhere.

195
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,421
I'll be right by your side.

196
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:10,341
I'll come running to save you.

197
00:25:10,925 --> 00:25:11,926
You promise?

198
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,015
Pinky swear.

199
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,475
And seal it. Boom.

200
00:26:12,278 --> 00:26:13,446
Cheong,

201
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,531
it's a misunderstanding.

202
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,533
I didn't tell him to go

203
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:20,495
when I gave him
the address of the teahouse.

204
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:23,081
He tried to stop me.

205
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,541
But I was stubborn.

206
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:30,421
That's right!
I kept telling him he shouldn't go.

207
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,882
But he forced it out of me with threats.

208
00:26:32,965 --> 00:26:34,467
That's not true.

209
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,593
Both of you, shut it.

210
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:41,933
Honey, you and Mi-jin are all I have now.

211
00:26:42,016 --> 00:26:43,643
Got it?

212
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:46,020
Please. I'm begging you.

213
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,189
Okay, I was wrong.

214
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:50,900
Dad.

215
00:26:52,276 --> 00:26:53,277
I'm sorry.

216
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,531
It's all my fault.

217
00:26:57,323 --> 00:26:58,866
Why won't she pick up?

218
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,452
I wonder if she knows
her father's in the hospital.

219
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:04,705
She's probably busy with work.
Don't keep calling her.

220
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:05,665
Give me a second.

221
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,416
Goodness.

222
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,876
What is she doing?

223
00:27:09,752 --> 00:27:10,837
Good grief.

224
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,259
The person you are trying to call…

225
00:27:50,209 --> 00:27:51,919
Why haven't I changed back yet?

226
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,799
Does a day need to pass
after catching the culprit?

227
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:05,725
I said I'm okay! I'm completely fine,
so why would I stay here?

228
00:28:05,808 --> 00:28:07,685
Will you just listen?

229
00:28:07,768 --> 00:28:09,145
The doctor told you.

230
00:28:09,228 --> 00:28:12,565
They said to stay the night
and see how you progress!

231
00:28:12,648 --> 00:28:14,734
- Yeah.
- You're still in a neck brace too.

232
00:28:14,817 --> 00:28:16,360
- This is--
- Dad!

233
00:28:17,361 --> 00:28:19,322
Dad, were you hurt anywhere else?

234
00:28:19,405 --> 00:28:20,406
I'm fine.

235
00:28:20,489 --> 00:28:22,200
- Goodness.
- Dad.

236
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,285
I thought I'd never see you again.

237
00:28:24,368 --> 00:28:25,995
I was so scared.

238
00:28:26,078 --> 00:28:27,371
Goodness!

239
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,706
What's with you?

240
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:29,749
You brat!

241
00:28:29,832 --> 00:28:31,709
Why didn't you answer your phone?

242
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,295
I lost my phone.

243
00:28:34,378 --> 00:28:36,505
- What?
- How did you know your dad was here?

244
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,634
Ga-yeong called me at work.

245
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:41,469
- I see.
- What happened to your face?

246
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,846
This?

247
00:28:44,555 --> 00:28:45,389
I nicked it at work.

248
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,433
- How did you scratch your face at work?
- Gosh.

249
00:28:47,516 --> 00:28:49,852
Dad, I'm so glad you're okay.

250
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,145
Goodness.

251
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,523
I'm fine. I'm okay.

252
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:54,440
- You are?
- Yeah.

253
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:55,358
Hello?

254
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,196
Yes, this is Lim Cheong.

255
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:01,489
The police station?

256
00:29:03,866 --> 00:29:05,034
Yes!

257
00:29:05,117 --> 00:29:06,577
Yes, my sister's Lim Sun…

258
00:29:09,163 --> 00:29:12,291
Yes.

259
00:29:14,877 --> 00:29:16,420
The culprit of the mutilation murder

260
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:19,131
that occurred in Seohan
last October has been caught.

261
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:22,552
The culprit attempted to kidnap
and kill a witness she had run into

262
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:24,679
while fleeing from a crime
she previously committed.

263
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:27,640
Her attempt failed when the victim
escaped from where she was held.

264
00:29:27,723 --> 00:29:28,766
While pursuing the victim,

265
00:29:28,849 --> 00:29:32,061
the culprit was caught by prosecutors
and police searching the area.

266
00:29:32,144 --> 00:29:35,022
A large number of opium poppies
and drugs derived from its substances

267
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,483
were found in the culprit's greenhouse.

268
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,278
And the extent of her crimes
doesn't stop there.

269
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,738
In the yard of the culprit's old house,

270
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:45,408
the skeletonized remains
of two bodies were discovered.

271
00:29:45,491 --> 00:29:48,202
Both were identified as victims
of a missing persons case

272
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,121
in Seohan that began in 2000.

273
00:29:50,204 --> 00:29:53,749
The victims were finally returned
to their families after 24 years.

274
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,503
I heard one of the victims
was your mother.

275
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:00,339
Why didn't you tell me?

276
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,550
I wasn't sure.

277
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:06,137
My mother was just a witness in the case.

278
00:30:07,471 --> 00:30:09,849
Her body wasn't found
after she went missing.

279
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:14,353
So that's why you worked day and night

280
00:30:15,062 --> 00:30:17,106
to find the missing persons.

281
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:21,861
Let's take you off the case.

282
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:26,407
Give it to Ms. Tak.

283
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:53,309
Go in.

284
00:30:53,392 --> 00:30:54,935
I know you have a lot of questions.

285
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,356
The case hasn't been transferred yet.

286
00:31:20,294 --> 00:31:21,879
Don't you have questions?

287
00:31:23,005 --> 00:31:24,507
"Why my mom?"

288
00:31:25,257 --> 00:31:26,801
"Why did you kill her?"

289
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:28,594
That's what you're going to ask.

290
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:32,264
Just do it. Don't waste time.

291
00:31:38,604 --> 00:31:40,064
So why did you kill her?

292
00:31:40,147 --> 00:31:42,316
Why did you have to do it on a snowy day?

293
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:48,030
I could've made memories with my mom.
Why did it have to be that day?

294
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,617
You're making this woman
with no son so sad.

295
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:54,161
You think having no son,
family, or parents,

296
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,705
made your life turn out this way?

297
00:31:56,622 --> 00:31:58,541
We decide our own fates.

298
00:31:58,624 --> 00:32:00,793
You did this to yourself.

299
00:32:06,632 --> 00:32:08,634
You think you know my life?

300
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:09,885
Do you?

301
00:32:10,636 --> 00:32:11,512
You know nothing.

302
00:32:11,595 --> 00:32:13,431
No matter how low I sink,

303
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,225
I'd never become scum like you.

304
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,853
You should've lived like a decent human.

305
00:32:22,481 --> 00:32:24,066
Hey, Hui-jin.

306
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:29,113
You died without getting to see
your precious son.

307
00:32:29,196 --> 00:32:30,364
Poor you.

308
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,575
You must be so resentful.

309
00:32:39,498 --> 00:32:40,666
ROYAL COFFEEHOUSE

310
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,917
Hey.

311
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:44,086
I'll call you back.

312
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,671
Why do you look so out of it?

313
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:48,674
I think I saw a lunatic.
He was dragging a woman away.

314
00:32:50,926 --> 00:32:52,845
I'll work really hard.

315
00:32:53,512 --> 00:32:55,389
Even a little glimpse is enough.

316
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:58,100
I didn't see anything.
I couldn't see anything.

317
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,770
Jeez, I shouldn't have told
the detectives.

318
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:02,313
Want me to talk to Detective No?

319
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,448
I'll tell you what I saw that night.

320
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,952
How about we make a snowman?

321
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,788
I'll be home soon.

322
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,336
What on earth?

323
00:33:25,419 --> 00:33:27,713
- You didn't go home?
- It looks like snow.

324
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,507
Go straight home.

325
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,175
Damn it.

326
00:33:31,258 --> 00:33:33,761
I never should've said
I'd give a statement.

327
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,560
I really don't know anything.

328
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,771
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

329
00:33:48,567 --> 00:33:52,655
Your mom called out for you so much.

330
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:56,867
Not only did you wait all night
but you also waited for decades?

331
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,912
Want to know the last thing your mom said

332
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,206
as she died?

333
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,835
"Eun-sim."

334
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:08,045
"I'm sorry."

335
00:34:08,712 --> 00:34:09,964
Eun-sim.

336
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:11,423
I'm sorry.

337
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:15,177
I didn't tell anyone.

338
00:34:17,721 --> 00:34:19,890
"Ji-ung's been waiting all night."

339
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,559
I made a promise…

340
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,812
to Ji-ung.

341
00:34:44,748 --> 00:34:47,793
"I made a promise to Ji-ung."

342
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:55,968
"Please don't kill me."

343
00:34:57,219 --> 00:35:01,473
"Please don't kill me!"

344
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:23,412
That's right.

345
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,082
I waited 20 years.

346
00:35:29,501 --> 00:35:31,003
But this is all you've got?

347
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,505
Just pay for your sins.

348
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,188
Mr. Gye.

349
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:05,496
Here.

350
00:36:06,163 --> 00:36:07,414
Herbal cigarettes.

351
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:12,628
After that day, I became a chain smoker.

352
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,673
Then, I thought,
"Gosh, this will kill me one day."

353
00:36:16,298 --> 00:36:17,299
And I got by with those.

354
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:21,845
If I had arrived
just a bit earlier that day…

355
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:26,308
If I had made
that right turn a bit faster…

356
00:36:26,892 --> 00:36:27,726
No.

357
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:31,563
I should've got out of the car and ran.

358
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,068
I've regretted it every day.

359
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,364
I know they're pointless regrets.

360
00:36:59,925 --> 00:37:02,302
DETENTION CENTER

361
00:37:04,471 --> 00:37:06,557
The statute of limitations has expired.

362
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,350
But for the murders of Ko Na-heun

363
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,019
and Na Ok-hui,

364
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,479
and for attempting to kill me,

365
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,149
she'll receive at least a life sentence.

366
00:37:17,943 --> 00:37:19,069
Thank you.

367
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:23,449
You kept your promise.

368
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,706
I heard you're refusing treatment.

369
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,792
Think of your family on the outside,

370
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,627
and get the treatment, Dr. Baek.

371
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:38,088
Now, I can finally face

372
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,508
my children again.

373
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:55,939
I'm Lim Sun and I worked as an office aide
at Seohan District Prosecutors' Office.

374
00:37:56,523 --> 00:37:58,358
I helped Prosecutor Gye Ji-ung

375
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:01,278
investigate Ko Na-heun's murder case.

376
00:38:01,361 --> 00:38:05,282
I learned anonymous letters
were being sent to Mr. Cha's office,

377
00:38:05,365 --> 00:38:09,203
saying a senior public intern had lied
about their identity to get their job.

378
00:38:09,286 --> 00:38:11,580
The reason why I didn't report
the letter right away was

379
00:38:11,663 --> 00:38:13,040
when I was given my duties,

380
00:38:13,123 --> 00:38:16,293
I was told Mr. Cha usually receives
many threatening letters,

381
00:38:16,376 --> 00:38:18,962
so I was instructed to
filter them out in advance.

382
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:22,382
I believed that letter
was one of those threatening ones.

383
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,259
After learning of the letter,

384
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,096
we checked the facts together.

385
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:30,599
I learned the person being accused
was Na Ok-hui.

386
00:38:30,682 --> 00:38:31,767
Before reporting it,

387
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:34,144
I wanted to find out
if the accusations were true.

388
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:35,354
In that process,

389
00:38:35,437 --> 00:38:37,815
I received help from Lim Sun.

390
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:39,775
Through Mr. Ju Byeong-deok,

391
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:43,445
I confirmed that Na Ok-hui
was a fake identity.

392
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:46,949
However, Na Ok-hui
had already disappeared by then.

393
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,701
I WILL COOPERATE WITH INVESTIGATIONS

394
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:50,619
LIM SUN

395
00:38:50,702 --> 00:38:52,913
Their statements align perfectly.

396
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,748
Is that a problem?

397
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,334
They match almost too well.

398
00:38:57,417 --> 00:39:00,129
Also, do you know how many times
they said "by coincidence"?

399
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,255
I don't know.

400
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:03,465
When I read it earlier,

401
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:06,176
it didn't look like it'd be an issue.

402
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,470
It wouldn't be.

403
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,430
But something feels very off.

404
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,933
Come on. Everything's in our favor.

405
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,144
It's like having a feast laid before us.

406
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:18,814
All we need to do is eat.
It's a total gain for us!

407
00:39:21,775 --> 00:39:23,569
That's what bothers me the most.

408
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:28,073
You said it all worked out without issues.

409
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,658
Then, isn't that a good thing?

410
00:39:29,741 --> 00:39:31,285
That's the strange thing.

411
00:39:31,368 --> 00:39:32,202
What is?

412
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,787
I mean,

413
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:37,416
if they'd kept probing,
that could've caused problems.

414
00:39:37,499 --> 00:39:40,085
But it's strange how things moved on
without any issues.

415
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:44,214
Let it go now. Please.

416
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:46,175
Forget about that crazy bitch too, okay?

417
00:39:47,634 --> 00:39:51,638
Let's relax and wait.

418
00:39:52,931 --> 00:39:53,765
For what?

419
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:56,602
The culprit's been caught,
so you'll change back soon.

420
00:39:57,394 --> 00:40:00,022
That would've happened already then.

421
00:40:00,105 --> 00:40:00,939
True.

422
00:40:01,481 --> 00:40:02,524
You're right.

423
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:08,030
COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO
CALL ME

424
00:40:15,537 --> 00:40:18,040
How long are you going to
keep avoiding him for?

425
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,667
I can't avoid him forever.

426
00:40:22,502 --> 00:40:23,712
I have to end it.

427
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:25,714
Hey, wait.

428
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,467
I'm sure my aunt was identified.

429
00:40:30,093 --> 00:40:31,637
No matter what excuse I give,

430
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,388
it'll be strange.

431
00:40:34,848 --> 00:40:36,433
He'd never understand.

432
00:40:36,516 --> 00:40:38,560
Can't you just tell him the truth?

433
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,940
Who knew Aunt Sun
would show up like this?

434
00:40:45,275 --> 00:40:46,360
What I'm saying is

435
00:40:46,443 --> 00:40:50,280
it's such a relief
that she was even discovered.

436
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:51,323
But it's just…

437
00:40:52,532 --> 00:40:54,576
the timing wasn't all that great.

438
00:40:56,411 --> 00:40:57,829
I think it's all my fault.

439
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,665
No, it's not!

440
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:01,208
It's because of that crazy bitch!

441
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:03,001
Why would it be your fault?

442
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,461
Maybe

443
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,546
deep down,

444
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,674
it's what I wanted to believe.

445
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:12,344
Maybe I thought
my aunt wouldn't suddenly show up,

446
00:41:12,427 --> 00:41:17,266
and it'd be okay to live
with her name like this.

447
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,229
It's not your fault.

448
00:41:24,606 --> 00:41:25,899
It's all thanks to you.

449
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,442
Thanks to you,

450
00:41:28,568 --> 00:41:30,237
they were able to find everyone.

451
00:41:30,862 --> 00:41:33,198
Aunt Sun and Mr. Gye's mom.

452
00:41:39,621 --> 00:41:41,498
Even if others don't know,

453
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,293
I do.

454
00:41:47,462 --> 00:41:49,381
You did something incredible.

455
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:55,012
Also, I dare anyone
to point their finger at you!

456
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:58,181
I'll break each and every one
of those fingers!

457
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:00,142
You couldn't break anything
with those arms.

458
00:42:00,225 --> 00:42:02,185
I'll break them all!

459
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,521
Don't be ridiculous.

460
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:07,566
Stop it.

461
00:42:08,775 --> 00:42:09,943
I mean it, you brat!

462
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:16,616
Mi-jin,

463
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,493
I'm so proud

464
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:22,164
to have you as my friend.

465
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:27,002
I mean that 100%.

466
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,173
No, 50,000%.

467
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:33,633
Why are you crying?

468
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,386
Because you're crying.

469
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,349
Stop it.

470
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,061
Jeez.

471
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,645
We're out of makgeolli.

472
00:42:46,229 --> 00:42:47,481
Don't cry, okay?

473
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:04,664
ARE YOU OKAY? DON'T SKIP YOUR MEALS
I'LL WAIT FOR YOUR CALL

474
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:15,717
Mr. Gye.

475
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,803
Could you take a quick look at this?

476
00:43:18,553 --> 00:43:19,721
Yes, right here.

477
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:42,536
ARE YOU OKAY? DON'T SKIP YOUR MEALS
I'LL WAIT FOR YOUR CALL

478
00:43:52,879 --> 00:43:55,215
- PHO AGAIN? UNBELIEVABLE!
- YOU'RE DEAD, JU BYEONG-DEOK

479
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,511
SO HANDSOME

480
00:44:04,474 --> 00:44:07,394
Remember before when you asked me
to keep my promise?

481
00:44:07,477 --> 00:44:08,854
I'll keep that promise.

482
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:11,440
I'll protect you no matter what.

483
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:14,651
So put a little more trust in me,
even if you're worried.

484
00:44:17,028 --> 00:44:20,782
You have reasons and circumstances
you can't reveal. I understand.

485
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:23,743
Because you're the only person
I fully trust.

486
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:58,028
PROSECUTOR GYE JI-UNG

00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:22,135
ROOM 307
GYE JI-UNG, JU BYEONG-DEOK, LIM SUN

00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,631
DOGAVILL STUDIO APARTMENT

489
00:46:00,548 --> 00:46:02,968
Mi-jin! I told you to just sleep over.

490
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:04,219
It's fine.

491
00:46:04,302 --> 00:46:08,807
What if something else happens to you?

492
00:46:10,475 --> 00:46:11,810
Do you have any idea

493
00:46:11,893 --> 00:46:15,105
how much I've wanted to walk around
at night without any worries?

494
00:46:17,565 --> 00:46:18,942
I'm leaving. I'll call you.

495
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,242
- Call me when you get there.
- Okay.

496
00:46:27,325 --> 00:46:28,326
- Bye.
- Bye.

497
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,244
I'll call you.

498
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:31,329
Be careful.

499
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:32,247
Okay.

500
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:33,248
Call me!

501
00:46:33,331 --> 00:46:34,165
Got it.

502
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:40,922
Come on!

503
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:53,977
Well,

504
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:56,229
he did help.

505
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,944
- Who parks like this?
- Excuse me?

506
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:07,282
Just park in front of Dogavill.

507
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:10,160
If you'll allow it…

508
00:47:10,243 --> 00:47:11,578
- Thank you.
- Okay.

509
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:13,538
In return,

510
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:16,249
don't hit on me with your skills anymore.

511
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,584
My skills?

512
00:47:17,667 --> 00:47:19,294
Don't come out and flirt with me.

513
00:47:19,377 --> 00:47:21,838
Just go home and treat your wife better.

514
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,841
Wait, what are you talking about?

515
00:47:24,924 --> 00:47:26,259
I may not look it,

516
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,178
but I care a lot about ethics and morals.

517
00:47:28,261 --> 00:47:30,889
I'm not some hussy who messes
with someone else's man

518
00:47:30,972 --> 00:47:32,307
and gets in catfights!

519
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:36,311
"Someone else's man"? I'm a bachelor.
More specifically, an old bachelor.

520
00:47:36,394 --> 00:47:37,270
What?

521
00:47:38,646 --> 00:47:40,273
But Mi-jin… I mean,

522
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:41,399
my aunt said

523
00:47:41,983 --> 00:47:44,069
that you were married.

524
00:47:44,694 --> 00:47:46,696
That's what I've told publicly.

525
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,907
But there's a long
and sad story behind it.

526
00:47:49,532 --> 00:47:50,742
So you're not married?

527
00:47:53,703 --> 00:47:56,081
Two days wouldn't be enough
to tell you the full story.

528
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,333
I see.

529
00:47:59,292 --> 00:48:00,460
What should we do?

530
00:48:00,543 --> 00:48:03,171
Should we go inside
and talk about that story then?

531
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:05,715
We can have some ramyun.

532
00:48:07,967 --> 00:48:09,344
- Ramyun?
- Ramyun.

533
00:48:11,846 --> 00:48:12,806
Okay.

534
00:48:14,015 --> 00:48:15,725
You can park there. I'll help.

535
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,143
- No, that's fine.
- Okay.

536
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,729
Get in. We can go for a drive first.

537
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,022
That sounds good.

538
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:22,690
I'll get the door!

539
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,442
How long have you been waiting?

540
00:49:06,192 --> 00:49:07,318
Not long.

541
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:11,072
Where were you? What were you doing?

542
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:12,115
It's late.

543
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:13,825
Well, just…

544
00:49:15,368 --> 00:49:17,912
I wanted to walk around at night in peace.

545
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:24,669
But why have you been avoiding me lately?

546
00:49:37,515 --> 00:49:38,850
I have something to tell you.

547
00:49:40,643 --> 00:49:43,271
You've asked several times,
but I couldn't answer.

548
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,483
It's about what I do for work

549
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:49,986
and why we can't meet during the day.

550
00:49:50,945 --> 00:49:51,905
You don't have to.

551
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:53,198
No.

552
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:55,658
It's been so hard each time
I've had to hide it from you.

553
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:57,327
I just want to tell you everything now.

554
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:02,790
What I'm trying to say is…

555
00:50:04,667 --> 00:50:05,627
The thing is…

556
00:50:06,377 --> 00:50:07,837
The fact that you're Lim Sun?

557
00:50:13,426 --> 00:50:14,302
Or…

558
00:50:15,261 --> 00:50:16,930
that Lim Sun is Lee Mi-jin?

559
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,101
How did you know?

560
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,896
No, since when?

561
00:50:27,815 --> 00:50:29,234
I saw everything that day.

562
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:44,123
Despite seeing it for myself,
I couldn't believe it.

563
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:57,345
"Was I mistaken?"

564
00:50:58,471 --> 00:51:00,014
"Did I hallucinate?"

565
00:51:03,184 --> 00:51:04,519
But the more I thought about it,

566
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,105
the more everything made sense.

567
00:51:08,314 --> 00:51:10,316
Your whereabouts

568
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:12,944
and Ms. Lim's strange behavior.

569
00:51:13,861 --> 00:51:15,488
"So that's why all of that happened."

570
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:18,533
It took me some time to understand that.

571
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,791
You should've just told me. If you had--

572
00:51:26,874 --> 00:51:28,167
How could I tell you?

573
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:33,881
It's the side of me I least want to show
to the person I care about the most.

574
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:36,801
How could I tell you that?

575
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:40,555
Still, if you really had trusted me,
you should've told me.

576
00:51:40,638 --> 00:51:42,223
If I hadn't hidden it from you,

577
00:51:42,932 --> 00:51:45,893
I never would've even had
the opportunity to work with you.

578
00:51:47,228 --> 00:51:48,313
To me,

579
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:52,442
it was a job I could've never obtained
no matter how hard I tried.

580
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:55,737
But strangely enough,
I got the opportunity

581
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:56,904
once I aged.

582
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:02,160
No matter how much I wished,
it was something I could never have.

583
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:09,125
That's why I couldn't quit
despite knowing it was wrong.

584
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,173
I'd already fallen in love with the job…

585
00:52:18,551 --> 00:52:22,221
and I loved coming to work
every morning to see you.

586
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:26,893
I was too scared to tell you the truth.

587
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:29,479
Still, you should've told me.

588
00:52:29,562 --> 00:52:32,899
If you did, you wouldn't have been put
in danger by Gong Gi-cheol.

589
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:35,360
Do you know how scared I was that day?

590
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:39,947
Do you know how much I regretted…

591
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:43,368
and blamed myself?

592
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:47,413
I promised that I'd protect you.

593
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,082
But I couldn't do anything.

594
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:53,086
I felt so pathetic. It drove me crazy.

595
00:53:05,139 --> 00:53:08,434
I think it's only right that I take
responsibility for my actions.

596
00:53:13,147 --> 00:53:14,190
Let's break up.

597
00:53:20,154 --> 00:53:21,280
You want to break up?

598
00:53:22,323 --> 00:53:24,325
I can't stay and keep bringing you harm.

599
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:26,786
I know you tried to force
the case closed with my statement.

600
00:53:26,869 --> 00:53:28,746
That doesn't bother me at all.

601
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:29,664
But I'm…

602
00:53:29,747 --> 00:53:31,374
I'm not okay with it.

603
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:34,001
I don't want to stay

604
00:53:34,752 --> 00:53:38,005
and burden you with my situation.

605
00:53:45,012 --> 00:53:46,180
Then, what about me?

606
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:51,853
I've never liked anyone like this before.

607
00:53:52,937 --> 00:53:54,689
What will you do about my feelings?

608
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:11,205
I'll go now.

609
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:56,394
A tip?

610
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:58,104
What tip?

611
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:00,940
Come on, Mr. Cha.

612
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,985
I heard the crucial factor

613
00:56:04,068 --> 00:56:07,613
in catching the killer
was senior public intern, Lim Sun.

614
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:10,116
There was a lot of talk of that
at the police station too.

615
00:56:10,741 --> 00:56:11,617
Come on.

616
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:13,703
In any case, she's already quit.

617
00:56:13,786 --> 00:56:16,247
Nothing good can come
from stirring things up.

618
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:17,206
Still,

619
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:19,750
I can't write about things
that didn't happen.

620
00:56:21,168 --> 00:56:24,088
Not speaking about what did happen

621
00:56:24,171 --> 00:56:26,090
wouldn't cause problems though, right?

622
00:56:26,173 --> 00:56:27,592
Yes, come in.

623
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,553
What? Aren't you Ko Won?

624
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:33,764
Wow, I can't believe
I get to meet you here.

625
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:35,349
Can I shake your hand?

626
00:56:36,225 --> 00:56:37,268
I'm a fan.

627
00:56:38,519 --> 00:56:40,521
Wait a second!

628
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:43,816
Wasn't Lim Sun the person
who saved you on your first day here?

629
00:56:46,527 --> 00:56:48,571
- You may go.
- Can I get an interview?

630
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:50,281
It'll just take a second.

631
00:56:50,948 --> 00:56:54,827
Why feel the need to discuss things
if one doesn't want to?

632
00:56:55,494 --> 00:56:57,872
- It's just as Mr. Cha said.
- That's right.

633
00:57:00,207 --> 00:57:01,042
I'll be on my way.

634
00:57:01,125 --> 00:57:02,752
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

635
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,713
Come on.

636
00:57:05,796 --> 00:57:08,090
- Come here.
- I almost had a good story.

637
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:10,885
Look.

638
00:57:10,968 --> 00:57:12,845
What's on the indictment
is all that happened.

639
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,639
There's nothing more.

640
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:16,015
Nothing.

641
00:57:16,557 --> 00:57:19,310
WITNESS STATEMENT
KO WON

642
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,521
So you're saying

643
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:26,150
the victim Lim Sun has the same name
as our former senior intern?

644
00:57:26,233 --> 00:57:27,234
No, wait.

645
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:29,111
They're the same person… No.

646
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:31,197
- So--
- No, wait!

647
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,242
So Lim Sun lied
about her identity to work here.

648
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:36,285
He wants to take all that out, right?

649
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:37,203
Yes, sir.

650
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,956
That little punk.

651
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:41,040
So,

652
00:57:41,707 --> 00:57:45,253
the fake Lim Sun disgraced the prosecution
by conning us to get hired.

653
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:47,046
And if we don't stay quiet,

654
00:57:47,129 --> 00:57:51,259
Gye Ji-ung will reveal
not only did the fake Lim Sun deceive us

655
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:54,679
but she also caught the criminal
by herself, making us look like fools?

656
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:55,596
Yes, sir.

657
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,098
That little punk!

658
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,600
He is so stubborn.

659
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:02,603
Damn it.

660
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:04,105
Mr. Cha,

661
00:58:04,188 --> 00:58:07,024
Gye Ji-ung will be called up
to Seoul soon.

662
00:58:08,609 --> 00:58:09,443
He's leaving?

663
00:58:14,031 --> 00:58:15,741
Proceed with the indictment as is.

664
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:17,285
What?

665
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:19,453
Just do as Gye Ji-ung says!

666
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:20,663
All right, now!

667
00:58:21,872 --> 00:58:23,082
He wants it covered up. Do it.

668
00:58:23,165 --> 00:58:24,250
Mr. Cha.

669
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:25,960
- All right, now!
- Mr. Cha!

670
00:58:28,879 --> 00:58:30,798
I need to send that punk away quickly.

671
00:58:30,881 --> 00:58:32,675
I'm so sick of him.

672
00:58:54,655 --> 00:58:55,740
Drink this too.

673
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:03,831
By the way,

674
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:06,375
I still can't reach

675
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:08,002
the kid's mom.

676
00:59:15,676 --> 00:59:16,677
They found her.

677
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:19,805
They did?

678
00:59:20,931 --> 00:59:21,766
Yes.

679
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:23,267
Goodness, hold on.

680
00:59:23,934 --> 00:59:25,227
Good grief.

681
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,521
- What's wrong?
- Let go. I need to leave.

682
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:29,357
You can't go anywhere in your condition.

683
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,734
I have to let her son know.

684
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:33,319
That little punk.

685
00:59:33,402 --> 00:59:36,364
He furiously begged me every day
to find his mother.

686
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:38,240
I should hurry and let him know.

687
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:40,409
He'll love it.

688
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:41,827
Wait a second.

689
00:59:42,411 --> 00:59:43,579
I'll take these too

690
00:59:44,288 --> 00:59:45,456
and give them to him.

691
00:59:49,543 --> 00:59:51,837
Thank you!

692
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:16,821
Honey.

693
01:00:17,446 --> 01:00:18,906
You have to eat something.

694
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:23,494
The living have to keep on living.

695
01:00:23,577 --> 01:00:25,037
You can't starve to death.

696
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:32,837
They called us
and said they identified Sun.

697
01:00:33,587 --> 01:00:37,466
All that was left were bones.
How could that be Sun?

698
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:38,384
How?

699
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:41,887
Do you remember?

700
01:00:42,471 --> 01:00:44,890
Sun was in such good health.

701
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,434
She was smart too.

702
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:48,519
So how can you say

703
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:50,688
that was Sun?

704
01:00:50,771 --> 01:00:51,856
No, it's not her.

705
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:53,649
It doesn't make sense.

706
01:00:54,733 --> 01:00:56,360
She grew up without her parents.

707
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:59,613
Our poor Sun grew up without their love.

708
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:01,365
I did all I could to raise her.

709
01:01:02,324 --> 01:01:03,993
You know that.

710
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:07,246
But all they brought back
were those thin bones.

711
01:01:07,329 --> 01:01:10,583
How is that Sun? How?

712
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:13,878
No, it can't be.

713
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:18,090
I can't just sit here.

714
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:19,091
What is it?

715
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:20,968
Honey, I have to see Mr. Gye.

716
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:23,220
Last time at the station,

717
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:24,889
I'm sure he said it was Sun.

718
01:01:25,681 --> 01:01:26,599
I have to go.

719
01:01:26,682 --> 01:01:27,975
- Let's go.
- Honey.

720
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:29,310
Jeez!

721
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:32,688
Mom.

722
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:35,941
Don't go.

723
01:01:37,109 --> 01:01:37,943
You.

724
01:01:41,655 --> 01:01:42,656
You…

725
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:46,035
You're Sun, right?

726
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:49,246
Are you Sun?

727
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:50,164
Honey.

728
01:01:50,247 --> 01:01:52,082
Wait a second, honey.

729
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:54,043
You're Sun, aren't you?

730
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:55,669
Right?

731
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:02,176
Sun.

732
01:02:03,177 --> 01:02:04,470
You're her, aren't you?

733
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:06,972
Right, Sun?

734
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:09,850
See, honey! I told you Sun was alive.

735
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:12,353
She's standing right here alive.
She's not dead!

736
01:02:12,436 --> 01:02:13,270
Sun.

737
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:15,731
Where have you been all this time?

738
01:02:15,814 --> 01:02:18,776
Where were you?
You've been doing okay, right?

739
01:02:19,401 --> 01:02:22,696
You came because you missed me,
but I didn't recognize you.

740
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:25,199
I kept kicking you out
and chasing you away.

741
01:02:25,282 --> 01:02:26,158
I'm so sorry.

742
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:27,368
I'm sorry.

743
01:02:27,451 --> 01:02:29,203
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

744
01:02:29,286 --> 01:02:30,621
I'm not Aunt Sun.

745
01:02:32,581 --> 01:02:33,749
I'm Mi-jin.

746
01:02:35,417 --> 01:02:36,794
What are you talking about?

747
01:02:37,294 --> 01:02:40,589
What is it?
Are you mad I didn't recognize you?

748
01:02:40,673 --> 01:02:41,632
I'm so sorry.

749
01:02:41,715 --> 01:02:43,425
I'm really sorry.

750
01:02:44,301 --> 01:02:46,053
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

751
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,097
I'm sorry, Sun.

752
01:02:49,723 --> 01:02:51,141
Gosh, Mom.

753
01:03:01,193 --> 01:03:02,861
Sun.

754
01:03:03,737 --> 01:03:05,406
I'm so sorry.

755
01:03:15,749 --> 01:03:16,667
Dad.

756
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:31,932
Mi-jin?

757
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:33,142
What?

758
01:03:43,444 --> 01:03:44,653
- You…
- Mi-jin?

759
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:25,653
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

760
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:28,697
I didn't know just how much I liked…

761
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:31,992
I only realized after it was gone.

762
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:35,245
What do you mean "farewell"?
Farewell?

763
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:38,540
I have to do whatever I can
to return to my original state.

764
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:41,210
For my mom and dad.

765
01:04:41,877 --> 01:04:45,297
Thanks to you,
I know what I want to do now.

766
01:04:47,257 --> 01:04:48,217
I'll get going.

767
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:52,388
Do you think I can be brave again?

768
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:56,392
You were able to do it because it was you.

769
01:04:57,017 --> 01:04:59,019
Only you could've done it.

770
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:07,820
