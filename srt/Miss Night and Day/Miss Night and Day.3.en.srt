Yes.

26
00:04:23,937 --> 00:04:25,813
Did you see that car's license plate?

27
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,690
No.

28
00:04:29,442 --> 00:04:31,694
It was a silver SUV.

29
00:04:33,363 --> 00:04:36,199
Did you run here? Why were you running?

30
00:04:36,282 --> 00:04:37,575

31
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:39,786
how can you just send a text and leave?

32
00:04:39,869 --> 00:04:40,745
Jeez.

33
00:04:41,663 --> 00:04:43,831
You're the one
who vanished without a text.

34
00:04:45,249 --> 00:04:46,084
Forget it.

35
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:47,794
It's late, so let's go together.

36
00:04:50,046 --> 00:04:51,047
Don't tell me.

37
00:04:51,756 --> 00:04:52,924
Because it's dangerous?

38
00:04:53,549 --> 00:04:55,551
I even know every tree
in this neighborhood.

39
00:04:58,096 --> 00:04:59,555
I found your documents.

40
00:05:08,398 --> 00:05:10,650
They flew out
when the car suddenly stopped.

41
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:13,319
Still, your papers are okay.

42
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,571
They're a bit crumpled though.

43
00:05:25,581 --> 00:05:26,999
<i>Judging by the skid marks,</i>

44
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,711
<i>the driver was going over at least 60 kmh.</i>

45
00:05:30,712 --> 00:05:32,505
<i>There's a high chance it was the culprit.</i>

46
00:05:35,508 --> 00:05:37,343
Was that car from this neighborhood?

47
00:05:37,427 --> 00:05:39,512
Every other family has a silver SUV here.

48
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:42,807
Was anything suspicious?

49
00:05:44,183 --> 00:05:46,686
I don't know. It happened so fast.

50
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:48,479
Still, try to think.

51
00:05:49,188 --> 00:05:50,440
Even something small will help.

52
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,741
There was a strange smell.

53
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,617
What smell?

54
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:03,327
A smell I've never smelled before.

55
00:06:04,036 --> 00:06:05,955
<i>The smell of blood or a corpse.</i>

56
00:06:06,497 --> 00:06:08,332
By any chance, was it fishy or bad?

57
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,168
It wasn't like that.

58
00:06:10,668 --> 00:06:14,297
It was more unique than unpleasant.

59
00:06:16,007 --> 00:06:17,216
Was it an air freshener?

60
00:06:23,556 --> 00:06:24,766
Where is she?

61
00:06:27,727 --> 00:06:29,771
She's coming!

62
00:06:41,282 --> 00:06:44,410
Go on in. If anything happens,
make sure to call me.

63
00:06:44,494 --> 00:06:45,328
Okay.

64
00:07:05,098 --> 00:07:06,015
Jeez, you scared me.

65
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:07,433
- Hey!
- Hey!

66
00:07:07,517 --> 00:07:08,851
What are you doing this late?

67
00:07:09,435 --> 00:07:11,479
What about you? Why were you out so late?

68
00:07:12,063 --> 00:07:13,689
Fine, I'll be home earlier next time.

69
00:07:13,773 --> 00:07:15,024
That's not what I meant.

70
00:07:15,733 --> 00:07:17,985
I'm not complaining about you being late.

71
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:19,612
What matters is who you were with.

72
00:07:21,614 --> 00:07:22,490
I'm going inside.

73
00:07:25,827 --> 00:07:28,996
Mi-jin, who were you with
and what were you doing?

74
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,666
Why are you being like this too, Dad?
Come on.

75
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:33,084
- I'm going in.
- Okay.

76
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:44,595
My back!

77
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:45,930
Good grief.

78
00:07:46,013 --> 00:07:47,598
What a long day.

79
00:07:47,682 --> 00:07:48,933

Thank you so much.

138
00:12:52,778 --> 00:12:55,906
She saved someone's life.
Doesn't she deserve another prize?

139
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,783
Of course, we have plans for that.

140
00:12:57,867 --> 00:13:00,536
Yes, we're considering what it should be.

Since we're here for this happy occasion,
I have some more good news to share.

142
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:08,544
We have a new intern
who will take over for Ko Na-heun.

00:13:08,627 --> 00:13:11,005
Mr. Baek Cheol-gyu,
come out and say hello.

144
00:13:18,053 --> 00:13:19,430
It's nice to meet you.

145
00:13:20,055 --> 00:13:21,932
My name is Baek Cheol-gyu.

146
00:13:22,016 --> 00:13:24,768
But Ko Na-heun left just recently.

147
00:13:24,852 --> 00:13:25,895
You already hired someone?

148
00:13:25,978 --> 00:13:28,397
Already? He's been absent
without notice for a week.

149
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,940
He's caused so much trouble.

150
00:13:30,024 --> 00:13:31,358
What's he saying?

151
00:13:31,442 --> 00:13:34,111
Mr. Baek is the director
of Hwadong Medical Center.

152
00:13:34,195 --> 00:13:35,404
- What?
- Goodness!

153
00:13:35,487 --> 00:13:37,406
Sir, I had no idea.

154
00:13:38,908 --> 00:13:41,410
I'm flattered, but that was ages ago.

155
00:13:41,911 --> 00:13:43,162
You don't have to say "sir."

156
00:13:44,163 --> 00:13:46,123
- Director?
- A round of applause, please.

157
00:13:56,342 --> 00:13:58,677
What's with you now? What is it?

158
00:14:00,054 --> 00:14:01,805
What's the problem?

159
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:03,891
How interesting.

160
00:14:04,558 --> 00:14:07,978
Why would a hospital director
want to come here to work?

161
00:14:08,062 --> 00:14:09,438
What's wrong with our work?

162
00:14:09,939 --> 00:14:12,525
I made billions in profit back in my day.

163
00:14:12,608 --> 00:14:14,735
And I had dozens of employees.

164
00:14:14,818 --> 00:14:16,904
Still, I see what he means.

165
00:14:16,987 --> 00:14:20,783
People with nothing
had to fight to get this job.

166
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:23,285
But he has everything,
so it's strange he'd come here.

167
00:14:25,454 --> 00:14:27,998
What? I don't mind.

168
00:14:28,624 --> 00:14:31,126
We're a bunch of nobodies
as public works interns,

169
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,628
but he's increased our prestige.

170
00:14:33,212 --> 00:14:34,672
To put it bluntly,

171
00:14:34,755 --> 00:14:36,465
did he increase our prestige?

172
00:14:36,549 --> 00:14:37,591
It was Ms. Lim

173
00:14:37,675 --> 00:14:39,885
who increased it by saving a life.

174
00:14:40,594 --> 00:14:42,346
Take a look at this.

176
00:14:45,849 --> 00:14:47,226
It was nothing.

177
00:14:47,851 --> 00:14:49,812
Yeah, it was nothing.

178
00:14:49,895 --> 00:14:52,648
I used to move around quick
at her age too.

179
00:14:52,731 --> 00:14:56,485
True. If I was just ten years younger,
then I'd also…

180
00:14:56,569 --> 00:14:59,780
I see you in a new light now, Ms. Lim.

181
00:14:59,863 --> 00:15:03,033
With those kind of guts,
you could've been a cop.

182
00:15:03,117 --> 00:15:05,911
Why have you let
such skills go to waste until now?

183
00:15:07,913 --> 00:15:10,791
I heard the guy you saved

184
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:14,420
happened to be a huge star
even among celebrities.

185
00:15:15,045 --> 00:15:17,631
Do you think
we might benefit from this too?

186
00:15:17,715 --> 00:15:20,175
Gosh, I didn't do it
expecting anything in return.

187
00:15:20,884 --> 00:15:23,554
Why not? Maybe a little something, right?

188
00:15:23,637 --> 00:15:29,143
DOGAVILL STUDIO APARTMENT
ROOMS FOR RENT

189
00:15:31,103 --> 00:15:34,440
Just leave it by the door, please!

190
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:36,692
Excuse me!

191
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,864
You can just leave it by the door and go!

192
00:15:45,576 --> 00:15:47,411
Jeez!

193
00:15:50,414 --> 00:15:51,749
Just leave it by the door.

194
00:15:51,832 --> 00:15:54,209
<i>I'm sorry, but can you open the door?</i>

195
00:15:54,293 --> 00:15:55,586
<i>There's a lot of stuff.</i>

196
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:58,088
<i>I'm Ko Won's manager.</i>

197
00:15:58,172 --> 00:15:59,423
What is he talking about?

198
00:16:02,551 --> 00:16:03,636
- Hello.
- Hi.

199
00:16:11,018 --> 00:16:13,020
What is all of this?

200
00:16:13,103 --> 00:16:14,438
There's still more.

201
00:16:17,608 --> 00:16:18,442
What?

202
00:16:18,984 --> 00:16:20,694
These are gifts from Ko Won to thank you.

203
00:16:22,863 --> 00:16:24,323
The car's outside.

204
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:27,076
What are you talking about?

205
00:16:30,245 --> 00:16:31,330
Seriously?

206
00:16:31,747 --> 00:16:33,415
This is ridiculous.

207
00:16:43,842 --> 00:16:44,843
Wait.

208
00:16:45,594 --> 00:16:46,428
Is that…

209
00:16:46,512 --> 00:16:47,638
Is the Ko Won you mean

210
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:49,640
that Ko Won?

211
00:16:50,224 --> 00:16:53,018
- Yes, that's right.
- But why would he give me this?

212
00:16:53,102 --> 00:16:54,687
Not you, but your mother.

213
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:55,771
What?

214
00:16:57,606 --> 00:16:59,024
- I don't have a mom.
- What?

215
00:17:00,484 --> 00:17:02,695
Isn't this where Lim Sun lives?

216
00:17:03,904 --> 00:17:05,114
Lim Sun?

217
00:17:30,973 --> 00:17:33,058
PROSECUTOR GYE JI-UNG

218
00:18:02,546 --> 00:18:04,339
I didn't get a chance to thank him.

219
00:18:46,924 --> 00:18:47,966
So it was new.

220
00:19:31,218 --> 00:19:32,302
What's up?

221
00:19:36,682 --> 00:19:39,226
Hey, I can explain everything.

222
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:41,228
The thing is…

223
00:19:41,895 --> 00:19:43,522
What happened was…

224
00:19:44,314 --> 00:19:46,149
Just wait, okay?

225
00:19:48,068 --> 00:19:49,152
Damn it!

226
00:19:54,449 --> 00:19:55,993
<i>I don't know this lady!</i>

227
00:19:56,076 --> 00:19:57,744
Get out. Who are you, lady?

228
00:19:57,828 --> 00:19:59,329
- I'm their daughter.
- No, she's not!

229
00:19:59,413 --> 00:20:00,581
She's not our daughter!

230
00:20:00,664 --> 00:20:02,165
This is insane!

231
00:20:02,249 --> 00:20:03,333
I'm your daughter!

232
00:20:21,852 --> 00:20:23,854
- Is that you, Mi-jin?
- Yeah, it's me.

233
00:20:23,937 --> 00:20:25,772
Open the door. There's so much.

234
00:20:27,065 --> 00:20:29,359
- What is this?
- I'll tell you the whole story.

235
00:20:29,443 --> 00:20:30,777
What?

236
00:20:30,861 --> 00:20:32,446
Why did you bring this in?

237
00:20:32,529 --> 00:20:34,281
Just put it back outside.

238
00:20:34,364 --> 00:20:36,199
I told you on the phone earlier.

239
00:20:36,283 --> 00:20:37,242
I've changed a lot.

240
00:20:37,326 --> 00:20:39,161
My gosh! What in the world?

241
00:20:39,244 --> 00:20:40,495
Get out!

242
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:41,872
I'm Mi-jin!

243
00:20:41,955 --> 00:20:43,457
Hey! Damn.

244
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,460
Hey, you of all people have to believe me.

245
00:20:47,711 --> 00:20:50,130
I know all the guys
who've dumped you so far.

246
00:20:50,213 --> 00:20:52,883
Baek Seo-woo, Choi Jin-yeong,
Lee Yeong-min, Nam Jeong-woo.

247
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,718
Yu Jun-gyeong!

248
00:20:57,638 --> 00:20:58,764
How did you know that?

249
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,974
- Because--
- Also, lady…

250
00:21:02,184 --> 00:21:04,186
I dumped Baek Seo-woo and Lee Yeong-min.

251
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,813
Either way, I know your passcode too.

252
00:21:14,863 --> 00:21:18,116
I'm Lee Mi-jin.

253
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:20,661
I think I've been possessed.

254
00:21:23,413 --> 00:21:25,123
This is my bag.

255
00:21:25,207 --> 00:21:27,334
- That's Mi-jin's bag.
- Yeah, it's my bag.

256
00:21:27,417 --> 00:21:28,710
How is it your bag, lady?

257
00:21:28,794 --> 00:21:30,671
These are my mom's clothes. Remember?

258
00:21:30,754 --> 00:21:31,838
Those are her mom's.

259
00:21:31,922 --> 00:21:33,423
Yeah, my mom's clothes.

260
00:21:33,507 --> 00:21:36,468
- Your mom?
- My birthday's March 16, 1996.

261
00:21:36,551 --> 00:21:38,011
Your birthday's October 3rd.

262
00:21:38,095 --> 00:21:39,137
Your dad's Do Pyeon-gang!

263
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:41,515
You know I'm right!

264
00:21:41,598 --> 00:21:42,724
- You're right.
- Right?

265
00:21:42,808 --> 00:21:43,976
How did you know that?

266
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:45,519
Because I'm Mi-jin!

267
00:21:45,602 --> 00:21:47,771
- So you're…
- I'm Mi-jin.

268
00:21:47,854 --> 00:21:49,064
- My friend, Mi-jin?
- Yes.

269
00:21:49,147 --> 00:21:50,315
Then, where is she now?

270
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:51,984
Seriously!

271
00:21:53,068 --> 00:21:55,445
Were you even listening this whole time?

272
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:59,366
I become like this when the sun rises,
and I turn back to normal at sundown.

273
00:22:00,826 --> 00:22:02,411
This is driving me crazy.

274
00:22:02,494 --> 00:22:04,913
What are you talking about?
This lady's crazy.

275
00:22:06,206 --> 00:22:07,666
Where did you go, Mi-jin?

276
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:09,751
See?

277
00:22:11,545 --> 00:22:12,879
GA-YEONG

278
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:16,091
Damn it.

279
00:22:16,174 --> 00:22:17,134
You believe me now?

280
00:22:17,217 --> 00:22:20,011
So is this like what they call

281
00:22:20,637 --> 00:22:22,639
organ trafficking or something?

282
00:22:24,307 --> 00:22:26,184
- What?
- Is this voice phishing?

283
00:22:26,268 --> 00:22:28,270
Where's Mi-jin?

284
00:22:28,353 --> 00:22:30,272
- I said I'm Mi-jin!
- Poor Mi-jin!

285
00:22:30,355 --> 00:22:31,273
Who are you calling?

286
00:22:31,356 --> 00:22:33,191
- Your phone…
- Wait. Don't touch me!

287
00:22:33,275 --> 00:22:35,986
Jeez, lady! Don't touch me!

288
00:22:36,069 --> 00:22:37,571
Lady, are you for real?

289
00:22:37,654 --> 00:22:39,948
Hey! Why are you so strong?

290
00:22:40,031 --> 00:22:43,034
- What is this?
- This is insane!

291
00:22:43,118 --> 00:22:46,455
I don't know why I keep changing either!

292
00:22:47,247 --> 00:22:49,624
Since when were your arms this strong?

293
00:22:50,709 --> 00:22:51,918
Is this a hidden camera prank?

294
00:22:52,002 --> 00:22:54,546
- Mi-jin!
- Yeah?

295
00:22:54,629 --> 00:22:55,797
Come out, Mi-jin.

296
00:22:55,881 --> 00:22:57,382
- I'm right here.
- Lee Mi-jin…

297
00:22:59,176 --> 00:23:00,469
I said I'm Mi-jin.

298
00:23:00,552 --> 00:23:02,554
How are you Mi-jin, lady?

299
00:23:03,388 --> 00:23:07,225
You want me to hit you
and mess up your fillers?

300
00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:08,894
Jeez, that hurts.

301
00:23:09,644 --> 00:23:11,021
No one knows about this.

302
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:14,107
Of course not! Just the two of us went.
It was a two-for-one deal.

303
00:23:14,691 --> 00:23:16,401
I got laser treatment. You got fillers.

304
00:23:16,485 --> 00:23:18,820
I didn't want to go,
but you said it was cheap.

305
00:23:18,904 --> 00:23:20,822
You coaxed me into it for the ad deal!

306
00:23:21,281 --> 00:23:22,866
Take a look. Down here.

307
00:23:22,949 --> 00:23:25,702
I still have the burn mark. Do you see it?

308
00:23:26,536 --> 00:23:27,579
Right?

309
00:23:27,662 --> 00:23:29,915
I have the emotional scars
because of you too.

310
00:23:36,129 --> 00:23:37,506
Damn it! Don't!

311
00:23:38,381 --> 00:23:39,424
Stop it!

312
00:23:40,133 --> 00:23:41,092
Don't!

313
00:23:42,052 --> 00:23:43,428
I said stop it!

314
00:23:43,512 --> 00:23:45,013
You're Mi-jin, but…

315
00:23:45,096 --> 00:23:46,181
How could you be her?

316
00:23:46,264 --> 00:23:49,184
- Take a look.
- This makes no sense!

317
00:23:49,267 --> 00:23:52,687
What is this? This is ridiculous!
What are you talking about?

318
00:23:52,771 --> 00:23:54,898
All this talking
is just wasting by breath.

319
00:23:57,442 --> 00:23:59,194
Hey, the sun's setting.

320
00:23:59,277 --> 00:24:01,530
- Come take a look.
- Don't touch me, lady!

321
00:24:01,613 --> 00:24:03,114
- Okay!
- What will you do to me?

322
00:24:03,198 --> 00:24:04,491
Okay! Just wait!

323
00:24:05,075 --> 00:24:06,159
When the sun sets,

324
00:24:06,243 --> 00:24:08,328
I'm going to change. Just wait.

325
00:24:09,204 --> 00:24:10,705
Take a look! Watch!

326
00:24:11,998 --> 00:24:14,167
- It's setting.
- Do I have to wait for this?

327
00:24:14,251 --> 00:24:15,168
You can record it.

328
00:24:15,877 --> 00:24:17,462
- Save it to your phone.
- Okay.

329
00:24:17,546 --> 00:24:18,964
I need evidence anyway.

330
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,424
Don't be surprised.

331
00:24:22,467 --> 00:24:23,468
Whatever.

332
00:24:24,177 --> 00:24:25,262
Change, my foot.

333
00:24:42,195 --> 00:24:43,405
Holy crap!

334
00:24:43,488 --> 00:24:44,906
- Gosh!
- Are you okay?

335
00:24:46,324 --> 00:24:48,118
I knew it'd scare her. I knew it.

336
00:24:50,495 --> 00:24:51,872
Holy cow!

337
00:24:57,794 --> 00:24:58,795
Is that you, Mi-jin?

338
00:24:58,879 --> 00:24:59,921
Yeah, it's me!

339
00:25:00,005 --> 00:25:02,883
I said it's me! Can't you tell it's me?

340
00:25:02,966 --> 00:25:04,509
Don't I look different now?

341
00:25:05,093 --> 00:25:06,595
I'm telling you it's me.

342
00:25:15,103 --> 00:25:17,564
So that stray cat did this to you?

343
00:25:17,647 --> 00:25:19,274
I think so.

344
00:25:19,357 --> 00:25:21,401
And you took
your aunt's name for the alter ego…

345
00:25:21,484 --> 00:25:22,694
Lim Sun.

346
00:25:24,112 --> 00:25:25,530
ACID ATTACKER CAUGHT BY 50-YEAR-OLD

347
00:25:27,574 --> 00:25:29,826
And the lady who did this to Ko Won…

348
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:32,120
It was Lim Sun. It was me.

349
00:25:32,203 --> 00:25:34,247
How many times do I have to tell you?

350
00:25:34,331 --> 00:25:37,208
I said I think I ended up like this
because of that cat,

351
00:25:37,292 --> 00:25:40,003
and all of that was me, Lim Sun.

352
00:25:40,086 --> 00:25:42,422
No. If you were me, would you say,

353
00:25:42,505 --> 00:25:44,507
"I see. My friend Mi-jin

354
00:25:44,591 --> 00:25:46,635
just aged overnight like this."

355
00:25:46,718 --> 00:25:49,054
"But only during the day."
You'd believe that?

356
00:25:49,137 --> 00:25:50,764
Fine! Don't believe it then!

357
00:25:50,847 --> 00:25:53,016
- I don't!
- Fine!

358
00:25:57,312 --> 00:25:58,647
Seriously.

359
00:25:59,356 --> 00:26:04,653
So did you upload the video
about the missing cat or not?

360
00:26:06,696 --> 00:26:09,532
So that's why you asked me
to put that ad on my channel.

361
00:26:09,616 --> 00:26:10,700
Exactly!

362
00:26:10,784 --> 00:26:13,286
I get it now!

363
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:17,207
It's why you only came at night
and why you used my address as yours.

364
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:19,376
Hey.

365
00:26:20,293 --> 00:26:21,962
What if your parents find out?

366
00:26:22,045 --> 00:26:23,922
They absolutely can't find out.

367
00:26:24,005 --> 00:26:26,424
If they find out I was scammed,

368
00:26:26,508 --> 00:26:27,801
I'll die.

369
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:29,636
Your mom would execute you.

370
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:35,433
So just help me out
until I get better, okay?

371
00:26:35,517 --> 00:26:38,061
Okay. So we have to find that cat.

372
00:26:38,144 --> 00:26:39,270
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

373
00:26:39,354 --> 00:26:40,689
Okay, then.

374
00:26:40,772 --> 00:26:42,857
I'll visit animal shelters tomorrow.

375
00:26:42,941 --> 00:26:46,027
Thank you so much. I knew you'd help me.

376
00:26:46,111 --> 00:26:47,278
Thank you so much.

377
00:26:47,362 --> 00:26:50,323
Hey. Before I help you, handle that first.

378
00:26:51,616 --> 00:26:53,201
I mean, seriously…

379
00:26:54,202 --> 00:26:56,788
I know he's showering me with money…

380
00:26:57,998 --> 00:27:00,458
But isn't this too much?
I don't know about this.

381
00:27:00,542 --> 00:27:01,668
Hey.

382
00:27:01,751 --> 00:27:04,546
He earns billions a year
in royalties alone.

383
00:27:04,629 --> 00:27:05,839
He can do anything he wants.

384
00:27:05,922 --> 00:27:07,632
- Billions?
- Yeah.

385
00:27:08,675 --> 00:27:10,719
Wow, I'm so jealous.

386
00:27:20,645 --> 00:27:22,522
KO WON

387
00:27:26,609 --> 00:27:28,778
This is Seohan District
Prosecutors' Office.

388
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,748
This is more like a fan club meeting.

389
00:27:40,665 --> 00:27:42,876
- He's not even that impressive.
- What?

390
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:45,545
King Land's annual profit last year
was 100 billion won.

391
00:27:45,628 --> 00:27:48,381
Of course, Ko Won
earned the most among them!

392
00:27:49,382 --> 00:27:51,968
<i>His show had the highest ratings
even with his bad acting.</i>

393
00:27:52,052 --> 00:27:53,094
LIKES

394
00:27:53,178 --> 00:27:55,680
<i>All of his songs would top
the music charts.</i>

395
00:27:56,264 --> 00:27:59,934
<i>The channel he created out of boredom
had a million subscribers on launch.</i>

396
00:28:00,685 --> 00:28:04,272
<i>Before the incident, he had either shot
or signed up for 15 commercials!</i>

397
00:28:04,355 --> 00:28:07,067
BEST OF THE BEST
K-POP'S COMMERCIAL STAR, KO WON

398
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,151
A WIDE RANGE OF ADS

399
00:28:08,234 --> 00:28:10,070
<i>Of course, he wasted it all.</i>

400
00:28:10,779 --> 00:28:13,698
<i>"Is it a crime to have someone else
get me sleeping pills?"</i>

401
00:28:13,782 --> 00:28:16,701
<i>To put it bluntly,
he enlisted since he was guilty.</i>

402
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:20,705
<i>He fell during their comeback concert
and had a herniated disc.</i>

403
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:24,250
<i>Because of his back injury,
he was assigned to public service instead.</i>

404
00:28:24,334 --> 00:28:25,168
I need water.

405
00:28:26,586 --> 00:28:28,046
This is what's next.

406
00:28:29,631 --> 00:28:31,216
Yes, I understand.

407
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:37,597
<i>And because of that,
you have it easy here. I'm so jealous.</i>

408
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,224
<i>Nothing ever works out for me.</i>

409
00:28:39,933 --> 00:28:41,601
<i>But everything works out for you.</i>

410
00:28:44,062 --> 00:28:44,896
He's so cute!

411
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,994
Ma'am.

412
00:29:00,954 --> 00:29:02,580
I need to talk to you outside.

413
00:29:04,707 --> 00:29:06,501
Hey, I'm going out for a bit.

414
00:29:06,584 --> 00:29:07,585
What did you just…

415
00:29:09,587 --> 00:29:12,298
Make sure to keep your breaks
as short as you can.

416
00:29:12,382 --> 00:29:13,883
- Be back quickly.
- Okay.

417
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,196
- Hot?
- What?

418
00:29:36,156 --> 00:29:38,158
- Iced.
- You knew what I meant?

419
00:29:38,241 --> 00:29:40,368
Older folks usually like
hot coffee though.

420
00:29:41,453 --> 00:29:42,579
I always get iced coffee.

421
00:29:43,705 --> 00:29:44,539
Me too.

422
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:48,376
Why did you want to talk?

423
00:29:48,918 --> 00:29:50,211
You can tell me anything.

424
00:29:50,295 --> 00:29:52,464
I'll listen to whatever you have to say.

425
00:29:54,966 --> 00:29:57,343
I want to return
what you sent me yesterday.

426
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,473
I put everything in the car.

427
00:30:03,475 --> 00:30:04,476
Why?

428
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:05,768
You didn't like the gifts?

429
00:30:05,852 --> 00:30:08,104
They were too much
to just be called gifts.

430
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,732
Just take this then.

431
00:30:10,815 --> 00:30:13,985
This was the most excessive one!
Who gives a car as thanks?

432
00:30:16,029 --> 00:30:17,739
I'll just take this drink.

433
00:30:17,822 --> 00:30:19,949
I heard you ride your bike around.

434
00:30:20,033 --> 00:30:21,201
What's wrong with that?

435
00:30:21,618 --> 00:30:23,369
I ride it on purpose for my health.

436
00:30:24,704 --> 00:30:27,624
You could fall and break a bone
while riding around.

437
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,127
Look, thank you for being considerate,

438
00:30:31,211 --> 00:30:33,087
but I'll take care of my own health.

439
00:30:33,588 --> 00:30:35,798
- How about a scooter then?
- I said it's fine!

440
00:30:36,466 --> 00:30:37,759
I was thinking of you--

441
00:30:37,842 --> 00:30:40,845
If you need to do something for me
to make you feel better,

442
00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:44,349
then just buy me coffee from time to time.

443
00:30:44,432 --> 00:30:46,184
That would be more than enough.

444
00:30:46,267 --> 00:30:48,353
Then, I'll get you a coffee shop--

445
00:30:48,436 --> 00:30:49,604
For crying out loud!

446
00:30:51,314 --> 00:30:52,774
What about a coffee machine?

447
00:30:52,857 --> 00:30:54,025
- I'm leaving.
- Wait!

448
00:30:54,108 --> 00:30:55,944
Wait! Where are you going? Why?

449
00:30:56,027 --> 00:30:58,321
Where are you going? All right.

450
00:30:58,404 --> 00:31:01,866
No, wait. Okay, I got it.

451
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,952
Just take a seat for a moment.

452
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,750
Then, I'll get you an iced coffee
every morning. Deal?

453
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:12,126
Maybe not every morning--

454
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,920
- I'm going.
- Okay!

455
00:31:14,504 --> 00:31:15,463
Daily coffee. Deal.

456
00:31:16,548 --> 00:31:18,675
Daily coffee. Deal?

457
00:31:19,425 --> 00:31:20,385
Okay, deal.

458
00:31:23,346 --> 00:31:24,180
Daily coffee.

459
00:31:30,979 --> 00:31:34,482
Thanks to the huge crime you committed,
you'll be more famous than Ko Won.

460
00:31:47,662 --> 00:31:50,373
Ko Won's arrival
was announced that morning,

461
00:31:50,456 --> 00:31:53,334
but how did you know
and prepare in advance, Mr. Ji Dong-kwon?

462
00:31:54,085 --> 00:31:56,546
Did someone give you a tip
about his schedule?

463
00:31:56,629 --> 00:31:58,965
How dare he go around
with his head held high?

464
00:31:59,465 --> 00:32:00,758
Who does he think he is?

465
00:32:02,302 --> 00:32:03,511
You're not cooperating at all.

466
00:32:04,637 --> 00:32:05,638
Let's try again.

467
00:32:06,889 --> 00:32:09,601
Did Ko Won ever harass you,
Mr. Ji Dong-kwon?

468
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:14,772
I know everything.

469
00:32:15,356 --> 00:32:16,733
I know what he's thinking.

470
00:32:17,734 --> 00:32:18,735
What is he thinking?

471
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:24,824
He shamelessly smiles,
but he's terrified on the inside.

472
00:32:29,162 --> 00:32:32,832
At his autograph signing event,
I saw him curse at me.

473
00:32:35,877 --> 00:32:38,963
You mean last year
when you were indicted for hate comments?

474
00:32:39,047 --> 00:32:42,300
That's when that bastard cursed at me!

475
00:32:42,383 --> 00:32:45,303
Judging from the video,
you were at least 20 meters away from him.

476
00:32:45,386 --> 00:32:48,640
Your eyesight must be sharper
than an eagle's.

477
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:50,892
You're all on the same team.

478
00:32:52,143 --> 00:32:53,519
This is why I go mad.

479
00:32:54,812 --> 00:32:56,105
Because of all of you,

480
00:32:56,189 --> 00:32:57,940
I can't help but take drugs.

481
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,235
Bring them to me.

482
00:33:02,528 --> 00:33:04,322
My drugs!

483
00:33:04,405 --> 00:33:05,573
Bring me my drugs!

484
00:33:06,324 --> 00:33:09,243
Well, doing that
will only hurt your hands.

485
00:33:09,994 --> 00:33:11,788
Let's make it a tidy confession.

486
00:33:12,705 --> 00:33:14,582
You held a grudge against Ko Won,

487
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:17,794
who sued you for hate comments,
and with all those reporters there,

488
00:33:17,877 --> 00:33:19,462
you planned to get revenge, right?

489
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:22,298
Just a moment.

490
00:33:23,716 --> 00:33:24,759
<i>I love you all!</i>

491
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,886
Take a look at this.

492
00:33:29,347 --> 00:33:30,556
It's that bitch's fault.

493
00:33:31,933 --> 00:33:33,518
It's all because of her.

494
00:33:34,811 --> 00:33:37,689
That damn old lady ruined everything!

495
00:33:40,775 --> 00:33:43,403
Hey, you punk! Ji Dong-kwon! Settle down!

496
00:33:48,449 --> 00:33:49,534
I'll kill that bitch!

497
00:33:50,118 --> 00:33:53,579
I'm going to kill her! Let go!

498
00:33:58,126 --> 00:34:00,044
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

499
00:34:00,128 --> 00:34:03,506
They say the drugs he was on
are new ones popular at clubs.

500
00:34:03,589 --> 00:34:05,258
It's a modified drug patch.

501
00:34:06,217 --> 00:34:08,052
I bet they'll even make
topical drugs soon.

502
00:34:08,136 --> 00:34:10,596
I guess you and Ko Won
were destined to be linked.

503
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,014
You're entwined again.

504
00:34:12,473 --> 00:34:14,684
You met in court and reunited
at the prosecutors' office

505
00:34:14,767 --> 00:34:15,727
with him as the victim.

506
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:16,769
Destiny, my foot.

507
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,980
Don't use that word so carelessly.

508
00:34:19,689 --> 00:34:22,233
Didn't you say
Ji Dong-kwon lives in Seohan City?

509
00:34:22,316 --> 00:34:25,194
Yes, the report says Seoul,
but he lives in Seohan City.

510
00:34:25,278 --> 00:34:26,988
We found sulfuric acid at his house.

511
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,073
He moves to Seohan City,

512
00:34:29,157 --> 00:34:32,160
and the person who sued him
just happens to be assigned to Seohan?

513
00:34:33,453 --> 00:34:35,538
That kind of destiny rivals your own.

514
00:34:47,049 --> 00:34:48,134
You didn't drive?

515
00:34:48,217 --> 00:34:50,178
I was tired,
so I took some sleeping pills.

516
00:34:50,261 --> 00:34:52,430
- Just being safe.
- You should've summoned him then.

517
00:34:53,222 --> 00:34:55,141
Why come all the way
to the detention center?

518
00:34:56,184 --> 00:34:57,059
To ease nerves.

519
00:34:58,436 --> 00:34:59,437
Whose?

520
00:35:01,939 --> 00:35:02,815
Whose nerves?

521
00:35:02,899 --> 00:35:04,150
Get in the car.

522
00:35:04,734 --> 00:35:05,568
Who?

523
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:40,257
- Did you bring the document?
- Yes.

524
00:36:35,896 --> 00:36:37,272
"Hang in there. You got this."

525
00:36:37,898 --> 00:36:38,774
If you say that--

526
00:36:38,857 --> 00:36:40,567
How could I even comfort you?

527
00:36:40,651 --> 00:36:42,277
My life's hard too.

528
00:36:44,822 --> 00:36:46,824
I'm in no position to comfort anyone.

529
00:36:51,829 --> 00:36:53,080
They're vitamins.

530
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:58,127
You know too many vitamins
can make you sick too, right?

531
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,296
Don't overdo it.

532
00:37:44,715 --> 00:37:47,051
<i>You know too many vitamins
can make you sick too, right?</i>

533
00:37:49,261 --> 00:37:50,637
Don't overdo it.

534
00:38:22,127 --> 00:38:25,172
- You must've had some work to do outside.
- Yes.

535
00:38:29,384 --> 00:38:31,678
You weren't in your office this morning.

536
00:38:33,263 --> 00:38:34,264
No, I wasn't.

537
00:38:38,477 --> 00:38:39,937
Do you have something to say?

538
00:38:41,021 --> 00:38:42,648
I just wanted to thank you.

539
00:38:43,649 --> 00:38:44,650
For what?

540
00:39:05,963 --> 00:39:07,047
Here.

541
00:39:09,049 --> 00:39:10,467
It's my favorite flavor.

542
00:39:11,677 --> 00:39:12,928
I see. Thank you.

543
00:39:33,365 --> 00:39:34,241
That's so funny!

544
00:39:34,324 --> 00:39:35,576
<i>You're too kind.</i>

545
00:39:35,659 --> 00:39:37,035
<i>I'm not smart, so I know nothing.</i>

546
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,287
Goodness!

547
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:42,166
You didn't head home?

548
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:43,917
It's still office hours.

549
00:39:46,503 --> 00:39:49,423
Could you send this data
as files to the investigator?

550
00:39:50,424 --> 00:39:51,466
I'll do it tomorrow.

551
00:39:51,925 --> 00:39:53,802
Send it today for the report, okay?

552
00:39:53,886 --> 00:39:55,387
The work day's almost over.

553
00:39:59,266 --> 00:40:02,394
It needs to be handed over
to prosecute or do anything.

554
00:40:02,477 --> 00:40:04,271
But it's just so much work.

555
00:40:05,564 --> 00:40:07,816
You work four to five hours a day at best.

556
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,067
But that's too much?

557
00:40:09,151 --> 00:40:12,487
Then, you want me to sit at my desk
for eight hours without breaks?

558
00:40:14,698 --> 00:40:18,243
If you're not going to work
eight hours a day, why are you even here?

559
00:40:19,036 --> 00:40:20,454
Because I get paid.

560
00:40:20,537 --> 00:40:23,707
Right, so you work as much
as you're paid and do it properly.

561
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,375
- Isn't that normal?
- Exactly.

562
00:40:25,459 --> 00:40:27,753
I won't get paid more for working hard.

563
00:40:27,836 --> 00:40:30,505
There's no need
to work until exhaustion. Right?

564
00:40:32,299 --> 00:40:34,927
I see. So that's the type
of person you are.

565
00:40:35,761 --> 00:40:36,595
What's that mean?

566
00:40:36,678 --> 00:40:38,055
Ignorant.

567
00:40:38,138 --> 00:40:39,681
- Irresponsible.
- Excuse me?

568
00:40:39,765 --> 00:40:41,934
- Lacks common sense.
- What did you say?

569
00:40:42,017 --> 00:40:42,851
I'll correct that.

570
00:40:42,935 --> 00:40:44,144
Totally thoughtless.

571
00:40:49,316 --> 00:40:51,068
I won't do it!

572
00:40:52,277 --> 00:40:53,654
I'm going to kill him!

573
00:40:54,613 --> 00:40:55,989
That bastard!

574
00:40:56,073 --> 00:40:57,950
Excuse me? I'm sorry but--

575
00:40:58,033 --> 00:41:00,661
I'm so annoyed right now!
Don't talk to me!

576
00:41:07,292 --> 00:41:08,961
Excuse me? Are you okay?

577
00:41:09,044 --> 00:41:11,046
I said don't talk to me!

578
00:41:11,129 --> 00:41:12,798
I told you to stop talking to me!

579
00:41:17,427 --> 00:41:18,887
Hey, lady!

580
00:41:18,971 --> 00:41:20,722
There's no tissue paper. Damn it.

581
00:41:20,806 --> 00:41:22,683
That's why I was going to put it in.

582
00:41:22,766 --> 00:41:23,934
Are you mocking me?

583
00:41:24,601 --> 00:41:26,186
This is ridiculous.

584
00:41:26,937 --> 00:41:28,146
Tissues.

585
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,982
Do your job properly!

586
00:41:31,233 --> 00:41:33,318
<i>Wow, that crazy…</i>

587
00:41:33,402 --> 00:41:37,072
<i>You're lucky
you didn't run into me at night!</i>

588
00:41:41,618 --> 00:41:42,619
Crazy bastard.

589
00:41:43,287 --> 00:41:44,454
He thinks he's so important.

590
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,960
He's like a damn virus.

591
00:41:50,043 --> 00:41:51,211
So annoying!

592
00:41:51,837 --> 00:41:52,879
<i>You're crying…</i>

593
00:41:52,963 --> 00:41:54,339
I've been too upset.

594
00:41:54,423 --> 00:41:55,424
<i>"What about my makeup?"</i>

595
00:41:55,507 --> 00:41:56,591
<i>When you have a meltdown…</i>

596
00:41:56,675 --> 00:41:59,594
Does he think I can't get another job?

597
00:41:59,678 --> 00:42:01,847
Whatever! I'm a Do Ga-yeong fan!

598
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:05,392
<i>Nice and thinly. First, take the base…</i>

599
00:42:06,018 --> 00:42:08,103
- This is good.
- Good?

600
00:42:09,313 --> 00:42:11,982
To lose someone
when we're understaffed as it is?

601
00:42:12,482 --> 00:42:14,985
Process her resignation
and send another office assistant.

602
00:42:16,653 --> 00:42:17,738
Look here, Gye.

603
00:42:18,989 --> 00:42:21,241
Is it that hard to stay under the radar?

604
00:42:21,908 --> 00:42:22,743
Is it?

605
00:42:22,826 --> 00:42:25,829
Is it due to hard feelings with Ko Won
and having his acid case now?

606
00:42:26,788 --> 00:42:29,374
Why would there be
any hard feelings when it's work?

607
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:30,709
Even if there were, why--

608
00:42:30,792 --> 00:42:33,378
Are you trying to get even
because you were angered?

609
00:42:33,962 --> 00:42:35,297
Is that what you do, sir?

610
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:39,843
Do you involve personal feelings into work
to get revenge, get even, or retaliate?

611
00:42:39,926 --> 00:42:41,011
You little punk.

612
00:42:41,511 --> 00:42:42,554
You just insulted me.

613
00:42:45,349 --> 00:42:47,059
How could I possibly do that?

614
00:42:47,142 --> 00:42:48,518
So just talk to her--

615
00:42:48,602 --> 00:42:50,103
You can teach what they don't know.

616
00:42:50,187 --> 00:42:51,730
And time solves inexperience.

617
00:42:51,813 --> 00:42:53,565
But being ignorant can't be fixed.

618
00:42:53,648 --> 00:42:57,069
Anyway, this was my fault. I apologize.

619
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:01,698
I assume you took my request so I'll go.

620
00:43:01,782 --> 00:43:03,408
Wait. I'm not done yet!

621
00:43:03,492 --> 00:43:06,036
You kept repeating yourself,
so I thought you were.

622
00:43:08,121 --> 00:43:09,748
I'm really going now.

623
00:43:14,669 --> 00:43:16,213
Damn it!

624
00:43:16,296 --> 00:43:18,048
Kang's always been so selfish.

625
00:43:18,131 --> 00:43:20,342
I knew it when he gushed
with praise for Gye.

626
00:43:22,552 --> 00:43:24,429
We're low on staff. Who do I assign?

627
00:43:35,607 --> 00:43:37,484
<i>She saved someone's life.</i>

628
00:43:37,567 --> 00:43:40,320
- Doesn't she deserve another prize?
- Of course, we have plans for that.

629
00:43:40,404 --> 00:43:43,323
Yes, we're considering what it should be.

630
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:53,417
Damn, it's cold!

631
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,335
Hey, there's no dismembered corpse!

632
00:43:55,419 --> 00:43:57,295
Pull out!

633
00:43:58,171 --> 00:43:59,005
Let's pull out!

634
00:43:59,089 --> 00:44:00,424
Pull out! Pack it up!

635
00:44:00,507 --> 00:44:01,591
Get the equipment!

636
00:44:01,675 --> 00:44:02,676
Pull out!

637
00:44:03,301 --> 00:44:04,719
Let's go home.

638
00:44:11,309 --> 00:44:12,894
Did you find anything else?

639
00:44:13,645 --> 00:44:16,356
Not yet. Not sure
if that's a good thing or not.

640
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,524
What?

641
00:44:17,607 --> 00:44:18,442
The victim

642
00:44:19,025 --> 00:44:20,193
could still be alive.

643
00:44:21,403 --> 00:44:22,237
Wait.

644
00:44:23,738 --> 00:44:25,073
If she's still alive…

645
00:44:25,157 --> 00:44:27,742
The limb hasn't shown
discoloration or rigor mortis,

646
00:44:27,826 --> 00:44:30,036
so it was cut while she was still alive.

647
00:44:31,329 --> 00:44:33,415
Man, this guy's an absolute lunatic.

648
00:44:33,498 --> 00:44:34,708
It was a living person.

649
00:44:38,962 --> 00:44:40,005
But…

650
00:44:40,505 --> 00:44:42,382
why would he have been so cruel?

651
00:44:45,093 --> 00:44:46,178
Good question.

652
00:44:46,887 --> 00:44:49,181
I think there was a similar case before.

653
00:44:49,764 --> 00:44:52,225
In the files that I gave you,

654
00:44:52,309 --> 00:44:55,353
wasn't there a victim
who was dismembered while still alive?

655
00:45:05,322 --> 00:45:06,865
Is the autopsy report out yet?

656
00:45:06,948 --> 00:45:08,575
It'll be out next week.

657
00:45:08,658 --> 00:45:12,245
Also, about the silver SUV
you mentioned from that night…

658
00:45:12,329 --> 00:45:13,413
Yes, did you find it?

659
00:45:13,496 --> 00:45:16,124
We checked all traffic cameras
on roads leading out of town,

660
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:18,710
but from the night
of the accident to morning,

661
00:45:18,793 --> 00:45:22,214
there weren't any silver SUVs
that left during that time.

662
00:45:22,797 --> 00:45:26,509
This path is the only one here,
which means they went into town.

663
00:45:27,469 --> 00:45:28,595
By any chance,

664
00:45:28,678 --> 00:45:32,015
can you see if any of these cars
look familiar to you?

665
00:45:32,641 --> 00:45:34,559
I sent this by text to you too.

666
00:45:35,143 --> 00:45:37,979
Even if it's silver,
there are many different shades.

667
00:45:38,063 --> 00:45:40,440
Light and dark gray.
They're all different.

668
00:45:40,941 --> 00:45:43,443
I'd be grateful
if you could pick the most similar.

669
00:45:43,944 --> 00:45:45,278
- I'll check.
- Okay.

670
00:45:45,362 --> 00:45:46,321
Take care.

671
00:45:46,404 --> 00:45:47,656
Detective Kwon!

672
00:45:47,739 --> 00:45:48,782
- Come here!
- Coming!

673
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:07,634
DOCUMENTS

674
00:46:08,468 --> 00:46:11,263
<i>The person you are trying to call…</i>

675
00:46:11,846 --> 00:46:13,598
Why won't she unblock me?

676
00:47:35,013 --> 00:47:36,139
Six…

677
00:47:37,015 --> 00:47:38,391
Four, three, eight.

678
00:47:46,649 --> 00:47:47,734
Damn it!

679
00:48:01,331 --> 00:48:02,791
Six, four, three, eight.

680
00:48:18,932 --> 00:48:19,766
Mr. Gye.

681
00:48:23,228 --> 00:48:26,064
At this point, it seems
you're blocking me on purpose.

682
00:48:26,147 --> 00:48:27,273
Right, I forgot.

683
00:48:29,943 --> 00:48:30,944
I'm sorry.

684
00:48:31,027 --> 00:48:33,822
I've been so busy lately
that I forgot to unblock you.

685
00:48:34,823 --> 00:48:35,990
You called me.

686
00:48:36,533 --> 00:48:37,617
What brings you here?

687
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,369
Let's go somewhere and talk.

688
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:42,622
My goodness.

689
00:48:44,082 --> 00:48:44,916
Let's go out.

690
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,210
- Let's take the car.
- Okay.

691
00:48:48,503 --> 00:48:49,587
Goodness!

692
00:48:49,671 --> 00:48:51,464
It's late. Where are you going?

693
00:48:51,548 --> 00:48:53,091
Come in and talk. Come in.

694
00:48:53,174 --> 00:48:55,093
- No, it's fine.
- Nonsense.

695
00:48:55,176 --> 00:48:56,845
It's not fine with me.

696
00:48:56,928 --> 00:48:58,263
Come inside.

697
00:48:58,888 --> 00:49:00,765
- We're not strangers, are we?
- We are!

698
00:49:00,849 --> 00:49:02,225
Be quiet. Come on.

699
00:49:02,308 --> 00:49:04,936
Make yourself at home. Relax.

700
00:49:05,019 --> 00:49:06,896
- But I can't relax…
- I'll help you.

701
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,064
I don't think you can.

702
00:49:08,148 --> 00:49:10,984
- Ms. Lee?
- Dad, do something about Mom.

703
00:49:11,067 --> 00:49:13,111
- Me?
- No.

704
00:49:15,029 --> 00:49:16,030
Damn it.

705
00:49:28,543 --> 00:49:31,004
Take a seat. Sit down.

706
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:34,883
What are you doing?

707
00:49:35,592 --> 00:49:36,468
Honey?

708
00:49:38,928 --> 00:49:41,264
Hurry and sit. Sit down.

709
00:49:43,349 --> 00:49:44,559
Okay.

710
00:49:45,602 --> 00:49:47,479
- Open up.
- I can eat it.

711
00:49:47,562 --> 00:49:48,980
Come on now. Open up.

712
00:49:53,401 --> 00:49:54,360
Should we talk outside?

713
00:49:54,444 --> 00:49:56,070
- Yes.
- Okay.

714
00:49:56,154 --> 00:49:57,947
Why go outside? Go in and talk.

715
00:49:58,031 --> 00:50:00,492
- In where?
- Where do you think? Your room.

716
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,951
- My room?
- Yeah.

717
00:50:02,035 --> 00:50:02,911
Why would we?

718
00:50:03,703 --> 00:50:04,579
Here.

719
00:50:04,662 --> 00:50:06,581
- What's with you?
- Come on.

720
00:50:06,664 --> 00:50:08,124
It's important. Right?

721
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:09,501
Go inside and quietly talk.

722
00:50:09,584 --> 00:50:10,877
It's okay. Go inside.

723
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:11,920
It's only one question.

724
00:50:12,003 --> 00:50:13,922
- Honey, the fork.
- Right.

725
00:50:14,672 --> 00:50:16,007
It won't take long though.

726
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:18,510
Go inside. It's quiet.
Make yourself comfortable.

727
00:50:19,385 --> 00:50:20,678
Just relax.

728
00:50:20,762 --> 00:50:21,763
But I can't…

729
00:50:22,972 --> 00:50:24,349
Pretend we're not here.

730
00:50:25,016 --> 00:50:25,892
Mom, please…

731
00:50:28,228 --> 00:50:29,729
Jeez.

732
00:50:48,873 --> 00:50:49,707
This is…

733
00:50:50,208 --> 00:50:52,126
This is really good for dieting.

734
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:54,003
I can do arm workouts.

735
00:50:54,087 --> 00:50:56,673
I can work biceps and triceps
and do squats with it.

736
00:50:56,756 --> 00:50:59,759
Well, people who often fail go on diets.

737
00:51:02,345 --> 00:51:04,389
So what did you want to ask me?

738
00:51:05,139 --> 00:51:07,392
I can't hear a word they're saying.

739
00:51:11,938 --> 00:51:12,981
I know.

740
00:51:13,064 --> 00:51:14,524
The room's soundproofed well.

741
00:51:24,659 --> 00:51:26,411
He didn't come just to talk, right?

742
00:51:26,494 --> 00:51:28,288
- Then, what else?
- Come on.

743
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:32,083
A young man and woman
wouldn't talk with just their words.

744
00:51:37,755 --> 00:51:41,092
By any chance, are any of these
the silver SUV from that day?

745
00:51:45,305 --> 00:51:48,850
It was a light gray SUV.

746
00:51:48,933 --> 00:51:52,395
But it was dark and at night,
so I'm not sure.

747
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,158
Light gray.

748
00:52:06,451 --> 00:52:09,037
That would narrow it down to 20 cars.

749
00:52:16,669 --> 00:52:18,254
You have to check each one?

750
00:52:18,338 --> 00:52:19,714
They'll analyze the tracks.

751
00:52:19,797 --> 00:52:21,924
Identifying the tire model will help.

752
00:52:25,762 --> 00:52:28,222
What was that smell though?

753
00:52:28,306 --> 00:52:29,557
It was so unique.

754
00:52:30,725 --> 00:52:32,226
If I could just remember that,

755
00:52:33,102 --> 00:52:34,395
I think it would help.

756
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,201
Take care.

757
00:52:52,288 --> 00:52:53,122
Drive safely.

758
00:53:03,508 --> 00:53:04,926
Goodness!

759
00:53:09,263 --> 00:53:10,390
A prosecutor?

760
00:53:11,516 --> 00:53:15,103
Of all public servants,
did you snag the best? A prime cut?

761
00:53:15,687 --> 00:53:17,563
If he's a prime cut,
what am I? Frozen pork?

762
00:53:17,647 --> 00:53:19,232
Hardly. You're chopped liver.

763
00:53:19,315 --> 00:53:21,651
Thanks for hitting me
with that hard truth.

764
00:53:21,734 --> 00:53:22,694
It sure hurts.

765
00:53:22,777 --> 00:53:23,611
Jeez.

766
00:53:23,695 --> 00:53:24,696
Pork belly's fine.

767
00:53:24,779 --> 00:53:26,531
Chopped liver, too.

768
00:53:26,614 --> 00:53:28,408
You snagged the cream

769
00:53:28,491 --> 00:53:29,826
of the crop.

770
00:53:31,869 --> 00:53:34,205
At the tail end of your twenties,

771
00:53:34,288 --> 00:53:36,541
you've hit the jackpot.

772
00:53:36,624 --> 00:53:37,709
A prosecutor?

773
00:53:39,502 --> 00:53:40,878
A prosecutor!

774
00:53:40,962 --> 00:53:42,046
Come on in. Prosecutor.

775
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:43,005
Okay? Prosecutor.

776
00:53:43,089 --> 00:53:45,133
- A prosecutor's here!
- Dad.

777
00:53:45,216 --> 00:53:47,885
I don't know why
she's like that either, so don't ask.

778
00:53:47,969 --> 00:53:50,179
A prosecutor came to our house! How nice!

779
00:53:50,263 --> 00:53:51,889
This is so embarrassing.

780
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:53,725
I'm so embarrassed.

781
00:53:53,808 --> 00:53:56,686
All right, a prosecutor!

782
00:54:04,777 --> 00:54:05,820
Bye, Mom.

783
00:54:07,029 --> 00:54:08,906
Mi-jin. Wait, come here.

784
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:09,824
What is it?

785
00:54:09,907 --> 00:54:11,534
Here. Drink this before you go.

786
00:54:11,617 --> 00:54:13,202
- Mom, I have no time.
- Drink it!

787
00:54:15,747 --> 00:54:18,458
By the way,
how did you meet that prosecutor?

788
00:54:19,917 --> 00:54:22,837
Drink it! It's good for you.
Don't spit it out. Hurry.

789
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:27,258
- Good girl.
- I'm late.

790
00:54:27,341 --> 00:54:29,135
- I'll be back.
- Wait.

791
00:54:29,218 --> 00:54:30,470
Tell me how you met him.

792
00:54:30,553 --> 00:54:33,473
There's no reason for it
unless you got in trouble!

793
00:54:34,098 --> 00:54:35,433
That brat!

794
00:54:40,396 --> 00:54:41,439
That was close.

795
00:54:44,025 --> 00:54:45,401
Let me introduce myself.

796
00:54:45,485 --> 00:54:47,069
I'm Seo Mal-tae.

797
00:54:47,862 --> 00:54:48,946
He's a former detective.

798
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:51,491
When Detective Seo was on the scene,

799
00:54:51,574 --> 00:54:54,076
even the meanest punks
would be scared to death.

800
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,995
That's how great he was.

801
00:54:56,078 --> 00:54:58,372
I'm honored to work with you.

802
00:54:58,456 --> 00:54:59,457
Thank you.

803
00:55:04,504 --> 00:55:07,215
If you're curious
or have questions about anything,

804
00:55:07,298 --> 00:55:09,008
you can ask me.

805
00:55:09,091 --> 00:55:11,135
I'm the youngest one here.

806
00:55:11,219 --> 00:55:14,055
You are quite young
for a senior public intern.

807
00:55:14,138 --> 00:55:15,932
That's a great smile too.

808
00:55:16,808 --> 00:55:18,726
It wasn't that big,

809
00:55:19,268 --> 00:55:21,437
but I did have a business
with 30 employees.

810
00:55:21,521 --> 00:55:22,897
I'm sure you can tell,

811
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:27,860
but everyone here
was successful in their primes.

812
00:55:27,944 --> 00:55:30,154
Of course, the same goes for me as well.

813
00:55:30,238 --> 00:55:33,616
I promise to work hard
and not cause any inconvenience.

814
00:55:41,916 --> 00:55:42,917
Ms. Lim.

815
00:55:43,459 --> 00:55:45,628
- Yes?
- The deputy chief's looking for you.

816
00:55:45,711 --> 00:55:46,587
Why?

817
00:55:47,046 --> 00:55:48,214
Did you do something wrong?

818
00:55:48,297 --> 00:55:50,132
No, not that I can think of.

819
00:55:50,842 --> 00:55:52,343
- Can you take this?
- Yeah, go on.

820
00:55:52,426 --> 00:55:53,511
Okay.

821
00:55:54,846 --> 00:55:56,681
She shouldn't have meddled so much.

822
00:56:13,239 --> 00:56:14,991
Mr. Gye!

823
00:56:16,742 --> 00:56:17,743
Yes?

824
00:56:21,539 --> 00:56:24,083
I'll work really hard.

825
00:56:26,377 --> 00:56:27,211
Okay.

826
00:56:28,004 --> 00:56:30,381
I promise I'll do my best.

827
00:56:32,758 --> 00:56:34,218
Okay, sure. Keep it up.

828
00:56:34,969 --> 00:56:36,429
You were…

829
00:56:37,638 --> 00:56:38,890
so considerate to me.

830
00:56:40,016 --> 00:56:41,183
Thank you so much.

831
00:56:46,188 --> 00:56:48,524
I'll take care of your office from now on.

832
00:56:49,567 --> 00:56:50,401
What?

833
00:57:04,081 --> 00:57:05,082
Hello.

834
00:57:09,462 --> 00:57:11,047
Where did you get the candy?

835
00:57:12,173 --> 00:57:13,507
I got them on my way here.

836
00:57:13,591 --> 00:57:14,926
You hate sweets.

837
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:18,054
That's interesting.

838
00:57:18,137 --> 00:57:20,765
I've seen a lot of people
tell you to shove it,

839
00:57:21,307 --> 00:57:22,892
but none of them ever gave you candy.

840
00:57:32,068 --> 00:57:34,445
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

841
00:57:56,884 --> 00:57:59,512
You've cleaned the office so well lately.

842
00:57:59,595 --> 00:58:00,763
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

843
00:58:00,846 --> 00:58:02,098
You work so hard.

844
00:58:05,059 --> 00:58:06,143
Have a nice day.

845
00:58:18,906 --> 00:58:21,158
Pink looks so good on you.

846
00:58:21,826 --> 00:58:23,286
They're new clothes I bought.

847
00:58:23,369 --> 00:58:24,704
I see.

848
00:58:24,787 --> 00:58:26,497
I see you're going somewhere nice.

849
00:58:27,206 --> 00:58:28,249
Well, yes.

850
00:58:31,961 --> 00:58:33,087
Take care.

851
00:59:13,711 --> 00:59:15,212
You haven't started cleaning yet?

852
00:59:15,838 --> 00:59:16,964
She said she's here to work.

853
00:59:17,548 --> 00:59:19,884
I see. Let's skip cleaning today.

854
00:59:19,967 --> 00:59:20,968
We're a bit busy.

855
00:59:21,802 --> 00:59:23,554
Well, the thing is…

856
00:59:24,347 --> 00:59:25,931
The new office assistant…

857
00:59:26,015 --> 00:59:27,933
- Wait, what was it?
- Office aide.

858
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:30,895
Yeah, that's her.

859
00:59:31,479 --> 00:59:32,480
What?

860
00:59:35,983 --> 00:59:38,152
As of today, I'll be here to help you.

861
00:59:38,235 --> 00:59:39,945
I'm your new office aide, Lim Sun.

862
00:59:41,697 --> 00:59:43,199
Office aide?

863
00:59:43,282 --> 00:59:44,742
Did that position exist?

864
00:59:48,204 --> 00:59:49,372
To be more precise…

865
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:51,791
An office clerk.

866
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:54,502
Why did you assign me an office clerk?

867
00:59:54,585 --> 00:59:55,419
Why?

868
00:59:55,503 --> 00:59:57,338
Your office assistant quit.

869
00:59:57,421 --> 00:59:58,297
We're understaffed.

870
00:59:58,381 --> 01:00:00,591
But our intern with abundant experience,

871
01:00:00,674 --> 01:00:03,427
a strong will,
and overflowing enthusiasm is…

872
01:00:03,511 --> 01:00:05,179
- An old lady.
- Yes, that lady--

873
01:00:05,262 --> 01:00:06,722
No! Don't say that!

874
01:00:06,806 --> 01:00:10,184
Ms. Lim is the perfect fit.

875
01:00:10,267 --> 01:00:11,268
Why is this so slow?

876
01:00:12,937 --> 01:00:14,230
Please put this off.

877
01:00:14,313 --> 01:00:15,272
Put it off?

878
01:00:15,356 --> 01:00:18,359
You think you can go back and forth
on personnel appointments

879
01:00:18,442 --> 01:00:20,152
however you feel like it?

880
01:00:20,945 --> 01:00:23,572
Open your own practice
if you want to pick employees.

881
01:00:24,198 --> 01:00:25,950
A civil servant
can't be biased about staff.

882
01:00:26,033 --> 01:00:28,369
Still, how could you hire an old lady?

883
01:00:28,452 --> 01:00:29,412
She's not an old lady!

884
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:31,831
Sir…

885
01:00:58,858 --> 01:01:01,235
I'll do my best to support you.

886
01:01:59,376 --> 01:02:02,296
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

887
01:02:02,963 --> 01:02:04,673
<i>You're really a civil servant?</i>

888
01:02:04,757 --> 01:02:06,842
No, not yet.

889
01:02:06,926 --> 01:02:10,095
Since it's come to this,
the best is to have her quit on her own.

890
01:02:10,179 --> 01:02:12,223
<i>Organize these into documents before noon.</i>

891
01:02:12,306 --> 01:02:14,225
A lot of chocolate chips.

892
01:02:14,308 --> 01:02:15,851
<i>Don't forget it</i>

893
01:02:16,519 --> 01:02:17,603
No way!

894
01:02:18,562 --> 01:02:20,022
