1
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:45,962
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

2
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,888
Hold on.

3
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:08,777
Be careful.

4
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,573
You don't have to do all this.

5
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,743
From what I've seen,
this is what couples seem to do.

6
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:18,453
Couples?

7
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:20,872
What?

8
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,875
Are you going to pretend
that kiss didn't happen?

9
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,418
We kissed twice too.

10
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,920
Quiet!

11
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,339
Be quiet. My parents are going to hear.

12
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,132
- It has to be a secret?
- Of course.

13
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,133
Until when?

14
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:33,968
Well...

15
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,098
Until I return to my normal self.

16
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:43,186
Well... when things get better.

17
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,278
Is it because you're worried
about how things are now?

18
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,741
Yes, and for other reasons too.

19
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,704
Remember before when you asked me
to keep my promise?

20
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:03,873
I'll keep that promise.

21
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,876
I'll protect you no matter what.

22
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,297
So put a little more trust in me,
even if you're worried.

23
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,135
Okay.

24
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,777
I'm home.

25
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,198
What? What was the reason today?

26
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,033
- What?
- I heard the car pull up.

27
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,327
- Didn't you come with Mr. Gye?
- You heard that?

28
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,121
Of course. I have perfect hearing.

29
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,247
Well...

30
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,916
He just gave me a ride.

31
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,752
What is he, a chauffeur?
That's all he did?

32
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,129
- Yeah.
- And nothing else?

33
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,839
What else could there be?

34
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,133
Dad.

35
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,050
Yeah?

36
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:57,927
Where have you been?

37
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,679
I was out getting some doenjang.

38
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,723
When did you go out?

39
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,558
Well...

40
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:06,394
You came in Mr. Gye's car,

41
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:09,022
he opened the door for you,
you got out, and...

42
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,024
Couples?

43
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,483
What?

44
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,694
Are you going to pretend
that kiss didn't happen?

45
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,238
We kissed twice too.

46
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,616
Be quiet. My parents are going to hear.

47
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,492
I'll protect you no matter what.

48
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,494
So put a little more trust in me.

49
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,955
- Then, you two--
- Dad!

50
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,458
It's cold outside.

51
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,461
Why would you go out to get doenjang?

52
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,838
You don't need any soy sauce or gochujang?

53
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,966
From now on, I'll go out
and get them for you,

54
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:40,428
so don't roam around alone at night,
eavesdropping on people.

55
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:43,306
And don't reveal what you heard. Got it?

56
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,268
Seriously, Dad.
Something awful could happen.

57
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,438
- Okay?
- Yeah.

58
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,148
Be careful not to catch a cold.

59
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:05,036
DO NOT OPEN
OPEN IT DURING THE DAY AND I'LL RUN AWAY

60
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,207
I'll keep that promise.

61
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,875
I'll protect you no matter what.

62
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,754
So put a little more trust in me,
even if you're worried.

63
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,182
There's something going on.

64
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,817
Chills run down my spine.

65
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,070
Her stare pierces right through me.

66
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,740
There's no need to be worried already.

67
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,285
The hand is quicker than the eye.

68
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,996
Does it need more doenjang?
It's a bit bland.

69
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:52,959
Freeze.

70
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,045
Come on. Out with it.

71
00:04:58,965 --> 00:04:59,882
Now!

72
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,552
You still won't talk?

73
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,394
What do I do?

74
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,272
- Still?
- Dad, I'm sorry.

75
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,404
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

76
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,537
Did you enjoy your lunch?

77
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,835
Yes. What about you?

78
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,045
Hearts, pew pew!

79
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,133
Gosh.

80
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:45,470
It would've been much better
if we had lunch together.

81
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,763
My goodness.

82
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,223
You should've called.
I would've come running.

83
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,442
It can happen.

84
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,944
I get it. If work becomes too hard,

85
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,446
people can lose their minds.

86
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,452
But why am I the only one who's working?

87
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:18,544
What happened with the NIMS review
from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety?

88
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,005
It was done ages ago.
I put it on your desk.

89
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,011
And the records
of Hwadong's fentanyl usage?

90
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,221
Why are you asking me?

91
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,056
Wasn't Ms. Lim
supposed to prepare that?

92
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,724
- That's right!
-"That's right"?

93
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,935
I'll get it ready quick
and send it to you.

94
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,438
No, you can take your time.

95
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,194
Did something good happen today?

96
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,488
No. What about you?

97
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,908
No, well... It's nothing.

98
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,827
The weather's so nice today.

99
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,036
Isn't it nice?

100
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,209
I'm glad I brought an umbrella.

101
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,245
Why do you keep avoiding me?

102
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:37,290
Who, me? I've just been so busy.
That's all.

103
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,667
Is it because I said I liked you?

104
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:40,585
Hey.

105
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,130
- Let's talk outside.
- Why? Wait, I...

106
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,256
No, wait.

107
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,258
What I said that night...

108
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,095
Gosh. What?

109
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:55,391
It seems you didn't understand
since I wasn't straightforward that night.

110
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,811
To be honest,
there's someone else I like.

111
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:00,813
I know.

112
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,231
You do?

113
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,568
It doesn't matter.

114
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,070
Well, okay.

115
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,031
So you're moving on, right?

116
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,284
Why would a star like you
be interested in someone like me?

117
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,619
I have no intentions of that.

118
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,621
Then, what will you do?

119
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,623
What? I'm not asking you for anything.

120
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,874
But...

121
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,251
It makes me uncomfortable.

122
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:26,923
It makes me really uncomfortable
whenever I bump into you like this.

123
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,549
- That's good.
- What?

124
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,176
That's exactly what I wanted.

125
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,929
I didn't tell you
to have you like me back.

126
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,057
I wanted you to know how I felt.

127
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:39,101
That way, you'll continue
to be uncomfortable just like now.

128
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,939
You'd at least become attracted.

129
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,065
Hey!

130
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:44,982
What?

131
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,862
Did you just laugh?

132
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:51,572
What's with you?

133
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,866
You're so cute.

134
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,243
Seriously?

135
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,245
There's no use talking to you.

136
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,122
I'm not joking.

137
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,793
So stop avoiding me.

138
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,508
And my feelings.

139
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,434
It looks like it'll be
another all-nighter.

140
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,270
Let's eat something good. I'll buy.

141
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,523
Did something good happen?

142
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,649
Not really.

143
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,282
Then, why have you been smiling all day?

144
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,866
No, I haven't.

145
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,830
Did you take any drugs by mistake
while investigating?

146
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,917
Goodness.

147
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,836
Should I eat alone?

148
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,547
He didn't really take anything, did he?

149
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,426
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

150
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,562
Why aren't you eating?
I ordered the special for you.

151
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:10,067
You don't like this kind of food,
especially gukbap.

152
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,739
I realized that when it comes to food,

153
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:18,576
who you eat it with and how you eat it
are more important than taste.

154
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,373
So you're saying
ox knee soup is food for the soul?

155
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:26,917
Since when?

156
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:31,797
You're laughing again.

157
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,051
What's gotten into you?
Can you please tell me?

158
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:38,137
I have so many documents to review.

159
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,805
I might not be able to stop by.

160
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,892
Aren't you pushing yourself too hard?

161
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,479
We're sitting together,
but why do I feel so lonely?

162
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,773
I'm having ox knee soup, so I'm fine.

163
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,987
MESSAGES: IF YOU REORDER TODAY...
LOG IN NOW TO CLAIM YOUR ITEM

164
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,325
Make sure to eat dinner.

165
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,785
I'll call you later.

166
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,455
Ox knee soup won't be enough.
He should have boiled beef too.

167
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,832
I want to hear his voice.

168
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:07,958
Where's my phone?

169
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,670
Where is it?

170
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,302
Wait.

171
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,560
Wait, when did I last see my phone?

172
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,437
Wait. Think.

173
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,942
I last saw it at the prosecutors' office.

174
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,723
Isn't that Ms. Lim's phone?

175
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,480
Should I pick up?

176
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,942
- Hello?
- Hey, Mi-jin. Are you asleep?

177
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:18,487
- Hello?
- Isn't this Mi-jin's phone?

178
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,073
This is Lim Sun's phone.

179
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,450
I'm sorry.

180
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,329
- What was that?
- What is it?

181
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:30,040
This is Ms. Lim's phone,
but they asked for Mi-jin.

182
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,334
That's weird. I should call her.

183
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,627
No way...

184
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,050
COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO

185
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,180
What's going on?

186
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:45,681
Wait.

187
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,767
No way.

188
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,269
Mi-jin is Lim Sun?

189
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:52,396
No!

190
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,948
I hope they're still eating.

191
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,331
Wait.

192
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,374
Go in first. I'll get some coffee.

193
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,709
Just drink some instant coffee.

194
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,544
I need more caffeine to work all night.

195
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,171
Dessert's on me.

196
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,756
Don't buy anything weird.

197
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,224
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

198
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:08,722
The number you've dialed is unavailable.
Please, leave your--

199
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,349
Jeez, that was close.

200
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,608
I just finished dinner and came back.
What are you up to?

201
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,064
Yes, Mr. Ju?

202
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:03,110
Ms. Lim is the one
who likes iced coffee. I like mine hot.

203
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,446
I want hot coffee, please.

204
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,032
How do you still not know what I like?

205
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:08,949
Okay, bye.

206
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,062
Mi-jin?

207
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,405
What brings you here?

208
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,200
I came here to see you.

209
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,117
What?

210
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,915
Did you really come to see me?

211
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,208
Yes.

212
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,211
You came all this way to see me?

213
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,631
Since you're here, do you want a tour?

214
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,717
- Follow me.
- Okay.

215
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,974
If you called,
we could've had dinner together.

216
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,725
I ate with Mr. Ju for no reason.

217
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,020
That's why I didn't call.

218
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,272
I didn't want you to eat late
because of me.

219
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,232
You did well.

220
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,775
That doesn't matter to me.

221
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,361
What if we'd missed each other?

222
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,280
Yeah, what if we had?

223
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,116
- This is it.
- Okay.

224
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,453
OFFICE ASSISTANT LIM SUN

225
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,040
That's my desk.

226
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,376
And this desk belongs to Ga-yeong's aunt.

227
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,378
I see.

228
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,296
Nothing special, right?

229
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,349
I'll do my best to support you.

230
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,563
Can I sit here?

231
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,314
- This seat?
- Yes.

232
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,274
Of course.

233
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,276
Wait a second.

234
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,446
- Why is the chair out here?
- Thank you.

235
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,947
Thank you.

236
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,258
Wow.

237
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:34,678
Do you like it?

238
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,305
Isn't the keyboard and mouse so cute?

239
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,431
- These?
- Yeah.

240
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,058
These paw prints are so cute.

241
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,227
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.

242
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,731
- Ms. Lee Mi-jin?
- Hello.

243
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:46,857
Hello. Wait.

244
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,026
What brings you to Mr. Gye's office?

245
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,195
She was just passing by.

246
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,196
Yes, that's right.

247
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,530
Don't tell me.

248
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,409
Are you here for this?

249
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,413
- Yes.
- Wow, you have great luck!

250
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,624
It's only possible to order this at night.

251
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,751
The wait is crazy during the day.

252
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,628
But didn't you go to buy coffee?

253
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,297
You know he only drinks coffee
so he can eat cake.

254
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,215
Yeah.

255
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,717
What?

256
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,052
How did you know that?

257
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,141
Because that's how I am.

258
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:24,103
Isn't everyone like that?
Drink coffee to eat cake?

259
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,729
Yes, that's right.

260
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,856
- It's like how we enjoy pig's trotters.
- Yeah.

261
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,944
There aren't any forks. I'll go get some.

262
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,112
Forks?

263
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:34,613
They're over...

264
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,369
Should we eat it at the table?

265
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,505
That was so natural of me, wasn't it?

266
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,550
People might think you work here.

267
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,592
They might.

268
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,932
Why didn't you buy one more?
You're so clueless.

269
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,642
Just give her yours.

270
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,313
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

271
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,149
You should manage your blood sugar.

272
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,733
You eat sweets without exercising,

273
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,903
so you have thin limbs and a gut,
making you look like E.T.

274
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,656
You need to be careful
of inheriting diabetes.

275
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,784
If you must, then have the carrot cake.

276
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,953
You're right.

277
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:26,248
My late father suffered
so much from diabetes.

278
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,167
- I know.
- How did you know that?

279
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,548
What is this familiar
but unfamiliar feeling?

280
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,800
Because of the pig's trotters?

281
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,135
The spicy pig's trotters.

282
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,137
- I knew it.
- Yeah.

283
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,555
You keep bringing that up.

284
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,432
- You can't join our club.
- Nope.

285
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:44,892
Let's not share.

286
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,143
- Only for us two?
- Yes.

287
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,230
That's my coffee.

288
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,781
It's so cool to be here like this.

289
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,743
I've always wanted to come here.

290
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,494
As my real self.

291
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,793
I'll wait

292
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,670
until you're ready.

293
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,968
I'm really curious about what you do
for work and what you can't tell me.

294
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,304
But I'll wait until you can say.

295
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,768
It could disappoint you though.

296
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:31,563
You have reasons and circumstances
you can't reveal. I understand.

297
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,567
Because you're the only person
I fully trust.

298
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,715
The difference
between the amount of fentanyl

299
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:01,218
Hwadong reported as prescribed
and their supply is too large.

300
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,308
All right.

301
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,476
Snap out of it.

302
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,477
- Right.
- Okay.

303
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:16,024
If you look at the records
of periodic loss or arbitrary disposal

304
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,484
from the year 2000 and onwards,

305
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,820
much more was disposed of than prescribed.

306
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,531
And Hwadong's supply
is excessive in comparison to its size.

307
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:26,201
Don't you think
this could be a false report?

308
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,705
If he'd been stealing like this,

309
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,207
that means he'd have
a huge stash of fentanyl.

310
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:39,756
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

311
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,844
Do you admit to the charges?

312
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,971
Do you have anything to say as a doctor?

313
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,767
Please give us a few words!

314
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,571
You worked hard
to go through decades worth of data.

315
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,783
I thought we'd need this much
to get you to talk.

316
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:09,661
I'm just an honorary director
with no real authority.

317
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,039
I gave up the actual management
of the hospital long ago.

318
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,166
The drugs from your hospital's basement

319
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,127
were identical to the ones
that were distributed in clubs.

320
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,795
So you're not involved in this either?

321
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:21,256
Even though a kidnapping
also took place there?

322
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,178
What did you do
with all that stolen fentanyl?

323
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:31,058
For charges of medical malpractice,
illegal drug distribution,

324
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:34,436
kidnapping, confinement, and assault,
jail time is certain.

325
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:37,731
You'll get at least ten years
for selling mass quantities of drugs.

326
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:41,943
Cooperate and you'll only be charged
for supplying and not distributing.

327
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,653
I'll get you a reduced sentence.

328
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,573
Instead of getting additional punishment
by being linked with the club,

329
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:48,116
five or six years will be taken off.

330
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,826
I have no concern

331
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,037
about the rest of my life.

332
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,882
May I see Lim Sun once more?

333
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,935
Mr. Gye, is this the right thing to do?

334
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:18,647
Whether it's right or wrong,
this is the best way to have Baek talk.

335
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:34,079
Not too long ago, I heard Lee Mi-jin
requested a visit to see me.

336
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,665
I thought you'd believe me
if you saw for yourself.

337
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:40,710
Let's say I believed your absurd nonsense.

338
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,633
How will you catch the culprit?

339
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:49,636
I smelled something.

340
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:50,846
A smell?

341
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,654
It could be a clue
if you knew what that smell was.

342
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,073
But if you can't figure it out?

343
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:12,909
I'll make them come to me.

344
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:17,080
Even if I have to reveal
that I'm a witness,

345
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:19,791
I will catch them.

346
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:25,881
LIST OF FENTANYL TRANSACTIONS IN SEOHAN

347
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:29,718
So this is a list of all the fentanyl
that has been distributed in Seohan?

348
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,261
Wow.

349
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,513
All the drug addicts on one list.

350
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:37,517
They're records that date back
to the incident 24 years ago.

351
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:41,021
How much would all the drugs here
amount to? Seriously?

352
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:44,357
But Baek Cheol-gyu
just readily handed this over to you?

353
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:46,860
I risked my life for it.

354
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:48,904
What?

355
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,573
I'm just saying.

356
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:58,038
What kind of relationship
do you have with Baek Cheol-gyu?

357
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,248
We just worked together.

358
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,710
No.

359
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,463
I had forgotten,

360
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:10,383
but someone I'd looked up to in the past

361
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:11,760
was the director.

362
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,599
Mi-jin, keep looking ahead.

363
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,975
Look forward.

364
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,979
Mi-jin, keep your eyes ahead.
Look in front of you.

365
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,981
Aunt Sun, don't let go!

366
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:27,234
Okay, look forward.

367
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,402
There you go.

368
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,533
My goodness!

369
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:40,789
My goodness!
Let's get you to the hospital!

370
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,166
Gosh.

371
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,711
All right. There we go.

372
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,214
It's okay. Goodness.

373
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,341
Goodness gracious.

374
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:54,427
You come so often.
Didn't you recently hurt your leg too?

375
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:57,013
- Thank you, Director Baek.
- You're welcome.

376
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,641
There we go. It's okay.

377
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,643
There. All done.

378
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,854
But is she really your aunt?

379
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:05,855
Yes.

380
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:08,650
You look just like your aunt.

381
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,070
Here.

382
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,281
If she was your mom, we'd believe it.

383
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,786
Great job.

384
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:29,754
A club in Seohan has been secretly selling
drugs and patches that contained

385
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,673
the narcotic pain reliever, fentanyl.

386
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,843
After a club employee responsible
for transporting the drugs

387
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,678
was arrested by the prosecution,

388
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,096
the club attempted

389
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,849
to bury the drugs in the mountains
to get rid of the evidence.

390
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,767
A crucial role in this investigation

391
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:46,271
was served by the testimony
of hospital director, Baek.

392
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,606
Baek had been stealing fentanyl

393
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:51,651
from his hospital
and supplying them as drugs.

394
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:55,447
As Baek had provided free medical care
to the elderly and low-income groups

395
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,490
in Seohan and had worked
as a senior public intern

396
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:00,243
for the prosecutors' office,
his arrest has shocked the public.

397
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,329
Hey!

398
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,998
This is why I told you
not to let outsiders in!

399
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,792
What are you going to do about this mess?

400
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:09,336
I...

401
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,712
SEOHAN DRUG DISTRIBUTOR ARRESTED

402
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:16,551
Still, we were able to seize
35 kilograms of drugs thanks to them.

403
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:17,761
You little...

404
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,222
And to be precise,

405
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,516
Baek Cheol-gyu was selected by the mayor.

406
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:27,145
The interns we chose are making
big contributions on the front lines.

407
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,521
Good for you, you punk!

408
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,873
- Hi, Detective Min.
- Hello, sir.

409
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:49,125
- What?
- It's about the kid you asked about.

410
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,044
- The missing person's son.
- Yeah.

411
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,545
His name's Gye Ji-ung.

412
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,257
- Hello? Sir?
- Yeah.

413
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:59,260
Yeah, okay. Well, thanks.

414
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,888
Take care of yourself. I'll call you.

415
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,098
Thanks. Bye.

416
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:13,483
Excuse me, Mr. Gye! Wait a minute.

417
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:15,944
Yes?

418
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,363
I have something to tell you.

419
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,156
To me?

420
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,577
Baek Cheol-gyu has Parkinson's?

421
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:29,624
My detective's hunch sensed
something suspicious about him.

422
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,334
I took a closer look into him.

423
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,465
Goodness.

424
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:48,351
Thank you.

425
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,895
Are you left-handed?

426
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:53,857
Yes.

427
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,697
I'm sure of it.

428
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,407
It's Parkinson's.

429
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,617
Just a moment.

430
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,291
Hello, Mr. Ju?

431
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:14,335
Get me Baek Cheol-gyu's
medical records as soon as possible.

432
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:19,966
He grew up well.

433
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,138
Mr. Gye.

434
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,891
Baek Cheol-gyu does have Parkinson's.

435
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:30,810
Also, if you look at the date,

436
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,354
he was receiving treatment
at the time Ko Na-heun was killed.

437
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:34,814
At Hwadong Medical Center?

438
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:38,151
No, the people there
had no idea he had Parkinson's.

439
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:40,945
He always received treatment
at a different hospital.

440
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:51,623
I'm just an honorary director
with no real authority.

441
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,958
I gave up actual management
of the hospital long ago.

442
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,378
Is that why he retired early?

443
00:29:57,378 --> 00:30:00,715
I checked the security footage
of the hospital he was admitted to.

444
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:04,010
I'd say his alibi checks out.

445
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:15,605
What do you mean
Baek Cheol-gyu's not the killer now?

446
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,608
It'd be impossible for him
to kill and dismember a person.

447
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,568
- He has Parkinson's.
- Parkinson's?

448
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:24,697
He entered a different hospital
to avoid the people at Hwadong.

449
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,241
And even if he sneaked out,

450
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:29,285
he wouldn't have been able to
get to the reservoir and back in an hour.

451
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:45,760
Hey.

452
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,931
You went off and demanded
Baek's arrest warrant just the other day!

453
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,851
But now, what?
He may not be the culprit?

454
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,018
Are you kidding me?

455
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,480
The chances of an accomplice?

456
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:01,860
We're investigating further
with the drug list he gave us.

457
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,237
There's no time. You can't do this alone!

458
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,783
Gosh, you're so brave.

459
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,619
How about sharing
Ko Na-heun's murder case?

460
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:12,787
Mr. Cha's approved.

461
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:17,166
- I think the real culprit's out there too.
- For what reason?

462
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,460
Baek's alibi is solid,
and there's no hard proof.

463
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,587
And he has no motive.

464
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:21,504
Motive?

465
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:25,174
If Baek was the culprit,
he would've had a motive to kill his wife

466
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:26,843
but none to kill Ko Na-heun.

467
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,094
That's it? Your reason?

468
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:30,722
You might not know,
but upper-class people like me

469
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,391
don't do irrational things
without solid reasons.

470
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,145
Damn it.

471
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,146
What's going on?

472
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:39,939
It's obvious.

473
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:41,649
- They're flirting.
- Flirting?

474
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:44,152
Ms. Tak has a crush on Mr. Gye.

475
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:45,737
She has a crush?

476
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:47,697
You didn't know?

477
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,657
It seemed like she hated him.

478
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,159
No, that was all fake.

479
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,952
It's been well-known for a while.

480
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:55,580
She liked him since college,
got rejected by him,

481
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,374
tried to get revenge, fell for him again,
and put a curse on him.

482
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:00,877
She went crazy
and made a scene all by herself.

483
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,588
But why are they suddenly flirting?

484
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,298
You said it's over between them.

485
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,257
Okay, Ms. Lim.

486
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:10,470
If there's even a tiny spark left
between a man and a woman,

487
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,806
it will burn with passion
as soon as it ignites.

488
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,142
Watch.

489
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:36,329
But why did you mark
these people separately?

490
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,290
Those are the notable transactions.

491
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,542
They avoided
peak drug season like real users.

492
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,461
They bought when prices
were at their lowest.

493
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,380
I see. Then...

494
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:47,423
What about this?

495
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:50,468
It's a list focusing on
only fentanyl transactions.

496
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,721
Then, I can focus my efforts on this.

497
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:03,773
Aren't you going home, Ms. Lim?

498
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,818
Well, I do have to go,

499
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,945
but I'll take my time today.

500
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,029
Really? Great.

501
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,281
Then, let's get some dinner together.

502
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:14,033
- I'll eat alone.
- Why eat alone?

503
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,456
You should eat together.

504
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,625
You three will eat together, right?

505
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,253
I don't know. I'm not hungry now.

506
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,754
Me neither.

507
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:30,216
If we get hungry later,
I know a great tent bar.

508
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,884
- We can--
- Are you kidding?

509
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,138
We all work to survive, right?

510
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:38,016
But your thoughtless actions
affect Mr. Ju!

511
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,852
He'll be by himself, all alone,
lonely, and forlorn.

512
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,187
Must you make him eat alone? For what?

513
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,356
- Excuse me?
- No, I'm fine.

514
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,066
- Be honest!
- Let's eat together.

515
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,526
See?

516
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,739
Then, let's just order something.

517
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,162
Hello, this is Room 307.

518
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,539
One jajangmyeon and one jjamppong, please.

519
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:02,707
And fried rice?

520
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,750
Japtang rice.

521
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,753
One japtang-like fried rice.

522
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:08,880
You don't have it?

523
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,548
Then, whatever japtang rice you have.

524
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,425
- Ms. Lim, pickled radish too.
- Okay.

525
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,885
We'd like a lot of pickled radish.

526
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:19,932
You're the only one
who thinks of me, Ms. Lim.

527
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,233
What's that lady's deal?

528
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,686
Are you still working?

529
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,153
I think I'll have to pull an all-nighter.

530
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:15,738
What?

531
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,450
An all-nighter?

532
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:22,453
Jeez, I can't even reveal it!

533
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,956
And I was the one
who wanted to keep it a secret.

534
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,252
That means he'll be with her.

535
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,978
This is a special case, isn't it?

536
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:50,648
You know it is. Why are you asking?

537
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,068
To be honest,

538
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,320
that's why I wanted in.

539
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,364
I wanted to do it together.

540
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,118
Are you still at it?
I made myself pretty clear--

541
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,202
Honestly,

542
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,079
I had my hopes up a bit at first.

543
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:08,291
I thought, "Did he come here for me?"

544
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,752
Don't laugh like that. It's annoying.

545
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,594
I'm going to quit after this case.

546
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:25,183
Once this case is solved,
do you want to go to Seoul with me?

547
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,981
COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO

548
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:40,990
Hello?

549
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,325
I'll be arriving soon.

550
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,284
Can you come out?

551
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,120
Weren't you working all night?
You're already done?

552
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,581
I called it a night just for you.

553
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,417
I'm kind of tired though.

554
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,585
Really?

555
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,921
Then, don't come out.
I can see you next time.

556
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,548
I mean, I am tired,

557
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,926
but you're coming all this way.

558
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,469
I can come out for a second.

559
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:13,648
What's with her?

560
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,866
I almost forgot.

561
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,333
Spin for me!

562
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,876
Here. Take this.

563
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,044
I hate leopard print.

564
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,712
It's this season's new item!

565
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:39,173
This will highlight your face!

566
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:41,259
It's not needed. It's already settled.

567
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,343
What do you mean?

568
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,678
Are you saying it's over?

569
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,263
No, it's not that.

570
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,391
I can't put my faith in Mi-jin.
I'll have to seal the deal.

571
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,559
- There's no need--
- Wait. There's no time.

572
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,353
Why don't you listen to me?

573
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,993
You're busy.
How did you find time to come?

574
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:10,121
Are you upset
we can't see each other often?

575
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,832
Do I look like someone
who isn't understanding of that?

576
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:13,958
Well, I'm not.

577
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,087
I want to see you often too,

578
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,964
but I didn't want to wake you this late.

579
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,717
Why would you worry about me sleeping?

580
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,552
Okay, fine.

581
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,387
I'll come all the time. I mean it.

582
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,764
Well, it's fine
if you were worried about me.

583
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:31,892
I stay at home after sunset,
and my parents are here too.

584
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,312
I didn't come because I was worried.

585
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,023
When I come and see you,

586
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,984
I don't have to look for you in my dreams.

587
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:45,656
So are you saying
if you don't come and see me,

588
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,783
you won't be able to sleep or something?

589
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,618
Yeah, I'll have to come every day.

590
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:50,828
So I can get my sleep.

591
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:56,125
- Right. What are you doing this weekend?
- This weekend?

592
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,210
You're busy on the weekends. Why?

593
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,296
Still, I can make some time for you.

594
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,214
- Let's grab lunch--
- No!

595
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,093
I don't think that's right.

596
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:07,803
Why?

597
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,765
Seeing each other at lunch is too early.

598
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:13,934
How is that too early?

599
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:15,936
Then, how about 3:00 p.m.--

600
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:19,023
Goodness! That's an even more
uncertain time of day.

601
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,610
Those who had lunch,
those going to eat, those going home.

602
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,028
There's so much traffic.

603
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:27,323
- Right? Don't you think?
- Is that so?

604
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:29,825
How about 6:00 p.m. for dinner--

605
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:32,078
Or if we meet way past 7:00 p.m.,

606
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,829
that would just be perfect.

607
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,247
No? Is that too late?

608
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:37,249
It sounds perfect and not too crowded.

609
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,891
Seeing each other at lunch is too early.

610
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,018
How about we meet after 7:00 p.m.?

611
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,645
That would just be perfect.

612
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,793
LIST OF FENTANYL TRANSACTIONS IN SEOHAN

613
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,506
I'm going to quit after this case.

614
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:29,635
Once this case is solved,
do you want to go to Seoul with me?

615
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,140
Even if I go, it won't be with you.

616
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,057
Why not?

617
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:38,352
I know you messed up coming here.
My background can make up for that.

618
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,479
Does it look like I messed up?

619
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,568
I came here to live a proper life.

620
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:50,281
I thought solving this case would lighten
the burden in my heart a bit.

621
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,367
Burden? What burden?

622
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:56,871
Also, quitting your job
as a prosecutor is a good idea.

623
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,664
You go all out in whatever you do.

624
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:02,710
I think you'll be the best attorney
for your future clients.

625
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:10,217
How embarrassing.

626
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,557
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

627
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:17,641
Seriously?

628
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:22,855
Why does she put on
so much lipstick at night?

629
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,107
Damn it. I bet it won't come off.

630
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:31,697
I'll clean that.

631
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,199
Gosh, you worked until late.

632
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,742
I'm sure you're exhausted.

633
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:35,701
I'll do it.

634
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:36,702
It's okay.

635
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:45,878
By the way, I was wondering

636
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:48,964
about your niece's friend.

637
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,674
Yes, Ga-yeong...

638
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:51,634
Her friend...

639
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,511
- Mi-jin?
- Yes.

640
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,514
Do you know what she does for work?

641
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,182
Why are you curious about that?

642
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,643
She hates the idea
of meeting during the day.

643
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,896
I'm sure there's a reason why,
so I was wondering if you knew.

644
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,273
I don't know.

645
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:08,484
During the day...

646
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:12,905
I think she had a reason
why she couldn't see people.

647
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:17,117
But don't you think you should respect
her personal matters?

648
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:19,203
But it's so strange.

649
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:22,414
Why avoid daytime instead of nighttime?

650
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:23,791
Unless she's hiding something--

651
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,000
She's not hiding anything!

652
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,923
There is such a thing as privacy.

653
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:34,051
Couples should respect that.

654
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:36,845
I never said we were dating.
How did you know?

655
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,349
Ga-yeong told me you two were dating.

656
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:41,267
What?

657
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:43,727
Sorry?

658
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,146
She said it was a secret.

659
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:49,024
She said to keep it a secret
but told everyone.

660
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:53,112
I think I overheard the two
whispering about their plans this weekend.

661
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:54,613
That must be why.

662
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,657
That's probably why she said no.

663
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,285
But she's said no for other days too.

664
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,703
Anyway, okay.

665
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:03,163
Gosh, why were you so curious?

666
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:07,418
You know, she might be
allergic to the sun too.

667
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,462
She doesn't go out much during the day.

668
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:11,922
- What?
- Nothing.

669
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,091
I should wash the dishes.

670
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,723
That's very strange.

671
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,102
After being scammed,
one thing I learned was

672
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,855
there's usually a reason
why something feels off.

673
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:36,155
I've heard of being unreachable at night,
but not being able to meet during the day?

674
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,657
That's really strange.

675
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:39,658
By any chance,

676
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,369
is she allergic to the sun or something?

677
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:45,789
Is she avoiding you
because her skin becomes weird?

678
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,708
That stuff doesn't matter to me.

679
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,209
Come on. It's different for women.

680
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:50,878
You really don't know anything.

681
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:55,549
But you said you don't know
where she works or what she does.

682
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:58,761
That's the bigger problem.

683
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:06,352
Look, you keep hiding at my house,
but it can't go on forever.

684
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,020
Don't your parents say anything?

685
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,271
I don't know.

686
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,775
Maybe they're up to something.

687
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:16,528
It's absolutely hectic at my house.
They probably don't know I left.

688
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:19,406
True. Your parents
aren't the issue right now.

689
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:21,408
Your relationship's a disaster.

690
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,286
If I keep avoiding him
during the day like this,

691
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,121
he'd think it's weird, right?

692
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:27,081
He already does.

693
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:29,375
It'd be weird if he didn't already.

694
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,417
Jeez.

695
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:31,919
Is there any solution?

696
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:34,088
Just tell him the truth.

697
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:37,091
About how I faked my identity
to get a job?

698
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,718
You want me to tell him
I've been Lim Sun all this time?

699
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,261
No, you can't do that.

700
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:43,055
You'd be sent to jail immediately.

701
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:44,473
Goodness.

702
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:47,643
Of all people,
you just had to date a prosecutor.

703
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:48,811
I know.

704
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,313
How could someone like me

705
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,190
even think about dating?

706
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:56,777
Instead of crying about your situation,
think about what you'll do.

707
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,906
What? Did you think of a great idea?

708
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,658
No, I have to poop.

709
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:04,993
Where's my phone?

710
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:06,745
Just go and poop!

711
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:09,456
You said not to use phones
while pooping!

712
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:10,749
It's not. It's doing business.

713
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:18,048
She must be here.

714
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,925
You said she had plans with your neighbor.

715
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,302
Are they meeting here?

716
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:23,762
I'll go and see.

717
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:26,265
- All of a sudden?
- I'm an investigator.

718
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:27,224
It's suspicious.

719
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,059
I can go upstairs and check.

720
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:32,271
There's really no need for that,

721
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,397
but if you must...

722
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,424
Who is it?

723
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:08,390
Hey!

724
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,559
What do we do? It's the investigator!

725
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,729
- What do we do?
- Send him away!

726
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:15,189
Damn it.

727
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,234
Hello, Mr. Ju.

728
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,570
What brings you here?

729
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,905
We're neighbors.

730
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,573
I made some food to share.

731
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,950
- I thought it would be polite.
- I see.

732
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,243
Here you go.

733
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:29,786
What's this?

734
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:32,456
I made this myself.

735
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:38,921
My goodness... This unexpected charm.

736
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,214
Wow.

737
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,469
Would you like to come in?

738
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:48,388
- Okay, if you don't mind.
- Not at all.

739
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:49,932
What the hell?

740
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,225
Why is he coming in?

741
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:53,101
Ta-da! This is my home.

742
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,062
Yes. Goodness.

743
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,981
Would you like some tea?

744
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:58,899
I'd love some.

745
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:01,318
I'd like some hot tea
so I can drink it slowly.

746
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,611
Okay.

747
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:04,613
Send him out now.

748
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,324
Just hold on. I'm sorry!

749
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,700
I have to go to the bathroom!

750
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,202
So you were by yourself?

751
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:28,720
What were you...

752
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,472
What were you saying?

753
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,308
By any chance...

754
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,366
do you like spicy pig's trotters?

755
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:52,327
I love it.

756
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:54,246
- Wow.
- Always level-three spiciness.

757
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:59,334
I never thought I'd meet someone
with the same tastes like this.

758
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:03,088
Since you're here,
would you like to join me for some?

759
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,719
Okay, then. Have a seat over here.

760
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,845
Make yourself at home.

761
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,399
He went up a while ago.
What's taking so long?

762
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,535
This spaghetti is so good.

763
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:36,246
This is just how I like
my spicy pig's trotter's too.

764
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,628
We can't eat
spicy pig's trotters without this.

765
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,254
It's an irresistible combination.

766
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,841
Why would we need to resist it?

767
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:52,763
You're so thoughtful.

768
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:01,938
MI-JIN

769
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,079
This is nice.

770
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,040
This combination is great.

771
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,792
Were those fireworks?

772
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:05,627
No.

773
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:09,131
So? Did you see her?

774
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:12,634
- Well?
- The thing is...

775
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:17,973
She was so kind
she even invited me into her home.

776
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,307
So what did you see?

777
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:22,728
And we have the same tastes.
How can I put it?

778
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:25,480
We're so compatible when it comes to food.

779
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,732
By the way...

780
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,152
I think she fell for my cooking.

781
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:32,320
So who did you see?

782
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,989
Am I speaking another language?

783
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,365
- Is this a hard question?
- Sorry.

784
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,035
But seriously, why did I go upstairs?

785
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:40,370
Wow.

786
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:42,956
Forget it. Let's just stop talking.

787
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,960
But Ms. Lim was upstairs.

788
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:50,797
Please open the door! Seriously!

789
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:53,425
I have to go before the sun rises!

790
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:54,843
How? It's broken.

791
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:57,429
You broke it.
Why are you going in there?

792
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,767
Hey, are you insane?

793
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,185
Sir! I'm going to fall!

794
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:08,064
- Wait!
- I'm here!

795
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:09,149
Ms. Lee Mi-jin.

796
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:12,944
Ms. Lim!

797
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:14,488
What are you doing here?

798
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,239
Why would I be here?

799
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:21,244
I heard those two say they were going to
meet and do something this weekend.

800
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:23,371
By the way,

801
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:24,956
your neighbor...

802
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,544
is quite beautiful.

803
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,214
The way she looks at me...

804
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:42,599
Seriously...

805
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,726
You couldn't wait
and just had to come out?

806
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:46,144
You could've just waited a bit.

807
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:50,398
Hey, I didn't come out
just because I had to poop.

808
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:51,983
I came out to save you.

809
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:54,528
Why would you need to save me?

810
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,321
Mr. Ju has a partner.

811
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:57,239
A partner?

812
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:58,949
What do you mean?

813
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:02,619
Don't tell me.

814
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:07,040
He's been off the market for a while.

815
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:14,089
Hey, don't get involved with a married man
and be a part of that drama.

816
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:18,426
Take care of your subscribers instead.
They're your flesh and blood, you brat.

817
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,771
I didn't see anything unusual
in front of Lee Mi-jin's house.

818
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:32,899
It's not that. I'm sorry,
but I have to check something.

819
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:36,194
I just emailed you the dashcam footage.

820
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,737
Thank you so much.

821
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:35,670
Ms. Lim?

822
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:52,771
PHONES, RECORDERS,
AND OTHER ELECTRONIC DEVICES PROHIBITED

823
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:55,523
I smelled something.

824
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:57,359
Something I'd never smelled before.

825
00:53:58,151 --> 00:53:59,694
It didn't smell like blood.

826
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:02,489
It was too unique to be an air freshener.

827
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:03,949
I don't know.

828
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,951
But if I were to smell it again,

829
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:08,286
I'd recognize it.

830
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:11,331
A unique air freshener?

831
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:13,833
A unique air freshener.

832
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:15,043
A unique...

833
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:29,391
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

834
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:30,600
PROSECUTOR GYE JI-UNG

835
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,361
- Are you busy?
- Yeah.

836
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:45,240
- I have to talk to you. You have time?
- About what?

837
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:47,575
Have some coffee with me.

838
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,720
Do you want some coffee?

839
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,138
No.

840
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,978
I cross-checked Baek Cheol-gyu's list.

841
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:16,396
How?

842
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:18,898
It's been so long
that some names could've changed.

843
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:22,318
Right. So you looked into everyone
with the same last names?

844
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,112
But...

845
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:25,280
GONG GI-CHEOL

846
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,906
There was one that stood out.

847
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:28,908
"Gong Gi-cheol"?

848
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:32,078
It was the same last name as Gong Eun-sim,
who made a deal 20 years ago,

849
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,163
so I checked to be sure.

850
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,748
But Gong Eun-sim's a woman.

851
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:35,957
Gong Gi-cheol's a man.

852
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:37,792
No, she's a woman.

853
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:39,669
It's Gong Eun-sim's new name.

854
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:41,796
GONG EUN-SIM

855
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,716
GONG GI-CHEOL

856
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:48,136
So she reappears after 20 years.

857
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,972
Suspicious, right?
She even changed her name.

858
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:55,560
What do you say?

859
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,062
Want to get a drink after--

860
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:58,646
Damn it!

861
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:00,815
You ate my money!

862
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:04,152
Damn it, that scared me.

863
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:05,278
Why won't it work?

864
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:06,946
Ms. Lim, don't get worked up.

865
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:08,281
It does that sometimes.

866
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:09,824
It keeps stealing my money.

867
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:10,825
- Is that so?
- Yes.

868
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:12,619
Hold on.

869
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,079
- Do I have any coins?
- Here.

870
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,081
- It kept eating mine.
- I see.

871
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:19,751
It's working fine though.

872
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:21,377
- What?
- What do you want?

873
00:56:21,377 --> 00:56:22,378
Something sweet.

874
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:23,797
- Lemon-lime soda?
- Yes.

875
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,843
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

876
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:31,513
- Do you want one too?
- No, I'm fine.

877
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:41,648
Welcome back.

878
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:42,565
Thanks.

879
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:45,652
Can you look into this woman
named Gong Eun-sim?

880
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:47,195
Her new name's Gong Gi-cheol.

881
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:50,073
"Gong Eun-sim."

882
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:53,201
And then...

883
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:57,038
If she's been buying for 24 years,
she's a true regular.

884
00:56:57,038 --> 00:57:00,416
Buying on the dark web
would've been impossible 24 years ago.

885
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:01,626
That's likely her real name.

886
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:03,461
What if it was an assumed name?

887
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:06,256
After her last deal over 20 years ago,
she bought again recently.

888
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:09,843
If she used an assumed name,
buying again would've been impossible.

889
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:10,885
What?

890
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:13,888
- This was right before the incident.
- That's right.

891
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,058
Can we find her though?

892
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:18,101
Gong Eun-sim.

893
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:21,646
I have my ways of finding old-timers.

894
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:23,106
What?

895
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,560
THERE'S A SENIOR INTERN WHO LIED

896
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:02,770
What's that?

897
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:04,481
Nothing.

898
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,398
It's nothing.

899
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:07,108
- What is it? Give it to me.
- No...

900
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,868
Explain what this is to me.

901
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:20,955
What is this?

902
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:25,168
It's an anonymous letter
that someone's been sending to Mr. Cha.

903
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:28,421
You should've told me first then!

904
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:30,089
I wanted to handle it myself.

905
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,967
I wanted to protect you.

906
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:42,894
How did you know it was a cleaning lady?

907
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:45,021
I learned they come by during lunch.

908
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:47,315
So I hid in the office
and watched it for days.

909
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:49,567
I followed her today to be sure.

910
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,870
Did you leave this behind?

911
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:03,706
I don't know anything about this.

912
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:05,667
I saw you leave it.

913
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,294
I swear.

914
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:09,837
Someone asked me to do it.

915
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:12,882
I had no idea
what was written in this letter.

916
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,801
Right, so who asked you to do this?

917
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,928
Gosh.

918
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:19,681
It was someone I used to work with.

919
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:21,099
They begged me to do it.

920
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:22,976
I'm sorry.

921
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:23,893
It's okay.

922
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:27,313
But I won't get fired for this, will I?

923
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:28,773
No.

924
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:31,609
So could you tell me
who asked you to do this?

925
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,153
Goodness.

926
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:36,030
Please, I need your help.

927
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:39,075
Gosh.

928
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:55,383
Are you okay by yourself?

929
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:58,469
Wait.

930
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:01,973
I'll be right here,
so call me if anything happens.

931
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:04,809
Okay.

932
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:26,664
Sir?

933
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:29,626
Where can I find this place?

934
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,768
HELP WANTED
MANUAL LABOR

935
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:51,356
Is anyone home?

936
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:04,994
What is it?

937
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:10,416
Are you the one who sent this?

938
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:12,585
Wait.

939
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:14,587
- I have nothing to say. Leave!
- No, I--

940
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,636
Didn't you send this letter to talk to me?

941
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:26,683
Who are you?

942
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:40,488
Do you know how precious that job is
for those who live hand-to-mouth?

943
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:45,410
But that person was hired!

944
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:48,705
At our age, we all know
how unfair the world is.

945
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,289
It'd be odd if it were fair.

946
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:54,961
The thing is I definitely recognized them,

947
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:56,879
but they were someone else.

948
01:01:58,172 --> 01:02:00,049
A different person?

949
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:01,718
It's unfair that I wasn't hired,

950
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,554
but seeing a fraud get the job
was too much to bear!

951
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,222
That's why I sent the letter!

952
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:07,140
Wait.

953
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,766
Then, who is this person?

954
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:10,393
Where did I put it?

955
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:12,353
Where is it?

956
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:17,817
Here.

957
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:20,653
SEOHAN NEWS

958
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:29,495
What?

959
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:30,705
Na Ok-hui?

960
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:31,748
Who?

961
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,292
She isn't Na Ok-hui.

962
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:29,305
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

963
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:30,932
Gong Eun-sim?

964
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:35,394
Do you think similar cases have occurred
since my return by coincidence?

965
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:38,356
How do you know our Sun?
Who's that lady?

966
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:41,943
- Come here! Hey, lady!
- There she goes!

967
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:44,111
Is that you, Ms. Lim?

968
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:45,780
Who in the world are you?

969
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:48,699
-I can't do it anymore.
- Let's tell them.

970
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:49,700
And let's go to jail.

971
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,202
What? Jail?

972
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:54,872
If you get caught or things go south,
it's not my fault.

973
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:58,459
So her name was Lee Mi-jin.

974
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:07,051
