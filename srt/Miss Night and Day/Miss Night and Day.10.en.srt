Aside from working here, the hospital is
the only other place Baek goes.

10
00:00:33,664 --> 00:00:35,499
I'm sure we'll find something there.

11
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:39,252
Mr. Ju, you take
the medicine storage room here.

12
00:00:39,336 --> 00:00:41,254
I'll take the basement storage.

Damn it, what do I look for?

19
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:01,626
A DNA test.

21
00:02:43,126 --> 00:02:44,503

Okay.

26
00:03:31,216 --> 00:03:32,801
I'll go straight to Ward 2 now.

27
00:03:32,884 --> 00:03:34,427
Just wait one moment.

28
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:10,255
<i>Mr. Ju, where are you?</i>

29
00:04:25,645 --> 00:04:26,563
Sir!

30
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:33,111
These are Lim Sun's blood test results.

31
00:04:33,737 --> 00:04:35,405
Okay. Hurry up and find her.

Lim Sun,

38
00:05:18,782 --> 00:05:19,699
who…

39
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:22,577
are you?

40
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:14,504
There's too much foot traffic here.

41
00:06:14,587 --> 00:06:16,464
He wouldn't hide them
out in the open.

42
00:06:16,548 --> 00:06:19,467
Nothing to report
from the medicine storage room.

00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:41,906

45
00:06:42,532 --> 00:06:43,616

Ms. Lim.

49
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,017
Ma'am! What are you doing?

50
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,363
Mr. Ju! Quickly!

51
00:08:48,366 --> 00:08:49,909
Ma'am!

52
00:08:51,536 --> 00:08:52,579
What in the world?

53
00:08:54,122 --> 00:08:56,207
Hello? Security?

54
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,793
Some crazy lady
tried to steal my access card!

55
00:09:01,296 --> 00:09:03,756
Mr. Gye!

56
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,133
- Get in!
- Let's go!

57
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,010
Where's Ms. Lim?

58
00:09:07,093 --> 00:09:08,178
Ms. Lim? Wait.

59
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:10,013
- Get in!
- Ms. Lim, hurry!

60
00:09:10,096 --> 00:09:11,556
- Hurry!
- Get in the front!

61
00:09:12,223 --> 00:09:13,224
She's not in yet!

62
00:09:15,101 --> 00:09:16,477
Wait a moment! Wait!

63
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:17,395
Hey, lady!

64
00:09:17,478 --> 00:09:19,606
Lady, wait!

65
00:09:21,816 --> 00:09:23,193
Are you okay?

66
00:09:23,735 --> 00:09:24,611
Yes.

67
00:09:26,196 --> 00:09:28,239
Thank you so much for earlier.

68
00:09:28,323 --> 00:09:31,242
- What? Did something happen?
- Yes, something happened.

69
00:09:31,326 --> 00:09:33,077
I might need four weeks to recover.

70
00:09:33,161 --> 00:09:34,412
So what happened was--

71
00:09:34,495 --> 00:09:35,622
Did you find anything?

72
00:09:35,705 --> 00:09:38,082
Right. This belongs to Director Baek.

73
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,460
I took it just in case.

74
00:09:40,543 --> 00:09:42,295
Let's have it tested for drugs.

75
00:09:42,921 --> 00:09:43,880
And you, Mr. Ju?

76
00:09:44,923 --> 00:09:48,009
There were many boxes
of fentanyl in the pharmacy.

77
00:09:48,092 --> 00:09:49,510
These are all fentanyl.

78
00:09:50,845 --> 00:09:54,599
I'll make a NIMS request to the Ministry
of Food and Drug Safety about them.

79
00:09:54,682 --> 00:09:56,392
Did you find anything, Mr. Gye?

80
00:09:56,476 --> 00:09:58,853
I found this in the basement storage.

81
00:09:58,937 --> 00:10:01,189
It didn't look like an ordinary drug,
so I brought it.

82
00:10:02,023 --> 00:10:04,525
I'll ask the NFS to analyze this.

83
00:10:04,609 --> 00:10:06,319
These are Lim Sun's blood test results.

84
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,655
Was there anything else?

85
00:10:09,989 --> 00:10:10,907
Yes.

86
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,910
There was. I was actually trapped
inside the pharmacy.

87
00:10:13,993 --> 00:10:17,872
I was trapped, and who knew I'd have to
use my wits as an investigator?

88
00:10:17,956 --> 00:10:21,501
Well, I expected it,
but I hid everywhere and I…

89
00:10:23,753 --> 00:10:25,338
couldn't get caught…

90
00:10:26,172 --> 00:10:28,299
<i>Why would he run a blood test on me?</i>

91
00:10:29,008 --> 00:10:30,468
<i>Is he after Aunt Sun?</i>

92
00:10:31,344 --> 00:10:32,345
<i>Why Aunt Sun?</i>

93
00:10:33,054 --> 00:10:34,764
<i>What does Director Baek Cheol-gyu</i>

94
00:10:35,348 --> 00:10:37,600
<i>want with my aunt?</i>

00:10:46,526 --> 00:10:48,695
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

DRESSING ROOM

97
00:11:12,218 --> 00:11:13,219
Goodness.

98
00:11:13,302 --> 00:11:14,637
Hey, Ms. Na.

99
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:18,391
We couldn't catch a glimpse of you
when you moved to the prosecutor's office.

100
00:11:18,474 --> 00:11:20,852
So what brings you
to this humble men's dressing room?

101
00:11:20,935 --> 00:11:21,769
Gosh.

102
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,229
It's not like that.

103
00:11:24,981 --> 00:11:28,067
By the way, I don't see Dr. Baek.

104
00:11:28,151 --> 00:11:29,944
I think he took a few days off.

105
00:11:31,362 --> 00:11:33,948
You've been very interested
in Director Baek lately.

106
00:11:35,116 --> 00:11:37,326
- What's your deal?
- Me?

107
00:11:37,952 --> 00:11:39,537
Is something going on between you two?

108
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,831
Come on! There's nothing going on.

109
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:44,417
Not at all.

110
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,169
I'll see you later.

111
00:12:12,403 --> 00:12:14,113
Why did he suddenly go on leave?

112
00:12:14,989 --> 00:12:16,449
And a few days at that.

113
00:12:34,383 --> 00:12:35,802
But isn't it strange?

114
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:36,719
What is?

115
00:12:36,803 --> 00:12:38,346
Baek Cheol-gyu is well-off.

116
00:12:38,429 --> 00:12:40,223
Why would he turn to selling drugs?

117
00:12:41,015 --> 00:12:43,017
That's what we need to try and find out.

118
00:12:45,603 --> 00:12:46,813
How's your leg?

119
00:12:47,188 --> 00:12:48,773
Yes, I'm sure it'll heal quick.

120
00:12:53,778 --> 00:12:54,779
Mr. Gye.

121
00:12:56,197 --> 00:12:59,242
They say Director Baek
has taken leave from work.

122
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:00,243
All of a sudden?

123
00:13:00,952 --> 00:13:03,371
You don't think
anything will happen, do you?

124
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:09,710
Are you worried about something?

125
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:13,840
No, it's nothing.

126
00:13:32,191 --> 00:13:33,151
DIRECTOR BAEK CHEOL-GYU

127
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:51,752
Has the time come for us now
to put this to an end?

128
00:13:59,218 --> 00:14:01,637
This didn't get nearly enough views.

129
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:03,931
I'll have to edit this lost pet ad again.

130
00:14:17,737 --> 00:14:18,905
Mi-jin?

131
00:14:19,822 --> 00:14:20,781
So…

132
00:14:20,865 --> 00:14:23,951
Did he sue you for sexual assault
after rejecting your kisser?

133
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:31,876
Hello?

134
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:35,004
- What?
- Did he sue you for sexual assault?

135
00:14:35,087 --> 00:14:36,088
Sexual…

136
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:37,840
Hey!

137
00:14:37,924 --> 00:14:41,344
Hey, I didn't even kiss him on the lips.

138
00:14:41,427 --> 00:14:43,554
I kissed his palm.

139
00:14:43,638 --> 00:14:45,181
How is that sexual assault?

140
00:14:45,264 --> 00:14:49,185
The thing about sexual assault
is not where on the body it happened.

141
00:14:49,268 --> 00:14:51,729
It's about if that person
felt offended or not.

142
00:14:51,812 --> 00:14:53,105
That's what's important.

143
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:54,440
Felt offended?

144
00:14:54,524 --> 00:14:55,358
I mean…

145
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,902
But the mood was just…

146
00:14:59,237 --> 00:15:00,238
It felt right.

147
00:15:01,113 --> 00:15:03,115
Jeez, you moron.

148
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,117
If you're going to do something crazy,

149
00:15:05,201 --> 00:15:08,663
I told you to make sure you have
at least a 51% chance of success.

150
00:15:08,746 --> 00:15:09,747
Look, my friend.

151
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:16,254
In that situation, how can I be sure
that I have a 51, 49, 70, or 1% chance?

152
00:15:16,337 --> 00:15:17,463
How can I know?

153
00:15:17,547 --> 00:15:19,048
True. You wouldn't know.

154
00:15:20,174 --> 00:15:21,259
But it's okay.

155
00:15:21,342 --> 00:15:24,262
It's okay. I can fix all of this for you.

156
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:25,763
Don't worry.

157
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:28,224
You can trust me. I got you!

158
00:15:28,307 --> 00:15:29,684
I'll fix everything.

159
00:15:29,767 --> 00:15:30,601
Whatever.

160
00:15:30,685 --> 00:15:31,602
Look, just…

161
00:15:32,395 --> 00:15:34,564
Were there any posts
on your message boards?

162
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:42,697
That's cold!

163
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,157
Didn't sleep well?

164
00:15:46,617 --> 00:15:47,785
I mean, yeah…

165
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:49,662
I slept well.

166
00:15:49,745 --> 00:15:52,081
- But I woke up at dawn.
- Why?

167
00:15:52,873 --> 00:15:54,750
I'm only going to drink decaf now.

168
00:15:56,002 --> 00:15:57,003
Why?

169
00:15:57,587 --> 00:16:00,256
I think my biological age
is aging rapidly.

170
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,841
All of a sudden?

171
00:16:02,425 --> 00:16:05,303
Drinking coffee after lunch
keeps me up late at night now.

172
00:16:07,972 --> 00:16:10,182
It doesn't look like
that is what's keeping you up.

173
00:16:12,018 --> 00:16:14,437
My friend's helping me
look for a lost cat,

174
00:16:15,396 --> 00:16:18,190
but we stayed up late last night
making a video for it.

175
00:16:19,442 --> 00:16:21,902
Come on.
Then, you should've told me earlier.

176
00:16:21,986 --> 00:16:23,237
I'll help you.

177
00:16:23,904 --> 00:16:25,823
BROWN AND ORANGE, BLUE EYES,
OLD SCAR ON FACE

178
00:16:30,161 --> 00:16:31,287
What?

179
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,288
What in the world?

180
00:16:32,371 --> 00:16:34,540
What's this doing here?

181
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,752
Wow! This is crazy!

182
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:39,962
Holy cow!

183
00:16:51,223 --> 00:16:53,267
<i>This is nuts. How is this real?</i>

184
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:57,730
IT LOOKS FAMILIAR
I'LL BE ON THE LOOKOUT

185
00:16:57,813 --> 00:17:00,024
WON IS SO KIND
LET'S LOOK TOGETHER, WON

186
00:17:00,107 --> 00:17:03,194
THE CAT IS SO CUTE
I SAW IT IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD

187
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:07,698
<i>Someone sent me a DM,
saying they found a similar cat.</i>

188
00:17:07,782 --> 00:17:09,408
<i>Let's go see it on the weekend.</i>

189
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,755
Hey, don't get out.

190
00:17:23,464 --> 00:17:24,632
What if word gets out?

191
00:17:24,715 --> 00:17:25,716
I can go alone.

192
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,260
It's my post.
I should see it through to the end.

193
00:17:28,344 --> 00:17:29,637
Jeez.

194
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,722
Thanks. My friend told me.

195
00:17:32,932 --> 00:17:35,351
Hundreds of millions of followers
saw your social media post.

196
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,645
It was effective thanks to that.

197
00:17:39,397 --> 00:17:41,065
I'll return the favor if I find the cat.

198
00:17:42,358 --> 00:17:43,359
But…

199
00:17:44,068 --> 00:17:45,653
you sure it's okay to go alone?

200
00:17:46,237 --> 00:17:47,655
Don't you dare get out.

201
00:17:47,738 --> 00:17:49,323
- I mean it.
- Still, let's go together--

202
00:18:05,405 --> 00:18:06,782
Are you here about the cat?

203
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:12,162
Are you the person
who said they saw the cat?

204
00:18:12,245 --> 00:18:14,581
What? Why is an old lady here?

205
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:18,835
Where's Ko Won?

206
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:22,547
Well, he only helped
with uploading the post.

207
00:18:22,631 --> 00:18:23,799
I came here alone.

208
00:18:24,508 --> 00:18:26,051
This is so annoying.

209
00:18:26,134 --> 00:18:28,386
- Did you really come alone?
- Yes.

210
00:18:29,012 --> 00:18:30,597
But where's the cat?

211
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,140
Don't be ridiculous.

212
00:18:32,224 --> 00:18:35,143
- I've never seen that cat before.
- What?

213
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:37,395
But you said you had it.

214
00:18:37,979 --> 00:18:39,815
You sent me a picture.

215
00:18:40,357 --> 00:18:41,691
It looked pretty similar.

216
00:18:41,775 --> 00:18:44,236
It's easy to Photoshop things.

217
00:18:45,862 --> 00:18:46,780
Hey, listen!

218
00:18:47,864 --> 00:18:49,783
I made this three-hour trip

219
00:18:49,866 --> 00:18:51,952
because of the DM you sent.

220
00:18:56,164 --> 00:18:57,833
For your troubles. Happy?

221
00:18:59,668 --> 00:19:01,044
No.

222
00:19:03,755 --> 00:19:04,756
Excuse me!

223
00:19:09,219 --> 00:19:11,638
- Let's go.
- Where's the cat?

224
00:19:12,389 --> 00:19:13,974
- I said let's go.
- What?

225
00:19:15,433 --> 00:19:16,434
Okay.

226
00:19:19,187 --> 00:19:20,480
Damn it.

227
00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:39,332
Still avoiding Mr. Gye's call?

228
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:40,584
Yeah. Well…

229
00:19:41,877 --> 00:19:43,879
Things are hectic, and I'm busy.

230
00:19:45,547 --> 00:19:47,340
You're so frustrating.

231
00:19:48,258 --> 00:19:49,301
Him too.

232
00:19:49,384 --> 00:19:51,303
He keeps calling you,

233
00:19:52,012 --> 00:19:54,681
so I don't think
he's not interested in you.

234
00:19:55,849 --> 00:19:57,559
And you said he only blocked your lips

235
00:19:57,642 --> 00:19:59,895
because he thought
you were going to headbutt him.

236
00:20:01,688 --> 00:20:03,732
Take this chance and just ask him.

237
00:20:03,815 --> 00:20:05,483
- Ask him what?
- "Do I like you?"

238
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,236
Or "Do you like me?"

239
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,363
- Gosh, you're so annoying.
- I know.

240
00:20:11,072 --> 00:20:12,157
You want <i>jajangmyeon</i> later?

241
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,533
Yeah, I'll order it.

242
00:20:18,788 --> 00:20:19,998
Mr. Gye!

243
00:20:21,124 --> 00:20:23,335
- Hello. How are you?
- Hello.

244
00:20:26,546 --> 00:20:27,505
Would you like one?

245
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:29,215
No, I'm fine.

246
00:20:31,593 --> 00:20:34,012
Then, would you like to
come up for a cup of tea?

247
00:20:34,095 --> 00:20:35,138
You're asking me?

248
00:20:36,514 --> 00:20:37,474
Then, some alcohol?

249
00:20:37,557 --> 00:20:38,642
No, that's…

250
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:40,936
I'll get going.

251
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:42,312
That's too bad!

252
00:20:42,395 --> 00:20:44,481
I wanted to talk to you about Mi-jin.

253
00:20:46,566 --> 00:20:47,734
What about her?

254
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,527
Take a seat.

255
00:20:52,656 --> 00:20:54,115
Is water okay?

256
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,243
But what did you want to
tell me about Mi-jin?

257
00:20:58,411 --> 00:21:01,039
I'll tell you one by one
if you take a seat.

258
00:21:02,457 --> 00:21:03,458
Is that necessary?

259
00:21:08,046 --> 00:21:10,340
To be honest, Mi-jin is…

260
00:21:11,132 --> 00:21:12,175
Just a second.

261
00:21:12,717 --> 00:21:13,718
Goodness.

262
00:21:15,261 --> 00:21:16,096
She's calling.

263
00:21:16,721 --> 00:21:17,681
You should pick up.

264
00:21:18,264 --> 00:21:19,265
Okay.

265
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:21,893
Hey, Mi-jin.

266
00:21:21,977 --> 00:21:23,728
Did you call me to buy you pig's trotters?

267
00:21:24,521 --> 00:21:26,314
Just go and buy it yourself.

268
00:21:26,398 --> 00:21:28,233
<i>Or wait until dawn.</i>

269
00:21:28,316 --> 00:21:29,317
I see.

270
00:21:29,401 --> 00:21:30,986
Why are you so busy?

271
00:21:31,069 --> 00:21:32,278
I think we're here.

272
00:21:32,862 --> 00:21:33,863
<i>This is it, right?</i>

273
00:21:33,947 --> 00:21:35,198
Goodness.

274
00:21:35,281 --> 00:21:36,408
Who's with you?

275
00:21:37,075 --> 00:21:38,243
Is it a guy?

276
00:21:38,326 --> 00:21:39,703
What? What do you want?

277
00:21:39,786 --> 00:21:40,620
Hey.

278
00:21:41,538 --> 00:21:43,373
His voice sounds so nice.

279
00:21:43,456 --> 00:21:44,874
Does his face look nice too?

280
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:48,086
<i>Anyways, I might not be able
to come in tonight.</i>

281
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:50,005
Tell my mom I'm with you if she calls.

282
00:21:51,548 --> 00:21:53,758
All right. Okay.

283
00:21:56,261 --> 00:21:57,095
Are you okay?

284
00:21:58,263 --> 00:22:00,223
Okay, have some water.

285
00:22:03,268 --> 00:22:06,104
She started dating late,
and now, she's going hard.

286
00:22:07,897 --> 00:22:10,483
Shouldn't you stop your friend
from staying out all night?

287
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:11,484
Did you hear that?

288
00:22:13,069 --> 00:22:14,154
You must have good hearing.

289
00:22:15,864 --> 00:22:16,740
But why stop her?

290
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,661
- Well, it could be dangerous.
- For Mi-jin?

291
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:25,874
Or for the guy?

292
00:22:30,378 --> 00:22:31,463
I doubt it.

293
00:22:32,922 --> 00:22:34,924
So what did you want to say earlier?

294
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,551
That's right.

295
00:22:40,513 --> 00:22:42,849
It's kind of hard for me to say this.

296
00:22:43,892 --> 00:22:46,102
Where should I begin?

297
00:23:15,715 --> 00:23:18,718
<i>The wind is blowing</i>

298
00:23:18,802 --> 00:23:20,845
Why would this song play now?

299
00:23:21,721 --> 00:23:22,931
What a weird algorithm.

300
00:23:27,602 --> 00:23:29,604
The more I think about it,
the stranger she is.

301
00:23:30,688 --> 00:23:33,399
After trying to kiss me,
she's spending a night with some guy?

302
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,278
Where is she and what is she doing?

303
00:23:40,782 --> 00:23:42,450
GPS TRACKER

304
00:23:46,621 --> 00:23:47,872
What am I doing?

305
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,416
I didn't install it for this.

306
00:23:51,793 --> 00:23:52,877
Get it together.

307
00:23:53,753 --> 00:23:55,171
Don't be lame, Ji-ung.

308
00:24:19,696 --> 00:24:21,281
CONTACTS

309
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,201
DOCUMENTS

310
00:24:25,285 --> 00:24:26,327
- Hello.
- Hello.

311
00:24:26,411 --> 00:24:28,621
- Did you report seeing the cat?
- Yes, I did.

312
00:24:28,705 --> 00:24:29,873
May I take a look?

313
00:24:29,956 --> 00:24:31,291
- Yes, that's okay.
- Okay.

314
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,627
PROSECUTOR GYE JI-UNG

315
00:24:52,103 --> 00:24:52,937
Hello?

316
00:24:57,025 --> 00:24:58,776
What? Why isn't he saying anything?

317
00:25:00,403 --> 00:25:01,613
What is it? You can tell me.

318
00:25:02,697 --> 00:25:04,574
Why are you answering Mi-jin's phone?

319
00:25:04,657 --> 00:25:07,243
You don't need to know
about Mi-jin's personal life.

320
00:25:09,662 --> 00:25:10,622
Put Mi-jin on.

321
00:25:10,705 --> 00:25:13,583
I'm sorry,
but she's not here right now.

322
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:15,043
I'll let her know.

323
00:25:15,793 --> 00:25:18,880
But the two of us are very busy today.

324
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:22,091
She can't call you right back,
so don't wait.

325
00:25:23,718 --> 00:25:24,719
She can't…

326
00:25:27,847 --> 00:25:28,932
Serves you right.

327
00:25:34,103 --> 00:25:35,480
She's with Ko Won?

328
00:25:45,323 --> 00:25:46,199
Damn it.

329
00:25:58,461 --> 00:26:00,964
It's hard for any woman
not to like Ko Won.

330
00:26:01,047 --> 00:26:03,049
- Do you agree, Mi-jin?
- About what?

331
00:26:03,132 --> 00:26:05,927
But if he did like you,
would you date him?

332
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:06,886
Yeah, answer him.

333
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,805
Would you go out with Ko Won if he asked?

334
00:26:08,888 --> 00:26:11,599
If Ko Won said that he liked me…

335
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,314
Your extra-large
spicy pig's trotters and beer.

336
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:19,816
- Thank you!
- Here's the beer.

337
00:26:19,899 --> 00:26:21,818
- Thank you.
- Let's eat first.

338
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:31,494
You can pull over here.

339
00:26:31,577 --> 00:26:32,412
Yeah.

340
00:26:32,495 --> 00:26:33,788
- Here?
- Yeah.

341
00:26:35,081 --> 00:26:35,915
Thanks…

342
00:26:37,417 --> 00:26:38,334
for today.

343
00:26:39,544 --> 00:26:41,671
Why would you thank me?
I should thank you.

344
00:26:42,296 --> 00:26:43,715
Bye. Thanks.

345
00:26:53,808 --> 00:26:55,059
<i>Don't be ridiculous.</i>

346
00:26:55,143 --> 00:26:56,019
What?

347
00:26:56,102 --> 00:26:57,895
I've never seen that cat before.

348
00:26:58,604 --> 00:27:00,314
But you said you had it.

349
00:27:00,398 --> 00:27:01,899
You sent me a picture.

350
00:27:02,525 --> 00:27:04,569
It's easy to Photoshop things.

351
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:06,154
No.

352
00:27:06,237 --> 00:27:07,071
What the…

353
00:27:07,155 --> 00:27:07,989
Excuse me!

354
00:27:12,785 --> 00:27:13,619
Take this back.

355
00:27:17,081 --> 00:27:18,082
Also…

356
00:27:22,295 --> 00:27:24,797
Thanks for being Ko Won's fan.

357
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,053
And I hope you continue to support him.

358
00:28:11,594 --> 00:28:12,595
Damn it.

359
00:28:16,349 --> 00:28:17,392
Jeez!

360
00:28:26,192 --> 00:28:27,193
Are you sure?

361
00:28:28,486 --> 00:28:29,404
Where on Obongsan?

362
00:28:29,487 --> 00:28:31,197
Well, I don't know that.

363
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,323
You don't know?

364
00:28:33,699 --> 00:28:35,660
You don't know? You need to find out.

365
00:28:35,743 --> 00:28:37,912
The entrance, summit,
hiking trail, or walking trail?

366
00:28:37,995 --> 00:28:40,623
Aren't you asking too much
from a club grunt?

367
00:28:41,582 --> 00:28:43,543
I'm not some detective or anything.

368
00:28:43,626 --> 00:28:44,877
HIKING TRAIL
OBONGSAN MOUNTAIN

369
00:28:44,961 --> 00:28:45,962
We're so screwed.

370
00:28:47,088 --> 00:28:49,132
It's buried in a place empty of people.

371
00:28:49,215 --> 00:28:51,134
It'll be away from the entrance or trails.

372
00:28:51,217 --> 00:28:53,678
This looks too broad of an area to search.

373
00:28:54,387 --> 00:28:57,056
Finding evidence is a race against time.
We need to hurry.

374
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,474
How?

375
00:29:06,649 --> 00:29:07,525
PROSECUTOR GYE JI-UNG

376
00:29:07,608 --> 00:29:09,152
You've lost so much weight.

377
00:29:09,861 --> 00:29:11,737
Getting locked up is the best diet.

378
00:29:13,698 --> 00:29:15,032
You brought me here to tease me?

379
00:29:15,867 --> 00:29:18,536
- I wanted to give you another chance.
- "Chance"?

380
00:29:19,745 --> 00:29:20,705
Jeez.

381
00:29:21,622 --> 00:29:23,374
It looks like you need my help.

382
00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:26,419
Then, this wouldn't be
"giving me a chance."

383
00:29:26,502 --> 00:29:27,962
Isn't this asking for cooperation?

384
00:29:29,464 --> 00:29:30,673
You're very arrogant.

385
00:29:31,883 --> 00:29:33,468
Aren't I the one helping you?

386
00:29:33,551 --> 00:29:35,470
The Narcotics Control Act states

387
00:29:35,553 --> 00:29:38,931
that anyone who sells or provides
narcotics to a minor will receive

388
00:29:39,015 --> 00:29:41,100
five years to life in prison.

389
00:29:41,184 --> 00:29:44,604
When did I ever sell drugs to a minor?

390
00:29:45,354 --> 00:29:46,814
Come on.

391
00:29:52,445 --> 00:29:53,279
Recognize them?

392
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,283
Those punks! I'll kill them!

393
00:29:57,366 --> 00:29:59,619
Seriously, I didn't know they were minors.

394
00:30:00,244 --> 00:30:02,079
And I didn't sell them for money,

395
00:30:02,163 --> 00:30:03,456
so why is that a problem?

396
00:30:04,457 --> 00:30:05,291
Who knows?

397
00:30:05,374 --> 00:30:08,377
Charges could change from distribution
to possession if you answer well.

398
00:30:09,337 --> 00:30:11,589
Damn it. I'm not falling for that again.

399
00:30:11,672 --> 00:30:15,301
The day after I went to the club,
they immediately stopped selling drugs

400
00:30:15,384 --> 00:30:17,261
and removed all of their goods.

401
00:30:17,845 --> 00:30:19,305
So here's my question.

402
00:30:19,388 --> 00:30:21,682
Where did they take all of these goods?

403
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:24,852
How am I supposed to know?

404
00:30:25,645 --> 00:30:28,856
I've been locked up.
I haven't been pushing for a while.

405
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,900
Hey, put some effort into your answers!

406
00:30:31,901 --> 00:30:32,902
I mean…

407
00:30:32,985 --> 00:30:33,819
Damn it.

408
00:30:33,903 --> 00:30:36,072
I should ask for ten years
instead of five, right?

409
00:30:36,155 --> 00:30:37,573
- Let's do ten.
- Ten years?

410
00:30:37,657 --> 00:30:39,158
Wait. Wait a second.

411
00:30:40,326 --> 00:30:41,536
Jeez.

412
00:30:45,206 --> 00:30:46,791
I don't know the details…

413
00:30:49,293 --> 00:30:51,170
but they said
they buried it on a mountain.

414
00:30:52,171 --> 00:30:53,714
We know it's Obongsan.

415
00:30:53,798 --> 00:30:55,758
We want to know where on Obongsan.

416
00:31:01,889 --> 00:31:03,391
Next to the pavilion at the summit.

417
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,434
Pavilion at the summit?

418
00:31:06,018 --> 00:31:08,145
Next to the pavilion
are the Five Brother Trees.

419
00:31:08,229 --> 00:31:10,731
They told me they hid them
under the last tree.

420
00:31:10,815 --> 00:31:12,650
- Did you hear that?
- Yes, I'm on it.

421
00:31:12,733 --> 00:31:15,152
You're going to reduce my sentence, right?

422
00:31:15,236 --> 00:31:16,946
We do have to consider your cooperation.

423
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:17,905
Yes. Right.

424
00:31:18,489 --> 00:31:19,949
- Take him away.
- That's it?

425
00:31:20,032 --> 00:31:20,866
Yes.

426
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:21,784
I see.

427
00:31:23,411 --> 00:31:24,245
Wait a second.

428
00:31:24,954 --> 00:31:26,247
I'll be counting on you.

429
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,456
- All right.
- Okay.

430
00:31:29,584 --> 00:31:31,794
By the way,
they apparently weren't minors.

431
00:31:33,963 --> 00:31:37,341
- They just wear their school uniforms.
- You damn fraud!

432
00:31:37,425 --> 00:31:38,551
You said they were minors!

433
00:31:38,634 --> 00:31:39,760
- Wait!
- Let's go.

434
00:31:39,844 --> 00:31:41,887
I said I'd consider your cooperation.

435
00:31:41,971 --> 00:31:44,348
How can I trust that? Wait!

436
00:31:44,432 --> 00:31:45,516
Stop moving!

437
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,726
- Come on!
- I said stop!

438
00:31:50,855 --> 00:31:52,231
Don't trust it then.

439
00:31:56,152 --> 00:31:57,153
From here…

440
00:31:59,905 --> 00:32:01,324
We have to keep going.

441
00:32:03,451 --> 00:32:06,787
- Goodness! I'm sorry, baby! I'm so sorry!
- Jeez.

442
00:32:13,002 --> 00:32:15,338
- Why did you stop?
- I can't go any further.

443
00:32:15,421 --> 00:32:17,131
We have 60 more kilometers to go.

444
00:32:17,214 --> 00:32:19,508
It'll wreck my car if we go further!

445
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:21,969
Is this why you wanted to bring my car?

446
00:32:23,012 --> 00:32:25,723
Don't be ridiculous.
Just go. There's no other way.

447
00:32:27,683 --> 00:32:28,559
Ms. Lim.

448
00:32:30,269 --> 00:32:32,229
She went and returned
in three hours last time.

449
00:32:32,605 --> 00:32:35,024
Yeah, there's no shot
without knowing a shortcut.

450
00:32:35,566 --> 00:32:37,068
Shortcut?

451
00:32:37,151 --> 00:32:38,527
<i>Hello, Mr. Ju.</i>

452
00:32:38,611 --> 00:32:39,654
Ms. Lim!

453
00:32:39,737 --> 00:32:40,821
Wait…

454
00:32:50,623 --> 00:32:53,250
Wait. You didn't climb up there
last time, did you?

455
00:32:53,334 --> 00:32:54,794
It's because I hate hiking.

456
00:32:56,045 --> 00:32:57,380
What are you doing?

457
00:32:58,422 --> 00:32:59,799
Let's finish the job quick.

458
00:32:59,882 --> 00:33:01,634
- Us too?
- Of course.

459
00:33:05,846 --> 00:33:06,847
But I'm…

460
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,808
I'm afraid of heights.

461
00:33:09,767 --> 00:33:11,143
But… What?

462
00:33:11,227 --> 00:33:12,603
Hey, where are you going?

463
00:33:12,687 --> 00:33:13,938
My leg's hurt.

464
00:33:14,021 --> 00:33:16,649
You know I'm hurt.
I won't recover if I hurt it more.

465
00:33:16,732 --> 00:33:18,693
Where are you going? I know you're healed.

466
00:33:18,776 --> 00:33:20,361
You two go and enjoy.

467
00:33:20,444 --> 00:33:21,946
Stop pretending to be hurt!

468
00:33:22,029 --> 00:33:23,406
Ouch! Wow.

469
00:33:30,496 --> 00:33:31,580
Jeez!

470
00:33:38,045 --> 00:33:39,130
What are you doing?

471
00:33:40,172 --> 00:33:41,382
Let's have a nice climb.

472
00:33:41,465 --> 00:33:42,883
No, I can't do that.

473
00:33:43,384 --> 00:33:44,927
- Wait.
- I just can't do it!

474
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:46,679
Seriously?

475
00:34:03,571 --> 00:34:05,030
- Are you okay?
- Hold on!

476
00:34:05,573 --> 00:34:06,907
How did you get up here?

477
00:34:09,618 --> 00:34:10,953
I'm sorry about last time.

478
00:34:12,538 --> 00:34:14,623
Going down is harder than climbing up.

479
00:34:14,707 --> 00:34:16,792
- There's no time. Let's go.
- Right now?

480
00:34:17,585 --> 00:34:20,171
No, let's rest for one minute!
Just one minute!

481
00:34:20,254 --> 00:34:21,589
Come on!

482
00:34:21,672 --> 00:34:23,841
What kind of supplements is she taking?

483
00:34:29,638 --> 00:34:30,723
For crying out loud!

484
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:33,184
Damn it.

485
00:34:34,143 --> 00:34:34,977
Jeez!

486
00:34:45,613 --> 00:34:46,781
Ms. Lim.

487
00:34:46,864 --> 00:34:49,033
Let's rest for just five minutes.

488
00:34:52,578 --> 00:34:55,039
Wow, I am so exhausted.

489
00:34:56,332 --> 00:34:57,291
Wow.

490
00:34:59,502 --> 00:35:01,128
I think I sprained my wrist too.

491
00:35:06,091 --> 00:35:07,426
Hello!

492
00:35:07,927 --> 00:35:10,179
- Who is he?
- He's a naturalist.

493
00:35:10,846 --> 00:35:13,891
- What?
- He came to help us find the evidence.

494
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,851
Wait for us!

495
00:35:16,811 --> 00:35:18,896
But why did he appear like that?

496
00:35:19,688 --> 00:35:20,940
He scared me to death.

497
00:35:33,202 --> 00:35:34,912
Are you sure this is it though?

498
00:35:35,996 --> 00:35:38,457
Yes. The Five Brother Trees
next to the pavilion.

499
00:35:41,377 --> 00:35:42,795
How are they Five Brother Trees?

500
00:35:44,171 --> 00:35:46,382
Not all brothers look the same.

501
00:35:47,007 --> 00:35:48,717
I mean, they're not five brothers.

502
00:35:48,801 --> 00:35:50,636
It's more like almost 20 brothers.

503
00:35:55,808 --> 00:35:59,436
Not too long ago, he saw several men
loitering around here at night.

504
00:36:00,104 --> 00:36:01,730
That could've been other people.

505
00:36:04,358 --> 00:36:06,610
He could just tell me, you know.

506
00:36:07,194 --> 00:36:08,821
He's very shy.

507
00:36:08,904 --> 00:36:10,114
What did he say?

508
00:36:10,823 --> 00:36:11,740
"Shut up and dig."

509
00:36:18,455 --> 00:36:19,331
Then,

510
00:36:20,082 --> 00:36:21,834
starting from this big tree,

511
00:36:22,501 --> 00:36:24,879
let's go all the way to the end…

512
00:36:29,967 --> 00:36:31,343
I should've come by myself.

513
00:36:54,825 --> 00:36:56,493
I found it!

514
00:36:57,286 --> 00:36:58,454
What?

515
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:03,292
What is it?

516
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:08,964
I'm feeling energized.

517
00:37:09,798 --> 00:37:11,800
This is no time
to dig for medicinal herbs.

518
00:37:25,731 --> 00:37:28,067
- Mr. Gye!
- Yes?

519
00:37:29,276 --> 00:37:31,654
- Did you find more medicinal herbs?
- Over here.

520
00:37:45,376 --> 00:37:46,377
This is it, right?

521
00:37:47,002 --> 00:37:48,003
Yes.

522
00:37:53,801 --> 00:37:56,220
Can't we just take the trail down, please?

523
00:37:56,303 --> 00:37:57,638
I'll head down first.

524
00:37:57,721 --> 00:37:59,932
I have to clock out before the sun sets.

525
00:38:00,015 --> 00:38:01,475
You're leaving me alone here?

526
00:38:01,558 --> 00:38:03,477
Yes. Bye!

527
00:38:04,144 --> 00:38:05,229
But…

528
00:38:05,854 --> 00:38:07,022
My goodness!

529
00:38:09,274 --> 00:38:10,275
Wow!

530
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,319
But…

531
00:38:15,906 --> 00:38:18,200
Where do I go to take the trail down?

532
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:22,871
Goodbye.

533
00:38:35,926 --> 00:38:38,721
Mr. Gye! Take your time, but hurry up.

534
00:38:40,431 --> 00:38:43,183
Ms. Lim clocked out ages ago.
What took you so long?

535
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:47,354
Mr. Gye!

536
00:38:47,438 --> 00:38:48,772
- I'm dying!
- Mr. Gye!

537
00:38:48,856 --> 00:38:50,524
My goodness, Mr. Gye!

538
00:38:50,607 --> 00:38:52,443
Mr. Gye!

539
00:38:52,526 --> 00:38:54,945
You could've damaged the evidence!

540
00:38:55,029 --> 00:38:57,239
I'll ask NFS to analyze these immediately.

541
00:38:58,657 --> 00:39:01,452
Please. Give me some water!

542
00:39:02,411 --> 00:39:04,747
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

543
00:39:06,415 --> 00:39:07,458
KING LAND KO WON

544
00:39:11,211 --> 00:39:12,713
Mr. Ju, any word from the NFS?

545
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,758
I asked them to compare the drugs we found

546
00:39:15,841 --> 00:39:18,552
with the one you found
at Hwadong Medical as fast as possible.

547
00:39:18,635 --> 00:39:20,345
The results will be out in three days.

548
00:39:20,429 --> 00:39:22,765
What about Director Baek's
drug test results?

549
00:39:22,848 --> 00:39:24,391
Those all came out negative.

550
00:39:27,269 --> 00:39:29,021
<i>Who's your ideal type of woman, Ko Won?</i>

551
00:39:29,104 --> 00:39:31,023
My ideal type…

552
00:39:32,191 --> 00:39:34,568
Someone who's warm and cozy.

553
00:39:35,611 --> 00:39:37,279
Do you like older women as well?

554
00:39:38,238 --> 00:39:41,075
Is an age gap that important
in a relationship?

555
00:39:41,158 --> 00:39:42,951
Then, how much older would you go?

556
00:39:43,702 --> 00:39:44,870
I don't know.

557
00:39:45,454 --> 00:39:47,498
I think ten years older is okay.

558
00:39:48,165 --> 00:39:49,416
Age is just a number.

559
00:39:50,042 --> 00:39:51,919
She's 20 years older, you punk!

560
00:39:52,002 --> 00:39:53,087
Mr. Ju!

561
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:54,213
Twenty years older!

562
00:39:54,296 --> 00:39:55,506
- Calm down!
- Please stop!

563
00:39:55,589 --> 00:39:58,884
You weren't even born
when Ms. Lim was in college!

564
00:39:58,967 --> 00:40:01,512
<i>Someone who's warm and cozy.</i>

565
00:40:01,595 --> 00:40:03,555
She's over 20 years older than you.

566
00:40:04,098 --> 00:40:05,099
Twenty years…

567
00:40:06,141 --> 00:40:07,893
What have you been doing all day?

568
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,438
Go back.

569
00:40:11,522 --> 00:40:12,898
- Go to the beginning.
- No.

570
00:40:12,981 --> 00:40:14,358
- It's nothing.
- Whatever.

571
00:40:14,441 --> 00:40:16,485
- Go back to the start.
- There's nothing there.

572
00:40:16,568 --> 00:40:18,487
Yes, there is. Go back. Now.

573
00:40:24,326 --> 00:40:26,078
A SCAR HERE

574
00:40:26,161 --> 00:40:28,330
<i>I'm looking for my dear friend's cat.</i>

575
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:30,332
<i>Please help.</i>

576
00:40:30,415 --> 00:40:32,751
<i>It's someone I care about.
I want to find it for them.</i>

577
00:40:34,294 --> 00:40:36,296
This guy's ridiculous.

578
00:40:37,965 --> 00:40:39,216
Exactly.

579
00:40:56,733 --> 00:40:59,111
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

580
00:40:59,194 --> 00:41:01,071
Come here. Come on.

581
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,031
What is it?

582
00:41:04,032 --> 00:41:06,243
I got everything
that's good for you, so take them.

583
00:41:07,202 --> 00:41:08,036
Hey…

584
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,037
Come on.

585
00:41:09,121 --> 00:41:10,747
Take a look.

586
00:41:10,831 --> 00:41:13,375
These are for your joints
because you're old.

587
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:14,626
This is lutein.

588
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:17,921
Here, this is for your eyes.
This is milk thistle.

589
00:41:18,922 --> 00:41:21,216
This is good for menopause.
Make sure to take it.

590
00:41:21,967 --> 00:41:25,262
Forget it! You take them.
Jeez, what are you doing?

591
00:41:25,345 --> 00:41:27,097
Think about your biological age.

592
00:41:27,181 --> 00:41:30,350
Wow, what if you get
age-related farsightedness? It'll be bad.

593
00:41:30,434 --> 00:41:31,268
I'll kill you!

594
00:41:32,227 --> 00:41:34,188
It's not that bad. Look.

595
00:41:36,815 --> 00:41:37,649
There we go!

596
00:41:39,109 --> 00:41:41,111
It's not medicine. They're supplements.

597
00:41:41,195 --> 00:41:42,946
- Make sure to take them.
- Forget it.

598
00:41:44,656 --> 00:41:46,116
Here, take them.

599
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,242
You're ridiculous.

600
00:41:47,326 --> 00:41:48,327
Down the hatch.

601
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,079
- It's sweet.
- Drink.

602
00:41:51,163 --> 00:41:52,539
There you go.

603
00:41:53,582 --> 00:41:55,542
- Good, right?
- It's caught in my throat.

604
00:41:55,626 --> 00:41:57,544
- Make sure to take them.
- Okay.

605
00:41:58,378 --> 00:41:59,671
He called you.

606
00:41:59,755 --> 00:42:01,381
- Who?
- Mr. Gye.

607
00:42:02,049 --> 00:42:03,759
- He called that night.
- That night?

608
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:06,094
It wasn't by mistake?

609
00:42:06,887 --> 00:42:07,971
He asked for you.

610
00:42:11,016 --> 00:42:12,184
Call him tonight, then.

611
00:42:14,478 --> 00:42:17,356
He would've called again if it was urgent.

612
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,499
You seem excited.

613
00:42:36,458 --> 00:42:37,459
What? What is it?

614
00:42:38,961 --> 00:42:40,003
Yes. So?

615
00:42:40,712 --> 00:42:41,922
Are you done with work?

616
00:42:42,506 --> 00:42:43,340
Yes.

617
00:42:46,593 --> 00:42:48,887
- I need to talk to you.
- Why?

618
00:42:50,514 --> 00:42:51,890
Follow me!

619
00:42:57,271 --> 00:42:58,355
Is he crazy?

620
00:42:58,438 --> 00:43:00,107
<i>I'm not a narrow-minded boomer.</i>

621
00:43:01,316 --> 00:43:03,068
You receive drinks with both hands.

622
00:43:06,196 --> 00:43:07,155
Both hands.

623
00:43:13,245 --> 00:43:14,871
It's etiquette to drink the first shot.

624
00:43:15,622 --> 00:43:17,249
Jeez.

625
00:43:25,716 --> 00:43:27,092
I drank it. Can I go now?

626
00:43:28,927 --> 00:43:30,053
Sit down!

627
00:43:39,354 --> 00:43:41,440
You have nothing to say,
so why tell me to sit?

628
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,987
Listen to what I'm about to say.

629
00:43:47,946 --> 00:43:51,992
If a man and woman
have a healthy relationship,

630
00:43:52,075 --> 00:43:53,952
I'm very much for it. I fully support it.

631
00:43:54,036 --> 00:43:55,787
But what you're doing isn't healthy!

632
00:43:56,371 --> 00:43:57,414
Me?

633
00:43:57,998 --> 00:43:58,832
It's very dangerous.

634
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:03,628
Why does it have to be Ms. Lim?
What kind of mischief are you up to?

635
00:44:03,712 --> 00:44:07,924
Despite her age, Ms. Lim wants
to achieve something in life.

636
00:44:08,008 --> 00:44:09,801
She works really hard.

637
00:44:11,094 --> 00:44:12,637
She types really fast too!

638
00:44:12,721 --> 00:44:16,099
Sometimes it's like I'm listening
to some percussion instrument!

639
00:44:24,816 --> 00:44:26,735
Don't swallow the glass! Spit it out.

640
00:44:29,154 --> 00:44:31,031
Wow, this guy is not normal.

641
00:44:31,114 --> 00:44:34,284
- I fully support you to the end.
- Okay.

642
00:44:34,868 --> 00:44:35,911
Look out.

643
00:44:35,994 --> 00:44:36,953
My goodness.

644
00:44:37,996 --> 00:44:40,665
What in the world? Is he sleeping?

645
00:44:40,749 --> 00:44:43,752
How many bottles did he drink?
No wonder why he's asleep.

646
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,505
Damn it.

647
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:50,050
Hey, mister?

648
00:44:50,801 --> 00:44:52,344
Let's go home. Come on.

649
00:44:53,095 --> 00:44:54,596
Sir! It's time to go home!

650
00:44:54,679 --> 00:44:55,847
Yeah.

651
00:44:56,473 --> 00:44:58,725
Let's go home.

652
00:44:58,809 --> 00:45:01,436
- Let's go.
- Ms. Lim.

653
00:45:02,771 --> 00:45:04,856
- Take care of her.
- I will. Let's go.

654
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:06,566
We have to go. We really should.

655
00:45:07,192 --> 00:45:09,402
I'll kill you if you hurt her!

656
00:45:09,486 --> 00:45:10,570
Why would I hurt her?

657
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:28,839
What's this?

658
00:45:29,548 --> 00:45:30,841
Why are they together?

659
00:45:30,924 --> 00:45:32,926
When did I ever hurt her?

660
00:45:33,009 --> 00:45:34,427
Goodness!

661
00:45:41,268 --> 00:45:43,687
I can't even leave him here. Damn it.

662
00:45:45,814 --> 00:45:46,690
Sir?

663
00:45:47,566 --> 00:45:49,109
Get up. Come on. Let's go.

664
00:45:51,528 --> 00:45:52,362
Up like this.

665
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:56,241
- Wake up!
- Wake up!

666
00:45:59,327 --> 00:46:00,203
Seriously?

667
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:02,581
Okay.

668
00:46:09,713 --> 00:46:10,672
- Hey, mister.
- Yeah?

669
00:46:10,755 --> 00:46:12,299
- What's your password?
- What?

670
00:46:12,382 --> 00:46:14,176
- Please buy me some pho.
- No!

671
00:46:14,259 --> 00:46:16,219
Not pho. What's your password?

672
00:46:17,304 --> 00:46:18,513
Just a second.

673
00:46:19,097 --> 00:46:21,266
Look over here. There you go.

674
00:46:22,267 --> 00:46:25,395
Okay, again. One more time.

675
00:46:26,688 --> 00:46:28,773
Damn it.

676
00:46:29,566 --> 00:46:30,692
We need to…

677
00:46:40,368 --> 00:46:41,369
Hello?

678
00:46:41,453 --> 00:46:43,121
This is some guy's phone.

679
00:46:57,093 --> 00:47:00,096
- Ko Won!
- Ko Won!

680
00:47:02,224 --> 00:47:03,266
What happened?

681
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:04,559
That's what I want to know.

682
00:47:06,061 --> 00:47:07,062
Mr. Ju?

683
00:47:07,854 --> 00:47:09,189
Mr. Ju!

684
00:47:09,731 --> 00:47:10,732
He can't hold his liquor.

685
00:47:10,815 --> 00:47:12,525
Why did you let him get drunk?

686
00:47:14,527 --> 00:47:16,279
- Mr. Ju?
- What?

687
00:47:17,113 --> 00:47:18,156
You think I drugged him?

688
00:47:23,078 --> 00:47:24,913
Snap out of it, will you?

689
00:47:24,996 --> 00:47:26,623
Ms. Lim likes pink.

690
00:47:26,706 --> 00:47:27,749
What's he talking about?

691
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,335
Help me. Grab his bag.

692
00:47:30,418 --> 00:47:33,088
- You've got to be kidding.
- Mr. Ju, get up.

693
00:47:35,799 --> 00:47:37,175
I knew he'd cause trouble again.

694
00:47:38,885 --> 00:47:41,012
You are just the worst.

695
00:47:46,268 --> 00:47:47,102
Come on.

696
00:47:47,185 --> 00:47:48,270
Excuse us.

697
00:47:49,354 --> 00:47:50,188
Goodness.

698
00:47:53,733 --> 00:47:54,734
Get in.

699
00:47:59,739 --> 00:48:01,157
Jeez. Take his bag too.

700
00:48:04,035 --> 00:48:05,036
Get in.

701
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:06,746
Forget it.

702
00:48:07,872 --> 00:48:10,250
All this exposure
won't do you any good. Get in.

703
00:48:19,426 --> 00:48:23,013
Sir, please hurry to a pho restaurant.

704
00:48:23,096 --> 00:48:24,097
Hurry.

705
00:48:30,603 --> 00:48:31,688
- Then--
- Hey…

706
00:48:33,231 --> 00:48:34,274
Go ahead.

707
00:48:36,484 --> 00:48:39,529
- What's your relationship with Mi-jin?
- What do you mean?

708
00:48:42,449 --> 00:48:43,700
I just wanted to be sure.

709
00:48:55,712 --> 00:48:57,589
I hate getting in between two people.

710
00:49:09,809 --> 00:49:10,977
Jeez.

711
00:49:14,314 --> 00:49:15,690
Gosh, you're so heavy.

712
00:49:26,868 --> 00:49:28,745
Why does he drink so much?

713
00:49:37,087 --> 00:49:38,755
<i>What's your relationship with Mi-jin?</i>

714
00:49:41,132 --> 00:49:43,510
I hate getting in between two people.

715
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:00,860
DOCUMENTS

716
00:50:06,491 --> 00:50:07,659
Darn it.

717
00:50:27,178 --> 00:50:28,555
- Does it hurt?
- A little.

718
00:50:34,978 --> 00:50:37,188
Did I overreact?

719
00:50:38,022 --> 00:50:38,982
Well…

720
00:50:40,066 --> 00:50:43,194
What happens if someone was
temporarily insane due to alcohol?

721
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:47,907
Things will depend on if the incident
was an accident or not.

722
00:50:49,451 --> 00:50:51,119
I see.

723
00:50:53,872 --> 00:50:55,540
Then, this isn't an accident.

724
00:50:56,207 --> 00:50:57,375
What isn't an accident?

725
00:50:58,793 --> 00:51:01,254
Gosh, that blasted alcohol.

726
00:51:04,549 --> 00:51:05,508
By the way…

727
00:51:07,051 --> 00:51:08,803
what were you going to say earlier?

728
00:51:13,308 --> 00:51:14,350
I'll call you.

729
00:51:16,311 --> 00:51:17,937
Why has he stopped calling?

730
00:51:23,776 --> 00:51:24,652
Whatever.

731
00:52:03,274 --> 00:52:04,776
DOCUMENTS

732
00:52:08,238 --> 00:52:10,740
POWER OFF

733
00:52:10,823 --> 00:52:12,992
DOCUMENTS

734
00:52:17,455 --> 00:52:20,041
<i>The number you have dialed
is unavailable…</i>

735
00:52:27,632 --> 00:52:29,384
Gosh, this is bothering me so much.

736
00:52:53,355 --> 00:52:54,189
Mr. Gye?

737
00:52:57,275 --> 00:53:00,403
That sofa must be comfortable.
Everyone sleeps so well on it.

738
00:53:00,987 --> 00:53:03,198
Has someone else slept here too?

739
00:53:05,367 --> 00:53:06,993
Just a friend.

740
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,580
But how did I get here?

741
00:53:10,664 --> 00:53:13,083
How do you think? I dragged you here.

742
00:53:14,793 --> 00:53:16,670
There's no time. Eat so we can go to work.

743
00:53:16,753 --> 00:53:18,129
Wait. What time is it?

744
00:53:18,213 --> 00:53:19,798
Is there any pho around here?

745
00:53:19,881 --> 00:53:22,217
You've been asking for pho
since last night!

746
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,094
You thought I was a driver too.

747
00:53:24,177 --> 00:53:25,845
- Don't eat it then.
- Okay. Fine.

748
00:53:27,138 --> 00:53:28,515
- Eat it quickly.
- Okay.

749
00:53:30,517 --> 00:53:32,477
- Can I get a latte?
- Are you kidding me?

750
00:53:32,561 --> 00:53:34,479
I'll walk in first. Wait five minutes.

751
00:53:35,564 --> 00:53:36,565
Why?

752
00:53:38,149 --> 00:53:40,986
- Why?
- It'll look strange to walk in together.

753
00:53:41,069 --> 00:53:43,363
It's okay for two men to sleep together!

754
00:53:44,322 --> 00:53:45,282
- Hello.
- Hello.

755
00:53:45,365 --> 00:53:46,366
Hello.

756
00:53:58,378 --> 00:53:59,462
You're here early.

757
00:54:00,171 --> 00:54:01,631
- Mr. Gye.
- Yes?

758
00:54:01,715 --> 00:54:03,466
I got the analysis report from NFS.

759
00:54:04,301 --> 00:54:08,138
The drug from Hwadong Medical Center
and the drugs from Obongsan are a match.

760
00:54:10,265 --> 00:54:12,309
FENTANYL FOUND IN BOTH EVIDENCE 1 AND 2

761
00:54:12,392 --> 00:54:13,351
Request a warrant.

762
00:54:14,185 --> 00:54:15,020
Okay!

763
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,023
This should be enough
to get them this time, right?

764
00:54:19,232 --> 00:54:20,817
I haven't picked up boxes in a while.

765
00:54:22,027 --> 00:54:23,486
I'll need to use my strength.

766
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:38,543
"Ju Byeong-deok."

767
00:54:40,795 --> 00:54:42,380
Let's see.

768
00:54:56,561 --> 00:54:58,104
TO PROSECUTOR CHA JAE-SEONG

769
00:54:58,188 --> 00:55:01,733
THIS IS A TIP! THERE'S A SENIOR INTERN
WHO LIED ABOUT THEIR IDENTITY

770
00:55:24,547 --> 00:55:25,924
Who keeps sending these?

771
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:33,515
These ears are too big.

772
00:55:35,433 --> 00:55:36,893
This one doesn't have a scar.

773
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,484
Mi-jin.

774
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:48,780
- Mr. Gye.
- It's late.

775
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:51,950
Why are you here this late?

776
00:55:53,326 --> 00:55:54,411
What were you doing?

777
00:55:56,579 --> 00:55:58,248
Something urgent came up.

778
00:55:58,998 --> 00:56:00,542
Right, so what was so urgent?

779
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:03,628
It's a personal matter.

780
00:56:06,047 --> 00:56:07,507
What you do with Ko Won's a secret.

781
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:09,342
Your personal matters are secret.

782
00:56:09,926 --> 00:56:11,928
Why do you have so many secrets?

783
00:56:14,723 --> 00:56:17,892
You've been making me out
to be some strange person since last time.

784
00:56:19,227 --> 00:56:21,187
Did I do something wrong to you?

785
00:56:22,856 --> 00:56:24,691
No, you haven't.

786
00:56:24,774 --> 00:56:28,319
Then, is it a problem if I see Ko Won
over public or personal matters?

787
00:56:28,987 --> 00:56:30,572
No, it's not a problem but…

788
00:56:30,655 --> 00:56:33,366
Then, why are you here
interrogating me late at night?

789
00:56:34,868 --> 00:56:36,286
I'm not interrogating you.

790
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:40,623
I'm sorry if that's how you felt.

791
00:56:40,707 --> 00:56:42,250
But that wasn't my intention.

792
00:56:45,003 --> 00:56:46,212
Then, why did you come?

793
00:56:48,882 --> 00:56:49,799
Well…

794
00:56:51,426 --> 00:56:52,844
I met your friend.

795
00:56:53,887 --> 00:56:55,889
My friend? Ga-yeong?

796
00:56:55,972 --> 00:56:57,766
Whenever Mi-jin drinks,

797
00:56:57,849 --> 00:56:59,017
she turns into a puppy.

798
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:00,310
A puppy?

799
00:57:00,393 --> 00:57:02,437
Well… a dog.

800
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:03,772
Woof, woof! A dog.

801
00:57:03,855 --> 00:57:06,149
She'll grab onto anyone
and try to kiss them.

802
00:57:07,192 --> 00:57:09,027
She'll kiss anyone?

803
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:12,655
Just to make sure
there was no misunderstanding,

804
00:57:13,239 --> 00:57:15,283
I wanted to let you know.

805
00:57:18,536 --> 00:57:19,704
Was it because of that?

806
00:57:19,788 --> 00:57:21,372
Is that why you've avoided my calls?

807
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:27,170
- What?
- Nothing.

808
00:57:28,296 --> 00:57:29,547
There's no need for that.

809
00:57:32,217 --> 00:57:33,760
What do you mean?

810
00:57:33,843 --> 00:57:36,679
There's no misunderstanding,
so don't worry.

811
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,849
And not because
you don't want to misunderstand?

812
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,601
What does that mean?

813
00:57:41,684 --> 00:57:43,478
Do you know you're really strange?

814
00:57:43,561 --> 00:57:44,395
What?

815
00:57:44,479 --> 00:57:46,523
You show up late, ask strange questions,

816
00:57:46,606 --> 00:57:48,316
and tell me not to misunderstand

817
00:57:48,399 --> 00:57:49,818
despite giving mixed messages.

818
00:57:49,901 --> 00:57:52,487
Then, you apologize for no reason.
What's wrong with you?

819
00:57:53,488 --> 00:57:56,282
I think you're misunderstanding
what I'm saying right now.

820
00:57:56,366 --> 00:57:57,784
I'm not misunderstanding you!

821
00:58:00,495 --> 00:58:02,872
- That's not what I meant--
- I promise I won't.

822
00:58:02,956 --> 00:58:04,457
I know how you feel now,

823
00:58:04,541 --> 00:58:05,542
so you can go.

824
00:58:08,211 --> 00:58:09,504
But I'm not done…

825
00:58:10,296 --> 00:58:11,297
talking yet.

826
00:58:16,594 --> 00:58:17,554
What's with her?

827
00:58:27,063 --> 00:58:28,857
She knows how I feel about what?

828
00:58:44,455 --> 00:58:46,416
Why did he even come here?

829
00:58:48,084 --> 00:58:49,169
He denied everything.

830
00:58:50,587 --> 00:58:52,422
Misunderstanding?
What did I misunderstand?

831
00:58:54,549 --> 00:58:57,427
What am I supposed to do?

832
00:59:25,163 --> 00:59:27,957
He didn't have an umbrella when he left.

833
00:59:29,709 --> 00:59:31,127
Well, he has a car. He'll be fine.

834
00:59:31,211 --> 00:59:33,463
Yeah, because he's so good at everything.

835
00:59:33,546 --> 00:59:35,381
He can block the rain like this too.

836
00:59:58,404 --> 00:59:59,280
Hey!

837
01:00:00,823 --> 01:00:03,284
Why are you in the rain?
What's the matter?

838
01:00:04,118 --> 01:00:05,286
I was worried.

839
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:06,704
All of a sudden at this hour?

840
01:00:06,788 --> 01:00:08,957
Can't you just quit
from the prosecutors' office?

841
01:00:11,292 --> 01:00:13,586
Seriously, why are you
doing this to me too?

842
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:14,963
Did someone upset you?

843
01:00:15,046 --> 01:00:17,507
Forget it. Why are you here?
What did you want to tell me?

844
01:00:23,763 --> 01:00:25,014
Quit your public works job.

845
01:00:26,182 --> 01:00:28,101
If you need it, I'll pay your salary.

846
01:00:28,184 --> 01:00:29,102
Hey.

847
01:00:29,185 --> 01:00:31,396
You can help with my work
if you don't want it for free.

848
01:00:32,272 --> 01:00:35,108
I heard you already told Mr. Gye
that you worked with me.

849
01:00:35,733 --> 01:00:36,609
Just do that.

850
01:00:37,402 --> 01:00:38,778
What's with everyone today?

851
01:00:38,861 --> 01:00:41,990
It's like irritating me wasn't enough,
so you have to piss me off.

852
01:00:43,449 --> 01:00:45,576
Go brag about your money somewhere else.

853
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:47,996
I'm too busy trying
to make a living to care at all.

854
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:49,747
No, that's not what I meant.

855
01:00:49,831 --> 01:00:51,582
I looked pathetic,
so are you pitying me?

856
01:00:52,917 --> 01:00:54,085
Am I a charity case?

857
01:00:55,336 --> 01:00:56,170
Pity?

858
01:01:01,342 --> 01:01:02,176
How could I?

859
01:01:03,428 --> 01:01:05,179
You think life's easier with money?

860
01:01:06,055 --> 01:01:09,100
Then, why do I take so many meds
from my psychiatrist and sleeping pills

861
01:01:09,183 --> 01:01:10,518
to go to bed every night?

862
01:01:11,686 --> 01:01:13,187
So why are you doing this?

863
01:01:13,271 --> 01:01:14,314
I don't know!

864
01:01:14,939 --> 01:01:16,774
It's my first time, so I don't know.

865
01:01:18,568 --> 01:01:20,069
I just really like someone,

866
01:01:20,153 --> 01:01:23,114
but I'm worried to death
that something might happen to her.

867
01:01:23,197 --> 01:01:24,407
I'm restless.

868
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:26,159
I can't get anything done all day.

869
01:01:27,201 --> 01:01:30,038
I'm so preoccupied
that I even forget to take my pills.

870
01:01:30,747 --> 01:01:32,040
I've never felt this way before.

871
01:01:46,888 --> 01:01:47,972
About who?

872
01:01:51,392 --> 01:01:52,268
You.

873
01:02:48,908 --> 01:02:51,828
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

874
01:02:51,911 --> 01:02:54,539
<i>Mr. Gye called in sick today.</i>

875
01:02:54,622 --> 01:02:55,623
He's sick?

876
01:02:56,207 --> 01:02:59,752
<i>All the food
from the refrigerator is gone!</i>

877
01:02:59,836 --> 01:03:01,712
<i>He looked just like Ko Won.</i>

878
01:03:01,796 --> 01:03:02,630
Like who?

879
01:03:03,589 --> 01:03:04,674
Don't go.

880
01:03:06,426 --> 01:03:08,219
<i>We got the search warrant for Hwadong.</i>

881
01:03:10,304 --> 01:03:11,305
Fierce presence, my foot.

882
01:03:12,473 --> 01:03:14,016
Any pictures of them together?

883
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:16,436
<i>Lim Sun disappears
without a trace after work.</i>

884
01:03:16,519 --> 01:03:18,438
<i>We should check for ourselves.</i>

885
01:03:18,521 --> 01:03:20,606
<i>By any chance,
did something happen to Mi-jin?</i>

886
01:03:21,065 --> 01:03:22,275
<i>Lee Mi-jin!</i>
