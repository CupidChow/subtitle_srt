<i>Do you know you're really strange?</i>

8
00:00:22,797 --> 00:00:24,507
You show up late, ask strange questions,

9
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,592
and tell me not to misunderstand

10
00:00:26,676 --> 00:00:28,177
despite giving mixed messages.

11
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:31,556
Then, you apologize for no reason.
What's wrong with you?

12
00:00:31,639 --> 00:00:34,392
I think you're misunderstanding
what I'm saying right now.

13
00:00:34,475 --> 00:00:35,893
I'm not misunderstanding you!

14
00:00:35,977 --> 00:00:38,312
- That's not what I meant--
- I promise I won't.

15
00:00:38,396 --> 00:00:39,772
I know how you feel now,

16
00:00:39,856 --> 00:00:40,690
so you can go.

17
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:32,533
<i>Could you look up
the registration for this car?</i>

18
00:01:38,247 --> 00:01:39,791
I don't know!

19
00:01:39,874 --> 00:01:42,001
It's my first time, so I don't know.

20
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:44,670
I just really like someone,

21
00:01:44,754 --> 00:01:47,507
but I'm worried to death
that something might happen to her.

22
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,967
I'm restless.
I can't get anything done all day.

23
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:54,096
I'm so preoccupied
that I even forget to take my pills.

24
00:01:54,597 --> 00:01:55,932
I've never felt this way before.

25
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:06,442
About who?

26
00:02:09,403 --> 00:02:10,404
You.

27
00:02:33,803 --> 00:02:36,430
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

28
00:02:39,642 --> 00:02:41,686
PROSECUTOR GYE JI-UNG

29
00:02:48,943 --> 00:02:51,028
Mr. Gye called in sick today.

30
00:02:51,112 --> 00:02:52,280
He's sick?

31
00:02:52,363 --> 00:02:53,364
What does he have?

32
00:02:53,447 --> 00:02:55,199
How sick is he?

33
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:01,455
He doesn't miss a day of work
and comes in at the crack of dawn.

34
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:02,665
It's just surprising.

35
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:06,210
But it's not very serious, is it?

36
00:03:06,294 --> 00:03:10,172
Well, he usually takes care of himself,
but he's come down with a nasty cold.

37
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:11,924
<i>Let's not think about it.</i>

38
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:13,968
<i>He has nothing to do with me.</i>

39
00:03:15,177 --> 00:03:16,345
But I can't just rest.

40
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:17,805
Damn, it's so annoying.

41
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:18,890
Excuse me?

42
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:22,101
I was talking to myself.

43
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,896
It was about someone else
and not worrying about them.

44
00:03:26,397 --> 00:03:27,231
Who?

45
00:03:29,734 --> 00:03:32,445
Whether it's this guy or that,
don't worry about them.

46
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,367
Go! What are you doing?

47
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,621
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. The sun is so bright.

48
00:03:41,704 --> 00:03:43,331
We need some blinds.

49
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:46,083
<i>I know how that feels.</i>

50
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:48,711
You don't want to think about it,
but it bothers you.

51
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:51,047
The more you try not to think about it,
the more you do.

52
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,175
You feel restless and crazy all day.
You can't do anything.

53
00:03:57,386 --> 00:03:59,013
I know how that feels too.

54
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,600
Because that's how I feel right now.

55
00:04:06,854 --> 00:04:08,689
Even when I tell myself to stop, I can't.

56
00:04:09,523 --> 00:04:11,776
I know it won't happen,
but I can't help it.

57
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:15,696
I can't even control myself,
so how could I tell you to do the same?

58
00:04:47,853 --> 00:04:49,605
PHARMACY

59
00:04:50,606 --> 00:04:54,276
<i>He usually takes care of himself,
but he's come down with a nasty cold.</i>

60
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,488
What's wrong with me?
I said I wouldn't think about it.

61
00:04:58,489 --> 00:04:59,615
Just go.

62
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:01,993
Start pedaling.

63
00:05:03,953 --> 00:05:04,954
<i>There's no need for that.</i>

64
00:05:05,037 --> 00:05:08,124
There's no misunderstanding,
so don't worry.

65
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:12,086
And not because
you don't want to misunderstand?

66
00:05:14,672 --> 00:05:15,923
He doesn't deserve it.

67
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,300
Serves him right.

68
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:19,218
Jeez.

69
00:05:22,596 --> 00:05:23,597
Here you go.

70
00:05:23,681 --> 00:05:25,975
- Two pills after meals, right?
- Thank you.

71
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,144
Lee Ja-yeon? Okay.

72
00:05:30,271 --> 00:05:32,273
You have no pride, Mi-jin.

73
00:05:40,114 --> 00:05:42,616
Don't get off the bike.

74
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:47,288
Why did I get off?

75
00:05:47,371 --> 00:05:48,664
I don't like rice porridge.

76
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,667
Darn it.

77
00:05:59,467 --> 00:06:00,801
My goodness!

78
00:06:02,928 --> 00:06:04,221
Damn! That scared me!

79
00:06:04,305 --> 00:06:06,348
But why am I running away?

80
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,350
I didn't even do anything wrong.

81
00:06:09,643 --> 00:06:10,644
Damn it.

82
00:06:14,148 --> 00:06:18,736
You know, without Mr. Gye at the office,
it's so quiet and peaceful.

83
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:19,779
It feels so…

84
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:22,782
empty.

85
00:06:23,908 --> 00:06:25,284
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yes?

86
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:27,036
When someone who rarely gets sick

87
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:29,997
catches a nasty cold
and has to be in bed for days,

88
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,709
I'd like a porridge that will help him
bounce back, and make it to go, please.

89
00:06:37,046 --> 00:06:38,547
I'm home.

90
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:43,594
What's this smell?

91
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:47,098
Wow, it smells so good.

92
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:48,682
Mom, I'm home.

93
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:49,850
- Hey.
- Hi.

94
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:53,312
Wow, look how milky white
that ox knee soup is.

95
00:06:53,395 --> 00:06:55,231
Mom, is this the most premium grade?

96
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:56,148
Yeah.

97
00:06:56,232 --> 00:06:58,192
If someone was suffering from a cold,

98
00:06:58,776 --> 00:07:01,153
I bet a bowl of this
would cure them right away.

99
00:07:01,237 --> 00:07:02,738
What? Is someone sick?

100
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:06,075
No, I'm just saying.

101
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:07,618
- Ms. Lim.
- Yeah?

102
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:09,495
- Is it done?
- What was that?

103
00:07:09,578 --> 00:07:10,704
Are you "Ms. Lim" too?

104
00:07:11,956 --> 00:07:14,166
Well, Mom's busy,
so I just answered for her.

105
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,127
- Our girl's so sweet.
- Yeah.

106
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,670
Wash your hands for dinner.

107
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:21,298
It's been so long since you made
something this nourishing.

108
00:07:21,382 --> 00:07:23,050
I better wash up fast and dig in.

109
00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:31,744
That's all of it.

110
00:08:46,675 --> 00:08:48,302
- Hey.
<i>- Did you give it to him?</i>

111
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:49,929
No, not yet.

112
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,223
Should I just leave it here?

113
00:08:52,306 --> 00:08:55,059
<i>I said just go in and give it to him.</i>

114
00:08:55,142 --> 00:08:56,769
<i>- You're so frustrating.</i>
- Go in?

115
00:08:56,852 --> 00:08:58,604
I'm on my way out, so I'll come down.

116
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:01,857
What in the world?

117
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:02,900
Hey.

118
00:09:02,983 --> 00:09:04,985
My contact lens fell out.

119
00:09:05,069 --> 00:09:06,695
Why would I go inside?

120
00:09:12,576 --> 00:09:13,410
Ms. Lee Mi-jin?

121
00:09:14,036 --> 00:09:15,496
- Hello.
- Hello.

122
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:18,415
I was dropping by because Mr. Gye's sick.

123
00:09:18,499 --> 00:09:20,584
- I see.
- Wow, I'm cluelessly interrupting!

124
00:09:20,668 --> 00:09:22,670
I only dropped by
on the way to my friend's house.

125
00:09:22,753 --> 00:09:23,837
I was about to go up.

126
00:09:23,921 --> 00:09:24,964
I'm sure you were.

127
00:09:25,047 --> 00:09:26,340
Enjoy your visit.

128
00:09:26,423 --> 00:09:27,258
Wait a moment.

129
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:30,010
No, wait…

130
00:09:30,094 --> 00:09:31,220
Give him this for me.

131
00:09:31,303 --> 00:09:32,972
Did you make all those yourself?

132
00:09:33,055 --> 00:09:34,848
- I did, but--
- What's that?

133
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:37,601
This is ox knee soup.
Can you give this to him…

134
00:09:41,855 --> 00:09:42,940
What brings you here?

135
00:09:43,565 --> 00:09:44,942
I didn't press the bell.

136
00:09:46,568 --> 00:09:47,528
Are you okay?

137
00:09:48,028 --> 00:09:48,988
Go in…

138
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:50,489
Let's go inside.

139
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,499
<i>Wow. He's got good sense.</i>

140
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:07,464
DOGAVILL STUDIO APARTMENT

141
00:10:45,127 --> 00:10:46,045
<i>He's so dazzling.</i>

142
00:10:51,425 --> 00:10:52,426
<i>Incredible.</i>

143
00:10:54,595 --> 00:10:55,804
Gosh, it's cold.

144
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,598
Now, where should I go tonight?

145
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:01,643
Wow.

146
00:11:02,352 --> 00:11:03,353
He's so cool.

147
00:11:08,609 --> 00:11:09,443
What?

148
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,449
What is this?

149
00:11:23,207 --> 00:11:24,958
You haven't eaten anything?

150
00:11:27,711 --> 00:11:29,421
I took medicine, so I'll be fine.

151
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:33,092
You can't take medicine
on an empty stomach.

152
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,802
It's fine.

153
00:11:49,024 --> 00:11:50,109
I should reheat this.

154
00:11:54,238 --> 00:11:55,405
Hot.

155
00:11:56,448 --> 00:11:57,324
That's hot.

156
00:12:32,401 --> 00:12:33,402
Here.

157
00:12:36,947 --> 00:12:38,157
Is that for me?

158
00:12:45,747 --> 00:12:47,457
<i>I guess you like it.</i>

159
00:13:11,106 --> 00:13:12,107
What's this?

160
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,906
Where did all the side dishes go?

161
00:13:25,537 --> 00:13:27,664
Honey!

162
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:29,458
Come out here!

163
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,835
What? What is it?

164
00:13:33,545 --> 00:13:36,006
- What?
- That crazy lady must've been here again!

165
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:37,549
What?!

166
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:38,842
I don't believe this!

167
00:13:38,926 --> 00:13:41,595
Where is she? Where?

168
00:13:41,678 --> 00:13:44,514
All the food
from the refrigerator is gone!

169
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,019
- No, it wasn't her.
- What do you mean?

170
00:13:49,102 --> 00:13:51,897
She even stole every drop of soup I made!

171
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,774
It went to our future son-in-law.

172
00:13:54,691 --> 00:13:55,692
What did you say?

173
00:14:27,724 --> 00:14:30,102
I prepared your meal,
so make sure you eat.

174
00:14:44,908 --> 00:14:45,909
Don't go.

175
00:15:26,617 --> 00:15:27,826
My mom…

176
00:15:29,703 --> 00:15:31,163
said she'd come back.

177
00:15:52,684 --> 00:15:55,062
- Mom?
- Hey, you were still awake?

178
00:15:55,145 --> 00:15:56,688
Yeah, I was waiting for you.

179
00:15:56,772 --> 00:15:59,191
I told you I'd be late tonight.
Go to bed now.

180
00:15:59,274 --> 00:16:01,735
They said the first snow
of the season's falling tonight.

181
00:16:01,818 --> 00:16:03,612
<i>No wonder it's been so cold.</i>

182
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,614
How about we make a snowman?

183
00:16:05,697 --> 00:16:06,698
Really?

184
00:16:07,449 --> 00:16:08,533
Really.

185
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:10,410
You really promise?

186
00:16:10,494 --> 00:16:11,828
<i>I really promise.</i>

187
00:16:11,912 --> 00:16:13,288
I'll be home soon.

188
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,082
- Hurry home.
<i>- Go to bed now.</i>

189
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:16,541
<i>Okay.</i>

190
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:19,086
That was the last time.

191
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:25,509
That promise my mom made with me

192
00:16:26,843 --> 00:16:28,804
was the first and last one.

193
00:16:33,517 --> 00:16:35,477
Why was it the last one?

194
00:16:38,021 --> 00:16:39,356
She disappeared.

195
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,696
Everyone told me she died.

196
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,909
Or they said she ran away.

197
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:54,705
Maybe I wanted to believe it.

198
00:16:57,207 --> 00:16:59,209
I didn't want that promise to be a lie.

199
00:17:04,131 --> 00:17:07,509
That's why I came here to Seohan.

200
00:17:41,501 --> 00:17:42,627
So cool.

201
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:53,221
What in the world was that?

202
00:17:57,768 --> 00:17:58,643
You're still up?

203
00:18:01,563 --> 00:18:02,981
What? What's wrong?

204
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:08,361
Who was that person
who helped you downstairs earlier?

205
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,739
The investigator?

206
00:18:10,822 --> 00:18:11,990
The investigator!

207
00:18:12,073 --> 00:18:14,242
So that's why he had
such a fierce presence.

208
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,245
- Had what?
- He looked just like Ko Won.

209
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:18,163
Like who?

210
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:24,252
By the way, what's going on
with you and Ko Won?

211
00:18:25,629 --> 00:18:27,047
Nothing's going on.

212
00:18:27,714 --> 00:18:28,924
If nothing's going on,

213
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:31,384
why would he help find the cat?
He always rebuffs girls.

214
00:18:32,803 --> 00:18:35,055
No way. Did Ko Won ask you--

215
00:18:35,138 --> 00:18:36,473
I saved his life.

216
00:18:36,556 --> 00:18:39,518
He's just helping me
look for the cat in order to repay me.

217
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:42,020
Nothing's going on. It never will.

218
00:18:42,103 --> 00:18:45,357
I thought you had something on him
and were exploiting him.

219
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,400
But is something the matter with him?

220
00:18:47,484 --> 00:18:48,985
He's so depressed right now.

221
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:50,111
It's like he was dumped.

222
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:52,197
Come on! He wasn't dumped!

223
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,246
I mean,

224
00:18:59,996 --> 00:19:02,499
there's no way a star like him
would be dumped.

225
00:19:07,587 --> 00:19:09,756
It's… ridiculous.

226
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,760
You've finally realized
just how precious Ko Won is.

227
00:19:14,511 --> 00:19:15,637
But no thanks.

228
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,473
Because just my love is enough for Ko Won.

229
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,934
Wow! He's so handsome.

230
00:19:21,935 --> 00:19:22,978
I'm going to bed.

231
00:19:24,354 --> 00:19:26,147
- I'm turning off the lights.
- Okay.

232
00:20:40,931 --> 00:20:43,558
<i>If Mr. Gye's mom disappeared…</i>

233
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,354
<i>If instead of running away,</i>

234
00:20:48,897 --> 00:20:50,857
<i>she really disappeared…</i>

235
00:20:57,572 --> 00:21:00,575
<i>does that mean Aunt Sun disappeared too?</i>

236
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:12,212
That tiny elf we met
at the pig's trotters place

237
00:21:12,295 --> 00:21:13,755
is the investigator?

238
00:21:13,838 --> 00:21:15,215
I told you.

239
00:21:15,298 --> 00:21:17,175
No way!

240
00:21:17,258 --> 00:21:18,885
But he looked just like Ko Won.

241
00:21:19,469 --> 00:21:21,262
That's how he looked in my eyes.

242
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:24,683
You didn't wear your contacts, did you?

243
00:21:24,766 --> 00:21:25,600
No, they fell out.

244
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,644
Always wear them.
You're asking for trouble.

245
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,772
My Ko Won!

246
00:21:31,648 --> 00:21:33,400
My gosh, I don't believe this!

247
00:21:33,942 --> 00:21:35,318
- No way!
- Bye.

248
00:21:36,111 --> 00:21:37,487
This can't be true.

249
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,698
That little elf's really Ko Won? Damn it!

250
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,744
This is ridiculous!
How could he be Ko Won?

251
00:21:44,828 --> 00:21:46,329
My Ko Won!

252
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:50,542
<i>Come in.</i>

253
00:22:03,471 --> 00:22:05,640
You work on the fourth floor.
Why are you always here?

254
00:22:07,642 --> 00:22:08,977
It's uncomfortable for us.

255
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:30,874
Yes, I'll bring down
the files you mentioned.

256
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,625
Okay.

257
00:22:42,844 --> 00:22:44,220
Did you know too, Mr. Gye?

258
00:22:44,721 --> 00:22:45,555
Know what?

259
00:22:46,389 --> 00:22:47,307
About Ko Won.

260
00:22:47,891 --> 00:22:48,975
I thought you knew.

261
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:51,186
Know what about him?

262
00:22:52,979 --> 00:22:54,314
About the person he likes.

263
00:23:01,362 --> 00:23:02,614
So you did know.

264
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:08,203
The feelings are mutual,
so how can you stop them, right?

265
00:23:09,078 --> 00:23:10,246
They're mutual?

266
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:15,418
Yes, I thought it was one-sided at first,
but it seems to have become mutual.

267
00:23:15,502 --> 00:23:16,795
- It's sweet.
- Drink.

268
00:23:16,878 --> 00:23:18,421
So make sure to take them.

269
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:25,762
Come on.

270
00:23:26,513 --> 00:23:27,722
- Hey.
- Let's go.

271
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:28,848
- Wait.
- Come on, let's go.

272
00:23:28,932 --> 00:23:30,767
- Ms. Lim.
- What's with you?

273
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,227
See? I knew you'd get in.

274
00:23:33,061 --> 00:23:34,604
Watch your head.

275
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,485
I don't know!

276
00:23:40,568 --> 00:23:42,695
It's my first time, so I don't know.

277
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:45,698
I'm so preoccupied
that I even forget to take my pills.

278
00:23:46,282 --> 00:23:47,575
I've never felt this way before.

279
00:23:56,209 --> 00:23:57,293
Are you okay?

280
00:23:57,377 --> 00:23:59,295
She's really dating Ko Won?

281
00:23:59,963 --> 00:24:00,797
At first,

282
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,758
I didn't think it was right either.

283
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,136
But I'll support them now.

284
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,097
Why would you support them?

285
00:24:10,056 --> 00:24:11,683
To be frank, love isn't a crime.

286
00:24:18,606 --> 00:24:20,525
What about the vehicle
I asked you to look up?

287
00:24:20,608 --> 00:24:22,986
I checked. It's an unregistered vehicle.

288
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:25,405
Why are you telling me this just now?

289
00:24:25,488 --> 00:24:27,448
You should've told me right away!

290
00:24:28,032 --> 00:24:29,617
Do I always have to ask first?

291
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,328
What do you do all day?

292
00:24:32,912 --> 00:24:33,997
Jeez!

293
00:24:38,793 --> 00:24:39,961
Yeah, at first…

294
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,006
I'm sure it'll be hard to accept.

295
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:44,507
Yeah, I understand.

296
00:24:44,591 --> 00:24:46,843
I was like that too.

297
00:24:52,974 --> 00:24:55,768
Hello, Detective Kwon?
Where's Baek Cheol-gyu right now?

298
00:24:56,352 --> 00:24:57,478
Hello, Mr. Gye.

299
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:59,939
He's hiding in the hospital
and hasn't come out.

300
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:02,108
Are you sure he's inside?

301
00:25:02,191 --> 00:25:04,444
I'm sure he's roaming around
somewhere inside.

302
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,071
Does he even go home?

303
00:25:07,655 --> 00:25:09,073
He hasn't gone anywhere.

304
00:25:10,366 --> 00:25:12,076
I'm sure he's inside the hospital.

305
00:25:13,494 --> 00:25:15,872
Okay, keep an eye on him.

306
00:25:22,879 --> 00:25:27,300
Yeah, the car with plate number
ending in 2953 drove off.

307
00:25:27,383 --> 00:25:29,260
What should I do? Should I stay here?

308
00:25:29,802 --> 00:25:30,637
Okay.

309
00:25:34,974 --> 00:25:36,309
What's this?

310
00:25:40,563 --> 00:25:44,692
Why is Gye poking his nose
in everywhere? Damn it.

311
00:25:46,986 --> 00:25:48,363
Hello. Thanks for your hard work.

312
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:49,280
Yeah.

313
00:25:49,364 --> 00:25:51,783
- Is the dashcam on this car on?
- Yeah.

314
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,412
When did the black van parked here
with plate number 2953 leave?

315
00:25:56,496 --> 00:25:58,748
It left about an hour ago.

316
00:25:58,831 --> 00:25:59,874
An hour ago?

317
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:05,213
Look, I'm only doing this
because Detective Kwon begged me to,

318
00:26:05,296 --> 00:26:07,715
but it's not like I'm on night watch duty.

319
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,009
Will the culprit even show up
if I stay here?

320
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,387
I know it's difficult,

321
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,055
but this is very important.

322
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:15,640
I'd appreciate your help.

323
00:26:23,147 --> 00:26:25,775
Why is he suddenly being so respectful?

324
00:26:32,448 --> 00:26:34,367
What's the problem here?

325
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:38,037
It just comes and goes.

326
00:26:38,621 --> 00:26:39,580
Jeez.

327
00:27:09,235 --> 00:27:11,320
Lim Sun's place of residence is Dogavill.

328
00:27:12,113 --> 00:27:13,448
But take a look.

329
00:27:33,217 --> 00:27:37,138
<i>Instead of going home,
she went to a different house.</i>

330
00:27:40,141 --> 00:27:43,770
<i>After following her for a few days,
I found that she went to that house often.</i>

331
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,737
<i>But the strange thing is…</i>

332
00:27:59,327 --> 00:28:01,370
<i>whenever I'd lose sight of Lim Sun,</i>

333
00:28:01,454 --> 00:28:03,539
<i>a young woman would appear.</i>

334
00:28:03,623 --> 00:28:04,457
I'm home.

335
00:28:08,795 --> 00:28:09,796
<i>I looked into it.</i>

336
00:28:09,879 --> 00:28:12,715
<i>It turns out the house belongs
to Lim Sun's older sister.</i>

337
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,551
<i>And the young woman is Lim Sun's niece.</i>

338
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:36,322
As you can see,

339
00:28:36,406 --> 00:28:38,533
she meets with her niece behind the house.

340
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,034
I don't know why.

341
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:42,120
But they don't go in together.

342
00:28:42,662 --> 00:28:44,831
What do they do when they meet?

343
00:28:45,415 --> 00:28:46,874
I haven't found that out yet.

344
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:49,085
They move so quickly.

345
00:28:49,168 --> 00:28:51,003
Any pictures of them together?

346
00:28:51,087 --> 00:28:51,963
None.

347
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:54,006
They move separately.

348
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:57,218
Lim Sun disappears
without a trace after work,

349
00:28:57,301 --> 00:28:59,971
and Lee Mi-jin only moves
after Lim Sun gets off work.

350
00:29:01,514 --> 00:29:04,434
I'm sure the two of them
are up to something.

351
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,313
Here's information on her niece.

352
00:29:11,065 --> 00:29:13,943
RÉSUMÉ
LEE MI-JIN

353
00:29:14,026 --> 00:29:17,947
Are you sure Lim Sun
is that the same woman from 24 years ago?

354
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,452
We should check for ourselves.

355
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:31,043
<i>Season the bean sprouts well</i>

356
00:29:32,879 --> 00:29:34,839
Hey, by the way…

357
00:29:35,465 --> 00:29:36,382
What?

358
00:29:37,633 --> 00:29:40,636
I mean, well…

359
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,263
What is it?

360
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:44,557
Look at these bean sprouts!

361
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,851
They're nice and firm.

362
00:29:46,934 --> 00:29:48,019
How nice.

363
00:29:54,734 --> 00:29:55,568
What?

364
00:29:56,402 --> 00:29:57,820
Madame Kwak.

365
00:29:58,446 --> 00:30:00,323
Did you hear she's selling her shop?

366
00:30:00,406 --> 00:30:02,074
Have you lost it?

367
00:30:02,158 --> 00:30:04,660
Why would you suddenly bring that up?

368
00:30:04,744 --> 00:30:05,745
Be quiet!

369
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,790
I mean, I just thought
you'd be worried about it.

370
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,751
- Stop!
- I barely managed to find out.

371
00:30:11,834 --> 00:30:14,378
Forget it then! Jeez, you're unbelievable.

372
00:30:14,462 --> 00:30:17,965
Absolutely ridiculous.
I did it for you and you chew me out.

373
00:30:21,552 --> 00:30:23,763
Where was her shop?

374
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:27,266
At the intersection of--

375
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,392
You scared me!

376
00:30:28,476 --> 00:30:30,478
Gosh!

377
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:34,732
When did you get back, Cheong? Goodness.

378
00:30:34,815 --> 00:30:35,900
I was just…

379
00:30:35,983 --> 00:30:38,069
We weren't talking about anything.
We just--

380
00:30:38,152 --> 00:30:39,111
Shut up!

381
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,324
We did nothing wrong!
Why are you making excuses?

382
00:30:43,991 --> 00:30:44,909
Yeah!

383
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,662
Yeah, that's right.
There's no need to make excuses.

384
00:30:48,579 --> 00:30:49,455
Wow.

385
00:30:51,207 --> 00:30:53,501
Goodness. Why would you
roll up your sleeves?

386
00:30:53,584 --> 00:30:54,585
It's so chilly.

387
00:30:55,211 --> 00:30:56,128
Don't do this.

388
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:57,588
Use your words.

389
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,644
RECENTS
DOCUMENTS

390
00:31:12,979 --> 00:31:14,730
<i>Should I ask her to come out?</i>

391
00:31:18,734 --> 00:31:20,278
That hurts!

392
00:31:21,612 --> 00:31:25,199
- I have plans. I should go.
- Right.

393
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:26,701
Where do you think you're going?

394
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:29,120
- Where are you going?
- What's going on?

395
00:31:29,203 --> 00:31:30,204
I'll teach you to…

396
00:31:33,916 --> 00:31:35,418
Goodness.

397
00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:37,878
What brings you here, Mr. Gye?

398
00:31:38,713 --> 00:31:40,965
Well, I came in because I heard screams.

399
00:31:41,048 --> 00:31:42,300
I'll be on my way.

400
00:31:42,383 --> 00:31:43,759
- Don't go!
- Don't go!

401
00:31:45,386 --> 00:31:46,637
You seem very busy, so--

402
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:49,890
- No! Come in.
- No! Please come inside!

403
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:51,183
Come on in.

404
00:31:51,267 --> 00:31:52,685
This is what we do for fun.

405
00:31:53,894 --> 00:31:56,856
Honey, shall we clean up now?
You help too, Pyeon-gang.

406
00:32:01,694 --> 00:32:04,697
Goodness, I can't believe
I finally get a chance

407
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,533
to serve you
my precious homemade quince tea.

408
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:08,993
Thank you.

409
00:32:10,453 --> 00:32:13,122
We should share
this precious tea with everyone.

410
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:21,297
It's all yours.

411
00:32:22,632 --> 00:32:25,051
- Please have some.
- Okay, thank you.

412
00:32:26,218 --> 00:32:28,179
Thank you.

413
00:32:30,931 --> 00:32:33,559
Goodness, thank you.

414
00:32:38,648 --> 00:32:41,108
By the way, how do you two
know each other?

415
00:32:42,234 --> 00:32:44,028
I'm one of his tenants.

416
00:32:44,528 --> 00:32:45,404
A tenant?

417
00:32:46,155 --> 00:32:48,032
I see. For which place?

418
00:32:51,077 --> 00:32:53,663
You know, the one over there…

419
00:32:53,746 --> 00:32:54,914
What did you say?

420
00:32:55,498 --> 00:32:56,832
So which place?

421
00:32:58,042 --> 00:32:59,085
Dogavill.

422
00:32:59,168 --> 00:33:00,127
I see.

423
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:03,089
Where Ga-yeong lives?
There must've been an empty unit.

424
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:06,509
Tell her the truth.

425
00:33:09,428 --> 00:33:10,471
Apartment 303…

426
00:33:10,554 --> 00:33:11,514
Where?

427
00:33:12,264 --> 00:33:16,143
Apartment 303.

428
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:17,812
Are you crazy? That haunted…

429
00:33:20,022 --> 00:33:23,025
How could you put that unit up for rent?

430
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:28,322
I mean, I was going to
give him a discount.

431
00:33:29,949 --> 00:33:31,117
Starting this month,

432
00:33:32,201 --> 00:33:33,869
just pay half the rent.

433
00:33:34,537 --> 00:33:35,371
All of a sudden?

434
00:33:35,454 --> 00:33:36,497
Yeah.

435
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:42,086
I wanted to be a really good landlord.

436
00:33:42,962 --> 00:33:43,796
All of a sudden.

437
00:33:52,471 --> 00:33:55,141
Hey, did something happen
to Director Baek?

438
00:33:55,224 --> 00:33:57,518
He hasn't come in to work for days now.

439
00:33:57,601 --> 00:33:59,061
He must be busy.

440
00:33:59,145 --> 00:34:01,313
Jeez, is that all you can say?

441
00:34:01,397 --> 00:34:03,357
He's a colleague. Aren't you worried?

442
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:05,735
He's my colleague too.

443
00:34:05,818 --> 00:34:08,195
I've already called him.

444
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:11,157
He won't pick up or text back.

445
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,784
Still, this isn't normal, right?

446
00:34:13,868 --> 00:34:15,745
Shouldn't we go by his place?

447
00:34:15,828 --> 00:34:20,332
Remember how we lost contact
with Ko Na-heun, and then…

448
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:23,169
And then, look what happened to him.

449
00:34:23,252 --> 00:34:24,587
Good grief.

450
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,589
You still think you're a detective?

451
00:34:27,214 --> 00:34:28,632
Director Baek is different.

452
00:34:28,716 --> 00:34:31,552
Unlike us, he has somewhere to go
if he quits this job.

453
00:34:31,635 --> 00:34:35,473
He used to be a director
of a hospital, so he's well-off.

454
00:34:35,556 --> 00:34:39,643
We knew he wouldn't stay long
as a senior public intern.

455
00:34:39,727 --> 00:34:40,978
I know that, but…

456
00:34:41,061 --> 00:34:43,147
I'd be out having fun too if I were rich.

457
00:34:44,732 --> 00:34:46,442
Just hurry up and clean.

458
00:34:49,069 --> 00:34:49,987
Gosh.

459
00:34:54,408 --> 00:34:55,534
What?

460
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,169
I'm home.

461
00:35:08,547 --> 00:35:09,381
Hey!

462
00:35:12,259 --> 00:35:13,469
Hello.

463
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,930
Mr. Gye.

464
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:17,473
I told you to stay seated.

465
00:35:17,556 --> 00:35:18,474
Yes, ma'am.

466
00:35:18,557 --> 00:35:20,059
- Hey.
- Hi.

467
00:35:23,103 --> 00:35:24,855
Go wash your hands. Dinner's ready.

468
00:35:26,273 --> 00:35:27,233
What's going on?

469
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:31,028
- I think it's your engagement dinner.
- I'll kill you.

470
00:35:31,654 --> 00:35:33,280
Why is there so much?

471
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:34,949
Dad, where should I put this?

472
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:36,283
- Here.
- Put it here.

473
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:37,993
- Ga-yeong.
- Yes, Mom?

474
00:35:38,077 --> 00:35:39,161
- Sit down.
- Yes, sir.

475
00:35:39,245 --> 00:35:40,246
Take a seat.

476
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:41,455
Sit.

477
00:35:42,456 --> 00:35:43,791
It's not time for alcohol yet.

478
00:35:43,874 --> 00:35:45,376
Do you like it mixed or straight?

479
00:35:47,461 --> 00:35:49,004
What in the world are they doing?

480
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:52,842
Mi-jin, don't you ever fix
your makeup at work?

481
00:35:52,925 --> 00:35:53,926
You try growing old.

482
00:35:54,009 --> 00:35:55,469
- Makeup is suffocating.
- Wait.

483
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,346
Look at these bags and your greasy skin.

484
00:35:57,429 --> 00:35:59,723
- Is it that bad?
- Yeah. Sit down for a second.

485
00:35:59,849 --> 00:36:02,852
I'll make it look natural. Lips.

486
00:36:02,935 --> 00:36:05,020
What if my parents
start saying weird things?

487
00:36:05,104 --> 00:36:06,564
Don't worry. I'll be your defense.

488
00:36:06,647 --> 00:36:07,731
- Okay.
- Lips.

489
00:36:07,815 --> 00:36:09,233
- Will they ask weird things?
- No.

490
00:36:09,316 --> 00:36:11,193
Even if they do, I have your back.

491
00:36:11,277 --> 00:36:13,112
- Okay.
- Don't worry. Wait!

492
00:36:13,195 --> 00:36:14,321
Your greasy face.

493
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:16,365
- Greasy face?
- Why are you so greasy?

494
00:36:16,448 --> 00:36:17,908
Smile. You'll get wrinkles.

495
00:36:17,992 --> 00:36:19,785
- I'll trust you.
- Yeah.

496
00:36:19,869 --> 00:36:21,453
- Seriously. I'm counting on you.
- Okay.

497
00:36:22,204 --> 00:36:23,038
Okay.

498
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:26,208
This is what we usually have for dinner.

499
00:36:26,292 --> 00:36:27,459
A simple meal.

500
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:30,754
Now, let's eat.

501
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:33,924
- Please enjoy! Thank you!
- Thank you for the meal!

502
00:36:34,008 --> 00:36:35,426
Mr. Gye, eat up.

503
00:36:35,509 --> 00:36:36,844
I will. Thank you.

504
00:36:36,927 --> 00:36:39,680
Ga-yeong, take some side dishes
with you when you go.

505
00:36:39,763 --> 00:36:42,266
Okay, Mom. Nice! I was out of kimchi too.

506
00:36:43,058 --> 00:36:44,852
That's right.

507
00:36:44,935 --> 00:36:49,732
I made some great ox knee soup yesterday.

508
00:36:49,815 --> 00:36:51,734
But someone ran off with it.

509
00:36:51,817 --> 00:36:53,694
Gosh, I should've given you that.

510
00:36:53,777 --> 00:36:55,237
What a waste.

511
00:36:59,992 --> 00:37:00,951
Are you okay?

512
00:37:02,745 --> 00:37:04,079
Eat slowly.

513
00:37:05,789 --> 00:37:07,750
All right. The <i>japchae's</i> good.

514
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:09,501
But is today a special day?

515
00:37:15,341 --> 00:37:17,092
Goodness, I almost forgot.

516
00:37:17,176 --> 00:37:18,761
I need to bring the yellow corvina.

517
00:37:18,844 --> 00:37:20,304
Keep eating.

518
00:37:23,265 --> 00:37:24,516
What? What's the matter?

519
00:37:26,185 --> 00:37:28,896
It's your aunt's birthday today.

520
00:37:32,399 --> 00:37:34,735
Then, should we wait
until she gets here before we eat?

521
00:37:38,197 --> 00:37:40,115
Actually, my wife's--

522
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:41,867
Mr. Lee, here.

523
00:37:41,951 --> 00:37:43,035
Have a drink.

524
00:37:43,118 --> 00:37:45,204
- Let me pour it for you.
- Should I?

525
00:37:45,287 --> 00:37:46,538
How's work, Ga-yeong?

526
00:37:46,622 --> 00:37:47,498
Yes, of course.

527
00:37:47,581 --> 00:37:49,416
I got 50,000 more subscribers.

528
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,419
I don't know what that means,
but it sounds good.

529
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:54,046
Subscribers for my channel.

530
00:37:54,129 --> 00:37:55,965
I create beauty videos.

531
00:37:56,048 --> 00:37:56,882
Right.

532
00:37:58,676 --> 00:37:59,593
Actually, my wife's--

533
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:01,887
- Mr. Lee!
- What?

534
00:38:01,971 --> 00:38:03,514
I think you've had too many drinks.

535
00:38:03,597 --> 00:38:05,891
- I only had one shot.
- It must be the fine dust.

536
00:38:05,975 --> 00:38:07,810
But why is your face so red?

537
00:38:07,893 --> 00:38:09,103
- Am I red already?
- Yeah.

538
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:10,521
But I usually drink two bottles.

539
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:13,691
That's right. It was two bottles.

540
00:38:13,774 --> 00:38:17,528
That's why I secretly brought
some imported liquor for you.

541
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:18,988
What imported liquor?

542
00:38:19,071 --> 00:38:21,615
It's from a sponsorship. Don't tell Mom.

543
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:22,783
Come here, Mr. Lee.

544
00:38:22,866 --> 00:38:23,742
- Hurry.
- Really?

545
00:38:23,826 --> 00:38:25,077
- Yeah.
- What about me?

546
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,245
I'll give you some later.

547
00:38:26,328 --> 00:38:27,621
- What about me?
- Just wait, Dad.

548
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:28,706
Mr. Lee, come on.

549
00:38:48,851 --> 00:38:49,935
Mom, are you okay?

550
00:38:52,104 --> 00:38:53,897
It's nothing. I'm fine.

551
00:38:55,357 --> 00:38:56,567
It's already been years.

552
00:39:00,195 --> 00:39:01,363
I'm sorry I forgot.

553
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:06,869
These yellow corvina were Sun's favorite,

554
00:39:06,952 --> 00:39:09,163
and I was never able to make this for her.

555
00:39:14,084 --> 00:39:15,085
She'll come back.

556
00:39:17,087 --> 00:39:18,130
I know she will.

557
00:39:24,344 --> 00:39:25,345
I'm sorry.

558
00:39:33,258 --> 00:39:35,844
Goodness.

559
00:39:36,428 --> 00:39:37,596
Let's get back to eating.

560
00:39:38,263 --> 00:39:40,140
To tell you the truth,

561
00:39:40,223 --> 00:39:42,559
this family has a heart-wrenching story--

562
00:39:42,642 --> 00:39:44,686
- Dad!
- My goodness!

563
00:39:45,312 --> 00:39:46,313
What?

564
00:39:46,396 --> 00:39:47,731
You're drunk.

565
00:39:47,814 --> 00:39:49,274
You've had too much to drink.

566
00:39:50,192 --> 00:39:52,319
I didn't even have
one drink yet, you brat.

567
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,614
Then, instead of soju,

568
00:39:55,697 --> 00:39:57,115
let's drink something expensive.

569
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:59,659
I have an expensive bottle
of liquor just for you.

570
00:39:59,743 --> 00:40:01,328
- I'll give that to you.
- Liquor?

571
00:40:01,411 --> 00:40:03,330
- Get up!
- Liquor all of a sudden?

572
00:40:03,413 --> 00:40:04,539
I'll give you some! Come on.

573
00:40:04,623 --> 00:40:05,790
Where are we going?

574
00:40:05,874 --> 00:40:07,459
Should we go home? Come here.

575
00:40:07,542 --> 00:40:08,543
- Go home?
- Yeah.

576
00:40:08,627 --> 00:40:11,630
- I'll give it to you at home.
- We can't leave all that food here. Hey!

577
00:40:15,884 --> 00:40:18,762
I didn't come for this though.
She gave me so much again.

578
00:40:19,554 --> 00:40:21,431
How did you get dragged into this?

579
00:40:22,349 --> 00:40:25,060
- I didn't. I walked in on my own.
- To see me?

580
00:40:25,143 --> 00:40:27,270
Well, it's just…

581
00:40:27,354 --> 00:40:30,815
I was just passing by,
and it happened by coincidence.

582
00:40:30,899 --> 00:40:33,276
So you just happened to pass by here?

583
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:39,950
To be honest,
it's my aunt's birthday today.

584
00:40:40,533 --> 00:40:42,702
The aunt you resemble?

585
00:40:42,786 --> 00:40:43,620
Yes.

586
00:40:44,663 --> 00:40:45,872
She's not here,

587
00:40:46,373 --> 00:40:48,250
but we always celebrate her birthday.

588
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:49,668
She doesn't have a date of death.

589
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:51,336
If she doesn't have a…

590
00:40:53,046 --> 00:40:53,880
I see.

591
00:40:54,673 --> 00:40:55,548
Yes.

592
00:40:58,134 --> 00:41:02,347
Hearing about your mother
reminded me of my aunt a lot.

593
00:41:04,182 --> 00:41:08,395
I think maybe my mom feels the same…

594
00:41:10,605 --> 00:41:13,733
and can't bring herself
to say goodbye to my aunt.

595
00:41:14,609 --> 00:41:17,445
She has a sense of hope
that she might come back.

596
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,114
That's why.

597
00:41:33,086 --> 00:41:34,921
There's something I didn't tell you.

598
00:41:39,843 --> 00:41:41,553
- Yes?
- I have something to ask you.

599
00:41:43,013 --> 00:41:45,015
Since you're a prosecutor,

600
00:41:45,598 --> 00:41:46,975
I figured you'd know.

601
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:53,857
SEOHAN PROVINCIAL POLICE AGENCY
SUSPECT TO BE PROSECUTED FOR FRAUD

602
00:41:56,943 --> 00:41:59,362
I don't think I should be
telling you about this.

603
00:42:00,196 --> 00:42:01,448
So you do know about it.

604
00:42:13,251 --> 00:42:14,878
It's all my fault.

605
00:42:14,961 --> 00:42:17,130
She was born to an incompetent dad.

606
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,799
Her mom pressured her

607
00:42:19,883 --> 00:42:22,093
to get a civil service job
that doesn't even suit her,

608
00:42:22,177 --> 00:42:23,511
and she suffered so much.

609
00:42:25,889 --> 00:42:27,432
I just feel sorry for Mi-jin.

610
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:48,703
No.

611
00:42:49,287 --> 00:42:51,164
You didn't do anything wrong.

612
00:42:51,247 --> 00:42:52,332
It's all my fault.

613
00:43:11,726 --> 00:43:12,685
Hey.

614
00:43:12,769 --> 00:43:13,937
Did you see him out?

615
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,230
What are you doing, Dad?

616
00:43:15,313 --> 00:43:17,107
I was just bored.

617
00:43:18,191 --> 00:43:20,276
Have you been shining my shoes every day?

618
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:23,029
Just every now and then.

619
00:43:23,113 --> 00:43:24,197
Goodness.

620
00:43:44,092 --> 00:43:44,926
Yeah?

621
00:43:45,009 --> 00:43:46,386
Can I come in?

622
00:43:46,469 --> 00:43:47,303
Yeah.

623
00:43:49,764 --> 00:43:50,890
Were you going to bed?

624
00:43:50,974 --> 00:43:51,933
No, not yet.

625
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:05,947
It's some money I had saved up.

626
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:07,198
What is this?

627
00:44:07,282 --> 00:44:10,160
I wanted to buy you an outfit
when you got a job.

628
00:44:10,243 --> 00:44:11,536
Just use it however you like.

629
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:12,662
Dad, it's fine…

630
00:44:13,329 --> 00:44:15,540
I can afford this much, okay?

631
00:44:16,291 --> 00:44:17,292
Take it.

632
00:44:17,375 --> 00:44:18,418
Don't tell your mom.

633
00:44:19,461 --> 00:44:20,587
Today was hard, right?

634
00:44:21,212 --> 00:44:22,297
No, I'm fine.

635
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:23,673
- Get some rest.
- Okay.

636
00:44:26,009 --> 00:44:27,552
- Mi-jin.
- Yeah?

637
00:44:27,635 --> 00:44:28,887
You're doing great.

638
00:44:42,025 --> 00:44:44,027
FROM DAD

639
00:45:27,195 --> 00:45:29,489
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

640
00:45:31,241 --> 00:45:32,158
- Ms. Lim.
- Yes?

641
00:45:32,242 --> 00:45:33,993
We got the search warrant for Hwadong.

642
00:45:34,118 --> 00:45:35,119
What?

643
00:45:35,203 --> 00:45:36,663
Let's go get Hwadong Medical Center.

644
00:45:36,746 --> 00:45:37,664
Yes, sir.

645
00:46:25,586 --> 00:46:28,339
Everyone, stop what you're doing.
We ask for your cooperation.

646
00:46:29,424 --> 00:46:31,092
Hey! Stop!

647
00:46:31,676 --> 00:46:33,136
We're from the prosecutors' office.

648
00:46:35,054 --> 00:46:36,222
From this moment on,

649
00:46:36,306 --> 00:46:38,224
we will conduct the search and seizure

650
00:46:38,308 --> 00:46:39,350
of Hwadong Medical Center.

651
00:46:39,434 --> 00:46:40,727
Everyone, freeze!

652
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:42,228
Nobody move!

653
00:46:42,312 --> 00:46:44,897
Please put everything
on their desks into the boxes.

654
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:55,658
Hwadong Medical Center?

655
00:46:55,742 --> 00:47:00,038
Didn't Baek Cheol-gyu used to be
the director of that hospital?

656
00:47:00,121 --> 00:47:01,664
Why would they search there?

657
00:47:02,749 --> 00:47:05,585
It might not be an issue
with Director Baek.

658
00:47:05,668 --> 00:47:07,170
Then, is it an internal issue?

659
00:47:07,253 --> 00:47:10,506
Ask Lim Sun if you're that curious.

660
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:13,217
It looked like she went along
to help with the boxes.

661
00:47:14,761 --> 00:47:15,595
I knew it.

662
00:47:15,678 --> 00:47:18,848
She gets to work on serious cases
as an office assistant.

663
00:47:19,432 --> 00:47:23,227
Some get to carry seized boxes,
and others get to carry mops.

664
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:28,775
Jeez. At your age, you should be grateful
for the chance to even hold a mop.

665
00:47:28,858 --> 00:47:30,318
What are you grumbling about?

666
00:47:30,401 --> 00:47:32,987
Give it here if you don't want to work.

667
00:47:33,071 --> 00:47:36,366
There are plenty of others out there
who are willing to work.

668
00:47:36,449 --> 00:47:37,658
Who says I didn't want to?

669
00:47:43,247 --> 00:47:44,248
Wait.

670
00:47:44,832 --> 00:47:47,502
It couldn't be related
to Ko Na-heun's case, could it?

671
00:47:48,294 --> 00:47:49,921
Who knows?

672
00:47:50,004 --> 00:47:53,341
It's not like the lunatic has a sign
on their face saying they're crazy.

673
00:47:55,343 --> 00:47:59,347
Once in a while,
those who you'd least expect

674
00:47:59,972 --> 00:48:02,392
end up being the culprit.

675
00:48:06,562 --> 00:48:10,149
I mean, I'm not saying that's true
about Ko Na-heun's case.

676
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:13,152
Goodness.

677
00:48:13,236 --> 00:48:18,116
Some people are mopping like crazy,
and others are fixing their makeup. Jeez.

678
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:20,410
Please have some drinks as you work.

679
00:48:20,493 --> 00:48:21,744
Here you go.

680
00:48:21,828 --> 00:48:22,662
Thank you.

681
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:25,456
I'm sorry,

682
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:27,500
but can I check some security footage?

683
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:28,751
- Security footage?
- Yes.

684
00:48:28,835 --> 00:48:30,420
It's not allowed for security reasons.

685
00:48:30,503 --> 00:48:33,673
Of course, not. I know it's not allowed,

686
00:48:33,756 --> 00:48:38,177
but someone keeps dumping trash
in front of the deputy chief's office.

687
00:48:38,261 --> 00:48:39,971
- Mr. Cha's office?
- Yes.

688
00:48:40,054 --> 00:48:42,098
He's very upset about it.

689
00:48:42,181 --> 00:48:44,809
Who would dare to do something like that?

690
00:48:44,892 --> 00:48:46,519
- I know.
- How strange.

691
00:48:46,602 --> 00:48:47,812
Let's take a look.

692
00:48:53,192 --> 00:48:55,361
It's a blind spot, so we can't see.

693
00:48:59,657 --> 00:49:00,533
Okay, then.

694
00:49:00,616 --> 00:49:01,451
Thank you.

695
00:49:01,534 --> 00:49:02,410
I appreciate it.

696
00:49:02,493 --> 00:49:03,953
- Thanks for the drinks.
- Sure.

697
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:20,094
<i>They came here in the middle of the day
to deliver the letter.</i>

698
00:49:20,845 --> 00:49:22,138
<i>It's someone who works here.</i>

699
00:49:34,358 --> 00:49:35,318
DIRECTOR BAEK CHEOL-GYU

700
00:50:05,223 --> 00:50:06,390
What are you doing?

701
00:50:06,474 --> 00:50:08,684
When I use my instincts to search…

702
00:50:11,437 --> 00:50:13,022
There was a drawer here?

703
00:50:16,317 --> 00:50:17,610
…I score big sometimes.

704
00:50:21,113 --> 00:50:22,240
There's nothing here.

705
00:50:23,115 --> 00:50:24,909
<i>The fierce presence Ga-yeong mentioned.</i>

706
00:50:35,086 --> 00:50:36,170
Are you okay?

707
00:50:39,632 --> 00:50:40,800
I'll take care of this.

708
00:50:40,883 --> 00:50:41,926
Can you take the boxes?

709
00:50:42,009 --> 00:50:43,344
- The boxes? Okay.
- Yes.

710
00:50:51,227 --> 00:50:52,144
Are you okay?

711
00:50:52,853 --> 00:50:54,605
- Could you help me a little?
- Sure.

712
00:50:55,189 --> 00:50:56,107
One, two…

713
00:51:01,362 --> 00:51:03,072
- Tell me if you need help.
- Okay.

714
00:51:07,952 --> 00:51:09,453
You should take your coat off.

715
00:51:09,537 --> 00:51:10,746
No, it's fine.

716
00:51:14,166 --> 00:51:15,751
It's harder to carry the boxes.

717
00:51:18,004 --> 00:51:19,255
Fierce presence, my foot.

718
00:51:25,761 --> 00:51:29,724
Yes, once the hospital records are done,
get a warrant for the director's house.

719
00:51:30,725 --> 00:51:31,559
Okay, bye.

720
00:51:38,024 --> 00:51:38,858
We need to talk.

721
00:51:48,943 --> 00:51:50,445
Why did you really come here?

722
00:51:51,237 --> 00:51:52,072
Why?

723
00:51:56,660 --> 00:52:00,497
People think you're here to take a break,
and I would've thought so too

724
00:52:01,206 --> 00:52:03,208
if it weren't for my dad's intel.

725
00:52:04,751 --> 00:52:07,379
What did your successful
law firm CEO father say?

726
00:52:07,462 --> 00:52:08,672
You volunteered to come.

727
00:52:09,172 --> 00:52:10,382
But what's to gain here?

728
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,679
I thought about it after the case
was reassigned, and something was strange.

729
00:52:15,762 --> 00:52:19,140
There are way more cases
to snatch up in Seoul than here,

730
00:52:19,724 --> 00:52:22,811
so why would you come all the way here?

731
00:52:24,604 --> 00:52:25,522
Thanks for the drink.

732
00:52:25,605 --> 00:52:27,482
You didn't come to steal what's mine.

733
00:52:27,565 --> 00:52:28,692
You came here

734
00:52:29,859 --> 00:52:31,069
for my case.

735
00:52:32,487 --> 00:52:34,406
I ended up in hot water because of that.

736
00:52:35,573 --> 00:52:36,991
Thanks to my successful dad,

737
00:52:37,075 --> 00:52:39,911
I can't sleep at night
when someone takes what's mine.

738
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:42,747
Just wait and see
what I take from you.

739
00:52:50,505 --> 00:52:51,756
Jeez.

740
00:52:53,425 --> 00:52:56,052
- I'll take care of that if you're done.
- It's fine.

741
00:52:56,136 --> 00:52:57,554
- Let me.
- I'll throw it away.

742
00:52:57,637 --> 00:52:58,930
Thank you, sir.

743
00:53:07,522 --> 00:53:08,732
Gye Ji-ung?

744
00:53:11,067 --> 00:53:12,068
Gye…

745
00:53:13,069 --> 00:53:13,945
No way.

746
00:53:20,577 --> 00:53:21,411
Ms. Lim Sun?

747
00:53:24,497 --> 00:53:25,457
Hello.

748
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:28,835
I was very surprised when you disappeared
from the ER that day.

749
00:53:29,461 --> 00:53:31,254
Right, sorry about that.

750
00:53:31,337 --> 00:53:33,840
Something urgent came up that day.

751
00:53:33,923 --> 00:53:34,883
Excuse me.

752
00:53:34,966 --> 00:53:36,092
Just a moment.

753
00:53:36,676 --> 00:53:38,887
Take your blood test results
while you're here.

754
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:42,640
- The results?
- Yes. This way, please.

755
00:53:58,656 --> 00:54:00,450
Damn it.

756
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:09,292
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

757
00:54:10,794 --> 00:54:11,711
Hello, Detective Kwon.

758
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:13,254
<i>Hello, Mr. Gye.</i>

759
00:54:13,338 --> 00:54:15,381
I think Baek Cheol-gyu is onto us.

760
00:54:15,465 --> 00:54:18,134
<i>We don't know
if he's actually in the hospital.</i>

761
00:54:18,218 --> 00:54:19,385
What do you mean?

762
00:54:19,469 --> 00:54:22,013
<i>It was strange how he was
nowhere to be found during the raid.</i>

763
00:54:22,096 --> 00:54:23,264
What about his car?

764
00:54:23,348 --> 00:54:24,974
Well, his car's here.

765
00:54:25,058 --> 00:54:26,935
It hasn't moved.

766
00:54:27,852 --> 00:54:29,145
But gosh, this is…

767
00:54:29,229 --> 00:54:30,230
it feels really off.

768
00:54:30,313 --> 00:54:32,440
Check the security footage first.

769
00:54:32,524 --> 00:54:34,692
If he did get out, it'll be on camera.

770
00:54:34,776 --> 00:54:36,653
Or he could've left in another car.

771
00:54:36,736 --> 00:54:39,572
But they're conducting
the search and seizure now.

772
00:54:39,656 --> 00:54:41,699
Do you think they'll agree to cooperate?

773
00:54:41,783 --> 00:54:43,243
We'll have to try our best.

774
00:54:43,326 --> 00:54:44,619
Okay, I understand. Bye.

HWADONG MEDICAL CENTER

776
00:54:56,381 --> 00:54:58,049
For crying out loud!

777
00:54:58,132 --> 00:55:00,468
An arrest warrant for what?

778
00:55:00,552 --> 00:55:03,638
Baek Cheol-gyu disappeared
as soon as the search started.

779
00:55:03,721 --> 00:55:04,973
What did you find?

780
00:55:05,056 --> 00:55:06,933
We couldn't review the documents yet.

781
00:55:07,016 --> 00:55:09,227
He knows he's guilty
of something, so he ran.

782
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:12,272
You can't get an arrest warrant
without evidence!

783
00:55:14,566 --> 00:55:16,526
Then, let me search his home.

784
00:55:16,609 --> 00:55:18,361
For crying out loud!

785
00:55:18,444 --> 00:55:19,696
Are you kidding me?

786
00:55:19,779 --> 00:55:21,489
Gosh, you're so stubborn!

787
00:55:22,115 --> 00:55:22,949
Hey!

788
00:55:24,909 --> 00:55:28,538
If you want a warrant, bring me something!
Work all night if you have to!

789
00:55:28,621 --> 00:55:30,039
That's the only way!

790
00:55:37,255 --> 00:55:38,631
Wait.

791
00:55:39,841 --> 00:55:43,303
By any chance,
did something happen to Mi-jin?

792
00:55:44,721 --> 00:55:45,930
Why are you asking me?

793
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:47,974
I'm worried.

794
00:55:48,057 --> 00:55:50,685
If you're that worried about her,
then call her.

795
00:55:50,768 --> 00:55:51,895
Don't ask me.

796
00:55:53,229 --> 00:55:54,606
She won't…

797
00:55:55,857 --> 00:55:57,066
answer her phone.

798
00:56:06,743 --> 00:56:08,912

803
00:56:38,066 --> 00:56:39,692
Good job. See you at the office.

804
00:56:39,776 --> 00:56:41,027
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

805
00:56:43,321 --> 00:56:44,447
Have you seen Ms. Lim?

806
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:46,199
No, we haven't.

807
00:56:54,207 --> 00:56:56,125
<i>The number you've dialed is unavailable--</i>

808
00:56:56,209 --> 00:56:58,086
Where did she go?

809
00:56:59,087 --> 00:57:00,588
Why didn't she say anything?

810
00:58:26,382 --> 00:58:27,925
DOCUMENTS

811
00:58:31,888 --> 00:58:32,805
<i>The number you've…</i>

812
00:58:32,889 --> 00:58:34,599
Where in the world is she?

813
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,237
This is her.

814
00:58:48,321 --> 00:58:51,199
Can you check to see
if she was caught on CCTV?

815
00:58:51,282 --> 00:58:52,450
I have to find her.

816
00:58:52,533 --> 00:58:54,452
- I need your help.
- Yes, I understand.

817
00:58:54,535 --> 00:58:56,621
- I'll take a picture of this.
- Okay.

818
00:58:58,206 --> 00:58:59,123
Here you go.

819
00:59:02,126 --> 00:59:03,795
Did you find the van?

820
00:59:03,878 --> 00:59:05,004
<i>Yes.</i>

821
00:59:05,088 --> 00:59:06,631
We were tracking it,

822
00:59:06,714 --> 00:59:10,093
but it disappeared after leaving
Lee Mi-jin's place last night.

823
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:13,888
It's unregistered,
so I think they switched the plates.

824
00:59:13,971 --> 00:59:16,808
<i>There have been a lot of incidents lately.</i>

825
00:59:16,891 --> 00:59:20,395
<i>So just as a precaution,
how about thinking of ways</i>

826
00:59:20,478 --> 00:59:23,106
<i>to keep Lee Mi-jin safe?</i>

827
00:59:24,524 --> 00:59:25,358
<i>Well?</i>

828
00:59:25,441 --> 00:59:26,359
<i>Hello?</i>

829
00:59:27,902 --> 00:59:30,613
But if I'm a witness,

830
00:59:30,696 --> 00:59:33,408
why haven't the police called me yet?

831
00:59:33,491 --> 00:59:34,909
- I didn't tell them.
- Why not?

832
00:59:34,992 --> 00:59:36,619
<i>- Because of trust.
- You don't trust me?</i>

833
00:59:36,702 --> 00:59:37,745
<i>I can't trust the police.</i>

834
00:59:37,829 --> 00:59:40,915
What if you came to the station
as a witness, got exposed,

835
00:59:40,998 --> 00:59:41,874
and became a target?

836
00:59:41,958 --> 00:59:44,210
So you should catch the culprit sooner.

837
00:59:44,293 --> 00:59:45,753
<i>Is there anything I can testify to?</i>

838
00:59:45,837 --> 00:59:48,339
<i>Getting involved could put you
in danger so listen to me.</i>

839
00:59:48,423 --> 00:59:49,382
<i>Still.</i>

840
00:59:49,465 --> 00:59:51,426
What if they come after me?

841
00:59:51,509 --> 00:59:52,635
We need to catch them.

842
00:59:53,177 --> 00:59:54,470
So until then,

843
00:59:54,554 --> 00:59:55,638
<i>you can trust me.</i>

844
00:59:57,098 --> 00:59:57,974
Lee Mi-jin!

845
01:00:01,436 --> 01:00:04,564
