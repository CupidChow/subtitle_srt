1
00:00:50,132 --> 00:00:54,762
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

2
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:00,268
You.

3
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,273
You…

4
00:01:07,608 --> 00:01:08,651
You're Sun, right?

5
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:11,863
Are you Sun?

6
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:12,780
Honey.

7
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,574
Wait a second, honey.

8
00:01:15,449 --> 00:01:16,659
You're Sun, aren't you?

9
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,244
Right?

10
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:24,792
Sun.

11
00:01:25,793 --> 00:01:27,086
You're her, aren't you?

12
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:29,589
Right, Sun?

13
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:32,300
See, honey! I told you Sun was alive.

14
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,969
She's standing right here alive.
She's not dead!

15
00:01:35,052 --> 00:01:35,887
Sun.

16
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,347
Where have you been all this time?

17
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:41,392
Where were you?
You've been doing okay, right?

18
00:01:42,059 --> 00:01:45,354
You came because you missed me,
but I didn't recognize you.

19
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,857
I kept kicking you out
and chasing you away.

20
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,774
I'm so sorry.

21
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:49,942
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,861
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

23
00:01:51,944 --> 00:01:53,154
I'm not Aunt Sun.

24
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,365
I'm Mi-jin.

25
00:01:58,075 --> 00:01:59,452
What are you talking about?

26
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,788
What is it?
Are you mad I didn't recognize you?

27
00:02:03,372 --> 00:02:04,248
I'm so sorry.

28
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,834
I'm really sorry.

29
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,669
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

30
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:10,796
I'm sorry, Sun.

31
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:13,841
My goodness.

32
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,478
Sun.

33
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,939
I'm so sorry.

34
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,283
Dad.

35
00:02:53,714 --> 00:02:54,548
Mi-jin?

36
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:55,716
What?

37
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,895
You…

38
00:03:09,271 --> 00:03:11,607
Where did Sun go? What?

39
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,858
Where did Sun go?

40
00:03:15,444 --> 00:03:17,405
Mi-jin? Where's your aunt?

41
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,073
Your aunt.

42
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:20,783
Where?

43
00:03:21,742 --> 00:03:22,743
Mom.

44
00:03:24,745 --> 00:03:26,163
She can't come back anymore.

45
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:27,998
You saw it too.

46
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,668
Aunt Sun…

47
00:03:30,751 --> 00:03:32,753
Let's put her to rest.

48
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,674
It's the only way
she'll be able to find peace.

49
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:38,134
Okay?

50
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,595
But Mi-jin…

51
00:03:42,304 --> 00:03:43,222
Why are you…

52
00:03:44,306 --> 00:03:45,307
Why?

53
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:49,812
Honey?

54
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,023
Mi-jin, why?

55
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,358
Why?

56
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,569
Why is my girl like this?

57
00:03:57,903 --> 00:03:58,946
Why?

58
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,615
Wait, what is this?

59
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:04,827
What happened to my daughter?

60
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:10,708
My goodness!

61
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,794
Heavenly Father!

62
00:04:23,637 --> 00:04:25,181
SEOHAN DISTRICT COURT

63
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:27,767
The defendant has admitted guilt
and shown remorse.

64
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,228
He has cooperated with investigations,
served the community for years,

65
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,605
and is currently in poor health.

66
00:04:32,688 --> 00:04:36,108
Taking the kidnapping victim's
request for leniency

67
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,777
and other factors into account,

68
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,863
we hereby sentence the defendant
to three years in prison.

69
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,622
I was wondering if she would,

70
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,832
but I guess Ms. Lee isn't coming.

71
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,505
She won't be able to.

72
00:04:59,298 --> 00:05:00,883
But she'll be at Gong Gi-cheol's trial.

73
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:02,802
What?

74
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,429
You didn't know?
Ms. Tak summoned her as a witness.

75
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,520
She'll have to submit
a witness absence statement.

76
00:05:13,687 --> 00:05:16,190
Why? I guess it would be hard
for her to attend?

77
00:05:16,273 --> 00:05:18,526
She has a reason
why she can't come during the day.

78
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:20,736
Did you hear?

79
00:05:24,448 --> 00:05:27,159
Lee Mi-jin's attending
Gong Gi-cheol's trial.

80
00:05:28,702 --> 00:05:29,912
I was curious.

81
00:05:30,412 --> 00:05:31,956
What's so special about her?

82
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:34,875
Why would the great Gye Ji-ung
go to such lengths to protect her?

83
00:05:44,301 --> 00:05:46,428
Wait, what's going on?

84
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:59,942
I have to do whatever I can
to return to my original state.

85
00:06:01,151 --> 00:06:02,444
For me

86
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,697
and for my mom and dad.

87
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,454
Still, just in case,

88
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,708
I have to prepare.

89
00:06:21,088 --> 00:06:22,256
MY BUCKET LIST

90
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:23,465
Number one.

91
00:06:24,508 --> 00:06:26,677
- Mom, get up.
- Okay.

92
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,429
Take Mom and Dad to the hospital.

93
00:06:28,512 --> 00:06:30,139
- Have them get medical check-ups.
- Me?

94
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:32,266
- We'll go if you're ready.
- Okay.

95
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:35,769
Number two.

96
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,396
Abstain from drinking.

97
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:42,443
Allow for drinking only once a week.

98
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,698
Or twice a week?

99
00:06:48,824 --> 00:06:49,909
Yeah, twice a week!

100
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:55,331
Okay, ladies. Have fun with it!

101
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,917
- Left, right!
- Number three. Join a gym.

102
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,002
- It's to prevent rapid aging.
- Left!

103
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:02,713
- Just a little.
- Okay, all the way. Let's go!

104
00:07:02,796 --> 00:07:04,715
One, two, three, four!

105
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:08,552
All right!

106
00:07:11,138 --> 00:07:13,057
- See you next time!
- Great job!

107
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,767
Great work.

108
00:07:16,268 --> 00:07:19,855
But what if I suddenly
get really old or sick?

109
00:07:20,981 --> 00:07:23,525
What about my mom and dad?

110
00:07:26,403 --> 00:07:27,321
Number four.

111
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,157
Take out an insurance policy.

112
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:32,660
Number five.

113
00:07:33,535 --> 00:07:34,995
Just in case,

114
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,331
look into nursing homes.

115
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,583
Number six.

116
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:40,834
Do good deeds.

117
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:44,380
- There you go.
- Maybe volunteer to help abandoned cats?

118
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:46,507
I know it's a hassle,
but we have to clean our face.

119
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,050
Good kitty.

120
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:50,886
Look at your tail standing up!

121
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,179
Here's your food.

122
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,681
This cat looks just like me.

123
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,015
Look at its face.

124
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:56,684
It's you.

125
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,396
- Number seven.
- Careful, it'll burn!

126
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,524
Go on trips with my parents
while they're still healthy.

127
00:08:03,607 --> 00:08:04,900
- That's hot!
- It's good!

128
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:05,943
Have some meat now.

129
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:08,362
- Sweet and salty!
- You'll rot your teeth!

130
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:10,197
- It's okay.
- Meat needs garlic.

131
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,615
It's so good.

132
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,909
One, two, three!

133
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,577
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

134
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,870
- Number eight.
- Okay.

135
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:19,123
- Take lots of pictures.
- One, two, three.

136
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,417
Kisses! One, two, three.

137
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,836
Do it to Mom! Okay. One, two, three.

138
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,254
Wow!

139
00:08:29,174 --> 00:08:30,092
I'll deliver this.

140
00:08:30,175 --> 00:08:31,010
- Number nine.
- Okay!

141
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:31,927
Bye, Dad.

142
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,929
- Find something I can do.
- I need meat for stew.

143
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:34,888
- For a stew?
- Yes.

144
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,807
Business? Cleaning?

145
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,808
Thank you.

146
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:39,143
Or take mom's job?

147
00:08:39,226 --> 00:08:40,227
Yeah, I did it.

148
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,687
And run her butcher's shop?

149
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:44,773
Do two of these make 600 grams?

150
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:45,899
It's a bit more.

151
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,901
- Okay, I'll take these two.
- These two?

152
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:04,209
Do you know what's scarier
than studying again?

153
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,838
It's having to face another situation
where I have to give up.

154
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:10,966
That's why I want you to do
something you like.

155
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:13,385
Whatever that may be,

156
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,970
even if it's not studying,

157
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:17,264
I want you to do what you love

158
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,558
and feel excited instead of being scared.

159
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:27,316
Yeah, I should do
what I really want to do.

160
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,651
Number ten.

161
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:33,864
Do what I really want to do.

162
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,039
Mi-jin, come and eat…

163
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,559
MY BUCKET LIST

164
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:12,653
Goodness.

165
00:10:22,746 --> 00:10:23,747
Mi-jin!

166
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,084
Get up.

167
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:28,335
What are you doing?

168
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,628
- Get up.
- But why?

169
00:10:29,711 --> 00:10:30,921
We have somewhere to go.

170
00:10:31,004 --> 00:10:32,589
- Go where?
- Come on!

171
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,049
Mom, what's wrong with you?

172
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,051
- Where are we going?
- I said come on!

173
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,719
Tell me first!

174
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,222
There's a skilled shaman
at the foot of Obongsan. Let's go.

175
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:42,933
Jeez, I've already tried it!

176
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,769
I tried everything!

177
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,857
Jeez! No matter what I do,
it doesn't work!

178
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,818
That shaman said,
"Show me, show me, show me."

179
00:10:52,901 --> 00:10:55,237
But he didn't see anything
and couldn't fix me!

180
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,780
Skilled, my foot! I won't go.

181
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,158
So you're going to keep living like this?

182
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,909
You said you're getting older!

183
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,911
What if you become older than me?

184
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,913
How are you going to live then? How?

185
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,707
What do you think?

186
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,461
I'll just live with you two until I die.

187
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,713
Why would you die, you brat?

188
00:11:12,796 --> 00:11:15,174
Is that why you wrote all that
in your notebook?

189
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:18,552
The things to do before you die.
What was it? A bucket list?

190
00:11:18,635 --> 00:11:19,970
That's just…

191
00:11:20,053 --> 00:11:23,432
I could just end up
continuing to live like this.

192
00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:24,975
I just wanted to prepare.

193
00:11:25,058 --> 00:11:27,394
Why on earth would you live like that?

194
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,106
I mean, what do you want me to do?

195
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,065
Goodness.

196
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,359
This is driving me crazy.

197
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:37,196
- Seriously.
- My goodness!

198
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,697
This is ridiculous.

199
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,490
I'll get wrinkles if I cry.

200
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,034
What?

201
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,703
Goodness, I can't believe this.

202
00:11:57,966 --> 00:11:58,800
Put some on.

203
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,177
But this is Mom's.

204
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,595
It's okay. I bought it.

205
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,140
- Here too.
- Okay.

206
00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:07,184
That is a bit better.

207
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:09,269
You're slowly getting
more premature gray hairs.

208
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,230
They're not premature. They are grey.

209
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,149
- They are?
- I should dye my hair, right?

210
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,150
I have some!

211
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:19,071
- It needs to help prevent hair loss too.
- What?

212
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:20,614
Is this all-natural?

213
00:12:20,697 --> 00:12:21,907
Probably.

214
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,910
- Jeez, you need to get reading glasses.
- What?

215
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,246
Can I borrow these, Mom?

216
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,458
These are comfortable
once you get used to them.

217
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:33,794
It is all-natural.

218
00:12:33,877 --> 00:12:34,711
Good grief.

219
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,880
It would've been nice if it was brighter.

220
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,215
I think it's just black.

221
00:12:38,298 --> 00:12:39,424
Whatever.

222
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,301
Can you do this for me?

223
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,386
Okay.

224
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,055
- I'm good at it.
- Here.

225
00:12:46,723 --> 00:12:48,308
- Ga-yeong.
- I have so many grays now.

226
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,226
Sun…

227
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:50,644
I've been through so much.

228
00:12:50,727 --> 00:12:53,188
Mi-jin is driving me crazy.

229
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,190
- If you'd told me…
- Can you take her away?

230
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,276
- Come on!
- Just come with me!

231
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,361
- For crying out loud!
- Come on!

232
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:00,779
Why are we here?

233
00:13:00,862 --> 00:13:04,324
The culprit has been caught,
but you didn't change back.

234
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:07,202
You could be old like this forever.
You need to take care of yourself.

235
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,997
I can't afford it. I'm leaving.

236
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,832
- Come on!
- What's with you?

237
00:13:11,915 --> 00:13:14,584
It was a two-for-one deal.
I already had mine done.

238
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,461
How's my radiant and dewy skin?

239
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,592
Want to try? Just once?

240
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,469
Two-for-one? Let's go!

241
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,180
This is to make up
for the scar under your chin.

242
00:13:28,223 --> 00:13:30,142
That machine can really get rid of it?

243
00:13:30,225 --> 00:13:31,643
Jeez, just trust me.

244
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,146
- Hello!
- Hello.

245
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,650
Goodness, your daughter
must care about you so much.

246
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,986
She made the reservation
and brought you here herself.

247
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,238
I'm leaving.

248
00:13:43,905 --> 00:13:44,865
My goodness.

249
00:13:44,948 --> 00:13:45,866
Please do it fast.

250
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:47,409
Okay. Ma'am!

251
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:49,453
This doesn't hurt at all. Calm down.

252
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,538
So…

253
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,166
- Goodness!
- Mom.

254
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,678
I'll do what I can
to drag Mi-jin around all day,

255
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,388
so no need to worry.

256
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,560
- Wow!
- It's so bright!

257
00:14:13,643 --> 00:14:15,645
You look ten years younger!

258
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,398
- Really?
- Yeah, it's so cool!

259
00:14:19,524 --> 00:14:20,525
What do you think?

260
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,987
But I'm already 29.

261
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,281
What's great
about looking ten years younger?

262
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,701
Come on.

263
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:32,371
Everything's on me today.
Okay? Just leave it to me.

264
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,955
Come with me. Let's go.

265
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:36,875
Let's go! It's all on me!

266
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,585
- Which one? This?
- The first one.

267
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:41,129
Okay, it's ready.

268
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,089
- Look here.
- Okay.

269
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,173
One, two, three.

270
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,221
- What's that?
- Smile. One, two, three.

271
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,141
Hey, you wanted to do it!

272
00:14:54,142 --> 00:14:55,018
Wait!

273
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,564
TAKE PHOTOS HERE

274
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,866
Lady.

275
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:10,867
I'm not a lady!

276
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:11,952
Are you kidding me, lady?

277
00:15:12,035 --> 00:15:13,787
I was born in 1996!

278
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,871
More like 1969!

279
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,959
Why did you push me?

280
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:20,877
You want me to call the cops?

281
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:24,840
Should we go?

282
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:26,717
- Okay.
- What do you want to eat?

283
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,720
I know a great place.

284
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:36,518
I'm hungry now after all that fun.
I recently found an amazing restaurant.

285
00:15:37,477 --> 00:15:38,311
What is it?

286
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,397
What?

287
00:15:41,064 --> 00:15:42,107
You want pig's trotters?

288
00:15:44,317 --> 00:15:47,279
Let's not go here.
No, let's get chicken instead.

289
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,366
Mr. Chu
On my lips, chu

290
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,368
Sweetly, chu

291
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,371
I lose all strength in my body

292
00:15:56,455 --> 00:16:00,709
You shake up my heart
You shake me up

293
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:04,713
I'm falling, falling for your love

294
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:07,257
Hey, you
On my lips, chu

295
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,426
What is it? What are you doing? Let's go.

296
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,638
I found a great chicken place recently.

297
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,932
They don't use sugar,
so their food's not sweet.

298
00:16:18,101 --> 00:16:20,103
I told you everything was on me today.

299
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,855
This is the best part.

300
00:16:21,938 --> 00:16:24,024
Can we not go in here?

301
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,360
Why not? This place is good!

302
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,113
You don't want to go?

303
00:16:31,114 --> 00:16:32,324
Come on, let's go.

304
00:16:36,536 --> 00:16:37,370
Damn.

305
00:16:38,705 --> 00:16:39,956
You can have both drumsticks.

306
00:16:45,545 --> 00:16:48,006
- Enjoy.
- It looks so good!

307
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:49,132
Eat up.

308
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,260
It looks so good.

309
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:55,806
No!

310
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:08,944
Babe!

311
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:28,797
Right.

312
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,930
What? I gave you both drumsticks.
Why are you so depressed?

313
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,766
To be honest,

314
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:42,602
I once came here when I was working.

315
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:46,898
I see. Damn it.

316
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:49,234
I picked the wrong place.

317
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,114
I didn't really know it back then.

318
00:17:55,198 --> 00:17:56,241
Know what?

319
00:17:57,158 --> 00:17:58,285
I didn't know

320
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,328
just how much

321
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,791
I liked that job.

322
00:18:06,209 --> 00:18:07,335
But you know what?

323
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,423
I only realized after it was gone.

324
00:18:13,633 --> 00:18:15,594
It's just like my youth.

325
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,601
What on earth?
Since when did you become an old soul?

326
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,686
Did you age emotionally too?

327
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,153
Thanks to you,

328
00:18:33,653 --> 00:18:36,990
I know what I want to do now.

329
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:38,992
What is it?

330
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,124
It's good.

331
00:18:46,207 --> 00:18:47,292
What is it?

332
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,837
You're not going to tell me?

333
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:53,632
Then, give this back. Okay.

334
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,355
Goodness, he's back again.

335
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:54,192
Why does he look so thin?

336
00:19:54,275 --> 00:19:56,111
That handsome face is wasting away.

337
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,697
- Stay here.
- What?

338
00:20:02,325 --> 00:20:03,493
Go give this to him.

339
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,705
Tell him not to skip his meals.

340
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:07,956
- All right.
- Okay.

341
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,427
You don't have to visit.

342
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,472
I couldn't even if I wanted to.
I've been called up to Seoul.

343
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,517
Really? That's great.

344
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,476
Yes.

345
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,354
- Thank you for everything.
- Gosh, I didn't do anything.

346
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,355
- Take this.
- No.

347
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,440
- You don't have to.
- Stop.

348
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,191
You'll upset her. Just take it.

349
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:38,611
Please thank her for me.

350
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:39,529
Okay.

351
00:20:41,614 --> 00:20:43,366
I'm almost home now.

352
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,202
I'll get going now.

353
00:20:46,911 --> 00:20:48,371
- Mr. Gye!
- Yes?

354
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:52,459
Gosh, there are so many stars out tonight.

355
00:20:59,632 --> 00:21:00,717
What's he looking at?

356
00:21:03,344 --> 00:21:06,639
You know, the plum wine we made
fermented really well.

357
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:07,849
How about a glass?

358
00:21:07,932 --> 00:21:09,476
I drove here.

359
00:21:11,227 --> 00:21:13,688
- I'll go now--
- Wait!

360
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:17,734
There was something I wanted to tell you
one last time. Will you hear me out?

361
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:21,571
- Sure.
- The thing is you're always so busy.

362
00:21:22,113 --> 00:21:23,615
I bet you can't work out much.

363
00:21:23,698 --> 00:21:25,825
I want to teach you some stretches.

364
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:28,870
Try this. Follow me.
Put that down and try.

365
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,874
- Follow me.
- Okay.

366
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,504
To the left too.

367
00:21:39,672 --> 00:21:42,008
Goodness, you're so stiff.

368
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,219
Grab my shoulders and press down.

369
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:48,056
Press harder!

370
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:49,974
Are you okay?

371
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,644
You're good. Should we try this too?

372
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:54,604
Now, stretch.

373
00:21:54,687 --> 00:21:56,189
You have to pull too.

374
00:21:56,272 --> 00:21:57,398
Okay.

375
00:21:57,982 --> 00:21:59,192
Are you okay?

376
00:21:59,275 --> 00:22:01,945
What are they doing?
Why are they exercising at night?

377
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,863
I don't believe this.

378
00:22:19,003 --> 00:22:20,213
You must work out.

379
00:22:20,296 --> 00:22:21,422
Yes, in my spare time.

380
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,093
Okay, then.

381
00:22:25,176 --> 00:22:26,177
Right.

382
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,513
I'll be on my way now.

383
00:22:28,596 --> 00:22:30,849
Wait… Well…

384
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,396
- Take care of yourself.
- I will, sir.

385
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,022
Goodbye.

386
00:22:39,148 --> 00:22:40,984
Hey, drive safely.

387
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,652
- Okay.
- Yeah.

388
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,573
Is Mr. Gye leaving?

389
00:23:06,342 --> 00:23:08,052
Damn it!

390
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,722
Goodness.

391
00:23:12,932 --> 00:23:14,767
Dad, Mom!

392
00:23:16,185 --> 00:23:18,563
What took you so long?
You said you'd come ages ago!

393
00:23:18,646 --> 00:23:19,856
Stop it.

394
00:23:19,939 --> 00:23:20,773
Jeez.

395
00:23:22,942 --> 00:23:24,235
What's with him?

396
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,029
You should've come earlier, you brat.

397
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,366
But is it something
to get that angry about?

398
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,534
I don't know!

399
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:37,582
Jeez.

400
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,229
I'll be on my way now.

401
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,440
Hey, drive safely.

402
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:03,775
Hey…

403
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:05,902
Don't forget about me.

404
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:07,654
- Okay.
- All right.

405
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:39,352
Come on.

406
00:24:40,144 --> 00:24:41,479
Let's go.

407
00:24:41,562 --> 00:24:42,814
Let's do what needs to be done.

408
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:46,526
Do what needs to be done. I'll do that.

409
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:53,366
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW

410
00:24:54,158 --> 00:24:55,952
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,545
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

412
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:18,683
It's so…

413
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,226
expensive.

414
00:25:26,649 --> 00:25:27,984
LOCAL DEALS
SECONDHAND

415
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:31,612
You're not buying
secondhand couple rings, are you?

416
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,699
Rings from couples who break up
before three months are practically new.

417
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:38,036
But still, how could you buy
secondhand rings?

418
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,204
You know my current financial situation.

419
00:25:40,788 --> 00:25:42,623
Then, get ones within your budget.

420
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,542
Why go overboard and get scammed again?

421
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:46,836
Then, to make up for that,
you'll be scammed again.

422
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:48,421
What's wrong with secondhand rings?

423
00:25:48,504 --> 00:25:50,715
If you look carefully,
new and unopened ones suddenly…

424
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:52,091
Holy cow!

425
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:00,475
WEDDING RINGS IMPORTED FROM US
800,000 WON

426
00:26:07,273 --> 00:26:09,442
If you buy this,
you're hitting the jackpot.

427
00:26:13,988 --> 00:26:16,574
A Cartier at this price
is pretty much a steal.

428
00:26:16,657 --> 00:26:17,658
They're practically new.

429
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,994
They're not "practically new."
They are new.

430
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,537
How long were they worn for?

431
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:24,707
Honestly, they were never worn.
We broke up on the first day.

432
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,542
- I might jinx it.
- But we got back together.

433
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:27,960
You should wear them then.

434
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,922
My business became really successful
after we got back together.

435
00:26:31,005 --> 00:26:33,466
So I got
four-carat diamond rings instead.

436
00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:34,759
Really sparkly, right?

437
00:26:34,842 --> 00:26:36,052
Wow.

438
00:26:36,135 --> 00:26:37,804
That's absolutely incredible.

439
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:39,263
I see.

440
00:26:40,014 --> 00:26:42,183
But if you look at them closely,

441
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,393
I see some fine scratches.

442
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,689
Where? I can't see them.

443
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,400
No, right there.
It's about 0.2 millimeters long.

444
00:26:51,859 --> 00:26:54,237
- I'll give you a discount then.
- Yes, of course.

445
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,114
- How much?
- Okay, I'll take 5,000 won off.

446
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,073
That's all?

447
00:26:57,156 --> 00:26:59,408
Plus another 5,000 won,
so a 10,000-won discount.

448
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,828
Thank you. I'll transfer the money now.

449
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,037
- Quickly.
- Okay.

450
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,749
I knew this would happen.

451
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:08,876
Mr. Gye.

452
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,961
Long time no see.

453
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,839
What are you doing here, sir?

454
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,423
I should ask the same for you.

455
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:17,135
Where do you think you're going?

456
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,219
My hair. Wait.

457
00:27:18,302 --> 00:27:20,388
- You'll pull it out.
- Come peacefully.

458
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,561
Last time was our first meeting,
so it took ten minutes.

459
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:29,105
Since we're already familiar,
let's make it quick. Get up.

460
00:27:29,188 --> 00:27:30,690
I can't believe this!

461
00:27:30,773 --> 00:27:32,692
Was this an undercover operation?

462
00:27:32,775 --> 00:27:34,777
What's going on? Do you know him?

463
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,405
He has seven prior fraud convictions…
Wait, is it eight now?

464
00:27:37,488 --> 00:27:38,322
Gosh, I'm dying.

465
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,366
How could someone like him
get out so fast?

466
00:27:41,075 --> 00:27:42,493
Fraud?

467
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,370
Fraud?

468
00:27:44,453 --> 00:27:45,872
Fraud? You punk!

469
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:48,291
- Fraud?
- Jeez, come on.

470
00:27:48,374 --> 00:27:49,500
- Goodness.
- You punk!

471
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:50,585
Hey, you punk!

472
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:53,379
I could sue for assault, you know.

473
00:27:53,462 --> 00:27:54,714
How dare you scam me?

474
00:27:54,797 --> 00:27:56,132
Hello, Detective Kwon.

475
00:27:56,215 --> 00:27:58,467
I caught a perp on scene.
Can you pick him up?

476
00:28:02,096 --> 00:28:03,431
Come here!

477
00:28:12,231 --> 00:28:13,232
Get over here!

478
00:28:22,241 --> 00:28:23,743
Hey! Come here!

479
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,580
I got you! Come here!

480
00:28:44,555 --> 00:28:46,307
Just don't do anything from now on.

481
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:48,142
How do you get scammed so often?

482
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,271
I'm not bad for being scammed.
It's the fraud who's bad.

483
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:55,107
If you were scammed once,
you should be more careful.

484
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,318
Why would you dive
straight into a mess like that?

485
00:28:57,401 --> 00:28:59,320
It was clearly a scam.
How do you fall for that?

486
00:28:59,403 --> 00:29:00,780
For goodness' sake.

487
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:04,784
Pull over by the station over there.

488
00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:07,245
Why? Are you going to stay
at a bathhouse again?

489
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,371
Why would you care?

490
00:29:10,998 --> 00:29:11,916
Here.

491
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:15,378
What's this?

492
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,296
I mean, it's not much.

493
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,757
GIFT CERTIFICATE
HANDONG

494
00:29:20,591 --> 00:29:22,718
Mr. Gye!

495
00:29:23,594 --> 00:29:24,845
Mr. Gye, I love you!

496
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,097
- I love you!
- Get off!

497
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,265
I said I love you!

498
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,975
Go away! It's too hot for this.

499
00:29:30,851 --> 00:29:31,811
Wow.

500
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:33,688
It's a farewell gift.

501
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:39,944
What do you mean "farewell"?

502
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:44,240
Farewell? What are you talking about?

503
00:29:44,323 --> 00:29:49,161
Did you think if you gave me this,
I'd happily say goodbye? Did you?

504
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,622
Where are you going without me? Where?

505
00:29:52,206 --> 00:29:53,249
How was it?

506
00:29:53,332 --> 00:29:54,417
This is great.

507
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,460
- So pretty. Okay.
- Take it like this.

508
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:59,171
You didn't discuss it with me at all,
so tell me now.

509
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,007
Where are you going? You can tell me!

510
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,634
Tell me! This is so frustrating!

511
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:06,137
Where are you going without me?

512
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,306
Why? Why are you leaving?

513
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:11,767
Don't go! Please, don't go!
I'm right here!

514
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:19,859
Seriously.

515
00:30:19,942 --> 00:30:21,277
What do you think?

516
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,445
Hey!

517
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,579
I hated being young.

518
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:36,500
People think you can
do anything if you're young,

519
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,711
but there are so many things you can't do.

520
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:43,132
I would've rather given up my youth.

521
00:30:44,383 --> 00:30:47,261
But it wasn't until after I'd lost it

522
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:49,013
that I realized.

523
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,892
My youth was a gift.

524
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:57,229
The time we take for granted

525
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,358
never lasts forever.

526
00:31:12,244 --> 00:31:13,746
This came out well too.

527
00:31:13,829 --> 00:31:14,955
Look at this.

528
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,124
How's this?

529
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,250
- This is good.
- It's great.

530
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,335
Right?

531
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:48,739
What?

532
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:55,329
I'm leaving.

533
00:32:07,883 --> 00:32:09,427
You're leaving now?

534
00:32:10,636 --> 00:32:11,470
Yeah.

535
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:14,890
I feel so strange.

536
00:32:15,766 --> 00:32:17,435
I thought I'd be happy.

537
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,521
Didn't you want me gone?

538
00:32:21,021 --> 00:32:22,648
I did, but…

539
00:32:23,482 --> 00:32:26,527
I'm kind of at a loss
of what to do without you now.

540
00:32:30,322 --> 00:32:32,450
Just do what you've been doing.

541
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,745
You made everything I did happen.

542
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,792
I was able to do it because of you.

543
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,713
I could've never done it on my own.

544
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:48,424
You know,

545
00:32:49,216 --> 00:32:50,718
I understand how you feel.

546
00:32:51,343 --> 00:32:52,553
But you're wrong.

547
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:57,433
You were able to do it because it was you.

548
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,687
Only you could've done it.

549
00:33:03,689 --> 00:33:05,274
You're me.

550
00:33:07,067 --> 00:33:08,861
You were a gift to me.

551
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,242
But the thing is…

552
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,078
you always had that gift.

553
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,750
You just realized it a little late.

554
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:30,800
You know, being old…

555
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:33,093
was really sad.

556
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:38,224
Work as much as you can.

557
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,644
Have fun and meet lots of people.

558
00:33:42,561 --> 00:33:44,522
You can fall in love too.

559
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:47,817
But it'd be so nice to do it
when you're younger.

560
00:33:48,734 --> 00:33:49,902
That's what I think.

561
00:33:51,445 --> 00:33:52,655
You're young.

562
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,908
You should do
everything you want to do in life, right?

563
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,245
Do you think

564
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:02,373
I can be brave again

565
00:34:03,582 --> 00:34:05,835
without you?

566
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:11,215
You already are.

567
00:34:23,143 --> 00:34:24,311
I'll go now.

568
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,406
Goodbye.

569
00:35:34,381 --> 00:35:35,799
Your move isn't for a while.

570
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:37,259
But you're packing already?

571
00:35:40,512 --> 00:35:42,765
It seems like you wish I'd leave sooner.

572
00:35:42,848 --> 00:35:44,308
Of course not.

573
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:48,479
Your eyes look sad, but you're smiling.

574
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,981
That's a misunderstanding.

575
00:35:51,565 --> 00:35:52,650
Yeah, right.

576
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,153
I'll be living here
until the end of your contract,

577
00:35:56,236 --> 00:35:57,446
so I'm very grateful,

578
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,865
and I feel at ease moving in.

579
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,909
But you're really just going to leave?

580
00:36:01,992 --> 00:36:04,620
It was a sudden transfer.
I had no choice. The case is over too.

581
00:36:04,703 --> 00:36:06,372
No, not that.

582
00:36:10,834 --> 00:36:13,671
Just let me know how she's doing.
Ask Ga-yeong about her.

583
00:36:21,136 --> 00:36:22,388
You took good care of it.

584
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,022
We will begin witness examinations.

585
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,607
Witness, please step forward.

586
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,776
SEOHAN CITY SERIAL MURDER CASE

587
00:36:35,859 --> 00:36:36,860
DEFENDANT

588
00:36:43,617 --> 00:36:45,119
Is the witness not here yet?

589
00:36:46,912 --> 00:36:48,288
The witness will be here.

590
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,082
Please give her a bit more time.

591
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,796
If the witness cannot attend…

592
00:37:31,373 --> 00:37:35,002
At the abandoned house where the defendant
imprisoned Lee Mi-jin, we found…

593
00:37:37,337 --> 00:37:39,173
drugs made from poppy extract,

594
00:37:39,923 --> 00:37:41,800
the weapon used to commit the crimes,

595
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:42,843
and…

596
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,598
the victims' remains.

597
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,558
The prosecution rests.

598
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,772
WITNESS STAND

599
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:58,275
Does the defense have
any additional questions for the witness?

600
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,071
I didn't intend to kill them.

601
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,325
They brought about their own deaths.

602
00:38:06,992 --> 00:38:09,578
I said I just happened to kill them.

603
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:14,833
The statute of limitations
for the murder of my aunt…

604
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,962
and the other victims have expired.

605
00:38:19,546 --> 00:38:21,882
But the pain
that families have felt for years,

606
00:38:21,965 --> 00:38:25,969
not knowing the fate of their loved ones
who suddenly disappeared, still remains.

607
00:38:28,013 --> 00:38:28,972
Your Honor,

608
00:38:31,558 --> 00:38:33,310
as a relative of the victim

609
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:37,272
and as a victim
who was almost killed by the defendant,

610
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:40,192
I hope the defendant
will be severely punished.

611
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:16,520
- Stop looking for him.
- What?

612
00:39:16,603 --> 00:39:19,481
You keep looking around
for Mr. Gye in case he shows up.

613
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:25,487
I guess Mr. Ju isn't here yet.

614
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,698
Yeah, because it's not his case.

615
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:29,408
Right.

616
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:31,827
He's very busy too.

617
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:37,082
It's about Mr. Gye.

618
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,293
He's going back to Seoul.

619
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,088
Hey, they're starting.

620
00:39:44,798 --> 00:39:46,508
All rise.

621
00:39:54,516 --> 00:39:58,395
Verdict for criminal case number 2024-317.

622
00:39:58,937 --> 00:40:01,773
On October 15, 2024,

623
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:04,943
the defendant brutally killed
the victim Na Ok-hui

624
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:07,154
by striking her several times with an axe.

625
00:40:07,237 --> 00:40:10,073
In addition, the defendant
murdered a witness to this crime,

626
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:12,659
the victim Ko Na-heun
by severing his ankle

627
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,828
and throwing him into a reservoir.

628
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:20,584
Past crimes cannot be punished
due to expired statute of limitations.

629
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:22,711
But the murders of Na Ok-hui
and Ko Na-heun,

630
00:40:22,794 --> 00:40:25,172
the kidnapping
and imprisonment of Lee Hak-chan,

631
00:40:25,255 --> 00:40:27,966
and the kidnapping, imprisonment,
and attempted murder of Lee Mi-jin

632
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:31,428
are inhumane crimes
that cannot be tolerated.

633
00:40:31,511 --> 00:40:35,307
Despite this, the defendant shows
no remorse for her crimes

634
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:38,352
and was deemed to be
a high risk of reoffending.

635
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:43,148
Above all, the victims and their families
have requested severe punishment.

636
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:46,818
Therefore, the defendant
must be permanently removed from society.

637
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,864
The court sentences
the defendant to death.

638
00:40:55,535 --> 00:40:57,162
All rise.

639
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,205
Death?

640
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:01,833
I'm going to appeal!

641
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,085
You bastards!

642
00:41:03,168 --> 00:41:04,962
I'll sue you all!

643
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:07,589
Let go! Let go of me.

644
00:41:09,174 --> 00:41:11,885
You damn beast!

645
00:41:13,845 --> 00:41:16,348
You call yourself a human being?

646
00:41:16,431 --> 00:41:18,183
You killed my sister

647
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,435
and tried to kill my daughter too?

648
00:41:21,311 --> 00:41:23,897
Death is too good for you

649
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,440
and Hell wouldn't be enough.

650
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:26,942
You damn devil.

651
00:41:27,567 --> 00:41:29,778
You better wait in Hell for me.

652
00:41:29,861 --> 00:41:32,114
I'm going to chase you down,

653
00:41:32,197 --> 00:41:35,993
and I'll tear you to pieces!

654
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,452
See you in Hell.

655
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:43,292
You'll never be forgiven even in death!

656
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:52,301
Sun!

657
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,260
My poor sister!

658
00:41:53,343 --> 00:41:55,137
Sun!

659
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,430
Mom.

660
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,438
Ms. Lim left, and you're leaving too.

661
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,107
I'll be all alone here.

662
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,276
I'll make a recommendation
for you when I get there.

663
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:11,737
Why would you do that?

664
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:14,573
Mr. Gye.

665
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:20,078
You did a great job.

666
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:21,663
Thank you, sir.

667
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:24,583
Hearing that you're leaving
is so refreshing. I mean…

668
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:26,960
It's sad.

669
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:31,965
For a talented prosecutor like Gye Ji-ung,
he belongs in the big leagues, not here.

670
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,425
For sure.

671
00:42:34,092 --> 00:42:35,093
I'll get going.

672
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,262
All right.

673
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,972
Good work.

674
00:42:41,516 --> 00:42:42,642
No need to see me out.

675
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:52,194
PROSECUTOR GYE JI-UNG

676
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,252
Gosh, that's good!

677
00:43:50,335 --> 00:43:51,169
Here.

678
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,379
- It tastes so good.
- Nice!

679
00:43:52,462 --> 00:43:53,755
- I brought more. Eat up.
- Wow!

680
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,215
Thank you for the food.

681
00:43:55,298 --> 00:43:56,258
It's good.

682
00:43:56,758 --> 00:43:58,718
- By the way, Mi-jin.
- Yes?

683
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:02,681
I hear you're quitting
your environmental public service job.

684
00:44:03,306 --> 00:44:04,558
What are you going to do now?

685
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:10,105
Dad, do you want to be dragged out again?

686
00:44:11,606 --> 00:44:12,816
- Eat up.
- I mean…

687
00:44:12,899 --> 00:44:16,528
What if she tries to prepare
for the civil service exam again?

688
00:44:16,611 --> 00:44:18,488
I just said it since I was worried.

689
00:44:20,657 --> 00:44:22,409
I am going to start again.

690
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:24,661
Start what?

691
00:44:25,203 --> 00:44:26,037
Studying for exams.

692
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:36,089
So you've been going out every night
to study for the civil service exams?

693
00:44:37,048 --> 00:44:39,176
I was going to tell you after I'd passed.

694
00:44:40,051 --> 00:44:42,095
But I don't know when that'll be.

695
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:44,806
Are you crazy?

696
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,100
I'm sick of hearing about civil servants.

697
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:50,437
- Don't even dream of it.
- You wanted me to be a civil servant.

698
00:44:51,521 --> 00:44:54,191
But what I'm studying for
is what I really want to be.

699
00:44:55,942 --> 00:44:58,028
There's something I really want to do.

700
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:01,948
That's why I want to start again

701
00:45:02,782 --> 00:45:03,742
and do it properly.

702
00:45:04,367 --> 00:45:05,911
Even if I fail, I won't regret it.

703
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:07,871
Okay?

704
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:12,709
Goodness.

705
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:25,847
Cheers!

706
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:27,766
Okay!

707
00:45:28,558 --> 00:45:29,768
Yeah, cheers!

708
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:31,561
What's with you all?

709
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:32,479
Come on, Mom!

710
00:45:32,562 --> 00:45:33,897
Don't be like that.

711
00:45:34,564 --> 00:45:36,274
We're missing someone's glass.

712
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:38,777
Jeez. Whatever. I don't care anymore.

713
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:39,736
Jeez!

714
00:45:39,819 --> 00:45:42,447
- Good luck!
- Good luck, Mi-jin!

715
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,370
- How refreshing!
- It's so good!

716
00:45:48,453 --> 00:45:50,288
- I'll do my best.
- You better, you brat.

717
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:51,706
Don't worry, okay?

718
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,125
- Take some meat when you go.
- Mom, wrap this for me.

719
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:56,044
Don't be ridiculous!

720
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:58,546
But your shop gave away pork shoulder!

721
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:02,133
- Jeez! You're drunk!
- Gosh, be quiet!

722
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:06,179
- I think your dad needs to go home.
- Dad.

723
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,180
Come on, Dad.

724
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,140
I've already had three shots.

725
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:37,062
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

726
00:47:37,645 --> 00:47:39,481
Okay, you may now begin your work.

727
00:47:39,564 --> 00:47:41,900
If you have questions, ask your superiors.

728
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:44,569
Good luck.

729
00:47:44,652 --> 00:47:46,905
- Have a nice day, ma'am.
- Have a good day.

730
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:50,116
Let's see here.

731
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,243
It looks like everyone's in uniform.

732
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:53,828
- So follow me.
- Okay.

733
00:47:54,579 --> 00:47:57,582
I heard a legendary intern
used to be here.

734
00:47:57,665 --> 00:47:59,876
Yes, there was!

735
00:47:59,959 --> 00:48:01,419
The legendary intern!

736
00:48:02,003 --> 00:48:03,963
- Her name was Lim Sun.
- That's right.

737
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,716
- Really?
- She was amazing.

738
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,551
She threw herself into harm's way!

739
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:09,886
She stopped a terrorist attack!

740
00:48:09,969 --> 00:48:13,014
- A terrorist attack?
- She helped catch a serial killer too.

741
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:15,683
- The rumors were true.
- Stop exaggerating.

742
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:16,643
What?

743
00:48:16,726 --> 00:48:18,144
Are you writing a biography?

744
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:21,564
I'm saying there's a reason why
the term "Senior Avengers" exists.

745
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:23,691
Where is she now though?

746
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:24,651
I don't know.

747
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:26,277
I want to know too.

748
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:29,406
I wonder where she is
and what she's doing.

749
00:48:31,157 --> 00:48:33,410
Before resuming activities
after your military service,

750
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:36,162
we wanted to know why
you're releasing a single album first.

751
00:48:37,455 --> 00:48:41,584
I wanted to communicate through my music
rather than show my appearance.

752
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:44,212
I took such a long break,

753
00:48:44,295 --> 00:48:45,880
so I was itching to work again.

754
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:49,426
Your fans are especially interested
in the first track.

755
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:52,220
They want to know if it's based
on a real romantic experience?

756
00:48:52,303 --> 00:48:54,472
The lyrics are so poignant.

757
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:56,391
Ko Won,

758
00:48:57,267 --> 00:49:01,938
having someone as remarkable as you
be my friend and supporter

759
00:49:03,356 --> 00:49:04,441
reassured me so much.

760
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:11,656
But things aren't over between him and me.

761
00:49:15,201 --> 00:49:17,954
I'm trying really hard
to be close to him again.

762
00:49:20,373 --> 00:49:21,207
Well…

763
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,668
I have no comment on that.

764
00:49:27,755 --> 00:49:29,132
I'll keep your secret.

765
00:49:29,215 --> 00:49:30,258
Ma'am…

766
00:49:30,341 --> 00:49:31,885
You kept my secret too.

767
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:34,220
You know too many vitamins
can make you sick too, right?

768
00:49:34,804 --> 00:49:37,265
I'll get you an iced coffee
every morning. Deal?

769
00:49:37,348 --> 00:49:38,349
That's cold!

770
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:40,768
Everything you say is so typical…

771
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:43,813
but it's nice.

772
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:46,649
Thanks for being Ko Won's fan.

773
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:48,902
And I hope you continue to support him.

774
00:49:53,406 --> 00:49:55,074
It's a precious memory

775
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:58,119
I want to keep to myself.

776
00:50:16,379 --> 00:50:17,338
Wow!

777
00:50:17,422 --> 00:50:18,548
It looks so good.

778
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:22,051
If it's for you, I can do anything.

779
00:50:23,428 --> 00:50:25,430
But is today a special day?

780
00:50:26,055 --> 00:50:30,184
I tried so hard to think,
but I have no idea what this day is.

781
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:32,478
To be honest, today…

782
00:50:35,022 --> 00:50:37,525
I'm celebrating
the early repayment of my loan.

783
00:50:38,109 --> 00:50:40,528
So you… paid off all of your debts?

784
00:50:41,112 --> 00:50:42,280
Yes, finally.

785
00:50:42,905 --> 00:50:45,199
You've worked so hard for that.
Congratulations!

786
00:50:47,243 --> 00:50:50,872
So to celebrate the early repayment,
I've prepared something.

787
00:50:50,955 --> 00:50:52,582
- What is it?
- Wait just a moment.

788
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:54,625
Let's see.

789
00:50:54,709 --> 00:50:55,668
Where was it again?

790
00:50:55,752 --> 00:50:56,836
What is it?

791
00:50:56,919 --> 00:50:58,087
What's wrong?

792
00:50:58,171 --> 00:50:59,255
Where is it?

793
00:50:59,964 --> 00:51:00,798
What?

794
00:51:07,805 --> 00:51:09,098
What's this?

795
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,442
What? What's wrong?

796
00:51:20,026 --> 00:51:20,985
What are you doing?

797
00:51:32,538 --> 00:51:35,374
Ga-yeong, please accept this.

798
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:45,510
I can't take it.

799
00:51:46,969 --> 00:51:47,804
I see…

800
00:51:48,721 --> 00:51:50,431
- It's okay.
- So help me put it on.

801
00:51:52,016 --> 00:51:53,100
Do it for me.

802
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:12,662
Wow.

803
00:52:15,581 --> 00:52:16,582
It's so pretty.

804
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:19,043
You're even prettier.

805
00:52:23,464 --> 00:52:24,882
- Can I take a picture?
- Yes.

806
00:52:38,437 --> 00:52:40,523
How's Mi-jin? Is she doing well?

807
00:52:40,606 --> 00:52:41,440
Yes.

808
00:52:41,524 --> 00:52:43,818
She's preparing
for the third round of exams.

809
00:52:43,901 --> 00:52:44,819
Already?

810
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:48,656
Wow, that's incredible.
She passed the first two rounds in one go.

811
00:52:48,739 --> 00:52:50,116
But I'm a little worried.

812
00:52:50,908 --> 00:52:53,452
She always does well and then slips.

813
00:52:54,161 --> 00:52:55,121
How?

814
00:52:55,204 --> 00:52:58,124
On the day before her Grade 7
civil service exam, her appendix burst.

815
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:01,794
She had a car accident the next year,
so she couldn't make it.

816
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:05,089
Everything,
from shingles to kidney stones.

817
00:53:06,382 --> 00:53:08,217
They're all actually stress-related.

818
00:53:08,301 --> 00:53:10,761
It's the pressure of having to pass

819
00:53:11,345 --> 00:53:13,764
and a type of mental anxiety.

820
00:53:18,561 --> 00:53:20,104
But who knows this time?

821
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:22,815
She has a clear goal now.

822
00:53:23,608 --> 00:53:24,775
A goal?

823
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:26,444
Well…

824
00:53:29,071 --> 00:53:31,741
How's Mr. Gye doing?

825
00:53:31,824 --> 00:53:32,783
I see.

826
00:53:32,867 --> 00:53:35,411
Yes, he's the same as always.

827
00:53:35,494 --> 00:53:37,747
They looked so good together.

828
00:53:38,497 --> 00:53:39,498
Just like us.

829
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:42,710
Gosh.

830
00:53:42,793 --> 00:53:43,669
Stop it.

831
00:53:47,173 --> 00:53:50,259
SIX MONTHS LATER

832
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:07,693
You don't feel it?

833
00:54:08,736 --> 00:54:10,071
- Feel what?
- Where was it?

834
00:54:10,154 --> 00:54:11,864
Seohan? Seohyang?

835
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:13,491
- Seohan District?
- Yeah, that's it.

836
00:54:13,574 --> 00:54:16,827
Since returning, you've been persistently
poking your nose in everything.

837
00:54:16,911 --> 00:54:18,454
Working hard at my job is a problem?

838
00:54:18,537 --> 00:54:21,082
No, doing it needlessly well is a problem.

839
00:54:21,749 --> 00:54:23,000
Don't overdo it.

840
00:54:23,084 --> 00:54:25,628
If it's not for personal gain,
you'll be called a sociopath.

841
00:54:31,884 --> 00:54:32,802
Hey, they're here.

842
00:54:33,302 --> 00:54:34,679
This year's top investigator hire.

843
00:54:37,348 --> 00:54:40,559
A new Grade 7 recruit
was assigned to my office.

844
00:54:40,643 --> 00:54:42,186
She's totally my type.

845
00:54:42,269 --> 00:54:43,938
A woman with a sexy mind.

846
00:54:44,855 --> 00:54:46,357
She wrote a statement in five minutes

847
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:50,444
and organized supplies and receipts
in Excel sheets as soon as she came in.

848
00:54:50,528 --> 00:54:51,821
It's like she's done it before.

849
00:54:57,159 --> 00:54:57,994
It's all done.

850
00:54:58,077 --> 00:55:01,288
I'll make a formula that will manage
the supplies efficiently.

851
00:55:02,164 --> 00:55:04,166
There's someone else who's that good?

852
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:05,459
Yeah.

853
00:55:09,213 --> 00:55:10,297
Are there seats?

854
00:55:11,215 --> 00:55:12,717
It's the prosecutor I called dibs on.

855
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:13,718
Incredible, right?

856
00:55:18,973 --> 00:55:20,808
Ms. Lee, over here.

857
00:55:20,891 --> 00:55:21,934
Okay.

858
00:55:23,185 --> 00:55:24,854
Hello.

859
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,796
Take a seat.

860
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:52,214
Okay.

861
00:56:07,772 --> 00:56:09,065
She's incredible.

862
00:56:09,148 --> 00:56:12,193
We studied together before,
and she was hired as a recruit.

863
00:56:12,276 --> 00:56:14,278
She bombed the Grade 9 exam back then.

864
00:56:14,361 --> 00:56:15,738
What are you talking about?

865
00:56:16,572 --> 00:56:18,991
But I'd say that created an opportunity.

866
00:56:19,742 --> 00:56:20,993
Yeah, it did.

867
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:23,662
What are you doing this weekend?

868
00:56:23,746 --> 00:56:26,207
I have tickets to the Coolplay concert.

869
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:27,625
How did you get those?

870
00:56:27,708 --> 00:56:28,876
I really wanted to go.

871
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:30,669
Can you sell them to me?

872
00:56:31,962 --> 00:56:32,797
Want to go with me?

873
00:56:33,714 --> 00:56:35,424
No, I have plans.

874
00:56:35,508 --> 00:56:36,759
What plans?

875
00:56:36,842 --> 00:56:38,594
I'm seeing someone I like.

876
00:56:41,263 --> 00:56:42,765
Do you have a girlfriend?

877
00:56:45,184 --> 00:56:46,185
Do you have a boyfriend?

878
00:56:50,523 --> 00:56:51,357
Me?

879
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:04,829
PROSECUTOR YOON BAK

880
00:57:11,252 --> 00:57:13,003
By any chance, do you like pasta?

881
00:57:14,171 --> 00:57:17,174
Let's end work early today
and go to the new pasta place nearby.

882
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:20,970
I usually try to avoid working late.

883
00:57:22,763 --> 00:57:25,057
How is eating dinner
the same as working late?

884
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:26,392
That hurts my feelings.

885
00:57:35,025 --> 00:57:37,653
I bought the concert tickets.
Want to go with me?

886
00:57:39,405 --> 00:57:41,824
I usually try to avoid
working on weekends.

887
00:57:42,408 --> 00:57:43,826
You're so funny.

888
00:57:43,909 --> 00:57:45,161
Working on weekends?

889
00:57:45,244 --> 00:57:46,912
I'm asking you out on a date.

890
00:57:48,205 --> 00:57:51,000
I usually try to avoid dating coworkers.

891
00:57:52,835 --> 00:57:54,503
Then, what am I supposed to do?

892
00:57:54,587 --> 00:57:57,590
I usually don't pay premiums
on concert tickets,

893
00:57:57,673 --> 00:57:59,008
but I made an exception--

894
00:57:59,091 --> 00:58:01,886
You didn't really pay a premium, did you?

895
00:58:01,969 --> 00:58:05,097
Is one of our nation's prosecutors
violating the Minor Offenses Act?

896
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:06,599
And did I just witness that?

897
00:58:07,516 --> 00:58:09,435
I can't report a colleague though.

898
00:58:09,518 --> 00:58:11,228
- What should I do?
- Stop it.

899
00:58:11,312 --> 00:58:14,315
You should be leading by example,
not scalping tickets.

900
00:58:14,398 --> 00:58:17,193
Our department head will…
Wait, was that the reason?

901
00:58:17,276 --> 00:58:18,402
He asked for you.

902
00:58:18,486 --> 00:58:19,487
- You should go.
- Hey!

903
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:21,489
Why are you telling me this now? Jeez!

904
00:58:23,574 --> 00:58:25,159
Because I just got here.

905
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:27,828
What's Coolplay anyway?

906
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:40,508
Did you need something?

907
00:58:43,177 --> 00:58:45,137
No, not really.

908
00:58:46,514 --> 00:58:48,015
I was curious about something.

909
00:58:48,098 --> 00:58:49,767
Why do you hate dating coworkers?

910
00:58:51,435 --> 00:58:53,103
I never said I hated it.

911
00:58:53,771 --> 00:58:55,648
You just said you hated dating coworkers.

912
00:58:55,731 --> 00:58:58,859
Yes, because he asked me,

913
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:01,195
but it depends on who is asking.

914
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:03,614
Right?

915
00:59:03,697 --> 00:59:06,867
So you were just turning him down, right?

916
00:59:07,451 --> 00:59:08,494
I mean…

917
00:59:08,577 --> 00:59:10,079
To be honest,

918
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,206
it's been so long…

919
00:59:16,043 --> 00:59:17,253
- My gosh!
- My hand!

920
00:59:17,336 --> 00:59:19,547
Why would you touch that?

921
00:59:23,551 --> 00:59:25,135
- Does it really hurt?
- Yes.

922
00:59:25,219 --> 00:59:26,720
- Should I stop?
- No, it's fine.

923
00:59:27,471 --> 00:59:29,390
Gosh, what if this leaves a scar?

924
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:32,434
Why did you pretend
to not know me back there?

925
00:59:33,686 --> 00:59:35,563
Because you did it first.

926
00:59:40,234 --> 00:59:43,279
It's not because you have a boyfriend
and felt uncomfortable, is it?

927
00:59:43,362 --> 00:59:44,947
I said I had a boyfriend?

928
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:46,115
You didn't say you didn't.

929
00:59:49,577 --> 00:59:51,996
But you said there's someone you like.

930
00:59:52,955 --> 00:59:53,831
I do.

931
00:59:57,293 --> 00:59:58,377
She's right in front of me.

932
01:00:06,594 --> 01:00:08,220
- I don't have one.
- What?

933
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:11,432
I don't have a boyfriend.

934
01:00:16,312 --> 01:00:18,522
People will look!
What if someone sees us?

935
01:00:18,606 --> 01:00:20,316
Who cares? No one's around.

936
01:00:23,861 --> 01:00:25,779
Do you know how hard it's been for me?

937
01:00:27,531 --> 01:00:29,408
Do you know how long I waited?

938
01:00:31,076 --> 01:00:32,536
I missed you so much.

939
01:00:33,662 --> 01:00:34,705
I really did.

940
01:01:03,942 --> 01:01:06,570
Tomorrow's Saturday.
Should we go on a date at night?

941
01:01:07,154 --> 01:01:08,447
Why at night?

942
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:09,990
We can't meet during the day.

943
01:01:10,824 --> 01:01:12,201
It's daytime right now.

944
01:01:12,284 --> 01:01:14,745
- You're right!
- What's with you?

945
01:01:14,828 --> 01:01:16,121
What happened?

946
01:01:16,205 --> 01:01:18,290
We can see each other during the day now?

947
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:19,625
It just happened.

948
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:22,127
But how? All of a sudden?

949
01:01:22,836 --> 01:01:24,463
I know. It was sudden.

950
01:01:25,464 --> 01:01:27,174
For no reason at all?

951
01:01:28,634 --> 01:01:30,010
Mr. Gye!

952
01:01:52,491 --> 01:01:53,492
What was that?

953
01:01:54,118 --> 01:01:55,160
Did you hear that?

954
01:01:57,871 --> 01:01:59,873
No, I didn't hear anything.

955
01:01:59,957 --> 01:02:01,458
What did you hear?

956
01:02:01,542 --> 01:02:03,335
It looks like you heard something too.

957
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:04,670
I didn't hear anything.

958
01:02:04,753 --> 01:02:07,548
- Are you okay? Are you hearing things?
- How strange.

959
01:02:11,635 --> 01:02:13,595
Gosh, the weather's so nice.

960
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:14,680
It really is nice.

961
01:02:16,056 --> 01:02:17,057
What's nice?

962
01:02:40,914 --> 01:02:44,084
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

963
01:03:05,939 --> 01:03:07,816
SPECIAL THANKS TO YOON BAK

964
01:03:41,391 --> 01:03:46,021
