Come on!

8
00:00:22,427 --> 00:00:24,596
Why aren't you drinking?

9
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:27,223
To be honest, I don't feel well.

10
00:00:27,307 --> 00:00:29,726
I don't feel well either!

11
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:30,810
Just one sip.

12
00:00:34,397 --> 00:00:36,316
Okay? Let's cheers.

13
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,485
- All right?
- Excuse me. Who are you?

14
00:00:38,568 --> 00:00:39,611
Just a second.

15
00:00:39,694 --> 00:00:40,945
Who are you?

16
00:00:41,029 --> 00:00:41,863
I'm Lee Mi-jin.

17
00:00:41,946 --> 00:00:42,946
Are you kidding me?

18
00:00:47,452 --> 00:00:48,495
Don't drink it.

19
00:00:49,954 --> 00:00:52,540
Hurry and take a sip. Cheers.

20
00:00:52,624 --> 00:00:53,792
Okay.

21
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,381
Hurry and drink it.

22
00:01:00,382 --> 00:01:01,382
Cheers! Okay?

23
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:02,759
Cheers!

24
00:01:02,842 --> 00:01:04,427
She did this, and if you drink it…

25
00:01:04,511 --> 00:01:06,179
You'll become like this.

26
00:01:07,722 --> 00:01:08,807
Does your neck hurt?

27
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,767
- No, I'm fine.
- Cheers.

28
00:01:12,936 --> 00:01:14,187
Just one sip.

29
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,441
She did this.

30
00:01:18,525 --> 00:01:20,443
Dizzy. No, don't.

31
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:23,196
- What do you keep looking at?
- No, wait… Cheers.

32
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,243
It's bottoms up. You have to finish it.

33
00:01:28,868 --> 00:01:29,868
Okay.

34
00:01:36,835 --> 00:01:38,211
No!

35
00:01:48,513 --> 00:01:49,681
Hey. Excuse me.

36
00:02:02,152 --> 00:02:03,194
Babe!

37
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,822
- "Babe"?
- "Babe"?

38
00:02:06,614 --> 00:02:08,616
Are you cheating on me again?

39
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,700
He must've cheated.

40
00:02:10,452 --> 00:02:12,328
He is pretty handsome though.

41
00:02:16,374 --> 00:02:17,667
Who's this woman?

42
00:02:17,751 --> 00:02:18,751
Who are you?

43
00:02:19,335 --> 00:02:20,335
Who is she?

44
00:02:22,338 --> 00:02:25,508
- I can explain...
- Is she your girlfriend?

45
00:02:26,342 --> 00:02:27,594
No, she's...

46
00:02:27,677 --> 00:02:29,304
Yeah, I'm his girlfriend! So?

47
00:02:31,764 --> 00:02:33,558
It doesn't matter if he's taken.

48
00:02:36,394 --> 00:02:37,812
Who will it be? Choose.

49
00:02:37,896 --> 00:02:39,689
- Excuse me?
- Will it be that bitch or me?

50
00:02:39,772 --> 00:02:41,065
"Bitch"?

51
00:02:41,149 --> 00:02:42,400
No, wait…

52
00:02:42,484 --> 00:02:44,569
He's my boyfriend! Back off!

53
00:02:44,652 --> 00:02:46,446
What's wrong with you?

54
00:02:46,529 --> 00:02:48,865
Wow, you're strong as hell! He's mine!

55
00:02:48,948 --> 00:02:50,325
Starting today, he's mine!

56
00:02:50,408 --> 00:02:51,993
He's my boyfriend, damn it!

57
00:02:52,076 --> 00:02:53,912
Starting today, he's mine!

58
00:02:53,995 --> 00:02:55,872
Jeez, she's too strong.

59
00:02:55,955 --> 00:02:56,789
Hold on.

60
00:02:56,873 --> 00:02:57,790
Why are you so strong?

61
00:02:57,874 --> 00:03:00,335
- Stop! That's enough!
- Okay!

62
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,215
Let's not do this and take it outside.
I mean, let's talk outside.

63
00:03:05,965 --> 00:03:07,133
Goodness!

64
00:03:07,217 --> 00:03:08,593
- Poppy!
- Who is it?

65
00:03:08,676 --> 00:03:10,553
- Who is it?
- What are you doing here?

66
00:03:10,637 --> 00:03:12,263
Who keeps hitting on you?

67
00:03:13,348 --> 00:03:14,348
It's not like that.

68
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,558
Is it this punk?

69
00:03:15,642 --> 00:03:16,893
You're dead today!

70
00:03:19,437 --> 00:03:20,605
This little bastard…

71
00:03:23,691 --> 00:03:25,235
- What are you doing here?
- Mr. Gye.

72
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:26,319
Are you a prosecutor?

73
00:03:27,111 --> 00:03:28,696
- What's wrong?
- A prosecutor!

74
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,990
- He's a prosecutor! Run!
- Hey! You jerk!

75
00:03:33,284 --> 00:03:34,284
Hey!

76
00:03:35,203 --> 00:03:36,371
You can't go.

77
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,500
- Just come peacefully.
- Gosh.

78
00:03:41,626 --> 00:03:43,044
- Well?
- It's not what you think.

79
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:45,672
I borrowed this bike.

80
00:03:46,589 --> 00:03:48,383
Okay, I'll come with you.

81
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:51,970
- Let's go.
- Fine.

82
00:03:53,054 --> 00:03:54,973
What? Stop right there!

83
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,070
Damn it.

84
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:15,952
Safe.

85
00:04:17,912 --> 00:04:18,997
- Don't move!
- Who are you?

86
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,320
- Stop messing around!
- Let go!

87
00:04:20,373 --> 00:04:21,373
- So strong…
- Let go!

88
00:04:24,544 --> 00:04:25,544
Investigator Ju, hurry!

89
00:04:25,587 --> 00:04:26,462
- Hey!
- Hurry up!

90
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:28,673
I'm coming! Careful! Thank you.

91
00:04:29,382 --> 00:04:30,758
- Stop moving!
- Let go!

92
00:04:30,842 --> 00:04:32,635
But how did you know
I was an investigator?

93
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:36,556
Mr. Gye told me. Like he said,
you looked so competent.

94
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,808
- I wonder what else he said. Stop!
- Let go, bastard!

95
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:41,519
The office couldn't run without me!

96
00:04:41,603 --> 00:04:43,646
Are you okay? Nope, you're not.

97
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,982
- It's not okay!
- Stop moving!

98
00:04:46,065 --> 00:04:48,526
Do you know how much trouble
you've caused me today?

99
00:04:49,193 --> 00:04:50,945
There's been a misunderstanding.

100
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:52,322
Just come peacefully.

101
00:04:57,785 --> 00:04:59,579
Holy cow!

102
00:05:00,204 --> 00:05:01,331
That was a sick kick!

103
00:05:01,414 --> 00:05:03,249
You're the one who started this.

104
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,333
Wow.

105
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:06,127
Come here.

106
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,503
Damn it!

107
00:05:14,135 --> 00:05:15,928
They just don't listen.

108
00:05:16,012 --> 00:05:17,805
Wait! My back!

109
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:19,641
That hurts, sir!

110
00:05:19,724 --> 00:05:21,434
That hurts!

111
00:05:21,517 --> 00:05:24,270
- Don't be a crybaby.
- That hurts! Damn it!

112
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:26,397
Why are you so strong?

113
00:05:31,444 --> 00:05:32,820
Just as before,

114
00:05:32,904 --> 00:05:35,823
we keep running into each other
during critical situations.

115
00:05:36,407 --> 00:05:37,407
Right.

116
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,036
It's fate to meet like this again.
Should we introduce ourselves?

117
00:05:40,662 --> 00:05:43,039
Sure. I'm Lee Mi-jin.

118
00:05:43,748 --> 00:05:46,042
I'm Ju Byeong-deok.
Mr. Gye can't work without me.

119
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,752
I'm like his right-hand man.

120
00:05:48,211 --> 00:05:50,129
The way you broke your fall was great.

121
00:05:50,713 --> 00:05:53,049
- I'm constantly training.
- I see. Special training...

122
00:05:53,132 --> 00:05:54,634
- Come here!
- Be careful.

123
00:05:55,593 --> 00:05:56,469
Jeez.

124
00:05:56,552 --> 00:05:57,804
Watch your head.

125
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,930
Mr. Gye.

126
00:05:59,681 --> 00:06:01,766
I'll see you at the office then.

127
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:03,559
Okay, great job tonight.

128
00:06:03,643 --> 00:06:05,144
Hey!

129
00:06:05,228 --> 00:06:08,481
- It's not what you think!
- How could you? You jerk!

130
00:06:08,564 --> 00:06:11,275
This is all your fault! Look at this!

131
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:12,694
- Damn it!
- Quiet!

132
00:06:13,361 --> 00:06:14,696
Damn it.

133
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,117
What happened back there?

134
00:06:20,034 --> 00:06:21,034
What?

135
00:06:21,452 --> 00:06:22,745
What were you doing here?

136
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:25,038
I came to eat chicken.

137
00:06:25,665 --> 00:06:27,917
If so, then why did you throw it?

138
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,046
That woman earlier seemed strange to me.

139
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,174
Who knows? She might've spiked your drink.

140
00:06:35,258 --> 00:06:38,428
Is that why you made up
that ridiculous act earlier?

141
00:06:40,763 --> 00:06:42,557
You know this is really suspicious, right?

142
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,059
We met at the club last time
and here tonight.

143
00:06:46,394 --> 00:06:49,814
Wait, you can't possibly think
I'm stalking you or something, do you?

144
00:06:49,897 --> 00:06:51,607
Maybe that could be better.

145
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,901
What does that mean?

146
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:56,612
By any chance…

147
00:06:59,741 --> 00:07:00,741
Never mind.

148
00:07:02,243 --> 00:07:04,954
What is it? It looks like you have
something to ask.

149
00:07:08,374 --> 00:07:11,210
I heard you got a job
right after you were scammed.

150
00:07:11,294 --> 00:07:12,295
What do you do now?

151
00:07:14,922 --> 00:07:15,922
Why do you ask?

152
00:07:19,844 --> 00:07:22,263
I got a job. You really don't believe me?

153
00:07:22,346 --> 00:07:24,599
So tell me what you do then.

154
00:07:24,682 --> 00:07:25,808
Where do you work?

155
00:07:26,392 --> 00:07:29,562
<i>At Seohan District Prosecutors' Office,
in your damn office.</i>

156
00:07:29,645 --> 00:07:32,732
Are you embarrassed to tell me?

157
00:07:32,815 --> 00:07:34,192
Or is it something else?

158
00:07:43,493 --> 00:07:45,411
<i>The next bus will arrive soon.</i>

159
00:07:50,124 --> 00:07:53,544
If the lie is only for your sake,
is it still considered a white lie?

160
00:07:54,128 --> 00:07:58,091
Either way, I believe the truth
will always be eventually revealed,

161
00:07:58,174 --> 00:07:59,759
one way or another.

162
00:08:02,595 --> 00:08:05,014
<i>I don't even get thanked for helping.</i>

163
00:08:05,973 --> 00:08:07,975
<i>And I get treated like a weirdo instead.</i>

164
00:08:08,434 --> 00:08:09,894
<i>But it's true. I am a weirdo.</i>

165
00:08:48,307 --> 00:08:50,226
It's late. Why is she walking instead?

166
00:08:52,478 --> 00:08:54,730
He wouldn't believe me even if I told him.

167
00:08:54,814 --> 00:08:56,774
It's not like I don't want to tell him.

168
00:08:56,858 --> 00:08:59,443
I can't tell him,
because I have my reasons.

169
00:08:59,527 --> 00:09:00,570
And what about him?

170
00:09:00,653 --> 00:09:03,906
If I ask why he doesn't trust cops,
would he tell me the truth?

171
00:09:04,532 --> 00:09:05,533
He wouldn't.

172
00:09:06,784 --> 00:09:09,495
In case it would make him uncomfortable…

173
00:09:11,038 --> 00:09:12,832
or if it was a heartbreaking story,

174
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:16,586
I purposely didn't ask
despite being curious.

175
00:09:17,503 --> 00:09:20,590
For a prosecutor, why is he so dense?

176
00:09:20,673 --> 00:09:22,133
If I hadn't thrown that drumstick

177
00:09:22,216 --> 00:09:25,261
and he drank that beer,
who knows what would've happened to him?

178
00:09:26,804 --> 00:09:30,433
He should know to be careful
if a woman clearly looks suspicious.

179
00:09:31,017 --> 00:09:34,270
How could he accept
every drink offered to him like a fool?

180
00:09:35,688 --> 00:09:37,398
He doesn't even know I helped him.

181
00:09:37,481 --> 00:09:40,067
All he did was glare and question me.

182
00:09:40,151 --> 00:09:41,194
What a jerk.

183
00:09:42,361 --> 00:09:44,488
He's a jerk,

184
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:46,616
but he's not wrong either.

185
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:48,868
Whatever. This sucks.

186
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:56,834
What the hell?

187
00:09:57,418 --> 00:09:58,920
I'm sorry, sir.

188
00:10:00,546 --> 00:10:01,839
What the hell?

189
00:10:01,923 --> 00:10:03,132
Who are you?

190
00:10:03,216 --> 00:10:05,760
I was aiming for the trash
but hit you by accident.

191
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,971
Does my head
look like a trash can, you punk?

192
00:10:09,055 --> 00:10:10,139
I'm sorry.

193
00:10:10,223 --> 00:10:12,433
You punk, you know who I am?

194
00:10:12,516 --> 00:10:14,477
I'll tell you!

195
00:10:14,936 --> 00:10:17,355
During my non-active military service
in Seohan,

196
00:10:17,438 --> 00:10:19,523
I had meals with the chief. Did you know?

197
00:10:19,607 --> 00:10:21,609
We even played table tennis, all right?

198
00:10:21,692 --> 00:10:24,403
We did it all, you punk. Rotten punk.

199
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:30,659
Forget it.

200
00:10:32,536 --> 00:10:33,955
Give me your number.

201
00:10:34,538 --> 00:10:36,040
I'll give you my card.

202
00:10:36,123 --> 00:10:37,541
Not yours.

203
00:10:40,086 --> 00:10:42,171
What's this? Your last name is "Gye"?

204
00:10:44,382 --> 00:10:47,593
"Gye Ji-ung"?

205
00:10:47,677 --> 00:10:48,928
PROSECUTOR GYE JI-UNG

206
00:10:49,011 --> 00:10:51,472
You're… a prosecutor.

207
00:10:53,683 --> 00:10:54,683
I'm sorry.

208
00:10:55,351 --> 00:10:58,270
- How's your head?
- It's fine. I'm sorry.

209
00:10:59,772 --> 00:11:02,566
Have a great night.

210
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,235
Good night!

211
00:11:04,318 --> 00:11:06,696
- Thank you.
- Take care. I'm sorry.

212
00:11:10,908 --> 00:11:12,827
You can't kick a can like that.

213
00:11:13,869 --> 00:11:16,414
- How long have you been here for?
- I don't know.

214
00:11:16,497 --> 00:11:18,958
- Since when you called me a jerk?
- I see.

215
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:22,128
No, maybe it was when you said
you threw the drumstick.

216
00:11:23,254 --> 00:11:24,338
I see.

217
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:26,799
Why didn't you tell me?

218
00:11:31,178 --> 00:11:32,722
I thought you'd misunderstand.

219
00:11:33,806 --> 00:11:36,475
Sometimes, not saying things
can lead to misunderstandings.

220
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,020
Still,

221
00:11:41,105 --> 00:11:42,857
everyone has their own reasons.

222
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:48,279
I'll wait until you can tell me.

223
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:56,870
What about you?

224
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:01,625
If I wait for you,

225
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:04,003
do you think you could tell me
everything too?

226
00:12:06,672 --> 00:12:08,174
I don't know. I've never been…

227
00:12:10,426 --> 00:12:12,595
the type to open up like that.

228
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,018
But I think I might be able to tell you.

229
00:12:20,895 --> 00:12:22,354
I don't know when that'll be though.

230
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:26,108
I'll wait for you.

231
00:12:26,734 --> 00:12:27,777
I can wait.

232
00:12:33,157 --> 00:12:34,325
I mean it.

233
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,413
Let's go now. It's late.

234
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,256
I'm home.

235
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,424
- Hey.
- Welcome back.

236
00:12:50,508 --> 00:12:51,508
Hey.

237
00:12:51,884 --> 00:12:53,844
- Come sit and have some fruit.
- Yeah.

238
00:12:57,264 --> 00:12:59,391
<i>However, next to him</i>

239
00:12:59,475 --> 00:13:01,936
<i>is another male goose
who is attracted</i>

240
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:03,771
<i>to the same female goose.</i>

241
00:13:04,355 --> 00:13:05,356
Here.

242
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:07,983
<i>When a goose picks a mate…</i>

243
00:13:08,067 --> 00:13:09,067
Mi-jin?

244
00:13:11,112 --> 00:13:12,238
Lee Mi-jin?

245
00:13:13,072 --> 00:13:14,990
Why are you laughing like that?

246
00:13:15,074 --> 00:13:16,867
- What?
- Have you been drinking?

247
00:13:16,951 --> 00:13:19,120
I wasn't drinking. Why would I?

248
00:13:19,203 --> 00:13:21,080
Judging by these mood swings,

249
00:13:21,163 --> 00:13:23,332
did you take
your mom's menopausal medicine?

250
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:24,875
What are you saying?

251
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,585
- I didn't take it.
- I'm joking!

252
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,547
Come on.

253
00:13:33,968 --> 00:13:36,762
- By the way, Mom and Dad…
- Yes?

254
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:40,182
If someone says they could only tell me

255
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:43,352
something they couldn't tell anyone else,
what does that mean?

256
00:13:43,435 --> 00:13:45,396
Who said that? Mr. Gye?

257
00:13:46,021 --> 00:13:47,523
What did he say? When?

258
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,359
He can tell you
because that's how much he trusts you.

259
00:13:51,485 --> 00:13:54,405
It means he trusts you.
He thinks of you on his side.

260
00:13:54,488 --> 00:13:57,116
Yeah, it's solid trust.

261
00:14:00,411 --> 00:14:03,789
Seriously, Dad. You're so sensitive.

262
00:14:05,082 --> 00:14:06,083
What about me?

263
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,919
You know how to kill the mood, Mom.

264
00:14:09,712 --> 00:14:11,505
I'm so tired. I'm full.

265
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:12,631
I did what?

266
00:14:13,883 --> 00:14:14,967
You brat!

267
00:14:16,927 --> 00:14:18,679
Honey, did I kill the mood?

268
00:14:18,762 --> 00:14:19,638
No.

269
00:14:19,722 --> 00:14:20,806
- Nonsense, right?
- No.

270
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:21,974
You brat!

271
00:14:22,057 --> 00:14:24,101
Your dad said I didn't kill the mood!

272
00:14:24,185 --> 00:14:25,644
She's so dense though.

273
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,648
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

274
00:14:38,908 --> 00:14:40,826
So what happened with that woman?

275
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,582
What's going on with you two?

276
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:56,425
You're as cold as ice, but if you
took her home, it means you're very close.

277
00:14:57,426 --> 00:14:58,469
Goodness!

278
00:14:59,136 --> 00:15:00,387
Are you okay?

279
00:15:01,305 --> 00:15:03,557
I was so caught up
in your fun conversation.

280
00:15:03,641 --> 00:15:05,893
Jeez, so you like these kinds of stories?

281
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:09,480
Look how happy he seems.
You're in a relationship, right?

282
00:15:09,563 --> 00:15:12,399
What are you talking about?
When did I ever look unhappy?

283
00:15:14,401 --> 00:15:15,945
You can just whisper it to me.

284
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:17,655
Is she your girlfriend? Or a fling?

285
00:15:17,738 --> 00:15:18,989
Get to work, please.

286
00:15:24,495 --> 00:15:27,748
This is because the oxytocin
is surging through him.

287
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:31,168
Have you ever seen
the women he's dated before?

288
00:15:31,252 --> 00:15:32,711
Women?

289
00:15:32,795 --> 00:15:36,131
Other than female suspects, victims,
or ex-cons, there haven't been any.

290
00:15:36,215 --> 00:15:38,717
He lives a very dull and dreary life.

291
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:58,904
Good morning.

292
00:16:09,915 --> 00:16:13,085
Among the trash, I'm the bottom
of the barrel. I'm a nobody.

293
00:16:13,168 --> 00:16:15,087
There's someone else who's in charge!

294
00:16:15,796 --> 00:16:19,174
You're not even in charge,
but you gave drugs to minors without fear?

295
00:16:20,217 --> 00:16:22,469
I was just giving them a little taste…

296
00:16:23,262 --> 00:16:25,764
Why don't you set up
a free sample stand too then?

297
00:16:25,848 --> 00:16:28,267
Damn it, I'm going to go insane!

298
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,602
It's too early for that.

299
00:16:29,685 --> 00:16:32,313
Two prior drug convictions
and a statement

300
00:16:32,396 --> 00:16:35,107
that says you gave drugs
to minors while on probation.

301
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,026
It'll be hard to avoid severe punishment.

302
00:16:37,109 --> 00:16:39,069
It really wasn't me!

303
00:16:39,862 --> 00:16:41,530
Don't shout.

304
00:16:47,995 --> 00:16:48,996
Okay.

305
00:16:50,164 --> 00:16:51,290
Then, how about this?

306
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,918
We won't detain you
if you disclose the supplier.

307
00:16:56,253 --> 00:16:58,297
Your girlfriend didn't have any priors.

308
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,799
Her life could be ruined
for meeting the wrong guy.

309
00:17:01,383 --> 00:17:03,927
You don't want her
to resent you forever, do you?

310
00:17:04,011 --> 00:17:05,679
Don't touch my girlfriend.

311
00:17:05,763 --> 00:17:07,473
She has nothing to do with this.

312
00:17:07,556 --> 00:17:09,975
We caught her at the scene.
What do you take us for?

313
00:17:12,645 --> 00:17:13,729
But who knows?

314
00:17:14,396 --> 00:17:17,900
If I write up this report neatly,
it could end in a dismissal, right?

315
00:17:18,484 --> 00:17:19,485
Of course.

316
00:17:20,027 --> 00:17:22,404
He's known for writing them very neatly.

317
00:17:33,165 --> 00:17:35,000
Excuse me, sir?

318
00:17:35,668 --> 00:17:39,129
I receive the patches
once or twice a week,

319
00:17:39,213 --> 00:17:40,464
and I only deliver them.

320
00:17:41,215 --> 00:17:43,717
Sometimes, I would pocket a few

321
00:17:44,301 --> 00:17:45,844
and used the money for dates.

322
00:17:45,928 --> 00:17:48,222
I only took a few. That's it.

323
00:17:48,847 --> 00:17:50,391
And the delivery method?

324
00:17:50,474 --> 00:17:51,684
Who, when, and how?

325
00:17:51,767 --> 00:17:54,478
When the people who book
on the dark web come to the club,

326
00:17:54,561 --> 00:17:56,730
we put it all together with drinks

327
00:17:56,814 --> 00:17:58,857
and deliver it to their rooms.

328
00:17:58,941 --> 00:18:00,067
But it's not just alcohol.

329
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,694
Come on. Of course, it's not.

330
00:18:01,777 --> 00:18:03,904
We pick a few pretty girls,

331
00:18:04,613 --> 00:18:06,031
and we send them in too.

332
00:18:06,115 --> 00:18:09,868
So these unsuspecting young girls
who are picked up by the wrong guys

333
00:18:09,952 --> 00:18:11,745
have their drinks spiked and are molested?

334
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:13,747
Well, I don't know all that.

335
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:16,083
- They're the ones who...
- You little punk.

336
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,251
- You little…
- Wait, don't.

337
00:18:18,085 --> 00:18:19,086
Hold on.

338
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:20,504
Request an arrest warrant.

339
00:18:20,587 --> 00:18:21,964
You said I wouldn't be detained.

340
00:18:24,758 --> 00:18:27,052
You should've told us something useful.

341
00:18:27,136 --> 00:18:28,262
- But...
- Don't worry.

342
00:18:28,345 --> 00:18:30,723
I'll write exactly
what you both did in the report

343
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,766
for harsher punishment too.

344
00:18:35,018 --> 00:18:36,353
Wait, sir!

345
00:18:36,979 --> 00:18:38,105
Hey! Wait!

346
00:18:38,188 --> 00:18:39,606
Wait! Hey!

347
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,442
Hold on. That's not what you said!

348
00:18:42,192 --> 00:18:43,110
Wait!

349
00:18:43,193 --> 00:18:45,237
That hurts!

350
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,699
The club guys will start to move
if they hear an arrest was made.

351
00:18:48,782 --> 00:18:51,076
Shouldn't we retrieve the drugs
before arresting them?

352
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,828
There are too many to retrieve.

353
00:18:52,911 --> 00:18:55,914
Seeing as how those kids had them,
they were spread intentionally.

354
00:18:56,415 --> 00:18:58,667
If we follow the trail,
it'll lead to the supplier.

355
00:18:59,293 --> 00:19:01,628
I have them on my radar,
so I'll check often.

356
00:19:05,924 --> 00:19:06,924
Hello, boss.

357
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:09,511
We took care of the goods. Don't worry.

358
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:12,848
They won't be able to connect us.

359
00:19:12,931 --> 00:19:14,600
We can cut all the loose ends.

360
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:16,560
So I was thinking,

361
00:19:16,643 --> 00:19:18,353
if you just held onto the goods…

362
00:19:20,773 --> 00:19:21,773
Damn it.

363
00:19:22,274 --> 00:19:23,358
Where should I send them?

364
00:19:23,442 --> 00:19:25,402
It's best to bury them.

365
00:19:26,695 --> 00:19:28,530
Let's go to Obongsan Mountain!

366
00:19:28,614 --> 00:19:29,615
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

367
00:19:29,698 --> 00:19:31,366
PRINCE

368
00:19:38,707 --> 00:19:40,793
- What are you doing?
- What?

369
00:19:40,876 --> 00:19:41,876
Me?

370
00:19:42,878 --> 00:19:44,630
- I was taking out the trash.
- Damn it.

371
00:19:44,713 --> 00:19:46,131
Dump it and get lost!

372
00:19:46,215 --> 00:19:47,216
Yes, boss!

373
00:19:56,767 --> 00:19:57,767
What do I do?

374
00:20:02,147 --> 00:20:03,357
- Yeah?
<i>- Hello?</i>

375
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,400
- They're quickly moving the goods.
- To where?

376
00:20:05,484 --> 00:20:07,361
- I don't know that.
- You don't?

377
00:20:08,111 --> 00:20:11,365
- You punk...
- Well, they said they'd bury them.

378
00:20:11,448 --> 00:20:14,368
Do your job properly, you punk.
Get it together. Find out quickly.

379
00:20:15,536 --> 00:20:18,664
Don't think of running either.
I'll chase you down.

380
00:20:22,793 --> 00:20:24,127
Man, I'd like to hit him.

381
00:20:24,211 --> 00:20:25,504
That punk.

382
00:20:29,383 --> 00:20:30,383
Ms. Lim.

383
00:20:30,425 --> 00:20:32,261
- Just take these.
- Okay.

384
00:20:32,344 --> 00:20:33,637
I don't think I need the cart.

385
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,138
- Okay.
- I can just take them.

386
00:20:38,308 --> 00:20:39,308
Thank you.

387
00:20:40,644 --> 00:20:41,644
Ms. Seo Sun-deok?

388
00:20:42,187 --> 00:20:43,188
Yes.

389
00:20:52,823 --> 00:20:53,823
Lim Sun!

390
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,498
Don't you remember me?

391
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,001
I'm not sure.

392
00:21:04,084 --> 00:21:06,044
I'm Seo Sun-deok from Seohan Bank.

393
00:21:06,128 --> 00:21:08,297
We worked together at the Myeongil branch.

394
00:21:09,673 --> 00:21:11,383
I think you have the wrong person.

395
00:21:13,135 --> 00:21:14,386
I'm so sorry.

396
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,597
You look just like Lim Sun.

397
00:21:17,764 --> 00:21:19,182
I'm sorry.

398
00:21:19,266 --> 00:21:23,562
I thought you were a friend I used to
work with at the bank. I'm sorry.

399
00:21:24,187 --> 00:21:26,356
No, it's fine.

400
00:21:27,274 --> 00:21:28,692
- Have a good day.
- You too.

401
00:21:32,195 --> 00:21:33,739
That's definitely Lim Sun.

402
00:22:09,816 --> 00:22:13,236
LIM SUN? OLD LADY
A WOMAN IN HER TWENTIES?

403
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,410
This is Seohan District
Prosecutors' Office.

404
00:22:21,203 --> 00:22:22,621
Yes, I'll transfer you.

405
00:22:22,704 --> 00:22:26,041
CIVIL COMPLAINTS DEPARTMENT

406
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,760
Won, you have a call.

407
00:22:38,011 --> 00:22:39,096
Won?

408
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:40,930
Yes?

409
00:22:41,682 --> 00:22:42,683
The phone.

410
00:22:43,308 --> 00:22:44,351
Right.

411
00:22:46,812 --> 00:22:49,064
This is Seohan District
Prosecutors' Office.

412
00:22:49,147 --> 00:22:52,401
All of it was done,
so all these people came and…

413
00:22:53,276 --> 00:22:54,611
The deputy chief has arrived.

414
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:55,904
Hello, sir.

415
00:22:55,987 --> 00:22:57,572
Hello. Thank you for your work.

416
00:22:58,198 --> 00:22:59,658
- Take a seat.
- Yes, sir.

417
00:23:02,035 --> 00:23:04,246
- Make yourself comfortable.
- We are, sir.

418
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,834
Our new intern, Baek Cheol-gyu,

419
00:23:08,917 --> 00:23:11,128
wants to treat everyone
to a company dinner.

420
00:23:11,753 --> 00:23:14,047
We'll have the dinner tomorrow night.

421
00:23:14,548 --> 00:23:17,968
We expected nothing less
from a local pillar.

422
00:23:18,051 --> 00:23:19,344
He's so generous too.

423
00:23:19,428 --> 00:23:20,929
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

424
00:23:21,722 --> 00:23:24,141
But I have dinner plans.

425
00:23:24,224 --> 00:23:25,892
Again?

426
00:23:25,976 --> 00:23:28,270
You're always trying to take off at night.

427
00:23:28,353 --> 00:23:30,313
Why do we need to have it at night?

428
00:23:37,612 --> 00:23:39,030
<i>Don't be scared!</i>

429
00:23:39,114 --> 00:23:42,576
<i>You're not in your twenties.
You can say whatever you want.</i>

430
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:44,870
<i>I'm quite old now. So what?</i>

431
00:23:44,953 --> 00:23:47,789
I'm sure there are people
who don't want to go, right?

432
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:51,668
To be honest,
it's not like you're paying us overtime.

433
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:53,920
We can't pick what we want to eat either.

434
00:23:54,004 --> 00:23:57,883
You'd get indigestion while trying
to please and humor your bosses.

435
00:23:57,966 --> 00:24:00,343
Also, we'd be lucky if it ends early,

436
00:24:00,427 --> 00:24:03,930
but if our superiors get in the mood,
we'll be dragged around all night

437
00:24:04,014 --> 00:24:05,849
hearing the same story again and again.

438
00:24:05,932 --> 00:24:07,976
After our ears start to bleed,

439
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:10,020
we'd barely escape
and make it home by midnight.

440
00:24:11,229 --> 00:24:13,023
And we wouldn't be able to enjoy

441
00:24:13,106 --> 00:24:15,692
the weekend properly
due to being hungover.

442
00:24:15,776 --> 00:24:17,611
So who are these dinners really for?

443
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,280
I'm sure they're not for me.

444
00:24:20,363 --> 00:24:22,783
I don't think they would be for me.

445
00:24:27,412 --> 00:24:30,957
Well, when did I ever force
company dinners on anyone?

446
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:33,376
You can come if you want to.

447
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,795
You're free to do what you want.

448
00:24:34,878 --> 00:24:36,755
- Absolutely.
- Of course, sir.

449
00:24:36,838 --> 00:24:39,800
If there's anyone who doesn't want
to attend, let me know.

450
00:24:39,883 --> 00:24:42,552
It's okay. You can tell me.

451
00:24:42,636 --> 00:24:43,637
There aren't any.

452
00:24:44,221 --> 00:24:45,597
As for the food,

453
00:24:46,264 --> 00:24:48,683
I mean, do we only eat pork belly?

454
00:24:48,767 --> 00:24:49,851
We have skin-on pork belly.

455
00:24:49,935 --> 00:24:52,103
We eat beef belly too. What's the issue?

456
00:24:52,187 --> 00:24:55,232
What is it?
Tell me if there's something you want.

457
00:24:55,315 --> 00:24:56,900
It's okay. You can tell me.

458
00:24:56,983 --> 00:24:59,319
Okay, then I'll tell you.

459
00:24:59,402 --> 00:25:02,239
It's not because I want
to eat something in particular.

460
00:25:02,322 --> 00:25:04,241
The odor gets on our clothes.

461
00:25:04,324 --> 00:25:08,954
Rather than a barbecue place
where young coworkers have to grill meat,

462
00:25:09,037 --> 00:25:12,082
wouldn't something like
a French restaurant be better?

463
00:25:14,751 --> 00:25:15,877
Sure! French it is!

464
00:25:16,503 --> 00:25:18,088
I like French cuisine too!

465
00:25:18,171 --> 00:25:19,171
Let's go!

466
00:25:19,214 --> 00:25:20,715
Let's go eat some French food!

467
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:21,842
It sounds great.

468
00:25:21,925 --> 00:25:23,301
Let's go with French.

469
00:25:23,385 --> 00:25:24,928
What else?

470
00:25:25,011 --> 00:25:26,221
Having it at night?

471
00:25:26,304 --> 00:25:27,889
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

472
00:25:27,973 --> 00:25:30,976
Then, let's have it
at 4:00 p.m. tomorrow. Okay?

473
00:25:31,601 --> 00:25:33,728
Okay, then I'll attend too.

474
00:25:33,812 --> 00:25:36,022
- Okay, then it's settled.
- Yes, sir.

475
00:25:36,106 --> 00:25:37,566
Okay, then.

476
00:25:42,988 --> 00:25:43,905
In return,

477
00:25:43,989 --> 00:25:47,200
come to work by 7:00 a.m. tomorrow.

478
00:25:47,284 --> 00:25:48,577
- What?
- 7:00 a.m.?

479
00:25:54,791 --> 00:25:56,877
- Come on!
- Seriously?

480
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,795
You get up early though.

481
00:25:58,879 --> 00:26:01,006
I like to sleep in!

482
00:26:01,089 --> 00:26:01,965
Jeez.

483
00:26:02,048 --> 00:26:03,174
How about some stretching?

484
00:26:13,435 --> 00:26:15,437
- Hey.
<i>- Hey, Won.</i>

485
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,314
<i>I looked into what you asked for.</i>

486
00:26:17,397 --> 00:26:18,315
What did you find?

487
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:21,192
So the person who saved you, Lim Sun?

488
00:26:22,235 --> 00:26:23,236
She's quite unusual.

489
00:26:23,862 --> 00:26:25,982
- What do you mean?
<i>- There aren't any records of her.</i>

490
00:26:26,948 --> 00:26:28,783
- What?
<i>- She doesn't have any records.</i>

491
00:26:29,451 --> 00:26:32,245
How can someone go through life
without ever getting a ticket?

492
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:33,246
Is she a real person?

493
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,372
<i>Besides that,</i>

494
00:26:34,456 --> 00:26:36,374
<i>you'd think she at least
had a phone, right?</i>

495
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:39,753
<i>But there's no record
of her activating one.</i>

496
00:26:42,213 --> 00:26:43,924
- There was nothing?
<i>- Nothing.</i>

497
00:26:44,007 --> 00:26:46,927
<i>Well, about 23 or 24 years ago,</i>

498
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:49,220
<i>there was
a canceled missing person report.</i>

499
00:26:49,304 --> 00:26:50,722
<i>There's no trace after that.</i>

500
00:26:50,805 --> 00:26:52,432
Okay, I see.

501
00:26:55,477 --> 00:26:58,396
A person who disappeared
more than 20 years ago…

502
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:02,484
Why is she here?

503
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:01,209
PC INTERNET CAFE

504
00:28:06,715 --> 00:28:09,926
Wow, holy cow. Aim is on point today.

505
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,261
What's with this guy?

506
00:28:13,847 --> 00:28:15,932
Wait a second. Today's…

507
00:28:16,766 --> 00:28:17,767
We might dominate today.

508
00:28:17,851 --> 00:28:19,644
Let's just get ten wins today.

509

I'll sell them all.

510

What? You came through the back?

511
00:28:26,276 --> 00:28:27,527
Welcome.

512
00:28:28,194 --> 00:28:29,446
Do you have an account?

513
00:28:29,529 --> 00:28:30,822
I'll just surf the web.

514
00:28:31,364 --> 00:28:32,574
You can sit wherever you like.

515
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:38,079
<i>I'm sure she came in here.</i>

516
00:28:45,503 --> 00:28:47,297
Okay! You're all dead!

517
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,298
Okay!

518
00:28:48,381 --> 00:28:49,382
All dead!

519
00:28:50,342 --> 00:28:52,010
Okay! We can do this!

520
00:28:52,093 --> 00:28:53,428
You can do it, Lee Mi-jin.

521
00:28:55,722 --> 00:28:58,892
This is nuts. Come on.

522
00:28:59,642 --> 00:29:00,810
I'll get you.

523
00:29:01,436 --> 00:29:03,938
Okay!

524
00:29:04,022 --> 00:29:07,108
Why do you play like this? What?

525
00:29:09,861 --> 00:29:12,197
- Excuse me?
- What the hell?

00:29:12,781 --> 00:29:14,366
Come on.

527
00:29:15,116 --> 00:29:16,785
What kind of play was that?

528
00:29:19,537 --> 00:29:21,164
Okay, good.

529
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:24,167
Nice.

<i>- I'll take it all.</i>

536
00:29:52,612 --> 00:29:54,739
- There you go.
<i>- Help me get to Diamond in Ranked.</i>

537
00:29:55,281 --> 00:29:56,116
Okay!

538
00:29:56,199 --> 00:29:58,201
That's 300,000 won,
so 1.8 million total! Nice!

539
00:29:59,744 --> 00:30:01,871
I'm so good. Seriously.

540
00:30:01,955 --> 00:30:03,915
I deserve to eat this <i>ramyeon</i> today.

541
00:30:03,998 --> 00:30:05,333
This is insane.

542
00:30:07,168 --> 00:30:08,169
Nice.

543
00:30:10,338 --> 00:30:12,257
It's so hot but so good.

544
00:30:17,595 --> 00:30:19,514
You've never seen anyone
eat <i>ramyeon</i> before?

545
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,065
My goodness.

546
00:30:29,858 --> 00:30:30,942
Why is this here?

547
00:30:32,444 --> 00:30:34,779
I'm so sorry! I thought this was mine.

548
00:30:34,863 --> 00:30:36,656
It had two eggs.

549
00:30:36,739 --> 00:30:40,285
No one else has ever ordered it
like this here before.

550
00:30:40,368 --> 00:30:41,995
If you don't mind,

551
00:30:42,954 --> 00:30:44,789
I'll order you a new one.

552
00:30:49,419 --> 00:30:51,754
It's okay. I can do it.

553
00:30:54,257 --> 00:30:55,341
<i>That scar…</i>

554
00:30:55,425 --> 00:30:57,760
<i>I got it as a kid
while playing with a cat.</i>

555
00:30:57,844 --> 00:30:59,471
<i>Doesn't this look like a heart?</i>

556
00:31:00,054 --> 00:31:01,264
It's like my tattoo.

557
00:31:05,143 --> 00:31:06,143
Do you eat kimchi?

558
00:31:07,312 --> 00:31:08,312
Kimchi.

559
00:31:14,527 --> 00:31:17,655
<i>So the person who saved you, Lim Sun?</i>

560
00:31:17,739 --> 00:31:19,157
<i>There aren't any records of her.</i>

561
00:31:19,908 --> 00:31:21,451
<i>She doesn't have any records.</i>

562
00:32:03,535 --> 00:32:04,536
What?

563
00:32:05,995 --> 00:32:07,080
Where did he go?

564
00:32:07,163 --> 00:32:08,248
Damn it.

565
00:32:08,331 --> 00:32:10,667
I added three eggs. How could he leave?

566
00:32:14,045 --> 00:32:15,046
What?

567
00:32:16,548 --> 00:32:17,632
My keychain.

568
00:32:20,176 --> 00:32:22,345
Where did I drop this?

569
00:33:38,296 --> 00:33:40,548
<i>Call me right away
if something dangerous happens.</i>

570
00:33:40,632 --> 00:33:42,592
<i>It doesn't matter when or where.</i>

571
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,441
<i>Hello?</i>

572
00:34:00,985 --> 00:34:02,111
<i>Hello?</i>

573
00:34:03,905 --> 00:34:04,906
Mi-jin?

574
00:34:05,782 --> 00:34:06,908
Hello?

575
00:34:08,701 --> 00:34:10,828
I'm sorry. I called you by accident.

576
00:34:11,704 --> 00:34:12,872
Is something wrong?

577
00:34:12,955 --> 00:34:14,040
No, nothing's wrong.

578
00:34:14,123 --> 00:34:16,417
No, really. It's fine. I'm sorry.

579
00:34:22,173 --> 00:34:23,424
I'll head over right now.

580
00:34:23,508 --> 00:34:25,385
<i>You don't even know where I am.</i>

581
00:34:25,468 --> 00:34:27,845
You're off work,
so you're probably near your house.

582
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:29,639
No, it's really okay.

583
00:34:29,722 --> 00:34:30,722
I just…

584
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:34,852
I thought a suspicious car
was following me.

585
00:34:34,936 --> 00:34:39,148
<i>After you told me about that killer,
I guess it had me spooked.</i>

586
00:34:40,191 --> 00:34:41,567
Are you really okay?

587
00:34:41,651 --> 00:34:43,695
Of course. I really am fine.

588
00:34:43,778 --> 00:34:46,114
Gosh, it's already so far away.

589
00:34:46,197 --> 00:34:47,198
I can't even see it.

590
00:34:47,907 --> 00:34:48,908
I'm hanging up now.

591
00:34:48,991 --> 00:34:49,991
Wait…

592
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:42,879
All right! It's on the house tonight
at Crazy Tasty Butcher Shop!

593
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,800
CELEBRATING DAUGHTER'S
FIRST PAY AS CIVIL SERVANT

594
00:35:48,384 --> 00:35:50,678
Hey, bakery shop! Come on over!

595
00:35:51,262 --> 00:35:55,308
- Crazy Tasty Butcher Shop is buying!
- Hurry on over!

596
00:35:55,391 --> 00:35:57,185
Hey, pig's trotters shop!
Come and eat!

597
00:35:57,268 --> 00:35:58,853
Where are the bakery folks?

598
00:36:00,062 --> 00:36:01,230
Mi-jin!

599
00:36:01,773 --> 00:36:03,107
You're finally here!

600
00:36:03,733 --> 00:36:05,943
This party's for you, you brat!

601
00:36:06,027 --> 00:36:08,029
What took you so long?

602
00:36:08,112 --> 00:36:09,530
Come over here.

603
00:36:09,614 --> 00:36:11,365
Everyone, Mi-jin's here!

604
00:36:18,372 --> 00:36:19,582
- Sure thing!
- Hey!

605
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:24,086
I'm here too.
I've grilled 25 kilograms of pork.

606
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,171
The meat's here!

607
00:36:25,254 --> 00:36:26,464
Goodness!

608
00:36:26,547 --> 00:36:27,799
My goodness.

609
00:36:28,966 --> 00:36:29,884
Hey, Mi-jin.

610
00:36:29,967 --> 00:36:31,427
What's with all this meat?

611
00:36:31,511 --> 00:36:33,471
Today's a special day.

612
00:36:33,554 --> 00:36:34,972
After eight long years,

613
00:36:35,056 --> 00:36:38,309
my daughter received her first paycheck!

614
00:36:41,437 --> 00:36:43,356
Take a look. I even did my hair.

615
00:36:43,439 --> 00:36:45,650
- Goodness.
- I went to the salon.

616
00:36:45,733 --> 00:36:47,276
Mom, that's enough. Please.

617
00:36:47,777 --> 00:36:48,777
Why?

618
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,906
It won't cost me that much
to brag a little like this.

619
00:36:51,989 --> 00:36:55,451
Everyone here had been thinking
and worrying about you so much.

620
00:36:55,535 --> 00:36:56,744
I'm so grateful to them.

621
00:36:57,578 --> 00:36:59,330
Mi-jin, every time you took the exam,

622
00:36:59,413 --> 00:37:02,333
I pulled out countless rice cakes for you.

623
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:03,793
You passed because of that.

624
00:37:05,419 --> 00:37:07,004
That's not why.

625
00:37:07,088 --> 00:37:09,799
It's because we brewed
pots of Korean medicine for her.

626
00:37:09,882 --> 00:37:12,218
I'd say that played a crucial role.

627
00:37:12,301 --> 00:37:14,595
- You're right!
- Good for you!

628
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:15,805
Okay.

629
00:37:15,888 --> 00:37:17,473
Say, "Thank you."

630
00:37:18,391 --> 00:37:19,517
Thank you.

631
00:37:22,854 --> 00:37:24,355
So when is this going to end?

632
00:37:24,438 --> 00:37:25,439
When?

633
00:37:25,523 --> 00:37:28,025
- At 100 kilograms.
- What? 100 kilograms?

634
00:37:28,109 --> 00:37:29,110
A hundred kilograms!

635
00:37:32,113 --> 00:37:34,407
Enough. You drank so much you're drunk.

636
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:36,075
Bring me some more soju.

637
00:37:36,158 --> 00:37:37,201
Stop drinking.

638
00:37:37,743 --> 00:37:39,579
Stop drinking. Let's go.

639
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:43,666
- That's enough. Go home now. My goodness.
- Mi-jin!

640
00:37:43,749 --> 00:37:44,876
- Thanks!
- Okay, bye!

641
00:37:44,959 --> 00:37:46,961
- Thanks!
- Goodness, he's drunk.

642
00:37:47,044 --> 00:37:48,212
Goodness.

643
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:51,299
Go in and rest. You've worked all day.

644
00:37:51,883 --> 00:37:53,676
Your dad and I can clean this.

645
00:37:53,759 --> 00:37:55,469
- Go in and rest.
- It's fine.

646
00:37:55,553 --> 00:37:58,431
You both worked all day too.
We can clean it faster together.

647
00:38:01,851 --> 00:38:03,102
Lim Sun.

648
00:38:03,185 --> 00:38:04,312
Don't you remember me?

649
00:38:04,395 --> 00:38:06,522
I'm Seo Sun-deok from Seohan Bank.

650
00:38:06,606 --> 00:38:08,774
We worked together at the Myeongil Branch.

651
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,613
- Mom.
- Yes?

652
00:38:13,696 --> 00:38:16,073
When Aunt Sun disappeared…

653
00:38:19,118 --> 00:38:20,161
I mean,

654
00:38:21,913 --> 00:38:23,164
when she left home…

655
00:38:24,832 --> 00:38:26,834
Wasn't she working at a bank?

656
00:38:28,336 --> 00:38:29,336
What about it?

657
00:38:30,129 --> 00:38:33,633
Didn't she suddenly quit back then?
She'd worked there for years.

658
00:38:34,342 --> 00:38:37,261
Yeah, it was her first job.
She was there for a long time.

659
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,723
But why? Why are you asking about that?

660
00:38:42,266 --> 00:38:43,517
No reason.

661
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:46,562
I just thought about her a lot today.

662
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,447
Goodness, they sure did stuff their faces.

663
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,251
That's right.

664
00:39:10,294 --> 00:39:11,671
Today's the company dinner.

665
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:24,129
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

666
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:38,059
MY FATHER DISAPPEARED! PLEASE FIND HIM!

667
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:41,521
HE WORKED AT SEOHAN DISTRICT
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE WHEN HE DISAPPEARED

668
00:39:43,773 --> 00:39:45,191
There you all are.

669
00:39:45,275 --> 00:39:46,651
Did you ride your bike here today?

670
00:39:46,734 --> 00:39:48,778
I left it at home
since we have dinner today.

671
00:39:48,862 --> 00:39:51,865
That's right.
Drunk driving applies to bicycles too.

672
00:39:51,948 --> 00:39:52,866
Good job.

673
00:39:52,949 --> 00:39:54,117
Good grief.

674
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,704
Why do we have to come to work
at the crack of dawn just for a dinner?

675
00:39:57,787 --> 00:40:00,331
I'm sorry for the inconvenience I caused.

676
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:02,834
Please have some tea.

677
00:40:02,917 --> 00:40:04,878
You didn't do anything wrong.

678
00:40:04,961 --> 00:40:06,212
Actually,

679
00:40:06,296 --> 00:40:08,423
I'm a morning person, so I'm grateful.

680
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:10,508
Think of your age.

681
00:40:10,592 --> 00:40:12,886
You still sleep in? Jeez.

682
00:40:12,969 --> 00:40:15,972
Don't you know beautiful women
need their beauty sleep?

683
00:40:16,055 --> 00:40:17,056
Yeah, sure.

684
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,266
Goodness.

685
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,226
Aren't you ashamed to say that yourself?

686
00:40:21,269 --> 00:40:23,938
You excrete melatonin hormones
when you sleep.

687
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:26,566
It's closely associated with our skin,

688
00:40:26,649 --> 00:40:29,068
so she's not wrong.

689
00:40:29,152 --> 00:40:30,152
See.

690
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:33,156
As expected,
educated people are so different.

691
00:40:38,286 --> 00:40:39,286
Goodness.

692
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:41,831
Thank you.

693
00:40:42,665 --> 00:40:45,001
Are you left-handed?

694
00:40:46,586 --> 00:40:47,587
Yes.

695
00:40:52,217 --> 00:40:54,052
Yes! Just a moment!

696
00:40:54,135 --> 00:40:55,135
Coming!

697
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,763
Who is it?

698
00:40:58,765 --> 00:40:59,599
Yes, hello.

699
00:40:59,682 --> 00:41:02,060
- Certified mail for Lee Mi-jin.
- Okay.

700
00:41:02,143 --> 00:41:03,728
Thank you.

701
00:41:07,106 --> 00:41:08,483
"Seohan Provincial Police Agency"?

702
00:41:13,154 --> 00:41:15,198
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

703
00:41:15,823 --> 00:41:19,244
It's about the Lee clan gathering.
It's just a notification.

704
00:41:19,327 --> 00:41:22,580
Goodness, whenever you
get together with them,

705
00:41:22,664 --> 00:41:24,707
you all try to rip each other apart.

706
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:26,417
Lee clan, my foot.

707
00:41:27,043 --> 00:41:28,086
I'm going out.

708
00:41:55,363 --> 00:41:57,573
<i>Mi-jin, are you going to be late tonight?</i>

709
00:41:57,657 --> 00:41:59,575
<i>- Yeah, I have a dinner.
- Come home early.</i>

710
00:41:59,659 --> 00:42:01,786
<i>Be careful. Don't drink too much.</i>

711
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:09,669
We're off work early today,
so let's all wrap things up.

712
00:42:10,586 --> 00:42:14,507
I put together the list of vehicles
ending in 6438. Should I print them out?

713
00:42:15,425 --> 00:42:16,425
Just a moment.

714
00:42:19,512 --> 00:42:20,555
Yes, Detective Kwon.

715
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:22,932
<i>I looked into your request</i>

716
00:42:23,016 --> 00:42:26,102
<i>about the detective who handled
the old missing persons cases.</i>

717
00:42:26,185 --> 00:42:27,395
Right. Did you find him?

718
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:30,064
<i>I don't think meeting with him
will help though.</i>

719
00:42:31,899 --> 00:42:32,984
Let me see him first.

720
00:42:33,067 --> 00:42:34,152
Text me the address.

721
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:38,865
Email it to me.
Something urgent came up. I have to go.

722
00:42:39,949 --> 00:42:41,993
What about the company dinner tonight?

723
00:42:42,618 --> 00:42:43,619
Company dinner…

724
00:42:50,543 --> 00:42:51,753
Mr. Cha!

725
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:52,754
It's so good!

726
00:42:52,837 --> 00:42:54,422
Can we order one more pizza?

727
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:55,381
Order all you want!

728
00:42:55,465 --> 00:42:57,342
- Yeah!
- Thank you!

729
00:42:58,092 --> 00:42:59,092
Mr. Cha!

730
00:42:59,594 --> 00:43:03,222
The chef heard where we're from
and prepared this for us on the house.

731
00:43:04,474 --> 00:43:05,683
This isn't bad.

732
00:43:05,767 --> 00:43:08,144
The food's good and so is the ambience.

733
00:43:09,729 --> 00:43:11,105
But where's Gye?

734
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:14,192
Well…

735
00:43:17,987 --> 00:43:18,863
Mr. Gye.

736
00:43:18,946 --> 00:43:20,323
Something urgent came up.

737
00:43:20,948 --> 00:43:23,159
Mr. Cha said attendance wasn't mandatory.

738
00:43:23,242 --> 00:43:24,452
Still…

739
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:27,205
Of course, it's not mandatory.
Did I say it was?

740
00:43:31,834 --> 00:43:33,961
Okay. One, two, three.

741
00:43:38,883 --> 00:43:40,385
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

742
00:43:42,512 --> 00:43:43,638
Mr. Ko Won!

743
00:43:44,263 --> 00:43:45,263
Come here.

744
00:43:51,396 --> 00:43:52,814
You're on non-active military duty.

745
00:43:52,897 --> 00:43:54,482
Work's over. Why are you here?

746
00:43:56,275 --> 00:43:57,568
I came for the company dinner.

747
00:44:00,363 --> 00:44:03,950
He wanted to come,
and I couldn't stop him.

748
00:44:04,033 --> 00:44:05,033
Jeez.

749
00:44:05,076 --> 00:44:08,454
Those who should come don't attend.
Those who don't need to do attend.

750
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:13,917
What was that?

751
00:44:15,294 --> 00:44:16,295
Well…

752
00:44:16,796 --> 00:44:17,797
This is a bit tough.

753
00:44:18,548 --> 00:44:19,548
Have some.

754
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:27,140
Have some of this too.

755
00:44:28,641 --> 00:44:29,642
Is that her?

756
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,812
The lady working for Mr. Gye.

757
00:44:33,563 --> 00:44:34,689
She's lasting a long time.

758
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:37,066
Still, hiring an old lady's a bit much.

759
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:38,609
Is the prosecutors' office a joke?

760
00:44:39,235 --> 00:44:40,235
Right.

761
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:41,821
She's a good worker.

762
00:44:43,948 --> 00:44:45,950
She's laid-back and handles tasks well.

763
00:44:46,033 --> 00:44:49,662
Unlike young people these days.
She's motivated and doesn't try to shirk.

764
00:44:49,745 --> 00:44:51,414
There's nothing to criticize.

765
00:44:53,833 --> 00:44:56,544
She would have to be like that
to work with Ji-ung.

766
00:44:57,837 --> 00:45:00,381
Mr. Gye doesn't hold back when he works.

767
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:02,008
He's so reckless.

768
00:45:02,091 --> 00:45:04,218
That's why we get along so well.

769
00:45:04,302 --> 00:45:06,721
I act wild when I get pissed too.

770
00:45:18,733 --> 00:45:19,733
Goodness.

771
00:45:20,693 --> 00:45:26,449
Your wife must be so happy
to have such a sweet husband like you.

772
00:45:28,034 --> 00:45:29,035
I suppose.

773
00:45:29,785 --> 00:45:31,579
If only she had lived longer,

774
00:45:32,455 --> 00:45:34,624
I would've taken care of her for life.

775
00:45:35,458 --> 00:45:37,210
Goodness. Then, you're a widower.

776
00:45:38,211 --> 00:45:39,503
So you're living alone

777
00:45:40,087 --> 00:45:42,506
after losing your wife.

778
00:45:43,299 --> 00:45:44,759
What about your children?

779
00:45:45,384 --> 00:45:48,221
After going abroad to study,
they settled down there.

780
00:45:48,304 --> 00:45:50,056
I haven't seen them in years.

781
00:45:50,139 --> 00:45:51,724
My goodness.

782
00:45:52,642 --> 00:45:56,646
You've been doing
an amazing job on your own.

783
00:45:56,729 --> 00:45:57,980
Let me pour you a glass.

784
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,650
I have to drive.

785
00:46:00,733 --> 00:46:01,609
It's fine.

786
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:04,070
- Just one drink.
- That's okay.

787
00:46:04,987 --> 00:46:06,155
If that's the case,

788
00:46:06,948 --> 00:46:09,825
I'll drink it for you.

789
00:46:09,909 --> 00:46:11,577
In return, you have to grant me a wish.

790
00:46:14,413 --> 00:46:15,413
Bottoms up.

791
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:18,834
That sounded more
like a threat than a request.

792
00:46:18,918 --> 00:46:19,794
Good grief.

793
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:22,088
I'm starting to feel nauseous.

794
00:46:22,755 --> 00:46:24,966
Do you have any kimchi here?

795
00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:25,883
Eat up.

796
00:46:25,967 --> 00:46:28,552
You should have a proper meal.

797
00:46:30,638 --> 00:46:31,638
<i>Shiny, shiny</i>

798
00:46:33,975 --> 00:46:35,601
<i>Shiny, shiny</i>

799
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:38,646
<i>Shiny, shiny</i>

800
00:46:41,524 --> 00:46:46,362
<i>She's so beautiful</i>

801
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:50,658
Wow! You're a great singer, Mr. Cha!

802
00:46:50,741 --> 00:46:52,285
Gosh, you're embarrassing me!

803
00:46:52,368 --> 00:46:54,870
My throat is a bit sore today.

804
00:46:54,954 --> 00:46:56,330
Hey!

805
00:46:56,414 --> 00:46:58,958
What's with the vibe here?

806
00:46:59,041 --> 00:47:00,668
It's because you're not drinking.

807
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:02,253
Come on. Raise your glasses!

808
00:47:02,336 --> 00:47:03,838
Everyone, down the hatch!

809
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:05,131
Bottoms up!

810
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:08,550
Come on!

811
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:09,593
Come out and sing!

812
00:47:10,428 --> 00:47:12,305
Okay, sing a song.

813
00:47:12,388 --> 00:47:15,308
Won, could you sing a song for us?

814
00:47:15,391 --> 00:47:17,393
Sing one of the songs you wrote.

815
00:47:17,476 --> 00:47:18,686
Sing a song.

816
00:47:19,437 --> 00:47:23,065
That wouldn't be fair.
I'll just be part of the audience today.

817
00:47:23,149 --> 00:47:25,818
Ms. Lim, don't just sit there either.

818
00:47:25,901 --> 00:47:27,028
Sing us a song.

819
00:47:27,111 --> 00:47:30,364
She's not singing because she can't.
Don't provoke her.

820
00:47:30,448 --> 00:47:33,242
Turning a blind eye
is more helpful at times like these.

821
00:47:33,326 --> 00:47:34,869
Come on. No way!

822
00:47:35,453 --> 00:47:37,621
You listen to music all day.

823
00:47:37,705 --> 00:47:40,291
You always have those round pebbles
stuck in your ears!

824
00:47:40,374 --> 00:47:42,668
My throat's not feeling great today.

825
00:47:42,752 --> 00:47:44,170
I don't feel well.

826
00:47:44,253 --> 00:47:46,172
Come on, now!

827
00:47:46,255 --> 00:47:47,923
Okay, starting now,

828
00:47:48,007 --> 00:47:50,217
I'll give a coupon to anyone
who gets a perfect score!

829
00:47:50,301 --> 00:47:52,386
A coupon?

830
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:54,263
- It's not for coffee, is it?
- No!

831
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:56,849
A coupon of your choice!

832
00:47:57,725 --> 00:47:58,851
Anything we want?

833
00:47:58,934 --> 00:47:59,810
Even for work tasks?

834
00:47:59,894 --> 00:48:00,894
What about a bonus?

835
00:48:00,936 --> 00:48:02,146
<i>A bonus?</i>

836
00:48:02,229 --> 00:48:05,649
Whatever your wish is,
I'll grant it for you!

837
00:48:05,733 --> 00:48:06,734
I promise!

838
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:08,652
Have it notarized!

839
00:48:09,945 --> 00:48:12,406
This song would be a hit!

840
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:13,491
Hold on!

841
00:48:14,033 --> 00:48:16,994
"MR Chu"? What's that?

842
00:48:28,255 --> 00:48:31,884
<i>When I see you once,
I want to see you two more times</i>

843
00:48:31,967 --> 00:48:35,638
<i>If I see you two, three times,
I want to hug you even more</i>

844
00:48:35,721 --> 00:48:39,600
<i>I want to wear couple rings with you</i>

845
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:43,729
<i>And walk down this road together</i>

846
00:48:44,313 --> 00:48:47,691
<i>Even though I see you every day,
I like you even more</i>

847
00:48:48,275 --> 00:48:51,195
<i>Even when I pinch myself
two, three times</i>

848
00:48:51,779 --> 00:48:53,948
<i>It's like I'm dreaming, dreaming</i>

849
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:55,908
<i>It's like I'm in a dream</i>

850
00:48:55,991 --> 00:49:00,162
<i>I smile at just the thought of you</i>

851
00:49:01,747 --> 00:49:04,333
<i>Mr. Chu
On my lips, chu</i>

852
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:06,669
<i>Sweetly, chu</i>

853
00:49:06,752 --> 00:49:10,673
<i>I lose all strength in my body</i>

854
00:49:10,756 --> 00:49:13,509
<i>You shake up my heart
You shake me up</i>

855
00:49:14,176 --> 00:49:17,596
<i>I'm falling, falling for your love</i>

856
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,641
<i>Hey, you On my lips, chu</i>

857
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:22,977
<i>Every day with you</i>

858
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,938
<i>When I see you, my eyes close</i>

859
00:49:26,021 --> 00:49:29,817
<i>Will you secretly come to me
And kiss me again?</i>

860
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:34,822
<i>You're like my dream
You're my Mr. Chu</i>

861
00:49:39,535 --> 00:49:40,828
Jeez.

862
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:43,038
What's with me?

863
00:49:43,122 --> 00:49:44,623
I didn't even drink that much.

864
00:49:46,292 --> 00:49:47,877
Do drinking limits age too?

865
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:12,193
What the hell?

866
00:50:37,009 --> 00:50:39,011
Wait a second. Let's see.

867
00:50:39,094 --> 00:50:40,221
It goes this way.

868
00:50:41,847 --> 00:50:43,182
How did they do it?

869
00:50:53,734 --> 00:50:55,027
It's tangled now.

870
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:59,990
NEULPALAN NURSING HOME

871
00:51:05,704 --> 00:51:08,082
Find the starting point
and solve it from there.

872
00:51:15,339 --> 00:51:16,257
Please find her!

873
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,508
Find my mom!

874
00:51:17,591 --> 00:51:20,302
I know you hated her,
but you still always visited her!

875
00:51:20,386 --> 00:51:21,971
Jeez, this is getting old.

876
00:51:22,054 --> 00:51:24,807
You've done this for days now!
So what, then?

877
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:27,768
Are you saying
it's my fault she disappeared?

878
00:51:28,394 --> 00:51:31,146
Find her! Bring back my mom!

879
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:32,106
You little punk.

880
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:34,692
Don't you move. Stay right there!

881
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:36,359
Go.

882
00:51:36,944 --> 00:51:38,112
Find her!

883
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:40,573
Find my mom!

884
00:51:40,656 --> 00:51:42,449
You're a bad detective!

885
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:43,909
Find her!

886
00:51:45,911 --> 00:51:47,746
Find my mom!

887
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:49,456
Find her!

<i>You said all cops were bad.</i>

889
00:51:53,669 --> 00:51:56,422
When you were shouting, I said,

890
00:51:56,505 --> 00:51:59,675
"Kids like you always get arrested
when you grow up

891
00:51:59,758 --> 00:52:01,594
and ruin your lives."

892
00:52:04,013 --> 00:52:05,013
Yeah.

893
00:52:05,264 --> 00:52:08,350
Thanks to those wise words,
I'm doing well as a civil servant.

894
00:52:09,852 --> 00:52:12,313
Gosh, you're so persistent.

895
00:52:19,153 --> 00:52:20,571
I came just in case.

896
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:23,616
But I think I wasted my time.

897
00:52:33,167 --> 00:52:34,877
If it's been tangled for too long,

898
00:52:37,296 --> 00:52:39,298
it's better to just cut it off.

899
00:52:54,521 --> 00:52:55,521
Goodness.

900
00:52:56,523 --> 00:52:58,067
Hey, Gyeong-hui.

901
00:52:59,026 --> 00:53:00,402
You're being too harsh.

902
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:04,448
Don't be like that.
Just help me this one time.

903
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:06,659
How many times have I told you?

904
00:53:06,742 --> 00:53:07,951
I didn't see anything.

905
00:53:08,035 --> 00:53:09,703
I couldn't see anything.

906
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:11,997
I know. You didn't see anything.

907
00:53:12,081 --> 00:53:13,499
But what about a glimpse?

908
00:53:13,582 --> 00:53:15,793
- Even a little glimpse is enough.
- Damn it.

909
00:53:16,377 --> 00:53:17,836
Get out! Just go!

910
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,296
Are you crazy?

911
00:53:21,215 --> 00:53:23,842
It's all broken! Seriously?

912
00:53:23,926 --> 00:53:28,055
Look, I know I'm forcing someone
to do something they don't want to.

913
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:30,516
I hate this too.

914
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:32,518
But we don't have any evidence.

915
00:53:32,601 --> 00:53:34,645
We can't identify the culprit.

916
00:53:34,728 --> 00:53:37,690
Even if we wanted to,
there's no way to catch them.

917
00:53:38,565 --> 00:53:39,566
In any case,

918
00:53:40,109 --> 00:53:41,902
I didn't see anything
that day even if I did.

919
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:42,820
Understand?

920
00:53:42,903 --> 00:53:46,198
Then, are you saying
that even though someone's missing,

921
00:53:46,281 --> 00:53:48,450
you'll sit back and do nothing?

922
00:53:48,534 --> 00:53:50,035
Damn it! Did I hide her?

923
00:53:50,828 --> 00:53:51,995
I don't care where they went!

924
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:54,331
- I don't know anything!
- Wait.

925
00:53:54,415 --> 00:53:55,582
- Get lost!
- Wait!

926
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:57,251
- Get lost!
- It's not that!

927
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:58,669
Hold on!

928
00:53:59,128 --> 00:54:00,170
Come on!

929
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:02,297
Wait! Just listen!

930
00:54:02,381 --> 00:54:03,966
We need your help to capture them!

931
00:54:04,049 --> 00:54:06,260
I heard everything from Madame Kwak!

932
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:09,346
I know you saw something
in the alley behind Seohan Bank!

933
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:10,889
I know you saw something!

934
00:54:10,973 --> 00:54:11,849
Seriously?

935
00:54:11,932 --> 00:54:13,767
You're really going to be like this?

936
00:54:13,851 --> 00:54:14,685
Wait!

937
00:54:14,768 --> 00:54:16,228
Put yourself in our shoes!

938
00:54:42,463 --> 00:54:43,797
Mom.

939
00:54:43,881 --> 00:54:45,174
Don't cry.

940
00:54:46,717 --> 00:54:47,968
I'm scared.

941
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:51,096
I'm so scared.

942
00:54:51,847 --> 00:54:53,474
I pretended like I didn't know.

943
00:54:54,641 --> 00:54:57,686
Don't cry, Mom.

944
00:55:09,656 --> 00:55:13,952
<i>Mr. Gye, here's the list of silver SUVs
ending in 6438 that you asked for.</i>

945
00:55:14,036 --> 00:55:15,746
<i>I'm sending it to you by email now.</i>

946
00:55:19,875 --> 00:55:21,794
OFFICE ASSISTANT LIM SUN

947
00:55:21,877 --> 00:55:23,504
INVESTIGATOR JU BYEONG-DEOK

948
00:55:26,215 --> 00:55:27,049
Hello?

949
00:55:27,132 --> 00:55:28,884
When are you going to come?

950
00:55:28,967 --> 00:55:31,887
Ms. Lim just tore up the stage
with her cuteness.

951
00:55:32,721 --> 00:55:33,764
Ms. Lim?

952
00:55:33,847 --> 00:55:37,351
Yes. The karaoke you hate so much

953
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,645
wrapped up just now.

954
00:55:40,521 --> 00:55:41,438
For round three…

955
00:55:41,522 --> 00:55:43,106
It'll be soju and spicy fish roe soup.

956
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:45,442
He'll repeat the same story.
An infinite loop.

957
00:55:45,526 --> 00:55:49,112
Mr. Cha said attendance
wasn't mandatory, but you know him.

958
00:55:49,196 --> 00:55:50,614
He holds grudges.

959
00:55:50,697 --> 00:55:52,074
It'll affect me too.

960
00:55:52,825 --> 00:55:54,993
<i>- By chance, did you know?</i>
- What?

961
00:55:55,077 --> 00:55:57,287
Baek Cheol-gyu was
Hwadong Medical Center's director.

962
00:55:58,413 --> 00:55:59,623
He was?

963
00:56:00,332 --> 00:56:01,583
<i>Yeah, isn't that crazy?</i>

964
00:56:01,667 --> 00:56:03,627
<i>He's a well-known local pillar.</i>

965
00:56:09,675 --> 00:56:11,927
PLATE NUMBER 6438

966
00:56:32,573 --> 00:56:34,533
This is for your ears only, but…

967
00:56:35,242 --> 00:56:36,910
Wait a second. What?

968
00:56:36,994 --> 00:56:37,994
What is it?

969
00:56:38,537 --> 00:56:39,663
Never mind.

970
00:56:39,746 --> 00:56:41,999
- Have fun.
<i>- Mr. Gye, wait!</i>

971
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,390
That scared me.

972
00:57:06,982 --> 00:57:08,442
<i>She's so beautiful</i>

973
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:10,861
<i>She's so beautiful</i>

974
00:57:10,944 --> 00:57:11,862
Nice!

975
00:57:11,945 --> 00:57:14,281
I told you it's true!

976
00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:16,491
But that bottle of beer!

977
00:57:17,451 --> 00:57:18,452
Ms. Lim!

978
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:20,871
You were incredible!

979
00:57:20,954 --> 00:57:22,456
I mean! Wow!

980
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,042
You're still a spring chicken!

981
00:57:26,418 --> 00:57:28,045
Hey, the time!

982
00:57:28,128 --> 00:57:30,047
Look at the time! It's still early!

983
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:31,632
Okay!

984
00:57:31,715 --> 00:57:32,966
Let's go for a third round!

985
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:35,969
Third round will be soju
and spicy fish roe soup!

986
00:57:36,053 --> 00:57:37,387
Okay, let's go!

987
00:57:37,971 --> 00:57:38,805
Let's go.

988
00:57:38,889 --> 00:57:40,849
Hurry, let's go!

989
00:57:41,725 --> 00:57:43,602
Who should I call him as?

990
00:57:44,978 --> 00:57:46,563
He didn't call me.

991
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:49,942
He called Lim Sun's phone.

992
00:57:50,025 --> 00:57:51,109
LIM SUN, LEE MI-JIN

993
00:57:51,193 --> 00:57:52,236
It wasn't Mi-jin.

994
00:57:52,778 --> 00:57:54,655
I'll call with Lim Sun's number then.

995
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:57,115
PROSECUTOR GYE JI-UNG

996
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:03,080
DOCUMENTS

997
00:58:05,624 --> 00:58:06,458
Hello?

998
00:58:06,541 --> 00:58:08,627
<i>I didn't get a perfect score.</i>

999
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:09,753
<i>Wait…</i>

1000
00:58:09,836 --> 00:58:10,836
Go ahead.

1001
00:58:15,634 --> 00:58:16,468
<i>I just…</i>

1002
00:58:16,551 --> 00:58:18,887
<i>I thought a suspicious car
was following me.</i>

1003
00:58:18,971 --> 00:58:22,641
After you told me about that killer,
I guess it had me spooked.

1004
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:26,353
DOCUMENTS

1005
00:58:55,048 --> 00:58:56,174
You have to go home.

1006
00:58:56,591 --> 00:58:57,591
Hey!

1007
00:58:59,094 --> 00:59:01,221
The dinner's just starting to get fun.

1008
00:59:01,305 --> 00:59:04,808
Why are you trying to ruin it? Let go.

1009
00:59:05,392 --> 00:59:06,685
I said let go!

1010
00:59:10,188 --> 00:59:12,524
- You punk!
- All right!

1011
00:59:12,607 --> 00:59:15,193
We'll be going home now.

1012
00:59:15,277 --> 00:59:16,153
- Wait!
- All right!

1013
00:59:16,236 --> 00:59:17,070
Now, now!

1014
00:59:17,154 --> 00:59:18,196
I told you!

1015
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,115
Anyone is free to go!

1016
00:59:20,198 --> 00:59:22,659
All right! This is not mandatory!

1017
00:59:22,743 --> 00:59:23,744
Let's go!

1018
00:59:23,827 --> 00:59:25,579
- Thank you! Have fun!
- Thank you!

1019
00:59:26,413 --> 00:59:29,875
Not mandatory!

1020
00:59:30,709 --> 00:59:32,210
Let's go to round three!

1021
00:59:32,294 --> 00:59:33,337
Quickly!

1022
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:34,338
Okay, let's go.

1023
00:59:34,421 --> 00:59:36,673
- Ok-hui!
- Let's just go. It's okay.

1024
00:59:36,757 --> 00:59:37,841
Ok-hui!

1025
00:59:42,596 --> 00:59:43,680
Where is everyone?

1026
00:59:49,561 --> 00:59:51,730
What do you think you're doing?

1027
00:59:51,813 --> 00:59:52,981
Go home now.

1028
00:59:54,066 --> 00:59:55,734
I didn't drink that much. What's with me?

1029
00:59:55,817 --> 00:59:57,652
It's almost time so just go.

1030
00:59:57,736 --> 00:59:59,780
I'll figure it out. Don't worry about it.

1031
00:59:59,863 --> 01:00:01,198
Let's part ways here.

1032
01:00:03,158 --> 01:00:04,409
You're out of time!

1033
01:00:05,786 --> 01:00:06,786
You little punk.

1034
01:00:07,245 --> 01:00:09,915
How dare you speak
to an elder like that?

1035
01:00:09,998 --> 01:00:11,375
The sun will set soon.

1036
01:00:14,586 --> 01:00:15,837
Do I need to spell it out?

1037
01:00:16,588 --> 01:00:17,672
What's going on?

1038
01:00:18,757 --> 01:00:21,093
Let's go somewhere quiet and talk.

1039
01:00:21,176 --> 01:00:22,552

<i>Not yet…</i>

1046
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:33,748
Don't move or you might get caught.

MISS NIGHT AND DAY

1048
01:02:36,061 --> 01:02:37,521
<i>How did you find out?</i>

1049
01:02:38,355 --> 01:02:42,025
Why do I think this situation
seems to have something to do with you?

1050
01:02:42,108 --> 01:02:43,108

- What are you doing? Seriously.
- Excuse me.

1059
