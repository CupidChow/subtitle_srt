10
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:12,489
Hey, kid.

11
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,992
- You'll get the highest score on the exam.
- Me?

12
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,161
But when it comes to getting a job…

13
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,537
Come here for a second.

14
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:23,750
It can't be done
with just grit or perseverance.

15
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,211
Isn't it time you realized that by now?

16
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,337
Who are you?

17
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,466
You could say I'm like a miracle worker
that makes the impossible possible.

18
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,427
I don't believe in luck or miracles.

19
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,430
The world might deceive you,

20
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:41,059
but a miraculous business card
could change your life.

21
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,770
"We never know the worth of...

22
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,857
the water till the well is dry."

23
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,910
I pray to the heavens.

24
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:03,665
Please let our Mi-jin pass
her civil service exam.

25
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:07,335
She's been studying her tail off
for eight straight years,

26
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,754
and she's failed each time!

27
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:13,341
There's no misfortune
as disastrous as this.

28
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,343
If she fails again this time,

29
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:18,054
she's going to keep studying for it

30
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,056
all the way until she's forty

31
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,433
since she's so stubborn!

32
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:25,687
Please help our family
this one time. I beg of you.

33
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,231
My goodness! Oh, no!

34
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,650
That wretched stray cat!

35
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,986
My gosh! Oh, no! What am I going to do?

36
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:33,903
Goodness.

37
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,489
I swear…

38
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,369
- Next, Jeong Min-su.
- Yes.

39
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,370
And Lee Mi-jin.

40
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,288
- Yes!
- Yes!

41
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,747
- Lee Mi-jin?
- Yes?

42
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:45,748
- Yes?
- Come in.

43
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,585
Lee Mi-jin?

44
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,502
Yes.

45
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:50,837
Please go ahead.

46
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,214
I see you're both named Lee Mi-jin.

47
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,632
Lee Mi-jin One, in her twenties.

48
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,385
Lee Mi-jin Two, in her thirties.
Let's do it this way.

49
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,095
I'm also in my twenties though.

50
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,098
If you're 28, you're in your thirties.

51
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,641
Most apply in their twenties.

52
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,727
Those in their thirties
or forties will be tough.

53
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,772
I'm armed with maturity
and unlimited energy!

54
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:12,275
I ranked the highest
on personality and physical tests.

55
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,528
I'm the best in terms
of my strong will and effort as well!

56
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,529
Just a moment.

57
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,156
- Lee Mi-jin One.
- Just sit.

58
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,700
My MBTI is ENFP.

59
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,328
My strength is that I'm bright
like a puppy.

60
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,747
I know I can do well!

61
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,582
- I can do it!
- I can do it!

62
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,182
WE REGRET TO INFORM YOU
THAT YOU WERE NOT SELECTED

63
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,645
What am I going to tell my mom this time?

64
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,376
I'm home.

65
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,836
Mi-jin!

66
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,128
- Yeah?
- Come here.

67
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,465
Why didn't you tell me?

68
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:18,383
Are you upset?

69
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,634
Of course, I am!

70
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,719
All right, dear. That's enough.

71
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,263
This calls for a celebration.

72
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,517
I called the environmental department.

73
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,353
You should've told us
that you got the job!

74
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,980
Why didn't you say anything?

75
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:35,191
- I got the job? Me?
- Yeah!

76
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,819
<i>I see you're both named Lee Mi-jin.</i>

77
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,362
Lee Mi-jin One, in her twenties.

78
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,990
Lee Mi-jin Two, in her thirties.
Let's proceed this way.

79
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,286
Mom, it's not what you think…

80
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,912
I know I'm saying this in hindsight,

81
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,622
but during that whole time

82
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:53,543
while you were locked in your room
studying for civil service exams,

83
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,170
it felt like rocks in my mind
weighing me down,

84
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,757
and I couldn't comfortably eat anything
for even a day. Did you know?

85
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,926
What's the point of telling her that now?

86
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,054
Because she got the job!
Imagine if she'd failed again!

87
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,224
Do you really think I could say
what I just said to her?

88
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,559
Anyway…

89
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,440
Goodness, it's such a relief. I mean it.

90
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,816
Isn't it?

91
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,277
I was embarrassed
to show my face around town.

92
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,571
Anyway, great job. Okay?

93
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,281
My baby.

94
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,199
At least you finally got a job.

95
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,911
I can die in peace now.

96
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,832
I'm so happy!

97
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,594
Hi, dear!

98
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,095
It's me.

99
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,806
You're the one who told me

100
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,559
to call you first
when my daughter got a job.

101
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,730
Yeah! She got the job.

102
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,107
What? Seven years.

103
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,360
After failing interviews for seven years,

104
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,028
she made it in her eighth year!

105
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,113
Don't say all of that!

106
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,823
What? Right.

107
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:49,867
Are you okay?

108
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,579
Thank you.

109
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,331
I think you hit your forehead…

110
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,922
I thought about it a lot
before coming here.

111
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:07,010
Things like this should be settled easily
so everything can be done at once.

112
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,928
This really isn't a scam, right?

113
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,596
What do you take me for?

114
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,309
Look into my eyes.

115
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,980
Do I look like a fraud
who'll bleed someone dry?

116
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,067
Jeez, why are you dressed
like a court lady? I feel uncomfortable.

117
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:27,864
I had a gig as an extra.
There was a lady who was a no-show.

118
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,115
I didn't have time to change.

119
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,994
But if it were that easy
to get a government job,

120
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,747
the eight years I spent studying
would feel like a waste.

121
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:40,126
I don't give this chance to just anyone.

122
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,462
Just one spot opened up
and I barely got it

123
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,380
after begging for it.

124
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:49,218
To be honest, I had no idea there was
a recommendation system in place.

125
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,553
Give me the documents first.

126
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,891
I brought all of the documents
you asked me to prepare.

127
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,399
These days, everyone's hired
through nepotism.

128
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,777
That's why our poor
and innocent job seekers

129
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,613
keep failing their interviews
after all their hard work.

130
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:14,327
But… your fees seem rather high.

131
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,497
Couldn't you give me a small discount?

132
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:21,125
A big discount is great,
but a small one's okay too.

133
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,170
Are you trying to haggle
like we're at a marketplace?

134
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,129
Come on.

135
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:28,466
Just spend your life job seeking
until you're old and tired then.

136
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,093
No.

137
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,928
I'll pay it.

138
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,430
It's expensive. Don't touch.

139
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,519
Be ready. I hit the jackpot today.

140
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,522
I'll buy you something good.
Tell me what you want to eat.

141
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,442
Goodness, I am so sorry.

142
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,946
Excuse me, but may I use
your phone to make a call?

143
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,948
I have to meet someone,
but I lost my phone.

144
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,616
I'd really appreciate it.

145
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:54,867
Make it quick then.

146
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,285
Okay, thank you.

147
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,584
Hey, it's me.

148
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,545
Yeah, it's not my number.

149
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,297
Some idiot stole my phone.

150
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,842
No, it's fine.

151
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,886
Track this phone's location and details.

152
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,391
Here you go. Thank you.

153
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,770
Goodness.
Some idiot must've stolen your phone.

154
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,022
I know. The world's full of crooks.

155
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,608
The world's a terrible place these days.

156
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,860
You have to be careful.

157
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,239
Did you make the deposit?

158
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,408
My limit's only five million won.

159
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,535
Can I send you the rest tomorrow?

160
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:40,121
I can't do business with you
if you keep this up.

161
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,248
I might not be able to continue.

162
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,125
I'll go and get it
from the bank right now.

163
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:47,003
<i>That's a burner phone.
I tracked its location just in case.</i>

164
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:48,880
Go quickly.

165
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,759
Thank you for earlier. Here you go.

166
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,596
You didn't have to.

167
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,513
Thank you.

168
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,682
That's hot!

169
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:00,766
Wait, it's not hot.

170
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,226
Damn it.

171
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,978
- Sorry.
- My wallet can't get wet.

172
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,271
- Give it here.
- Damn it!

173
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,814
- Use these napkins.
- Jeez.

174
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,482
Yeah, can you run a background check?

175
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,359
The name's "Choi Geun-ju."

176
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,570
Resident registration number is 891017.

177
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,405
- And 112…
- Are you insane?

178
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,491
Damn it!

179
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,914
What's going on?

180
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,749
Can't you tell? He's a scammer.

181
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,423
Hey! You bastard!

182
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,804
Hey, you jerk!

183
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,147
Who the hell are you?

184
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,591
Damn, he was on me like a leech!
He was so tall though.

185
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,100
Hey, you scammer!

186
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,352
There you are, you fraud! Hey!

187
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,728
Give back my money! Hey!

188
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,189
- I'm sorry!
- Hey, wait…

189
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:31,899
Hey!

190
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,360
Stop right there!

191
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:35,736
Stop, you jerk!

192
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,826
Are you okay?

193
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,911
It's dangerous, so don't follow.

194
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,998
What in the world?

195
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,459
Mr. Gye?

196
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,927
Let go of me!

197
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:03,556
You could find a decent job if you want,
but you leech off others instead?

198
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,849
Who are you? Are you a cop?

199
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:06,892
I'm the cop, punk!

200
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,978
Who is this punk?

201
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,397
He scams job seekers.

202
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,815
I caught him at the scene,

203
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,150
you can take him in now.

204
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,319
Wow, you caught him within ten minutes?

205
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,696
Get up, punk.

206
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,409
Hey! You bastard!

207
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,662
Hey!

208
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,164
- Give me my money!
- What is this?

209
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,415
- Give it!
- What are you doing?

210
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,876
Give me back my money!

211
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,711
That's enough. You can't do this.

212
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,296
- My money!
- You can't do this!

213
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,716
You rotten punk.

214
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,968
You had nothing better to do
than steal pennies?

215
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,219
Don't hit me!

216
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,353
I can't go home like this.

217
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,608
That money was from my mom's shop.

218
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:59,278
Mom…

219
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,532
I'll escort her to the station.

220
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,452
She could get emotional again
while riding with the perpetrator.

221
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:09,163
He's the type who'd say
both parties were at fault.

222
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,248
Okay. We have to question the victim.

223
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,793
- Please do it as quickly as you can.
- Okay.

224
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,825
Excuse me, ma'am?

225
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,285
I was looking for you.

226
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,413
Thank you for earlier.

227
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,332
Put these on first.

228
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,961
No, it's fine. I'm okay.

229
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,838
The witness interview takes a long time.

230
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,424
The station's floor is cold. Put them on.

231
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,842
Thank you.

232
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,301
Also, we'll take my car.

233
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,137
No, I can take the bus.

234
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,055
Your bag and things are in my car.

235
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,223
Put those shoes on first.

236
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,385
- Put your seatbelt on.
- Okay.

237
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,100
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

238
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,728
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's okay.

239
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,983
<i>Why is this man so friendly?</i>

240
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,736
<i>Is he trying to scam me too?</i>

241
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,738
Thank you for the ride.

242
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,241
I don't normally meddle
in other people's business, but…

243
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,035
<i>But?</i>

244
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,329
I guess I felt a sense of responsibility.

245
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,456
<i>What responsibility?</i>

246
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,708
I'm just saying
there's no need to thank me.

247
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,585
Okay.

248
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,380
But how did you meet that fraud?

249
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,674
Well…

250
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,469
It's kind of embarrassing to say.

251
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,979
I'm sorry,
but this is all I have right now.

252
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,025
- It's fine.
- Thank you for everything.

253
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,151
It's fine--

254
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,279
It's really okay…

255
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,744
She seems so normal.
How did she fall victim to that fraud?

256
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,886
Wow, you're pretty brave.

257
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,138
You came up with a scam
at civil service exams?

258
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,807
If you want to dig a well,

259
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,684
you have to go somewhere
with thirsty people

260
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:20,020
to increase your chances of success,
and that's just how it works.

261
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,689
- You punk.
- Sir, that's illegal.

262
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,649
You should shove his face into that bowl.

263
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,276
This is a police station, you punk.

264
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,069
- Goodness.
- Detective?

265
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:30,239
But when do you think
I can get my money back?

266
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,117
Well, it was deposited
into a voice phishing account.

267
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,660
You can't get it right away.

268
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:35,744
What?

269
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,122
No.

270
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,916
I need that money now.

271
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,167
Wait…

272
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,296
Did you bring emergency funds
to give to the scammer?

273
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,380
Well…

274
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,217
- That bastard…
- Wait!

275
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,011
- Give me my money!
- What are you doing?

276
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,846
- Now, now.
- Why are you eating?

277
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,348
Calm down, okay?

278
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,726
But he…

279
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,230
He said if I paid the fee,

280
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,399
I'd get the job.

281
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,526
- Okay.
- I could get a loan for civil servants.

282
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,903
And he said I could
get my money back right away.

283
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,697
So?

284
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,161
I gave him my bankbook too.

285
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,245
What?

286
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,206
I gave him my bankbook.

287
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,916
- You gave him your bankbook?
- Goodness!

288
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,793
- Good grief, ma'am!
- My gosh!

289
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,295
I'm not that old!

290
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,507
Sir, I'll look into his fake accounts too.

291
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,425
All right.

292
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,553
Did I do something wrong again?

293
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:37,389
If this ends up being connected
to a phishing case,

294
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:41,393
the victim can become
the perpetrator in a heartbeat!

295
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,228
But I'm the victim.

296
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,480
I know that!

297
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:56,909
Goodness.

298
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,099
What is this?

299
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,308
SELF-INTRODUCTION

300
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:22,267
RÉSUMÉ

301
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,521
Put your seatbelt on.

302
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:38,826
NAME: LEE MI-JIN
RESIDENT REGISTRATION NUMBER: 960316

303
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,119
She was born in 1996?

304
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,762
<i>There are so many companies in the world.</i>

305
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,978
<i>But how come there's no place
to work for me?</i>

306
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,322
Hello?

307
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,241
<i>- Is this Lee Mi-jin?</i>
- Yes.

308
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,326
<i>This is
Seoul District Prosecutors' Office.</i>

309
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:25,205
<i>Your personal information has been leaked.
Check the balance of your bank account--</i>

310
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:29,042
Excuse me. I'm in no position
to take a call like this right now.

311
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,128
<i>Then, if you send
your public key certificate--</i>

312
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,212
Listen,

313
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,799
I only have 1,500 won
in my account, so it's fine.

314
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,093
<i>Don't be like that.
Before the funds are withdrawn--</i>

315
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,804
You don't seem to get it
since I'm saying it nicely.

316
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:45,350
I'm in no mood for this kind of call,
you damn fraud!

317
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,894
You think I'm stupid?

318
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,980
- Do I look stupid to you?
<i>- Do you know who I am?</i>

319
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,482
Who are you?

320
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,484
<i>I'm Jang Chen!</i>

321
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,736
<i>You can't even earn a living, you wretch!</i>

322
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,613
- Speak for yourself!
<i>- What did you say?</i>

323
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,865
<i>- Hey--</i>
- Is he out of his mind?

324
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,171
Is it you again? The prosecutor?

325
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,466
- How did you know?
- I warned you.

326
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,426
I said I'm in no mood for it today.

327
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,554
I understand you're upset
because of the scammer.

328
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,473
- But why the rude words…
<i>- You understand?</i>

329
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,976
If you understand,
then how did you get my number?

330
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,938
It seems your personal information

331
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,856
accidentally fell into my hands.

332
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,316
"Accidentally"?

333
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,110
Hey, you crazy psycho!
You're worse than a rabid dog!

334
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,695
I can't believe what you're saying.

335
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:42,616
Who do you think you are
to call me back like this?

336
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:45,285
Are you insane? You said you were
Jang Chen earlier, right?

337
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,746
If you're Jang Chen,
I'm my neighborhood's Jang Yi-soo!

338
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,665
<i>If you call me one more time,</i>

339
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,793
I'm going to rip your lips off
and hang them off the moon!

340
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,963
So you better brace yourself
if you're going to call me again!

341
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,047
<i>You bastard!</i>

342
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,929

<i>The next stop is Saeyeoul Apartments.</i>

344
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,269
- I'm sorry.
<i>- The next stop is Saeyeoul Elementary.</i>

345
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,271
My stomach suddenly hurts.

346
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,609
<i>The person you are trying to call

347
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:21,989
Wow.

NAME: LEE MI-JIN

349
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,342
What do I do?

350
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,397
I'm a mess.

351

SOUNDS OF CALMING RAIN AT DAWN

352
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,571
<i>Daeho-ri in Seohan City…</i>

353
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,741
It's a very strange place.

354
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,619
Twenty years ago,

355
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,412
a lot of women went missing.

356
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:58,210
There was a witness connected
to the disappearances, but they died.

357
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,255
<i>Things settled down after that.</i>

358
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,677
But it's hard to investigate
when an adult goes missing.

359
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,390
<i>Where do you think</i>

360
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,768
<i>all of those missing people went?</i>

361
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,332
It's a cat.

362
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,043
Hi.

363
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,838
Why aren't you running away?

364
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,717
It's really not running away.

365
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,013
Are you hungry?

366
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,435
Wait.

367
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,441
I got this from my gig today.

368
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,569
I think you can drink this.

369
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,362
Here, drink it.

370
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,034
You don't have anywhere to go either?

371
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,956
Same here.

372
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,501
What's even sadder is

373
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,338
no one's looking for me.

374
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,469
Why aren't you drinking?

375
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,313
You look just like this cat I know.

376
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,690
Instead of a broke job seeker like me,

377
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:45,901
make sure you find a rich owner

378
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:49,279
who gets paid well
and feeds you nice organic food.

379
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,280
Got it?

380
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,699
Here, drink this.

381
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:54,409
Good.

382
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,374
I can't pet you
since I have milk in my hand.

383
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,045
<i>Fine dust is in full swing</i>

384
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:08,256
<i>in the central region, including Seoul.</i>

385
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,384
<i>The government has issued
a fine dust warning across the nation.</i>

386
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,136
I'm home.

387
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,180
Hey. Welcome home, Mi-jin!

388
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,182
<i>It will decrease.</i>

389
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,017
<i>But instead of better air quality…</i>

390
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,644
Why are you dressed like that?

391
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,146
Why are you wearing that?

392
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,523
I told you I had a gig.

393
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:30,111
A maiden ghost yesterday
and a middle-aged court lady today.

394
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,280
It's not like you get paid
that much though.

395
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,242
Is that why you were too busy
to answer your phone today?

396
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,368
Did you call?

397
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,120
My phone's out of battery.

398
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,956
I almost forgot. Mi-jin.

399
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,583
Did you make the payment
for the goods the other day?

400
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,377
Did you pay the wrong person?

401
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,463
I made the payment.

402
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,673
Right?

403
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:53,218
Jeez. But why did say they didn't get it?

404
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,595
- Why the fuss?
<i>- This happened in the city today.</i>

405
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,973
<i>An absurd incident
occurred today in Seohan City,</i>

406
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:01,142
<i>where a job fraud victim
had their personal information leaked</i>

407
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,936
<i>and was framed for voice phishing.</i>

408
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,104
<i>Here's a video we received.</i>

409
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:06,982
My goodness.

410
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,234
Dad, where's the remote? Where is it?

411
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,443
- You scared me.
- The remote.

412
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,445
What is it?

413
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,489
But I was watching the news.

414
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,991
- What's wrong with you?
- Well…

415
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,201
It's just that…

416
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,036
Your Majesty.

417
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,791
Your Majesty,
I ask for your understanding.

418
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:25,876
What are you doing?

419
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,878
Go and take a shower!

420
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:31,214
I bought some hanger steak

421
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,883
just for you tonight.

422
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,218
- Okay?
- You're a butcher's daughter.

423
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,804
But you always complained
you never had any Hanwoo to eat.

424
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:42,225
You begged
for premium grade <i>Hanwoo </i>every day.

425
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:46,229
You're the one who said
you couldn't even waste pork on me either.

426
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,856
That was a long time ago.

427
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:52,193
A jobless bum can't compare
to a respectable office worker.

428
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:56,281
Forget it. I don't need it.
Someone like me should starve.

429
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:57,824
What? Are you on a diet?

430
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:03,121
I just want to go to bed early tonight.

431
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,499
What's wrong with you?

432
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,751
Leave her be.

433
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:10,837
She finally got a job
after seven years of studying.

434
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,255
She must be exhausted.

435
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,299
She looks so lethargic.

436
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,385
Should I make some ox knee soup for her?

437
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,289
I'll eat dinner later.

438
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,131
What's this?

439
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,384
DEAR DAUGHTER, WEAR THESE
ON YOUR FIRST DAY TO WORK

440
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,313
Jeez.

441
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:13,733
Mom!

442
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,193
Who told you to buy me shoes?

443
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,529
Why do you keep doing things
out of character?

444
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,199
I bought you those.

445
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,743
I didn't ask you to buy me shoes, Dad.

446
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:27,247
You barely have any pocket money.
Who said I needed them?

447
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,711
What's the matter with that girl?

448
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,963
Come on out, you brat!

449
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:39,217
You're proud of barely being able
to get a job after seven years?

450
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,344
Stop being so arrogant!

451
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:45,974
LEE MI-JIN, TEST PREP
KOREAN

452
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,646
Why are you tossing those out?

453
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,482
You could get money for those
from a used bookstore!

454
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,735
That foolish girl!

455
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,442
<i>"Mi" means "small,"
and "jin" means "progress."</i>

456
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:41,821
<i>If you improve little by little,
you'll become someone big one day.</i>

457
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,491
<i>It's the meaning behind the humble name
my parents gave me.</i>

458
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,254
<i>I often wanted to quit when I couldn't see</i>

459
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,173
<i>the light at the end of the tunnel.</i>

460
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:03,718
<i>But I didn't stop or look back.</i>

461
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,720
<i>I kept going without rest.</i>

462
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,979
I WILL NEVER STOP

463
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:43,675
<i>What I can confidently say to the person
reading this right now is…</i>

464
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,803
Number 27, please come in.

465
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:47,720
Yes, sir.

466
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:52,684
<i>Even though I experienced failure
much more than success in my life,</i>

467
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:55,770
<i>I'll never get tired and stop.</i>

468
00:30:56,354 --> 00:31:00,400
<i>And I'll make progress little by little
today and tomorrow.</i>

469
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,916
I worked so hard in life.

470
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:21,045
There was never a day
when I didn't work hard.

471
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,682
I worked so hard
and didn't rest for a single day.

472
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,520
But…

473
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,650
what do I have to show for it?

474
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:48,114
Why am I the only one
who ended up like this?

475
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,206
You've got to be kidding me.

476
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,500
Sure, it might as well rain.

477
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:15,058
This is ridiculous!

478
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:21,481
If you're willing to grant this,
why didn't you just grant me a job?

479
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,997
RÉSUMÉ
NAME: LEE MI-JIN

480
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:46,756
There it is.

481
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,758
Mr. Kim!

482
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,428
Mr. Kim <i>Soju</i>!

483
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,305
It's our fourth time meeting.

484
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,059
Now, let's drink!

485
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,853
All right, let's drink!

486
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:13,366
What?

487
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:15,785
Hey. You.

488
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,289
Aren't you the cat I met earlier?

489
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:22,000
Do you like me?

490
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:26,546
Or do I look pathetic to you too?

491
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:32,135
Thanks for staying by my side.

492
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:36,639
Thanks. Hey. Damn.

493
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:41,561
What? You just said you liked me.

494
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,023
Jeez, you scared me! Hey!

495
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,443
Don't go in there! Hey!

496
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,365
<i>I wish…</i>

497
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,410
<i>I could just disappear like this…</i>

498
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,496
<i>without anyone knowing.</i>

499
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:02,624
<i>Or…</i>

500
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,669
<i>I wish I could be someone else.</i>

501
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,495
<i>What's wrong with my body?</i>

502
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,539
<i>Did I catch a cold from the rain?</i>

503
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,543
<i>It doesn't feel like the flu.</i>

504
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,799
<i>My body aches so much.</i>

505
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,771
<i>You must've had
a lot of stress while raising kids.</i>

506
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,856
<i>- Stress.</i>
<i>- Stress!</i>

507
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,899
<i>A lot of stress!</i>

508
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:12,235
I feel so nauseous.

509
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,653
When did I come in last night?

510
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,037
- Honey, another cucumber.
- Okay.

511
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,583
Dad.

512
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,627
I feel really weird.

513
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:33,339
Gosh. Your body is tensing up
now that you have to go to work.

514
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:34,882
Mi-jin.

515
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:38,469
- Can you scratch my back?
- Just take a shower.

516
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,430
- Jeez. Here?
- No, next to it.

517
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,307
- Here?
- A little lower.

518
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,267
Right there.

519
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:48,604
But I do feel really weird, Dad.

520
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,691
It feels heavy, and I'm aching all over.

521
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,235
- Is it the hangover?
- That's good.

522
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,196
- That's good.
- Did you have hairtail?

523
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,906
That feels so good.

524
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:00,950
It feels so nice.

525
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,160
What are you doing?

526
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,578
What do you think?

527
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,080
- What in the world?
- What's with you?

528
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,666
- What is this?
- What's going on between you two?

529
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,667
What are you saying?

530
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:11,127
I don't know this lady!

531
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,421
Who are you? Why are you in our house?

532
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,047
- Who are you?
- Jeez.

533
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,175
What's wrong with you two?

534
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,718
- Mi-jin!
- What?

535
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,305
- Mi-jin!
- What?

536
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:26,100
- Mi-jin!
- What's wrong with you?

537
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,101
Where's Mi-jin?

538
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,896
- You really don't know her?
- I told you I don't!

539
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,773
- Who is this lady?
- What's with you?

540
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,983
I said I'm feeling awful.

541
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,444
Mom, where's the medicine?

542
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,030
What is with you two?

543
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,782
- Call the cops!
- Okay!

544
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,701
Where did I have it wrapped up?

545
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:45,620
- Leave while I'm being nice.
- What?

546
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,789
- Get out.
- Seriously! Stop it!

547
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,290
- Lee Mi-jin!
- What?

548
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,083
Who are you, lady?

549
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:54,212
Why are you being like this?
I'm right here!

550
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:55,213
Mom.

551
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,548
<i>- This is the police.</i>
- Dad--

552
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,926
Hello! This is 44 Daeho-ri!

553
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:00,843
Yes, that's it.

554
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,513
A strange person has broken into our home!

555
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:06,057
Yes, it's some old lady.
She's a total stranger!

556
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,391
Why are you doing this?

557
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,060
Is it because of yesterday?

558
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,603
I'll tell you everything!

559
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,980
- Mom!
- Please come quickly!

560
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,065
- Dad!
- Don't!

561
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,775
What's with you two?

562
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,068
- Seriously!
- Just go!

563
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:18,694
- Just go!
- Mom!

564
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,238
Get out right now!

565
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,697
What's with you? Snap out of it!

566
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,115
- Get out!
- Please come now!

567
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,575
Why are you doing this?

568
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,118
Please leave, lady!

569
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,328
Get out, lady!

570
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,830
- Mi-jin!
- What?

571
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,456
- Get out!
- Dad!

572
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,419
They've gone insane!

573
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,089
What's with them?

574
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:45,137
Move out of the way!

575
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,055
Move!

576
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,850
Sir, are you okay?

577
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,309
- Do I look okay?
- I'm sorry!

578
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,019
Watch where you're going!

579
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:53,521
Damn it!

580
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,315
Hey, lady! Get it together, will you?

581
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:01,487
I know I don't have makeup on,
but I'm not old enough to be called that.

582
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,127
What's this?

583
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,296
What is this?

584
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,092
What's wrong with my face?

585
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,388
What's going on?

586
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,348
You better call your insurance!

587
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,850
- Come fix this!
- What is this belly?

588
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,476
Hey! You!

589
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,978
Where are you going?

590
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,855
It's the cops!

591
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,648
Officer, there's been an accident!

592
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,276
Over here! Someone call my insurance!

593
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:41,235
Ma'am, hold on!

594
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,987
Don't move, ma'am!

595
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,697
- Just wait.
- Mom, calm down.

596
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,490
- Stop calling me that!
- It's me, Mi-jin!

597
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,326
- I'm not your mom!
- Over here!

598
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,619
Over here!

599
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:50,786
- Officer!
- What is it?

600
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,704
I'm their daughter.

601
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:54,081
No, she's not! She's not our daughter!

602
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:57,376
She keeps calling me "Mom," but I'm not!

603
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,669
This is insane!

604
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:00,796
I'm your daughter!

605
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,174
I got this belly overnight!

606
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:06,135
Our daughter doesn't have a potbelly!

607
00:39:07,171 --> 00:39:09,397
Who are you?

608
00:39:11,184 --> 00:39:13,811
Excuse me, ma'am. What is your name?

609
00:39:16,689 --> 00:39:17,982
I'm Lee Mi-jin.

610
00:39:18,066 --> 00:39:20,902
- My gosh.
- And your resident registration number?

611
00:39:21,903 --> 00:39:22,904
It's 960316…

612
00:39:22,987 --> 00:39:23,863
- Nine…
- 2651--

613
00:39:23,947 --> 00:39:25,490
What? Born in 1996?

614
00:39:26,908 --> 00:39:30,370
Seriously, why are you doing this?

615
00:39:30,453 --> 00:39:32,539
She totally planned this.

616
00:39:32,622 --> 00:39:35,333
You look normal on the outside,
but you broke into our house.

617
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:36,918
And you're posing as my daughter!

618
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:38,628
- Mom!
- My gosh!

619
00:39:38,711 --> 00:39:41,297
- I'm not a stranger! I'm Mi-jin!
- Officer!

620
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:43,216
I said I'm Mi-jin!

621
00:39:44,175 --> 00:39:46,052
This is ridiculous!

622
00:39:46,135 --> 00:39:46,970
Take a seat.

623
00:39:47,053 --> 00:39:48,304
- Take a seat.
- Mom!

624
00:39:48,388 --> 00:39:50,640
Your birthday is June 13
and blood type is B.

625
00:39:50,723 --> 00:39:52,559
And you have a wart on your butt.

626
00:39:53,476 --> 00:39:55,520
Dad, you gave me your emergency funds!

627
00:39:56,062 --> 00:39:57,188
Jeez!

628
00:39:57,272 --> 00:39:59,357
This is crazy!

629
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:01,401
Did you tell her?

630
00:40:01,484 --> 00:40:04,028
What's wrong with you? It wasn't me!

631
00:40:04,112 --> 00:40:07,115
Then, how does she know
about the wart on my butt?

632
00:40:07,198 --> 00:40:08,032
Ma'am.

633
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:11,452
Seriously, who are you?
Do you have something against our family?

634
00:40:11,536 --> 00:40:13,871
I'm really Mi-jin!

635
00:40:14,872 --> 00:40:16,457
I really am Mi-jin!

636
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:17,959
Sit down! Just sit!

637
00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:20,461
Why would you go
into someone else's house?

638
00:40:20,545 --> 00:40:22,630
Sir, how old do I look to you?

639
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:25,675
Seriously, I was born in 1996.

640
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:28,595
My goodness!

641
00:40:28,678 --> 00:40:29,512
Unbelievable.

642
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:30,513
That's right!

643
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:31,556
My ID!

644
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:34,350
Here. Look at this. We're the same, right?

645
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:35,518
- Honey.
- If you look…

646
00:40:35,602 --> 00:40:36,978
- That's Mi-jin's wallet!
- Right?

647
00:40:37,061 --> 00:40:38,479
- Hey! Her wallet!
- Hey!

648
00:40:40,398 --> 00:40:43,735
She stole her clothes too!
She totally planned this!

649
00:40:43,818 --> 00:40:45,570
Come here right now.

650
00:40:46,112 --> 00:40:47,071
- Come here!
- Honey!

651
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:50,533
- Where's Mi-jin?
- Calm down.

652
00:40:50,617 --> 00:40:52,118
I feel like I'm insane.

653
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:55,371
When I woke up,

654
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:57,457
I looked old like this.

655
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,458
I see.

656
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:01,044
Is this a dream? It's not, right?

657
00:41:01,127 --> 00:41:01,961
Right?

658
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:06,424
Are there hidden cameras?

659
00:41:06,507 --> 00:41:07,800
She must be crazy!

660
00:41:10,803 --> 00:41:12,472
I really was born in 1996!

661
00:41:13,556 --> 00:41:15,183
I'm going to lose my mind!

662
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,810
I was born in 1996!

663
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:19,729
This is insane!

664
00:41:19,812 --> 00:41:20,897
How did this happen?

665
00:41:30,531 --> 00:41:32,617
I don't think she's in her right mind.

666
00:41:33,201 --> 00:41:36,329
She doesn't have a guardian,
and she doesn't know her own name.

667
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:39,540
Is it dementia?

668
00:41:44,212 --> 00:41:45,922
This makes no damn sense.

669
00:41:47,548 --> 00:41:48,883
This is my face?

670
00:41:51,594 --> 00:41:52,679
This is crazy.

671
00:41:53,513 --> 00:41:55,223
I think I'm crazy.

672
00:41:55,932 --> 00:41:56,766
What do I do?

673
00:41:56,849 --> 00:41:58,142
Excuse me?

674
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:01,562
- Did you really age overnight?
- Yes, sir.

675
00:42:02,522 --> 00:42:04,607
Instead of being here like this,

676
00:42:04,691 --> 00:42:06,984
shouldn't you go to a lab somewhere?

677
00:42:07,068 --> 00:42:09,779
Or tell your story to that show,
<i>Unanswered Questions?</i>

678
00:42:09,862 --> 00:42:11,197
Wait a second.

679
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,408
- I know one of the producers.
- No, it's fine.

680
00:42:13,491 --> 00:42:14,867
Just wait. It's okay.

681
00:42:14,951 --> 00:42:16,661
- No, later--
- It's okay.

682
00:42:16,744 --> 00:42:17,912
A lab?

683
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,415
By the way,

684
00:42:21,165 --> 00:42:22,417
I keep looking at her,

685
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,335
and she does look familiar.

686
00:42:25,086 --> 00:42:26,754
It's like I've seen her before.

687
00:42:26,838 --> 00:42:29,006
- Where?
- I think she's unwell.

688
00:42:29,799 --> 00:42:31,467
We'll take care of this.

689
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,136
- We'll reprimand her too.
- Okay.

690
00:42:35,054 --> 00:42:36,472
I feel bad for her.

691
00:42:38,057 --> 00:42:42,812
By the way, can't you scan
her fingerprints and find out who she is?

692
00:42:42,895 --> 00:42:45,022
Actually, we're going to scan them

693
00:42:45,106 --> 00:42:46,899
and find her place of residence…

694
00:42:47,734 --> 00:42:49,652
What? Where did she go?

695
00:42:49,736 --> 00:42:50,570
Where is she?

696
00:42:50,653 --> 00:42:52,697
- Hey! Where'd the lady go?
- Where is she?

697
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,740
My goodness!

698
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:56,451
She got away! What do we do?

699
00:42:57,869 --> 00:43:00,329
Lady, don't come near me again! Move!

700
00:43:00,413 --> 00:43:02,290
Move! Damn it!

701
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:06,419
- I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry.
- Damn it!

702
00:43:06,502 --> 00:43:08,463
- Seriously, are you insane?
- I'm sorry.

703
00:43:08,546 --> 00:43:10,965
- Ma'am, where are you going?
- Twice in one day!

704
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:13,509
Damn it!

705
00:43:13,593 --> 00:43:14,719
Where are you going?

706
00:43:14,844 --> 00:43:17,013
- Hey!
- Please stop!

707
00:43:40,536 --> 00:43:41,621
Excuse me!

708
00:43:41,704 --> 00:43:43,206
A lady came in here, right?

709
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:44,707
Damn it. I'm exhausted.

710
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:46,417
How was that lady so fast?

711
00:43:47,084 --> 00:43:48,252
Ma'am!

712
00:43:48,336 --> 00:43:49,796
Stop playing and come out.

713
00:43:53,591 --> 00:43:55,051
What are you doing?

714
00:43:55,718 --> 00:43:56,886
Goodness.

715
00:43:56,969 --> 00:43:59,305
You thought hiding your head
would make you invisible?

716
00:43:59,388 --> 00:44:01,182
What are you, an ostrich? Come out.

717
00:44:01,265 --> 00:44:02,725
Why are you doing this?

718
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:04,477
- Come on, lady!
- Let go!

719
00:44:06,854 --> 00:44:09,732
I said I'm not a strange person!

720
00:44:10,608 --> 00:44:12,026
My gosh! I'm sorry!

721
00:44:12,109 --> 00:44:14,153
I'm so sorry! Are you okay?

722
00:44:14,237 --> 00:44:15,905
I'm sure she came in here.

723
00:44:15,988 --> 00:44:17,698
What's suddenly up with him?

724
00:44:36,842 --> 00:44:37,843
I'm back.

725
00:44:39,345 --> 00:44:43,516
I'm back now.

726
00:44:44,475 --> 00:44:46,727
I'm back!

727
00:44:50,231 --> 00:44:51,232
Ma'am.

728
00:44:52,567 --> 00:44:53,859
I look younger, right?

729
00:44:56,904 --> 00:44:58,281
Do I look like an old lady?

730
00:44:59,156 --> 00:45:00,157
No.

731
00:45:01,492 --> 00:45:03,202
Do I look like I'm in my twenties?

732
00:45:07,832 --> 00:45:08,916
Mom! Dad!

733
00:45:09,542 --> 00:45:11,127
Where have you been?

734
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:13,170
It was total chaos today.

735
00:45:13,254 --> 00:45:16,507
Some weird lady
broke into our house this morning.

736
00:45:16,591 --> 00:45:17,800
It was no joke.

737
00:45:18,801 --> 00:45:19,635
Look.

738
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:22,513
That madwoman had even stolen your wallet.

739
00:45:22,597 --> 00:45:25,933
Your mom's preparing to increase
security here in a large way.

740
00:45:26,017 --> 00:45:27,727
What kind of security?

741
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:35,651
Where did you get these clubs?

742
00:45:35,735 --> 00:45:37,194
I borrowed them from next door.

743
00:45:37,278 --> 00:45:40,531
We didn't have any suitable weapons.
We need to be prepared in advance.

744
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,034
- Pick one.
- No, I'm fine.

745
00:45:43,117 --> 00:45:44,201
They look scary.

746
00:45:47,204 --> 00:45:48,998
Here. You take this.

747
00:45:49,081 --> 00:45:49,915
Here.

748
00:45:50,499 --> 00:45:51,334
Okay.

749
00:45:52,752 --> 00:45:54,086
After today,

750
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,922
something worse could happen.

751
00:45:57,006 --> 00:45:58,341
We need to be prepared.

752
00:46:02,261 --> 00:46:04,055
How dare she sneak into our home?

753
00:46:04,138 --> 00:46:06,515
- She called me her mom!
- She called me her dad!

754
00:46:07,183 --> 00:46:08,809
<i>That was me.</i>

755
00:46:09,602 --> 00:46:11,187
Mom!

756
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:14,065
She clearly looked much older than me.

757
00:46:14,148 --> 00:46:15,650
It was ridiculous.

758
00:46:15,733 --> 00:46:17,652
<i>I said that was me.</i>

759
00:46:17,735 --> 00:46:20,029
But where have you been all day?

760
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,448
Were you with Ga-yeong?

761
00:46:24,158 --> 00:46:24,992
Yeah.

762
00:46:26,786 --> 00:46:27,787
What's with her?

763
00:46:38,297 --> 00:46:40,591
<i>Wow. What's going on?</i>

764
00:46:41,425 --> 00:46:43,344
<i>Why did I suddenly get old?</i>

765
00:46:45,054 --> 00:46:47,098
<i>And how did I come back?</i>

766
00:46:47,181 --> 00:46:48,474
<i>Was it just for a moment?</i>

767
00:46:49,308 --> 00:46:50,768
<i>But why just my appearance?</i>

768
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:54,230
<i>Even if I was a little achy
because of a hangover,</i>

769
00:46:54,313 --> 00:46:57,441
<i>but I still had
the same stamina and energy.</i>

770
00:46:58,150 --> 00:46:59,527
<i>Damn it.</i>

771
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:01,404
Is it a disease that ages the face?

772
00:47:13,165 --> 00:47:14,750
SUDDENLY OLD…

773
00:47:15,459 --> 00:47:17,545
RAPIDLY AGING FACE

774
00:47:18,337 --> 00:47:19,672
What do I do?

775
00:47:19,755 --> 00:47:22,007
RAPIDLY AGING FACE AFTER LOSING BABY FAT

776
00:47:22,091 --> 00:47:23,300
Okay.

777
00:47:26,011 --> 00:47:30,141
<i>What did I do wrong?
Why did I suddenly get old?</i>

778
00:47:32,518 --> 00:47:33,519
<i>Wait.</i>

779
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:36,480
<i>I was old when I woke up.</i>

780
00:47:36,564 --> 00:47:38,649
Was it because of the sun?

781
00:47:51,787 --> 00:47:52,955
<i>I can't die yet.</i>

782
00:47:53,706 --> 00:47:55,541
<i>I still have so much to do.</i>

783
00:47:56,292 --> 00:47:57,543
<i>I have to go on dates,</i>

784
00:47:58,335 --> 00:48:00,755
<i>get a job so I can give
my parents pocket money,</i>

785
00:48:01,589 --> 00:48:04,175
<i>and take time off
to travel overseas with Ga-yeong.</i>

786
00:48:05,843 --> 00:48:07,762
<i>We said we'd go to famous restaurants.</i>

787
00:48:27,323 --> 00:48:28,324
It's morning!

788
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:33,120
What's happening to me?

789
00:48:33,871 --> 00:48:35,414
What is this?

790
00:48:42,129 --> 00:48:44,673
Mi-jin! Hey, what's going on?

791
00:48:45,716 --> 00:48:46,801
Don't come in!

792
00:48:46,884 --> 00:48:48,385
I said don't come!

793
00:48:48,469 --> 00:48:49,970
What's the matter, Mi-jin?

794
00:48:50,596 --> 00:48:52,473
- Should I come in?
- No.

795
00:48:52,556 --> 00:48:54,099
It's nothing.

796
00:48:54,183 --> 00:48:55,768
It's nothing. Don't come in.

797
00:48:57,186 --> 00:48:59,021
What's wrong with your voice?

798
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:03,984
I caught a cold.

799
00:49:04,485 --> 00:49:05,528
My voice is hoarse.

800
00:49:06,946 --> 00:49:07,863
Are you okay?

801
00:49:07,947 --> 00:49:09,281
Yeah, I'm okay.

802
00:49:21,126 --> 00:49:22,336
Am I wearing underwear?

803
00:49:35,766 --> 00:49:36,892
<i>The veterinary clinic!</i>

804
00:49:45,943 --> 00:49:47,736
Hello. Do you remember me?

805
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,740
May I see the cat I left here last night?

806
00:49:56,745 --> 00:49:58,247
Okay. Here you go.

807
00:49:58,914 --> 00:50:01,959
The cat fell in a well.

808
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:03,502
Can you take a look?

809
00:50:05,629 --> 00:50:09,466
<i>The cat was moved
after treatment but disappeared.</i>

810
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:11,135
<i>This has never happened before.</i>

811
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,220
<i>I'm very sorry.</i>

812
00:50:13,804 --> 00:50:14,972
<i>Disappeared?</i>

813
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,766
<i>Where did it go?</i>

814
00:50:20,019 --> 00:50:22,313
<i>Yeah, I need to find that cat first.</i>

815
00:50:33,908 --> 00:50:35,284
MISSING PERSON
NAME: LIM SUN

816
00:50:40,004 --> 00:50:41,881
We demand a not-guilty verdict!

817
00:50:41,964 --> 00:50:43,758
- Ko! Not guilty!
- Ko! Not guilty!

818
00:50:43,841 --> 00:50:45,301
- Ko!
- Not guilty!

819
00:50:45,384 --> 00:50:47,303
We demand a not-guilty verdict!

820
00:50:47,386 --> 00:50:48,512
Not guilty!

821
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:07,365
Despite substantial evidence
against the defendant,

822
00:51:07,448 --> 00:51:09,033
he has denied the crime itself

823
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:13,287
and has claimed temporary insanity
in an attempt to avoid punishment.

824
00:51:13,371 --> 00:51:14,205
DEFENDANT

825
00:51:14,288 --> 00:51:15,373
Your Honor,

826
00:51:15,456 --> 00:51:18,292
he is a prominent figure
with large influence on society.

827
00:51:19,126 --> 00:51:21,837
We request that he receives
a more severe punishment.

828
00:51:21,921 --> 00:51:23,089
That is all.

829
00:51:32,848 --> 00:51:34,183
COURT

830
00:51:41,399 --> 00:51:42,233
<i>Breaking news.</i>

831
00:51:42,817 --> 00:51:45,278
<i>King Land member, Ko Won,
had claimed innocence…</i>

832
00:51:45,861 --> 00:51:47,697
Hey, coming soon!

833
00:51:48,322 --> 00:51:49,657
Will he finally appear?

834
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:50,992
Who's all the fuss about?

835
00:51:51,075 --> 00:51:52,952
You don't know Prosecutor Gye Ji-ung?

836
00:51:53,619 --> 00:51:54,745
It's Gye Ji-ung!

837
00:52:00,251 --> 00:52:01,335
I'm sorry.

838
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:09,760
<i>He seems like a normal lawyer.</i>

839
00:52:09,844 --> 00:52:11,470
He may seem that way,

840
00:52:11,554 --> 00:52:13,472
but he changes when he's in work mode,

841
00:52:13,556 --> 00:52:14,640
like Jekyll and Hyde.

842
00:52:14,724 --> 00:52:17,518
To cover a story,
you should mind your manners first.

843
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:21,856
Your cheap and prying methods
are why you're called trash journalists.

844
00:52:21,939 --> 00:52:24,233
- Unbelievable.
- Seriously?

845
00:52:24,317 --> 00:52:28,237
The Prosecutors' Office was criticized
for being lenient by asking for a fine.

846
00:52:28,321 --> 00:52:30,239
Wouldn't you say that it's warranted?

847
00:52:30,323 --> 00:52:32,533
<i>Pretending to be close, smart, or tough…</i>

848
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:34,035
Well, you reap what you sow.

849
00:52:34,702 --> 00:52:36,370
So I came to take responsibility.

850
00:52:36,454 --> 00:52:38,789
- He hates that.
- Dirty prosecutors made a mess.

851
00:52:38,873 --> 00:52:41,250
A proper prosecutor like me
will clean it up.

852
00:52:41,334 --> 00:52:42,752
The problem is

853
00:52:43,336 --> 00:52:44,920
he knows he's good.

854
00:52:45,004 --> 00:52:46,714
I'll respond with my skills.

855
00:52:46,797 --> 00:52:48,758
My high conviction rate shows you that.

856
00:52:48,841 --> 00:52:50,217
He's so annoying.

857
00:52:50,301 --> 00:52:51,969
Were there any other questions?

858
00:52:52,803 --> 00:52:53,804
If not, please move.

859
00:52:53,888 --> 00:52:56,265
Then, why was he put
in charge of that big case?

860
00:52:56,349 --> 00:52:57,683
He has a bad personality,

861
00:52:58,267 --> 00:52:59,769
but he's the best.

862
00:53:03,272 --> 00:53:04,273
Attack!

863
00:53:22,083 --> 00:53:23,918
Who is this jerk?

864
00:53:24,001 --> 00:53:25,127
Hey!

865
00:53:31,967 --> 00:53:33,052
What?

866
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:41,936
It's a good thing Mr. Gye
doesn't work at our district office.

867
00:53:42,019 --> 00:53:42,853
Wow.

868
00:53:43,646 --> 00:53:45,773
Just think of this as Heaven on earth.

869
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:48,192
Welcome to paradise!

870
00:53:50,569 --> 00:53:51,404
Damn it.

871
00:54:00,538 --> 00:54:01,539
Damn!

872
00:54:03,082 --> 00:54:04,583
Was I really this skinny?

873
00:54:10,631 --> 00:54:11,674
Damn it.

874
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:41,871
Mom.

875
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:43,998
I'm just borrowing them.

876
00:54:45,458 --> 00:54:46,834
The scarf too.

877
00:54:47,918 --> 00:54:48,919
Thanks!

878
00:55:14,862 --> 00:55:16,280
Goodness.

879
00:55:16,363 --> 00:55:17,448
She's something else.

880
00:55:26,665 --> 00:55:27,875
Get up already!

881
00:55:29,335 --> 00:55:30,503
Get up!

882
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,090
You sleep during the day
and go out at night!

883
00:55:35,174 --> 00:55:36,717
No wonder you can't sleep!

884
00:55:40,095 --> 00:55:42,264
- Open up.
- I can't.

885
00:55:42,348 --> 00:55:44,141
- Open the door!
- No way.

886
00:55:45,476 --> 00:55:46,852
You really want to do this?

887
00:55:47,561 --> 00:55:48,395
Just you wait.

888
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:49,855
That brat.

889
00:55:58,656 --> 00:56:00,074
What do you take me for?

890
00:56:00,157 --> 00:56:01,742
You think I can't open this?

891
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:03,786
Just you wait, you brat.

892
00:56:10,167 --> 00:56:11,669
Your room is a mess!

893
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,672
You're still asleep in bed.

894
00:56:15,631 --> 00:56:18,342
That's why you're getting fat!

895
00:56:18,425 --> 00:56:20,177
- You brat!
- That hurts!

896
00:56:24,098 --> 00:56:25,516
Come on out!

897
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,101
Why are you so strong?

898
00:56:27,893 --> 00:56:30,563
Come out of there! What's with you?

899
00:56:32,147 --> 00:56:33,023
Seriously!

900
00:56:33,607 --> 00:56:34,692
Are you kidding?

901
00:56:34,775 --> 00:56:36,652
At least get some exercise!

902
00:56:37,611 --> 00:56:39,238
Look at the size of your butt!

903
00:56:39,321 --> 00:56:40,322
Goodness!

904
00:57:20,529 --> 00:57:21,989
It's fine.

905
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,410
I can fix this.

906
00:57:29,955 --> 00:57:30,956
I'll change back.

907
00:57:34,418 --> 00:57:35,544
I can do it.

908
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:39,256
Your face suddenly aged?

909
00:57:39,965 --> 00:57:42,301
All of a sudden, I got severely old.

910
00:57:42,384 --> 00:57:44,929
We all have a point
when we suddenly age a few years.

911
00:57:45,012 --> 00:57:48,599
It's not just that.
I change when the sun rises and sets.

912
00:57:48,682 --> 00:57:49,683
I become someone else.

913
00:57:49,767 --> 00:57:51,352
It sounds like menopause to me.

914
00:57:51,435 --> 00:57:52,478
I'm in my twenties.

915
00:57:52,561 --> 00:57:54,188
You have a daughter in her twenties.

916
00:57:54,271 --> 00:57:56,023
Wait, you're in your twenties?

917
00:57:56,106 --> 00:57:57,983
- Wait--
- I'm in my twenties!

918
00:57:58,067 --> 00:57:59,234
Hey, can we help this lady--

919
00:57:59,318 --> 00:58:02,196
I mean, patient in her twenties
with an appointment?

920
00:58:02,279 --> 00:58:04,782
I am in my twenties.
Look at how my skin's changed.

921
00:58:04,865 --> 00:58:06,325
It changes every morning.

922
00:58:06,408 --> 00:58:07,701
Okay, I'll put you down for it.

923
00:58:07,785 --> 00:58:09,161
Hello.

924
00:58:09,244 --> 00:58:10,412
Excuse me?

925
00:58:10,496 --> 00:58:13,207
Will the facial acupuncture
make me younger?

926
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:14,375
Of course, ma'am.

927
00:58:18,712 --> 00:58:20,297
How can I help you, ma'am?

928
00:58:22,299 --> 00:58:23,509
My daughter's waiting.

929
00:58:29,682 --> 00:58:30,599
Like this.

930
00:58:31,266 --> 00:58:34,353
I won't ask for more or less.
I just want it like this.

931
00:58:34,895 --> 00:58:35,938
Ma'am.

932
00:58:36,021 --> 00:58:37,856
Because of your age,

933
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:39,775
it's hard to look exactly like that.

934
00:58:39,858 --> 00:58:41,902
I told you we're the same age.

935
00:59:05,384 --> 00:59:07,219
Seriously, what am I going to do?

936
00:59:08,053 --> 00:59:09,930
I'm in my twenties.

937
00:59:10,014 --> 00:59:11,682
I was born in 1996.

938
00:59:11,765 --> 00:59:14,601
But I change into this when I wake up.

939
00:59:15,561 --> 00:59:16,395
What?

940
00:59:17,521 --> 00:59:19,273
I change into this in the morning.

941
00:59:19,356 --> 00:59:20,566
To someone born in 1996?

942
00:59:20,649 --> 00:59:22,735
No, the other way around.

943
00:59:22,818 --> 00:59:24,403
- That's the same thing.
- No--

944
00:59:24,486 --> 00:59:25,696
- You're possessed.
- I am?

945
00:59:25,779 --> 00:59:26,947
Let's find a way.

946
00:59:28,032 --> 00:59:30,826
Show me.

947
00:59:30,909 --> 00:59:32,619
Show me the way.

948
00:59:32,703 --> 00:59:35,789
Show me.

949
00:59:36,749 --> 00:59:38,042
Why can't I see it?

950
00:59:38,125 --> 00:59:39,793
Show me.

951
00:59:39,877 --> 00:59:42,838
The spirits are angry. I can't see.

952
00:59:42,921 --> 00:59:46,091
Show me.

953
00:59:46,175 --> 00:59:49,845
Here. Show me the way.

954
00:59:55,059 --> 00:59:56,435
My goodness!

955
00:59:56,518 --> 00:59:57,644
Jeez, you scared me!

956
00:59:57,728 --> 00:59:59,688
- Who are you?
- The person born in 1996.

957
00:59:59,772 --> 01:00:01,106
Don't be ridiculous.

958
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:02,191
Where did the lady go?

959
01:00:02,316 --> 01:00:03,150
- She was--
- I'm her.

960
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:04,318
Get out. Who are you?

961
01:00:04,401 --> 01:00:05,861
I don't want to know. Go!

962
01:00:05,944 --> 01:00:07,237
Go away!

963
01:00:07,321 --> 01:00:09,073
- But…
- Go away! Go!

964
01:00:09,156 --> 01:00:10,032
Go away!

965
01:01:01,959 --> 01:01:03,794
Why?

966
01:01:05,254 --> 01:01:07,714
What did I do wrong?

967
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:13,178
Why do I have to be
an old lady like this? Why?

968
01:01:19,935 --> 01:01:21,311
Is someone listening?

969
01:01:22,771 --> 01:01:23,772
It was my fault?

970
01:01:24,731 --> 01:01:26,483
Are you blaming me?

971
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:30,112
So it is my fault.

972
01:01:31,446 --> 01:01:32,906
I'm the one to blame.

973
01:01:42,916 --> 01:01:44,209
What in the world?

974
01:01:44,293 --> 01:01:46,670
My goodness!

975
01:01:49,047 --> 01:01:50,048
My gosh!

976
01:01:53,552 --> 01:01:54,469
Damn.

977
01:01:54,553 --> 01:01:55,971
I almost died.

978
01:01:57,973 --> 01:01:59,057
What is this?

979
01:02:14,531 --> 01:02:15,782
My leg!

980
01:02:15,866 --> 01:02:16,909
I have a cramp!

981
01:02:22,414 --> 01:02:23,457
What's with her?

982
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:25,125
I feel like seaweed on a beach.

983
01:02:26,835 --> 01:02:31,924
<i>Have you wasted your time doing nothing?</i>

984
01:02:32,716 --> 01:02:36,887
<i>Does your future seem
too bleak to start anew?</i>

985
01:02:37,554 --> 01:02:41,350
<i>As long as you have passion,
anyone can do it.</i>

986
01:02:42,267 --> 01:02:45,646
<i>All ages, genders,
and educational backgrounds are welcome.</i>

987
01:02:46,521 --> 01:02:48,941
<i>Take the challenge now!</i>

988
01:02:49,524 --> 01:02:52,569
<i>We are waiting for you!</i>

989
01:02:52,653 --> 01:02:54,863
<i>Yeah, I can't let it end like this.</i>

990
01:02:54,947 --> 01:02:57,574
<i>I can't give up
without ever getting a job.</i>

991
01:02:57,658 --> 01:03:00,452
<i>Never having a proper job</i>

992
01:03:00,535 --> 01:03:02,663
<i>before turning 30</i>

993
01:03:02,746 --> 01:03:05,582
<i>is a disservice to my weary twenties!</i>

Ms. Lim Sun?

996
01:03:28,647 --> 01:03:29,481
Yes!

997
01:03:29,564 --> 01:03:31,608
- Mr. Ko Deok-hun.
- Yes!

998
01:03:31,692 --> 01:03:33,110
- Ms. Kang I-deok.
- Yes!

999
01:03:33,193 --> 01:03:34,444
- Ms. Baek Hwa-ja.
- Yes!

1000
01:03:34,528 --> 01:03:35,946
Please come in.

1001
01:03:49,084 --> 01:03:50,669
- Ms. Lim Sun.
- Yes, sir?

1002
01:03:51,795 --> 01:03:53,171
You're very young.

1003
01:03:53,255 --> 01:03:54,089
Excuse me?

1004
01:03:54,172 --> 01:03:56,049
You're our youngest applicant.

1005
01:03:57,592 --> 01:03:58,427
I see.

1006
01:04:01,722 --> 01:04:05,350
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck
if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

1007
01:04:06,601 --> 01:04:08,020
Your pronunciation is great.

1008
01:04:08,103 --> 01:04:09,771
These are all my natural teeth.

1009
01:04:12,774 --> 01:04:15,402
I can speak very clearly as well.

1010
01:04:15,485 --> 01:04:16,987
How much wood could…

1011
01:04:17,571 --> 01:04:18,697
- If--
- Thank you.

1012
01:04:25,287 --> 01:04:26,747
You're very flexible.

1013
01:04:27,789 --> 01:04:29,541
I can do other things too.

1014
01:04:29,624 --> 01:04:30,792
Sorry, you can't come out.

1015
01:04:30,876 --> 01:04:31,793
Please go back to…

1016
01:04:39,801 --> 01:04:41,094
On the banner behind me,

1017
01:04:41,178 --> 01:04:44,097
next to where it says
"Seohan City Hall Senior Internship,"

1018
01:04:44,181 --> 01:04:46,600
"Program" is spelled incorrectly.

1019
01:04:46,683 --> 01:04:49,144
It's spelled with an "R,"
not an "L." Right?

1020
01:04:50,103 --> 01:04:51,897
Wow, that's incredible.

1021
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:53,523
Your English is great too.

1022
01:04:53,607 --> 01:04:55,400
You even found that small typo.

1023
01:04:55,484 --> 01:04:59,488
- You must have good vision too.
- Yes, I have naturally perfect vision.

1024
01:05:00,113 --> 01:05:01,907
Do you know any other languages?

1025
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:08,413
Learning a second language
is the first step to globalization!

I got it.

I got the job.

I really did it.

1042

Not me, but Lim Sun did it.

1043

I got the job!

1044
01:08:02,045 --> 01:08:03,755
