1
00:00:09,332 --> 00:00:13,962
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

2
00:00:16,882 --> 00:00:18,383
What the hell?

3
00:00:18,467 --> 00:00:19,634
That's hysterical.

4
00:00:19,718 --> 00:00:21,511
Look at how red his face is!

5
00:00:22,804 --> 00:00:23,805
What's this?

6
00:00:23,889 --> 00:00:25,098
My purse.

7
00:00:25,432 --> 00:00:26,308
Damn it!

8
00:00:28,727 --> 00:00:29,686
What's that?

9
00:00:34,357 --> 00:00:38,111
I can't believe this bitch.
You dare play tricks, you bitch?

10
00:00:39,362 --> 00:00:40,322
The camera!

11
00:00:45,202 --> 00:00:46,203
What's going on?

12
00:00:47,788 --> 00:00:50,332
Let's shoot a real video. Let's do it.

13
00:00:50,415 --> 00:00:51,917
-Hey!
-Stop it!

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,168
-What's with you?
-Stop it!

15
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:55,796
I'm feeling high right now,
so why should I stop?

16
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:57,047
Ms. Lim!

17
00:00:59,883 --> 00:01:00,842
Ms. Lim!

18
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,616
It's empty.

19
00:01:25,534 --> 00:01:26,368
Damn it!

20
00:01:26,451 --> 00:01:28,328
Emergency! It's a crackdown!

21
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:30,038
-It's the cops!
-What?

22
00:01:30,122 --> 00:01:31,456
Hey! Take the drugs!

23
00:01:35,794 --> 00:01:37,295
-Yes, boss.
-What is it?

24
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:38,588
Let's go. Run!

25
00:01:43,635 --> 00:01:44,469
-Who are you?
-What?

26
00:01:44,553 --> 00:01:46,596
-This isn't the bathroom.
-Get out.

27
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,723
That wasn't the bathroom.

28
00:01:58,108 --> 00:01:59,401
What's going on?

29
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:05,031
The person you are trying to call…

30
00:02:07,784 --> 00:02:11,913
Some crazy bastard came here saying
he's a prosecutor from Seohan District.

31
00:02:11,997 --> 00:02:14,082
It was Gye something.

32
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:15,667
Yes, that's right. Gye Ji-ung.

33
00:02:21,256 --> 00:02:23,717
This is a place of business.
You want to go to jail?

34
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,135
They definitely had drugs.

35
00:02:32,893 --> 00:02:36,438
Holy crap!

36
00:02:42,193 --> 00:02:43,028
Wow!

37
00:02:45,113 --> 00:02:46,907
DRUG PATCH

38
00:02:48,116 --> 00:02:49,618
Just a little.

39
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:53,538
Shit!

40
00:02:54,205 --> 00:02:56,249
-My goodness.
-It looks like a rat snuck in.

41
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,879
-Let go.
-I'll gouge your eyes out!

42
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:07,719
You crazy bastard. He's a prosecutor.

43
00:03:07,802 --> 00:03:08,720
Well?

44
00:03:09,554 --> 00:03:10,639
Are you okay, sir?

45
00:03:10,722 --> 00:03:11,973
What do you think?

46
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:17,062
Mr. Gye, you should've said
that you were coming.

47
00:03:17,145 --> 00:03:19,022
I would've prepared the VIP room for you.

48
00:03:19,105 --> 00:03:21,858
And I would've had
the Diamond Set all ready.

49
00:03:21,942 --> 00:03:24,236
-Where did you take the old lady?
-What? Old lady?

50
00:03:24,903 --> 00:03:25,987
We don't have old ladies.

51
00:03:26,071 --> 00:03:28,323
The kitchen staff
even knows not to come out.

52
00:03:28,406 --> 00:03:33,370
If you touch a single hair on her head,
you're all dead. Got it?

53
00:03:33,453 --> 00:03:35,747
-Yes, boss.
-I'm not your boss.

54
00:03:40,043 --> 00:03:43,171
Everyone, take care of the stuff.
We're dead if the prosecutor sees.

55
00:03:46,716 --> 00:03:48,218
I was just passing through.

56
00:03:48,301 --> 00:03:49,678
You're not going anywhere.

57
00:03:49,761 --> 00:03:51,429
You won't be able to leave here intact.

58
00:03:52,013 --> 00:03:52,973
Why are you doing this?

59
00:03:55,183 --> 00:03:56,017
Are you a cop?

60
00:03:56,101 --> 00:03:57,102
I'm…

61
00:03:58,144 --> 00:04:00,855
I'm a civil servant!
You'll be in big trouble for this.

62
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,109
Civil servant, my foot! Come on.

63
00:04:05,652 --> 00:04:07,904
Damn it! Hey!

64
00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:11,741
Stop right there, you stupid girl!

65
00:04:11,825 --> 00:04:13,076
Damn it!

66
00:04:14,244 --> 00:04:15,287
You little…

67
00:04:22,335 --> 00:04:23,169
Get off me!

68
00:04:24,838 --> 00:04:26,131
Why you little…

69
00:04:27,299 --> 00:04:28,300
You want to die?

70
00:04:35,181 --> 00:04:36,933
Hey! Come here.

71
00:04:37,017 --> 00:04:38,101
Damn it.

72
00:04:38,184 --> 00:04:40,729
Go away! Go!

73
00:04:45,108 --> 00:04:46,067
Are you okay?

74
00:04:46,651 --> 00:04:47,944
Seriously!

75
00:04:48,028 --> 00:04:49,821
I promise you this.

76
00:04:49,904 --> 00:04:51,573
You won't get out of here alive.

77
00:04:51,656 --> 00:04:55,243
Get away from me!

78
00:04:57,329 --> 00:04:58,455
This crazy bitch.

79
00:04:58,538 --> 00:05:02,500
Wow, you're making this such a hassle.
Damn it. Hey, come here!

80
00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:07,547
-Ms. Lee Mi-jin?
-Mr. Gye.

81
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,591
What are you doing here? Who are you?

82
00:05:10,842 --> 00:05:11,926
Are you a prosecutor?

83
00:05:12,635 --> 00:05:14,012
Wait. What's going on here?

84
00:05:14,095 --> 00:05:16,347
Yes, room three? Okay.

85
00:05:17,348 --> 00:05:19,059
The fruit platter's on the way.

86
00:05:19,142 --> 00:05:20,935
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

87
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:22,020
Why are you here?

88
00:05:23,813 --> 00:05:25,565
I dropped my phone.

89
00:05:25,648 --> 00:05:27,025
-What?
-What?

90
00:05:27,942 --> 00:05:31,112
Wait, did you see someone
in a beige coat around here?

91
00:05:31,196 --> 00:05:32,447
No, I didn't.

92
00:05:33,364 --> 00:05:35,366
Where did she go?

93
00:05:37,118 --> 00:05:38,328
MS. LIM SUN

94
00:05:50,298 --> 00:05:51,716
PROSECUTOR GYE JI-UNG

95
00:05:53,885 --> 00:05:55,303
MS. LIM SUN

96
00:05:55,386 --> 00:05:59,724
Mr. Gye, I suddenly got
chest pains and left. I'm sorry!

97
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,894
I told her not to come out.

98
00:06:08,108 --> 00:06:09,234
By the way, it's late.

99
00:06:09,317 --> 00:06:10,360
Why are you here?

100
00:06:12,654 --> 00:06:13,696
Go home now!

101
00:06:14,906 --> 00:06:17,200
I want to go home too.

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,627
Is it a special day today?

103
00:06:29,671 --> 00:06:32,549
Yes, well…

104
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,176
Yes, it is.

105
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,427
What day is it today?

106
00:06:38,596 --> 00:06:39,597
Wait.

107
00:06:44,978 --> 00:06:46,396
The doors are closing.

108
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,377
I'm fine though.

109
00:07:09,461 --> 00:07:10,545
Thank you.

110
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,554
Can you hold this for a second?

111
00:07:23,475 --> 00:07:24,934
Thank you for the coat.

112
00:07:28,271 --> 00:07:30,398
-Goodness. I'm so sorry.
-It's okay.

113
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:33,067
Thank you.

114
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:35,945
It's the first floor.

115
00:07:42,202 --> 00:07:44,412
CLUB HOVAN
PROPER ATTIRE REQUIRED

116
00:07:45,872 --> 00:07:47,665
-Have a good night, boss!
-Good night!

117
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:49,042
Jeez, that's a bit much.

118
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,044
Please come again, boss.

119
00:07:51,127 --> 00:07:53,254
We'll give you
the very best service, boss.

120
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,798
Boss, we'll do whatever you ask next time!

121
00:07:55,882 --> 00:07:56,758
I'm the youngest.

122
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:57,967
I can drive you, boss.

123
00:07:58,551 --> 00:07:59,886
Mr. Gye!

124
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,349
I could've handled everything
if I'd gone in.

125
00:08:04,432 --> 00:08:05,266
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,143
I think you would've been handled.

127
00:08:07,727 --> 00:08:09,395
-Sir?
-Let's go.

128
00:08:16,361 --> 00:08:18,238
Attention!
Greet the prosecutor as he leaves!

129
00:08:18,821 --> 00:08:19,781
-Thank you!
-Good night!

130
00:08:19,864 --> 00:08:21,616
Don't do that. Go inside.

131
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:22,700
Stop it.

132
00:08:23,993 --> 00:08:25,245
Son of a bitch.

133
00:08:25,328 --> 00:08:26,496
Damn it!

134
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:27,872
Damn.

135
00:08:27,956 --> 00:08:30,792
They know the prosecutors' office
is watching now.

136
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,001
They'll start to move.

137
00:08:33,044 --> 00:08:34,754
We'll have to keep an eye on them.

138
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:38,675
Are you sure
you don't want to report this?

139
00:08:38,758 --> 00:08:41,970
Yes, I'm totally fine.

140
00:08:42,053 --> 00:08:46,808
Yes, and we're investigating now,
so it's better to stop here for tonight.

141
00:08:46,891 --> 00:08:48,142
-Yes.
-But…

142
00:08:48,893 --> 00:08:52,730
Where's Ms. Lim,
and who's this beautiful young lady?

143
00:08:53,648 --> 00:08:55,900
She suddenly got chest pains.

144
00:08:58,444 --> 00:09:01,447
The person saying she was born
in the '90s suddenly had chest pains?

145
00:09:02,574 --> 00:09:05,034
I don't know. Anyway, great work.

146
00:09:05,118 --> 00:09:06,286
I'll escort her home.

147
00:09:06,369 --> 00:09:07,370
-What?
-Let's go.

148
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,001
What in the world?

149
00:09:15,878 --> 00:09:17,463
Was he really seeing someone?

150
00:09:21,634 --> 00:09:23,469
Once again, thank you.

151
00:09:24,887 --> 00:09:25,763
Are you really okay?

152
00:09:27,056 --> 00:09:28,975
Yes, thanks to you.

153
00:09:29,058 --> 00:09:30,935
Do you have
the self-defense tools I gave you?

154
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:32,520
Of course. Here.

155
00:09:33,938 --> 00:09:35,315
Then, why didn't you use them?

156
00:09:35,398 --> 00:09:37,275
They're for dangerous situations
like today.

157
00:09:38,901 --> 00:09:39,736
Well…

158
00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:42,238
It feels bad to use them on civilians…

159
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,116
They're not civilians. They're assailants.

160
00:09:46,701 --> 00:09:48,202
But I'm the victim, so why are you…

161
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,123
Are you angry?

162
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,836
I'm not angry, but I'm right.

163
00:09:57,962 --> 00:09:59,881
You said you don't care about others.

164
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,259
But technically, you're not just anyone.

165
00:10:06,095 --> 00:10:08,473
Then, who am I?

166
00:10:09,098 --> 00:10:11,851
I guess you're a witness,
and I'm your proxy.

167
00:10:13,353 --> 00:10:14,646
What is that?

168
00:10:20,818 --> 00:10:22,820
By the way, I'm curious about something.

169
00:10:22,904 --> 00:10:25,114
What did you save me in your phone as?

170
00:10:27,033 --> 00:10:29,535
It's just saved as your name.

171
00:10:29,619 --> 00:10:30,912
Can you show me?

172
00:10:31,871 --> 00:10:34,248
That's fresh coming from someone
who blocked me.

173
00:10:34,332 --> 00:10:35,208
I mean…

174
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:36,793
I know.

175
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,670
So can you show me?

176
00:10:39,253 --> 00:10:40,588
Why do you want to see it?

177
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,800
Something's fishy.

178
00:10:44,384 --> 00:10:45,593
Let me see.

179
00:10:45,676 --> 00:10:47,470
No, I'm driving right now.

180
00:10:47,553 --> 00:10:49,639
Okay, since you're driving,

181
00:10:49,722 --> 00:10:51,682
I'll check it on my own.

182
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:52,934
I'll see for myself.

183
00:10:55,228 --> 00:10:57,105
DOCUMENTS

184
00:10:57,897 --> 00:10:59,357
Wow!

185
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,901
Wow! "Documents"!

186
00:11:01,984 --> 00:11:04,487
Since when was my name "Documents"?

187
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,447
Hello, I'm Lee Documents.

188
00:11:07,448 --> 00:11:09,951
I was going to change it later,
but I forgot.

189
00:11:10,034 --> 00:11:13,621
That's fresh coming from someone
who scolded me for blocking them.

190
00:11:14,455 --> 00:11:16,582
What should I save you as?

191
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,793
Yeah, "Witness" and "Proxy"
seems suitable.

192
00:11:18,876 --> 00:11:20,002
"Witness" and "Proxy."

193
00:11:20,086 --> 00:11:21,921
Jeez, you're so immature.

194
00:11:22,004 --> 00:11:23,881
Yes, I'm very immature. I'm Lee Immature.

195
00:11:30,596 --> 00:11:31,722
We almost died!

196
00:11:31,806 --> 00:11:33,015
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

197
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:34,058
Yes.

198
00:11:35,017 --> 00:11:37,770
-Wait.
-I don't think we can get out.

199
00:11:37,854 --> 00:11:40,064
Don't! Stop.

200
00:11:40,148 --> 00:11:42,900
We have to get out of here.
Just wait. Don't be nervous.

201
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:46,779
Stop! Don't!

202
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,323
-We're in mud.
-Wait.

203
00:11:49,407 --> 00:11:51,534
-Just wait.
-I'll get out too. I'm scared.

204
00:11:57,748 --> 00:11:59,083
It's totally stuck.

205
00:12:01,461 --> 00:12:02,503
My goodness.

206
00:12:03,921 --> 00:12:05,339
What do we do?

207
00:12:05,882 --> 00:12:06,716
Can you drive?

208
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,551
Yes, I have a license.

209
00:12:08,634 --> 00:12:10,178
-Get in the driver's seat.
-Me?

210
00:12:11,637 --> 00:12:13,014
I'm really getting in then.

211
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,186
-Step on it.
-Okay.

212
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:19,687
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

213
00:12:22,231 --> 00:12:23,232
Step on it harder!

214
00:12:23,316 --> 00:12:24,400
One, two, three!

215
00:12:25,485 --> 00:12:26,569
Harder!

216
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,004
-Goodness!
-Goodness!

217
00:12:46,088 --> 00:12:46,923
Mi-jin!

218
00:12:47,006 --> 00:12:49,425
-Mom!
-Goodness, my girl! What's going on?

219
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:51,052
Are you okay? Were you hurt?

220
00:12:51,135 --> 00:12:52,470
-I'm fine.
-Are you…

221
00:12:52,553 --> 00:12:55,139
Goodness gracious! What happened to you?

222
00:12:55,223 --> 00:12:56,974
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, Dad.

223
00:12:57,558 --> 00:13:00,811
-What happened to your face?
-Ga-yeong practiced putting makeup on me.

224
00:13:00,895 --> 00:13:02,480
I see. But you're okay?

225
00:13:02,563 --> 00:13:03,439
-Yeah.
-Okay.

226
00:13:03,523 --> 00:13:04,899
You can't go anywhere like this!

227
00:13:04,982 --> 00:13:07,652
Our house is close by.
You can wash up there.

228
00:13:08,236 --> 00:13:09,237
No, that's fine.

229
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,822
No, it's not.
It's not fine with me. Let's go.

230
00:13:11,906 --> 00:13:13,115
Let's hurry.

231
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:15,701
Yeah, get on.

232
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:21,958
Honey, step on it.

233
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,292
We should drive safely.

234
00:13:25,795 --> 00:13:28,464
-Are they okay back there?
-Yeah, just fine.

235
00:13:29,048 --> 00:13:30,466
This is nice.

236
00:13:31,384 --> 00:13:33,386
I would've brought the car had I known.

237
00:13:34,053 --> 00:13:35,137
-Right?
-Yeah.

238
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:50,861
I put clothes outside the door,
so you can get changed.

239
00:13:50,945 --> 00:13:52,113
Yes, sir.

240
00:13:54,073 --> 00:13:56,117
Stop acting like this.

241
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,952
Also, why do you keep bringing him home?

242
00:13:58,035 --> 00:14:00,705
You wanted me to just send him home
looking like that?

243
00:14:01,664 --> 00:14:04,208
You have absolutely no compassion.

244
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:06,419
No, this will make him more uncomfortable.

245
00:14:06,502 --> 00:14:07,461
That's not it!

246
00:14:09,755 --> 00:14:10,590
What do we do?

247
00:14:11,966 --> 00:14:13,968
Just shut up and go clean your room.

248
00:14:14,051 --> 00:14:15,595
Why do I have to clean my room?

249
00:14:15,678 --> 00:14:19,015
Make sure your body and mind
are always neat and clean!

250
00:14:19,098 --> 00:14:20,141
Your room too! Go!

251
00:14:20,224 --> 00:14:21,893
Jeez, you're embarrassing me!

252
00:14:21,976 --> 00:14:25,688
I endured for eight years while my one
and only daughter was semi-employed.

253
00:14:25,771 --> 00:14:27,064
Why would you be embarrassed?

254
00:14:27,148 --> 00:14:28,399
It's not that.

255
00:14:28,482 --> 00:14:30,568
It's embarrassing when you act like this!

256
00:14:30,651 --> 00:14:31,569
You brat!

257
00:14:35,448 --> 00:14:38,367
My goodness.
Those are the clothes I put in the hamper.

258
00:14:38,451 --> 00:14:40,494
It's a perfect fit. Right, Dad?

259
00:14:40,578 --> 00:14:44,206
It must be your good looks,
because those colors really suit you too.

260
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,250
It looks better on him than you!

261
00:14:48,002 --> 00:14:49,295
I'll head out now.

262
00:14:49,378 --> 00:14:51,339
Already? You're dripping water!

263
00:14:51,422 --> 00:14:53,257
Honey. Get a plastic bag.

264
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:54,926
-Where?
-The kitchen!

265
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:55,885
The kitchen.

266
00:14:56,802 --> 00:14:57,845
I'm sorry.

267
00:14:58,387 --> 00:15:00,640
Here you go. Put them in here.

268
00:15:01,557 --> 00:15:03,309
-Slowly.
-Okay.

269
00:15:03,392 --> 00:15:04,560
Easy.

270
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,021
-Thank you.
-Here you go.

271
00:15:07,563 --> 00:15:11,943
Well, I'd really like to make you
something to eat before you go.

272
00:15:12,026 --> 00:15:14,695
-Is it too late?
-It's okay. You've done so much already.

273
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:16,197
Wait!

274
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,406
No, it's fine…

275
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,995
Here. Take this with you.

276
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:24,830
-It's fine.
-Please.

277
00:15:24,914 --> 00:15:28,584
From now on,
saying "It's fine" will be prohibited.

278
00:15:29,168 --> 00:15:30,211
Here. Take it.

279
00:15:31,003 --> 00:15:32,254
Thank you.

280
00:15:32,338 --> 00:15:35,841
You stopped something bad from happening
to Mi-jin at the playground.

281
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:37,843
I wanted to show my thanks.

282
00:15:37,927 --> 00:15:39,470
-Playground?
-The playground.

283
00:15:39,553 --> 00:15:42,223
The fun, exciting, and spectacular
playground for adults…

284
00:15:42,306 --> 00:15:45,685
She's gotten older,
but she's still immature.

285
00:15:45,768 --> 00:15:49,021
From now on, don't think
of leaving this house at night. Got it?

286
00:15:49,689 --> 00:15:51,482
-That hurt.
-That's why I hit you.

287
00:15:51,565 --> 00:15:54,276
How old are you?
Why would you go to a playground--

288
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,237
What are you doing in front of our guest?

289
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,328
I'll really get going. Thank you.

290
00:16:04,412 --> 00:16:06,372
Yes, of course.

291
00:16:06,455 --> 00:16:07,999
-Take care.
-All right.

292
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,334
Good night.

293
00:16:13,254 --> 00:16:15,464
Honey, did you just yell at me?

294
00:16:21,804 --> 00:16:23,514
-Mr. Gye!
-Can you help me?

295
00:16:23,597 --> 00:16:24,807
I can't open the door.

296
00:16:28,811 --> 00:16:30,104
I guess I forgot my jacket.

297
00:16:30,187 --> 00:16:31,397
Yes, here.

298
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,565
Put it on top here.

299
00:16:33,482 --> 00:16:35,651
I'll do this then.

300
00:16:38,487 --> 00:16:39,405
Thank you.

301
00:16:40,072 --> 00:16:41,449
About earlier…

302
00:16:41,991 --> 00:16:44,368
Thanks for not saying anything to my mom.

303
00:16:45,036 --> 00:16:48,414
I unintentionally keep lying
to your parents.

304
00:16:48,497 --> 00:16:49,707
I lied about the job scam too.

305
00:16:52,585 --> 00:16:53,586
I mean…

306
00:16:54,837 --> 00:16:57,715
Well, that's why it's called a white lie.

307
00:16:57,798 --> 00:17:00,384
I don't know.
If the lie is only for your sake,

308
00:17:00,468 --> 00:17:02,261
is it still considered a white lie?

309
00:17:02,344 --> 00:17:04,638
Can you just let it go?

310
00:17:04,722 --> 00:17:07,058
If I'm not persistent,
I shouldn't be a prosecutor.

311
00:17:07,141 --> 00:17:08,934
Yeah, good for you.

312
00:17:09,018 --> 00:17:12,313
-Are you being sarcastic?
-No way. I wouldn't dare.

313
00:17:12,396 --> 00:17:14,565
-I think you are.
-Gosh, no.

314
00:17:14,648 --> 00:17:16,692
Being sarcastic would be…

315
00:17:22,406 --> 00:17:24,742
Mr. Gye, those pants
look really good on you.

316
00:17:25,451 --> 00:17:26,285
They fit perfectly.

317
00:17:26,368 --> 00:17:28,120
You know what? I should tell your parents.

318
00:17:28,204 --> 00:17:30,873
I'm really sorry. I mean that.

319
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,001
How does it look?

320
00:17:34,085 --> 00:17:35,795
-I think you're still being sarcastic.
-No.

321
00:17:35,878 --> 00:17:39,924
No matter how you look at it,
I think your clothes look better on him.

322
00:17:40,007 --> 00:17:42,009
I meant about Mi-jin!

323
00:17:44,178 --> 00:17:47,598
Still, he's a prosecutor.

324
00:17:47,681 --> 00:17:49,683
So? What's wrong with Mi-jin?

325
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:51,894
Are you saying
she's not on the same level as him?

326
00:17:51,977 --> 00:17:53,729
How could you say that
about your daughter?

327
00:17:53,813 --> 00:17:56,148
I can say that because she's my daughter.

328
00:17:56,232 --> 00:17:58,901
What if Mi-jin ends up getting hurt?

329
00:17:58,984 --> 00:18:01,362
-I'm leaving.
-Good night.

330
00:18:03,781 --> 00:18:05,950
This won't do. You take the back.

331
00:18:06,033 --> 00:18:07,493
I'll take the front.

332
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:10,037
-The back?
-Yeah.

333
00:18:10,121 --> 00:18:12,832
I'll attack first from the front,

334
00:18:12,915 --> 00:18:15,417
and you block him
from the back so he can't escape.

335
00:18:15,501 --> 00:18:17,711
Come on. Would that even work?

336
00:18:22,383 --> 00:18:24,260
I just have to block the back, right?

337
00:18:24,343 --> 00:18:25,427
-That's right.
-Okay.

338
00:19:45,257 --> 00:19:47,426
Wow.

339
00:19:48,969 --> 00:19:51,513
Weren't you looking
for a pain-relief patch? Here.

340
00:19:52,932 --> 00:19:53,807
Want me to help?

341
00:19:54,391 --> 00:19:56,143
Yeah, right here.

342
00:19:56,227 --> 00:19:57,228
Come here.

343
00:19:58,938 --> 00:20:00,314
Here, Mom.

344
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,358
-Here. Yeah.
-Here?

345
00:20:02,983 --> 00:20:05,236
-Is it here?
-Yeah, my shoulder.

346
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:08,072
Goodness gracious.
What have you been doing out there?

347
00:20:08,155 --> 00:20:10,783
I was in the middle of work.

348
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:13,160
-Goodness.
-Thanks.

349
00:20:14,745 --> 00:20:15,996
Are you happy you're working?

350
00:20:16,413 --> 00:20:19,124
Of course.

351
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,126
Then, why are you making that face?

352
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,087
Because it could end someday.

353
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:26,674
What are you saying? You know what's great
about being a civil servant?

354
00:20:26,757 --> 00:20:28,801
You stay employed until retirement.

355
00:20:31,303 --> 00:20:33,222
-I'm tired.
-Lie down.

356
00:20:33,305 --> 00:20:34,932
-Your legs too?
-Yeah.

357
00:20:36,016 --> 00:20:37,893
-Mom?
-Yeah?

358
00:20:37,977 --> 00:20:39,478
Now that I'm working,

359
00:20:39,561 --> 00:20:43,107
I now understand that saying,
"You're only as old as you feel."

360
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,734
What? Are you saying you're old?

361
00:20:45,818 --> 00:20:47,486
-Why are you old?
-I mean…

362
00:20:48,862 --> 00:20:50,990
-The soles of my feet are old.
-Good grief.

363
00:20:51,073 --> 00:20:52,491
-They're so tired.
-You brat.

364
00:20:53,575 --> 00:20:56,996
Did having a job make you grow up?
How do you know how an old person feels?

365
00:20:59,164 --> 00:21:01,792
Right? How would I know
how old people feel?

366
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,085
So weird.

367
00:21:03,168 --> 00:21:04,920
Mom, stop. Your wrists will hurt.

368
00:21:05,004 --> 00:21:06,130
Stay still, you brat.

369
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:08,841
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

370
00:21:13,512 --> 00:21:14,555
It's about Ms. Lim.

371
00:21:15,222 --> 00:21:16,890
If she left because she felt ill,

372
00:21:16,974 --> 00:21:19,310
wouldn't working here
also be too much for her?

373
00:21:19,393 --> 00:21:21,020
That's what I think.

374
00:21:21,812 --> 00:21:22,771
I wonder if she's okay?

375
00:21:22,855 --> 00:21:25,649
I knew it. I should've gone in!

376
00:21:28,152 --> 00:21:29,903
This is why you can't ignore age.

377
00:21:30,988 --> 00:21:32,990
But you couldn't even get in the door.

378
00:21:33,741 --> 00:21:36,035
And the original plan
was to go through the back.

379
00:21:37,953 --> 00:21:39,621
You couldn't get in there either?

380
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,377
It doesn't matter which door it was.

381
00:21:48,547 --> 00:21:50,090
I'll show you how good I am!

382
00:21:50,174 --> 00:21:53,469
I'll show you my skills
as an investigator!

383
00:21:53,552 --> 00:21:56,221
You heard me, right?
Can you hear me? My skills!

384
00:21:56,305 --> 00:21:58,640
I'll show you all my skills!
No need to answer!

385
00:21:58,724 --> 00:21:59,767
Because this is…

386
00:22:13,864 --> 00:22:16,492
I'm so sorry about last night.

387
00:22:16,575 --> 00:22:18,994
We heard you were feeling ill.
How are you?

388
00:22:19,578 --> 00:22:23,082
My heart suddenly felt
like it was being squeezed.

389
00:22:23,165 --> 00:22:24,083
-Like this.
-Gosh.

390
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:26,376
I think you overstrained yourself.

391
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,795
You look terrible.

392
00:22:27,878 --> 00:22:29,296
Thankfully, I got pictures.

393
00:22:29,379 --> 00:22:30,464
Here…

394
00:22:30,547 --> 00:22:32,466
Don't overdo it! Take it easy.

395
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:33,926
-Easy.
-It's okay. Sit down.

396
00:22:34,009 --> 00:22:35,177
Okay.

397
00:22:46,188 --> 00:22:49,066
But I can't see their faces,
so it'll be hard to identify them.

398
00:22:49,149 --> 00:22:50,317
What about the VIP room ones?

399
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,444
I was caught then…

400
00:22:52,528 --> 00:22:55,614
You were taking these secretly,
so no wonder your heart was taxed.

401
00:22:56,281 --> 00:22:58,033
But how did you get in the VIP room?

402
00:23:00,327 --> 00:23:01,203
Come on.

403
00:23:01,286 --> 00:23:03,163
I told you to leave that room.

404
00:23:03,247 --> 00:23:05,582
Yeah, sure. I'm sure you did.

405
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:07,960
I said it
since you suddenly said you went in.

406
00:23:08,043 --> 00:23:09,586
Yeah, sure. I'm sure you did.

407
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,880
-Like this.
-Are you pushing?

408
00:23:11,964 --> 00:23:13,465
-Let's talk.
-What? Why?

409
00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:14,716
Bye.

410
00:23:17,678 --> 00:23:18,971
Damn, the quality is…

411
00:23:19,847 --> 00:23:21,849
It looks fine. Can't he tell who it is?

412
00:23:25,561 --> 00:23:27,187
Still, it was too much.

413
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,274
You want her to voluntarily quit,
but there's a line.

414
00:23:30,357 --> 00:23:33,902
I mean, she was so startled
she had chest pains.

415
00:23:35,529 --> 00:23:38,907
Are you saying I made her do this
to kick her out? By myself?

416
00:23:39,867 --> 00:23:41,660
-Isn't it true?
-No!

417
00:23:41,743 --> 00:23:44,163
You were in on it with me.
You're so shameless.

418
00:23:44,246 --> 00:23:48,167
I wasn't that bad! You did this to her
on your own. Don't lie.

419
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:51,753
Jeez, we'll have to stop her
if she wants to quit now.

420
00:23:51,837 --> 00:23:54,339
She's going to keel over before she quits.

421
00:23:54,423 --> 00:23:57,050
There's no time for this.
Let's look for their clients.

422
00:23:59,761 --> 00:24:02,598
Yeah, sure. Because your work
comes first even in this situation.

423
00:24:02,681 --> 00:24:04,892
And don't make any more plans from now on.

424
00:24:04,975 --> 00:24:07,019
Yeah, sure. I'll just do my work.

425
00:24:09,271 --> 00:24:12,024
Do senior public interns
clean this area too?

426
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:43,764
The dashboard camera.

427
00:24:51,146 --> 00:24:53,732
Mr. Baek, aren't you tired?

428
00:24:53,815 --> 00:24:58,862
Goodness, this work is too hard
for someone like you, isn't it?

429
00:24:58,946 --> 00:25:00,614
I bet you're tired.

430
00:25:00,697 --> 00:25:02,241
Do you want me to help?

431
00:25:02,324 --> 00:25:04,117
I'll gradually get used to it.

432
00:25:04,201 --> 00:25:05,911
Moving around
makes it feel like a workout.

433
00:25:05,994 --> 00:25:07,162
It's nice.

434
00:25:07,246 --> 00:25:12,376
Gosh, some work to make a living,
while others do it for fun.

435
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,961
Jeez.

436
00:25:14,044 --> 00:25:16,922
By the way,
it seems the youngest intern is busy.

437
00:25:17,005 --> 00:25:18,340
I haven't seen her around.

438
00:25:18,423 --> 00:25:20,676
Why bring her up? She's not even here.

439
00:25:21,802 --> 00:25:24,763
She thinks she's important
working for the prosecutor now,

440
00:25:24,846 --> 00:25:26,598
and she doesn't hang out with us.

441
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:29,810
She looked young. How incredible of her.

442
00:25:29,893 --> 00:25:31,228
She took on office tasks.

443
00:25:31,311 --> 00:25:34,564
-Incredible, my foot.
-It is incredible!

444
00:25:34,648 --> 00:25:36,483
It's very incredible.

445
00:25:36,566 --> 00:25:39,486
She even caught a terrorist
cops or prosecutors couldn't catch!

446
00:25:39,569 --> 00:25:42,572
-Fine, it's incredible.
-It is!

447
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:46,952
This place only recognizes skills.
All right?

448
00:25:47,035 --> 00:25:49,997
Whatever you did elsewhere
or however successful you were,

449
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,832
it doesn't matter at all.

450
00:25:51,915 --> 00:25:53,375
Why not? It's important.

451
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:56,586
-It's so important!
-I used to be successful too!

452
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,046
Who says you weren't?

453
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,674
-So just keep doing your job.
-Why are you yelling at me?

454
00:26:03,677 --> 00:26:05,178
-What's going on?
-Who's that?

455
00:26:09,433 --> 00:26:12,269
I got the dashcam footage
from the cars as you requested.

456
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,896
But why? We already have
high-resolution CCTV footage.

457
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,816
-Ji Dong-kwon's movements are strange.
-They are?

458
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:21,987
I didn't see anything.

459
00:26:22,571 --> 00:26:26,074
In past videos, he'd look around
at autograph signing events

460
00:26:26,158 --> 00:26:28,410
and wait for Ko Won
before approaching him.

461
00:26:28,493 --> 00:26:30,162
Yeah, that's usually the norm.

462
00:26:30,245 --> 00:26:33,040
Inspect the site, find the target,
and commit the crime.

463
00:26:33,123 --> 00:26:36,460
-But the sequence was different this time.
-How so?

464
00:26:47,596 --> 00:26:50,307
The parking lot is quiet, secluded,
and even allows a way out.

465
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,476
Why leave the perfect spot for a crime

466
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,229
and choose the crowded area
in front of the lobby?

467
00:26:56,313 --> 00:26:59,066
I guess he wanted the world
to see his crime?

468
00:26:59,149 --> 00:27:01,401
A normal criminal would've done that,

469
00:27:01,485 --> 00:27:06,073
but what would drug addicts
like Ji Dong-kwon be afraid of the most?

470
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,451
-Being unable to do drugs again.
-Okay, then.

471
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,413
Why commit a crime
at the risk of being arrested?

472
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,666
His goal…

473
00:27:19,252 --> 00:27:20,253
It wasn't Ko Won.

474
00:27:22,923 --> 00:27:25,675
Then, why would he do this?

475
00:27:27,552 --> 00:27:28,970
Well…

476
00:27:32,432 --> 00:27:34,393
I'm sure only Ji Dong-kwon knows that.

477
00:27:35,352 --> 00:27:37,896
Ko Won wasn't the target
for the acid, was he?

478
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,776
At first, I was sure
you were after Ko Won.

479
00:27:42,859 --> 00:27:46,530
You were sentenced to prison thanks to him
and there's immense resentment.

480
00:27:46,613 --> 00:27:50,575
But it was actually others
who were harmed.

481
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:53,412
It's all because of her.

482
00:27:53,954 --> 00:27:57,374
That damn old lady ruined everything!

483
00:28:00,627 --> 00:28:02,170
What the hell are you saying?

484
00:28:04,548 --> 00:28:06,550
Bring Ko Won to me now.

485
00:28:08,885 --> 00:28:10,387
I'll kill him for you.

486
00:28:11,179 --> 00:28:14,766
After committing such a crime,
you knew it could ruin your life.

487
00:28:15,767 --> 00:28:18,687
Did you find a boss
who'd supply you drugs forever?

488
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,480
I told you it's not like that…

489
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,317
Are you goddamn deaf?

490
00:28:27,112 --> 00:28:29,322
You've been sober,
but you keep talking nonsense.

491
00:28:29,406 --> 00:28:31,074
It sounds like you don't want to talk.

492
00:28:31,658 --> 00:28:34,494
I get it, so let's wrap it up.
I think I have my answers.

493
00:28:34,578 --> 00:28:35,454
Goodness.

494
00:28:35,537 --> 00:28:36,371
Sure.

495
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:41,418
Did you hear something?

496
00:28:42,085 --> 00:28:42,961
What?

497
00:28:43,754 --> 00:28:44,921
You changed your mind?

498
00:28:47,257 --> 00:28:49,009
I'll give you time to think.

499
00:28:49,718 --> 00:28:51,887
Why protect a shameless instigator

500
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:54,681
who turned you into a terrorist
for just some drugs?

501
00:29:10,989 --> 00:29:13,283
You monitor all the inmates' calls, right?

502
00:29:13,366 --> 00:29:15,368
Yes, their calls are all recorded.

503
00:29:15,452 --> 00:29:16,870
Called numbers are checked too.

504
00:29:16,953 --> 00:29:18,205
Watch him closely.

505
00:29:18,288 --> 00:29:20,791
Call me if he shows any strange behavior.

506
00:29:26,546 --> 00:29:28,632
I think he knows.

507
00:29:29,966 --> 00:29:31,927
Damn it, you still don't get it.

508
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:34,429
I'm about to take the fall for everything!

509
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,308
I won't go down alone.

510
00:29:38,391 --> 00:29:40,018
Why the hell would I?

511
00:29:41,561 --> 00:29:44,564
Before I expose
why you tried to kill that person,

512
00:29:45,816 --> 00:29:47,150
handle it now.

513
00:30:02,249 --> 00:30:05,043
CLEAN UP YOUR OWN MESS

514
00:30:28,108 --> 00:30:29,609
The iced coffee lover!

515
00:30:30,777 --> 00:30:31,945
Thank you.

516
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:40,287
I should be thanking you.

517
00:30:41,371 --> 00:30:45,333
You didn't give advice,
recommendations, or consolation.

518
00:30:48,628 --> 00:30:50,005
I hate "Back in my day" stuff.

519
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,966
And who cares
what strangers say about you?

520
00:30:53,049 --> 00:30:54,050
It's not important.

521
00:30:57,387 --> 00:30:59,139
Being obsessed with hate comments.

522
00:31:00,307 --> 00:31:01,558
It's pathetic, right?

523
00:31:04,728 --> 00:31:05,937
Can I be honest?

524
00:31:13,028 --> 00:31:14,070
I'm ready.

525
00:31:17,032 --> 00:31:18,742
I thought you were different.

526
00:31:19,576 --> 00:31:20,994
You had a comfortable life.

527
00:31:21,745 --> 00:31:25,248
Some people out here have it rough,
but you had it made.

528
00:31:25,332 --> 00:31:29,502
The most useless thing to worry about was
a celebrity like you who had an easy life.

529
00:31:32,047 --> 00:31:34,132
That's why I think it's hard on you.

530
00:31:34,674 --> 00:31:36,509
Because that's how everyone looks at you.

531
00:31:54,569 --> 00:31:56,446
Without time to rest

532
00:31:58,406 --> 00:32:00,241
Without time to rest

533
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:05,538
Without time to rest

534
00:32:07,457 --> 00:32:09,709
-This isn't it.
-Okay, let's get this down.

535
00:32:11,419 --> 00:32:13,213
Wow, he does all that in a week?

536
00:32:13,296 --> 00:32:15,507
What? No way. It's his daily schedule.

537
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,424
What?

538
00:32:16,508 --> 00:32:19,970
Hey, when does he eat and sleep?

539
00:32:42,993 --> 00:32:44,411
You can't see it,

540
00:32:44,995 --> 00:32:47,414
but you're trying your best to hold on.

541
00:32:48,707 --> 00:32:50,375
People don't know that.

542
00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:54,587
THE FAST TRACK TO BE
A 7TH-GRADE CIVIL SERVANT

543
00:32:55,964 --> 00:32:59,759
I worked so hard
and didn't rest for a single day.

544
00:33:00,343 --> 00:33:01,344
But…

545
00:33:03,805 --> 00:33:06,266
what do I have to show for it?

546
00:33:09,227 --> 00:33:11,521
They can't see it, so they say that stuff.

547
00:33:17,277 --> 00:33:19,738
Also, that online troll
will get his punishment.

548
00:33:19,821 --> 00:33:23,366
Those who harm others
are destined to have a miserable life.

549
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,122
Everything you say is so typical…

550
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:35,754
but it's nice.

551
00:33:44,971 --> 00:33:45,805
Darn it.

552
00:33:46,389 --> 00:33:47,974
Look at the time!

553
00:33:48,433 --> 00:33:50,518
-I have to go.
-I'll toss it away for you.

554
00:33:50,602 --> 00:33:53,563
No, I used to be a cleaning lady.
I can go and do it.

555
00:33:53,646 --> 00:33:54,856
Just give it. I got it.

556
00:33:54,939 --> 00:33:55,982
-No.
-Give it to me.

557
00:33:56,066 --> 00:33:57,150
That's cold!

558
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:00,361
Just a second. Are you okay?

559
00:34:00,445 --> 00:34:01,446
Yes.

560
00:34:02,614 --> 00:34:04,407
I'm okay. I just need to wipe a bit more.

561
00:34:06,367 --> 00:34:07,494
What's that scar?

562
00:34:08,578 --> 00:34:10,705
I got it as a kid
while playing with a cat.

563
00:34:10,789 --> 00:34:13,166
I know a plastic surgeon
who's good with scars.

564
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:15,710
Doesn't this look like a heart?

565
00:34:16,461 --> 00:34:17,962
It's like my tattoo.

566
00:34:18,046 --> 00:34:19,255
Thanks for today.

567
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,308
Hey.

568
00:34:30,391 --> 00:34:31,726
Hey, it's me.

569
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:34,521
You said you couldn't stand
being in a remote village

570
00:34:34,604 --> 00:34:37,440
filled with terrorists,
so I've been looking into a few things.

571
00:34:37,524 --> 00:34:38,525
I want to stay here.

572
00:34:38,608 --> 00:34:39,567
What?

573
00:34:39,651 --> 00:34:40,902
I like it here.

574
00:34:40,985 --> 00:34:42,529
What are you saying?

575
00:34:42,612 --> 00:34:45,198
You said you were scared
the terrorist might return.

576
00:34:45,281 --> 00:34:48,243
I'm sure someone will help me
if that lunatic shows up again.

577
00:34:48,326 --> 00:34:50,036
Who in the world's going to help?

578
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,705
You said first you were bored
and frustrated in the country.

579
00:34:52,789 --> 00:34:54,541
You said you were losing your mind.

580
00:34:54,624 --> 00:34:56,334
Yeah, but it's become better.

581
00:34:57,127 --> 00:34:59,379
The water's clean. The air's fresh too.

582
00:35:03,466 --> 00:35:04,509
And the people…

583
00:35:06,261 --> 00:35:07,387
are good too.

584
00:35:10,473 --> 00:35:11,432
Hey, Won. Are you…

585
00:35:12,308 --> 00:35:16,563
You know the hardest issues
to deal with… involve women, right?

586
00:35:18,356 --> 00:35:21,025
Why won't you answer me?
Won, are you listening?

587
00:35:21,693 --> 00:35:23,027
Won? Hey?

588
00:35:23,111 --> 00:35:25,363
Hey, I have a favor to ask.

589
00:35:28,783 --> 00:35:31,494
What is this? Come on.

590
00:35:32,495 --> 00:35:34,539
Guard!

591
00:35:35,707 --> 00:35:37,667
Over here! Come quick!

592
00:35:38,877 --> 00:35:40,295
Come on!

593
00:35:40,795 --> 00:35:41,713
In here!

594
00:35:43,339 --> 00:35:45,383
Look at this. Are you insane? Jeez.

595
00:35:45,466 --> 00:35:46,634
What's going on?

596
00:35:46,718 --> 00:35:48,928
-Did you harass him?
-No way!

597
00:35:49,012 --> 00:35:51,472
He suddenly started to vomit
and shout on his own.

598
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:56,769
Let's go. Come on.

599
00:35:57,854 --> 00:35:58,897
When did this start?

600
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,190
Hold his hands and feet tight!

601
00:36:00,273 --> 00:36:01,149
-Yes, doctor!
-Sir!

602
00:36:02,692 --> 00:36:03,902
Just a moment.

603
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,446
I'll prepare the shot.

604
00:36:07,071 --> 00:36:08,281
Hold him tight!

605
00:36:08,364 --> 00:36:09,490
-Yes, sir!
-Hold tight!

606
00:36:09,991 --> 00:36:10,950
Hold him down now!

607
00:36:17,248 --> 00:36:18,374
That should do it.

608
00:36:36,935 --> 00:36:37,977
Don't follow me!

609
00:37:15,348 --> 00:37:18,309
Ji-ung, give me the pink lipstick.

610
00:37:23,231 --> 00:37:24,565
This is orange.

611
00:37:26,693 --> 00:37:28,778
This is pink.

612
00:37:33,324 --> 00:37:34,325
Come here.

613
00:37:38,454 --> 00:37:39,289
Am I pretty?

614
00:37:39,789 --> 00:37:41,457
Of course. You take after me.

615
00:37:45,044 --> 00:37:45,878
What?

616
00:37:46,754 --> 00:37:48,256
It's a gift for you.

617
00:37:48,339 --> 00:37:50,425
Wow, it's a huge diamond ring!

618
00:37:53,928 --> 00:37:55,596
The ring I never got from that bastard.

619
00:37:56,848 --> 00:37:58,975
But I get one from his son.

620
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,320
I want to come too.
I want to go with you, Mom.

621
00:38:10,403 --> 00:38:12,613
Hey! Why am I your mom?

622
00:38:12,697 --> 00:38:13,865
Don't call me that!

623
00:38:14,782 --> 00:38:15,616
Okay.

624
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,534
Don't follow me.

625
00:38:18,244 --> 00:38:20,997
Mom!

626
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:24,625
Mom.

627
00:39:31,526 --> 00:39:33,694
MISSING PERSONS
KANG GYEONG-HUI, NO MI-JA, SEO JI-SUK

628
00:39:42,078 --> 00:39:46,040
DAEHO-RI

629
00:39:46,124 --> 00:39:49,460
DAEHO MOTEL, PAST
DOGAVILL, PRESENT

630
00:40:07,103 --> 00:40:09,021
This is scaring me to death!

631
00:40:10,648 --> 00:40:13,151
Mom!

632
00:40:13,234 --> 00:40:14,444
You can't come in here!

633
00:40:15,027 --> 00:40:15,862
Mom!

634
00:40:15,945 --> 00:40:17,405
How could you let the kid in?

635
00:40:17,488 --> 00:40:18,990
Mom!

636
00:40:25,163 --> 00:40:26,747
You scared me!

637
00:40:27,415 --> 00:40:30,293
-What are you doing here so early?
-What's it look like? I'm working.

638
00:40:32,462 --> 00:40:34,839
You never come to work before 9:00 a.m.
What's the occasion?

639
00:40:35,465 --> 00:40:37,967
To be honest,
my mother-in-law came yesterday

640
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:40,219
with a suitcase that was as big as me.

641
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,805
So I started to wonder

642
00:40:42,889 --> 00:40:46,642
about how long I'd have to
come to work early and work overtime for.

643
00:40:46,726 --> 00:40:48,186
But don't get the wrong idea.

644
00:40:48,269 --> 00:40:50,521
My relationship's great
with my mother-in-law.

645
00:40:50,605 --> 00:40:54,275
I adequately fulfill
my duties as a son-in-law.

646
00:40:55,526 --> 00:40:56,360
Hello?

647
00:41:03,367 --> 00:41:04,202
Okay.

648
00:41:07,872 --> 00:41:09,040
Excuse me. Mr. Gye?

649
00:41:10,625 --> 00:41:11,626
Mr. Gye?

650
00:41:16,422 --> 00:41:17,256
Ji Dong-kwon…

651
00:41:18,674 --> 00:41:19,800
is dead.

652
00:41:27,058 --> 00:41:28,851
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

653
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,397
Goodness!

654
00:41:33,481 --> 00:41:35,900
You're a real office worker now.

655
00:41:35,983 --> 00:41:36,984
Ms. Na!

656
00:41:38,069 --> 00:41:39,445
How's working for the prosecutor?

657
00:41:39,946 --> 00:41:41,906
Work's the same wherever you go.

658
00:41:41,989 --> 00:41:44,784
You have papers in your hands,
and I have a mop in mine.

659
00:41:44,867 --> 00:41:46,953
I wouldn't say it's the same.

660
00:41:47,036 --> 00:41:51,374
I meant the mindset
about work was the same.

661
00:41:52,667 --> 00:41:55,086
Yeah, and that prosecutor, Gye Ji-ung?

662
00:41:55,169 --> 00:41:56,879
-How is he?
-Sorry?

663
00:41:56,963 --> 00:41:59,632
The word's spread.
They say he's difficult.

664
00:42:00,383 --> 00:42:03,594
Well, I don't know.
He's just skilled and works hard.

665
00:42:04,178 --> 00:42:05,263
He's good to me too.

666
00:42:05,346 --> 00:42:06,639
Please.

667
00:42:06,722 --> 00:42:08,474
They say he's a selfish workaholic.

668
00:42:09,267 --> 00:42:12,061
As long as he works hard, does it matter?

669
00:42:12,979 --> 00:42:16,440
All right. Let me know
if you have trouble with anything.

670
00:42:16,941 --> 00:42:19,652
I'll help you
if it's something I can help with.

671
00:42:19,735 --> 00:42:21,279
What are colleagues for?

672
00:42:21,362 --> 00:42:23,781
Love thy colleague, love thy country.

673
00:42:24,865 --> 00:42:25,992
You're so cool.

674
00:42:26,075 --> 00:42:29,161
Yeah, I'm in charge of your old job,

675
00:42:29,245 --> 00:42:30,788
so I bet I'm cool.

676
00:42:30,871 --> 00:42:32,873
No, it's just…

677
00:42:36,961 --> 00:42:38,462
Clean it up. Okay?

678
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,090
Inspector?

679
00:42:41,924 --> 00:42:42,842
Is this the cell?

680
00:42:42,925 --> 00:42:45,511
We were going to give you
the investigation records.

681
00:42:45,595 --> 00:42:48,097
But you actually came? What for, Mr. Gye?

682
00:42:50,016 --> 00:42:52,476
Because I have to see it for myself.
That's why.

683
00:42:58,274 --> 00:43:00,776
-What was his prison number?
-It was 5204.

684
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,570
Here's a list of his personal belongings.

685
00:43:06,115 --> 00:43:07,241
And the time of death?

686
00:43:07,325 --> 00:43:09,452
The medical director
will know the details.

687
00:43:09,535 --> 00:43:11,871
If it's before roll call,
it would be 9:00 a.m.

688
00:43:11,954 --> 00:43:14,373
Can we check
his call history after I left?

689
00:43:14,457 --> 00:43:16,000
We already had it printed out.

690
00:43:16,083 --> 00:43:17,168
Let's go.

691
00:43:20,713 --> 00:43:21,714
This way.

692
00:43:44,862 --> 00:43:46,822
CALL HISTORY

693
00:43:48,824 --> 00:43:50,493
A few numbers stand out.

694
00:43:51,577 --> 00:43:52,953
The number 5412 stands out.

695
00:43:53,537 --> 00:43:57,667
If you take a look,
he called this number often recently.

696
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:59,627
The number you have reached
is not in service.

697
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:00,544
It's disconnected.

698
00:44:01,253 --> 00:44:03,631
He wouldn't have called
a disconnected number.

699
00:44:03,714 --> 00:44:06,217
Clearly, it's a number
that can't be tracked.

700
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,302
They must've cut ties
knowing something happened.

701
00:44:09,929 --> 00:44:11,847
But how did they learn faster than us?

702
00:44:15,267 --> 00:44:18,396
By the way, he must've been
in serious pain before he died.

703
00:44:18,479 --> 00:44:21,107
If you look here,
there are signs of vomit.

704
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:24,944
Before he died, he said his stomach hurt
and went to the infirmary.

705
00:44:25,027 --> 00:44:26,612
It really was just indigestion.

706
00:44:28,114 --> 00:44:29,448
Where's the infirmary?

707
00:44:29,532 --> 00:44:30,616
MEDICAL RECORDS

708
00:44:40,084 --> 00:44:42,420
There will be an autopsy anyway.
Why the fuss?

709
00:44:42,503 --> 00:44:44,422
Medical records aren't in autopsies.

710
00:44:46,715 --> 00:44:47,550
Sure.

711
00:44:49,301 --> 00:44:51,178
We were told it was just indigestion.

712
00:44:51,262 --> 00:44:53,931
But judging by your records,
he was here for a while.

713
00:44:54,014 --> 00:44:55,641
You know this.

714
00:44:55,724 --> 00:45:00,438
An inmate will cut their finger
and act as if they're dying, you know?

715
00:45:01,021 --> 00:45:04,191
They'd break their own arms
and legs to get outside.

716
00:45:04,275 --> 00:45:06,110
It's a relief if they understand.

717
00:45:07,361 --> 00:45:10,322
Those who don't understand
must give you a hard time.

718
00:45:10,406 --> 00:45:11,407
Yeah.

719
00:45:13,742 --> 00:45:15,870
You won't find much even with the autopsy.

720
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:18,998
Drug addicts go into cardiac arrest
all the time.

721
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:22,543
Please move.

722
00:45:52,865 --> 00:45:53,991
He just came and left.

723
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:56,869
I'll prepare the shot.

724
00:45:58,037 --> 00:45:59,497
Hold him tight!

725
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:00,498
-Yes, sir!
-Hold tight!

726
00:46:00,581 --> 00:46:01,957
Hold him down now!

727
00:46:14,595 --> 00:46:16,263
Who cares if they're suspicious?

728
00:46:16,347 --> 00:46:18,224
A drug addict died after doing drugs.

729
00:46:29,401 --> 00:46:31,946
There was something off
with the medical director.

730
00:46:32,029 --> 00:46:34,698
Someone died,
but did you see how he reacted?

731
00:46:34,782 --> 00:46:36,534
It might not be a big deal for him.

732
00:46:36,617 --> 00:46:38,744
It's like how murder scenes don't faze us.

733
00:46:39,578 --> 00:46:41,789
The autopsy report
needs to come out quickly.

734
00:46:42,373 --> 00:46:45,209
Be careful so the victim
doesn't hear of this until then.

735
00:46:45,834 --> 00:46:46,710
Ko Won?

736
00:46:47,127 --> 00:46:49,255
Even if the perpetrator tried to harm him,

737
00:46:49,338 --> 00:46:52,174
suddenly learning of his death
could affect him mentally.

738
00:46:53,884 --> 00:46:56,595
Are you worried this might shock Ko Won?

739
00:46:57,179 --> 00:46:58,889
Media coverage won't help us.

740
00:47:00,182 --> 00:47:01,934
How surprisingly kind of you.

741
00:47:02,017 --> 00:47:04,770
If only you could be
half as good to people at work too.

742
00:47:05,187 --> 00:47:06,814
It's not like I'm bad to people.

743
00:47:06,897 --> 00:47:08,566
You aren't good to them either.

744
00:47:09,775 --> 00:47:10,693
I'll be on my way.

745
00:47:25,666 --> 00:47:28,669
The prosecutor will be here
in about ten minutes.

746
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:32,923
The deceased perpetrator's case
is a sensitive issue.

747
00:47:34,133 --> 00:47:35,509
Okay, thank you.

748
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:42,224
Coffee delivery.

749
00:47:44,476 --> 00:47:47,104
Did you know I was here alone?

750
00:47:47,187 --> 00:47:48,939
Yes, of course.

751
00:47:52,735 --> 00:47:53,777
Did someone die?

752
00:47:56,655 --> 00:47:57,489
Did you hear me?

753
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:01,160
Who died?

754
00:48:01,744 --> 00:48:03,037
You said it was a perpetrator.

755
00:48:03,621 --> 00:48:04,622
Who is it?

756
00:48:09,043 --> 00:48:11,045
He'll know anyway when he gets the call.

757
00:48:14,256 --> 00:48:17,301
The online troll who tried to hurt you.

758
00:48:22,514 --> 00:48:23,641
Are you okay?

759
00:48:23,724 --> 00:48:26,518
Ko Won? I shouldn't have told you.

760
00:48:29,938 --> 00:48:30,856
He died?

761
00:48:33,025 --> 00:48:34,234
My goodness.

762
00:48:36,612 --> 00:48:37,613
What do I do?

763
00:48:50,751 --> 00:48:51,627
We need to talk.

764
00:48:53,629 --> 00:48:54,630
Go in first.

765
00:48:54,713 --> 00:48:56,173
Okay, if you'll excuse me.

766
00:49:01,095 --> 00:49:03,055
I'm not sure what it's about,
but let's be brief.

767
00:49:04,848 --> 00:49:06,016
I heard he died.

768
00:49:11,855 --> 00:49:12,731
Was it suicide?

769
00:49:16,402 --> 00:49:17,236
Who told you?

770
00:49:20,864 --> 00:49:22,074
By any chance…

771
00:49:25,035 --> 00:49:26,286
did he die because of me?

772
00:49:30,374 --> 00:49:31,709
Did he die because of me?

773
00:49:47,808 --> 00:49:50,477
Who told the victim
about the suspect's death?

774
00:49:51,478 --> 00:49:53,313
It didn't leak from here, did it?

775
00:49:54,231 --> 00:49:58,777
He seemed so uneasy,
so I wanted to reassure him--

776
00:49:58,861 --> 00:50:00,320
Is your job

777
00:50:00,404 --> 00:50:02,948
to interpret and give meaning
to whatever you want?

778
00:50:03,031 --> 00:50:04,199
In any case,

779
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:08,078
he'd find out when they file
the paperwork to drop the charges.

780
00:50:08,162 --> 00:50:12,040
His legal representatives
could've received that paperwork.

781
00:50:12,124 --> 00:50:13,125
I know that, but--

782
00:50:13,208 --> 00:50:16,170
Is that all you know?
The investigation isn't over yet.

783
00:50:16,253 --> 00:50:19,882
Did you even consider how the suspect's
death would upset the victim?

784
00:50:23,135 --> 00:50:24,344
I'm sorry.

785
00:50:24,428 --> 00:50:26,597
What if the autopsy
reports it as a suicide?

786
00:50:27,055 --> 00:50:29,349
How can the victim handle that
while working here?

787
00:50:29,433 --> 00:50:30,392
How?

788
00:50:30,851 --> 00:50:32,978
Sir, I think she told him without knowing.

789
00:50:33,061 --> 00:50:34,521
-That's enough.
-I mean…

790
00:50:59,254 --> 00:51:00,798
Why would I be upset?

791
00:51:02,174 --> 00:51:03,717
He was totally right.

792
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:09,556
I'm not even a real office assistant.

793
00:51:11,099 --> 00:51:12,434
Or an investigator.

794
00:51:13,727 --> 00:51:14,645
I'm just…

795
00:51:16,146 --> 00:51:18,899
Lee Mi-jin, an insignificant job seeker.

796
00:51:20,526 --> 00:51:23,821
Nothing more, nothing less. Just that.

797
00:51:28,909 --> 00:51:30,869
This is why I don't like
working with people

798
00:51:30,953 --> 00:51:33,288
who are old, inexperienced, and chatty.

799
00:51:34,081 --> 00:51:35,958
But you wanted to delay her quitting.

800
00:51:36,041 --> 00:51:37,876
She's been working pretty hard.

801
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,795
What's the point? She's not helpful.

802
00:51:40,504 --> 00:51:42,172
I was the only one who was happy.

803
00:51:42,714 --> 00:51:45,133
Like a fool, I was so excited.

804
00:51:45,843 --> 00:51:47,302
I finally got to work.

805
00:51:47,386 --> 00:51:50,639
Organize these legal precedents
into documents before noon.

806
00:51:50,722 --> 00:51:53,141
Organize our accounting records in Excel.

807
00:51:53,225 --> 00:51:55,936
Attach the necessary quarterly statements
and the annual plan

808
00:51:56,019 --> 00:51:57,479
and save them to the shared folders.

809
00:51:57,563 --> 00:52:00,357
Give this to him in person.
Having him appear would be best.

810
00:52:02,067 --> 00:52:04,111
I didn't know anything

811
00:52:04,194 --> 00:52:06,238
and was so excited. Damn it.

812
00:52:07,072 --> 00:52:08,115
I'm such a moron.

813
00:52:13,078 --> 00:52:14,913
What do you want me to do?

814
00:52:15,831 --> 00:52:17,708
You should've made me totally old!

815
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:19,418
Like an elderly, hunched lady.

816
00:52:19,793 --> 00:52:22,170
Then, I wouldn't have tortured myself
with hope!

817
00:52:22,254 --> 00:52:25,132
What can I do looking like this?

818
00:52:25,841 --> 00:52:29,803
Why in the world
did you make me like this? Why?

819
00:52:34,725 --> 00:52:36,184
To be honest, I already knew.

820
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:40,355
Who asked you to do this?

821
00:52:41,607 --> 00:52:43,525
They keep legal precedents as records?

822
00:52:44,568 --> 00:52:45,402
That's a first.

823
00:52:48,155 --> 00:52:49,948
But why would you do this?

824
00:52:50,324 --> 00:52:53,035
We don't need to organize
accounting records like this.

825
00:52:54,912 --> 00:52:57,873
-Take them.
-I'm sure they asked since they needed it.

826
00:52:57,956 --> 00:52:58,999
-I see.
-Thank you.

827
00:52:59,082 --> 00:52:59,917
You're welcome.

828
00:53:01,168 --> 00:53:04,546
Why would you serve a summons in person?
You're not a postal worker.

829
00:53:08,467 --> 00:53:10,010
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

830
00:53:11,219 --> 00:53:13,138
I pretended like I didn't know.

831
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,517
I was barely hanging onto the job.

832
00:53:18,477 --> 00:53:20,312
I didn't want it to disappear.

833
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:05,190
The wind is blowing

834
00:54:06,566 --> 00:54:07,401
Damn it.

835
00:54:07,526 --> 00:54:10,612
Who the hell drank it all?

836
00:54:11,405 --> 00:54:13,490
I drank it all

837
00:54:14,199 --> 00:54:17,077
I drank all of it

838
00:54:24,584 --> 00:54:26,628
Why is time moving so fast?

839
00:54:33,635 --> 00:54:35,262
What if my mom and dad

840
00:54:36,346 --> 00:54:38,724
become really old?

841
00:54:44,938 --> 00:54:47,858
They can't get older than me.

842
00:54:53,989 --> 00:54:57,826
What if I grow old and never get married?

843
00:54:59,244 --> 00:55:00,996
That would…

844
00:55:02,956 --> 00:55:05,292
upset me so much.

845
00:55:17,429 --> 00:55:20,807
Two, three, four, six, seven, eight.

846
00:55:21,892 --> 00:55:23,477
What? Damn it.

847
00:55:26,772 --> 00:55:27,689
Damn it.

848
00:55:29,149 --> 00:55:30,692
Is this it?

849
00:55:30,776 --> 00:55:33,278
I know it's right. Ga-yeong!

850
00:55:33,361 --> 00:55:34,905
Why won't you open up?

851
00:55:38,909 --> 00:55:41,244
Ga-yeong! I'm here!

852
00:55:41,328 --> 00:55:42,829
I know you're home.

853
00:55:44,581 --> 00:55:45,665
Ga-yeong!

854
00:55:45,749 --> 00:55:46,958
Ga-yeong?

855
00:55:50,295 --> 00:55:51,922
Ga-yeong!

856
00:55:53,298 --> 00:55:55,634
Ga-yeong, why won't you open the door?

857
00:56:07,395 --> 00:56:09,022
I've got a way.

858
00:56:13,401 --> 00:56:15,195
Shit! My goodness!

859
00:56:17,114 --> 00:56:18,824
What's this? What's wrong with it?

860
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:20,867
What's going on?

861
00:56:23,411 --> 00:56:24,412
What in the world?

862
00:56:29,251 --> 00:56:30,085
What's going on?

863
00:56:40,262 --> 00:56:42,055
Who are you?

864
00:56:43,056 --> 00:56:44,015
Excuse me?

865
00:56:46,226 --> 00:56:47,519
-Ms. Lee Mi-jin?
-Yes?

866
00:56:48,186 --> 00:56:49,604
What? Are you sleeping here?

867
00:56:50,355 --> 00:56:51,398
Wake up.

868
00:56:51,982 --> 00:56:53,233
Please get up.

869
00:56:55,152 --> 00:56:56,361
What are you doing?

870
00:56:56,445 --> 00:56:58,071
This isn't the right house.

871
00:56:58,155 --> 00:56:59,656
Wait, Ms. Lee Mi-jin.

872
00:57:06,455 --> 00:57:08,540
Did you wreck the door?

873
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:16,840
-Ms. Lee Mi-jin!
-Yes?

874
00:57:26,308 --> 00:57:29,227
I told her it was dangerous,
but she goes and drinks alone.

875
00:57:31,438 --> 00:57:33,773
She really doesn't listen. What?

876
00:57:34,566 --> 00:57:35,775
Please wake up.

877
00:57:37,861 --> 00:57:42,115
My stomach feels terrible.
I think I might throw up.

878
00:57:43,116 --> 00:57:44,576
I'll see if I have medicine.

879
00:57:46,453 --> 00:57:49,289
Don't wear those glasses!

880
00:57:49,998 --> 00:57:53,168
-What?
-You look like such a jerk with them on.

881
00:57:54,711 --> 00:57:57,422
-What?
-Jeez, I said you look like a jerk.

882
00:57:57,506 --> 00:58:01,009
They turn you into a jerk,
so just throw them away!

883
00:58:04,012 --> 00:58:05,055
See?

884
00:58:05,138 --> 00:58:07,599
You look much better without glasses.

885
00:58:07,682 --> 00:58:09,017
Seriously?

886
00:58:11,353 --> 00:58:12,896
-Look here.
-What?

887
00:58:15,607 --> 00:58:16,900
Don't look down on me.

888
00:58:19,694 --> 00:58:20,570
Damn it.

889
00:58:21,655 --> 00:58:23,490
What is it? Well?

890
00:58:24,241 --> 00:58:25,784
You're selfish.

891
00:58:26,284 --> 00:58:28,328
You're mean too.

892
00:58:28,411 --> 00:58:29,913
You're so rude.

893
00:58:31,414 --> 00:58:34,918
But what a waste of a face.

894
00:58:35,001 --> 00:58:36,461
Let go of me.

895
00:59:28,096 --> 00:59:31,933
I'll trust you, so keep your promise.

896
01:00:22,901 --> 01:00:23,818
What in the world?

897
01:00:28,114 --> 01:00:29,783
You're up earlier than I thought.

898
01:00:31,451 --> 01:00:33,078
Drink this and get it together.

899
01:00:39,334 --> 01:00:41,336
What are you doing here, Mr. Gye?

900
01:00:42,003 --> 01:00:43,046
This is my place.

901
01:00:43,129 --> 01:00:44,130
Your place?

902
01:00:46,049 --> 01:00:46,883
But…

903
01:00:48,051 --> 01:00:50,011
I went to my friend's house

904
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:52,138
last night.

905
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:55,266
Where am I?

906
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:56,935
My place. My apartment.

907
01:00:57,018 --> 01:00:58,019
Your place?

908
01:00:58,812 --> 01:01:00,105
Dogavill, Apartment 403?

909
01:01:00,188 --> 01:01:01,314
I'm Apartment 303.

910
01:01:01,898 --> 01:01:02,732
Apartment 303?

911
01:01:09,239 --> 01:01:11,658
I'm so sorry. Last night…

912
01:01:11,741 --> 01:01:14,119
I drank too much
and thought this was my friend's place.

913
01:01:14,202 --> 01:01:15,537
I mistakenly came in. I'm sorry.

914
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:18,289
You were pretty drunk.
You reeked of alcohol as well.

915
01:01:19,249 --> 01:01:21,126
I'm sorry. I'll go now.

916
01:01:29,342 --> 01:01:30,552
What's going on?

917
01:01:31,302 --> 01:01:33,179
I forgot to tell you.

918
01:01:33,263 --> 01:01:36,182
Some drunk person destroyed
my door lock last night.

919
01:01:37,016 --> 01:01:38,017
Ga-yeong!

920
01:01:40,478 --> 01:01:42,188
Shit! My goodness me!

921
01:01:43,606 --> 01:01:47,318
I'm sorry. But you're not saying
we can't get out, are you?

922
01:01:47,402 --> 01:01:48,945
I had my doubts too at first.

923
01:01:49,028 --> 01:01:51,364
I don't know what you did,
but it doesn't work.

924
01:01:51,448 --> 01:01:53,783
-What do we do?
-We wait for the repairman.

925
01:01:53,867 --> 01:01:56,119
-When's he coming?
-When they open.

926
01:01:56,202 --> 01:01:57,954
-So 9:00 a.m. at the earliest--
-No!

927
01:02:03,126 --> 01:02:05,795
I mean, I have something
very urgent to do today.

928
01:02:05,879 --> 01:02:07,464
I have to go right now.

929
01:02:07,547 --> 01:02:09,215
Should we break the door down?

930
01:02:09,299 --> 01:02:11,301
-Can you do that?
-Seriously?

931
01:02:11,384 --> 01:02:13,261
Please open the door! Seriously!

932
01:02:13,344 --> 01:02:15,722
I have to go before the sun rises!

933
01:02:15,805 --> 01:02:16,931
How? It's broken.

934
01:02:17,015 --> 01:02:19,517
You broke it.
Why are you going in there?

935
01:02:19,601 --> 01:02:21,144
No!

936
01:02:23,897 --> 01:02:24,898
Where are you going?

937
01:02:29,694 --> 01:02:30,737
What's wrong?

938
01:02:32,363 --> 01:02:33,698
-What is she doing?
-I…

939
01:03:32,006 --> 01:03:34,926
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

940
01:03:36,177 --> 01:03:37,345
Did you get in a fight?

941
01:03:37,428 --> 01:03:38,888
It looks like they aimed for it.

942
01:03:38,972 --> 01:03:41,349
Just leave the money and go
while we're being nice.

943
01:03:44,769 --> 01:03:46,062
I said…

944
01:03:47,146 --> 01:03:48,481
I'll interpret it.

945
01:03:48,565 --> 01:03:49,858
A grand plan.

946
01:03:49,941 --> 01:03:52,861
We need your exceptional skills.

947
01:03:53,486 --> 01:03:55,029
Goodness.

948
01:03:55,738 --> 01:03:57,448
Do you have time to meet up?

949
01:03:57,532 --> 01:03:59,409
I didn't know
we'd get along this well either.

950
01:03:59,492 --> 01:04:01,119
Let's really do our best.

951
01:04:01,995 --> 01:04:03,496
For a long time, if possible.

952
01:04:06,374 --> 01:04:11,004
