00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,789
- What in the world?
- You're up earlier than I thought.

8
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:34,793
Drink this and get it together.

9
00:00:35,419 --> 00:00:37,421
What are you doing here, Mr. Gye?

10
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:38,463
This is my place.

11
00:00:38,547 --> 00:00:39,840
Your place?

12
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,343
But I went
to my friend's house last night.

13
00:00:43,427 --> 00:00:44,553
Dogavill, Apartment 403?

14
00:00:44,636 --> 00:00:45,637
I'm Apartment 303.

15
00:00:46,221 --> 00:00:47,055
Apartment 303?

16
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:52,477
I'm so sorry. Last night…

17
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:54,688
I drank too much
and thought this was my friend's place.

18
00:00:54,771 --> 00:00:56,106
I mistakenly came in. I'm sorry.

19
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:59,067
You were pretty drunk.
You reeked of alcohol as well.

20
00:00:59,151 --> 00:01:00,694
I'm sorry. I'll go now.

21
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:07,659
What's going on?

22
00:01:07,742 --> 00:01:08,952
What's wrong with this?

23
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:11,246
I forgot to tell you.

24
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:14,458
Some drunk person destroyed
my door lock last night.

25
00:01:15,417 --> 00:01:16,251
<i>Ga-yeong!</i>

26
00:01:17,252 --> 00:01:18,962
Ga-yeong!

27
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,255
Why won't you open up?

28
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,760
Shit! My goodness!

29
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:30,307
I'm sorry. But you're not saying
we can't get out, are you?

30
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,975
I had my doubts too at first.

31
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:34,394
I don't know what you did,
but it doesn't work.

32
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:36,980
- What do we do?
- We wait for the repairman.

33
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:39,149
- When's he coming?
- When they open.

34
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:41,109
- So 9:00 a.m. at the earliest--
- No!

35
00:01:46,198 --> 00:01:48,909
I mean, I have something
very urgent to do today.

36
00:01:48,992 --> 00:01:50,452
I have to go right now.

37
00:01:50,535 --> 00:01:52,204
Should we break the door down?

38
00:01:52,287 --> 00:01:54,372
- Can you do that?
- Seriously?

39
00:01:54,456 --> 00:01:56,374
Please open the door! Seriously!

40
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,752
I have to go before the sun rises!

41
00:01:58,835 --> 00:02:00,003
How? It's broken.

42
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:02,422
You broke it.
Why are you going in there?

43
00:02:02,506 --> 00:02:03,882
No!

44
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:06,593
What?

45
00:02:11,556 --> 00:02:12,557
What's wrong?

46
00:02:14,184 --> 00:02:15,894
- What is she doing?
- I…

47
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:25,737
What are you doing?

48
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,366
Hey, are you insane?

49
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,617
Sir! I'm going to fall!

50
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,868
- Let go!
- Come down!

51
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:34,287
- I'm going to fall!
- It's dangerous! Come down!

52
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:35,705
- Come down, okay?
- Let go.

53
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,040
This is more dangerous.

54
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:38,500
Mr. Gye!

55
00:02:39,084 --> 00:02:40,126
Hello, 911?

56
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,628
This is Dogavill, Apartment 303.

57
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:42,712
I'm sorry!

58
00:02:44,756 --> 00:02:46,174
Gosh, I'm so sorry!

59
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,552
I'm sorry. Just a moment.

60
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:51,846
Wait! Someone's in danger,
so can you come right now?

61
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,099
Don't call 911. Okay, I made it.

62
00:02:54,182 --> 00:02:56,226
I'm here! Here I go!

63
00:02:58,228 --> 00:02:59,187
Never mind.

64
00:03:01,064 --> 00:03:02,065
Ms. Lee Mi-jin.

65
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:03,984
Excuse me?

66
00:03:06,444 --> 00:03:08,029
Ga-yeong!

67
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,410
Open the door.

68
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,829
The door!

69
00:03:15,912 --> 00:03:18,248
What's going on?

70
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:21,418
It's so early in the morning!
What is she doing?

71
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,169
What in the world?

72
00:03:26,965 --> 00:03:28,091
Open the door.

73
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,885
What are you doing?

74
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:36,182
What are you doing? Why are you here?

75
00:03:36,892 --> 00:03:38,268
Close the door! Close it!

76
00:03:42,147 --> 00:03:44,566
How did you get up there?

77
00:03:44,649 --> 00:03:45,692
I almost died.

78
00:03:47,736 --> 00:03:49,070
What's with you?

79
00:03:49,154 --> 00:03:50,739
What's wrong with you?

80
00:03:51,406 --> 00:03:52,282
Hey…

81
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:05,086
Goodness, Ga-yeong.

82
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,546
Give me some water.

83
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:12,969
Damn.

84
00:04:13,845 --> 00:04:14,846
Damn it.

85
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,978
You've gone
and lost your mind, haven't you?

86
00:04:23,188 --> 00:04:26,358
So you went to the wrong place
because you were drunk?

87
00:04:26,983 --> 00:04:30,153
But that happened to be
the prosecutor's place?

88
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:33,782
Are you insane?

89
00:04:33,865 --> 00:04:34,741
Gosh.

90
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:36,785
I know. Of all places…

91
00:04:38,286 --> 00:04:40,372
Doesn't he know the place is haunted?

92
00:04:40,455 --> 00:04:42,374
Are you worrying about him right now?

93
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,125
I don't know.

94
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:45,794
I don't want to think about it.

95
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:48,505
As of now, I have amnesia.

96
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,590
Wait.

97
00:04:51,132 --> 00:04:52,676
If you got drunk,

98
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,595
you should've just gone to bed,
but why come to my place?

99
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,805
Hey, friend.

100
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:59,808
I came here because I drank alcohol.

101
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:03,186
If my parents saw me
like this while drunk…

102
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:04,980
Where did you drink all this alcohol?

103
00:05:05,063 --> 00:05:06,481
At home alone.

104
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:08,525
Did something happen?

105
00:05:10,026 --> 00:05:11,069
Something happened.

106
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,321
What am I going to do?

107
00:05:13,405 --> 00:05:14,489
Well, what can we do?

108
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,450
For now…

109
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:19,411
Hide it from your parents and--

110
00:05:19,494 --> 00:05:20,870
It's not that.

111
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:23,540
It's the prosecutor.

112
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,667
What do I do if he thinks I'm weird?

113
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:29,129
Damn it, what do I tell him?

114
00:05:29,671 --> 00:05:32,173
What if he asks me
why I climbed out the window?

115
00:05:33,883 --> 00:05:35,802
Should I say it's an occasional hobby?

116
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,680
He wouldn't believe me.

117
00:05:38,763 --> 00:05:40,890
What do I do? Damn it!

118
00:05:43,393 --> 00:05:45,103
What is it? Hey.

119
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:49,190
Don't look at me like that.

120
00:05:49,274 --> 00:05:50,316
Stop it.

121
00:05:53,278 --> 00:05:54,988
- Come on.
- Right?

122
00:05:55,697 --> 00:05:58,450
They say even flowers
can bloom in the desert.

123
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:00,452
What are you talking about?

124
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:02,912
Stop it. Don't.

125
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:04,914
You brat.

126
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,208
What is it?

127
00:06:07,292 --> 00:06:08,209
I got the sign.

128
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:11,045
It's time to poop.

129
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:12,881
Wait. My phone.

130
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,261
Did you eat kimchi <i>ramyeon?</i>

131
00:06:20,972 --> 00:06:23,558
You're always watching TV shows
when you poop.

132
00:06:23,641 --> 00:06:25,226
That's why you're constipated.

133
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,311
Damn.

134
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:31,858
He wouldn't come up here.

135
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:33,902
Should I eat some <i>ramyeon </i>first?

136
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,824
Ga-yeong, someone's here.

137
00:06:45,163 --> 00:06:46,664
Hey!

138
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,834
- Open the door.
- Why?

139
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:51,252
He's here.

140
00:06:51,336 --> 00:06:52,837
He came from downstairs!

141
00:06:52,921 --> 00:06:54,047
Come on out!

142
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,800
Hey, I can't stop right now.
Why don't you just go?

143
00:06:57,675 --> 00:06:59,427
Gosh, what do I do?

144
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:01,221
Should I call and tell him to go?

145
00:07:01,304 --> 00:07:04,557
- What do I do?
- Just cover you face and get out there!

146
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,143
Wait a second. Did he leave?

147
00:07:15,276 --> 00:07:16,194
Excuse me.

148
00:07:17,278 --> 00:07:18,655
I'm busy, so just leave.

149
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:21,950
<i>Ms. Lee Mi-jin?</i>

150
00:07:24,494 --> 00:07:25,954
<i>You left your belongings.</i>

151
00:07:27,956 --> 00:07:29,207
Just leave it there.

152
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,167
<i>Okay.</i>

153
00:08:01,739 --> 00:08:03,616
- Ms. Lim!
- No way!

154
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,410
What are you doing here?

155
00:08:05,994 --> 00:08:07,871
Why would I be here?

156
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:11,374
- What?
- Nothing. Do you live here?

157
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:15,295
She's my aunt.

158
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:16,880
My niece.

159
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,883
I live in Apartment 403.
I'm Do Ga-yeong, Mi-jin's friend.

160
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,050
Hello.

161
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:23,553
Then, where's Lee Mi-jin?

162
00:08:25,054 --> 00:08:26,931
- She's taking a dump.
- Taking a what?

163
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:29,392
She's pooping.

164
00:08:30,393 --> 00:08:32,270
Do you want me to get her? Mi-jin!

165
00:08:32,353 --> 00:08:34,647
- Mi-jin!
- Someone's here for you.

166
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:36,274
Are you going to take long?

167
00:08:36,357 --> 00:08:37,567
Come on out here.

168
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,320
- She must be constipated.
- That's right.

169
00:08:40,403 --> 00:08:41,654
I think it'll be a while.

170
00:08:41,738 --> 00:08:44,699
Should we tell her to call you
when she's done?

171
00:08:45,283 --> 00:08:46,951
No, it's fine. There's no need.

172
00:08:47,035 --> 00:08:48,161
Have a nice day.

173
00:08:48,786 --> 00:08:50,121
Wait, is that…

174
00:08:50,205 --> 00:08:51,414
What is that?

175
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:52,999
She said her stomach hurt.

176
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,043
Could you give this to her?

177
00:08:56,711 --> 00:08:59,422
Okay, I'll make sure she gets it.

178
00:08:59,964 --> 00:09:00,798
Have a good day.

179
00:09:00,882 --> 00:09:03,009
- She told me you were kind.
- That's enough.

180
00:09:03,092 --> 00:09:04,052
Excuse me?

181
00:09:04,135 --> 00:09:05,887
Mi-jin often spoke of Mr. Gye--

182
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,348
I mean, she said so much about you--

183
00:09:09,557 --> 00:09:11,434
- What?
- For crying out loud!

184
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,811
A fly went into your mouth.

185
00:09:17,815 --> 00:09:19,234
This girl…

186
00:09:19,317 --> 00:09:21,402
She's so funny.

187
00:09:22,445 --> 00:09:23,529
Take care.

188
00:09:24,113 --> 00:09:25,031
Goodbye.

189
00:09:33,915 --> 00:09:35,500
Stop laughing.

190
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:37,919
You don't like him?

191
00:09:38,002 --> 00:09:39,462
Even though you're acting like this?

192
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:40,964
Seriously, I don't…

193
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:42,048
It's not true.

194
00:09:42,131 --> 00:09:42,966
Holy cow!

195
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:47,845
Sure, I could have good feelings
about him because he helped me.

196
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:50,306
But don't you know me?

197
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,308
I'm really good at knowing my place.

198
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:53,893
What are you talking about?

199
00:09:53,977 --> 00:09:55,687
What's so bad about you?

200
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:59,023
Jeez, I already had a
gloomy life that wasn't special,

201
00:09:59,107 --> 00:10:00,441
and then I suddenly became old.

202
00:10:00,525 --> 00:10:02,360
You actually think I seem normal?

203
00:10:03,152 --> 00:10:04,028
Hey.

204
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:08,074
Why put yourself down like that?
I just said it for fun.

205
00:10:08,157 --> 00:10:09,075
Stop it.

206
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:12,203
It's only fun when you know
you have a chance.

207
00:10:12,287 --> 00:10:13,746
Seriously,

208
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,748
it's not like I have talents like you.

209
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,210
I'm not good at anything.
So why cause harm to others?

210
00:10:19,294 --> 00:10:21,004
I hate that more than anything.

211
00:10:21,963 --> 00:10:24,590
Why are you being so serious?

212
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,801
Hey.

213
00:10:26,884 --> 00:10:27,802
Stop it.

214
00:10:27,885 --> 00:10:29,929
Where did you get that hat?

215
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,515
- Your room.
- You came out like this?

216
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:33,433
Yeah.

217
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:37,145
Look at your fashion sense.
You're a catch.

218
00:10:37,228 --> 00:10:39,647
There weren't any clothes
in your laundry basket.

219
00:10:39,731 --> 00:10:42,066
Is your name Sancho? From Mexico?

220
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,534
Did she say she knew her?

221
00:10:54,162 --> 00:10:57,081
Is that all you know?
The investigation isn't over yet.

222
00:10:57,165 --> 00:11:00,877
Did you even consider how the suspect's
death would upset the victim?

223
00:11:02,587 --> 00:11:03,755
I'm sorry.

224
00:11:14,098 --> 00:11:16,267
Why did Mom call me so much?

225
00:11:17,685 --> 00:11:19,854
CALL HISTORY
PROSECUTOR GYE JI-UNG

226
00:11:19,937 --> 00:11:21,022
What?

227
00:11:21,105 --> 00:11:22,565
- Why did I do that?
- What?

228
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,233
What did you do this time?

229
00:11:24,859 --> 00:11:27,320
I drunk-dialed him.

230
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:28,988
Why did I call him?

231
00:11:29,572 --> 00:11:31,240
From which number? You have two.

232
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:33,117
- Mine.
- Yeah, which one?

233
00:11:33,201 --> 00:11:35,244
I mean, Lee Mi-jin's number.

234
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:37,997
Did you talk about Lim Sun as Lee Mi-jin?

235
00:11:38,081 --> 00:11:39,373
I don't remember.

236
00:11:39,874 --> 00:11:40,833
Give me your phone.

237
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,590
Hey, you talked for 30 minutes
and you don't remember?

238
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:48,674
I don't remember.

239
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:51,636
Do you remember how you got here?

240
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:53,137
I said I don't remember.

241
00:11:53,221 --> 00:11:55,098
You crazy bitch. Go and die.

242
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,725
I must be insane!

243
00:11:57,809 --> 00:11:59,102
- Should I just die?
- Hey.

244
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,395
Don't do that to your hair.
You'll go bald!

245
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:02,647
There's already a spot.

246
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,108
Is blacking out a symptom of dementia?

247
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,610
You always black out
when you drink too much.

248
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:10,238
Also, it's better
if you don't remember this.

249
00:12:10,321 --> 00:12:12,740
If you were obnoxious,
how would you face him at work?

250
00:12:14,075 --> 00:12:15,076
Seriously!

251
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:19,956
It's hot.

252
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,415
Are you in menopause?

253
00:12:21,499 --> 00:12:22,708
What?

254
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:24,001
You're all over the place.

255
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:26,045
Seriously, I feel so…

256
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:27,463
What am I going to do?

257
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,174
Okay, this won't do.

258
00:12:30,258 --> 00:12:31,342
- Mi-jin?
- Yeah?

259
00:12:31,425 --> 00:12:34,137
I'll make you feel better.

260
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,221
How?

261
00:12:36,097 --> 00:12:38,558
Clear your schedule this weekend.

262
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,726
Should I drink another one?

263
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,061
Go ahead.

264
00:12:42,854 --> 00:12:44,814
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

265
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,692
FOR ALL REQUESTS, PLEASE TAKE A NUMBER
AND WAIT FOR YOUR TURN

266
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,992
But he died.

267
00:12:57,535 --> 00:12:58,953
He's dead.

268
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,039
Who's in charge?

269
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:06,586
Come out or else!

270
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,338
If you don't, you're all dead!

271
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:10,882
Sir, please calm down.

272
00:13:10,965 --> 00:13:12,550
Please tell us what you're--

273
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:14,802
Just because I didn't pay
some measly fines,

274
00:13:14,886 --> 00:13:16,679
you freeze my bank account?

275
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,514
Are you insane? Seriously?

276
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:19,432
Sir.

277
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:21,309
I can help you with that.

278
00:13:21,392 --> 00:13:22,727
How are you going to help?

279
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,061
You must calm down first.

280
00:13:24,145 --> 00:13:26,439
- What?
- Over here, please.

281
00:13:27,231 --> 00:13:28,900
What are you doing? Let go!

282
00:13:28,983 --> 00:13:31,110
- Calm down.
- Let go of me!

283
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,664
Damn it.

284
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:03,100
Where's my medication?

285
00:14:03,184 --> 00:14:04,268
<i>Medication?</i>

286
00:14:04,352 --> 00:14:05,228
<i>For your anxiety?</i>

287
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,896
<i>You told me to get rid of them.</i>

288
00:14:07,438 --> 00:14:08,898
Damn it.

289
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:47,228
Ms. Lim?

290
00:14:48,729 --> 00:14:49,730
Hello.

291
00:14:51,274 --> 00:14:55,444
You said before that I could ask you
if I was curious about something.

292
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,989
Of course. What is it?

293
00:14:59,323 --> 00:15:03,077
It's about the person
who held this position before I did.

294
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,122
You can speak informally.
I'm the youngest here.

295
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:09,667
- With more comfort comes more respect.
- I see.

296
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:13,421
But what about Ko Na-heun?

297
00:15:14,463 --> 00:15:16,299
I was wondering why he quit.

298
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,260
He was absent without notice,

299
00:15:19,343 --> 00:15:21,762
so in line with our contracts,
he was let go.

300
00:15:23,472 --> 00:15:28,185
I felt bad because I thought
I'd stolen this job from someone in need.

301
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:29,645
- I see.
- By any chance…

302
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:32,064
Something didn't happen, did it?

303
00:15:32,648 --> 00:15:33,649
What do you mean?

304
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:43,534
Never mind.

305
00:15:43,618 --> 00:15:45,161
Okay.

306
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,246
- Let's get back to work.
- Okay.

307
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:50,958
AUTOPSY REPORT

308
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:57,465
PRESUMED TO BE ASIAN MALE IN HIS SIXTIES

309
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,968
- A man?
- I know.

310
00:16:01,052 --> 00:16:02,470
I was really surprised too.

311
00:16:02,553 --> 00:16:05,473
I thought it was a woman
from the size of the footprint.

312
00:16:06,057 --> 00:16:07,975
Did you see the victim's presumed age?

313
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:18,235
What type of SUV tires
do you normally put on?

314
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:20,655
We have all sorts of brands.

315
00:16:20,738 --> 00:16:21,906
We have all of them.

316
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:25,493
Yes, Ms. Tak?

317
00:16:25,576 --> 00:16:28,412
"Cause of death unknown."
"Unable to identify murder weapon."

318
00:16:28,496 --> 00:16:29,997
Why wasn't anything found?

319
00:16:30,081 --> 00:16:31,624
<i>Well, I think</i>

320
00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:34,627
conducting an autopsy
with a single body part has limits.

321
00:16:35,753 --> 00:16:38,673
- How's the investigation?
<i>- Well, we haven't found anything yet.</i>

322
00:16:38,756 --> 00:16:41,509
We're investigating
with the tire track results.

323
00:16:41,592 --> 00:16:43,469
We'll be able to identify
the suspect soon.

324
00:16:43,552 --> 00:16:47,056
<i>Fentanyl found in the blood test
wasn't a lethal dose.</i>

325
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:50,810
<i>It's just as Mr. Gye had said.
We're going through the medical records.</i>

326
00:16:50,893 --> 00:16:52,395
Why would Mr. Gye know that?

327
00:16:53,521 --> 00:16:55,272
Wait, how does he know that?

328
00:16:55,356 --> 00:16:56,524
He asked for it.

329
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,359
He saw the autopsy report too?

330
00:16:58,442 --> 00:16:59,944
<i>Just the blood test results.</i>

331
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:02,571
Detective Kwon.

332
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:06,158
From now on, don't tell anyone else
who's not involved with the case.

333
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:09,370
Damn it.

334
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:12,540
What's with her?

335
00:17:15,626 --> 00:17:17,086
- Sir.
- Yes?

336
00:17:18,045 --> 00:17:19,964
It's about plate number 60B38.

337
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:23,509
If you look at the forensic report,
the back tires were different.

338
00:17:23,592 --> 00:17:25,386
They put on different ones from the front.

339
00:17:25,469 --> 00:17:27,513
These are Noble Tires.

340
00:17:27,596 --> 00:17:30,474
Mid-sized SUVs
are usually fitted this way.

341
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:31,892
Is that so?

342
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:35,312
That narrows it down.

343
00:17:36,564 --> 00:17:37,565
Thank you, sir.

344
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:45,072
- Is that jerk here?
- Why would a jerk be here?

345
00:17:45,156 --> 00:17:46,031
Damn it.

346
00:17:46,115 --> 00:17:48,951
Come on. You're friends,
but you shouldn't call him that.

347
00:17:49,577 --> 00:17:51,162
Then, what should I call him?

348
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:53,372
Whether by experience or rank,

349
00:17:53,456 --> 00:17:56,125
he's your superior,
so even if you can't be formal,

350
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,918
at least show basic common courtesy.

351
00:17:58,502 --> 00:18:00,129
You're saying I lack the basics?

352
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:04,425
I didn't mean to hit a nerve,
but that seemed to have hurt.

353
00:18:09,138 --> 00:18:11,182
Lady, is that funny to you?

354
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,940
What is that cactus?

355
00:18:20,024 --> 00:18:21,609
Did Gye give that to you?

356
00:18:22,485 --> 00:18:23,986
Address her properly.

357
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,780
It's not "lady" but Ms. Lim.

358
00:18:26,947 --> 00:18:28,282
What fight are you picking now?

359
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,913
What about it? I gave it to her.

360
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:36,540
Damn it.

361
00:18:44,381 --> 00:18:45,257
Have a nice day.

362
00:18:48,177 --> 00:18:51,347
Some things never change.
He still looks down on people!

363
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:54,266
That lady's ridiculous too.

364
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,393
He gives you a gift and you take it?

365
00:18:56,477 --> 00:18:57,394
Damn it.

366
00:18:58,354 --> 00:19:01,148
They all suck!

367
00:19:13,869 --> 00:19:14,870
I'm sorry.

368
00:19:15,371 --> 00:19:17,248
You got in trouble because of me.

369
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,874
For what?

370
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,794
I felt bad about throwing out
a living plant,

371
00:19:21,877 --> 00:19:23,587
so I planted it in there.

372
00:19:24,171 --> 00:19:27,800
You did well.
It would've died in a week at my desk.

373
00:19:27,883 --> 00:19:29,134
You've got a green thumb.

374
00:19:30,553 --> 00:19:31,428
It's bloomed too.

375
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,271
This is Danmuji.

376
00:19:40,354 --> 00:19:41,856
You even named it.

377
00:19:42,773 --> 00:19:44,525
I grew attached while growing it.

378
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:48,696
Why are you putting it here?

379
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:50,114
You should try tending to it.

380
00:19:50,197 --> 00:19:51,740
No, that's okay.

381
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:54,910
It was your cactus to start with.

382
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:57,621
It's all settled now.
Just manage the humidity.

383
00:19:58,289 --> 00:19:59,415
And it'll endure.

384
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,083
Still, I don't think I can.

385
00:20:01,584 --> 00:20:02,918
Really, it's okay…

386
00:20:10,384 --> 00:20:13,262


387
00:20:23,063 --> 00:20:25,107
Sir, the documents you asked for…

388
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:28,444
What's with your face?

389
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,906
Did you get in a fight? Did you get hit?

390
00:20:33,616 --> 00:20:35,117
Hello, 911?

391
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,702
This is Dogavill, Apartment 303.

392
00:20:36,785 --> 00:20:37,870
I'm sorry!

393
00:20:39,455 --> 00:20:40,706
Gosh, I'm so sorry!

394
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:42,833
Yeah, I got hit pretty hard.

395
00:20:42,917 --> 00:20:43,876
Goodness.

396
00:20:44,627 --> 00:20:46,587
Why are you going around getting hit?

397
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:47,880
Apply this often.

398
00:20:49,298 --> 00:20:51,008
It looks like they aimed for it.

399
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,013
They definitely got me.

400
00:20:56,096 --> 00:20:57,306
I was cursed out too.

401
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,142
You must've met a powerful trash talker.

402
00:21:04,521 --> 00:21:07,274
I've been cursed out before,
and it's never bothered me.

403
00:21:08,192 --> 00:21:11,320
But what I heard really shook me.

404
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:14,782
Don't wear those glasses!

405
00:21:14,865 --> 00:21:18,285
- What?
- You look like such a jerk with them on.

406
00:21:19,995 --> 00:21:21,914
<i>I need to stop drinking so much.</i>

407
00:21:22,831 --> 00:21:24,166
<i>Seriously!</i>

408
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:28,212
<i>Still, after I really ripped into him,</i>

409
00:21:28,295 --> 00:21:29,755
<i>it must've been effective.</i>

410
00:21:30,965 --> 00:21:32,508
<i>Whatever.</i>

411
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:33,801
<i>Let's just quit.</i>

412
00:21:35,636 --> 00:21:39,098
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

413
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:47,272
<i>Someone saw the flyer and called.</i>

414
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,359
<i>Who? Did they see the cat?</i>

415
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:53,153
<i>Holy cow. They have the cat!</i>

416
00:21:53,237 --> 00:21:55,614
<i>Tell them you want to meet right now!</i>

417
00:21:55,698 --> 00:21:56,782
<i>I'll go.</i>

418
00:21:56,865 --> 00:21:58,450
<i>But you're working. Is it okay?</i>

419
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,205
<i>That's not important now.
I'm almost done. I'll go straight there.</i>

420
00:22:03,706 --> 00:22:05,541
<i>Okay, I'll give you the number.</i>

421
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,960
<i>Okay, thanks.</i>

422
00:22:12,005 --> 00:22:14,383
- Excuse me. I'm sorry, but--
- Yes?

423
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:22,099
It's been a while.
Should we all leave on time today?

424
00:22:22,182 --> 00:22:23,726
My mother-in-law's at home.

425
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:27,521
I'm working overtime this week.
Let's get some stew for dinner together.

426
00:22:27,604 --> 00:22:28,647
I'll pass on dinner.

427
00:22:29,523 --> 00:22:30,524
- Can we talk--
- Goodbye.

428
00:22:30,607 --> 00:22:33,694
Wait. Can we talk for a moment? Can…

429
00:22:33,777 --> 00:22:35,863
How about some pork stew?

430
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:39,283
Enough with the stews.
You gave me strange meds too.

431
00:22:50,461 --> 00:22:51,712
No!

432
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,381
Damn it.

433
00:22:55,382 --> 00:22:56,383
What?

434
00:23:11,315 --> 00:23:13,400
This umbrella…

435
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,404
Someone left this on my desk.

436
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,990
Since it was my desk, I guess it's mine.

437
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:25,287
Was there something
you wanted to talk about?

438
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,374
Well, the thing is

439
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:33,128
people can unintentionally
say things by mistake.

440
00:23:34,171 --> 00:23:36,381
<i>Is this because I drunk-dialed him?</i>

441
00:23:36,465 --> 00:23:37,716
What was said in anger--

442
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,134
Wait!

443
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:41,470
Anyone can say something by mistake.

444
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:44,515
No one's perfect, right?

445
00:23:44,598 --> 00:23:46,183
To persistently harp on someone

446
00:23:46,266 --> 00:23:48,560
for one little slip of the tongue
is so harsh.

447
00:23:48,644 --> 00:23:51,814
As an intellectual, shouldn't you be
generous and understanding

448
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:54,358
of mistakes made by those
who are less competent?

449
00:23:55,818 --> 00:23:57,569
I didn't think you were like this,

450
00:23:58,487 --> 00:23:59,738
but you're really…

451
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:02,282
You have an admirable attitude.

452
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:05,285
You're so accepting
of everything you hear.

453
00:24:05,369 --> 00:24:07,621
You're generous,
and you don't hold grudges.

454
00:24:08,372 --> 00:24:09,998
You really are an intellectual.

455
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:11,667
My goodness.

456
00:24:12,543 --> 00:24:16,004
I didn't know you were so understanding.

457
00:24:16,713 --> 00:24:19,550
I didn't know
we'd get along this well either.

458
00:24:20,384 --> 00:24:22,719
To tell you the truth,

459
00:24:22,803 --> 00:24:25,681
I wasn't sincere back then
when I said I hoped we'd get along.

460
00:24:26,348 --> 00:24:27,391
<i>Wait, what?</i>

461
00:24:27,474 --> 00:24:30,477
<i>Is he buttering me up before firing me?</i>

462
00:24:30,561 --> 00:24:31,520
But I take it back.

463
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,439
Let's really do our best.

464
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:36,859
For a long time, if possible.

465
00:25:15,689 --> 00:25:18,150
You didn't have to give me a ride.

466
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:31,204
I'll get out here.

467
00:25:32,372 --> 00:25:34,458
It's raining. I'll drive you home.

468
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:36,418
No! I'm getting out here right now!

469
00:25:38,921 --> 00:25:39,922
Okay.

470
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,801
Thank you.

471
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,470
You should take the umbrella.

472
00:25:46,553 --> 00:25:48,430
No, it's fine! Thank you!

473
00:26:08,575 --> 00:26:10,744
Damn it. The vibes were so good though.

474
00:26:10,827 --> 00:26:13,288
Damn it. If it weren't for my old face…

475
00:26:20,837 --> 00:26:22,673
Why did they want to meet here?

476
00:26:22,756 --> 00:26:23,840
Is this right?

477
00:26:24,675 --> 00:26:25,592
It's the right place.

478
00:26:26,093 --> 00:26:27,719
Hello.

479
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:30,555
- Hello.
- Hello.

480
00:26:30,639 --> 00:26:33,308
Did you call about having a cat?

481
00:26:33,392 --> 00:26:35,435
- Yes. Right here.
- Great.

482
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:36,853
Thank you.

483
00:26:39,982 --> 00:26:44,987
But I don't think
this is the cat I'm looking for.

484
00:26:47,948 --> 00:26:50,033
You punk. Are you sure you saw her?

485
00:26:50,492 --> 00:26:51,326
Did you?

486
00:26:51,785 --> 00:26:54,496
You said she was a famous content creator,
but she's a hag.

487
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:57,541
I saw her put the flyers up myself.

488
00:26:57,624 --> 00:27:00,127
You can't do anything right.
You want a beatdown?

489
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,086
- Hey.
- But…

490
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:02,838
What will you do if we're not paid?

491
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:05,716
I think this wound looks new.

492
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:09,720
Did you do this?

493
00:27:10,846 --> 00:27:12,305
This is unbelievable.

494
00:27:12,389 --> 00:27:14,599
Are you playing tricks
to get out of paying?

495
00:27:18,478 --> 00:27:19,938
What is wrong with you?

496
00:27:20,981 --> 00:27:24,276
Just leave the money and go
while we're being nice.

497
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,736
Okay? Hey!

498
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:27,446
You didn't get the money yet?

499
00:27:28,155 --> 00:27:30,115
You can't get through to her. Hurry up.

500
00:27:31,533 --> 00:27:33,535
What? What's the problem?

501
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:36,413
If you're old,

502
00:27:37,247 --> 00:27:38,248
you should act your age.

503
00:27:38,331 --> 00:27:40,042
How dare you try to rob a bunch of kids?

504
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:43,712
Hey, just shut up.
Leave the money and go.

505
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:46,882
That's not the cat I'm looking for.

506
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,967
Hurry and give us the money!

507
00:27:49,051 --> 00:27:50,510
- You talk too much!
- Stop!

508
00:27:52,596 --> 00:27:53,805
Who is that?

509
00:27:54,556 --> 00:27:55,390
Mr. Gye.

510
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:58,060
Step back. Move.

511
00:27:59,102 --> 00:27:59,978
What's going on?

512
00:28:00,062 --> 00:28:01,271
We agreed to meet here.

513
00:28:02,522 --> 00:28:05,275
You even brought your boyfriend.

514
00:28:05,358 --> 00:28:06,318
Incredible.

515
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,404
Is it okay to steal someone's cat or not?

516
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:12,074
What the hell are you saying?
No one stole it.

517
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:13,742
I don't think you get it.

518
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:17,120
If you simply stole it, that's theft.

519
00:28:17,204 --> 00:28:19,414
A lost cat makes it theft by finding.

520
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:22,584
If you didn't feed
the stolen cat and hit it,

521
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,711
that adds property damage
and animal abuse.

522
00:28:25,212 --> 00:28:27,547
The cops will decide
which one to charge you with.

523
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,093
I'd like to report a crime.

524
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:32,135
Wait a second!

525
00:28:32,219 --> 00:28:33,345
No, wait!

526
00:28:33,428 --> 00:28:34,429
Hey!

527
00:28:35,472 --> 00:28:36,640
This is…

528
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:39,559
I'm in front of Manjeon Internet Café.

529
00:28:43,313 --> 00:28:44,523
You son of a…

530
00:28:46,274 --> 00:28:47,109
You little…

531
00:28:51,154 --> 00:28:52,447
Wait!

532
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:54,366
You don't need to come.

533
00:28:54,449 --> 00:28:55,659
Let's get out of here!

534
00:28:56,243 --> 00:28:57,536
Yes, it's fine.

535
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:11,675
I think we should have
a proper conversation.

536
00:29:12,592 --> 00:29:13,718
Hey, let's get out of here.

537
00:29:14,678 --> 00:29:15,971
That hurt, didn't it?

538
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,014
Those damn jerks.

539
00:29:18,098 --> 00:29:19,808
Go back in. I'll tuck you inside.

540
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,685
Let's go back in. There you go.

541
00:29:24,771 --> 00:29:25,897
Did you lose your cat?

542
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,607
Yes.

543
00:29:27,691 --> 00:29:29,693
But what brought you here?

544
00:29:30,193 --> 00:29:31,736
I was looking for someone.

545
00:29:35,031 --> 00:29:37,451
I feel like I always meet you
in the strangest ways.

546
00:29:39,202 --> 00:29:40,662
Are you sober today?

547
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:41,746
Yes.

548
00:29:43,957 --> 00:29:46,793
I wasn't able to
properly say goodbye last time.

549
00:29:47,711 --> 00:29:48,879
I'm sorry.

550
00:29:48,962 --> 00:29:51,840
You should apologize
to yourself and not me.

551
00:29:52,841 --> 00:29:56,136
If something were to happen,
you'd be the one who gets hurt.

552
00:29:58,221 --> 00:29:59,598
Do you have to say it like that?

553
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:02,142
What? Did I sound like a jerk again?

554
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:04,895
No.

555
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:08,315
Is it okay to send
those kids away like that?

556
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:10,525
It's fine. I identified all of them.

557
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:12,652
Still, you never know.

558
00:30:13,695 --> 00:30:16,406
Are you scared they might do something?

559
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:19,784
I'm being serious,
but it seems like you're enjoying this.

560
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,496
Don't worry.

561
00:30:22,579 --> 00:30:24,456
I'll be sure to tell them next time.

562
00:30:28,251 --> 00:30:29,085
Next time?

563
00:30:29,711 --> 00:30:31,505
Yes, I have to see them for something.

564
00:30:37,204 --> 00:30:39,873
Goodness. You must be scared.

565
00:30:40,749 --> 00:30:43,544
I think he was abandoned. He's hurt too.

566
00:30:43,627 --> 00:30:44,836
Goodness, what happened?

567
00:30:45,546 --> 00:30:47,005
Gosh, you poor thing.

568
00:30:49,633 --> 00:30:50,759
Goodness.

569
00:30:51,426 --> 00:30:52,886
Please take good care of him.

570
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,805
All right, we'll look after it.

571
00:30:54,888 --> 00:30:55,806
Thank you.

572
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,266
Be good.

573
00:31:02,354 --> 00:31:04,106
I'm sorry you didn't find your cat.

574
00:31:05,107 --> 00:31:06,692
I'll just have to keep looking.

575
00:31:07,693 --> 00:31:09,236
Thank you so much for earlier.

576
00:31:14,199 --> 00:31:15,742
Did you know?

577
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:19,580
They say cats give back
as much as they receive.

578
00:31:21,123 --> 00:31:22,082
Says who?

579
00:31:22,791 --> 00:31:23,792
My aunt.

580
00:31:29,798 --> 00:31:31,133
How cute.

581
00:31:32,092 --> 00:31:34,970
Aunt Sun, do you like cats or me more?

582
00:31:36,888 --> 00:31:38,515
Why would you ask that?

583
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:42,227
Because you're always buying
something yummy for cats.

584
00:31:42,853 --> 00:31:47,149
But you get to eat
whatever you want all the time.

585
00:31:50,402 --> 00:31:53,113
Cats can't even kiss you like this though.

586
00:31:53,196 --> 00:31:54,948
Still, they know.

587
00:31:55,032 --> 00:31:55,949
Know what?

588
00:31:56,033 --> 00:31:59,453
Cats have special eyes.

589
00:31:59,703 --> 00:32:03,540
They never forget those they love.

590
00:32:03,624 --> 00:32:06,835
They give back as much as they receive.

591
00:32:07,711 --> 00:32:09,921
Really?

592
00:32:10,005 --> 00:32:11,757
Yes, really.

593
00:32:13,258 --> 00:32:15,886
Then, I want to feed the cat too.

594
00:32:15,969 --> 00:32:16,970
Okay.

595
00:32:26,146 --> 00:32:28,440
You must've been close with your aunt.

596
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,902
I resemble her a lot.

597
00:32:32,361 --> 00:32:34,071
People said I looked like her daughter.

598
00:32:36,615 --> 00:32:39,326
I think I liked her
more than my mom back then.

599
00:32:40,452 --> 00:32:41,453
What about now?

600
00:32:44,456 --> 00:32:45,374
Now?

601
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,213
I like her a lot now too.

602
00:32:52,172 --> 00:32:53,173
And I miss her.

603
00:33:03,975 --> 00:33:06,144
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

604
00:33:06,228 --> 00:33:07,479
Seriously.

605
00:33:15,987 --> 00:33:16,822
Be quiet!

606
00:33:17,489 --> 00:33:19,241
You here on vacation?

607
00:33:19,324 --> 00:33:21,702
The tests came back negative.

608
00:33:25,372 --> 00:33:26,456
Sit up straight!

609
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,793
You should apologize
and pray for a suspended sentence.

610
00:33:29,876 --> 00:33:31,670
How dare you chew your gum here?

611
00:33:31,753 --> 00:33:34,715
- What a boomer.
- Don't use your middle finger!

612
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:37,676
Forget it. We'll charge them
with drug use and theft.

613
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:38,719
Send them to juvie.

614
00:33:38,802 --> 00:33:40,303
Juvie? What did we do wrong?

615
00:33:40,387 --> 00:33:42,723
He's a damn thug, not a prosecutor!

616
00:33:42,806 --> 00:33:44,891
You've got a mouth on you for a student.

617
00:33:44,975 --> 00:33:46,059
I'm not a student.

618
00:33:46,143 --> 00:33:47,853
I looked into it, and they're not.

619
00:33:47,936 --> 00:33:50,522
They were expelled last year
and are no long minors.

620
00:33:50,605 --> 00:33:52,023
They're legal adults now.

621
00:33:52,107 --> 00:33:54,317
Then, why are they wearing uniforms?
It's confusing.

622
00:33:54,401 --> 00:33:57,028
When you wear a uniform,
it's easier to catfish

623
00:33:57,112 --> 00:33:58,905
stupid women like the one from last night.

624
00:33:59,906 --> 00:34:00,741
Catfish?

625
00:34:05,537 --> 00:34:06,747
They're so delicious.

626
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,165
What's with her?

627
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:11,501
But is this really
a prosecutor's office?

628
00:34:12,294 --> 00:34:15,005
Why is there an old lady here?

629
00:34:15,964 --> 00:34:17,299
She'd be a voice phishing victim.

630
00:34:17,382 --> 00:34:18,508
That was funny!

631
00:34:18,592 --> 00:34:21,595
Enough with the nonsense,
and just answer the questions.

632
00:34:21,678 --> 00:34:23,138
Where did you get the drug patches?

633
00:34:23,221 --> 00:34:25,098
What's that? Are they snacks?

634
00:34:27,058 --> 00:34:28,935
- Shut your mouth.
- "Shut your mouth."

635
00:34:30,103 --> 00:34:31,730
The thing on your arm.

636
00:34:33,023 --> 00:34:34,399
That thing?

637
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:36,735
It's a contraceptive patch.

638
00:34:37,319 --> 00:34:39,988
You better answer him properly!

639
00:34:40,071 --> 00:34:41,615
Is he going to hit him?

640
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:46,453
You should answer properly
for your own good.

641
00:34:46,536 --> 00:34:49,414
If we do,
then you won't call us back here?

642
00:34:49,539 --> 00:34:50,499
If you answer right.

643
00:34:50,582 --> 00:34:52,501
- You won't call our parents?
- It depends on you.

644
00:34:53,376 --> 00:34:54,211
Okay.

645
00:34:55,003 --> 00:34:57,005
I'll say it only once, so listen up.

646
00:34:57,088 --> 00:34:58,423
Wait a second.

647
00:35:04,596 --> 00:35:07,307
In game, there's an expert sniper
who loves reggae.

648
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,767
I bought an item from them.

649
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,894
I'm a Lieutenant,
and to move up to Commander,

650
00:35:10,977 --> 00:35:12,521
I have to take out snipers in Area A.

651
00:35:12,604 --> 00:35:13,897
Cap the hidden enemy sniper

652
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,358
and push with rifles
while watching the stairs.

653
00:35:16,441 --> 00:35:18,693
But the tank in front of me
threw a sick grenade.

654
00:35:18,777 --> 00:35:20,445
She was my type, so I asked her out.

655
00:35:20,529 --> 00:35:23,031
She said she knew
a great spot to grub, so I said "Cool."

656
00:35:23,114 --> 00:35:26,368
But she brought rejects with her.
What am I, some kind of fool?

657
00:35:26,952 --> 00:35:29,788
The food wasn't good, she was clueless,
and I couldn't fake it anymore.

658
00:35:29,871 --> 00:35:31,414
- Right.
- So I complained.

659
00:35:31,498 --> 00:35:32,749
And she called some loser over.

660
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:34,167
He's the one who brought it.

661
00:35:34,251 --> 00:35:35,252
Well, it was…

662
00:35:35,627 --> 00:35:36,962
A disaster I brought upon myself.

663
00:35:37,045 --> 00:35:39,256
Take it easy. How can they understand?

664
00:35:39,881 --> 00:35:40,841
Mr. Ju?

665
00:35:40,924 --> 00:35:42,467
Was that too much?

666
00:35:43,176 --> 00:35:44,386
Then, don't ask.

667
00:35:46,346 --> 00:35:47,264
Did you record that?

668
00:35:47,764 --> 00:35:49,224
I can't translate it. It's useless.

669
00:35:49,307 --> 00:35:50,934
You didn't understand any of it?

670
00:35:51,893 --> 00:35:55,397
I think he mentioned a German bar.

671
00:35:56,481 --> 00:35:57,566
I see.

672
00:35:57,649 --> 00:35:59,025
Excuse me.

673
00:36:00,277 --> 00:36:02,153
I'll interpret it.

674
00:36:02,696 --> 00:36:03,530
What?

675
00:36:04,155 --> 00:36:05,532
The lady said she'll interpret.

676
00:36:06,283 --> 00:36:07,826
As if she'd know.

677
00:36:07,909 --> 00:36:10,245
The young man wanted to level up.

678
00:36:10,328 --> 00:36:13,623
He bought an in-game item,
and while playing said game,

679
00:36:14,332 --> 00:36:18,920
he met someone online to team up with
and became attracted to her.

680
00:36:19,004 --> 00:36:22,841
So they decided to meet offline too.

681
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,926
Shot.

682
00:36:25,677 --> 00:36:27,262
Hey, we got one.

683
00:36:28,555 --> 00:36:30,098
Ask if we can get a discount.

684
00:36:30,181 --> 00:36:32,058
She said we can.

685
00:36:37,147 --> 00:36:38,815
General Toothpick?

686
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:40,567
Wow.

687
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,235
I'm Master Expert Sniper.

688
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:43,403
Hi.

689
00:36:47,532 --> 00:36:48,366
Ha-yeong!

690
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:51,453
Over here!

691
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,747
My friends!

692
00:36:55,707 --> 00:36:56,541
What?

693
00:36:59,169 --> 00:37:02,881
<i>They intentionally tried
to mooch off of him.</i>

694
00:37:02,964 --> 00:37:05,592
<i>He became angry
at their unethical behavior</i>

695
00:37:05,675 --> 00:37:07,928
<i>and strongly objected.</i>

696
00:37:08,637 --> 00:37:10,221
- Are you joking?
- Just you wait.

697
00:37:10,305 --> 00:37:12,515
<i>- His online teammate?</i>
- It's me.

698
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:14,601
She called a deliveryman
she was close with.

699
00:37:16,227 --> 00:37:17,437
A grand plan.

700
00:37:19,481 --> 00:37:21,232
Anyways…

701
00:37:21,316 --> 00:37:22,943
Jeez, I'm so busy right now.

702
00:37:23,026 --> 00:37:26,488
Here, the young man learned something new.

703
00:37:26,571 --> 00:37:28,740
- Hey.
- Sir, I'm sorry.

704
00:37:28,823 --> 00:37:30,241
But it's a misunderstanding.

705
00:37:30,992 --> 00:37:32,535
I'm not the one who asked to meet.

706
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:36,373
This lady asked me out first,
so that's why I came.

707
00:37:36,456 --> 00:37:39,042
- Asked you out? Is that so?
- Yes.

708
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:41,086
- No, I didn't!
- Tell me the truth.

709
00:37:41,169 --> 00:37:43,296
He seduced me, saying he'd buy me chicken!

710
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,131
I bought you chicken yesterday!

711
00:37:45,215 --> 00:37:46,466
It was boneless!

712
00:37:46,549 --> 00:37:49,219
You should've told me then!
How else would I know?

713
00:37:49,302 --> 00:37:51,096
You've never bought me anything like this!

714
00:37:51,179 --> 00:37:52,555
- Come here, you brat!
- Let go!

715
00:37:53,181 --> 00:37:54,516
- Come here!
- Let go!

716
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:55,684
What's with you?

717
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:57,477
- You really don't know how I feel?
- No!

718
00:38:00,522 --> 00:38:02,357
<i>There was a reason
why the deliveryman came.</i>

719
00:38:03,191 --> 00:38:07,070
<i>- It was because he was her lover.</i>
- Incredible!

720
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:13,201
<i>In the end,
the deliveryman gave the young man</i>

721
00:38:13,284 --> 00:38:15,328
<i>the drug patch that's popular in clubs</i>

722
00:38:15,412 --> 00:38:17,122
<i>to settle things.</i>

723
00:38:17,831 --> 00:38:18,707
The good stuff?

724
00:38:19,416 --> 00:38:21,376
In conclusion,

725
00:38:21,459 --> 00:38:23,336
we would need to summon and question

726
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:27,382
his online teammate and the deliveryman
who personally supplied the drug patch.

727
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,395
Do you see him here?

728
00:38:43,314 --> 00:38:44,774
You said his name was Poppy.

729
00:38:44,858 --> 00:38:46,526
This guy. Poppy.

730
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,903
- Let's track him down now.
- Yes, sir

731
00:38:50,572 --> 00:38:52,574
Hey, lady. Who are you?

732
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,035
You're a Lieutenant?

733
00:39:07,464 --> 00:39:08,965
I'm a General.

734
00:39:10,091 --> 00:39:12,886
OFFICER, SENIOR OFFICER, SERGEANT,
LIEUTENANT, CAPTAIN, CHIEF, GENERAL

735
00:39:42,582 --> 00:39:43,792
Goodness.

736
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:45,293
It's not even winter.

737
00:39:45,376 --> 00:39:47,212
- Isn't that fur vest hot?
- Right.

738
00:39:47,295 --> 00:39:48,546
Can't you hear me?

739
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,215
Take it off.

740
00:39:50,298 --> 00:39:51,674
- Okay?
- What?

741
00:39:51,758 --> 00:39:53,384
Take them off. Aren't you hot?

742
00:39:53,468 --> 00:39:54,844
It's not hot at all!

743
00:39:54,928 --> 00:39:56,471
It's nice and warm.

744
00:39:57,514 --> 00:39:58,556
Hey.

745
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,724
You're sweating.

746
00:40:00,266 --> 00:40:01,851
Just take it off.

747
00:40:01,935 --> 00:40:03,186
I can't.

748
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:06,606
My civil servant daughter bought it
for me with her first paycheck.

749
00:40:07,357 --> 00:40:11,361
Goodness. So you were wearing that
to brag about your daughter.

750
00:40:12,403 --> 00:40:14,614
Want to feel it? It's expensive.

751
00:40:15,907 --> 00:40:17,784
Goodness.

752
00:40:17,867 --> 00:40:19,035
- It's soft.
- Isn't it?

753
00:40:19,911 --> 00:40:20,787
It's so soft.

754
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:23,248
That's enough. It's new.
You'll wear it out.

755
00:40:23,957 --> 00:40:24,958
Did Mi-jin buy it?

756
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:26,042
Of course.

757
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,962
- It suits me well, right?
- I guess.

758
00:40:29,712 --> 00:40:31,131
It's nice. I'm jealous.

759
00:40:31,214 --> 00:40:32,215
Right?

760
00:40:33,675 --> 00:40:36,845
You won't freeze to death
in the freezer now. It's perfect.

761
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,893
Just take them off.

762
00:40:43,977 --> 00:40:45,395
I'm not hot.

763
00:40:45,478 --> 00:40:46,980
Looking at you is making me hot!

764
00:40:47,063 --> 00:40:49,107
Either take the top off or the bottom!

765
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:52,110
If it bothers you that much,
turn on the AC then.

766
00:40:52,193 --> 00:40:54,487
My goodness. Summer's already over.

767
00:40:54,571 --> 00:40:55,905
Don't be ridiculous.

768
00:40:55,989 --> 00:40:58,992
Jeez. You own this building.

769
00:40:59,075 --> 00:41:01,744
And you can't even spend
a few pennies on electricity?

770
00:41:01,828 --> 00:41:03,580
Why did you even install the AC?

771
00:41:03,663 --> 00:41:05,957
Is it to block out the wind in the winter?

772
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,876
You must be boiling hot.

773
00:41:07,959 --> 00:41:09,711
I said I'm not hot!

774
00:41:09,794 --> 00:41:11,296
Unbelievable.

775
00:41:11,379 --> 00:41:12,714
Goodness.

776
00:41:12,797 --> 00:41:15,925
It's slowly going to get cold now.

777
00:41:16,009 --> 00:41:20,138
I wonder if the prosecutor's apartment
has good heating.

778
00:41:21,097 --> 00:41:22,182
What prosecutor?

779
00:41:22,265 --> 00:41:24,225
The one our Mi-jin is dating.

780
00:41:24,809 --> 00:41:26,728
Your tenant.

781
00:41:27,353 --> 00:41:28,354
He's a prosecutor.

782
00:41:29,981 --> 00:41:31,024
Prosecutor?

783
00:41:31,941 --> 00:41:35,028
The same ones from TV
who question people?

784
00:41:35,111 --> 00:41:36,029
Those prosecutors?

785
00:41:36,112 --> 00:41:39,324
Yeah, those extraordinary prosecutors.

786
00:41:40,408 --> 00:41:41,784
Your first time seeing one, right?

787
00:41:42,952 --> 00:41:44,287
Mine too.

788
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:46,748
My goodness.

789
00:41:46,831 --> 00:41:48,917
Wow. My goodness.

790
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,293
This is crazy.

791
00:41:50,376 --> 00:41:54,130
Do you think I'll be sued
for leasing a haunted house?

792
00:41:54,214 --> 00:41:57,342
I've always told you
to act with more of a conscience.

793
00:41:57,425 --> 00:41:59,469
Serves you right.

794
00:41:59,552 --> 00:42:01,012
There he goes.

795
00:42:03,932 --> 00:42:04,933
Goodness.

796
00:42:05,475 --> 00:42:06,476
Hello.

797
00:42:07,393 --> 00:42:10,271
I have to speak with you…

798
00:42:11,814 --> 00:42:14,108
About something.

799
00:42:14,192 --> 00:42:15,443
What is it?

800
00:42:15,526 --> 00:42:16,945
When you signed your lease,

801
00:42:17,028 --> 00:42:20,198
you should've told me
that you were a prosecutor.

802
00:42:21,366 --> 00:42:24,244
Do I have to tell you my profession
when signing a lease?

803
00:42:24,327 --> 00:42:25,453
To be honest,

804
00:42:27,205 --> 00:42:30,875
this place has a slight problem.

805
00:42:31,668 --> 00:42:32,710
What problem?

806
00:42:32,794 --> 00:42:36,756
Well, it's not really a problem.

807
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:38,800
It's just a kind of…

808
00:42:39,592 --> 00:42:41,427
Let's say it has a story.

809
00:42:42,679 --> 00:42:45,181
Is there any place
without a story? It's fine.

810
00:42:46,391 --> 00:42:47,642
What?

811
00:42:47,725 --> 00:42:50,520
Someone died there.

812
00:42:59,028 --> 00:43:00,905
It's haunted.

813
00:43:05,702 --> 00:43:07,829
It doesn't matter.
Was there anything else?

814
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,164
Nope.

815
00:43:10,748 --> 00:43:11,749
Have a good night.

816
00:43:15,628 --> 00:43:16,629
What was that?

817
00:43:18,047 --> 00:43:19,674
It's like he already knew.

818
00:43:22,135 --> 00:43:23,469
Does he like ghosts?

819
00:43:24,804 --> 00:43:25,972
My goodness.

820
00:43:26,055 --> 00:43:27,515

823
00:43:44,824 --> 00:43:46,326
ACID ATTACKER CAUGHT BY 50-YEAR-OLD!

824
00:44:06,763 --> 00:44:08,139
You said you'd cheer me up.

825
00:44:08,222 --> 00:44:09,682
This is making me feel worse.

826
00:44:09,766 --> 00:44:12,060
We shouldn't let free tickets go to waste.

827
00:44:18,816 --> 00:44:20,234
You've been busy job hunting

828
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:23,029
and gone through so much
that you never had a chance to relax.

829
00:44:23,696 --> 00:44:26,074
Jeez, just enjoy yourself now!

830
00:44:26,699 --> 00:44:28,034
Come on.

831
00:44:28,659 --> 00:44:31,162
Yeah, my best friend's the only one
who thinks about me.

832
00:44:31,245 --> 00:44:32,705
What would I do without you?

833
00:44:32,789 --> 00:44:33,623
Take a video of me.

834
00:44:35,666 --> 00:44:37,293
Now, follow me!

835
00:44:39,754 --> 00:44:41,380
Call my name.

836
00:44:43,633 --> 00:44:45,134
Good!

837
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,553
Turn around.

838
00:44:47,637 --> 00:44:49,430
- That's good.
- Make me look tall.

839
00:44:49,514 --> 00:44:51,390
Right. You look short though.

840
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:59,023
- How many times do we have to do this?
- Do it one more time.

841
00:44:59,107 --> 00:45:00,608
Gosh, you're so obsessed with photos.

842
00:45:14,288 --> 00:45:15,998
Hello. Did you come here alone?

843
00:45:16,833 --> 00:45:19,335
I came here with a friend.

844
00:45:19,418 --> 00:45:20,795
- Really?
- Yeah.

845
00:45:20,878 --> 00:45:22,255
Hello.

846
00:45:22,338 --> 00:45:24,966
Ga-yeong, they didn't have
strawberry frappuccinos.

847
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:27,593
You came with your mother.

848
00:45:27,677 --> 00:45:29,428
- I'm her friend.
- She's not my mom.

849
00:45:29,512 --> 00:45:31,597
- Have a great time.
- We hope you have fun.

850
00:45:31,681 --> 00:45:32,515
Friend?

851
00:45:32,598 --> 00:45:34,016
- My friend.
- Bye.

852
00:45:34,642 --> 00:45:36,102
Who were they? You know them?

853
00:45:36,185 --> 00:45:38,020
I could've known them.

854
00:45:41,107 --> 00:45:44,443
Cheers. Thanks, Mi-jin.

855
00:45:57,748 --> 00:46:00,084
My goodness.
Those are the clothes I put in the hamper.

856
00:46:00,168 --> 00:46:04,005
It must be your good looks,
because those colors really suit you too.

857
00:46:04,088 --> 00:46:05,715
It looks better on him than you!

858
00:46:09,802 --> 00:46:11,304
Here. Take this with you.

859
00:46:11,387 --> 00:46:12,805
- It's fine.
- Please.

860
00:46:12,889 --> 00:46:16,267
From now on,
saying "It's fine" will be prohibited.

863
00:46:52,887 --> 00:46:54,513
<i>Do you have time to meet up?</i>

864
00:47:04,273 --> 00:47:05,107
Mi-jin, look.

865
00:47:05,191 --> 00:47:06,484
Overhead photo. Two, three.

866
00:47:07,526 --> 00:47:08,486
Two, three.

867
00:47:08,569 --> 00:47:09,946
Christmas tree!

868
00:47:10,029 --> 00:47:12,073
It's so pretty! Let's take one here.

869
00:47:12,865 --> 00:47:13,783
Come on.

870
00:47:13,866 --> 00:47:16,369
This is really the last one.
Just one more.

871
00:47:16,452 --> 00:47:18,246
- I swear.
- We've been at it for hours.

872
00:47:18,329 --> 00:47:19,497
We keep taking videos.

873
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:20,581
Just help me out a bit!

874
00:47:20,665 --> 00:47:21,916
I finally got a sponsor.

875
00:47:21,999 --> 00:47:23,751
You brought me here for this, didn't you?

876
00:47:23,834 --> 00:47:24,710
Of course not!

877
00:47:24,794 --> 00:47:26,712
This trip is for both work and pleasure.

878
00:47:26,796 --> 00:47:28,589
Make money and play for free.

879
00:47:28,673 --> 00:47:29,882
It's the best of two worlds.

880
00:47:29,966 --> 00:47:31,759
Kill two birds with one stone!

881
00:47:31,842 --> 00:47:32,927
- So nice!
- Ridiculous.

882
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:34,679
That stone's going to kill me.

883
00:47:34,762 --> 00:47:36,973
Let's be honest.

884
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,642
- You can't even have fun.
- Hey.

885
00:47:39,725 --> 00:47:42,228
Once the sun goes down and you come back,

886
00:47:42,311 --> 00:47:44,230
that's when we were going to have fun!

887
00:47:44,313 --> 00:47:45,982
I'm exhausted now.

888
00:47:46,065 --> 00:47:48,234
When is the sun going to set?

889
00:47:48,317 --> 00:47:49,151
SEOHAN SUNSET TIME

890
00:47:49,235 --> 00:47:50,319
What do we do?

891
00:47:50,403 --> 00:47:51,862
Go before you change.

892
00:47:51,946 --> 00:47:53,447
- Okay!
- Here's the key!

893
00:47:54,323 --> 00:47:55,283
Bye!

894
00:47:55,366 --> 00:47:56,617
I'll be waiting here.

895
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:01,414
A video this time.

896
00:48:01,497 --> 00:48:03,082
Hey, everyone!

897
00:48:03,165 --> 00:48:05,209
Christmas tree.

898
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:09,046
Where did she go?

899
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,841
Damn it. She could've lost my phone.

900
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:22,226
What?

901
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:24,145
Hello, are you here alone?

902
00:48:24,228 --> 00:48:25,646
Would you like to hang out?

903
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:27,565
No, I have to look for my friend.

904
00:48:28,232 --> 00:48:30,943
That's great. There are two of us too.

905
00:48:31,027 --> 00:48:32,028
How about a drink?

906
00:48:32,528 --> 00:48:33,654
She has company.

907
00:48:37,992 --> 00:48:39,577
Have a great time.

908
00:48:41,912 --> 00:48:43,372
What are you doing here?

909
00:48:43,456 --> 00:48:45,416
Exactly. Why tell me to come here?

910
00:48:46,042 --> 00:48:48,627
I had my doubts,
but it really is a water park.

911
00:48:48,711 --> 00:48:49,795
- I did?
- Yes.

912
00:48:49,879 --> 00:48:52,214
You texted me to come here.
You sent a map too.

913
00:48:54,216 --> 00:48:56,052
<i>I told the prosecutor to come.</i>

914
00:48:56,761 --> 00:48:57,887
It's a tree!

915
00:49:00,848 --> 00:49:02,391
Jeez, she forgot her phone.

916
00:49:05,811 --> 00:49:07,271
<i>Do you have time to meet up?</i>

917
00:49:14,028 --> 00:49:15,279
<i>Sure! Let's meet now!</i>

918
00:49:15,363 --> 00:49:17,740
<i>I'll send you the address. Please hurry!</i>

919
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:19,784
<i>The game's been set, so enjoy the match.</i>

920
00:49:19,867 --> 00:49:20,868
That crazy…

921
00:49:22,203 --> 00:49:23,829
Are you going to keep swimming?

922
00:49:27,917 --> 00:49:29,126
Probably not, right?

923
00:49:41,222 --> 00:49:45,434
Jeez, summer's over now.
Why are there still so many bugs?

924
00:49:45,518 --> 00:49:47,937
- They're not on me.
- Yes, they are. Look closely.

925
00:49:48,896 --> 00:49:50,815
But why did you want to see me?

926
00:49:51,399 --> 00:49:52,400
Here.

927
00:49:54,652 --> 00:49:57,238
What is this?
Did you pick this up on your way here?

928
00:50:00,116 --> 00:50:01,283
I see.

929
00:50:01,367 --> 00:50:03,202
Tell your mother I enjoyed them.

930
00:50:03,911 --> 00:50:06,330
You called me
on a weekend night for this?

931
00:50:06,872 --> 00:50:07,915
And all the way out here?

932
00:50:08,666 --> 00:50:12,461
I was going to come by your house.
But it's nice to get some air too.

933
00:50:13,295 --> 00:50:15,256
Should I just kill Ga-yeong?

934
00:50:15,923 --> 00:50:16,799
By the way,

935
00:50:17,883 --> 00:50:20,636
you really don't remember that night?

936
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:22,888
- It'd be awful if I remembered.
- What?

937
00:50:23,806 --> 00:50:28,602
So what I'm saying is
I don't remember anything at all.

938
00:50:28,686 --> 00:50:29,770
Yeah.

939
00:50:30,646 --> 00:50:32,481
That's what I mean.

940
00:50:33,399 --> 00:50:34,400
I swear.

941
00:50:57,506 --> 00:51:00,342
<i>Gye Ji-ung, Gye Ji-ung</i>

942
00:51:00,426 --> 00:51:03,345
<i>Gye Ji-ung</i>

943
00:51:03,429 --> 00:51:06,891
<i>The world hasn't changed</i>

944
00:51:06,974 --> 00:51:10,394
<i>Time is passing by</i>

945
00:51:10,478 --> 00:51:13,606
<i>But I'm the only one</i>

946
00:51:13,689 --> 00:51:17,860
<i>Who has changed</i>

947
00:51:17,943 --> 00:51:21,572
<i>Scattered by the wind</i>

948
00:51:21,655 --> 00:51:25,576
<i>My wishes made in vain</i>

949
00:51:25,659 --> 00:51:28,204
<i>Frustratingly</i>

950
00:51:29,205 --> 00:51:35,252
<i>Disappear</i>

951
00:51:35,336 --> 00:51:37,213
Is it a crime to be old?

952
00:51:37,296 --> 00:51:38,923
You think you won't grow old?

953
00:51:39,006 --> 00:51:41,967
You'll be an old man soon
and a grandpa in an instant!

954
00:51:44,261 --> 00:51:47,306
<i>Why look down on age? Why?</i>

955
00:51:47,389 --> 00:51:51,393
Don't you know the saying,
"Young at heart"?

956
00:51:51,477 --> 00:51:53,646
The old lady you work with.

957
00:51:53,729 --> 00:51:56,815
<i>If you don't want to work with her,
just tell her to leave.</i>

958
00:51:56,899 --> 00:51:58,567
<i>Why didn't you fire her?</i>

959
00:51:58,651 --> 00:51:59,985
Because you pitied her?

960
00:52:00,069 --> 00:52:01,654
Or did you just totally ignore her?

961
00:52:01,737 --> 00:52:02,696
Why won't you answer?

962
00:52:04,615 --> 00:52:05,699
Damn it.

963
00:52:17,419 --> 00:52:18,254
Hello?

964
00:52:20,256 --> 00:52:21,257
<i>Hello?</i>

965
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,134
<i>Mi-jin.</i>

966
00:52:32,726 --> 00:52:33,936
<i>Because she was like me.</i>

967
00:52:36,313 --> 00:52:38,190
<i>She looked like she had
nowhere else to go.</i>

968
00:53:31,368 --> 00:53:35,039
INVESTIGATOR JU BYEONG-DEOK

969
00:53:35,873 --> 00:53:36,749
Hello, Mr. Ju.

970
00:53:37,333 --> 00:53:39,043
He's been off-grid for a few days now.

971
00:53:40,002 --> 00:53:43,088
He caught wind of the students
being investigated and ran.

972
00:53:44,965 --> 00:53:47,176
If he went into hiding,
let's lure him out.

973
00:53:47,259 --> 00:53:48,344
How?

974
00:53:48,427 --> 00:53:52,139
His girlfriend is active online,
so let's use that.

975
00:53:52,973 --> 00:53:54,850
Do you think that's possible?

976
00:53:59,755 --> 00:54:01,590
- You need me?
- Yes.

977
00:54:01,674 --> 00:54:03,926
We need your exceptional skills.

978
00:54:06,721 --> 00:54:08,139
You can ask me anything.

979
00:54:08,222 --> 00:54:09,348
It's about video games.

980
00:54:10,641 --> 00:54:11,559
- Video games?
- Yes.

981
00:54:11,642 --> 00:54:13,060
Just find the woman who sold

982
00:54:13,144 --> 00:54:15,479
the in-game item
to that young man we questioned.

983
00:54:15,563 --> 00:54:17,606
In other words, log on and keep watch.

984
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:18,983
All you have to do is

985
00:54:19,066 --> 00:54:21,819
try to make a deal,
and we'll do the rest.

986
00:54:21,902 --> 00:54:23,320
A deal for an in-game item?

987
00:54:23,404 --> 00:54:26,365
That's right.
She's even stolen from students.

988
00:54:26,449 --> 00:54:28,159
We'll get her quick if we do it right.

989
00:54:28,242 --> 00:54:30,411
She's likely pressed for money
while in hiding too.

990
00:54:30,494 --> 00:54:33,497
Right. At that level,
she's probably addicted.

991
00:54:33,581 --> 00:54:35,875
- She'd play every day.
- But can you do it?

992
00:54:35,958 --> 00:54:39,211
Of course. I'll find her. Sure.

993
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:46,218
Once you find her and approach her,

994
00:54:46,302 --> 00:54:47,845
induce an offline meeting.

995
00:54:47,928 --> 00:54:51,432
Whether it's for an in-game item
or friendship, do whatever you can.

996
00:54:52,016 --> 00:54:53,517
What will happen after that?

997
00:54:54,185 --> 00:54:56,604
We'll follow her
and discover where she's hiding.

998
00:54:56,687 --> 00:54:59,690
Or we'll provoke her
to call her boyfriend like that kid did.

999
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:10,951
This is driving me crazy.
I can't even play.

1000
00:55:12,912 --> 00:55:15,414
<i>Skins and items are for sale. Contact me!</i>

1001
00:55:15,498 --> 00:55:16,415
What?

1002
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:18,834
Hell yeah.

1003
00:55:18,918 --> 00:55:20,419
She's here!

1004
00:55:20,503 --> 00:55:22,296
<i>I want to buy both.</i>

1005
00:55:22,379 --> 00:55:23,380
Let's eat some chicken.

1006
00:55:24,131 --> 00:55:26,467
<i>Deal. No discounts. Is that okay?</i>

1007
00:55:27,301 --> 00:55:29,887
<i>- Nice! Can I get a small discount?
- Let me think.</i>

1008
00:55:30,763 --> 00:55:31,847
<i>I'll buy you chicken.</i>

1009
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:34,975
<i>Deal.</i>

1010
00:55:37,061 --> 00:55:39,104
We agreed to meet on Thursday at 4 p.m.!

1011
00:55:39,188 --> 00:55:40,105
Really?

1012
00:55:40,189 --> 00:55:41,190
Yes.

1013
00:55:46,862 --> 00:55:47,696
<i>- Ga-yeong!
- What?</i>

1014
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:50,449
- I'm in charge of an investigation!
- What?

1015
00:55:51,492 --> 00:55:53,244
- Did something happen?
- Where do I start?

1016
00:55:53,327 --> 00:55:54,411
- What is it?
- Hey.

1017
00:55:54,495 --> 00:55:56,121
- I need some makeup.
- Makeup?

1018
00:55:56,205 --> 00:55:57,915
Make me look like an intellectual.

1019
00:55:57,998 --> 00:55:58,999
- Okay.
- You know.

1020
00:55:59,083 --> 00:56:00,543
- Like Scully!
- I don't know.

1021
00:56:00,626 --> 00:56:01,669
Scully wasn't old.

1022
00:56:01,752 --> 00:56:03,754
I need some thick eyeliner.

1023
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:06,048
Thick? Okay.

1024
00:56:06,131 --> 00:56:08,133
I'll just draw on thick eyeliner then.

1025
00:56:09,051 --> 00:56:10,052
Yeah.

1026
00:56:10,135 --> 00:56:11,178
Shut your eyes.

1027
00:56:14,265 --> 00:56:16,350
- Am I late?
- How thick does it have to be?

1028
00:56:16,433 --> 00:56:17,434
Wait.

1029
00:56:19,019 --> 00:56:21,063
You scared me! Jeez, come on!

1030
00:56:21,146 --> 00:56:22,648
- Jeez.
- What do I do?

1031
00:56:22,731 --> 00:56:25,192
<i>I can't come at 4 p.m.
I'll see you at 8 p.m.</i>

1032
00:56:25,276 --> 00:56:27,361
The sun's gone by then. What will you do?

1033
00:56:27,444 --> 00:56:28,445
I'm screwed.

1034
00:56:29,321 --> 00:56:31,282
No, I have to fix this.

1035
00:56:31,365 --> 00:56:33,492
How? How will you fix this?

1036
00:56:33,576 --> 00:56:35,327
I have to or the investigation's ruined.

1037
00:56:35,411 --> 00:56:37,204
But how?

1038
00:56:37,288 --> 00:56:39,123
What are you going to do?

1039
00:56:39,206 --> 00:56:40,708
<i>Can you come any sooner?</i>

1040
00:56:40,791 --> 00:56:42,960
<i>In return, I'll buy you
two whole chickens.</i>

1041
00:56:43,919 --> 00:56:46,046
<i>I'm full, so two is too much.</i>

1042
00:56:47,089 --> 00:56:48,215
Muscle building.

1043
00:56:48,299 --> 00:56:50,593
- Yeah.
- Good, right? Okay, for bulking up.

1044
00:56:50,676 --> 00:56:53,053
<i>I'm exercising to build muscle.
I can't meet at night.</i>

1045
00:56:54,138 --> 00:56:55,598
<i>You must have a nice body.</i>

1046
00:56:56,432 --> 00:56:58,434
"You must have a nice body."

1047
00:56:59,643 --> 00:57:01,562
<i>Okay, I'll see you at 6 p.m.</i>

1048
00:57:01,645 --> 00:57:03,063
Hey, when's sunset today?

1049
00:57:03,147 --> 00:57:04,273
Sunset? Hold on.

1050
00:57:06,775 --> 00:57:07,610
It's at 7 p.m.

1051
00:57:07,693 --> 00:57:09,153
- That's a bit risky.
- Yeah.

1052
00:57:09,236 --> 00:57:10,654
What if you end up caught?

1053
00:57:13,324 --> 00:57:14,742
<i>I'll see you at 6 p.m. then.</i>

1054
00:57:14,825 --> 00:57:15,993
Is that okay?

1055
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:17,536
- Let's try.
- Try?

1056
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:18,787
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's try!

1057
00:57:18,871 --> 00:57:19,872
Let's give it a try.

1058
00:57:21,248 --> 00:57:22,458
I'M EXERCISING TO BUILD MUSCLE

1059
00:57:22,541 --> 00:57:23,918
"Build muscle"?

1060
00:57:24,543 --> 00:57:26,086
How much muscle?

1061
00:57:27,838 --> 00:57:29,506
Jeez. I'll go then.

1062
00:57:31,258 --> 00:57:32,760
Substance is what's important.

1063
00:57:33,802 --> 00:57:34,803
I'll watch the back.

1064
00:57:34,887 --> 00:57:36,138
Should I watch the front?

1065
00:57:36,222 --> 00:57:38,807
Another chest pain would be dangerous.
Don't come out.

1066
00:57:38,891 --> 00:57:40,601
I can't be the only one to sit out.

1067
00:57:40,684 --> 00:57:41,936
We should do it together.

1068
00:57:42,019 --> 00:57:44,521
Your job was up to this point.
It's fine. You did great.

1069
00:57:50,069 --> 00:57:53,822
<i>True. It'd be bad if the sun sets
and my face changes.</i>

1070
00:58:54,049 --> 00:58:55,426
She's here.

1071
00:58:56,844 --> 00:58:58,304
SHE'S HERE!

1072
00:59:06,812 --> 00:59:08,355
This is her, right?

1073
00:59:51,106 --> 00:59:52,691
Semi-basement King?

1074
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,818
Sniper Master?

1075
00:59:56,570 --> 00:59:59,156
You really have built up a lot of muscle.

1076
01:00:13,003 --> 01:00:14,338
What in the world?

1077
01:00:14,421 --> 01:00:16,131
What? Is she looking at us?

1078
01:00:22,971 --> 01:00:23,806
Please eat.

1079
01:00:24,515 --> 01:00:28,018
- I'm usually a picky eater.
- I see.

1080
01:00:29,061 --> 01:00:29,937
It's so hot.

1081
01:00:31,188 --> 01:00:32,022
Are you hot?

1082
01:00:36,652 --> 01:00:38,112
Is it the heat?

1083
01:00:38,195 --> 01:00:39,655
I want a drink.

1084
01:00:39,738 --> 01:00:41,949
Drinks? This early?

1085
01:00:42,032 --> 01:00:44,410
Drinking's better
when the sun's still out.

1086
01:00:44,952 --> 01:00:47,162
All you do is work out,
so you must not know.

1087
01:00:48,455 --> 01:00:50,374
- Ma'am! Two beers, please!
- All right.

1088
01:00:50,457 --> 01:00:51,333
Wait, I…

1089
01:00:53,544 --> 01:00:54,378
I don't…

1090
01:00:57,089 --> 01:00:58,215
What's going on?

1091
01:01:12,938 --> 01:01:15,149
- Cheers!
- I drove here.

1092
01:01:15,232 --> 01:01:16,066
I'm sorry.

1093
01:01:18,402 --> 01:01:21,238
You're making me lose my appetite.
I even gave you a discount.

1094
01:01:28,871 --> 01:01:29,872
Cheers.

1095
01:01:31,039 --> 01:01:35,043
Gosh, I told you I was upset,
and you gave in right away.

1096
01:01:36,128 --> 01:01:37,880
- Goodness.
- My gosh!

1097
01:01:39,047 --> 01:01:39,882
Damn it.

1098
01:01:44,386 --> 01:01:45,554
Seriously!

1099
01:01:45,637 --> 01:01:47,556
She has a boyfriend. What's her deal?

1100
01:01:48,974 --> 01:01:52,561
You're so funny!

1101
01:01:55,439 --> 01:01:56,565
What's that smell?

1102
01:01:58,650 --> 01:01:59,776
You smell so nice.

1103
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:01,320
That's enough!

1104
01:02:04,198 --> 01:02:05,282
I'm sorry.

1105
01:02:05,991 --> 01:02:07,868
I have to go to the bathroom.

1106
01:02:10,454 --> 01:02:11,830
Come back quickly!

1107
01:02:22,007 --> 01:02:23,383
Hey, babe.

1108
01:02:24,176 --> 01:02:25,427
I went out to sell stuff.

1109
01:02:25,511 --> 01:02:27,221
Damn, I can't hear her.

1110
01:02:27,304 --> 01:02:29,223
Sorry, I'm going to be late.

1111
01:02:29,306 --> 01:02:31,808
I'll buy you some chicken on my way back.

1112
01:02:31,892 --> 01:02:36,146
I love you! Kisses.

1113
01:02:38,815 --> 01:02:40,400
Okay.

1114
01:02:40,484 --> 01:02:42,027
RECENT
SEND

1115
01:02:43,612 --> 01:02:44,571
Okay.

1116
01:02:54,665 --> 01:02:55,499
Hey.

1117
01:02:59,962 --> 01:03:01,380
What's that?

1118
01:03:01,463 --> 01:03:02,297
She's…

1119
01:03:04,758 --> 01:03:05,968
Is she putting in drugs?

1120
01:03:06,051 --> 01:03:07,094
That crazy…

1121
01:03:07,177 --> 01:03:08,303
Seriously!

1122
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:12,975
That damn lunatic.

1123
01:03:13,058 --> 01:03:14,059
Hold on.

1124
01:03:15,352 --> 01:03:16,186
Damn it!

1125
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:17,354
Welcome back.

1126
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:22,693
This won't do.

1127
01:03:25,571 --> 01:03:27,114
OFFICE ASSISTANT LIM SUN

1128
01:03:29,157 --> 01:03:31,076
Keep your phone off until the evening.

1129
01:03:32,578 --> 01:03:33,412
What?

1130
01:03:35,372 --> 01:03:36,582
This is driving me nuts!

1131
01:03:36,665 --> 01:03:38,959
Okay. Here's your beer.

1132
01:03:41,795 --> 01:03:42,796
What time is it?

1133
01:03:58,604 --> 01:03:59,605
Damn it!

1134
01:04:00,731 --> 01:04:02,316
Damn it. For crying out loud.

1135
01:04:02,899 --> 01:04:05,277
What are you doing?

1136
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:07,237
Why aren't you drinking?

1137
01:04:07,321 --> 01:04:08,739
- Excuse me. Who are you?
- Sorry.

1138
01:04:08,822 --> 01:04:10,240
- Wait.
- I don't feel well.

1139
01:04:10,324 --> 01:04:11,742
Who are you?

1140
01:04:11,825 --> 01:04:13,577
Just one drink, okay?

1141
01:04:19,041 --> 01:04:20,626
- Hurry and drink!
- Okay.

1142
01:04:20,709 --> 01:04:21,543
Cheers.

1143
01:04:22,461 --> 01:04:24,379
Don't drink it. I saw it.

1144
01:04:24,463 --> 01:04:25,422
Cheers.

1145
01:04:26,006 --> 01:04:27,633
- Okay.
- Does your neck hurt?

1146
01:04:28,258 --> 01:04:29,343
No, I'm fine.

1147
01:04:29,426 --> 01:04:30,302
Cheers.

1148
01:04:33,096 --> 01:04:35,057
- What do you keep looking at?
- No, wait…

1149
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:36,767
Cheers.

1150
01:04:38,101 --> 01:04:40,562
It's bottoms up. You have to finish it.

1151
01:04:41,229 --> 01:04:42,147
I saw her.

1152
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:43,148
She did this.

1153
01:04:43,649 --> 01:04:45,400
Dizzy. No, don't.

1154
01:04:45,484 --> 01:04:47,027
You'll be like this.

1155
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:49,237
No.

1156
01:04:49,321 --> 01:04:50,864
No!

1157
01:05:32,406 --> 01:05:35,325
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

<i>- What's going on with you two?</i>
- He's my boyfriend!

1159
01:05:37,661 --> 01:05:40,455
- Starting today, he's mine!
<i>- Is she your girlfriend? Or a fling?</i>

1160
01:05:40,539 --> 01:05:42,416
<i>I'll wait until you can tell me.</i>

1161
01:05:44,543 --> 01:05:47,671
<i>So the person who saved you, Lim Sun?
There aren't any records of her.</i>

1162
01:05:47,754 --> 01:05:49,673
<i>You know this is really suspicious, right?</i>

1163
01:05:49,756 --> 01:05:51,299
<i>When Aunt Sun disappeared…</i>

1164
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:54,678
<i>Are you saying
it's my fault she disappeared?</i>

1165
01:05:55,387 --> 01:05:56,471
<i>Director Baek Cheol-gyu.</i>

1166
