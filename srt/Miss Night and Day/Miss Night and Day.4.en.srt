1
00:00:00,086 --> 00:00:02,020
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

2
00:00:02,101 --> 00:00:05,472
THE FOLLOWING PROGRAM IS NOT
SUITABLE FOR VIEWERS UNDER 15

3
00:00:05,553 --> 00:00:08,753
VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED

4
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:11,955
THIS PROGRAM CONTAINS PRODUCT PLACEMENTS
AND VIRTUAL ADVERTISING

5
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:13,771
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

6
00:00:13,852 --> 00:00:15,235
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

7
00:00:19,071 --> 00:00:20,823
- Goodness.
- A special position?

8
00:00:20,906 --> 00:00:22,116
Are you okay?

9
00:00:23,909 --> 00:00:25,536
Yes, well…

10
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,665
It's better than being a contract worker.
You're practically a civil servant.

11
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:31,542
Gosh.

12
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:34,003
My dream was to become a civil servant.

13
00:00:36,171 --> 00:00:37,590
That's great!

14
00:00:38,674 --> 00:00:39,925
It's settled then!

15
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,054
What's wrong?

16
00:00:45,598 --> 00:00:49,977
But does it have to be for Mr. Gye?

17
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,979
Hey! Come on!

18
00:00:52,896 --> 00:00:55,232
It seems you've heard the rumors,

19
00:00:55,316 --> 00:00:58,068
but they're not true at all.

20
00:00:58,152 --> 00:01:02,406
Mr. Gye's not as grouchy, sensitive,
or difficult as you think he is.

21
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:04,158
He's not like that at all!

22
00:01:04,241 --> 00:01:05,784
Well, maybe a little.

23
00:01:05,868 --> 00:01:07,286
Yeah. Just a tiny bit.

24
00:01:10,664 --> 00:01:13,125
Then, does that mean Mr. Gye…

25
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,253
What?

26
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:22,051
I already knew.

27
00:01:22,885 --> 00:01:24,511
He's the "cold exterior" type.

28
00:01:24,595 --> 00:01:27,014
- Cold what?
- The "cold exterior" type.

29
00:01:28,182 --> 00:01:30,351
He's cold on the outside,

30
00:01:30,434 --> 00:01:33,646
but he secretly gifts people
items they've lost

31
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:34,563
without telling.

32
00:01:37,232 --> 00:01:38,692
Okay, so…

33
00:01:38,776 --> 00:01:40,361
you'll do it, right?

34
00:01:40,444 --> 00:01:42,279
My goodness.

35
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:44,114
Gosh. It's such a difficult choice.

36
00:01:44,198 --> 00:01:45,866
Should I do it?

37
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,202
Goodness.

38
00:01:48,952 --> 00:01:51,747
You both want me to accept,
so I can't refuse.

39
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,123
What do I do?

40
00:01:53,207 --> 00:01:54,583
So will you do it or not?

41
00:01:56,669 --> 00:01:57,628
I'll give it a try.

42
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,214
Okay.

43
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:02,174
Here. Have some tea.

44
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,886
There's no going back.

45
00:02:09,556 --> 00:02:10,557
It's hot.

46
00:02:14,853 --> 00:02:15,979
What did he want?

47
00:02:16,063 --> 00:02:17,523
What was it?

48
00:02:17,606 --> 00:02:19,441
Why did he want to see you?

49
00:02:19,525 --> 00:02:20,567
Well…

50
00:02:20,651 --> 00:02:23,695
- You did something wrong, didn't you?
- Stop that, will you?

51
00:02:23,779 --> 00:02:25,906
They didn't even give her a second reward.

52
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:28,117
Just what in the world did you do wrong?

53
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,785
Why would he ask to see you?

54
00:02:29,868 --> 00:02:32,621
Good grief.

55
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,456
Just a moment.

56
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,374
- What?
- Why?

57
00:02:37,918 --> 00:02:38,752
What happened?

58
00:02:38,836 --> 00:02:41,088
Something happened. I'm sure of it.

59
00:02:42,005 --> 00:02:43,215
You're really a civil servant?

60
00:02:43,298 --> 00:02:45,926
No, not yet.

61
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:47,511
- Cheers.
- The special position.

62
00:02:47,594 --> 00:02:50,389
It's, like, a civil servant.
And you're an office aide.

63
00:02:50,931 --> 00:02:52,349
Like a semi-public servant?

64
00:02:52,433 --> 00:02:54,810
So I was wondering…

65
00:02:54,893 --> 00:02:58,188
- Yeah?
- Can you help me do my makeup tomorrow?

66
00:03:02,484 --> 00:03:04,111
What are you doing?

67
00:03:04,194 --> 00:03:05,112
What is this?

68
00:03:07,156 --> 00:03:09,450
This prosecutor, Mr. Gye. Do you like him?

69
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:12,536
No! No way!

70
00:03:12,619 --> 00:03:14,121
It's not that.

71
00:03:14,204 --> 00:03:17,332
I'm much older
than the prosecutor, you know.

72
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:18,876
- You?
- Me.

73
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,253
Not me at night, but me during the day.

74
00:03:21,336 --> 00:03:24,173
The changed me.

75
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:27,217
The changed you. Okay.

76
00:03:27,301 --> 00:03:30,679
Mr. Gye could feel a little uncomfortable.

77
00:03:30,763 --> 00:03:32,097
Right, he could.

78
00:03:32,181 --> 00:03:34,224
Also for me…

79
00:03:35,434 --> 00:03:37,436
It's a bit uncomfortable. That's why.

80
00:03:40,898 --> 00:03:42,107
Yeah, sure.

81
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:45,194
After the sun rises and you change,

82
00:03:45,277 --> 00:03:46,862
I'll give it a try.

83
00:03:46,945 --> 00:03:47,780
Okay.

84
00:03:47,863 --> 00:03:50,949
Still, congratulations!
I can't believe it!

85
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:53,410
Great job, Mi-jin!

86
00:03:53,494 --> 00:03:55,788
Do I get to see your real skills?

87
00:04:00,793 --> 00:04:01,835
What are you doing?

88
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:03,879
I still can't get used to it.

89
00:04:07,758 --> 00:04:09,051
Come on, Ga-yeong.

90
00:04:09,134 --> 00:04:10,761
Yes, ma'am.

91
00:04:29,446 --> 00:04:31,406
Smile for me. Just like that.

92
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,209
Lift your head.

93
00:04:47,714 --> 00:04:50,092
You really are
a good beauty content creator.

94
00:04:51,176 --> 00:04:52,970
Is old lady makeup that different?

95
00:04:53,846 --> 00:04:56,557
The more you age,
we have to focus on your skin tone.

96
00:04:59,268 --> 00:05:00,269
Yeah.

97
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:02,688
Using colors to contour
and blushers for shine

98
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:04,940
as if you're in your twenties can look…

99
00:05:05,023 --> 00:05:06,608
It makes you look out of style.

100
00:05:08,986 --> 00:05:09,987
Maybe a little more?

101
00:05:12,197 --> 00:05:14,157
But if this were a miracle,

102
00:05:14,241 --> 00:05:15,701
time would usually stop

103
00:05:15,784 --> 00:05:17,077
or go to the past or future.

104
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,537
But why did this happen?

105
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,454
Damn it.

106
00:05:21,206 --> 00:05:22,332
What if it's a curse?

107
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,168
- A curse?
- You could've become younger.

108
00:05:25,252 --> 00:05:27,504
But you aged. This is ridiculous.

109
00:05:30,549 --> 00:05:32,801
Instead of helping the cat,
did you abuse it?

110
00:05:34,052 --> 00:05:37,681
I may not be kind,
but I don't do bad things. You know that.

111
00:05:38,765 --> 00:05:39,725
I do.

112
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:42,269
Okay. Forget it.

113
00:05:43,395 --> 00:05:46,481
Seeing as how everything
is playing out nicely,

114
00:05:46,565 --> 00:05:48,525
maybe this is for the best.

115
00:05:50,235 --> 00:05:51,862
Since it's turned out like this,

116
00:05:51,945 --> 00:05:53,864
I'm going to keep at it until the end.

117
00:05:53,947 --> 00:05:55,282
What happens then, ma'am?

118
00:05:56,158 --> 00:05:57,618
- I'll kill you.
- What happens?

119
00:06:00,746 --> 00:06:03,874
My twenties were full of failures,
but if I were to go back,

120
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:07,294
I think I can start over again.

121
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,797
Ga-yeong.

122
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:14,092
I've worked so hard

123
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:16,762
but never achieved anything.

124
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:20,015
So this time,

125
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:22,434
I want to see.

126
00:06:23,894 --> 00:06:25,395
If I do my best,

127
00:06:27,022 --> 00:06:28,649
I want to see how well I can do.

128
00:06:33,111 --> 00:06:34,237
You really are Mi-jin.

129
00:06:35,447 --> 00:06:37,074
I told you I was.

130
00:06:37,157 --> 00:06:38,950
- Sorry.
- It is you!

131
00:06:42,412 --> 00:06:45,123
I'll do my best to support you.

132
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,883
Unbelievable!

133
00:07:04,977 --> 00:07:08,772
I know how uncomfortable you are
working with older people.

134
00:07:10,774 --> 00:07:13,694
Since it's come to this,
the best is to have her quit on her own.

135
00:07:14,945 --> 00:07:17,781
There are no applicants,
and you saw the deputy chief.

136
00:07:17,864 --> 00:07:19,366
If she quits on her own,

137
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:22,494
do you really think
he'd hire someone older?

138
00:07:24,705 --> 00:07:26,581
<i>Honestly, she's past her prime.</i>

139
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:28,458
<i>She lacks stamina
and can't communicate.</i>

140
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:30,794
<i>She can try,
but she'll last a month at best.</i>

141
00:07:30,877 --> 00:07:33,296
<i>No, if you put your mind to it
and pressure her,</i>

142
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,631
<i>she won't last a week.</i>

143
00:07:34,715 --> 00:07:38,593
How many young and energetic
office assistants have worked with you?

144
00:07:38,677 --> 00:07:40,971
At least three or four quit on their own.

145
00:07:41,054 --> 00:07:42,347
You have a talent for it.

146
00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:47,853
I'm saying there's still hope.

147
00:08:20,302 --> 00:08:23,305
I promise to do my best to support you.

148
00:08:27,851 --> 00:08:29,227
Okay, I look forward to it.

149
00:08:33,065 --> 00:08:34,566
Thank you, sir.

150
00:08:41,448 --> 00:08:43,116
- You can let go.
- Right.

151
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,388
Ms. Lim?

152
00:09:05,472 --> 00:09:06,640
Yes, sir!

153
00:09:07,808 --> 00:09:09,476
- Could I have a moment?
- Yes, sir.

154
00:09:11,436 --> 00:09:14,481
Organize these legal precedents
into documents before noon.

155
00:09:15,107 --> 00:09:16,108
Yes, sir.

156
00:09:21,696 --> 00:09:24,533
You can't scan them.
You have to type them by hand.

157
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,496
- All of these?
- Of course.

158
00:09:30,413 --> 00:09:31,748
Yes, sir.

159
00:09:36,628 --> 00:09:40,340
That'll be tough even if you can type
1,000 words per minute.

160
00:09:45,053 --> 00:09:46,346
Don't be so obvious.

161
00:10:10,745 --> 00:10:14,416
PART-TIME EXPERIENCE AS PAID CHATTER
CAN TYPE 1,000 WPM ON AVERAGE

162
00:10:16,751 --> 00:10:18,587
Okay, let's work
and get paid on the same day!

163
00:10:28,847 --> 00:10:30,098
No. No way!

164
00:10:39,983 --> 00:10:40,942
It's all done.

165
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:42,944
Already?

166
00:10:43,028 --> 00:10:45,655
You said to finish before noon, so I did.

167
00:10:50,744 --> 00:10:53,288
Check to see if she did this right.

168
00:10:57,417 --> 00:10:58,543
All of these?

169
00:11:00,503 --> 00:11:01,504
Yes.

170
00:11:27,864 --> 00:11:31,451
It took her two hours to type them
and over four hours for you to check.

171
00:11:31,534 --> 00:11:33,370
Isn't that a big drop in efficiency?

172
00:11:33,453 --> 00:11:35,997
Four hours, my foot.
I'm not even halfway done.

173
00:11:36,081 --> 00:11:37,415
You know how hard this is?

174
00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:39,793
If you can't see up close,
wear glasses then!

175
00:11:39,876 --> 00:11:42,170
It's taking forever
because you're reading so slowly.

176
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:45,382
- Any spelling errors?
- Spelling errors?

177
00:11:46,007 --> 00:11:48,051
She didn't even miss a single space.

178
00:11:48,593 --> 00:11:49,803
I mean…

179
00:11:49,886 --> 00:11:51,221
did she work as a typist?

180
00:11:51,304 --> 00:11:53,014
You should've pressured her more.

181
00:11:53,098 --> 00:11:55,016
More how?

182
00:11:55,725 --> 00:11:57,394
Have some coffee as you work.

183
00:11:57,477 --> 00:11:58,353
Coffee…

184
00:11:59,646 --> 00:12:00,480
Thank you.

185
00:12:06,027 --> 00:12:06,945
Taste it for me.

186
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:11,950
Organize our accounting records in Excel.

187
00:12:12,033 --> 00:12:15,078
Attach the necessary quarterly statements
and the annual plan

188
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:16,663
and save them to the shared folders.

189
00:12:17,747 --> 00:12:19,708
So you're saying you want me

190
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,127
to create Excel spreadsheets for this?

191
00:12:22,752 --> 00:12:23,586
Yes.

192
00:12:24,087 --> 00:12:26,965
Using functions is hard,
so I'm sure you won't know.

193
00:12:30,802 --> 00:12:32,220
If you can't do it--

194
00:12:32,303 --> 00:12:35,724
I'll classify the supplies
by their codes and set it up

195
00:12:35,807 --> 00:12:38,351
so it extracts characters
with the MID function.

196
00:12:38,435 --> 00:12:40,770
Combined with the FIND function,
if you separate the text,

197
00:12:40,854 --> 00:12:43,732
you could check by number,
manufacturer, and quantity.

198
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:47,485
So if I start with cell C…

199
00:12:52,365 --> 00:12:57,620
Mid, parenthesis, C5, find, parenthesis,
slash in quotes, C5, close parenthesis.

200
00:12:57,704 --> 00:13:00,790
Plus one, find, parenthesis,
slash in quotes, C5, find.

201
00:13:00,874 --> 00:13:04,294
Parenthesis, slash, C5, close parenthesis,
plus one, close parenthesis, minus find.

202
00:13:04,377 --> 00:13:08,214
Slash, C5 in parenthesis,
minus one, close parenthesis.

203
00:13:11,885 --> 00:13:14,304
I'll use three FIND functions

204
00:13:14,387 --> 00:13:17,599
and make a formula that will manage
the supplies efficiently.

205
00:13:18,767 --> 00:13:20,894
Okay, not bad.

206
00:13:22,562 --> 00:13:24,189
Yes, not bad.

207
00:13:37,786 --> 00:13:40,121
2022 FIRST QUARTER FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

208
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,836
Compared to every office assistant
I've seen so far,

209
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,631
this quality of work is far superior and…

210
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:54,511
Just in case,

211
00:13:55,178 --> 00:13:56,763
I made it into a program.

212
00:13:56,846 --> 00:13:58,139
You have programming skills?

213
00:13:58,723 --> 00:14:00,683
Yes, I studied coding for a while.

214
00:14:02,894 --> 00:14:04,979
I put it in the shared folder.

215
00:14:05,063 --> 00:14:06,314
If you could take a look…

216
00:14:18,701 --> 00:14:20,412
What are we going to do now?

217
00:14:21,788 --> 00:14:23,998
- What?
- What are we going to do now?

218
00:14:24,082 --> 00:14:25,250
Now!

219
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:28,586
She can master computer skills effort,

220
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,630
but she can't keep up with the youth!

221
00:14:30,713 --> 00:14:31,631
What did you say?

222
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,134
She can't keep up with the youth!

223
00:14:34,217 --> 00:14:35,218
Allow me

224
00:14:35,969 --> 00:14:37,387
to show you!

225
00:15:18,303 --> 00:15:19,304
Thank you for today.

226
00:15:19,387 --> 00:15:20,430
I'll be going now.

227
00:15:21,306 --> 00:15:22,140
Before you go…

228
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,435
We'd like to order dinner.

229
00:15:26,603 --> 00:15:27,770
Okay, I'll order it.

230
00:15:27,854 --> 00:15:29,981
- Let's have something simple.
- What?

231
00:15:30,064 --> 00:15:31,274
Delivery food is too heavy.

232
00:15:31,733 --> 00:15:33,318
- I don't want that.
- Me neither.

233
00:15:33,401 --> 00:15:35,862
Can you buy us something from around here?

234
00:15:37,947 --> 00:15:39,491
Okay, I'll be back soon.

235
00:15:39,574 --> 00:15:42,160
How about something simple
from a nearby cafe?

236
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:46,789
A medium-well steak.
Don't overcook the asparagus.

237
00:15:46,873 --> 00:15:48,124
It should have a crunch.

238
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,834
Mr. Gye's sensitive to spices,

239
00:15:49,918 --> 00:15:51,920
so no garlic flakes or black pepper.

240
00:15:52,003 --> 00:15:53,963
Ask the chef directly
to make the sauce.

241
00:15:54,047 --> 00:15:56,257
- A <i>glace de viande.</i>
- The what?

242
00:15:56,341 --> 00:15:57,842
<i>Glace de viande.</i>

243
00:15:57,926 --> 00:15:59,594
I see. "<i>Glace de viande.</i>"

244
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,304
Okay.

245
00:16:03,097 --> 00:16:05,558
I want a burger on honey grain
with a lot of lettuce,

246
00:16:05,642 --> 00:16:07,477
thinly cut tomatoes,
and cooked onions.

247
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,521
Make sure the olives
and pickles don't fall out.

248
00:16:09,604 --> 00:16:12,440
Also, I'm vegan,
so no bacon and add cheese.

249
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:15,443
- Okay.
- For drinks…

250
00:16:15,527 --> 00:16:17,278
- There's more?
- I'm just getting started.

251
00:16:19,739 --> 00:16:21,699
I want a latte with two shots
but not too hot.

252
00:16:21,783 --> 00:16:23,535
Add hazelnut and vanilla syrup.

253
00:16:23,618 --> 00:16:25,537
I want milk foam instead of whipped cream.

254
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,122
Add a mocha drizzle
and the whipped cream too.

255
00:16:28,206 --> 00:16:29,749
A lot of chocolate chips.

256
00:16:29,832 --> 00:16:30,667
What? A lot!

257
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,001
- A lot. What?
- A lot.

258
00:16:32,085 --> 00:16:33,253
- Yes, a lot.
- Right.

259
00:16:33,336 --> 00:16:36,047
Also, I'm on a diet,
so make it low-fat milk and decaf.

260
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,966
<i>Don't forget it</i>

261
00:16:38,049 --> 00:16:39,467
I'll be right back!

262
00:16:46,724 --> 00:16:48,643
Yes!

263
00:16:49,394 --> 00:16:50,895
We did it!

264
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:52,647
Don't go overboard.

265
00:16:54,941 --> 00:16:56,317
Man, I'm late now.

266
00:16:56,401 --> 00:16:57,777
TAKEOUT, PICK-UP AVAILABLE

267
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,237
Number 82.

268
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,321
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

269
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,243
TAKEOUT, PICK-UP COMPLETE

270
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:12,041
It won't be easy
to find a place for my order.

271
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,168
Not to mention, it's the dinner rush.

272
00:17:14,252 --> 00:17:16,045
After waiting in line,

273
00:17:16,129 --> 00:17:17,463
it'll already be sold out.

274
00:17:19,757 --> 00:17:20,592
My gosh!

275
00:17:22,594 --> 00:17:25,680
The layered latte is seasonal drink,
so I got a free gift too.

276
00:17:25,763 --> 00:17:26,848
- You did?
- Here.

277
00:17:26,931 --> 00:17:28,308
I'll be going now.

278
00:17:30,143 --> 00:17:31,269
Wait, hold on.

279
00:17:33,187 --> 00:17:35,189
Is this…

280
00:17:35,273 --> 00:17:36,649
Is this possible?

281
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,319
What just happened?

282
00:17:39,402 --> 00:17:41,279
This is impossible.

283
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,074
Isn't that Ko Won?

284
00:17:45,158 --> 00:17:46,075
- It's not.
- Ko Won!

285
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:47,368
- Ko Won!
- He's so handsome!

286
00:17:48,077 --> 00:17:49,621
Ko Won, over here!

287
00:17:49,704 --> 00:17:50,663
Ko Won!

288
00:17:52,123 --> 00:17:53,041
Hey, Ko Won!

289
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,335
This is insane!

290
00:17:57,462 --> 00:17:58,379
Ko Won!

291
00:18:01,424 --> 00:18:02,258
Hey, Ko Won!

292
00:18:18,858 --> 00:18:20,109
Ma'am!

293
00:18:28,117 --> 00:18:29,118
Ma'am!

294
00:18:53,101 --> 00:18:53,935
Ma'am…

295
00:19:28,845 --> 00:19:30,388
I swear it was her though.

296
00:19:49,073 --> 00:19:50,116
Goodness.

297
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:52,452
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

298
00:19:52,535 --> 00:19:53,995
You look like death.

299
00:19:54,579 --> 00:19:55,413
You're not okay.

300
00:19:56,164 --> 00:19:57,498
- Let me see.
- Mom.

301
00:19:57,582 --> 00:19:59,625
- Forget it. It's fine.
- Stay still.

302
00:19:59,709 --> 00:20:01,085
Mom!

303
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:03,171
- Cramp!
- Is it a cramp?

304
00:20:03,254 --> 00:20:05,631
- Cramp!
- Is it a cramp?

305
00:20:07,508 --> 00:20:08,843
Goodness.

306
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,721
Your legs are all swollen.

307
00:20:12,555 --> 00:20:13,639
Lightly, Mom.

308
00:20:15,016 --> 00:20:16,309
Do you just run around all day?

309
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:20,480
Still, it's nice.

310
00:20:20,563 --> 00:20:21,564
What?

311
00:20:22,148 --> 00:20:23,691
Now that I'm working,

312
00:20:25,026 --> 00:20:26,819
it feels so nice.

313
00:20:29,322 --> 00:20:31,991
I love it so much but…

314
00:20:32,658 --> 00:20:36,162
<i>I'm sad since I can't work
in my normal appearance.</i>

315
00:20:38,331 --> 00:20:40,750
Why did you stop in the middle? But what?

316
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:42,835
It's nothing.

317
00:20:43,711 --> 00:20:45,797
Forget it. It's fine.

318
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,800
Mom, with my first paycheck,
what should I get you and Dad?

319
00:20:48,883 --> 00:20:50,426
I've always wanted to do that.

320
00:20:50,885 --> 00:20:52,637
I'll buy you two whatever you want.

321
00:20:54,055 --> 00:20:55,807
It's not like we paid for your studies.

322
00:20:56,641 --> 00:20:59,852
You earned money on your own
to pay for your studies.

323
00:20:59,936 --> 00:21:02,897
Don't waste your money and save it.

324
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,442
Spending it on you two isn't a waste.

325
00:21:06,526 --> 00:21:09,403
Tell me. Do you want new clothes?

326
00:21:10,446 --> 00:21:11,656
A bag?

327
00:21:11,739 --> 00:21:14,158
Forget it. I don't need anything.

328
00:21:14,242 --> 00:21:17,620
Get your dad
some fur-lined boots for winter.

329
00:21:17,703 --> 00:21:20,248
They're so worn out
I'm scared he might slip and fall

330
00:21:20,331 --> 00:21:21,541
at the slaughterhouse.

331
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:23,960
Jeez.

332
00:21:24,961 --> 00:21:27,046
I should've bought those a long time ago.

333
00:21:27,129 --> 00:21:31,717
If you buy those for him,
he'd wear them until his feet got sore.

334
00:21:35,513 --> 00:21:36,597
Okay, give me your legs.

335
00:21:36,681 --> 00:21:38,307
No. Let me do it for you, Mom.

336
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:39,892
Wow.

337
00:21:39,976 --> 00:21:41,853
- Your fingers won't work.
- Nope.

338
00:21:41,936 --> 00:21:42,937
- I'm made of rock.
- Yeah.

339
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,272
Lie down.

340
00:21:45,523 --> 00:21:47,233
All right. Let's switch legs.

341
00:21:47,316 --> 00:21:48,359
Here we go.

342
00:21:49,235 --> 00:21:51,529
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

343
00:21:52,154 --> 00:21:53,364
You want me to go where?

344
00:21:54,198 --> 00:21:55,116
Obongsan Mountain.

345
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:58,369
Why do I have to go to Obongsan right now?

346
00:21:58,452 --> 00:22:00,871
The summons we sent
kept returning, so I checked.

347
00:22:01,455 --> 00:22:04,041
The victim moved into the mountains
to live as a recluse.

348
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,668
- So that mountain is--
- Obongsan.

349
00:22:07,003 --> 00:22:09,005
Give this to him in person.

350
00:22:09,088 --> 00:22:10,590
Having him appear would be best.

351
00:22:10,673 --> 00:22:12,091
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

352
00:22:12,174 --> 00:22:14,093
But it's hard to go dressed like this.

353
00:22:14,885 --> 00:22:18,514
You'll have to leave now
to be back before lunch.

354
00:22:18,598 --> 00:22:19,890
Lunch? Not dinner?

355
00:22:19,974 --> 00:22:20,891
Yes.

356
00:22:21,684 --> 00:22:23,978
- I guess it'd be tough due to your age--
- No!

357
00:22:25,021 --> 00:22:26,564
I'll be back soon.

358
00:22:35,406 --> 00:22:36,616
Gosh.

359
00:22:37,366 --> 00:22:39,076
It's impossible to do in a day.

360
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,162
A round trip to Obongsan Mountain.

361
00:22:41,245 --> 00:22:42,246
You're the best.

362
00:22:42,872 --> 00:22:44,415
You're amazing, Mr. Gye.

363
00:22:44,957 --> 00:22:47,627
You sure have a talent
for working people to the bone…

364
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,424
I wonder if she'll make it back alive.

365
00:23:04,852 --> 00:23:07,355
How did they know
I wasn't built for hiking?

366
00:23:19,992 --> 00:23:21,661
PART-TIME EXPERIENCE AT CLIMBING GYM

367
00:23:21,744 --> 00:23:24,914
ROCK CLIMBING LEVEL 10

368
00:23:49,897 --> 00:23:51,899
I'm so glad I made it on time.

369
00:23:53,442 --> 00:23:55,986
Did you have lunch?
Do you want some dumplings?

370
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,905
It's okay. I ate with him.

371
00:23:58,781 --> 00:23:59,782
Him?

372
00:23:59,865 --> 00:24:02,451
He promised to appear in court next week.

373
00:24:16,382 --> 00:24:18,551
Who in the world is she?

374
00:24:22,096 --> 00:24:24,098
I'm sure she was the same person.

375
00:24:27,601 --> 00:24:28,728
What is this?

376
00:24:29,895 --> 00:24:31,063
Is it makeup?

377
00:24:31,731 --> 00:24:34,024
But it's so real.

378
00:24:36,944 --> 00:24:37,987
Ma'am!

379
00:24:59,091 --> 00:25:00,509
MISSING CAT

380
00:25:01,343 --> 00:25:02,428
Ma'am?

381
00:25:04,138 --> 00:25:05,514
Excuse me.

382
00:25:05,598 --> 00:25:07,933
I'm looking for a cat
that looks like this.

383
00:25:09,143 --> 00:25:10,144
This isn't the same one.

384
00:25:11,687 --> 00:25:13,773
If a similar cat comes in by chance,

385
00:25:13,856 --> 00:25:15,065
could you please call?

386
00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:17,359
- Please call.
- Okay.

387
00:25:24,116 --> 00:25:30,539
MISSING CAT
REWARD 300,000 WON

388
00:25:30,623 --> 00:25:32,458
- Fentanyl?
- Yes.

389
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:34,418
Traces of it were found in the blood.

390
00:25:37,755 --> 00:25:40,633
If it's fentanyl,
it could be a drug patch.

391
00:25:40,716 --> 00:25:44,053
They say the drugs he was on
are new ones popular at clubs.

392
00:25:44,136 --> 00:25:45,846
<i>It's a modified drug patch.</i>

393
00:25:47,348 --> 00:25:49,934
Fentanyl was found
in Kang Gyeong-hui's corpse.

394
00:25:50,643 --> 00:25:52,019
But she had no illnesses.

395
00:25:52,102 --> 00:25:53,187
Right.

396
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:56,982
Wait, does that mean someone injected her?

397
00:25:57,066 --> 00:25:58,984
- Mom…
- Or did she inject herself?

398
00:26:00,277 --> 00:26:02,029
Mom…

399
00:26:03,531 --> 00:26:07,034
You said the detective in charge
of the case back then had retired.

400
00:26:07,117 --> 00:26:08,911
Well, it happened a long time ago.

401
00:26:08,994 --> 00:26:10,162
So I'm sure he's retired.

402
00:26:10,746 --> 00:26:12,498
Could I get his name and number?

403
00:26:12,581 --> 00:26:14,124
Sure, I'll look into it.

404
00:26:24,176 --> 00:26:25,177
<i>Six, four, three, eight.</i>

405
00:26:27,346 --> 00:26:28,806
<i>Six, four, three, eight. Was it him?</i>

406
00:26:32,518 --> 00:26:36,480
<i>If it was him, why would he make such
a risky move and return to the scene?</i>

407
00:26:38,816 --> 00:26:39,942
<i>For what reason?</i>

408
00:26:43,529 --> 00:26:44,905
<i>He's looking for something.</i>

409
00:26:45,573 --> 00:26:47,199
<i>Or someone.</i>

410
00:26:48,033 --> 00:26:49,326
<i>What could it be?</i>

411
00:26:52,705 --> 00:26:54,874
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

412
00:27:03,215 --> 00:27:04,300
<i>Are you free today?</i>

413
00:27:16,854 --> 00:27:18,606
Are you avoiding me on purpose?

414
00:27:23,569 --> 00:27:24,570
It's been a while.

415
00:27:26,947 --> 00:27:28,574
I heard you got a big case.

416
00:27:29,158 --> 00:27:33,662
Deal with the crazy acid thrower
and help calm the chief down quick.

417
00:27:34,455 --> 00:27:37,041
You have a lot
of unnecessary interest in me.

418
00:27:37,124 --> 00:27:39,585
I've had a crush on you. Didn't you know?

419
00:27:40,294 --> 00:27:43,130
I've been longing for you since college.

420
00:27:43,756 --> 00:27:46,634
Stop giving me so much attention.
It's not worth anything.

421
00:27:48,969 --> 00:27:52,181
I'm not someone who bases
their feelings for someone on worth.

422
00:27:52,806 --> 00:27:54,058
SEOHAN MUTILATION MURDER CASE

423
00:27:54,808 --> 00:27:56,602
The autopsy report's still not out?

424
00:28:01,482 --> 00:28:03,317
Stay away from my case!

425
00:28:06,737 --> 00:28:07,571
Okay?

426
00:28:09,031 --> 00:28:11,700
You better stay away from my case.

427
00:28:11,784 --> 00:28:13,786
Weren't you jealous that I got a big case?

428
00:28:14,286 --> 00:28:15,996
Take mine and give me yours.

429
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,082
I don't know why you're here,

430
00:28:18,165 --> 00:28:21,543
but while you were on TV,
swarmed by reporters at Seoul Central…

431
00:28:22,795 --> 00:28:25,297
I spent three years here
dealing with greenhouse arson,

432
00:28:25,381 --> 00:28:27,174
attempted murder with pesticides,

433
00:28:27,258 --> 00:28:28,384
low-stakes gambling,

434
00:28:28,467 --> 00:28:31,053
senior center assaults, antler theft,
and rotating savings fraud!

435
00:28:32,429 --> 00:28:35,099
This is the first real case I've ever had.

436
00:28:35,808 --> 00:28:36,809
Don't touch it.

437
00:28:36,892 --> 00:28:38,686
Yeah, you've worked hard.

438
00:28:39,311 --> 00:28:41,563
Well, I was thinking about
how to handle this.

439
00:28:41,647 --> 00:28:43,524
I just got a firearm-related death case.

440
00:28:43,607 --> 00:28:46,026
When? Where? And the victim?

441
00:28:47,111 --> 00:28:48,445
The victim…

442
00:28:50,698 --> 00:28:51,615
is a boar.

443
00:28:51,699 --> 00:28:52,533
Yeah.

444
00:28:54,743 --> 00:28:55,577
Damn it.

445
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:15,014
You're the senior intern
who was assigned to Mr. Gye, right?

446
00:29:16,765 --> 00:29:17,599
Yes.

447
00:29:18,142 --> 00:29:19,852
Be careful of him.

448
00:29:20,936 --> 00:29:21,979
He may not look it,

449
00:29:22,062 --> 00:29:25,357
but he's much more
of a jerk than you think.

450
00:29:30,738 --> 00:29:33,282
Me and my big mouth. Why did I laugh?

451
00:29:34,908 --> 00:29:35,743
Jeez.

452
00:29:51,425 --> 00:29:52,593
Hello?

453
00:29:52,676 --> 00:29:54,511
Why haven't you texted me back?

454
00:29:54,595 --> 00:29:57,389
Sorry, I work during the day.

455
00:29:57,473 --> 00:29:59,516
It's hard for me to check on time.

456
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,518
What? I can't hear you. Where are you?

457
00:30:02,978 --> 00:30:04,271
Well,

458
00:30:04,355 --> 00:30:07,900
I don't get… service… here.

459
00:30:11,945 --> 00:30:13,697
I'd like to see you today.

460
00:30:13,781 --> 00:30:16,909
I see. I can't during the day,
but I could see you tonight.

461
00:30:17,534 --> 00:30:19,328
Let's meet
at that coffee shop from before.

462
00:30:20,245 --> 00:30:21,121
From before when?

463
00:30:21,205 --> 00:30:22,539
What's wrong with her voice?

464
00:30:22,623 --> 00:30:25,042
Is this Lee Mi-jin?

465
00:30:27,002 --> 00:30:28,253
Yes, it's me.

466
00:30:29,296 --> 00:30:30,631
Remember where you were scammed?

467
00:30:30,714 --> 00:30:32,257
Yes, that place.

468
00:30:32,341 --> 00:30:33,675
Okay, goodbye.

469
00:30:55,155 --> 00:30:56,156
Are you okay?

470
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:08,585
Thanks for bringing me my stuff.

471
00:31:08,669 --> 00:31:10,045
How have you been?

472
00:31:10,129 --> 00:31:11,255
Just fine.

473
00:31:11,338 --> 00:31:13,924
It's so nice to not see Gye Ji-ung.

474
00:31:14,007 --> 00:31:15,551
Whenever I think about that jerk--

475
00:31:15,634 --> 00:31:17,386
- Still.
- Crazy bastard.

476
00:31:17,469 --> 00:31:19,012
He continues to be handsome.

477
00:31:19,096 --> 00:31:21,306
Don't be fooled by his appearance.

478
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:22,975
That bastard's insane.

479
00:31:30,858 --> 00:31:31,733
Goodness.

480
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,319
Why?

481
00:31:34,403 --> 00:31:36,280
Why do I have to be here and do this?

482
00:31:36,363 --> 00:31:37,656
Why?

483
00:31:41,577 --> 00:31:42,703
Damn it.

484
00:31:49,293 --> 00:31:50,252
Hey, lady!

485
00:31:50,335 --> 00:31:52,463
There are no tissues again!

486
00:31:52,546 --> 00:31:54,423
Hurry up and bring some toilet paper.

487
00:31:56,717 --> 00:31:58,552
I said it's urgent!

488
00:31:59,678 --> 00:32:00,971
Hey, lady!

489
00:32:04,016 --> 00:32:04,850
Here you go.

490
00:32:04,933 --> 00:32:06,727
Hurry it up. Damn it.

491
00:32:26,705 --> 00:32:27,581
Damn it.

492
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:37,090
Goodness, I'm sorry.

493
00:32:37,591 --> 00:32:39,468
I thought there was a fire.

494
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:41,303
Are you okay, miss?

495
00:32:41,386 --> 00:32:43,138
Are you insane, lady?

496
00:32:43,222 --> 00:32:44,556
Are you crazy? Hey--

497
00:32:45,933 --> 00:32:48,352
Your face is all wet. My goodness!

498
00:32:48,435 --> 00:32:49,895
That's a rag!

499
00:32:50,771 --> 00:32:51,730
Miss.

500
00:32:51,813 --> 00:32:55,400
Do you know how much the fine is
for smoking in a non-smoking area?

501
00:32:55,901 --> 00:32:56,818
You must be rich.

502
00:32:56,902 --> 00:32:58,362
- I'm sorry.
- Goodness.

503
00:32:58,445 --> 00:33:00,280
Look at how wet you are.

504
00:33:01,114 --> 00:33:02,533
Help me!

505
00:33:02,616 --> 00:33:04,117
Someone help me!

506
00:33:04,826 --> 00:33:06,787
I'm wiping her face. What's with her?

507
00:33:08,497 --> 00:33:09,790
Serves you right.

508
00:33:12,084 --> 00:33:15,212
The drug patch Ji Dong-kwon used
had traces of fentanyl, right?

509
00:33:15,295 --> 00:33:16,255
Probably.

510
00:33:16,755 --> 00:33:20,259
After dealing with drug offenders,
I even look at their brain synapses now.

511
00:33:20,342 --> 00:33:22,594
Ji Dong-kwon has four
previous drug convictions,

512
00:33:22,678 --> 00:33:24,263
which means he's serious about drugs.

513
00:33:24,346 --> 00:33:27,224
At that stage, it's common
to not act consistently.

514
00:33:28,058 --> 00:33:29,226
Consistently?

515
00:33:30,018 --> 00:33:33,063
It's like speeding at 200 km/h
while high on drugs,

516
00:33:33,146 --> 00:33:34,523
causing an eight-car pile-up,

517
00:33:34,606 --> 00:33:37,609
stealing a car in the chaos,
and ramming it into a cop car.

518
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:39,820
A literal ticking time bomb.

519
00:33:42,114 --> 00:33:45,033
But he left behind evidence
along every step of the way.

520
00:33:48,161 --> 00:33:50,414
Shouldn't you at least buy
the acid in person?

521
00:33:50,497 --> 00:33:51,665
He buys his drugs in person.

522
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:53,917
That's true.

523
00:33:54,418 --> 00:33:57,462
There's no need to buy it online
and leave evidence.

524
00:33:58,005 --> 00:34:00,882
- Should I check his illegal account again?
- Just a moment.

525
00:34:00,966 --> 00:34:04,553
He purchased sulfuric acid
online on the 3rd at 2:00 a.m.

526
00:34:05,178 --> 00:34:07,723
He signed up for Ko Won's fan club
and checked his schedule.

527
00:34:07,806 --> 00:34:11,143
He stalked him and waited by his house,
but when that didn't work,

528
00:34:11,226 --> 00:34:14,605
he decided to take him out on a day
when all the reporters were there?

529
00:34:15,939 --> 00:34:17,149
Does that make sense?

530
00:34:17,858 --> 00:34:19,192
No, it doesn't.

531
00:34:19,276 --> 00:34:22,654
Look into all transactions related
to fentanyl in Seohan City.

532
00:34:22,738 --> 00:34:25,198
It's new,
so it hasn't been out for that long.

533
00:34:25,282 --> 00:34:28,076
Maybe about a year?

534
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,747
That's around the same time
when Ji Dong-kwon moved here. Interesting.

535
00:34:32,581 --> 00:34:33,582
I'll look right into it.

536
00:34:34,249 --> 00:34:36,918
Damn it.
Why does he suddenly want to meet?

537
00:34:37,002 --> 00:34:39,254
Jeez, it's bothering me so much.

538
00:34:39,338 --> 00:34:40,380
It seems you have plans.

539
00:34:40,464 --> 00:34:41,632
What?

540
00:34:42,257 --> 00:34:43,175
Why are you so scared?

541
00:34:44,926 --> 00:34:46,720
Yes, to be honest…

542
00:34:46,803 --> 00:34:48,805
I have a weak heart.

543
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:52,684
Could you look for an SUV registered
in Seohan City with the number 6438?

544
00:34:52,768 --> 00:34:54,061
What's the first part?

545
00:34:54,144 --> 00:34:55,437
That's all I know.

546
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,523
I can't find it right away.
I think it'll take a few days.

547
00:34:58,607 --> 00:34:59,441
Okay.

548
00:34:59,524 --> 00:35:01,485
Submit the warrant request and go home.

549
00:35:01,568 --> 00:35:02,861
What?

550
00:35:04,488 --> 00:35:05,656
What is it this time?

551
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:09,785
<i>It'll be so late
when I'm done with all of that.</i>

552
00:35:33,225 --> 00:35:36,019
<i>I'm sorry, but something urgent came up.
I'll be a bit late.</i>

553
00:35:36,103 --> 00:35:37,104
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

554
00:35:38,855 --> 00:35:42,109
Maybe don't do things you need to
apologize for in the first place then.

555
00:35:49,116 --> 00:35:50,075
Hello.

556
00:36:05,173 --> 00:36:07,384
I'm a witness to a murder?

557
00:36:08,593 --> 00:36:10,429
I'm not sure yet.
We're still investigating.

558
00:36:11,388 --> 00:36:13,682
We're not sure
if the victim is still alive.

559
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,477
In any case,
the person I saw was the culprit.

560
00:36:25,777 --> 00:36:26,903
What is this?

561
00:36:27,821 --> 00:36:30,824
Could you give me a few items
that are good for self-defense?

562
00:36:30,907 --> 00:36:32,701
You've never asked for that before.

563
00:36:33,744 --> 00:36:35,203
I doubt it's for you.

564
00:36:36,413 --> 00:36:37,247
Who's it for?

565
00:36:37,831 --> 00:36:39,207
Someone important.

566
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:41,877
- Your girlfriend?
- More important than a girlfriend.

567
00:36:43,211 --> 00:36:44,337
Be careful with that.

568
00:36:44,421 --> 00:36:45,964
Press the button and it'll zap you.

569
00:36:46,047 --> 00:36:47,174
I'll take this too.

570
00:36:48,258 --> 00:36:50,051
Do you have that too?

571
00:36:50,552 --> 00:36:52,345
Have these with you just in case.

572
00:36:52,429 --> 00:36:55,807
I'll call the cops if I'm in danger.
I don't think I need these.

573
00:36:59,811 --> 00:37:00,896
That scared me.

574
00:37:06,485 --> 00:37:08,403
I arrived 40 minutes ago.

575
00:37:17,746 --> 00:37:19,915
PROSECUTOR GYE JI-UNG

576
00:37:26,838 --> 00:37:28,715
Here are the drinks you ordered.

577
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,471
Thank you.

578
00:37:35,972 --> 00:37:37,808
I saved my number in your shortcuts.

579
00:37:37,891 --> 00:37:40,352
Call me right away
if something dangerous happens.

580
00:37:40,435 --> 00:37:41,937
It doesn't matter when or where.

581
00:37:42,854 --> 00:37:43,855
Okay.

582
00:37:46,566 --> 00:37:48,944
But if I'm a witness,

583
00:37:49,027 --> 00:37:51,446
why haven't the police called me yet?

584
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,156
- I didn't tell them.
- Why not?

585
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,991
- Because of trust.
- You don't trust me?

586
00:37:55,575 --> 00:37:57,285
- I can't trust the police.
- Wait.

587
00:37:58,161 --> 00:37:59,788
What I don't understand is

588
00:37:59,871 --> 00:38:02,749
you're a prosecutor,
but you don't trust law enforcement.

589
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:05,794
What if you came to the station
as a witness, got exposed,

590
00:38:05,877 --> 00:38:06,878
and became a target?

591
00:38:06,962 --> 00:38:08,964
So you should catch the culprit sooner.

592
00:38:09,714 --> 00:38:11,299
Is there anything I can testify to?

593
00:38:11,383 --> 00:38:14,052
I've already reported everything you said.

594
00:38:14,135 --> 00:38:17,848
So even if you get involved,
there's nothing more you can do.

595
00:38:17,931 --> 00:38:19,015
Still.

596
00:38:19,349 --> 00:38:21,810
Getting involved could put you
in danger so listen to me.

597
00:38:23,562 --> 00:38:25,146
What if they come after me?

598
00:38:26,147 --> 00:38:27,357
We need to catch them.

599
00:38:28,024 --> 00:38:30,277
So until then, you can trust me.

600
00:38:41,463 --> 00:38:44,132
Answer when I call. I'll do the same.

601
00:38:45,217 --> 00:38:47,219
Okay. I won't stay out late either.

602
00:38:47,302 --> 00:38:49,221
The sun doesn't stop murderers.

603
00:38:50,597 --> 00:38:52,432
I mean you should always be careful.

604
00:38:53,725 --> 00:38:54,976
Why did you tell me that?

605
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,437
I would've at least been comfortable
if I didn't know.

606
00:38:58,063 --> 00:38:59,147
Ignorance is bliss.

607
00:38:59,231 --> 00:39:01,107
And what if something really happens?

608
00:39:10,617 --> 00:39:11,660
I'll go now.

609
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:20,168
You don't have to get out.

610
00:39:20,252 --> 00:39:21,711
I'll see you to the door.

611
00:39:22,337 --> 00:39:23,755
You don't need to do that.

612
00:39:25,507 --> 00:39:26,341
Go on in.

613
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,261
Thank you.

614
00:40:04,796 --> 00:40:05,880
<i>We need to catch them.</i>

615
00:40:05,964 --> 00:40:07,090
<i>So until then…</i>

616
00:40:09,467 --> 00:40:10,594
you can trust me.

617
00:40:14,014 --> 00:40:16,558
Who said I didn't trust you?

618
00:40:16,641 --> 00:40:17,642
But what do I do?

619
00:40:17,726 --> 00:40:20,353
I don't think I can pick up
during the day.

620
00:40:20,437 --> 00:40:22,272
PROSECUTOR GYE JI-UNG

621
00:40:34,409 --> 00:40:35,243
Hello?

622
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:44,336
Did something happen?

623
00:40:44,419 --> 00:40:45,253
<i>Well…</i>

624
00:40:46,588 --> 00:40:47,839
So the thing is…

625
00:40:48,715 --> 00:40:49,549
<i>Well…</i>

626
00:40:50,508 --> 00:40:52,344
Did you get home safely?

627
00:40:53,762 --> 00:40:55,513
Only call if it's important.

628
00:40:56,139 --> 00:40:57,724
I had something to say too.

629
00:40:58,308 --> 00:41:00,060
What is it? Tell me.

630
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,104
I'll trust you.

631
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,860
I'll trust you, so keep your promise.

632
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,154
Okay.

633
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,379
Damn it!

634
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:36,471
<i>- Do you have that too?
- What?</i>

635
00:41:36,554 --> 00:41:38,056
A GPS tracker.

636
00:41:39,015 --> 00:41:40,892
<i>To track openly? Or secretly?</i>

637
00:41:41,476 --> 00:41:43,019
<i>Something that won't get me caught.</i>

638
00:41:43,103 --> 00:41:43,937
<i>Is it possible?</i>

639
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,188
INSTALLING

640
00:41:52,612 --> 00:41:54,948
Today was so much fun. My goodness.

641
00:41:55,865 --> 00:41:57,617
Right. Today, Ga-yeong had to…

642
00:41:58,326 --> 00:41:59,703
What happened with the cat?

643
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:07,752
Hey, Ga-yeong. Did you find the cat?

644
00:42:07,836 --> 00:42:09,003
MISSING CAT
REWARD 300,000 WON

645
00:42:09,087 --> 00:42:12,173
I went to all the shelters,
but there weren't any similar cats.

646
00:42:12,257 --> 00:42:13,758
Right?

647
00:42:13,842 --> 00:42:16,052
Gosh, you did great. Thanks a lot.

648
00:42:16,136 --> 00:42:18,221
I'll treat you once I get paid.

649
00:42:18,304 --> 00:42:20,056
You're working. It can't be helped.

650
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:23,143
I should work hard
for my suddenly old friend.

651
00:42:23,727 --> 00:42:25,395
<i>By the way, are you doing well at work?</i>

652
00:42:25,478 --> 00:42:27,522
What? Are you worried the work's bad?

653
00:42:27,605 --> 00:42:29,315
It's not the work that worries me.

654
00:42:29,399 --> 00:42:31,651
You've had tons of part-time jobs before.

655
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,738
But this is a little different.

656
00:42:34,821 --> 00:42:36,698
An office aide? A special position, right?

657
00:42:36,781 --> 00:42:37,824
<i>Yeah, so that's why</i>

658
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:40,368
I think it's more fun.

659
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:43,204
It's fun?

660
00:42:43,288 --> 00:42:48,168
<i>Yeah. You know I've seen procedural dramas
from all around the world.</i>

661
00:42:48,251 --> 00:42:49,085
Hey.

662
00:42:49,169 --> 00:42:51,880
TV shows aren't the same as real life.

663
00:42:51,963 --> 00:42:54,048
It's more fun because it's real.

664
00:42:55,842 --> 00:42:56,926
But the thing is

665
00:42:57,886 --> 00:42:58,928
I think…

666
00:43:00,722 --> 00:43:02,599
I've found what I'm good at.

667
00:43:05,977 --> 00:43:08,855
Is that prosecutor good to you though?

668
00:43:09,522 --> 00:43:10,815
Well…

669
00:43:12,901 --> 00:43:13,777
I mean,

670
00:43:14,402 --> 00:43:15,904
I'll tell you later in person.

671
00:43:15,987 --> 00:43:17,822
I have some stuff to tell you.

672
00:43:17,906 --> 00:43:19,282
Mi-jin, come and eat!

673
00:43:19,783 --> 00:43:20,909
Coming!

674
00:43:20,992 --> 00:43:22,368
Hey, Ga-yeong,

675
00:43:22,452 --> 00:43:24,496
send me the cat video when you're done.

676
00:43:24,579 --> 00:43:26,206
Okay, bye!

677
00:43:30,668 --> 00:43:34,214
It's not like she can keep working
like this. What will she do then?

678
00:43:34,964 --> 00:43:37,675
Still, it's a relief to hear
she's having fun.

679
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:41,095
She won't end up getting fired, will she?

680
00:43:42,555 --> 00:43:43,765
Thanks for the meal.

681
00:43:46,518 --> 00:43:47,602
That's nice.

682
00:43:47,685 --> 00:43:49,020
- Soup's good, right?
- Yeah.

683
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,191
What's up, Mi-jin?

684
00:43:53,817 --> 00:43:55,568
You look happy about something.

685
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,113
- Yeah.
- What is it?

686
00:44:02,242 --> 00:44:03,076
I have a job.

687
00:44:04,911 --> 00:44:07,580
Honey, get some water
for our employed daughter.

688
00:44:07,664 --> 00:44:09,582
- Yes, ma'am!
- Dad, it's okay.

689
00:44:10,708 --> 00:44:11,793
Eat up.

690
00:44:11,876 --> 00:44:14,128
- No, you eat it.
- You can have all of it.

691
00:44:14,212 --> 00:44:16,130
What's with you? Just eat it, Mom.

692
00:44:16,214 --> 00:44:17,215
Here you go, ma'am!

693
00:44:18,383 --> 00:44:19,551
Thanks, Dad.

694
00:44:21,553 --> 00:44:22,512
Thank you, Dad.

695
00:44:24,847 --> 00:44:26,099
This is really good, Mom.

696
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:37,193
Are you okay?

697
00:44:37,777 --> 00:44:40,572
I mean, you saw
how much she loves to work.

698
00:44:40,655 --> 00:44:42,448
Imagine how hard it must've been for her.

699
00:44:43,825 --> 00:44:47,245
It's not that she didn't work.
She just never had the chance to.

700
00:44:49,455 --> 00:44:51,124
Thank goodness she's working now.

701
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,143
This picture came out well.

702
00:45:12,979 --> 00:45:14,188
This tasted so good.

703
00:45:19,277 --> 00:45:22,196
Even if you're going to gamble,
don't skip your meals.

704
00:45:24,616 --> 00:45:25,783
Where were we?

705
00:45:27,368 --> 00:45:28,620
The homeless.

706
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:30,204
You won't find anything from them.

707
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,915
People don't use them
to open accounts now?

708
00:45:32,999 --> 00:45:34,709
It's too complicated.

709
00:45:34,792 --> 00:45:37,587
You get prescriptions for drug patches
and sell them for money.

710
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:40,381
You think homeless people
still have health insurance?

711
00:45:41,883 --> 00:45:45,219
Our way's cleaner
in terms of processing transactions.

712
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:49,891
There's no kimchi?

713
00:45:51,267 --> 00:45:52,685
Could we have more kimchi, please?

714
00:45:52,769 --> 00:45:53,645
All right!

715
00:45:56,564 --> 00:45:59,484
We're different from those drug addicts.

716
00:46:00,526 --> 00:46:02,278
Drugs or gambling, it's all the same.

717
00:46:02,362 --> 00:46:03,529
Damn it!

718
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:05,948
Gambling only ruins individuals.

719
00:46:06,032 --> 00:46:08,910
But drugs ruin everyone around you too.

720
00:46:08,993 --> 00:46:09,994
People go down with you.

721
00:46:10,078 --> 00:46:11,663
Is that why you made your wife

722
00:46:11,746 --> 00:46:14,957
with terminal cancer
get you a prescription for drugs to sell

723
00:46:15,041 --> 00:46:15,958
so you could gamble?

724
00:46:16,042 --> 00:46:18,044
I told you it was just one time!

725
00:46:18,127 --> 00:46:19,087
Why?

726
00:46:20,171 --> 00:46:21,297
The insurance ran out.

727
00:46:25,343 --> 00:46:26,844
Can I get another bottle of soju?

728
00:46:26,928 --> 00:46:28,763
Just eat your food now, will you?

729
00:46:36,145 --> 00:46:37,230
Fentanyl.

730
00:46:38,064 --> 00:46:40,358
I know people
who distribute it professionally.

731
00:46:40,441 --> 00:46:42,568
- Another bottle of soju, please.
- Okay.

732
00:46:44,195 --> 00:46:45,154
This right here.

733
00:46:45,238 --> 00:46:47,198
It's a pretty big business.

734
00:46:47,281 --> 00:46:49,784
You know gambling dens
are in decline these days.

735
00:46:49,867 --> 00:46:51,577
They start doing it as a side job,

736
00:46:51,661 --> 00:46:53,621
and then, they make it their main work.

737
00:46:53,705 --> 00:46:55,123
That says it all.

738
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:57,250
If that's the case,

739
00:46:58,042 --> 00:46:59,836
where can I go to meet them?

740
00:47:03,881 --> 00:47:05,675
All I've had was soup.

741
00:47:05,758 --> 00:47:06,592
I feel so weak.

742
00:47:07,301 --> 00:47:08,553
Maybe if I had some meat,

743
00:47:08,636 --> 00:47:10,888
I'd have the strength to tell you.

744
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,309
Could we get a plate of boiled pork too?

745
00:47:15,393 --> 00:47:16,227
Okay.

746
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:17,145
A small plate.

747
00:47:17,645 --> 00:47:19,605
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

748
00:47:21,315 --> 00:47:23,276
All the fentanyl in Seohan's from here.

749
00:47:26,571 --> 00:47:27,780
Let's go today.

750
00:47:27,864 --> 00:47:28,698
Let's go.

751
00:47:30,783 --> 00:47:31,826
I'd like to go too.

752
00:47:31,909 --> 00:47:33,745
No, that's fine.

753
00:47:34,454 --> 00:47:35,371
Don't overdo it.

754
00:47:35,455 --> 00:47:37,582
I can go in disguise or sneak in.

755
00:47:38,124 --> 00:47:39,208
Let me back you up.

756
00:47:43,838 --> 00:47:48,259
<i>I'll take this chance to make sure
and show you that you need me.</i>

757
00:47:51,387 --> 00:47:52,722
When does Club Hovan open?

758
00:47:53,347 --> 00:47:55,767
I guess you didn't know,
but clubs open late.

759
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:57,477
It gets crowded after midnight.

760
00:47:58,019 --> 00:47:59,937
No, ordinary clubs are like that,

761
00:48:00,021 --> 00:48:03,232
but Club Hovan opens pretty early.

762
00:48:03,316 --> 00:48:07,236
So during the week, they open at 7:00 p.m.
for people getting off work.

763
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,154
Yeah.

764
00:48:08,237 --> 00:48:10,198
Have you already surveyed the location?

765
00:48:10,281 --> 00:48:13,284
I've been going for years,
so it's basic knowledge…

766
00:48:15,787 --> 00:48:18,623
It's basic knowledge to scout in advance.

767
00:48:18,706 --> 00:48:20,124
Yes, of course.

768
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:22,168
But people go to clubs at that hour?

769
00:48:22,794 --> 00:48:26,547
Gosh, Club Hovan lets people in
for free only from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m.

770
00:48:26,631 --> 00:48:28,925
On some days,
before doors open and until late at night,

771
00:48:29,008 --> 00:48:30,968
the line stretches all the way out.

772
00:48:31,052 --> 00:48:31,886
It's no joke.

773
00:48:31,969 --> 00:48:35,223
It's the hottest club
for young people to go to in this town.

774
00:48:43,898 --> 00:48:45,817
You know a lot about clubs in Seohan.

775
00:48:48,277 --> 00:48:50,488
My niece goes there often.

776
00:48:51,697 --> 00:48:52,740
She's a clubber.

777
00:48:59,205 --> 00:49:01,582
If they open at 7:00 p.m.,
let's wrap up and go.

778
00:49:02,875 --> 00:49:05,211
On the way there,
could I drop by somewhere?

779
00:49:05,294 --> 00:49:07,380
I'll meet you
in front of the club at 7:00 p.m.

780
00:49:07,463 --> 00:49:08,339
What for?

781
00:49:08,923 --> 00:49:10,132
We're going out to war,

782
00:49:10,675 --> 00:49:12,468
so we need to prepare for combat.

783
00:49:20,226 --> 00:49:21,853
Turn me into a trendy clubber.

784
00:49:21,936 --> 00:49:23,271
Not the disco, but a club?

785
00:49:23,354 --> 00:49:24,397
Damn it.

786
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,191
Make me shiny and sparkly.

787
00:49:27,275 --> 00:49:29,193
I need to be hot and pretty.

788
00:49:29,277 --> 00:49:31,654
- Okay.
- They're all dead meat.

789
00:49:31,737 --> 00:49:34,448
I wonder whose funeral it's going to be.

790
00:49:37,034 --> 00:49:39,203
- Looking like you're in your twenties?
- Yeah.

791
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:43,082
- I'm not done yet.
- I'm embarrassed.

792
00:49:53,134 --> 00:49:54,010
Open your eyes.

793
00:50:04,645 --> 00:50:06,856
<i>I'll go. I have the best chance to get in.</i>

794
00:50:38,721 --> 00:50:41,057
I let you come
since you insisted on this.

795
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:42,600
Don't worry.

796
00:50:42,683 --> 00:50:44,477
I'll make sure you have back up.

797
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,812
The art of undercover investigation.

798
00:50:48,564 --> 00:50:49,649
I'll show you what that is.

799
00:50:49,732 --> 00:50:52,193
Report every ten minutes once you get in.

800
00:50:52,276 --> 00:50:54,028
I'm going in if there's no word.

801
00:50:54,111 --> 00:50:55,112
Ms. Lim?

802
00:50:55,655 --> 00:50:58,074
Don't feel hurt if you can't get in.

803
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,868
This place has high standards.

804
00:51:03,621 --> 00:51:04,664
Don't worry.

805
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,217
Is this the right thing to do?

806
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,222
SEOHAN CITY SUNSET TIME

807
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:24,850
<i>I just need to hold on for three minutes.</i>

808
00:51:24,934 --> 00:51:25,851
<i>Three minutes.</i>

809
00:51:29,605 --> 00:51:30,815
Look and kick out the rejects.

810
00:51:41,117 --> 00:51:41,951
Excuse me?

811
00:51:45,121 --> 00:51:46,122
Ma'am?

812
00:51:47,206 --> 00:51:48,958
Excuse me? Hey, lady.

813
00:51:49,917 --> 00:51:50,751
Auntie?

814
00:51:50,835 --> 00:51:51,669
What's going on?

815
00:51:53,087 --> 00:51:54,046
Excuse me?

816
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:55,548
Don't pretend not to hear.

817
00:51:55,631 --> 00:51:56,632
Come on.

818
00:51:57,091 --> 00:51:58,092
Take the sunglasses off.

819
00:51:59,635 --> 00:52:01,178
Just come out. Now.

820
00:52:02,304 --> 00:52:03,139
Damn it.

821
00:52:03,222 --> 00:52:04,557
Me? What is it?

822
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,350
Your kid's not here. Go somewhere else.

823
00:52:07,601 --> 00:52:10,730
- Sweetie.
- "Sweetie"? Come on.

824
00:52:10,813 --> 00:52:12,064
You hurt my feelings.

825
00:52:12,148 --> 00:52:13,190
I'm not an old lady.

826
00:52:13,274 --> 00:52:16,110
You obviously are. Don't be ridiculous.

827
00:52:16,193 --> 00:52:17,903
I'm here to party with my friends.

828
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,114
Are you here to grocery shop?

829
00:52:20,197 --> 00:52:21,532
- Excuse me?
- Are you?

830
00:52:21,615 --> 00:52:23,409
They're young enough to be your nephews.

831
00:52:23,492 --> 00:52:25,161
Jeez. I was born in 1996.

832
00:52:25,244 --> 00:52:27,204
- Lady.
- I'm not a lady!

833
00:52:27,288 --> 00:52:28,372
Are you kidding me, lady?

834
00:52:28,456 --> 00:52:30,249
I was born in 1996!

835
00:52:30,332 --> 00:52:31,417
More like 1969!

836
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,169
You want to see my ID?

837
00:52:33,252 --> 00:52:34,545
- Poppy!
- Yes, boss?

838
00:52:34,628 --> 00:52:35,963
- Should I dance?
- Take her out.

839
00:52:36,047 --> 00:52:37,631
- Yes, sir.
- I was born in 1996.

840
00:52:37,715 --> 00:52:39,175
This way. Come on!

841
00:52:41,093 --> 00:52:42,511
Move it!

842
00:52:44,513 --> 00:52:45,765
Now's the time!

843
00:52:52,646 --> 00:52:54,356
Why did you push me?

844
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,316
This lady again?

845
00:52:55,399 --> 00:52:57,026
You want me to call the cops?

846
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,487
Aren't you the one born in 1969?

847
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:00,696
I'm sorry, miss.

848
00:53:01,781 --> 00:53:03,282
- Hey!
- Yes, boss?

849
00:53:03,365 --> 00:53:05,618
Come on. Show this young woman inside.

850
00:53:05,701 --> 00:53:06,994
- Yes, boss!
- Hurry up!

851
00:53:07,078 --> 00:53:09,038
Right this way!

852
00:53:09,622 --> 00:53:11,248
What? How did she get in?

853
00:53:11,332 --> 00:53:13,876
We'll do our best to serve you.

854
00:53:18,881 --> 00:53:20,132
Hey!

855
00:53:20,216 --> 00:53:22,093
- Who are you, mister?
- Let go.

856
00:53:22,176 --> 00:53:24,762
I came for fun! What's with you?
See? I'm a regular.

857
00:53:24,845 --> 00:53:25,679
Come on!

858
00:53:25,763 --> 00:53:28,015
Look at me! Look how cool I am!

859
00:53:28,933 --> 00:53:30,017
Wow, seriously?

860
00:53:30,101 --> 00:53:32,728
Why can they go in and I can't?

861
00:53:32,812 --> 00:53:35,189
Why? I'm wearing a leather jacket!

862
00:53:36,607 --> 00:53:38,609
Why can't I go in?

863
00:53:50,955 --> 00:53:51,789
Jeez.

864
00:53:55,251 --> 00:53:57,837
I'll wait in the back.

865
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,338
Just go home.

866
00:54:21,073 --> 00:54:21,907
I'm in.

867
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:24,160
I'll be waiting outside.

868
00:54:24,243 --> 00:54:25,870
Call me if something happens.

869
00:54:25,953 --> 00:54:27,121
It's every ten minutes.

870
00:54:27,204 --> 00:54:28,873
I'm going in if you don't call.

871
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:39,467
I would've gone in
if we weren't undercover.

872
00:55:05,618 --> 00:55:08,245
<i>I should be getting approached by now.</i>

873
00:55:48,327 --> 00:55:49,912
<i>They do deals in the rooms.</i>

874
00:55:49,995 --> 00:55:51,247
From what we know,

875
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:54,542
this area with clubs, bars,
cabarets, and other establishments

876
00:55:54,625 --> 00:55:56,335
are managed by the Bald Head Gang.

877
00:55:58,337 --> 00:55:59,797
Let's be serious.

878
00:56:00,381 --> 00:56:01,298
I'm sorry.

879
00:56:02,049 --> 00:56:03,926
The Bald Head Gang manages them,

880
00:56:04,009 --> 00:56:07,221
but they wouldn't openly deal drugs
no matter how bold they were.

881
00:56:07,304 --> 00:56:09,515
They'll do deals in rooms for VIPs.

882
00:56:09,598 --> 00:56:13,227
In other words, we need evidence
of deals being done in the rooms.

883
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:14,186
That's right.

884
00:56:18,023 --> 00:56:20,276
Should I see if we can disguise her
as kitchen staff?

885
00:56:21,068 --> 00:56:23,320
It's not a restaurant.
Why would they go in a room?

886
00:56:23,404 --> 00:56:24,363
So…

887
00:56:25,072 --> 00:56:27,074
I just have to get into the VIP room?

888
00:56:46,427 --> 00:56:47,261
Wait a second.

889
00:56:56,479 --> 00:56:57,563
I'm entering the VIP room.

890
00:56:58,230 --> 00:56:59,565
The VIP room?

891
00:57:00,441 --> 00:57:02,610
There's a cabaret near here too.

892
00:57:02,693 --> 00:57:04,695
Did you go into the wrong place?

893
00:57:04,778 --> 00:57:06,614
<i>- Are you in Club Hovan?</i>
- Let's go in.

894
00:57:15,706 --> 00:57:16,957
<i>- Holy cow!
- What?</i>

895
00:57:17,041 --> 00:57:17,875
<i>She's killer!</i>

896
00:57:18,667 --> 00:57:19,502
Killer?

897
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:21,962
What's killer?

898
00:57:23,464 --> 00:57:24,673
Over here!

899
00:57:28,219 --> 00:57:29,470
These are drugs?

900
00:57:29,553 --> 00:57:31,347
These are fentanyl patches.

901
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:34,517
They're supposed to be for patients
to alleviate their pain.

902
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,478
But drug addicts
illegally obtain and abuse them.

903
00:57:37,561 --> 00:57:39,563
So I just have to find these shapes?

904
00:57:39,647 --> 00:57:40,606
NUMBER 3

905
00:57:41,232 --> 00:57:42,483
This way! Take a seat.

906
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,277
- You too.
- Come here. Sit down.

907
00:57:46,779 --> 00:57:48,197
You're loving this too much.

908
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,783
Why are you so far away? Come here.

909
00:57:51,408 --> 00:57:52,576
Want to take this?

910
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:54,119
It's great.

911
00:57:54,203 --> 00:57:55,204
Your mind goes numb.

912
00:57:55,287 --> 00:57:57,164
- Come on.
- I said it's not.

913
00:57:57,248 --> 00:57:58,332
- What are you doing?
- Drink.

914
00:57:58,415 --> 00:58:00,668
You looked hot.
Doesn't your shoulder hurt?

915
00:58:01,919 --> 00:58:02,836
I'm fine.

916
00:58:04,129 --> 00:58:05,047
But my wrist…

917
00:58:07,925 --> 00:58:09,301
Your wrist hurts?

918
00:58:09,927 --> 00:58:11,303
You should do this then.

919
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:12,471
What are you doing?

920
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:14,265
You said your wrist hurt.

921
00:58:14,348 --> 00:58:16,976
It'll feel much better
if you massage it like this.

922
00:58:25,192 --> 00:58:26,694
What the hell?

923
00:58:28,862 --> 00:58:30,322
Why hasn't she reported in?

924
00:58:31,115 --> 00:58:32,575
It's been almost ten minutes.

925
00:58:35,744 --> 00:58:36,829
Ms. Lim?

926
00:58:36,912 --> 00:58:37,997
Mr. Ju?

927
00:58:39,373 --> 00:58:40,249
What's going on?

928
00:58:50,134 --> 00:58:51,552
I'm here to check something.

929
00:58:51,635 --> 00:58:52,469
PUBLIC SERVANT

930
00:58:52,553 --> 00:58:53,512
Hello, Mr. Gye.

931
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:56,307
Is that what you expected, punk?

932
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:58,017
What do you take us for?

933
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,560
Posing as a prosecutor?

934
00:59:00,686 --> 00:59:03,647
What do you take us for, you punk? Well?

935
00:59:05,274 --> 00:59:06,567
You started this.

936
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:07,526
You little punk.

937
00:59:15,826 --> 00:59:17,202
Get that punk going in now!

938
00:59:17,286 --> 00:59:18,787
He's crazy! Just stop him!

939
00:59:49,234 --> 00:59:52,279
Hey, that crazy bastard
is going up right now!

940
00:59:54,031 --> 00:59:55,366
Damn it!

941
00:59:55,449 --> 00:59:57,201
What were you doing? Damn it.

942
00:59:57,826 --> 00:59:59,370
- Yes, boss.
- What is it?

943
00:59:59,453 --> 01:00:00,663
Let's go. Run!

944
01:00:01,705 --> 01:00:02,581
What's going on?

945
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:11,465
What the hell are you doing?

946
01:00:11,548 --> 01:00:13,342
You touched my stomach!

947
01:00:13,425 --> 01:00:14,426
- You little…
- Do-gyeong.

948
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:16,387
Your face is red, man!

949
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:17,471
Shut your mouth.

950
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:21,392
- What's this?
- My purse.

951
01:00:21,475 --> 01:00:22,351
Give it to me.

952
01:00:28,899 --> 01:00:30,317
I can't believe this bitch.

953
01:00:44,123 --> 01:00:45,874
Did you hit me with a bottle?

954
01:00:45,958 --> 01:00:47,418
This is self-defense now.

955
01:01:11,066 --> 01:01:12,526
Wait. Let me borrow this.

956
01:01:12,609 --> 01:01:13,652
What?

957
01:01:34,798 --> 01:01:36,508
You dare play tricks, you bitch?

958
01:01:42,514 --> 01:01:43,390
Ms. Lim!

959
01:01:46,435 --> 01:01:47,478
Ms. Lim!

960
01:01:55,944 --> 01:01:56,987
Let's shoot a real video.

961
01:01:57,070 --> 01:01:57,988
- Let's do it.
- Hey!

962
01:01:58,071 --> 01:01:59,323
Hey!

963
01:01:59,406 --> 01:02:00,866
- What's with you?
- Stop it!

964
01:02:00,949 --> 01:02:03,452
I'm feeling high right now,
so why should I stop?

965
01:02:46,954 --> 01:02:49,873
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

966
01:02:50,958 --> 01:02:53,293
<i>Ko Won wasn't the target
for the acid, was he?</i>

967
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:55,754
Ms. Lee Mi-jin?

968
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:57,256
<i>You don't care about others.</i>

969
01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:00,759
<i>But technically, you're not just anyone.</i>

970
01:03:02,261 --> 01:03:04,930
Everything you say is so typical,
but it's nice.

971
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:09,268
<i>Before I expose
why you tried to kill that person,</i>

972
01:03:09,351 --> 01:03:10,644
<i>handle it now.</i>

973
01:03:10,727 --> 01:03:12,980
<i>This is why I don't like
working with people</i>

974
01:03:13,063 --> 01:03:15,107
who are old, inexperienced, and chatty.

975
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:17,109
<i>You're selfish.</i>

976
01:03:17,192 --> 01:03:19,152
You're mean too.

977
01:03:22,447 --> 01:03:25,707
