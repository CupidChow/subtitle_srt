- Can we take it off?
- Thanks, guys.

5
00:00:23,496 --> 00:00:24,726
- Let's take it off.
- I'll do it.

6
00:00:24,796 --> 00:00:25,926
- All right.
- Seriously,

7
00:00:26,347 --> 00:00:28,277
are there no surveillance cameras inside the apartment complex?

8
00:00:28,407 --> 00:00:30,077
There weren't any in that area.

9
00:00:30,277 --> 00:00:31,277
Hold on.

Hey!

12
00:00:34,348 --> 00:00:37,057
How could you let this happen as the Chief of Security?

13
00:00:38,087 --> 00:00:39,216
It's not like he's the president.

14
00:00:39,217 --> 00:00:40,787
I wasn't going to escort him to his house.

15
00:00:41,527 --> 00:00:43,327
That's right. He got hurt on his own.

16
00:00:43,597 --> 00:00:44,597
Hello.

- Yes, Sang Hyeon.

21
00:00:54,707 --> 00:00:56,707
Your head looks like a packaged fruit.

22
00:00:57,537 --> 00:00:58,736
Still, it looks better than yesterday.

23
00:00:58,737 --> 00:01:00,546
See? I told you so.

24
00:01:00,547 --> 00:01:02,077
Tell me if you feel strange in the slightest.

25
00:01:02,407 --> 00:01:04,217
I've talked to my uncle about it.

26
00:01:04,347 --> 00:01:06,186
- Is his uncle a doctor?
- No, he's a hospital director.

27
00:01:06,187 --> 00:01:07,187
A hospital director?

28
00:01:07,188 --> 00:01:08,787

- In any case,

30
00:01:10,187 --> 00:01:11,757

31

By the way,

32
00:01:13,058 --> 00:01:15,457
what happened to the culprit?

33
00:01:16,597 --> 00:01:17,597
I don't know.

34
00:01:18,157 --> 00:01:20,426
We did put up a banner to find the witnesses,

35
00:01:20,427 --> 00:01:22,267
but there haven't been any important tip-offs.

36
00:01:22,527 --> 00:01:25,537
By any chance, is there a police officer in your family?

37
00:01:25,767 --> 00:01:27,437
- For goodness' sake.
- Of course not.

38
00:01:27,607 --> 00:01:29,066
You're so childish.

39
00:01:29,067 --> 00:01:30,237
Sang Hyeon, please excuse me.

40
00:01:30,407 --> 00:01:31,976
We'll wrap up Noh Se's makeup.

- Okay. Please do a good job.
- Okay.

42

- Guys, gather around.
- Okay.

43
00:01:35,977 --> 00:01:37,816
We should switch up the concept.

44
00:01:37,817 --> 00:01:38,817
That's what I'm saying.

45
00:01:38,818 --> 00:01:39,916
- The one with the curling iron.
- Yes?

46
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:41,346
- Shall we add some curls?
- That's a good idea.

47

- Let's do that.

- Do a good job with shading, okay?

53
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:54,597
I washed my hair.

You've been more annoying recently.

67

Think about it.

68
00:02:25,057 --> 00:02:26,197
He says...

69
00:02:26,927 --> 00:02:28,527
that it was an attempted hit-and-run.

70
00:02:29,027 --> 00:02:31,267
Why is he wearing that on his head when he's completely fine?

71

72
00:02:33,267 --> 00:02:35,267
It must be a tiny wound.

75
00:02:39,807 --> 00:02:41,107

77
00:02:44,647 --> 00:02:45,647
No.

78

He clearly said that it was a miss.

Your shoes are soaked as well.

177
00:06:48,627 --> 00:06:49,627
Thank you.

178
00:06:51,857 --> 00:06:53,397
As the weather forecast is always wrong,

179
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:55,297
I'm sure you've struggled because you didn't have an umbrella.

180
00:06:55,697 --> 00:06:56,866
It's annoying...

181
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:58,467
when your favourite shoes get wet.

182
00:06:58,797 --> 00:07:00,107
- Thus, - Thus...

183
00:07:00,707 --> 00:07:02,736
we'll set up an umbrella rental shop inside the school.

184
00:07:02,737 --> 00:07:04,806
And we'll propose to the school about wearing sandals...

185
00:07:04,807 --> 00:07:06,547
on rainy days.

186
00:07:08,207 --> 00:07:09,706
Hey, what's this?

187
00:07:09,707 --> 00:07:10,916
- All right!
- Let's go!

188
00:07:10,917 --> 00:07:12,116
Turn off the water!

189
00:07:12,117 --> 00:07:13,446
Let's go!

190
00:07:13,447 --> 00:07:14,887
(Youngjin High School)

191
00:07:16,887 --> 00:07:17,917
Turn off the water!

192
00:07:18,257 --> 00:07:20,357
- This is cheating!
- Turn off the water!

193
00:07:22,127 --> 00:07:23,996
Go up there and check.

194
00:07:23,997 --> 00:07:25,596
So Hee, go and draw up a list.

195
00:07:25,597 --> 00:07:27,326
Candidate two doesn't disappoint!

196
00:07:27,327 --> 00:07:29,166
Umbrellas are better than Paik's Coffee!

197
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:30,636
- Come on.
- Don't get worked up.

198
00:07:30,637 --> 00:07:32,837
Had this been allowed, we would've set things on fire.

199
00:07:33,207 --> 00:07:35,636
The pride of Youngjin High School! Get ready!

200
00:07:35,637 --> 00:07:37,136
- Yes!
- Yes!

201
00:07:37,137 --> 00:07:38,237
Three, four.

202
00:07:38,507 --> 00:07:39,806
- The pride of Youngjin High School, - The pride of Youngjin High School,

203
00:07:39,807 --> 00:07:41,176
- Yang Won Dae is here!
- Yang Won Dae is here!

204
00:07:41,177 --> 00:07:43,416
- Candidate 2, Yang Won Dae!
- Candidate 2, Yang Won Dae!

205
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:45,076
- An umbrella is a must, okay?
- Protect Youngjin High School!

206
00:07:45,077 --> 00:07:46,376
- Citizen Police Won Dae!
- Citizen Police Won Dae!

207

- Candidate 2, Yang Won Dae!
- Candidate 2, Yang Won Dae!

- Yang Won Dae!
- Yang Won Dae!

209
00:07:55,457 --> 00:07:56,487
Let's go!

210
00:07:57,827 --> 00:07:59,996
(Live Support Ratings: Kwak Sang Hyeon versus Yang Won Dae)

211
00:07:59,997 --> 00:08:01,067
Candidate two.

212
00:08:01,927 --> 00:08:03,197
Guys.

213
00:08:03,767 --> 00:08:05,796
- Let's go.
- Hey.

214
00:08:05,797 --> 00:08:07,367
- Stop it.
- Hey.

215
00:08:08,507 --> 00:08:09,976
- Come on.
- Candidate one.

216
00:08:09,977 --> 00:08:11,477
- Yes!
- Yes!

217
00:08:12,037 --> 00:08:13,476
- Let's go.
- Hey.

218
00:08:13,477 --> 00:08:14,747
Hey.

219
00:08:15,747 --> 00:08:16,916
Hey.

220
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:18,776
Our candidate is better.

221
00:08:18,777 --> 00:08:20,616
(Student vice president candidate)

222
00:08:20,617 --> 00:08:21,617
I'm candidate one.

223
00:08:21,618 --> 00:08:22,916
I was so startled.

224
00:08:22,917 --> 00:08:24,286
- Seriously.
- You won't die.

225
00:08:24,287 --> 00:08:25,716
- I never catch a cold.
- When will my hair dry?

226
00:08:25,717 --> 00:08:26,856
It's fine.

227
00:08:26,857 --> 00:08:27,857
They sprayed a lot of water.

228
00:08:27,858 --> 00:08:29,557
- Is there a hairdryer anywhere?
- What?

229
00:08:29,827 --> 00:08:31,097
Guys, let's go.

230
00:08:31,557 --> 00:08:33,566
- Shall we go to the snack bar?
- Let's go to the snack bar.

231
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:34,597
Let's go.

232
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:36,637
Come on.

233
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:40,637
What happened?

234
00:08:41,937 --> 00:08:43,477
Why didn't you say anything?

235
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:45,007
I was so startled.

236
00:08:46,107 --> 00:08:47,607
It wasn't like I got 100 stitches.

237
00:08:51,277 --> 00:08:53,517
I heard that it'd be impossible to catch the hit-and-runner.

238
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,117
The thing is,

239
00:08:56,717 --> 00:08:58,587
it wasn't a hit-and-run by 100 percent.

240
00:08:59,987 --> 00:09:02,257
It was more of a miss-and-run.

241
00:09:05,297 --> 00:09:06,297
In any case,

242
00:09:06,298 --> 00:09:08,027
the culprit should be caught and brought to justice.

243
00:09:09,097 --> 00:09:11,237
Why are you making a fuss when I'm the one who got hurt?

244
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:12,897
Maybe you should catch the culprit.

245
00:09:14,737 --> 00:09:17,677
Why are you so angry?

246
00:09:18,337 --> 00:09:19,337
I'll get going.

247
00:09:24,617 --> 00:09:26,477
I guess Noh Se Hoon finds you easy.

248
00:09:26,687 --> 00:09:28,287
He treats you in the most casual way.

249
00:09:29,517 --> 00:09:31,517
Well, his behaviour is understandable.

250
00:09:31,657 --> 00:09:34,057
I forgot. They finished setting up in the Music Room.

251
00:09:34,287 --> 00:09:35,357
Okay.

252
00:09:35,427 --> 00:09:37,097
- At what hour does it begin?
- Let's go.

253
00:09:38,657 --> 00:09:40,396
- Do a good job with the interview.
- Speak for yourself.

254
00:09:40,397 --> 00:09:41,727
I always do a good job.

255
00:09:44,397 --> 00:09:45,437
Noh Se Hoon.

256
00:09:47,407 --> 00:09:48,507
Hey, Ann Tae Oh.

257
00:09:49,537 --> 00:09:51,377
What was that yesterday?

258
00:09:52,537 --> 00:09:55,207
It isn't something we can discuss at a place like this.

259
00:09:55,907 --> 00:09:56,977
Follow me.

260
00:10:08,527 --> 00:10:11,397
I went to the Music Room recently to complain to the music teacher...

261
00:10:11,727 --> 00:10:12,997
about the midterm.

262
00:10:13,427 --> 00:10:15,367
The music teacher? What did you want to complain about?

263
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:17,397
The singing test.

264
00:10:18,137 --> 00:10:20,237
Since people are born with their singing skills,

265
00:10:20,507 --> 00:10:21,806
I thought it was unfair...

266
00:10:21,807 --> 00:10:23,877
to grade students that way.

267
00:10:24,377 --> 00:10:25,577
Is that so?

268
00:10:26,607 --> 00:10:27,677
So what's this about?

269
00:10:28,877 --> 00:10:30,116
Again,

270
00:10:30,117 --> 00:10:32,047
you should remember that I wasn't snooping.

271
00:10:32,547 --> 00:10:34,817
Had I not seen my name, I wouldn't have been interested.

272
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,757
I care about myself the most.

273
00:10:59,437 --> 00:11:00,447
What?

274
00:11:03,717 --> 00:11:05,116
(Yoon Jeong Hui: Bad personality, many haters, a total wench)

275
00:11:05,117 --> 00:11:06,446
(Song Jun: Suitable, but is planning to transfer to another school)

276
00:11:06,447 --> 00:11:07,787
(Ann Tae Oh: Pretty smart and popular among model students)

277
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,556
(Choi Ji Hye: Smart, but shy. Incredibly rich)

278
00:11:12,557 --> 00:11:14,527
(Koo Jun Hoe: Rumoured to be Koo Jun Yup's nephew)

279
00:11:19,997 --> 00:11:21,097
What's this?

280
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:23,766
Someone wrote comments...

281
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,337
on the top 15 students.

282
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:30,707
"Ann Tae Oh, Pretty smart..."

283
00:11:31,437 --> 00:11:33,777
"and popular among model students."

284
00:11:35,477 --> 00:11:37,517
What? Is it true?

285
00:11:38,277 --> 00:11:41,117
The credibility of the information is quite high.

286
00:11:43,857 --> 00:11:44,886
Does that mean...

287
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:47,187
If you go down further, you see a comment about you.

288
00:11:47,727 --> 00:11:48,827
That's the point.

289
00:11:52,597 --> 00:11:53,796
(Noh Se Hoon)

290
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:54,867
"Noh Se Hoon,"

291
00:11:56,197 --> 00:11:58,397
"not recommended since his reputation is ruined."

292
00:11:59,867 --> 00:12:01,467
"Suitable for charity votes!"

293
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:04,207
What's this?

294
00:12:04,837 --> 00:12:06,137
Who wrote this?

295
00:12:07,177 --> 00:12:08,177
Of course.

296
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,247
- In any case, use it as you want.
- Thank you.

297
00:12:10,517 --> 00:12:11,977
- You've guessed it.
- Tae Oh.

298
00:12:13,147 --> 00:12:14,916
It was the man who asked me...

299
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:16,587
to enter the election with him until a few days ago,

300
00:12:17,317 --> 00:12:18,487
Yang Won Dae.

301
00:12:20,287 --> 00:12:22,757
You decided to enter the election with him the very next day.

302
00:12:23,287 --> 00:12:25,797
It was ridiculous, but understandable.

303
00:12:27,197 --> 00:12:29,796
In any case, he needed a model student like us...

304
00:12:29,797 --> 00:12:31,797
as a mascot.

305
00:12:32,837 --> 00:12:33,907
Yang Won Dae.

306
00:12:39,607 --> 00:12:40,677
Yang Won Dae!

307
00:12:44,047 --> 00:12:45,047
For goodness' sake.

308
00:12:46,147 --> 00:12:47,747
"Not recommended since his reputation is ruined."

309
00:12:48,547 --> 00:12:49,687
"Suitable for charity votes!"

310
00:12:52,517 --> 00:12:54,727
(Again with Yang Won Dae!)

311
00:12:56,627 --> 00:12:58,697
(Again with Yang Won Dae!)

312
00:13:25,257 --> 00:13:26,317
Yes?

313
00:13:28,127 --> 00:13:29,127
Okay.

314
00:13:31,497 --> 00:13:32,727
(Let the small changes make the school big!)

315
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:37,496
Now comes the best segment,

316
00:13:37,497 --> 00:13:39,697
self...

317
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,067
Introduction!

318
00:13:43,107 --> 00:13:44,206
(Let the small changes make the school big!)

319
00:13:44,207 --> 00:13:45,377
Now,

320
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:47,807
Won Dae, please introduce yourself first.

321
00:13:47,877 --> 00:13:50,317
- Okay.
- Hold on.

322
00:13:50,347 --> 00:13:51,576
What?

323
00:13:51,577 --> 00:13:52,677
- Who is this?
- What?

324
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:54,517
When did you prepare this?

325
00:13:54,787 --> 00:13:56,546
- Citizen Police Yang Won Dae!
- Okay.

326
00:13:56,547 --> 00:13:58,657
You can't enter during the shoot.

327
00:13:58,787 --> 00:13:59,856
Please stop such people.

328
00:13:59,857 --> 00:14:01,427
What's this photo?

329
00:14:02,687 --> 00:14:03,896
Recently,

330
00:14:03,897 --> 00:14:05,927
I received a certificate as an honorary citizen police.

331
00:14:07,027 --> 00:14:08,126
How?

332
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,437
I had watched a show on voice phishing scams.

333
00:14:11,937 --> 00:14:14,307
A mobile relay station? It was in the car.

334
00:14:14,637 --> 00:14:18,477
He could've been an employee or an expert.

335
00:14:19,037 --> 00:14:22,447
I read the room while pretending to administer first aid.

336
00:14:22,977 --> 00:14:24,417
He asked me questions nonstop.

337
00:14:24,547 --> 00:14:26,447
"Did you make a report? Did you call the police?"

338
00:14:26,517 --> 00:14:27,547
'When did you do that?"

339
00:14:27,687 --> 00:14:29,347
How suspicious.

340
00:14:30,857 --> 00:14:31,887
Go on.

341
00:14:32,057 --> 00:14:34,326
I quickly reported it to the police via a text message.

342
00:14:34,327 --> 00:14:35,557
(Ask about the student council election.)

343
00:14:35,757 --> 00:14:38,227
Now, Yang Won Dae,

344
00:14:38,427 --> 00:14:40,867
please give us the slogan for candidate two.

345
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:43,637
Camp two, are you ready?

346
00:14:44,037 --> 00:14:45,437
- Yes!
- Yes!

347
00:14:45,597 --> 00:14:46,636
Y for Yang!

348
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:47,706
- Your charms are endless...
- Your charms are endless...

349
00:14:47,707 --> 00:14:49,837
- just like an onion!
- just like an onion!

350
00:14:49,967 --> 00:14:50,976
W for Won!

351
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:53,207
- Work for your huge dream!
- Work for your huge dream!

352
00:14:53,337 --> 00:14:54,346
D for Dae!

353
00:14:54,347 --> 00:14:56,147
- Dear love of Youngjin High, - Dear love of Youngjin High,

354
00:14:56,207 --> 00:14:59,047
- it's all for Won Dae!
- it's all for Won Dae!

355
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:01,347
Yang Won Dae!

356
00:15:01,687 --> 00:15:02,816
- Yang Won Dae!
- Hello,

357
00:15:02,817 --> 00:15:06,486
I'm in charge of beauty and popularity in this school.

358
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:07,587
My name is Ha Yu Gyeong.

359
00:15:07,827 --> 00:15:10,297
- Ha Yu Gyeong!
- Ha Yu Gyeong!

360
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:12,627
- You're pretty!
- Ha Yu Gyeong!

361
00:15:12,757 --> 00:15:15,267
- Ha Yu Gyeong!
- Ha Yu Gyeong!

362
00:15:15,867 --> 00:15:18,337
As for me, other people tell me...

363
00:15:18,567 --> 00:15:21,407
that I'm a popular guy.

364
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:24,437
Did you prepare a specialty of a popular guy?

365
00:15:24,537 --> 00:15:27,176
Yes. I prepared something short.

366
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,177
That sounds great.

367
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:30,206
Since this is the camp for candidate two,

368
00:15:30,207 --> 00:15:32,516
people who know the song should sing along.

369
00:15:32,517 --> 00:15:34,447
Let's give him a round of applause.

370
00:15:36,847 --> 00:15:39,316
I knew intuitively

371
00:15:39,317 --> 00:15:41,856
That I'd get to go on a school trip

372
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:44,296
Won Dae's pledge, school trip

373
00:15:44,297 --> 00:15:46,296
- I couldn't forget the thrill - Let's go!

374
00:15:46,297 --> 00:15:47,367
That's it!

375
00:15:47,867 --> 00:15:51,137
(Lee Chang Ho)

376
00:15:52,597 --> 00:15:53,967
- That's it!
- All right.

377
00:15:54,007 --> 00:15:56,107
- I'll stop here.
- You're cool.

378
00:15:58,437 --> 00:15:59,507
You're cool.

379
00:16:01,907 --> 00:16:03,477
- Hey, Noh Se Hoon.
- You're cool.

380
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:06,377
Are you going to stand there and watch?

381
00:16:07,047 --> 00:16:08,047
What?

382
00:16:08,187 --> 00:16:09,846
Let's go, okay?

383
00:16:09,847 --> 00:16:11,057
Yang Won Dae!

384
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:12,787
- Yang Won Dae!
- Yang Won Dae!

385

- Yang Won Dae!

386
00:16:15,087 --> 00:16:17,797

- Yang Won Dae!

387
00:16:18,357 --> 00:16:19,557

- Yang Won Dae!

388
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:22,797

390

Hold on. Let me remove his eye booger.

391
00:16:30,107 --> 00:16:32,577
Mr. Sin, please hurry up and check since we'll use them tomorrow.

392
00:16:33,337 --> 00:16:35,077
You guys are something else.

393
00:16:37,677 --> 00:16:39,677
By the way, who applied for the Qtube shoot?

394
00:16:40,047 --> 00:16:41,116
Ha Yu Gyeong...

395
00:16:41,117 --> 00:16:43,047
and her friends used their connections on social media.

396
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:46,087
Yu Gyeong's connections are totally lit.

397
00:16:46,717 --> 00:16:47,756
Mr. Sin,

398
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,757
don't copy young people's slang in an awkward way.

399
00:16:50,087 --> 00:16:51,357
Okay.

400
00:16:51,597 --> 00:16:52,857
Hurry up and check them.

401
00:16:54,827 --> 00:16:55,927
Sang Hyeon.

402
00:16:57,597 --> 00:17:00,166
- I'll get going. Please hurry.
- Okay. You guys should get going.

403
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:01,337
- I'll get going.
- Okay.

404
00:17:06,977 --> 00:17:09,107
You must be working hard.

405
00:17:12,177 --> 00:17:13,947
Your schedule is hectic due to the election, right?

406
00:17:14,217 --> 00:17:15,347
Is it doable?

407
00:17:17,957 --> 00:17:19,657
How about you, Sang Hyeon? Are things going well?

408
00:17:21,657 --> 00:17:22,927
Did they make these?

409
00:17:23,087 --> 00:17:24,427
It looks like...

410
00:17:25,327 --> 00:17:27,227
Yang Won Dae is determined to win this time.

411
00:17:28,927 --> 00:17:30,497
Isn't what they did earlier cheating?

412
00:17:31,197 --> 00:17:33,337
They gathered the camp members and had a shoot.

413
00:17:34,307 --> 00:17:37,107
The principal allowed it, so it isn't exactly cheating.

414
00:17:37,237 --> 00:17:38,307
It's cheating.

415
00:17:39,107 --> 00:17:40,577
It's media manipulation.

416
00:17:40,747 --> 00:17:42,747
Calling it media manipulation would be a stretch.

417
00:17:43,107 --> 00:17:45,517
Why are you being so sensitive?

418
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,347
Mr. Sin.

419
00:17:49,887 --> 00:17:50,917
Yes?

420
00:17:51,657 --> 00:17:53,587
Since you're in the Election Commission,

421
00:17:54,327 --> 00:17:56,127
you should check these things properly.

422
00:17:57,557 --> 00:17:59,027
Why didn't you tell me before?

423
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:01,567
The thing is,

424
00:18:03,297 --> 00:18:05,497
I only heard about it last night.

425
00:18:06,537 --> 00:18:08,137
So you heard about it last night.

426
00:18:12,877 --> 00:18:13,907
From now on,

427
00:18:15,847 --> 00:18:17,277
be more attentive.

428
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,447
Please.

429
00:18:21,487 --> 00:18:23,217
Yes, of course.

430
00:18:24,957 --> 00:18:26,217
I will, okay?

433
00:18:37,437 --> 00:18:39,697
Should we make some of those too? The displays.

434
00:18:39,897 --> 00:18:40,936
Don't bother.

435
00:18:40,937 --> 00:18:43,007
Isn't the whole citizen police thing getting old now?

436
00:18:43,067 --> 00:18:44,076
I'm not into it.

437
00:18:44,077 --> 00:18:45,907
I know, right? I'm not either.

438
00:18:46,077 --> 00:18:47,706
The school isn't some supermarket.

439
00:18:47,707 --> 00:18:50,947
You're right. It looks so fake that it's annoying.

440
00:18:55,947 --> 00:18:57,587
Should we break all of those?

441
00:18:57,917 --> 00:18:58,917
Sorry?

442
00:18:59,417 --> 00:19:01,157
Or we could just set them on fire.

quit running your mouth and do something for once, will you?

446
00:19:14,137 --> 00:19:17,337

Right in front of the teacher?

531
00:25:59,207 --> 00:26:00,707
So what, Won Dae?

532
00:26:02,747 --> 00:26:04,077

I'm sorry.

534
00:26:18,957 --> 00:26:20,257

00:26:22,297 --> 00:26:23,997
your actions hurt our team's image?

537
00:26:24,797 --> 00:26:25,837
Hey.

538
00:26:26,137 --> 00:26:27,867
Do what fits you best.

539
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:30,007
Understood.

540
00:26:35,047 --> 00:26:36,047
For real?

541
00:26:38,117 --> 00:26:39,117
Wait up!

542
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,316
(Rest in peace, democracy.)

543
00:26:44,317 --> 00:26:47,857
(The third rally)

544
00:26:47,957 --> 00:26:50,056
- Isn't this too much?
- Is someone dead?

545
00:26:50,057 --> 00:26:51,396
- Cut it out.
- This is wrong.

546
00:26:51,397 --> 00:26:52,926
(Return Youngjin High's lost democracy.)

547
00:26:52,927 --> 00:26:54,767
- What are they doing?
- This is awful.

548
00:26:55,367 --> 00:26:57,267
- Chill with the show, will you?
- Gosh.

549
00:26:58,437 --> 00:26:59,697
Today, our candidates...

550
00:26:59,897 --> 00:27:02,567
will conduct a silent campaign throughout the day.

551
00:27:03,067 --> 00:27:04,307
Instead,

552
00:27:04,437 --> 00:27:07,137
here's an endorsement speech from candidate two's team.

553
00:27:07,677 --> 00:27:09,576
Nam Gyeong Tae from Grade 1, Class 4.

554
00:27:09,577 --> 00:27:11,247
What is he wearing on his head?

555
00:27:11,647 --> 00:27:13,977
- Come on.
- You're going too far.

556
00:27:14,247 --> 00:27:15,446
- Seriously?
- Gosh.

557
00:27:15,447 --> 00:27:18,017
- Know your limit.
- Disgusting.

558
00:27:18,257 --> 00:27:19,257
(Live Support Ratings: Kwak Sang Hyeon versus Yang Won Dae)

559
00:27:19,258 --> 00:27:20,886
- They just look like idiots.
- Really?

560
00:27:20,887 --> 00:27:22,526
- This is too much.
- Unbelievable.

561
00:27:22,527 --> 00:27:24,086
- What the heck.
- Cut it out.

562
00:27:24,087 --> 00:27:25,357
- It's ridiculous.
- Gross.

563
00:27:25,457 --> 00:27:27,697
Must they go that far with it?

564
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:28,967
What the...

565
00:27:29,467 --> 00:27:30,467
(Rest in peace, democracy.)

566
00:27:30,468 --> 00:27:32,066
- What is he doing?
- Unbelievable.

567
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,296
- Gosh.
- Hey.

568
00:27:33,297 --> 00:27:34,607
- Upload it on QTube.
- For real.

569
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:35,966
That's just plain rude.

570
00:27:35,967 --> 00:27:37,267
They're acting crazy.

571
00:27:37,777 --> 00:27:39,306
- This is crazy.
- Really?

572
00:27:39,307 --> 00:27:41,047
- For real?
- What's wrong with him?

573
00:27:41,177 --> 00:27:42,846
- Where did he learn to do that?
- I know, right?

574
00:27:42,847 --> 00:27:44,376
- Is he an attention seeker?
- What next?

575
00:27:44,377 --> 00:27:46,316
- Leave him be.
- This is outrageous.

576
00:27:46,317 --> 00:27:47,677
These fools are being foolish.

577
00:27:48,287 --> 00:27:50,416
- Hi!
- Hi, my foot.

578
00:27:50,417 --> 00:27:51,486
(Punish election vandals!)

579
00:27:51,487 --> 00:27:52,517
I'm...

580
00:27:53,357 --> 00:27:54,587
Nam Gyeong Tae...

581
00:27:55,357 --> 00:27:56,757
from Grade 1, Class 4,

582
00:27:57,227 --> 00:27:58,956
serving on campaign team two...

583
00:27:58,957 --> 00:28:01,167
as an election strategist and singing bass in our choir.

584
00:28:02,727 --> 00:28:04,637
Today,

585
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,707
I speak to you, our voters, with grief.

586
00:28:09,737 --> 00:28:10,907
Our school needs...

587
00:28:11,577 --> 00:28:15,077
a leader with long experience and strong leadership.

588
00:28:15,877 --> 00:28:18,346
What can someone with no experience possibly change...

589
00:28:18,347 --> 00:28:19,617
as the student council president?

590
00:28:20,277 --> 00:28:21,416
(Return Youngjin High's lost democracy.)

591
00:28:21,417 --> 00:28:23,247
Isn't a candidate trying for his second year...

592
00:28:25,087 --> 00:28:27,157
better than one with none?

593
00:28:28,927 --> 00:28:30,357
A proven candidate.

594
00:28:31,227 --> 00:28:34,057
A fearless candidate, unshaken by the nasty acts of sabotage.

595
00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:37,867
Please support our current vice president, Yang Won Dae.

596
00:28:39,237 --> 00:28:41,607
We promise only what we can actually deliver.

597
00:28:43,037 --> 00:28:45,077
High school only lasts for three years.

598
00:28:45,977 --> 00:28:47,847
Let's make the most of it with Yang Won Dae.

599
00:28:48,847 --> 00:28:51,647
Prepare for the school trip starting next year.

600
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,717
Pack your bags, fellow students!

601
00:28:53,947 --> 00:28:55,316
- Really?
- What the...

602
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:56,686
- Really?
- Lame.

603
00:28:56,687 --> 00:28:59,157
Place a sticker on your desired school trip destination,

604
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:01,886
and our candidate two will make sure it happens!

605
00:29:01,887 --> 00:29:04,497
Look at them taking credit when they're not paying for it.

606
00:29:05,057 --> 00:29:06,127
- Hey.
- Please take one.

607
00:29:06,697 --> 00:29:08,567
Did you all enjoy your meal?

608
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:10,467
- Yes!
- Yes!

609
00:29:10,767 --> 00:29:13,037
This bracelet can't guarantee...

610
00:29:13,737 --> 00:29:15,306
your safety and health.

611
00:29:15,307 --> 00:29:16,307
- Number 1.
- Number 1, okay?

612
00:29:16,308 --> 00:29:18,707
However, we are committed...

613
00:29:19,907 --> 00:29:22,407
to changing this bracelet into a premium smartwatch...

614
00:29:22,707 --> 00:29:24,547
for the entire student body!

615
00:29:24,647 --> 00:29:25,977
(Only one, only you)

616
00:29:26,417 --> 00:29:28,587
Five, six, seven, eight.

617
00:29:28,717 --> 00:29:30,517
- Only one, only you!
- Only one, only you!

618
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:31,687
- A premium school, - A premium school,

619
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:32,687
- a premium president!
- a premium president!

620
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:33,916
- Victory to Candidate 1!
- Victory to Candidate 1!

621
00:29:33,917 --> 00:29:34,926

- Kwak Sang Hyeon!
- Kwak Sang Hyeon!

623
00:29:36,727 --> 00:29:38,197
Thank you. It's candidate one.

624
00:29:38,727 --> 00:29:41,226
- Thank you.
- Kwak Sang Hyeon!

625
00:29:41,227 --> 00:29:44,327
Until this bracelet becomes a smartwatch!

626
00:29:44,697 --> 00:29:47,396
- Candidate 1!
- Candidate 1!

627
00:29:47,397 --> 00:29:49,106
- Candidate 1!
- Please take one.

628
00:29:49,107 --> 00:29:50,806
- Candidate 1!
- Here.

629
00:29:50,807 --> 00:29:52,306
- Candidate 1!
- Candidate 1!

630
00:29:52,307 --> 00:29:54,076
- Candidate 1!
- Candidate 1!

631
00:29:54,077 --> 00:29:55,447
- Candidate One!
- Please vote for him.

632
00:29:55,777 --> 00:29:56,947
Candidate One, okay?

633
00:30:01,247 --> 00:30:02,247
To...

634
00:30:02,787 --> 00:30:03,817
To those...

635
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:06,417
supporting...

636
00:30:06,957 --> 00:30:10,657
candidate one...

637
00:30:11,527 --> 00:30:13,426
- No, it's cute.
- At least he's trying.

638
00:30:13,427 --> 00:30:15,666
We will show you with actions!

639
00:30:15,667 --> 00:30:17,766
(Hold on tight to Kwak Sang Hyeon.)

640
00:30:17,767 --> 00:30:20,166
We will hold a head-shaving ceremony...

641
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:21,966
as a show of support from Kim Gi Jae,

642
00:30:21,967 --> 00:30:23,737
the PR manager of campaign team one.

643
00:30:24,037 --> 00:30:25,077
The hair clipper.

644
00:30:25,707 --> 00:30:26,807
Gosh.

645
00:30:29,907 --> 00:30:32,176
With all my might

646
00:30:32,177 --> 00:30:33,276
- Go for it!
- Yes!

647
00:30:33,277 --> 00:30:35,687
Always be kind

648
00:30:35,817 --> 00:30:37,117
Don't get cold feet.

649
00:30:37,317 --> 00:30:39,157
- What?
- You can do it.

650
00:30:39,217 --> 00:30:40,316
- Here I go.
- How cool.

651
00:30:40,317 --> 00:30:41,327
Okay.

652
00:30:41,857 --> 00:30:42,887
Nice!

653
00:30:44,597 --> 00:30:45,826
What the...

654
00:30:45,827 --> 00:30:47,966
- My gosh.
- That's crazy.

655
00:30:47,967 --> 00:30:49,867
- Keep going!
- Burn it!

656
00:30:50,027 --> 00:30:51,367
Burn his hair!

657
00:30:52,197 --> 00:30:53,767
- Cool!
- Good luck, Kwak Sang Hyeon!

658
00:30:54,397 --> 00:30:56,107
- Darn it.
- Nice!

659
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:57,637
Good job.

660
00:30:58,177 --> 00:30:59,406
Look at his bright smile.

661
00:30:59,407 --> 00:31:01,807
- Kim Gi Jae!
- Kim Gi Jae!

662
00:31:02,107 --> 00:31:03,646

- Kim Gi Jae!

(Live Support Ratings: Kwak Sang Hyeon versus Yang Won Dae)

667
00:31:12,457 --> 00:31:14,856
(Unite and fight!)

668
00:31:14,857 --> 00:31:15,886
(Rest in peace, democracy.)

669
00:31:15,887 --> 00:31:17,727
There was trespassing into...

670
00:31:17,757 --> 00:31:19,997
the Election Commission’s office and vandalism of campaign materials.

671
00:31:20,657 --> 00:31:23,266
The victims, Candidate Two Yang Won Dae and his campaign team,

672
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:25,267
staged a silent protest during lunchtime,

673
00:31:25,697 --> 00:31:27,336
holding a symbolic memorial service,

674
00:31:27,337 --> 00:31:29,137
declaring the death of democracy.

675
00:31:29,467 --> 00:31:31,636
In response, Campaign Team One...

676
00:31:31,637 --> 00:31:33,737
counterattacked with a head-shaving performance.

677
00:31:34,307 --> 00:31:37,207
However, more voters have started boycotting the upcoming election.

678
00:31:37,377 --> 00:31:38,776
All eyes are on the result of the vote,

679
00:31:38,777 --> 00:31:40,177
which is just around the corner.

680
00:31:40,717 --> 00:31:42,616
- Candidate 1!
- Candidate 1!

681
00:31:42,617 --> 00:31:44,317
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

682
00:31:44,817 --> 00:31:47,156
Please vote for Candidate One,

Kwak Sang Hyeon.

684
00:31:49,227 --> 00:31:50,287
Candidate One.

685
00:31:52,627 --> 00:31:53,657
Thank you.

686
00:31:54,767 --> 00:31:56,727
- Good luck!
- Let's do this!

687
00:31:56,927 --> 00:31:58,037
- We'll get going.
- I'm in your care.

688
00:31:58,367 --> 00:31:59,367
I'll vote for you.

689
00:31:59,368 --> 00:32:00,897
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

690
00:32:02,237 --> 00:32:03,337
Gosh, nice.

691
00:32:05,607 --> 00:32:07,307
- Noh Se!
- Was it you?

692
00:32:07,707 --> 00:32:08,907
Move!

693
00:32:09,107 --> 00:32:10,207
Hey, Noh Se.

694
00:32:10,647 --> 00:32:11,676
What is it?

695
00:32:11,677 --> 00:32:14,517
You should go to the cafeteria.

696
00:32:15,217 --> 00:32:16,687
- Why?
- That jerk...

697
00:32:17,317 --> 00:32:18,317
That real jerk.

698
00:32:18,557 --> 00:32:20,617
He's saying it's a conscience declaration.

699
00:32:21,687 --> 00:32:22,857
Anyway, just go.

700
00:32:23,857 --> 00:32:25,457
- Darn it.
- What's going on?

701
00:32:25,757 --> 00:32:27,256
- During a recent...
- You!

702
00:32:27,257 --> 00:32:28,967
After-school club activity,

703
00:32:29,667 --> 00:32:31,837
I committed a serious act of sexual harassment by drawing...

704
00:32:32,197 --> 00:32:33,566
a nude of Ha Yu Gyeong, who was on the piano at that time,

705
00:32:33,567 --> 00:32:35,806
and sharing it with 2 other 1st-year choir members,

706
00:32:35,807 --> 00:32:37,207
Oh Dae Hee and Noh Se Hoon.

707
00:32:38,807 --> 00:32:40,236
We later apologized to Ha Yu Gyeong...

708
00:32:40,237 --> 00:32:42,107
when she confronted us about it.

709
00:32:43,647 --> 00:32:45,417
Even so, I kept feeling a deep sense of guilt.

710
00:32:45,977 --> 00:32:47,717
That is why I'm coming forward publicly.

711
00:32:48,547 --> 00:32:49,616
What?

712
00:32:49,617 --> 00:32:50,686
- What's this?
- Please...

713
00:32:50,687 --> 00:32:52,857
