Thank you very much, Sang Hyeon.

185
00:09:12,699 --> 00:09:14,999
Come on. Can you stop being so polite?

186
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:16,428
It's making me cringe, you two.

187
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:18,139
Yes, stop being so polite.

188
00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:19,639
Just speak casually.

189
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,739
Just say, "Okay, bro."

190
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:25,209
Okay, bro.

191
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,419
Did you like the food?

192
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:32,149
It was so good.

193
00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:36,189
I think you're getting a call.

194
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:44,099
Why? Who is it?

195
00:09:45,129 --> 00:09:46,229
Should I answer it for you?

196
00:09:47,229 --> 00:09:49,429
No, I should answer it.

197
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:59,639
What is it? Is something going on?

198
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,809
Yes, it's kind of complicated.

199
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:10,388
- Hello?
- Hello, Won Dae.

200
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:12,719
Noh Se Hoon! Why didn't you pick up earlier?

201
00:10:13,189 --> 00:10:14,589
Do you know how many times I've called you?

202
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:17,829
I'm sorry.

203
00:10:18,499 --> 00:10:19,599
Where are you now?

204
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:22,229
I'm out at the moment.

205
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:25,298
Hey, we made a promise.

206
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:28,339
How could you do that without even consulting with me?

207
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:30,138
How could you betray me like this?

208
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:31,479
Will you never see me again?

209
00:10:31,909 --> 00:10:32,939
I'm sorry.

210
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:36,409
What's your reason? At least tell me your reason.

211
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:39,919
Come on.

212
00:10:42,219 --> 00:10:43,319
You won't tell me?

213
00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:46,019
- My reason?
- Yes.

214
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:48,989
I need to hear your reason to forgive you.

215
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:55,229
Forgive me?

216
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:56,868
Yes.

217
00:10:56,869 --> 00:10:59,569
Honestly, I wanted to run you over with my motorcycle.

218
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:06,109
Hurry up and tell me. Why did you do that?

219
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:09,349
Were you two always close?

220
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:12,479
Or did I wrong you or something?

221
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:16,819
Yes, that's right.

222
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:19,459
What did you say?

223
00:11:21,229 --> 00:11:22,889
Sang Hyeon and I...

224
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:25,199
were always pretty close.

225
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:27,199
Yes.

226
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:29,199
So, Sang Hyeon came to me...

227
00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:32,569
and said he had to team up with me.

228
00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:35,009
That's why...

229
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:37,779
I had no choice but to make such a decision.

230
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:45,979
I guess I was wrong about you.

231
00:11:48,189 --> 00:11:49,919
Anyway, I called...

232
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:51,889
to say we should get along.

233
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:55,529
So, don't be sneaky and screen my calls like that.

234
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:57,299
Okay?

235
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:01,999
Yes, I bet you're embarrassed.

236
00:12:02,669 --> 00:12:05,399
But what can you do? It's not like we'll never run into each other.

237
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:07,169
We're both in the choir.

238
00:12:07,609 --> 00:12:08,639
Yes.

239
00:12:09,409 --> 00:12:11,239
- We are.
- That's right.

240
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:13,709
So, stop avoiding me.

241
00:12:14,349 --> 00:12:15,649
You really are hurting my feelings here.

242
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:17,479
All right?

243
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:19,649
Yes.

244
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,519
Well understood.

245
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,659
- I'm off!
- Bye.

246
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:35,399
- Drive safe!
- Will do!

247
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:39,539
Noh Se, I had so much fun today.

248
00:12:39,869 --> 00:12:41,039
See you around.

249
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,109
See you, Mi Na.

250
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:48,249
Who's that guy?

251
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:49,779
Mi Na's brother.

252
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:55,519
He's her real brother.

253
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,119
Oh, he's her brother.

254
00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:03,329
Did you talk things out with Won Dae?

255
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:07,429
Well, yes. Kind of.

256
00:13:08,099 --> 00:13:09,129
I see.

257
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:12,439
It's your business, so I'm staying out of it.

258
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,239
It'd be weird for me to step in any way.

259
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:19,839
Anyway, get it sorted out.

260
00:13:21,849 --> 00:13:23,579
And get along with the other kids in the choir.

261
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:25,249
You know they're all my friends.

262
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:26,619
Yes, Sang Hyeon.

263
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:39,559
Oh, Sang Hyeon. Why would you give me this?

264
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:40,999
Just because.

265
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:43,839
- Sorry I can't buy you a new one.
- No.

266
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:45,668
You don't need to do this.

267
00:13:45,669 --> 00:13:47,639
I'll reset it now.

268
00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:49,309
Customize your settings on your way home.

269
00:13:49,939 --> 00:13:51,509
I'll bring you the charger tomorrow.

270
00:13:59,219 --> 00:14:00,619
Thanks, Sang Hyeon.

271
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:01,889
No, this is nothing.

272
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:04,359
I should thank you.

273
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:07,229
It must've been a difficult decision to make,

274
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:08,829
but because of me...

275
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,529
Here comes a taxi.

276
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:16,968
Yes. I'll be off, then.

277
00:14:16,969 --> 00:14:17,999
Okay, bye.

278
00:14:29,249 --> 00:14:30,919
I once heard...

279
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:34,189
that giving someone something you always carry with you...

280
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:37,719
is a really meaningful and personal thing to do.

281
00:14:39,989 --> 00:14:41,159
Maybe...

282
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:44,059
Sang Hyeon is even a better person than I thought.

283
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:56,439
This is so cool.

284
00:15:09,219 --> 00:15:11,219
I heard you recommended me to Won Dae.

285
00:15:12,189 --> 00:15:13,489
- Yes.
- Why?

286
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:15,429
You are...

287
00:15:16,489 --> 00:15:18,558
the most popular girl in our grade and...

288
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:19,559
And?

289
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:22,229
Why did you suddenly betray us?

290
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:25,598
Well, I didn't betray you guys.

291
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:26,699
Then what is this?

292
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:32,639
What are you going to do about the choir?

293
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:35,509
- What do you mean?
- Will you stay in the choir?

294
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:37,949
Yes, I'm staying.

295
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:41,189
You just do whatever you feel like, don't you?

296
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:45,489
The election and the choir...

297
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:47,729
are two separate things.

298
00:15:48,859 --> 00:15:50,699
Okay, good luck.

299
00:15:54,499 --> 00:15:55,629
What are you two doing here?

300
00:15:56,329 --> 00:15:57,769
Goodness. Nothing.

301
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:01,939
I'm off.

302
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:09,209
Noh Se, that fool.

303
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:11,579
He looks like he has a lot on his mind.

304
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,689
Was he always like that?

305
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:15,549
Doing whatever he feels like? What's with him?

306
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:17,189
No.

307
00:16:18,189 --> 00:16:19,259
Noh Se...

308
00:16:19,989 --> 00:16:21,089
He's really...

309
00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:25,259
He's just too ridiculously nice. That's why.

310
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:27,199
What does that even mean?

311
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:28,828
You could just say he's nice.

312
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:30,339
What does it mean to be too ridiculously nice?

313
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:33,808
I mean, he's nice. Like, too nice.

314
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:34,839
Whatever.

315
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:37,139
Anyway, I'm totally disappointed in Noh Se Hoon.

316
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:40,109
Hey, Park Ji Hun! What are you doing?

317
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:41,479
Hi, Yu Gyeong.

318
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:43,949
Hey! How did it go, you two?

319
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:46,049
It went well. It was perfect!

320
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:47,949
Seriously, thanks. We owe you one.

321
00:16:48,289 --> 00:16:49,748
- Don't worry about it.
- Oh, right.

322
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:51,088
Let's go to Hyeon Su's birthday party together.

323
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:52,288
We'll have fried chicken.

324
00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:53,959
What? Fried chicken?

325
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:55,788
- You have to come.
- You must.

326
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:57,499
- See you later!
- Okay, see you.

327
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,699
I guess you have a lot of friends.

328
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:02,799
What?

329
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:07,639
Oh, that's because I've lived in this neighbourhood for 17 years.

330
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:10,009
I'm in like 63 group chats.

331
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:13,539
Park Ji Hun.

332
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:15,809
Then,

333
00:17:16,879 --> 00:17:19,519
have you ever been class president before?

334
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:22,619
What?

335
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:25,189
(Youngjin High School)

336
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:28,389
Hey, Noh Se.

337
00:17:29,189 --> 00:17:31,559
Even if you become student council vice president,

338
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,558
that doesn't mean you're no longer part of our class.

339
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:35,729
- That's right.
- Exactly.

340
00:17:36,229 --> 00:17:38,539
I don't care whether you're VP or the president of Korea.

341
00:17:38,869 --> 00:17:40,409
I'm still your class president, okay?

342
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,439
- Yes, you're right.
- Never forget that.

343
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:45,139
I'm the one in charge here.

344
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:46,578
- I'll remember that.
- Good.

345
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:47,909
What are you doing, you two?

346
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:50,149
Hey, Jo Han Byeol. Are you two going out or something?

347
00:17:50,379 --> 00:17:52,218
Are you all excited that he might become VP?

348
00:17:52,219 --> 00:17:53,989
Stop overreacting, Kim Gi Jae.

349
00:17:54,719 --> 00:17:55,719
Hey.

350
00:17:56,219 --> 00:17:57,318
What's this?

351
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:58,558
- Guys, gather around!
- What is it?

352
00:17:58,559 --> 00:17:59,658
Where did you get this?

353
00:17:59,659 --> 00:18:02,089
Look at you. You're wearing a smart band.

354
00:18:02,229 --> 00:18:04,098
- I got it as a gift.
- How much is this?

355
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:06,099
- A gift?
- It's probably over 1,000 dollars.

356
00:18:06,659 --> 00:18:09,068
My gosh. This punk gets gifts now.

357
00:18:09,069 --> 00:18:10,999
- Isn't this a bribe?
- A bribe?

358
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:13,369
- Hey, did you take bribes?
- No, I did not.

359
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:15,769
- Never take bribes.
- Hey, hold on. What the...

360
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:17,939
- This is mine!
- Nice.

361
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:20,578
Hey! It suits you.

362
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:22,309
- It's mine, right?
- Yes, it suits you.

363
00:18:22,379 --> 00:18:23,648
- Can I try it on?
- Excuse me, sorry.

364
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:24,748
- You want to try it on?
- Oh, my.

365
00:18:24,749 --> 00:18:25,878
- Hello.
- Hi, Sang Hyeon!

366
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:27,189
- I want to try it on too.
- Let me try it on.

367
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:30,189
- Hello.
- Hi, Sang Hyeon.

368
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:31,619
- Hello.
- Hello.

369
00:18:32,289 --> 00:18:33,389
Hi, Sang Hyeon.

370
00:18:33,489 --> 00:18:35,728
Hey, Se Hoon. I brought the charger.

371
00:18:35,729 --> 00:18:36,859
- You know, later...
- Sang Hyeon.

372
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,759
- Hello.
- Hi.

373
00:18:43,729 --> 00:18:46,499
- Is that yours?
- No, I was just trying it on.

374
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:51,579
- Don't do that again.
- Sorry?

375
00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:53,739
You'd better not do that again,

376
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:55,579
ever.

377
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,119
Oh, okay.

378
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:03,619
- I'll see you in the evening.
- Okay.

379
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:06,018
- Bye.
- Bye.

380
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,128
- Bye, Sang Hyeon.
- Have a great day!

381
00:19:08,129 --> 00:19:09,229
He's really good-looking.

382
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:12,759
My gosh. Did you guys see his shoes?

383
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:14,568
How did he get those expensive shoes?

384
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:15,698
Sang Hyeon is seriously so cool.

385
00:19:15,699 --> 00:19:17,338
Seriously, stop overreacting, Kim Gi Jae.

386
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:19,539
- I saw your legs give out on you.
- What? That's nonsense.

387
00:19:19,699 --> 00:19:20,708
- Hey.
- How much is this again?

388
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:22,139
- Good for you, Noh Se.
- Can I try it on?

389
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:24,609
Come on.

390
00:19:24,939 --> 00:19:26,709
- I got this.
- I brought one for you too.

391
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:28,978
- Let's go.
- Hey, we'll take care of this.

392
00:19:28,979 --> 00:19:30,819
- Thanks.
- Did you get everything?

393
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:33,619
Se Hoon, so I thought about it.

394
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:35,718
Wouldn't it be better to meet up with Won Dae...

395
00:19:35,719 --> 00:19:37,149
and get it sorted out in person?

396
00:19:38,189 --> 00:19:39,319
You should end things on a good note.

397
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:51,139
I was so annoyed.

398
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:52,999
He betrayed me like a sneaky rat.

399
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,309
He really let me down.

400
00:19:55,709 --> 00:19:58,509
Just let it go, Won Dae. Try to look on the bright side.

401
00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:00,339
We got to weed out the nuisance right from the start.

402
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:02,248
If he'd stayed on the team,

403
00:20:02,249 --> 00:20:03,849
we'd be even more annoyed down the line.

404
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,549
But I really can't forgive him.

405
00:20:07,889 --> 00:20:09,018
Just let it go.

406
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:11,159
Let's hurry up and find a new candidate who can replace him.

407
00:20:13,719 --> 00:20:14,828
How about this guy?

408
00:20:14,829 --> 00:20:17,229
I thought they'd be super down because of me,

409
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:19,958
- You? Come on.
- but they don't even seem bothered.

410
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:21,069
What are you, a physiognomist?

411
00:20:22,229 --> 00:20:23,599
Well, then...

412
00:20:24,739 --> 00:20:25,839
Nam Gyeong Tae?

413
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,539
Gyeong Tae is good to me.

414
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:28,809
Come on.

415
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:31,139
Gyeong Tae wouldn't be a good fit.

416
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:35,179
Someone got on my radar today.

417
00:20:36,579 --> 00:20:37,619
Who?

418
00:20:39,819 --> 00:20:41,119
It's not someone on this list.

419
00:20:46,589 --> 00:20:48,529
Hey, it looks so funny.

420
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,899
- Hold on.
- Hey, wait.

421
00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:54,499
Isn't it hilarious?

422
00:20:55,269 --> 00:20:56,628
- Oh, boy.
- Right, hey.

423
00:20:56,629 --> 00:20:57,938
- What?
- Yoon Jeong Hui's mom...

424
00:20:57,939 --> 00:21:00,098
called and lashed out at our PE teacher,

425
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:01,409
demanding they take responsibility for her grades.

426
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:02,839
Why is that the teacher's responsibility?

427
00:21:03,069 --> 00:21:05,639
She's just extremely unathletic.

428
00:21:05,879 --> 00:21:08,009
Hey, why is she running in the election anyway?

429
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,079
It really doesn't suit her.

430
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,308
She was standing next to Kwak Sang Hyeon,

431
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:11,779
but it looked like she was sitting.

432
00:21:12,819 --> 00:21:14,919
Is she so short because only her head grew?

433
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:17,818
What's the point of being smart if she has such a terrible personality?

434
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:21,089
Hey, she didn't pass the Mensa test because of her nasty personality.

435
00:21:21,389 --> 00:21:22,489
Stop talking nonsense.

436
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:23,999
Mensa doesn't care about your personality.

437
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,259
- For real, you brat.
- It is true!

438
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:29,068
Hey, make way.

439
00:21:29,069 --> 00:21:30,669
- We're blocking the whole street.
- Oh, okay.

440
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:38,009
- Hey, it's him.
- Noh Se Hoon in Class Four?

441
00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:40,208
- He's on Yoon Jeong Hui's team.
- For real?

442
00:21:40,209 --> 00:21:41,548
Kwak Sang Hyeon is really something.

443
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:44,349
He teamed up with losers so he could steal all the spotlight.

444
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:47,249
Hey, he can hear us.

445
00:21:49,149 --> 00:21:50,149
My goodness.

446
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:55,528
Noh Se, why are you so busy these days? What are you up to?

447
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:57,329
Hey, I'm out at the moment.

448
00:21:57,529 --> 00:21:59,329
Where are you? Let's meet.

449
00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:01,199
Why? What's up?

450
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,368
No, we should talk in person.

451
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:05,239
- You don't have time now?
- Right now...

452
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:07,298
I'll call you later.

453
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:08,869
When? Call me back right away...

454
00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:17,279
This one, please.

455
00:22:20,349 --> 00:22:21,919
- Hi, Sang Hyeon.
- You're here.

456
00:22:23,389 --> 00:22:25,888
Does your family own this place?

457
00:22:25,889 --> 00:22:26,918
Yes.

458
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:28,589
Come here anytime until you graduate from college.

459
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:30,459
Until I graduate from college?

460
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,199
Many college students come here.

461
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:35,699
I should go to college first.

462
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:38,839
- Right.
- Yes.

463
00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:51,019
The basement has a second floor?

464
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:53,819
Come on. It's no big deal.

465
00:22:55,089 --> 00:22:56,419
Here, this is your room.

466
00:23:01,889 --> 00:23:02,929
This is awesome.

467
00:23:04,659 --> 00:23:06,099
The soundproofing in the room is solid,

468
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:09,269
so you won't need earphones when watching online lectures.

469
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:12,669
But you can't watch porn here.

470
00:23:14,069 --> 00:23:15,109
Got it.

471
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:17,239
And...

472
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:19,709
Here.

473
00:23:20,109 --> 00:23:21,979
This is like a credit card here.

474
00:23:22,249 --> 00:23:23,409
Use it whenever you need.

475
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:27,749
Oh, right.

476
00:23:27,889 --> 00:23:29,448
All the managers here...

477
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,089
are Seoul National University students on leave,

478
00:23:31,419 --> 00:23:32,719
so feel free to ask them questions.

479
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:34,389
Think of them as your tutors.

480
00:23:34,629 --> 00:23:35,659
Okay.

481
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:43,629
This is you, right?

482
00:23:44,699 --> 00:23:45,699
Yes.

483
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:48,139
I did it for some pocket money.

484
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:51,279
Isn't that pose so lame, though?

485
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:55,449
- Let's go.
- Okay.

486
00:24:00,819 --> 00:24:02,189
Will Yoon Jeong Hui come here too?

487
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,119
Only when we have our meetings.

488
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:05,589
She prefers to work from home.

489
00:24:08,329 --> 00:24:09,359
Anyway,

490
00:24:09,989 --> 00:24:11,699
this is our hideout starting today.

491
00:24:13,199 --> 00:24:15,569
- Make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

492
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:19,669
Jeong Hui is here too.

493
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,009
Should we get started now that everyone's here?

494
00:24:27,379 --> 00:24:28,409
Sure.

495
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:33,349
From now on, it's very important that we get along with everyone.

496
00:24:33,749 --> 00:24:35,849
Neither of you is the type to fight with friends.

497
00:24:36,449 --> 00:24:37,489
- That's right.
- That's right.

498
00:24:38,219 --> 00:24:42,029
Jeong Hui, you don't really laugh a lot, right?

499
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:43,989
I laugh when something's funny.

500
00:24:44,329 --> 00:24:45,329
You do?

501
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:56,108
- Funny, right?
- That fake smile.

502
00:24:56,109 --> 00:24:58,009
See? It's nice to see you smile.

503
00:24:58,379 --> 00:25:00,639
- She really irks me.
- All right.

504
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:03,149
Okay, then shall we go through our campaign pledges?

505
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,689
This concerns our studies,

506
00:25:08,749 --> 00:25:09,849
and this is about the school environment.

507
00:25:10,249 --> 00:25:11,919
Is it because both of you get good grades?

508
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:13,319
These are great.

509
00:25:15,089 --> 00:25:16,629
Did you guys do well on your last exam?

510
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:19,129
Yes, I did about the same as I normally do.

511
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:20,999
And you, Se Hoon?

512
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:23,629
- I also did...
- I heard you bombed your exam.

513
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:26,669
What is her problem with me?

514
00:25:27,869 --> 00:25:29,769
And how did she know I bombed my exam?

515
00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:33,508
Oh, is she perhaps interested in me...

516
00:25:33,509 --> 00:25:35,778
Don't get the wrong idea. I have no interest in you at all.

517
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:37,778
I just happened to overhear the teachers' conversation.

518
00:25:37,779 --> 00:25:38,848
I didn't say anything.

519
00:25:38,849 --> 00:25:40,318
It's written all over your face.

520
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:41,588
This is how my face always looks.

521
00:25:41,589 --> 00:25:42,649
I didn't ask.

522
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:45,589
Seriously, you two look so cute together.

523
00:25:45,859 --> 00:25:47,288
Come on. Stop saying that.

524
00:25:47,289 --> 00:25:49,929
Hey, why are you getting worked up? I'm more offended.

525
00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:54,469
Sang Hyeon, let's continue.

526
00:25:57,529 --> 00:25:58,569
Hey, Se Hoon.

527
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:00,839
It's about numbers 2 and 3.

528
00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:04,679
You didn't prepare these pledges with Yang Won Dae, did you?

529
00:26:05,109 --> 00:26:06,939
No, I didn't. They're completely different.

530
00:26:07,309 --> 00:26:08,379
Are they completely different?

531
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,209
How are they different?

532
00:26:10,879 --> 00:26:11,879
As for that...

533
00:26:13,749 --> 00:26:14,789
This is...

534
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:17,018
a screenshot of the messages we exchanged.

535
00:26:17,019 --> 00:26:18,318
You can take a look.

536
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:21,029
With Yang Won Dae? Is it okay for me to take a look?

537
00:26:21,629 --> 00:26:23,329
Well, I think it's fine.

538
00:26:24,089 --> 00:26:25,099
Okay.

539
00:26:26,829 --> 00:26:28,298
(Choir Captain Yang Won Dae)

540
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:29,629
(1. Aid for after-school activities, Shouldn't we be more specific?)

541
00:26:30,169 --> 00:26:32,499
Since Won Dae has experience from last year,

542
00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:34,038
he's good.

543
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:35,639
There are more screenshots.

544
00:26:35,809 --> 00:26:36,839
Really?

545
00:26:37,209 --> 00:26:38,239
Let me take a look.

546
00:26:39,509 --> 00:26:40,678
(Candidate Recruitment...)

547
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:41,849
(for the Student President and Vice President Election)

548
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:46,849
Come on.

549
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:48,549
Stop it.

550
00:26:52,419 --> 00:26:53,618
Do you have...

551
00:26:53,619 --> 00:26:55,789
any inconveniences or suggestions regarding school life?

552
00:26:56,659 --> 00:26:57,729
For me, it's that thing.

553
00:26:58,129 --> 00:26:59,599
I don't want to listen to the lunchtime radio.

554
00:26:59,829 --> 00:27:02,499
I know. It's so loud and distracting.

555
00:27:03,129 --> 00:27:05,369
Not only that, their dance is subpar.

556
00:27:05,639 --> 00:27:07,708
"To create an academic atmosphere..."

557
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,769
"A new paradigm for the lunchtime radio show?"

558
00:27:11,409 --> 00:27:12,609
The title is quite nice.

559
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,009
Okay. Anything else?

560
00:27:15,949 --> 00:27:18,549
Can you give us one of these each?

561
00:27:18,879 --> 00:27:21,319
I can't do that for all the students.

562
00:27:21,719 --> 00:27:22,749
Well,

563
00:27:23,189 --> 00:27:25,089
wouldn't it be possible for Kwak Sang Hyeon?

564
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:26,759
I'm sorry,

565
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:29,289
but would you stop using such a casual tone with him?

566
00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:33,299
Then you should start using a polite tone with me.

567
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:34,699
Hey, Noh Se.

568
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:37,129
Don't miss the choir meeting after school today.

569
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:39,099
You know that we're voting for the next choir captain, right?

570
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:40,299
Yes, I know.

571
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:43,469
I'm in your care.

572
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,309
Please support me, okay?

573
00:27:45,709 --> 00:27:47,308
There isn't anything I can do.

574
00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:48,949
Just recommend me.

575
00:27:49,349 --> 00:27:51,419
Then I'll do the rest.

576
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:53,749
- Okay.
- Noh Se!

577
00:27:53,949 --> 00:27:55,488
- Hey, Park Ji.
- Jae Seok. Hi.

578
00:27:55,489 --> 00:27:56,689
- Hey.
- Hi.

579
00:27:57,349 --> 00:27:58,389
Hey.

580
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:02,659
How did you suddenly become a popular guy?

581
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:04,959
- Good afternoon, guys.
- It isn't very good for me.

582
00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:07,029
I must solve this mystery.

583
00:28:07,699 --> 00:28:09,369
Hey, you should get to the bottom of it.

584
00:28:10,469 --> 00:28:11,669
Where have you been?

585
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:13,038
You were nowhere to be seen.

586
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,939
I told you that we should talk...

587
00:28:15,909 --> 00:28:16,939
What?

588
00:28:17,339 --> 00:28:19,239
What's that? When did you buy it?

589
00:28:19,709 --> 00:28:21,078
Student president candidate Kwak Sang Hyeon...

590
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:23,379
bestowed it on him as a present.

591
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:24,648
It's an electronic bracelet.

592
00:28:24,649 --> 00:28:26,319
This model has the top specifications.

593
00:28:26,449 --> 00:28:27,619
But I don't think it's new.

594
00:28:27,719 --> 00:28:29,149
To be specific, it's secondhand.

595
00:28:30,189 --> 00:28:32,259
Still, it's insanely cool.

596
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,589
Stop it.

597
00:28:34,289 --> 00:28:35,389
What did you want to talk about?

598
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:37,559
Oh, I forgot. Hey, come on out for a second.

599
00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:39,399
You bastard!

600
00:28:42,499 --> 00:28:43,499
What's going on?

601
00:28:43,499 --> 00:28:44,499
- Hey!
- My goodness.

602
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,769
Nam Gyeong Tae!

603
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:48,069
What kind of a bastard does something like this?

604
00:28:48,369 --> 00:28:49,739
- What?
- What's going on?

605
00:28:51,609 --> 00:28:52,679
What?

606
00:28:53,579 --> 00:28:55,879
Hey, what's this piece of trash?

607
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:57,348
What's that?

608
00:28:57,349 --> 00:28:58,948
Answer me, you piece of trash.

609
00:28:58,949 --> 00:29:01,019
Don't roll those fish eyes of yours.

610
00:29:01,149 --> 00:29:02,519
- What?
- Oh, this?

611
00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:05,359
Hey, Nam Gyeong Tae. Are you a piece of trash?

612
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:09,188
I wondered what he always did in the back.

613
00:29:09,189 --> 00:29:11,459
- Was this what he was drawing?
- I expected that much.

614
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:14,299
- This isn't mine.
- Give me a break.

615
00:29:14,469 --> 00:29:15,769
Can't you see your name in the back?

616
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:21,139
My name doesn't necessarily mean that it's mine.

617
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,269
Ms. Ah Yeong already took a picture.

618
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:26,079
Once she compares the handwriting, you're done for.

619
00:29:27,339 --> 00:29:29,309
- He's ruined.
- Oh, my.

620
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:33,218
Why would you compare it...

621
00:29:33,219 --> 00:29:35,148
to my handwriting only?

622
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:37,789
It could be anyone who was in the Music Room that way.

623
00:29:38,259 --> 00:29:39,759
I can't believe it.

624
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:43,289
Why do you think it's from the Music Room?

625
00:29:44,729 --> 00:29:46,299
We never said that.

626
00:29:49,069 --> 00:29:50,798
She's a detective!

627
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:51,938
She's cool!

628
00:29:51,939 --> 00:29:55,008
You're ruined, Pervert Gyeong Tae.

629
00:29:55,009 --> 00:29:57,339
Why would you live that way, Gyeong Tae?

630
00:29:57,979 --> 00:29:58,979
Let's go.

631
00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:00,779
Make sure to hire a lawyer.

632
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:04,649
- Pervert Gyeong Tae!
- Pervert Gyeong Tae!

633
00:30:04,849 --> 00:30:06,118
- Pervert Gyeong Tae!
- Pervert Gyeong Tae!

634
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:07,518
- Pervert Gyeong Tae!
- For goodness' sake.

635
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:08,749
- Pervert Gyeong Tae!
- Hey, Noh Se.

636
00:30:08,889 --> 00:30:11,159
- Pervert Gyeong Tae!
- Let's talk later, okay?

637
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:13,258
- I have a choir meeting.
- Come on.

638
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:15,058
- We really need to talk, okay?
- Pervert Gyeong Tae

639
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:17,059
- Pervert Gyeong Tae!
- Pervert Gyeong Tae!

640
00:30:17,229 --> 00:30:18,758
- Pervert Gyeong Tae!
- What does he want to talk about?

641
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:20,098
- Pervert Gyeong Tae!
- Pervert Gyeong Tae!

642
00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:21,628
How many types of phonological changes are there?

643
00:30:21,629 --> 00:30:22,798
- Four.
- Four.

645
00:30:25,069 --> 00:30:26,339

647
00:30:36,149 --> 00:30:37,209
Nam Gyeong Tae.

648
00:30:37,579 --> 00:30:39,549
You're lucky that you didn't receive disciplinary action.

649
00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:41,249
- Han Byeol.
- Yes?

650
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:44,018
Let's get him an ankle monitor or a neck monitor.

651
00:30:44,019 --> 00:30:46,358
- I already ordered one.
- She doesn't disappoint.

652
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:48,029
Noh Se, just give him yours.

653
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:56,569
Gyeong Tae, it's expensive.

654
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:00,498
The class ends here today.

655
00:31:00,499 --> 00:31:02,038
Study for the next quiz.

656
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:03,069
- Okay.
- Okay.

657
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:05,278
Work hard.

658
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,438
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

659
00:31:06,439 --> 00:31:07,509
We love you.

660
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:12,249
Noh Se, are you out of your freaking mind?

661
00:31:12,449 --> 00:31:13,449
What did I do?

662
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:15,089
Why did you put it in the music file?

663
00:31:15,849 --> 00:31:17,989
You did it on purpose to ruin my life, right?

664
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:19,559
What nonsense are you spouting?

665
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:21,529
If that isn't it,

666
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:23,359
did you give it to Ha Yu Gyeong intentionally?

667
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:25,628
Do you think I'm crazy? Why would I do that?

668
00:31:25,629 --> 00:31:27,659
Guys, friends shouldn't be like that.

669
00:31:28,369 --> 00:31:29,698
If you're going to fight, do it for real.

670
00:31:29,699 --> 00:31:30,799
Throw the first punch.

671
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:34,499
I forgot.

672
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,409
I forgot and left it in the file.

673
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:41,749
How am I supposed to believe anything a traitor says?

674
00:31:42,909 --> 00:31:44,949
What? What did you say just now?

675
00:31:45,619 --> 00:31:47,679
You backstabbed Won Dae, didn't you?

676
00:31:48,749 --> 00:31:50,749
You betrayed him like a rat.

677
00:31:53,019 --> 00:31:54,019
Stop it already.

678
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:56,028
You don't know anything.

679
00:31:56,029 --> 00:31:57,659
That's right. Stop it already.

680
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,198
If you guys aren't going to fight, stop it already.

681
00:32:00,199 --> 00:32:01,298
This is so boring.

682
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:03,098
Between a rat and a pervert, who will win?

683
00:32:03,099 --> 00:32:05,439
Doesn't the pervert have a better chance due to size?

684
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:08,638
- Seriously.
- Who will win?

685
00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:10,568
- Are you leaving?
- He's running away.

686
00:32:10,569 --> 00:32:11,708
The rat is running away.

687
00:32:11,709 --> 00:32:13,108
- Hey.
- The rat is running away.

688
00:32:13,109 --> 00:32:14,539
- Be quiet.
- Stop it.

689
00:32:15,449 --> 00:32:16,449
Idiot.

690
00:32:16,849 --> 00:32:18,418
He really is a rat.

691
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:19,419
All right.

692
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,178
The pervert won.

693
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:22,588
- How boring.
- Hey.

694
00:32:22,589 --> 00:32:24,489
- Gyeong Tae, you won.
- The pervert won.

695
00:32:36,699 --> 00:32:37,699
I'm sorry.

696
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:42,669
Apologize to her properly from the bottom of your heart.

697
00:32:55,049 --> 00:32:56,089
I'm sorry.

698
00:32:57,619 --> 00:32:59,689
It was too much.

699
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,129

00:33:52,939 --> 00:33:54,479
Please recommend anyone who will be a good fit.

719
00:33:55,249 --> 00:33:56,949
I want Won Dae to remain as the captain.

720
00:33:58,979 --> 00:34:00,479
- Recommendations?
- Just say that you'll do it.

721
00:34:01,219 --> 00:34:03,049
It looks like everyone is reading the room.

722
00:34:03,789 --> 00:34:05,419
Then I'll recommend someone first.

723
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:09,889
You might be surprised, but this person is a good fit.

724
00:34:10,029 --> 00:34:12,459
- It must be you.
- I've watched for a while.

725
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,559
This person was always punctual...

726
00:34:15,029 --> 00:34:17,029
with our meetings and clean ups.

727
00:34:18,999 --> 00:34:20,039
Se Hoon.

728
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:21,939
He was the only one.

729
00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:25,809
Noh Se, come on.

730
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:27,709
I'm not saying that clean ups are important.

731
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:30,279
"How much can one dedicate himself to the club?"

732
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:34,079
"How responsible can one be with the small promises?"

733
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:35,949
I'm talking about those issues.

734
00:34:37,019 --> 00:34:40,689
I think someone like that should lead the choir.

735
00:34:41,589 --> 00:34:42,589
That's all.

736
00:34:42,859 --> 00:34:44,229
Does anyone else have a recommendation?

737
00:34:45,129 --> 00:34:47,529
Se Hoon, you were about to raise your hand.

738
00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:48,829
What?

739
00:34:53,939 --> 00:34:54,939
It's nothing.

740
00:34:57,309 --> 00:34:59,008
You guys are rivals...

741
00:34:59,009 --> 00:35:00,479
for the student council election, right?

742
00:35:00,979 --> 00:35:01,979
Yes.

743
00:35:02,409 --> 00:35:04,409
But the student council and choir are two different things.

744
00:35:06,149 --> 00:35:08,019
- All right!
- You're cool!

745
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,148
You're so cool.

746
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,149
He doesn't disappoint.

747
00:35:12,259 --> 00:35:13,289
How nice.

748
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:15,589
He has a point.

749
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:18,129
They're two different things.

750
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:20,199
Any other recommendations?

751
00:35:23,169 --> 00:35:25,869
Se Hoon, let's hear a few words from you.

752
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:29,508
- What?
- Okay!

753
00:35:29,509 --> 00:35:30,638
Don't just sit there, Se Hoon.

754
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:32,709
- Come on out.
- That's right.

755
00:35:32,939 --> 00:35:33,939
Let's go.

756
00:35:35,709 --> 00:35:37,109
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

757
00:35:37,709 --> 00:35:38,878
Come on out.

758
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:40,878
- Let's go.
- Come on out.

759
00:35:40,879 --> 00:35:42,218
Let's go.

760
00:35:42,219 --> 00:35:44,519
- Let's go.
- You're cool, Noh Se Hoon.

761
00:35:46,359 --> 00:35:47,788
Let's do this.

762
00:35:47,789 --> 00:35:48,889
Why are you terrified?

763
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:50,389
See?

764
00:35:51,759 --> 00:35:53,729
See? I forgave you.

765
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:15,519
I'm...

766
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:17,789
very ashamed.

767
00:36:18,789 --> 00:36:20,019
I'm ashamed...

768
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:22,889
because I wasn't the only one who did that.

769
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:27,759
I'm very thankful for Won Dae's words.

770
00:36:28,899 --> 00:36:29,929
However,

771
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:32,599
if I get nominated for such reasons,

772
00:36:33,269 --> 00:36:35,509
I'll feel bad for other members.

773
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:39,879
The choir hasn't been going well...

774
00:36:40,379 --> 00:36:41,749
because of me.

775
00:36:42,379 --> 00:36:44,878
I think it's thanks to the members who have put in the effort...

776
00:36:44,879 --> 00:36:46,519
in their respective positions.

777
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,819
The one who organizes the music sheets,

778
00:36:49,219 --> 00:36:50,649
the one who distributes snacks,

779
00:36:51,419 --> 00:36:53,089
the one who is in charge of the group messages,

780
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:54,759
the one who edits videos,

781
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:56,159
and...

782
00:36:57,689 --> 00:36:59,029
the one who plays the piano.

783
00:36:59,929 --> 00:37:01,529
I don't think it's the effort of 1 or 2 people...

784
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:04,229
that keeps the choir going.

785
00:37:05,069 --> 00:37:06,139
In that sense,

786
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:09,939
Won Dae's words were a bit disappointing.

787
00:37:12,909 --> 00:37:14,139
And I have a fatal flaw.

788
00:37:15,249 --> 00:37:16,479
I'm tone-deaf.

789
00:37:17,609 --> 00:37:19,949
- He's pretty tone-deaf.
- That's right.

790
00:37:20,619 --> 00:37:22,919
Thus, I'm not suitable to become the captain.

791
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:24,389
Instead,

792
00:37:25,219 --> 00:37:28,889
I'd like to nominate the most fitting candidate.

793
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:32,099
He can sing well.

794
00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:34,529
He has a lot of interest in music.

795
00:37:35,669 --> 00:37:39,999
Most importantly, he has passion and loyalty.

796
00:37:41,169 --> 00:37:42,209
I...

797
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:46,479
nominate Yu Ui Jun as the next choir captain.

798
00:37:48,909 --> 00:37:50,948
- That's right.
- Ui Jun, it's you.

799
00:37:50,949 --> 00:37:52,219
- Come on out.
- Yu Ui Jun!

800
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:53,948
- Yu Ui Jun!
- Ui Jun, let's go!

801
00:37:53,949 --> 00:37:57,589
- Yu Ui Jun!
- Yu Ui Jun!

802
00:37:57,919 --> 00:37:59,059
- Yu Ui Jun!
- Yu Ui Jun!

803
00:37:59,259 --> 00:38:00,519
- Let's go!
- Yu Ui Jun!

804
00:38:05,399 --> 00:38:06,428
Thank you.

805
00:38:06,429 --> 00:38:08,929
Firstly, I'd like to thank Se Hoon for nominating me.

806
00:38:09,399 --> 00:38:11,469
His speech moved me so much.

807
00:38:11,899 --> 00:38:13,399
If you give me a chance,

808
00:38:13,669 --> 00:38:16,368
I'll show utmost dedication.

809
00:38:16,369 --> 00:38:18,379
With Yang Won Dae,

810
00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:20,478
I'll enter the student council election.

811
00:38:20,479 --> 00:38:21,778
(With Yang Won Dae, I'll enter the student council election.)

812
00:38:21,779 --> 00:38:23,479
It's quite sudden,

813
00:38:23,909 --> 00:38:25,648
but my homeroom teacher and my parents think...

814
00:38:25,649 --> 00:38:27,579
that it'll be a good experience.

815
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:30,289
In any case, call me after the choir.

816
00:38:30,819 --> 00:38:32,459
- Let's talk.
- I, Yu Ui Jun,

817
00:38:32,789 --> 00:38:34,719
will dedicate myself fully...

818
00:38:35,289 --> 00:38:37,059
to the choir.

819
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:40,429
- Yes!
- You're cool!

820
00:38:41,059 --> 00:38:42,798
Let's go, Yu Ui Jun!

821
00:38:42,799 --> 00:38:45,799
(Choir captain election)

822
00:38:56,349 --> 00:38:58,009
I first joined the choir...

823
00:38:58,279 --> 00:39:00,249
because there were many pretty girls.

824
00:39:02,649 --> 00:39:04,189
Even though I was tone-deaf,

825
00:39:04,589 --> 00:39:06,559
I loved how my mistake wasn't noticeable...

826
00:39:06,859 --> 00:39:08,928
when I stood next to the loud members.

827
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:09,989
(Certificate of Award)

828
00:39:10,589 --> 00:39:11,659
Instead,

829
00:39:12,259 --> 00:39:13,959
I decided to take the initiative.

830
00:39:15,229 --> 00:39:18,439
I thought that was the least I could do for the choir.

831
00:39:20,469 --> 00:39:21,809
I'm happy...

832
00:39:22,409 --> 00:39:25,679
because today's applause felt like praise for my effort.

833
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:32,179
But from now on, I won't be praised for my effort only.

834
00:39:35,089 --> 00:39:36,289
I'll bow out...

835
00:39:37,219 --> 00:39:38,819
before the applause fades.

836
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:43,489
(Club Withdrawal Application)

837
00:43:11,729 --> 00:43:18,909
(I Am A Running Mate)
