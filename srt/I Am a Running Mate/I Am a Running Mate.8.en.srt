I wasn't.

182
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:15,998
Do you perhaps have...

183
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:17,829
I don't have feelings for you. Shut your mouth.

184
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:21,939
Vice Presidents.

185
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:24,069
- Go ahead.
- We'll get going.

186
00:10:24,469 --> 00:10:25,909
Congratulations to both of you.

187
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:27,339
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

188
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,449
Everyone got so excited. I had to stay in the back for a bit.

189
00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:32,449
Oh, right.

190
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:34,579
- I'm returning the tie.
- Right.

191
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:36,819
Keep it as a souvenir.

192
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:38,049
- I'd appreciate your help.
- Sang Hyeon!

193
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,318
- Congratulations, Sang Hyeon.
- Congratulations.

194
00:10:40,319 --> 00:10:41,319
Thank you.

195
00:10:41,619 --> 00:10:42,659
Sang Hyeon.

196
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:45,559
What about Jae Won? What will happen to him?

197
00:10:46,189 --> 00:10:47,329
He won't answer my calls.

198
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:49,859
Right.

199
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:52,169
What happened with Jae Won?

200
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:55,669
It's nothing.

201
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,539
Anyway, good work, everyone.

202
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:00,679
Let's grab a meal this weekend. It's my treat.

203
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:01,939
- Okay.
- Okay.

204
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:03,979
We have somewhere to be.

205
00:11:04,909 --> 00:11:05,909
Let's go.

206
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:08,019
Bye. Congratulations.

207
00:11:10,349 --> 00:11:12,789
- Congratulations, Sang Hyeon.
- Thank you.

208
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:15,588
- I'd appreciate your help. Thanks.
- Okay.

209
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:17,829
- Let's go to a cafe.
- Gosh, I thought...

210
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:23,229
It's over now.

211
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:26,169
For some reason, it feels like I'm missing something.

212
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:28,399
Right.

213
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,139
What are you going to do later?

214
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:33,809
Wan Sik said he was treating everyone to malatang later.

215
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:38,079
I must attend a special lecture in 53 minutes.

216
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:40,479
Is that so?

217
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,719
Do you plan your day down to the minute?

218
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:48,619
Yes.

219
00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:57,469
Do you want to grab a beer...

220
00:11:58,199 --> 00:12:00,439
once the special lecture is over? To celebrate our win.

221
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:02,699
I still have a few cans I stashed away over Chuseok.

222
00:12:02,969 --> 00:12:04,209
I also have soju.

223
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:09,309
How about the soju-beer cocktail? Okay?

224
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:11,309
Do you want to get impeached...

225
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,349
on the suspicion of having a booze party?

226
00:12:14,219 --> 00:12:16,249
What suspicion? The booze party did happen.

227
00:12:21,719 --> 00:12:22,759
It's my mom.

228
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:26,559
Hey, Mom.

229
00:12:29,729 --> 00:12:30,769
We did it.

230
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:32,669
We won.

231
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,239
What?

232
00:12:38,469 --> 00:12:39,539
Okay.

233
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:46,579
- You can drink that.
- What?

234
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:48,819
I'll get going first.

235
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:52,189
Hey, what about our party?

236
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:01,329
How could I not report it?

237
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:04,098
The two of them were removing the plate from the motorcycle.

238
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:06,429
I could tell that a crime was taking place.

239
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,698
I couldn't stop thinking about how off it looked.

240
00:13:08,699 --> 00:13:10,239
So I went back there today.

241
00:13:12,109 --> 00:13:13,509
I saw the banner looking for witnesses.

242
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:15,879
So I called you right away.

243
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:17,909
I see.

244
00:13:19,609 --> 00:13:22,019
But here's the thing.

245
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:24,449
I'm very busy.

246
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:27,989
Look at my schedule today. It's jam-packed.

247
00:13:28,489 --> 00:13:31,359
Thank you so much for meeting us when you're busy.

248
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,499
- Ma'am.
- Yes.

249
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:36,999
When will you give me the reward?

250
00:13:37,669 --> 00:13:39,499
You know, the witness reward.

251
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:40,699
- What?
- Yes.

252
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:43,399
You can give me cash today, right?

253
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:48,079
Let's talk about that once our case is solved.

(Investigation Team for Traffic Accident)

255
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:51,709
- What?
- Do they match the descriptions?

256
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:53,849
Of the two guys you saw.

257
00:13:55,849 --> 00:13:57,789
Yes. The guy on the right rode the motorcycle.

258
00:13:58,249 --> 00:14:01,219
And the guy on the left helped him remove the license plate.

259
00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:02,459
- Is that so?
- Yes.

260
00:14:02,689 --> 00:14:04,829
- Why don't you take a look?
- Take a look.

261
00:14:06,289 --> 00:14:08,458
They talked to each other in English and giggled.

262
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,059
I thought they were drunk.

263
00:14:12,969 --> 00:14:13,999
Wait.

264
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:24,009
Could you take a look at this picture?

265
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:34,119
Yes. That's the guy. The guy with the biker.

266
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:36,989
Yes, that's him.

267
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:39,189
My gosh.

268
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:43,099
Se Hoon. What on earth...

269
00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:45,898
- Let me borrow this.
- Wait.

270
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:47,969
- I'll call you later.
- Oh, no.

271
00:15:05,289 --> 00:15:07,489
Is that so? Are you sure?

272
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:11,389
Yes.

273
00:15:12,489 --> 00:15:13,829
But what if...

274
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:16,699
the witness is mistaken?

275
00:15:17,429 --> 00:15:18,429
What?

276
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:25,738
Could he have agreed with you because you were confident...

277
00:15:25,739 --> 00:15:27,209
when you showed him the picture?

278
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,009
- I was confident, but...
- Besides, he saw them at night.

279
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:32,209
He could be after the reward money.

280
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:35,819
- That's what I thought at first.
- Se Hoon.

281
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:38,689
Why did you show this picture to the witness?

282
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:42,118
- I...
- It's not like...

283
00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:43,789
he witnessed the accident take place.

284
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:46,959
There's no guarantee that Sang Hyeon is the accomplice.

285
00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:49,159
Is it possible that...

286
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:51,569
you were secretly hoping this would be the case?

287
00:15:56,969 --> 00:15:59,269
The police took Kang Jae Won today because he got himself into trouble.

288
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:01,608
Why did you have to bring me this flimsy evidence?

289
00:16:01,609 --> 00:16:03,079
What do you expect me to do?

290
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,679
Se Hoon.

291
00:16:09,819 --> 00:16:10,848
Yes, Mr. Sin.

292
00:16:10,849 --> 00:16:11,849
Do you want to take a look at this?

293
00:16:14,419 --> 00:16:15,519
Sit here and watch this.

294
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,369
Do you remember this day?

295
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:00,369
Darn it.

296
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:07,379
What is this?

297
00:17:17,749 --> 00:17:18,949
Yes. Right.

298
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,819
But by the time I got there,

299
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:25,159
I saw a sign of someone having been there before me.

300
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:29,999
And someone's fingerprint was on it too.

301
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:34,269
Hear me out. Here's what I don't understand.

302
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:38,339
Why did you get rid of the evidence? Why?

303
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:40,409
I don't know.

304
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:42,809

- Se Hoon.

305
00:17:43,339 --> 00:17:45,009
- Yes?
- Se Hoon!

306
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:51,849
I'll level with you.

307
00:17:53,089 --> 00:17:54,789
I can understand how this could happen.

308
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:58,128
Kids your age tend to get too competitive.

309
00:17:58,129 --> 00:17:59,159
So I can understand...

310
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:01,228
why you'd do something like that.

311
00:18:01,229 --> 00:18:02,999
That's why I've been turning a blind eye.

313
00:18:07,699 --> 00:18:08,739
After all that,

314
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:12,709
you guys won the election today.

315
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:15,139
But you came to tell me...

316
00:18:15,379 --> 00:18:17,008
that the elected president, Kwak Sang Hyeon,

317
00:18:17,009 --> 00:18:19,349
was an accomplice in your hit-and-run accident...

318
00:18:19,509 --> 00:18:22,018
while conveniently forgetting everything you had done.

319

Mr. Sin!

320
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:25,249
I didn't do it.

321
00:18:25,719 --> 00:18:28,119
- Someone else already...
- Then why did you pick that up?

322
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:31,529
You were trying to get rid of the evidence!

323
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:33,129
Yes, I was.

324
00:18:33,629 --> 00:18:36,128
But that evidence doesn't prove that I was the one who did it.

325
00:18:36,129 --> 00:18:37,969
Come on. You little...

326
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:39,599
Hey.

327
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,068
How did you know in advance...

328
00:18:42,069 --> 00:18:44,739
someone else would do that when you came to school that night?

329
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:47,639
Your story doesn't add up, you punk.

330
00:18:48,139 --> 00:18:49,478
You wanted to win the election...

331
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:50,909
even if it meant cutting your opponents' eyeballs out.

332
00:18:51,579 --> 00:18:52,778

333
00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:54,319

Answer me.

337
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,519
There must be a reason you're stirring things up.

00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:31,509
Okay. Let's shake hands and make up.

361
00:20:32,909 --> 00:20:35,519
You crazy jerk. Come on.

362
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:39,019
- One, two, three.
- I'll take it now.

363
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:43,689
Come on.

364
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:48,429
- That hurts.
- Let me do it.

365
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:53,299
(Son of the Poultry Farmhouse)

366
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:07,448
(Please answer my call, Park Ji Hun.)

367
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:09,078
(Honestly, I don't know what to say to you right now.)

368
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:10,618
(- Let's talk later. - Later when?)

369
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:12,189
(I'm not sure.)

370
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:19,629
Hey, Park Ji Hun.

371
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:22,259
Ji Hun.

372
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:25,999
Let's talk, come on.

373
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,399
Park Ji Hun.

374
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:36,509
(Son of the Poultry Farmhouse)

375
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:45,149
Darn.

376
00:22:02,969 --> 00:22:03,969
Come on.

377
00:22:04,939 --> 00:22:06,009
Darn it.

378
00:22:17,449 --> 00:22:19,189
At what point did it start to fall apart?

379
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:23,389
To find the answer to this question,

380
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:26,429
that's where I went back to.

381
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:31,329
Hey, Vice President. To what do I owe this pleasure?

382
00:22:31,699 --> 00:22:33,329
There was something I wanted to ask you.

383
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:35,399
Where are you?

384
00:22:35,499 --> 00:22:39,209
Well, I have a family event. So I'm out.

385
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:41,339
Is that so?

386
00:22:42,209 --> 00:22:43,309
A family event?

387
00:22:46,609 --> 00:22:47,679
Hello?

388
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:50,849
Hey, Noh Se. Noh Se?

389
00:23:24,819 --> 00:23:25,819
Hey.

390
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:29,889
Come on!

391
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,189
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

392
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,899
(Exit)

393
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:40,599
(Exit)

394
00:23:46,209 --> 00:23:48,509
(Warning: Entry by Permission Only)

395
00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:17,139
- You're so good at that.
- Don't be humble.

396
00:24:17,239 --> 00:24:18,909
Whatever. Let's just drink.

397
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:20,839
- I'm in.
- Cheers.

398
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:23,308
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

399
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:24,509
- Cheers.
- Let's go.

400
00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:25,908
- Come on.
- Cheers.

401
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:27,349
- Just drink.
- Yes.

402
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:28,619
I'm good.

403
00:24:28,979 --> 00:24:30,079
It's fine.

404
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:31,849
Let's drink and bury the hatchet.

405
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:33,289
- Cheers.
- Okay.

406
00:24:34,459 --> 00:24:36,019
Yu Gyeong, I'm sorry.

407
00:24:36,589 --> 00:24:37,858
- You're teasing her.
- Whatever.

408
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:40,029
He's a bit immature. You should cut him some slack.

409
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:47,469
You little jerk. You good-for-nothing scumbag!

410
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:48,539
My gosh. You...

411
00:24:48,939 --> 00:24:50,299
What are you going to do?

412
00:24:51,939 --> 00:24:54,909
- You think you're a big shot now?
- Hey, cut it out.

413
00:24:55,239 --> 00:24:58,048
- What's wrong with them?
- I told you not to do that.

414
00:24:58,049 --> 00:24:59,679
That hurts.

415
00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:07,819
When he started to take down Noh Se, I was so surprised. Seriously.

416
00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:10,989
That's not funny. Stop that.

417
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:13,159
- Gosh.
- What's wrong with him?

418
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:17,099
- Hey.
- Hey. It's spilling over.

419
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:18,828
- Are you drunk?
- You know what? I can just wipe it.

420
00:25:18,829 --> 00:25:19,899
- Why are you...
- Gosh.

421
00:25:21,569 --> 00:25:23,868
- All right.
- Oh, my.

422
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:25,208
You jerk, Ho Seok.

423
00:25:25,209 --> 00:25:26,638
- Take it.
- No.

424
00:25:26,639 --> 00:25:27,679
Come on.

425
00:25:29,109 --> 00:25:32,049
I'll drink later. I have to drop off Joo Yeon.

426
00:25:32,509 --> 00:25:33,949
Yes. Stop giving him drinks.

427
00:25:34,109 --> 00:25:35,679
I hate drunk drivers.

428
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:36,849
That's what you're worried about?

429
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:40,048
He was even behind the hit-and-run accident.

430
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:41,688
What are you so scared about?

431
00:25:41,689 --> 00:25:43,659
- Shut your mouth.
- What? A hit-and-run?

432
00:25:44,019 --> 00:25:45,159
What's this about?

433
00:25:47,289 --> 00:25:48,759
- What?
- What's this about?

434
00:25:49,729 --> 00:25:50,729
It's nothing.

435
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:53,499
I'll hit your boobs and run.

436
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:54,998
- Come on. What are you doing?
- You crazy jerk.

437
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:55,999
- What is this?
- Stop it.

438
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,639
- Let's drink.
- Come on.

439
00:25:57,769 --> 00:25:58,839
- All right.
- Cheers.

440
00:25:58,969 --> 00:26:00,639
- Cheers.
- Let's drink.

441
00:26:02,209 --> 00:26:03,379
- What was that?
- What?

442
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:05,349
Noh Se.

443
00:26:05,709 --> 00:26:07,049
- Noh Se Hoon?
- What? He was invited too?

444
00:26:11,189 --> 00:26:12,319
What's this?

445
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:14,149
- An appointment certificate?
- What?

446
00:26:18,229 --> 00:26:19,629
What's he doing here?

447
00:26:20,859 --> 00:26:22,099
Kang Jae Won!

448
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:24,059
Did you let him in?

449
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:28,039
Where is this jerk?

450
00:26:30,499 --> 00:26:31,709
What's gotten into him?

451
00:26:33,269 --> 00:26:34,909
What are you doing here? You weren't invited.

452
00:26:36,379 --> 00:26:38,079
I told you I wanted to ask you something.

453
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:40,679
What do you need to ask me?

454
00:26:41,249 --> 00:26:42,848
What was so important...

455
00:26:42,849 --> 00:26:44,749
that you snuck into my house like a thief?

456
00:26:47,249 --> 00:26:49,019
Why did you ask me to join your campaign?

457
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:50,789
What?

458
00:26:51,689 --> 00:26:53,159
Why did you sweet-talk me into joining you...

459
00:26:53,689 --> 00:26:55,929
when you knew I was going to join Won Dae's campaign?

460
00:26:58,929 --> 00:26:59,999
You little punk.

461
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:01,839
I didn't sweet-talk you into anything.

462
00:27:02,699 --> 00:27:04,239
Do you think you're so important?

463
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:14,619
Hey, Kwak Sang Hyeon.

464
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:18,249
Noh Se Hoon, you loser. Have you lost your mind?

465
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:21,389
Did you just drop the honorifics?

466
00:27:21,689 --> 00:27:22,859
Answer me, you jerk.

467
00:27:28,999 --> 00:27:31,198
You were a nobody who had nothing going on other than studying.

468
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:32,669
And I made you the vice president.

469
00:27:34,899 --> 00:27:35,999
You're so full of it.

470
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:38,769
- Hey.
- You think I'm full of it?

471
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:41,239
- Oh, no. That crazy jerk.
- Darn it.

472
00:27:42,209 --> 00:27:44,478
- Stop it. Hey, I told you to stop.
- Hey. No.

473
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:46,578
- Come here, you jerk!
- Hey.

474
00:27:46,579 --> 00:27:48,618
- Noh Se Hoon, you jerk. Come here.
- Stop it.

475
00:27:48,619 --> 00:27:49,948
- I told you to stop it.
- Come here, you jerk.

476
00:27:49,949 --> 00:27:51,318
- Hey, Noh Se Hoon.
- Stop it.

477
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:52,589
- Stop it.
- Come on.

478
00:27:52,889 --> 00:27:53,919
- Hey.
- No!

479
00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:56,359
The hit-and-run accident that night...

480
00:27:56,789 --> 00:27:58,259
You two were behind it, right?

481
00:27:59,229 --> 00:28:00,229
What?

482
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:03,399
Did I hurt your pride when someone like me challenged your friend?

483
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:04,869
Unbelievable.

484
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:06,499
Is that why you two came up with this?

485
00:28:06,969 --> 00:28:08,738
- To mess me up?
- Fine. Let go of me.

486
00:28:08,739 --> 00:28:09,998
You used me for sympathy votes?

487
00:28:09,999 --> 00:28:11,168
I told you to let go of me!

488
00:28:11,169 --> 00:28:12,908
What if I did? What will you do?

489
00:28:12,909 --> 00:28:14,239
Do you have proof, you jerk?

490
00:28:14,369 --> 00:28:15,709
That's not the only thing I have.

491
00:28:15,939 --> 00:28:17,879
I even have a witness, you scumbag!

492
00:28:18,379 --> 00:28:19,909
What? Scared, are you?

493
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:21,479
So tell me.

494
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:23,318
Why did you make me,

495
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:25,719
a loser who only lived to study, the vice president?

496
00:28:26,189 --> 00:28:28,119
- Why did you do it?
- That jerk.

497
00:28:28,189 --> 00:28:29,219
Stop it!

498
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:34,089
- Oh, no.
- Is he okay?

499
00:28:35,229 --> 00:28:36,259
Does it hurt?

500
00:28:37,459 --> 00:28:38,468
No!

501
00:28:38,469 --> 00:28:40,129
- Hey, Kwak Sang Hyeon.
- Kwak Sang Hyeon.

502
00:28:41,139 --> 00:28:43,039
- Hey, Ho Seok. Stop him.
- Oh, no.

503
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:47,239
- Hey, stop it.
- Get off me!

504
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:48,438
Why?

505
00:28:48,439 --> 00:28:50,008
Did you come all the way here just to ask me that?

506
00:28:50,009 --> 00:28:51,009
Why?

507
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:53,479
Darn it. I did it because I felt sorry for you. So what?

508
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:55,178
I needed someone like you,

509
00:28:55,179 --> 00:28:57,749
a loser to draw pity and balance out my campaign.

510
00:28:57,849 --> 00:28:59,288
You don't know that...

511
00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:00,989
people get jealous when popular kids stick together, right?

512
00:29:01,189 --> 00:29:02,819
Stop it!

513
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:04,289
I finally get it.

514
00:29:05,689 --> 00:29:09,299
I wasn't someone anyone darn well needed or wanted.

515
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:10,559
Oh, no.

516
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:12,629
I was just disposable.

517
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,439
You know nothing, you punk.

518
00:29:18,069 --> 00:29:19,508
Darn it. You ought to thank me...

519
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:21,109
for teaching you a lesson.

520
00:29:24,749 --> 00:29:26,349
There was never...

521
00:29:27,009 --> 00:29:28,679
a spot for me here.

522
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:33,218
Thank you for teaching me a lesson, you jerk!

523
00:29:33,219 --> 00:29:35,058
He must've been filming everything.

524
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:36,159
He must be out of his mind.

525
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:37,758
How long has he been recording this?

526
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:39,959
- Come on. What's he doing?
- You jerk...

527
00:29:41,929 --> 00:29:43,129
Hey, stop it.

528
00:29:52,569 --> 00:29:55,039
Kang Jae Won. What are you doing?

529
00:29:56,739 --> 00:29:58,709
It's about time you come to your senses.

530
00:30:00,649 --> 00:30:01,879
Enough is enough.

531
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,259
- Hey, are you all right?
- Jae Won.

532
00:30:15,459 --> 00:30:16,659
Do you think you can get up?

533
00:30:20,199 --> 00:30:21,199
Darn it.

534
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:22,669
Darn it.

535
00:30:26,139 --> 00:30:27,239
Darn.

536
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:48,029
Oh, no.

537
00:31:15,019 --> 00:31:17,459
- Look at that.
- Oh, my. What happened?

538

- Look at that.

541
00:31:25,899 --> 00:31:27,368
Is anyone hurt?

542
00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:28,868
- Look over there.
- Okay.

543
00:31:28,869 --> 00:31:30,398
- Someone threw that out the window.
- My gosh.

544
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:31,768
- Thank you.
- It just dropped out of the sky.

545

00:31:44,989 --> 00:31:46,149
What, you punk?

548
00:31:48,719 --> 00:31:49,789
My gosh.

549
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:52,828

didn't have it in me to go back to who I used to be.

572

I couldn't go back to my old self before joining the campaign.

- Hey, finish that.

If you didn't sign the paper, make sure to sign it.

578

I couldn't bring myself to do that.

579
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:30,819

580

- I hope you will graduate...
- As I didn't think...

582
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,259
- I could go back to the old days...
- from high school.

583

Did you get your GED results yet?

623
00:36:44,279 --> 00:36:45,749
- They're coming out next week.
- I see.
