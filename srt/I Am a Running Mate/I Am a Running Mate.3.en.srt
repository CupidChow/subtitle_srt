1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,360
(No. 1, Noh Se Hoon)

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,040
(I Am A Running Mate)

3
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,050
Come on, Noh Se.

4
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,650
Don't be so angry anymore.

5
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,420
Do you have to say that over a text?

6
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,459
That's why I kept asking you to talk.

7
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,460
Whatever.

8
00:00:42,461 --> 00:00:44,230
What did Yang Won Dae do to win you over?

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,300
How did he convince you?

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,400
Oh, that...

11
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,070
I was...

12
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,340
convinced by Yu Gyeong.

13
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,010
Well, you know how embarrassing it is between you and Won Dae.

14
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,610
Does he not care about people's grades anymore?

15
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,180
No, he says he's all right with that now.

16
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,559
But depending on how I think about what you said,

17
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,660
I kind of feel totally annoyed.

18
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,960
I'm not sorry at all, so don't try to get all dramatic.

19
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,900
Okay, then.

20
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,729
Well, the homeroom teacher agrees, and my parents think that...

21
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,000
this will be a great opportunity for me.

22
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,939
Even if I don't get elected,

23
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,339
it could become a story for me to write about on college applications.

24
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,639
They were telling me that, so I just took their word for it.

25
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,480
When you were quarantined because you had COVID-19,

26
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,810
I bought and delivered fried chicken to you every night.

27
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,880
Is this how you stab me in the back?

28
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,789
Hey, man. I'm not stabbing you in the back.

29
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,120
What? Am I not allowed to run in the election?

30
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,260
No, not you.

31
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,330
You don't set a good example for anyone as a student.

32
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,300
Anyway,

33
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,440
I can still vote for you like I promised, right?

34
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,400
Then, am I supposed to vote for you?

35
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,610
Of course you should.

36
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,539
That's how this will truly be a fair game.

37
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,540
Get lost.

38
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,880
I'm voting for myself.

39
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,280
Gosh, punk. You're so selfish.

40
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,750
Still, you should've thought about...

41
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,450
quitting the choir once more.

42
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,090
Oh, I'm sorry.

43
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,030
It's fine.

44
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,259
You did it because you felt pressured.

45
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,800
There's no need to apologize to me.

46
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,600
Anyway, things have gotten rather awkward.

47
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,130
I feel bad for Yang Won Dae for some reason too.

48
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,270
No.

49
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,800
You don't have to feel bad about anything.

50
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,370
I think it's better this way.

51
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,210
I should've quit a long time ago.

52
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,139
- Hello.
- Hello.

53
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,280
- Hi.
- Oh, my.

54
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,150
Okay, got it.

55
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,620
Oh, right.

56
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,819
It's my birthday tomorrow, and I'm having a party.

57
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,889
You should come too.

58
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,360
A birthday party? Oh, okay.

59
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,359
- Hello.
- Hi.

60
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,659
Was I just invited to Sang Hyeon's birthday party?

61
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,900
- Hello.
- Hi.

62
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,310
It looks more like a normal apartment building than I thought.

63
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,610
All right. We're here.

64
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,950
Oh, okay.

65
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,650
This is the moving boutique in human form,

66
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,549
the truly rich, Kwak Sang Hyeon. So, I thought...

67
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,989
Did you think it might look different in some way?

68
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,990
Well...

69
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,289
Sang Hyeon will come and get you. You can get out here.

70
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,290
Yes, sir.

71
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,800
Se Hoon.

72
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,070
You can't take any photos on your cell phone today.

73
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,510
What? Why?

74
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,380
Don't even take your phone out.

75
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,310
Oh, right.

76
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,050
Okay, I understand.

77
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,860
What I mean is...

78
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,230
to enjoy yourself instead of spending time taking photos, okay?

79
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,870
Okay, Sang Hyeon.

80
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,039
(Private property beyond this point)

81
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,509
(This is private property. No trespassing allowed.)

82
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,910
(No entry unless in case of disaster, CCTV in operation)

83
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,420
- Hey, what's up with him?
- Look at his shoes.

84
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,219
- He took off his shoes.
- It's okay. You can keep them on.

85
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,060
Oh, okay.

86
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,160
- See you later.
- Okay.

87
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,159
This is all because of security.

88
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,030
Use your phones and be sure to turn them back in.

89
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,669
- Hey. What?
- Give it here.

90
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,800
Your cell phone!

91
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,670
- My gosh.
- It's okay. He's fine.

92
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,539
- Wan Sik.
- Yes.

93
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,410
- Here's my phone.
- Okay.

94
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,479
I'll come upstairs and make you something worth dying for. Really.

95
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,480
Looking forward to it.

96
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,289
- Hey.
- Happy birthday.

97
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,619
- Thank you.
- Happy birthday.

98
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,619
- Don't be upset, guys.
- Hey, you got your hair done.

99
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,630
- Be sure to turn in your phones.
- What's this?

100
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,589
- See you later upstairs.
- Okay.

101
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,360
Inside a normal apartment building,

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,700
there was an extraordinary world.

103
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,900
This is...

104
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,570
Kwak Sang Hyeon's real world.

105
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,059
Is everyone having fun?

106
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,600
- Yes!
- Yes!

107
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,170
All right. Attention.

108
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,440
This is Noh Se Hoon.

109
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,970
Jeong Hui, can you raise your hand?

110
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,840
These guys are my running mates in the election.

111
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,550
Hey, KwakKwaki.

112
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,380
I want to transfer schools.

113
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,490
Let me vote for you too!

114
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,090
Come on. You should care more about your GPA, college guy.

115
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,920
Don't try to butt in when the kids are having fun.

116
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,190
- Say hello.
- Oh, okay.

117
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,099
Hello, please look kindly upon me.

118
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,230
- You're adorable!
- So cute!

119
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,070
You're cute!

120
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,170
Looking good!

121
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,440
Hi.

122
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,010
Hey, Kwak Sang Hyeon!

123
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,879
Leave the introductions for later.

124
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,780
Let's focus on the party from now on!

125
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,850
Let's get it on!

126
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,919
- Do a good job for us.
- I will.

127
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,189
You should stay close with them from now on.

128
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,230
Hey, this is Noh Se Hoon.

129
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,099
Guys, this is Noh Se Hoon.

130
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,130
- Be nice to him.
- Hey!

131
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,329
Mi Na, this is Noh Se.

132
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,070
Of course I know Se Hoon.

133
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,569
- He's cute.
- Hi, Se Hoon.

134
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,599
- Hello.
- Be nice to him.

135
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,140
- Hi.
- Hello.

136
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,940
Drink it up.

137
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,979
- Drink it up.
- Se Hoon?

138
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,609
- Drink it up.
- Drink it up.

139
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,309
- Drink it up!
- Drink it up!

140
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,119
- Drink it up!
- Drink it up!

141
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,650
- Drink it up!
- Drink it up!

142
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,419
- Drink it up!
- Drink it up!

143
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,050
Hey, no!

144
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,759
He's on his way back from his academy.

145
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,589
He can't smell like alcohol.

146
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,720
Come on.

147
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,830
That's no fun.

148
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,530
Hey, Kwak Sang Hyeon.

149
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,960
Who cares? It's just one drink.

150
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,670
You're being so protective. That's totally not fun.

151
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,100
I can't really drink...

152
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,570
Just one drink.

153
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,780
Hey, he's just a kid. Don't pressure him.

154
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,340
We're all right here.

155
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,449
Hey, I'll take one.

156
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,580
- Let's mix these, then.
- Of course.

157
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,060
You fool.

158
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,890
What? "You fool?"

159
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:57,930
Hey.

160
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,510
Nice!

161
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,560
- Hey, Se Hoon.
- Is he okay?

162
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,020
Are you okay?

163
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,860
One more drink!

164
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,210
Nice! Cheers!

165
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,519
All right, drink up!

166
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,360
Oh, I don't drink.

167
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,490
There you go. That's it.

168
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:08,930
Take this.

169
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,980
Hey, whose cell phone is that?

170
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,709
Hey, I'm done for. It's my mom!

171
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,710
Hyeon Jin!

172
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,080
- Hey, turn off the music!
- Okay!

173
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,550
Hey, get that thing...

174
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,790
Hey, shut the curtains!

175
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,359
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

176
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,520
Hey, everyone be quiet!

177
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,190
Hey, Mom.

178
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,860
Happy birthday, son!

179
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,329
It's my birthday. Why are you two going on a trip?

180
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,569
This isn't a trip.

181
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,430
I just tagged along for your dad's business trip.

182
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,140
Hey, Sang Hyeon. What were you doing?

183
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,909
The housekeeper made braised short ribs.

184
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,410
I ate and was getting some rest.

185
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,179
Okay. Don't you dare...

186
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,249
invite your friends over and make a mess like last time, okay?

187
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,650
Come on, Dad.

188
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,920
I don't even have that many friends.

189
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,050
All right. Happy birthday.

190
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,089
Happy birthday, my son.

191
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,260
- Thanks. I love you.
- Bye.

192
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,690
My goodness.

193
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,030
- What was that?
- What were you doing? Be honest!

194
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,860
My gosh.

195
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,500
- That was close.
- "I love you too."

196
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,500
Gosh, punk.

197
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,110
Hey.

198
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,980
Which jerk laughed earlier?

199
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,150
Now, the real party has begun!

200
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,050
Seriously, man.

201
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,530
Oh, boy.

202
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,460
Nice.

203
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,470
What?

204
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,910
Gosh, what was that?

205
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,450
This is my bag.

206
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,890
Darn it.

207
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,530
My goodness.

208
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,730
Seriously, where did...

209
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,100
such an ugly-looking outsider like you come from?

210
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,900
You can't even read the room.

211
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,000
How embarrassing.

212
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,850
Wait right there!

213
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,420
I said to wait right there, you jerk!

214
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:46,720
What are you going to do?

215
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,090
- What?
- What are you saying?

216
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,370
You total piece of trash and scumbag!

217
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,340
Hey, stop them!

218
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,040
Get him off!

219
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,680
Hey, man! Stop!

220
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,850
Hey, you scumbag!

221
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,220
Yes! Fight!

222
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,370
Hey, what's going on? Move aside.

223
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,480
Are you crazy?

224
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,550
Shoot!

225
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,589
- I'm going to kill you!
- Hey!

226
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,919
Stop it!

227
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,519
- I'm going to kill him!
- You can't.

228
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,020
Are you going to keep going and end up dead?

229
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,590
Or will you stop?

230
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,190
I'll stop.

231
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,660
Follow me, you punk.

232
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,799
Hey, let's all go to the rooftop.

233
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,469
Guys, let's go!

234
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,739
- Come with me.
- Hey, it's no big deal.

235
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,740
- Okay?
- All right. Let's go.

236
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,500
Yes! Let's go!

237
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,239
- Come this way!
- All right.

238
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,640
- Nice.
- Okay, let's go.

239
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,220
Gosh, darn it.

240
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,490
That punk. Shoot.

241
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,630
This is totally embarrassing.

242
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,100
Hey.

243
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,740
What?

244
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,780
Shoot, why did you bring a guy like that here?

245
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,710
- That total fool...
- You're speaking too harshly.

246
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,780
Didn't you hear me introduce him earlier?

247
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,790
- Are you joking?
- Shoot, does this seem like a joke?

248
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,690
Just go home.

249
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,730
I don't even want to look at you.

250
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:09,970
What a fool.

251
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,010
Darn it.

252
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,820
Darn it.

253
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,460
- Ta-da!
- Yes!

254
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,389
What kind of fool makes fists like this?

255
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:39,630
Put that inside and hit him like this!

256
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,230
Harder, punk. Go on and hit me.

257
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,600
Hard!

258
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,279
- Get lost.
- Yu Gyeong, why are you so late?

259
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,379
- Hurry up.
- Come on.

260
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,680
- Take him away.
- Hey, get up.

261
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,520
What's wrong with him?

262
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,560
- You're the best.
- Bye.

263
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,380
What?

264
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,930
What? He has two more Ultra electronic watches?

265
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,050
Gosh, that scared me. My goodness.

266
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,840
Hang on.

267
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,410
Oh, right. Last night...

268
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,420
Perhaps, Mi Na...

269
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,320
and me?

270
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:26,030
Gosh, you were talking about setting an example or whatever.

271
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,170
You were just acting like an adult, weren't you?

272
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,740
- An adult?
- Yes.

273
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:35,770
What's this?

274
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,680
What?

275
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,550
Hey, Noh Se.

276
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:45,280
I think you're hiding something much bigger.

277
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,320
No, I'm not. There's absolutely nothing at all.

278
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,760
I know. So, what is it?

279
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,990
What is this absolute nothing of a story?

280
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,330
Hey, Ji Hun. I'll ring you guys up.

281
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,000
I'll pay for these punks too.

282
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,700
Jae Won.

283
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,470
- Thank you.
- Sure.

284
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,540
Sweet.

285
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,350
- Who was that?
- Oh, it's Jae Won.

286
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,680
Was he there too, perhaps?

287
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,290
Yes, of course. He's super nice.

288
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:25,160
What do you mean, he's super nice?

289
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,290
He's gulping down hovenia tea at this hour of the morning.

290
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,800
You can't say this to anyone, okay?

291
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,600
It's a secret.

292
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,230
I see.

293
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,370
Is that so?

294
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,809
Hey, guys! Noh Se is crazy!

295
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:46,040
- Hey, you crazy punk!
- You can't! Park Ji Hun, you punk!

296
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,750
Stop right there! Hey!

297
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,820
Hey, shut your mouth!

298
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,590
Hey!

299
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,960
Excuse me.

300
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:06,030
Gosh, are these the election posters? Already?

301
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,099
Did you make these yourself?

302
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,069
Yes. Promotions only work when you catch people off guard.

303
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,599
Gosh, how did you make the shadows like this?

304
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,269
Hyeon Jin, when will we put these up?

305
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,510
What time is it now? Well...

306
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,050
Who wants to grab burgers after school today?

307
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,280
Me.

308
00:19:22,281 --> 00:19:25,749
- Me!
- Me!

309
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,990
Hey, you should help us out and eat with us.

310
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,489
Oh, we have choir practice later.

311
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,389
- My gosh.
- Come on. You ruined the mood.

312
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:36,760
Okay, then. Everyone except those in choir, tag along.

313
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,929
Let's put the posters up soon and grab those burgers.

314
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:41,529
- Hamburgers!
- Why'd you do that?

315
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,970
- Hamburgers!
- Hamburgers!

316
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,000
All right. Try it.

317
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,740
It's a bit dark.

318
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,040
- Look here.
- Sir, can I go see the nurse?

319
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,180
Get some rest.

320
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,990
(Will you send 600 dollars to Burger Boy?)

321
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,040
All right.

322
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,080
They're ready, right?

323
00:20:30,081 --> 00:20:32,850
Hey, hurry up.

324
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,260
What?

325
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:41,730
Hey.

326
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,970
- Okay, let's go.
- Let's do this.

327
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,900
Yes, that's it.

328
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,269
Okay! Groups 1 and 2, let's all move!

329
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,009
- All right.
- Let's go!

330
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,980
- Yes!
- Let's go!

331
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,380
Okay.

332
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:03,980
- Nice!
- Thank you!

333
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:08,589
- The diet...
- The diet...

334
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,990
- Starts tomorrow!
- Starts tomorrow!

335
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,330
That punk is making such a fuss.

336
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,329
(Youngjin High School Student Council)

337
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,429
(Youngjin High School)

338
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,400
What? Kwak Sang Hyeon.

339
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,140
When did he put these up?

340
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,940
Gosh, look at these.

341
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,779
They look kind of like concert posters.

342
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,880
These are so sweet.

343
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,150
Are they so sweet? Shoot, are you happy about this?

344
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,079
What should we do, then? Should we try this too?

345
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,150
Are you kidding me?

346
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,649
You want to make something as classless as this?

347
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:45,460
- It seems okay. Isn't it?
- As if!

348
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,659
It's not even the set date,

349
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,290
but he's cutting ahead like a little rat.

350
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,400
Hey, we're going to follow standard tactics.

351
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,930
Let's not become eye candy with this stuff. It's embarrassing.

352
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,570
All right.

353
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,339
- Ji Hun.
- Yes?

354
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,480
Don't get discouraged.

355
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:08,410
This stuff has nothing to do with the student body's sentiment.

356
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,250
I'm the current vice president.

357
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:11,720
Just trust me.

358
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,380
Oh, I see.

359
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,090
- Okay.
- Good.

360
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:22,790
(One step)

361
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,599
- You punk!
- Gosh, why didn't that work?

362
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,900
- Good luck.
- Hey, let's try it again.

363
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:30,900
I love you!

364
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,840
- Noh Se will work hard!
- He's cute.

365
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,040
Hey, Noh Se!

366
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:38,139
What is all this? You're embarrassing me.

367
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,640
Hey, Noh Se. How about this for a slogan?

368
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,749
Let's take a picture to celebrate.

369
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,279
- Hey, gather around.
- Okay.

370
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,979
- Gosh, why? I'm so tired.
- Come on.

371
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,749
- Hurry up, guys.
- Smile.

372
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,289
Vice presidential candidate, Noh Se Hoon!

373
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:51,959
- Noh Se Hoon, you've made it.
- Let's give him lots of support.

374
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,389
Hey, you're the vice presidential candidate. Smile a bit.

375
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:56,530
- Guys, smile.
- Smile!

376
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,560
That punk is having fun.

377
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,000
Hey, Jong Su, it's today.

378
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,069
Mr. Hard-on, that scumbag.

379
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,269
We should take him down. That jerk.

380
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,700
You're so dead, you piece of trash.

381
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,440
Okay, on 1, 2, 3.

382
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:15,049
Gosh, don't make such a fuss. Do you have a death wish?

383
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:16,210
Hey, stop it.

384
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,850
You can't do this to the future vice president.

385
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,020
Get up, you piece of trash.

386
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,660
You must be quite close to the older guys these days.

387
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,360
Shoot, are they your bodyguards or something?

388
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,260
Well, that's because...

389
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,930
we're preparing for the election together.

390
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,270
But just because you're tight with them,

391
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,940
it doesn't mean you're all that, does it?

392
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,510
Wake up, you punk.

393
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,849
Shoot, stop acting up...

394
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,410
before I shave your head.

395
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,650
But what if...

396
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,920
I really get elected?

397
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,520
What do you think will happen to you guys?

398
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:02,959
Gosh, darn it!

399
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,160
Mr. Hard-on is going on about getting elected? You fool.

400
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,500
Are you running for mayor?

401
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,100
Or the president of the country?

402
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,040
Hey, Noh Se.

403
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,239
What do you think your senior year will be like...

404
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,310
after the older guys graduate?

405
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,180
Haven't you thought of that?

406
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,710
You guys will be seniors too, then.

407
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:25,020
Will you keep bullying kids until then?

408
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,580
Of course, punk.

409
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,920
Senior year doesn't matter to us...

410
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,960
since we have no intention of going to college.

411
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,730
- Isn't that right?
- What?

412
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,730
Well, that's a bit...

413
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,830
Well, Jong Su. We should still go to college.

414
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,370
I mean, we should go on retreats and date girls.

415
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,400
And have sex.

416
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,710
Why, you little punks.

417
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:51,680
Anyway, Noh Se.

418
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,010
If you want to sit comfortably and study,

419
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,210
think hard about what you should do from now on.

420
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,020
Got it?

421
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,750
Okay.

422
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,590
Got it.

423
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,220
I'll think about it.

424
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,200
Why do you look so downcast, man?

425
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,640
Is something going on?

426
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,440
No, nothing is going on.

427
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,609
By the way, where are you going?

428
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,110
None of your business, punk.

429
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,760
Wait a second. Darn it.

430
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,940
Why are you doing this?

431
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,270
I was right.

432
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,750
Who was it?

433
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,350
That's from someone grabbing you by the collar.

434
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,320
I was just fooling around with the guys at school earlier.

435
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,890
You, Noh Se? Fooling around and grabbing each other by the collar?

436
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,220
Yes.

437
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,920
Don't make me laugh.

438
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,340
Whatever. Which class are you in?

439
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,639
I'm really okay. You don't have to make the guys...

440
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,010
You're the vice president. Are you going to get beaten up like a fool?

441
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,780
I'll take care of it. You stay out of this.

442
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,919
- Hello.
- Hi.

443
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,889
Gosh, I'm already tired.

444
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:50,030
- Kids, let us come through.
- What's that?

445
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,460
What's going on this early in the morning?

446
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,660
Did something happen?

447
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:58,140
Sir, which building is the disciplinary committee in?

448
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,970
You should go to the second floor of the building in front.

449
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,210
But what is this about?

450
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,140
Oh, we just have to check on something.

451
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,880
- Have a good day.
- Sure.

452
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,150
- What could it be?
- What's going on?

453
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,990
"Seoul's Y High School with an 80-year history,"

454
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,090
"turns out to be the furnace of college admissions corruption."

455
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:22,990
It must be something like that.

456
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:25,360
Your face is what's corrupt.

457
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,569
"Anyone who insults another in public will face up to..."

458
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:30,000
"a year in prison or 2,000 dollars in fines."

459
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,399
This is about you, Jo Han Byeol.

460
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,039
Gosh, you're so chatty. Go away!

461
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,269
Seriously, why do you have that memorized?

462
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,980
Anyway, it's out of the ordinary for the police to show up.

463
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,810
Hey, Noh Se. This is bad.

464
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,080
Won Dae was just arrested by the police.

465
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,579
What? Why did they take him?

466
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,450
He wasn't arrested. They just took him with them.

467
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,520
No.

468
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,190
It seemed pretty serious.

469
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,229
I think something is up, for sure.

470
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,890
Shoot, I'm sure he could do anything.

471
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,429
He was stabbed in the back by a junior from the get-go.

472
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,660
I'm sure he's all riled up about it.

473
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,070
- No, I'm serious.
- But isn't that...

474
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,330
What?

475
00:28:04,331 --> 00:28:05,569
Don't joke around, man!

476
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,640
- They took him in just now?
- Yes.

477
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,340
It wasn't that long ago. I'm sure they haven't even left yet.

478
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,410
Darn it.

479
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,679
Hey, but what is up with that punk?

480
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,050
Is he worried or is he going to watch?

481
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,250
Hey, you should give it a rest too.

482
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,619
The police are here.

483
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,360
- What's going on?
- It's Yang Won Dae.

484
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,599
- My gosh.
- What is it?

485
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,960
Yang Won Dae is doomed.

486
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,300
- What's going to happen to him?
- Oh, no.

487
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,299
That's crazy.

488
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,070
- He's short-tempered.
- He's in big trouble.

489
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,370
My goodness.

490
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,340
- Get in now.
- Yes, sir.

491
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,400
- Congratulations, In Gyeong.
- Thank you.

492
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,870
- Okay, let's do that.
- Hey, guys.

493
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,169
- Hello, In Gyeong.
- Hello.

494
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,270
Hello, In Gyeong.

495
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:20,040
- Is everything going well?
- Of course.

496
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:24,249
By the way, isn't your opponent Yang Won Dae from the choir?

497
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,250
Yes.

498
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,320
I heard that he got taken to the police today. What happened?

499
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,890
I asked around, but no one seems to know.

500
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,820
Noh Se, do you know anything?

501
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,599
Well, I always thought that he was short-tempered.

502
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,100
- Really?
- Yes.

503
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,729
Make sure your public image stays clean.

504
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,229
Don't ever get in trouble, okay?

505
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,300
Okay, In Gyeong.

506
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,809
By the way, he looks familiar.

507
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:50,810
Where did we meet?

508
00:29:50,811 --> 00:29:52,740
Really?

509
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,179
Oh, right. I saw you on the bus.

510
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,879
Power smashing. Aren't you the one?

511
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,720
Yes, that's him.

512
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,420
It's okay. Don't be ashamed.

513
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
Don't let it bother you.

514
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,560
Right, don't let it bother you.

515
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,190
Okay.

516
00:30:11,191 --> 00:30:13,700
Can you throw this away for me?

517
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,170
I got it.

518
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,830
Thank you.

519
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,540
In Gyeong.

520
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,670
She was the vice president in my brother's class.

521
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,810
She promised to help me this time.

522
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,310
Can she do that as a senior?

523
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,010
The college entrance exam is coming up soon.

524
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,980
Don't worry. She won't take the college entrance exam anyway.

525
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,920
She applied early to Columbia University.

526
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:38,460
(Youngjin Lounge)

527
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,090
What happened to Yang Won Dae?

528
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,460
I'm not sure.

529
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:44,030
No one is saying much about it,

530
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:45,459
so it must not be a big deal.

531
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,360
If it isn't a big deal, why would the police come?

532
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:51,670
Let's talk about that later over dakgalbi.

533
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,600
I'm going to the music room for a minute.

534
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,870
Wait for me. I won't take long.

535
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,010
How long will it take?

536
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,240
About 20 to 30...

537
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:02,750
No, 40... About 45 to 46 minutes?

538
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,419
Then let's eat it next time.

539
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,580
Hey, no way.

540
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,550
I've been talking about it since two days ago.

541
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,060
Today is the day.

542
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,260
October 12.

543
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,290
Today is the day for dakgalbi.

544
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,489
Or come with me now and wait.

545
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:20,600
I have no business of going there. I'm not part of the choir anymore.

546
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,870
It'd be so awkward.

547
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:24,000
Or go to the Internet cafe and play a game.

548
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:26,500
Okay. Hurry up.

549
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,280
Hello.

550
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,480
What? Today?

551
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,149
Okay, a little bit bigger.

552
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:46,290
Nice, great.

553
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:50,090
Lower the head slightly and look up at a 45-degree angle.

554
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:52,060
Great. Your nose.

555
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,500
Nice.

556
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,400
Nice. Great.

557
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:58,030
Okay, go.

558
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,640
Nice.

559
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,940
With pride and confidence.

560
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,879
Nice. Go.

561
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,610
I'm the star tonight.

562
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,619
- Are you nervous?
- No.

563
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:19,620
Breathe. Everything starts from breathing.

564
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,060
Are you uncomfortable? Undo your tie.

565
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:23,590
More. Pull it harder.

566
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,300
That's right. You're handsome.

567
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,030
Look to the front.

568
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:34,069
Good. With confidence.

569
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:36,309
That's it. Be more daring.

570
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,570
High Q.

571
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,109
Starting from today, walk with confidence.

572
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,280
One more time.

573
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:45,350
That's it. Nice.

574
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,820
That's right. Nice!

575
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,220
Look at that.

576
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,789
Keep going.

577
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,690
That's it. Nice.

578
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,330
Hi, Noh Se.

579
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,460
Have you eaten?

580
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,160
I'm eating now.

581
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,700
You're eating late.

582
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,140
We finished late.

583
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:06,740
Did the photo shoot go well?

584
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,640
It was really intense.

585
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,439
Is that what happened?

586
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,540
What are you guys eating?

587
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,380
Are you eating dakgalbi?

588
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,850
No, we're at Poultry Farmhouse.

589
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,920
- Poultry Farmhouse?
- Yes.

590
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,989
Son of Poultry Farmhouse?

591
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,690
Yes, you know that fried chicken place.

592
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,060
Hey, Chicken Ji Hun!

593
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,730
- What?
- Let's eat.

594
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,430
Noh Se.

595
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,800
What's that on your head?

596
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,270
What?

597
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,270
- It's so much fun.
- What did you say?

598
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,870
What's that on your head? It looks childish.

599
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,170
Is that a comb?

600
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:46,110
I know. It's embarrassing.

601
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:49,379
- Park Ji Hun, let's cut the cake.
- What are you doing? Hurry up.

602
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,509
- What are you doing?
- Come.

603
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:53,080
- Come over here.
- Let's cut the cake.

604
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,650
Oh, right. It's your birthday today.

605
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:58,190
Yes.

606
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:00,160
Even though there are only three hours left...

607
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,760
Gosh, that's why you suggested eating dakgalbi.

608
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,330
Hey, why didn't you tell me?

609
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,770
Then I would've definitely eaten with you.

610
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:12,070
Who goes around telling everyone that it's his birthday?

611
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:15,340
- You fool.
- Noh Se, what are you doing?

612
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,409
You're not here to have fun. Hurry and come back.

613
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:19,440
Okay.

614
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,879
I need to get going. Anyway,

615
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,920
let's eat together when I'm done.

616
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,150
I'll treat you to a good meal.

617
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,250
Okay.

618
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,260
Buy me 1,000 dollars worth of dakgalbi.

619
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,860
You're crazy. Okay.

620
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,330
I need to get back in.

621
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,630
Go.

622
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:44,770
Oh, right.

623
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Hello?

624
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,869
- Park Ji Hun, come quickly.
- Happy Birthday.

625
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,140
Happy Birthday, Park Ji Hun!

626
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:53,639
- Come and sit down.
- One, two, three, four.

627
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,579
- Happy Birthday to you - Happy Birthday to you

628
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,110
- Happy Birthday.
- Happy Birthday.

629
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,250
Happy Birthday.

630
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:07,160
(Son of Poultry Farmhouse)

631
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:14,330
(Son of Poultry Farmhouse)

632
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,630
Don't get angry.

633
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:17,770
Why you...

634
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,589
- What?
- What's wrong with him?

635
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,230
- What's with his neck?
- What's going on?

636
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,260
What's wrong with him?

637
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,900
What's wrong with him?

638
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,300
What's going on?

639
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:51,600
Choi Jong Su.

640
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,470
What's wrong with you?

641
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,239
Because you told on him to Kang Jae Won,

642
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,169
Jong Su had his head on the floor for three hours.

643
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,240
You jerk.

644
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,840
Be quiet.

645
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:03,010
Did Jae Won hit you?

646
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,580
No.

647
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,180
He didn't lay a finger on me.

648
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,090
Jae Won is a pacifist.

649
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,219
Getting hit would've been better.

650
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,260
Look what he's done.

651
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:18,830
Noh Se.

652
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,630
- We'll protect you from now on.
- What?

653
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,470
Protect me from what?

654
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,600
No, it's okay.

655
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:28,640
I'm Chief of Security from now on.

656
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:31,309
- Chief of what?
- What did he say?

657
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:33,580
What on earth is he talking about?

658
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,480
Don't laugh, you jerks.

659
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:37,850
This includes you.

660
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,620
You too, Kim Gi Jae.

661
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,780
- Me?
- What?

662
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,150
Are you kidding me? Chief of Security, my foot.

663
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,420
What did you say?

664
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,620
I was only kidding.

665
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:49,730
Looking forward to working with you, Han Byeol.

666
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,430
Let's work together.

667
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:54,199
This is great.

668
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,729
That's awesome.

669
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:56,899
That's great.

670
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,300
Now that we got together, let's do a cheer.

671
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,700
Let's do this.

672
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:06,079
Let's not fight. One, two, three.

673
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,610
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

674
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:11,210
- Let's try to get along.
- All right.

675
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,680
"A disciplinary committee with student participation?"

676
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,420
My friends will loathe this.

677
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:20,060
You could be assassinated by Jae Won.

678
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,560
No, Jae Won is a nice guy.

679
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,259
This is a collection of campaign pledges from...

680
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:29,470
the 73 student council presidents who were elected last year.

681
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:31,940
"Student council presidents?"

682
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:35,039
Yes, I haven't found 100 yet,

683
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,870
but would you like to see it as a reference?

684
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,910
How did you get a hold of it?

685
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,479
When I called the schools and said that I'd like to benchmark,

686
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,750
they sent the information by email.

687
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,090
Yoon Jeong Hui, you're very impressive.

688
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,159
Would last year's campaign pledges from other schools be helpful?

689
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,090
Among the campaign pledges,

690
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,390
I ranked those that overlapped.

691
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,960
In other words, it's possible to analyze the trends.

692
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,800
I see. This is great.

693
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,270
Jeong Hui, when did you prepare all this?

694
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:06,570
I worked on it little by little at home.

695
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:12,010
Can I also look at the file that you worked on?

696
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,810
Yes, I already sent it to you by email.

697
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,780
What about me?

698
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:21,250
You can work on something else.

699
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,650
Why would two people work on the same thing and waste energy?

700
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,020
She's right, Se Hoon.

701
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,860
Leave the campaign pledges to us.

702
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,460
You can work on...

703
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,100
Could you check out spots for the banners during the campaign?

704
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:37,830
Right now.

705
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,800
Okay.

706
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:42,270
That's also important. You know that, right?

707
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,610
(Drama Club Room)

708
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,380
- This one is nice.
- Isn't it stylish?

709
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,379
They didn't have much time,

710
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,020
but the quality is higher than I expected.

711
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,049
This campaign is going to be very tough.

712
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:59,920
I know. On top of that, Yang Won Dae got in trouble.

713
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:01,789
(A premium school, a premium president!)

714
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,159
(Kwak Sang Hyeon)

715
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,160
These look stylish.

716
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,560
Se Hoon.

717
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,230
Yes?

718
00:39:07,231 --> 00:39:09,300
Hyeon Jin had planned it out all along.

719
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:10,970
You made all that effort for nothing.

720
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:18,170
- Power.
- Look at this.

721
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,710
Guys.

722
00:39:21,711 --> 00:39:22,949
(Noh Se Hoon is the best.)

723
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,080
Isn't this nice too?

724
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,080
It's also slightly retro.

725
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,349
Se Hoon made it.

726
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:29,850
Retro, my foot. It looks terrible.

727
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,720
What on earth is that?

728
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,960
We aren't in elementary school.

729
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,990
Who would carry something like that?

730
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:44,270
Hey, Noh Se Hoon.

731
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,070
What is it?

732
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,170
If you're going to make things like that, let's work together.

733
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,440
Things like what?

734
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,940
What you made yesterday.

735
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:53,380
What about yourself?

736
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,810
You did everything including the statistics.

737
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:57,550
Are you desperate to be recognized?

738
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:59,720
Let's say you did all that work,

739
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,449
but you only sent the email to Sang Hyeon.

740
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:02,819
You left me out on purpose.

741
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,789
Actually, that was because...

742
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:05,820
What?

743
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:09,330
Your name was written on it underneath the graph.

744
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:10,760
My name?

745
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,399
Why would it be there?

746
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,370
I meant to submit it like we worked on it together.

747
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:19,000
Once I got all 100 schools.

748
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:21,340
Like we worked on it together?

749
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:23,410
Yes.

750
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,180
You're lying.

751
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,709
It didn't seem that way at all.

752
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,579
You wanted to show off your work so much...

753
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,219
that your eyes almost bulged out.

754
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,889
Don't be ridiculous.

755
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,349
If people don't like it,

756
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:40,989
weren't you going to pretend like we worked on it together?

757
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,060
Like a selfish brat?

758
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,160
You're right.

759
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,500
You're smarter than I thought.

760
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Why you...

761
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:53,000
Anyway, stop turning this into some kind of rivalry.

762
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,340
When did I do that?

763
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,010
Don't deny it. It's totally obvious.

764
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,680
You're ridiculous. There's no rivalry.

765
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,580
That's true. Rivalry is impossible between us.

766
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,380
It's so absurd that I don't know what to say.

767
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:06,079
Right, you should...

768
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,179
cut down on your useless talk.

769
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,189
"Useless talk?"

770
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,350
That, for example.

771
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:13,689
Think hard before complaining.

772
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:14,720
Goodness.

773
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,990
Wait, do you like me?

774
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,660
Actually,

775
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,470
it's closer to pity or disdain than anything else.

776
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,770
I don't believe this.

777
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,470
Hey.

778
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,949
The mastermind of a phone financial fraud, commonly known...

779
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:44,920
as voice phishing, has been apprehended by a brave citizen.

780
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:47,689
Mr. Kwon, who had been evading the investigation, was injured...

781
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:50,629
in a crash with a truck during drowsy driving.

782
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,959
- It's been a long time, right?
- He was spotted...

783
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,429
by a high school student...

784
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:57,369
- A high school student?
- on the street in Seocho-gu, Seoul.

785
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:59,499
Inside Mr. Kwon's vehicle,

786
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,699
the high school student discovered...

787
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,669
a portable repeater and several mobile phones.

788
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,309
He reported to the police.

789
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:06,909
The police recognized the brave action of a junior...

790
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:09,049
at Youngjin High School...

791
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:11,879
that played a decisive role in capturing the suspect.

792
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,019
They awarded him the citizen police award.

793
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,989
Even if it hadn't been me,

794
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:20,289
anyone present at the scene would've done the same.

795
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:23,389
I feel proud and honoured to received...

796
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:26,030
the citizen police award.

797
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:40,740
I thought that he had gotten in trouble out of anger.

798
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:41,980
I was worried.

799
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,020
Now that the problem is resolved,

800
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,350
it might have been easier if he had gotten in trouble.

801
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:54,860
Sang Hyeon.

802
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:56,490
We were worried for nothing.

803
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,660
You're right.

804
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:04,700
Why do you look so upset?

805
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:09,170
The worst part is...

806
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:12,380
the feeling of concern I had for Yang Won Dae was...

807
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:14,840
actually jealousy.

808
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,450
Goodness, he looks so happy.

809
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:19,080
He's having a blast.

810
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,250
You lose if you feel jealous.

811
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:27,960
Let's go.

812
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:32,560
- Yang Won Dae.
- Yang Won Dae.

813
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:36,630
One, two, three.

814
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:38,170
Number two.

815
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:42,139
- Yang Won Dae.
- Yang Won Dae.

816
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:45,139
- Yang Won Dae.
- Yang Won Dae.

817
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:48,139
- Yang Won Dae.
- Yang Won Dae.

818

(Episode 3: A Star is Born)

819
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:50,780
- Yang Won Dae.
- Yang Won Dae.
