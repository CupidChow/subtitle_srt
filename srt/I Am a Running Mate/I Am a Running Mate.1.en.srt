For three weeks after the allegations were raised,

72

he took to social media and criticized the party...

73
00:04:04,382 --> 00:04:06,482
for portraying him as a lawbreaker.

of fostering division among the people,

76
00:04:13,692 --> 00:04:15,562

Wearing underwear...

103
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:22,962
keeps everything comfortably in place.

104
00:05:23,692 --> 00:05:25,792
So, if something like that happened,

105
00:05:26,902 --> 00:05:28,002
it means...

106
00:05:29,702 --> 00:05:32,102

107
00:05:32,802 --> 00:05:34,902
Stop, okay? I'm going to report you.

108
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:38,712

- Get lost. Are you crazy?

140
00:06:55,922 --> 00:06:57,392
They look monstrous!

141
00:06:57,522 --> 00:06:59,421
- You crazy punk.
- Touch them.

00:09:19,832 --> 00:09:21,302
Everyone will forget about it in no time.

182
00:09:24,402 --> 00:09:27,602
I heard you were the student council president in elementary school.

183
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,702
- Is it true?
- Yes.

184
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:31,412
Why didn't I know about it?

185
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:33,072
Sorry, I had no idea.

186
00:09:33,212 --> 00:09:34,882
Don't worry about it. I was a kid back then.

187
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:37,612
Exactly. I guess you were popular back in elementary school.

188
00:09:38,352 --> 00:09:40,582
A little, I guess.

189
00:09:40,752 --> 00:09:42,382
So, what happened to you?

190
00:09:43,722 --> 00:09:44,752
Sorry?

191
00:09:47,662 --> 00:09:48,822
Do you want to give it a go again?

192
00:09:50,562 --> 00:09:51,632
What do you mean?

193
00:09:52,462 --> 00:09:53,801
The student council.

194
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,302
(Youngjin High School Student Council)

195
00:09:55,332 --> 00:09:57,202
Me?

196
00:09:57,732 --> 00:09:58,772
Yes.

197
00:10:00,172 --> 00:10:01,372
Let's run in the election as a team.

198
00:10:02,242 --> 00:10:03,942
Me as president, and you as vice president.

199
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:06,272
It'll be a great chance to recover your reputation too.

200
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:11,382
But why me, of all people?

201
00:10:12,482 --> 00:10:15,052
Hey, if not you, then who?

202
00:10:15,952 --> 00:10:17,251
We're both in the choir.

203
00:10:17,252 --> 00:10:18,321
You served as student president in elementary school,

204
00:10:18,322 --> 00:10:19,452
and you get good grades too.

205
00:10:20,022 --> 00:10:22,222
And you can get hard easily, which is a sign of good health.

206
00:10:22,362 --> 00:10:24,092
Gosh, no.

207
00:10:27,062 --> 00:10:28,162
Se Hoon.

208
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:29,862
You think I wouldn't know?

209
00:10:31,102 --> 00:10:33,742
You're always the first to arrive and clean before choir practice.

210
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:37,542
Yes.

211
00:10:37,942 --> 00:10:40,281
See? I won't find anyone...

212
00:10:40,282 --> 00:10:42,042
more diligent and trustworthy than you.

213
00:10:43,712 --> 00:10:44,782
Come on.

214
00:10:45,352 --> 00:10:46,382
You don't want to do it?

215
00:10:46,952 --> 00:10:48,422
Do you not want to run in the election with me?

216
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,452
It's not that.

217
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:52,992
Can I do a good job?

218
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:55,192
I haven't done it in so long.

219
00:10:55,762 --> 00:10:56,832
My gosh.

220
00:10:58,862 --> 00:11:00,232
Hey, Noh Se Hoon.

221
00:11:02,502 --> 00:11:03,902
You have no reason to be intimidated.

222
00:11:04,972 --> 00:11:06,272
Just follow my lead.

223
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:08,872
I'm the vice president right now, you know.

224
00:11:09,272 --> 00:11:10,342
Okay?

225
00:11:12,142 --> 00:11:14,011
Then, sure.

226
00:11:14,012 --> 00:11:15,082
So, you're in.

227
00:11:16,482 --> 00:11:17,552
Yes, sure thing.

228
00:11:18,112 --> 00:11:19,112
Nice.

229
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,252
Hey. Honestly, I don't care about the other kids.

230
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:26,822
I noticed your potential.

231
00:11:27,822 --> 00:11:29,522
- Potential?
- Yes.

232
00:11:30,032 --> 00:11:31,832
Even if you're buried now, like an awl,

233
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:34,962
you're bound to pierce through and emerge.

234
00:11:40,002 --> 00:11:41,142
"Brilliance always finds a way..."

235
00:11:43,442 --> 00:11:44,442
"to shine."

236
00:11:44,443 --> 00:11:46,212
Yes, exactly.

237
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:51,952
You know, those kids who call you Mr. Hard-on and stuff.

238
00:11:53,552 --> 00:11:56,222
Just ignore them once you become vice president, okay?

239
00:11:56,922 --> 00:11:57,922
Okay!

240
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:01,762
Oh, no.

241
00:12:02,462 --> 00:12:03,932
Wait!

242
00:12:09,232 --> 00:12:10,272
Thank you.

243
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:23,182
Being recognized by someone...

244
00:12:24,082 --> 00:12:25,612
fills you with joy.

245
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:35,862
- It greets the girl - It greets the girl

246
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:39,792
Last night, I came up with a plan.

247
00:12:40,662 --> 00:12:42,431
First, I'm going to get elected vice president...

248
00:12:42,432 --> 00:12:44,332
and bring back discipline to the school.

249
00:12:44,502 --> 00:12:46,032
Then I'll tell Ha Yu Gyeong how I feel.

250
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,441
Yes, it's perfect.

251
00:12:48,442 --> 00:12:50,442
Hey, you pervert.

252
00:12:52,812 --> 00:12:53,912
Hey, Mr. Hard-on.

253
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:56,112
Mr. Hard-on, you need to see this.

254
00:12:58,212 --> 00:13:01,622
- Thinking of spring and singing - Thinking of spring and singing

255
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,192
You're not getting this back.

256
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,262
Give it back, you jerk.

257
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:12,892
- Give it back!
- Hey.

258
00:13:15,102 --> 00:13:17,132
Hey, enough chitchat, you two.

259
00:13:17,532 --> 00:13:18,532
Sorry.

260
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:19,672
Stay after practice, both of you.

261
00:13:24,172 --> 00:13:25,172
Goodness.

262
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:28,882
Hurry up. I want to finish this quickly and go home.

263
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:33,212
Hey.

264
00:13:33,452 --> 00:13:35,821
Are you going to keep showing everyone that photo of me...

265
00:13:35,822 --> 00:13:36,822
getting slapped?

266
00:13:37,292 --> 00:13:38,352
Yes, of course.

267
00:13:39,722 --> 00:13:41,221
Why, what are you going to do about it?

268
00:13:41,222 --> 00:13:42,992
It's your fault for letting that photo be taken.

269
00:13:43,632 --> 00:13:45,632
Just wait and see what happens, then.

270
00:13:46,632 --> 00:13:49,502
Hey, loser. Why are you acting all serious? You're so annoying.

271
00:13:52,602 --> 00:13:53,642
Hold it properly.

272
00:13:54,642 --> 00:13:55,802
You two, you're still not done?

273
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:57,412
Hey!

274
00:13:57,572 --> 00:13:58,812
No, not yet.

275
00:13:58,842 --> 00:14:00,842
Se Hoon, we should talk about our campaign pledge.

276
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:02,882
Right.

277
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:04,712
Come on. Let's talk now.

278
00:14:05,982 --> 00:14:07,282
You can finish up, Gyeong Tae.

279
00:14:09,022 --> 00:14:10,052
Okay.

280
00:14:11,322 --> 00:14:12,322
I'm off.

281
00:14:12,822 --> 00:14:13,892
Darn you.

282
00:14:18,032 --> 00:14:19,261
(Jung Yong Academy)

283
00:14:19,262 --> 00:14:21,301
Hey, what's up? Where are you going?

284
00:14:21,302 --> 00:14:22,832
Hey, Noh Se!

285
00:14:25,702 --> 00:14:29,002
My, you're glowing.

286
00:14:29,172 --> 00:14:31,512
So, you're teaming up with the choir captain to run in the election?

287
00:14:31,712 --> 00:14:32,942
With Won Dae.

288
00:14:33,642 --> 00:14:34,812
Has the word spread already?

289
00:14:34,912 --> 00:14:36,742
Yes, it sure has.

290
00:14:37,312 --> 00:14:39,752
That Mr. Hard-on is entering the election.

291
00:14:40,722 --> 00:14:42,422
Shut it, loser.

292
00:14:42,922 --> 00:14:44,922
Oh, my. The student council?

293
00:14:45,692 --> 00:14:47,022
Are there perks for doing that?

294
00:14:47,392 --> 00:14:48,792
I feel like it'll be a huge hassle.

295
00:14:49,162 --> 00:14:50,432
I'm not in it for the perks.

296
00:14:51,132 --> 00:14:52,492
Won Dae said...

297
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,862
it had to be me.

298
00:14:54,932 --> 00:14:56,132
That's why I'm doing it.

299
00:14:56,302 --> 00:14:58,431
Right, you do have the experience from elementary school.

300
00:14:58,432 --> 00:14:59,432
That's right.

301
00:15:00,742 --> 00:15:01,772
Hey.

302
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:05,112
Can you give me a position too?

303
00:15:05,542 --> 00:15:07,542
You? No. You've engaged in too many corrupt activities.

304
00:15:07,982 --> 00:15:09,382
Corrupt activities, my foot.

305
00:15:09,412 --> 00:15:11,181
Hey, once I start talking,

306
00:15:11,182 --> 00:15:13,752
you'll get impeached right away, jerk.

307
00:15:13,922 --> 00:15:16,121
I have to be elected first before I can be impeached.

308
00:15:16,122 --> 00:15:17,691
The election hasn't even happened yet.

309
00:15:17,692 --> 00:15:19,892
Hey, it's a done deal.

310
00:15:19,922 --> 00:15:21,421
Won Dae is very popular.

311
00:15:21,422 --> 00:15:22,962
All the teachers like him too.

312
00:15:23,492 --> 00:15:25,661
I heard the principal had a family gathering...

313
00:15:25,662 --> 00:15:27,332
at his parents' restaurant recently.

314
00:15:27,462 --> 00:15:28,862
That restaurant is famous.

315
00:15:29,502 --> 00:15:32,231
Hey, how do you know these things?

316
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:34,442
Oh, come on. I'm in so many group chats.

317
00:15:36,342 --> 00:15:38,042
Hey, congratulations.

318
00:15:40,142 --> 00:15:41,712
But I don't want to go to a college in the middle of nowhere.

319
00:15:46,652 --> 00:15:47,682
Oh, my.

320
00:15:47,852 --> 00:15:49,351
Hey, Noh Se.

321
00:15:49,352 --> 00:15:52,352
Maybe you'll get a girlfriend once you get elected.

322
00:15:53,862 --> 00:15:56,262
Hey, will you date Ha Yu Gyeong, then?

323
00:15:57,262 --> 00:15:58,861
Watch what you say, loser.

324
00:15:58,862 --> 00:16:00,832
Don't go around starting scandals.

325
00:16:00,902 --> 00:16:01,932
"Scandals?"

326
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,732
Look at you acting like a celebrity.

327
00:16:04,772 --> 00:16:06,472
You're just the hard-on guy.

328
00:16:06,672 --> 00:16:07,702
Darn you!

329
00:16:08,872 --> 00:16:10,612
Mr. Hard-on is acting like a celebrity?

330
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:15,712
What?

331
00:16:16,512 --> 00:16:17,682
Hello, Sang Hyeon.

332
00:16:18,212 --> 00:16:19,412
Hi.

333
00:16:21,182 --> 00:16:23,692
So, you're that famous Noh Se Hoon.

334
00:16:26,492 --> 00:16:27,522
Kwak Sang Hyeon.

335
00:16:27,892 --> 00:16:29,292
The most popular guy in my neighbourhood.

336
00:16:29,492 --> 00:16:31,392
A walking style icon.

337
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:32,932
Do you go to an academy around here?

338
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,932
Yes, we go to Jung Yong Academy.

339
00:16:35,002 --> 00:16:36,002
I see.

340
00:16:36,332 --> 00:16:38,702
Even someone like him knows me.

341
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,172
It must be because of that photo.

342
00:16:41,842 --> 00:16:42,872
Have you eaten yet?

343
00:16:47,482 --> 00:16:48,642
Is this your dinner?

344
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:50,042
Is this enough food for you?

345
00:16:52,382 --> 00:16:53,452
Do you like chicken?

346
00:16:53,822 --> 00:16:55,482
- We have to...
- Yes, we love it.

347
00:16:56,252 --> 00:16:58,022
Let's go. I know a great fried chicken spot.

348
00:16:58,692 --> 00:17:00,292
Chicken? Fried chicken?

349
00:17:01,222 --> 00:17:03,522
All hot guys love chicken.

350
00:17:05,632 --> 00:17:07,031
- Hello.
- Hi.

351
00:17:07,032 --> 00:17:09,002
Seeing how they're suddenly acting friendly with me,

352
00:17:09,432 --> 00:17:11,772
I bet they heard about me running in the election.

353
00:17:12,272 --> 00:17:13,501
He's so handsome and tall.

354
00:17:13,502 --> 00:17:15,542
I can't be swayed by mere fried chicken.

355
00:17:15,772 --> 00:17:18,742
Yes, especially free fried chicken. It's so dangerous.

356
00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:21,482
The moment I take a bite,

357
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:24,452
I'll get asked for a favour I can't refuse.

358
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:25,712
Noh Se!

359
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:27,481
Hurry up, loser!

360
00:17:27,482 --> 00:17:30,052
I am coming. Be quiet, okay?

361
00:17:30,222 --> 00:17:31,752
Come on, loser.

362
00:17:32,492 --> 00:17:34,492
My gosh. Where is he taking us?

363
00:17:34,922 --> 00:17:36,562
Kyochon? BBQ?

364
00:17:36,962 --> 00:17:38,462
BHC?

365
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:40,332
BHC's Prinkle is so good.

366
00:17:40,702 --> 00:17:41,731
Or is it Gcova?

367
00:17:41,732 --> 00:17:43,462
Their chicken tastes best with rice.

368
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,701
Or is it Nene?

369
00:17:44,702 --> 00:17:46,872
Or Goobne? Chilli Pepper Crunch?

370
00:17:47,842 --> 00:17:49,202
My gosh.

371
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,272
Do you know Korea has the most seasoned fried chicken?

372
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:54,812
Do you know who first created the yangnyeom chicken?

373
00:17:54,942 --> 00:17:56,941
Back in 1980, Daegu resident Yoon Jong Gye...

374
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,011
Do you know...

375
00:17:58,012 --> 00:17:59,652
the chicken skewers here are to die for?

376
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,282
Let's go inside and eat.

377
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:04,592
- Ma'am.
- Yes, hello.

378
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:13,492
He likes chicken a great deal.

379
00:18:15,832 --> 00:18:18,002
Yes. He's a chicken fanatic.

380
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,912
What is wrong with that punk?

381
00:18:24,512 --> 00:18:25,612
He's an embarrassment.

382
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,042
But then, this isn't fried chicken.

383
00:18:29,912 --> 00:18:32,452
A few chicken skewers are fine, right?

384
00:18:33,052 --> 00:18:34,922
They're not for me. They're for him.

385
00:18:35,922 --> 00:18:38,322
You have such a hearty appetite.

386
00:18:38,922 --> 00:18:41,062
- Thank you.
- Have some more.

387
00:18:41,322 --> 00:18:43,321
- Hello, Sang Hyeon.
- Hi.

388
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,262
- Hello.
- Hi.

389
00:18:45,632 --> 00:18:47,732
- Hey, Sang Hyeon.
- Hey.

390
00:18:48,532 --> 00:18:50,832
Who are they? We haven't met.

391
00:18:52,032 --> 00:18:54,942
Well, he's...

392
00:18:56,772 --> 00:18:57,842
my little bro?

393
00:18:58,712 --> 00:18:59,912
They're my friends.

394
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,011
- Hello.
- Hi.

395
00:19:03,012 --> 00:19:04,112
- Hello.
- Hi.

396
00:19:05,012 --> 00:19:08,121
Ma'am, can we have three cans of Welch's?

397
00:19:08,122 --> 00:19:10,022
- Yes, sure.
- There's a new guy.

398
00:19:11,722 --> 00:19:13,222
- Here.
- Thank you.

399
00:19:19,662 --> 00:19:22,762
I might have been a bit arrogant at first.

400
00:19:23,532 --> 00:19:27,002
But this guy didn't mind that much.

401
00:19:27,242 --> 00:19:28,272
Isn't this cute?

402
00:19:28,472 --> 00:19:30,611
We spent over an hour...

403
00:19:30,612 --> 00:19:31,871
- talking...
- For real?

404
00:19:31,872 --> 00:19:33,212
- about nonsense.
- For real.

405
00:19:33,942 --> 00:19:35,711
- My gosh.
- We got along...

406
00:19:35,712 --> 00:19:37,042
surprisingly well.

407
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:41,982
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

408
00:19:42,352 --> 00:19:44,152
The only connection we had...

409
00:19:44,322 --> 00:19:46,722
was that we went to the same school.

410
00:19:47,692 --> 00:19:49,361
- Before I knew it, - The broth is amazing.

411
00:19:49,362 --> 00:19:51,031
- I was hot guy Kwak Sang Hyeon's...
- It's good.

412
00:19:51,032 --> 00:19:52,361
"little bro."

413
00:19:52,362 --> 00:19:54,261
(Open, fishcake, sundae, chicken skewers)

414
00:19:54,262 --> 00:19:55,331
(Cards not accepted, KwakKwaki, Kkang Jae Won only)

415
00:19:55,332 --> 00:19:56,861
- You're leaving?
- Yes. Bye.

416
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:57,931
- See you.
- Sure.

417
00:19:57,932 --> 00:19:59,001
Have a nice evening.

418
00:19:59,002 --> 00:20:00,572
- Take care.
- See you again soon.

419
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:03,641
- Did you enjoy that?
- Yes.

420
00:20:03,642 --> 00:20:04,841
Yes, I enjoyed that.

421
00:20:04,842 --> 00:20:07,311
Oh, right. Jung Yong Academy.

422
00:20:07,312 --> 00:20:10,041
If you want to take another class, talk to Chief No.

423
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,312
Drop my name and you'll get a seat in the popular classes.

424
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:13,851
Okay, Sang Hyeon.

425
00:20:13,852 --> 00:20:15,082
And you, Ji Hun.

426
00:20:15,522 --> 00:20:17,752
Don't vape in the neighbourhood.

427
00:20:17,952 --> 00:20:19,392
Especially not near the academy.

428
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,692
- Okay.
- Mr. Sin said...

429
00:20:21,892 --> 00:20:23,762
he put a team together to crack down on vapers.

430
00:20:24,192 --> 00:20:25,262
Okay.

431
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,662
Okay, then. I'm off. See you around.

432
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:29,462
- Thanks for the food.
- Sure.

433
00:20:29,602 --> 00:20:31,802
He's no style icon.

434
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:34,802
How could he buy us chicken skewers?

435
00:20:38,742 --> 00:20:40,272
Didn't you eat a bit too much...

436
00:20:40,582 --> 00:20:42,182
to complain about it now?

437
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:43,682
"My little bro?"

438
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,012
He tried too hard to befriend you.

439
00:20:46,152 --> 00:20:48,052
- Do you think we're okay?
- With what?

440
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:51,252
Isn't there a law on how much you can spend to treat others?

441
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,022
What are you on about, moron?

442
00:20:54,092 --> 00:20:55,692
Don't be stupid.

443
00:20:59,662 --> 00:21:01,032
You've eaten enough.

444
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,571
Good luck with the presentations.

445
00:21:05,572 --> 00:21:06,601
That's it for today.

446
00:21:06,602 --> 00:21:08,642
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

447
00:21:09,972 --> 00:21:11,611
Can you lend me yours?

448
00:21:11,612 --> 00:21:12,872
Don't you dare.

449
00:21:17,512 --> 00:21:19,182
- What's up with him?
- What was that?

450
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:21,521
- Is that him?
- Yes.

451
00:21:21,522 --> 00:21:22,852
I don't have to broadcast...

452
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,852
I need to take a dump too.

453
00:21:38,932 --> 00:21:39,932
What's going on?

454
00:21:41,002 --> 00:21:42,272
Why did you come up here?

455
00:21:42,442 --> 00:21:44,442
I needed to go to the toilet.

456
00:21:46,942 --> 00:21:48,982
Hey. Who's he?

457
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:50,182
It's nothing.

458
00:21:50,682 --> 00:21:52,082
He's a nobody.

459
00:21:52,252 --> 00:21:54,082
"A nobody?"

460
00:21:55,682 --> 00:21:58,122
Hey, you. Go somewhere else.

461
00:21:58,592 --> 00:21:59,922
Don't loaf about here.

462
00:22:06,062 --> 00:22:07,192
Choi Jong Su.

463
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:09,102
To be honest,

464
00:22:09,262 --> 00:22:12,031
in elementary school, he was the nobody who was shorter than me.

465
00:22:12,032 --> 00:22:13,102
(Choi Jong Su)

466
00:22:13,272 --> 00:22:15,302
Now even punks like him look down on me?

467
00:22:17,242 --> 00:22:18,272
This won't do.

468
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:20,881
We need a pledge that will take care of...

469
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:22,012
bullies like them.

470
00:22:22,912 --> 00:22:23,942
Wait.

471
00:22:44,102 --> 00:22:46,172
I warned you so many times.

472
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:48,642
That was humiliating in front of the boys.

473
00:22:49,842 --> 00:22:51,912
Okay. We'll be more careful.

474
00:22:54,042 --> 00:22:56,042
Don't just be more careful.

475
00:22:57,652 --> 00:22:59,452
Don't smoke at school.

476
00:23:03,152 --> 00:23:04,192
Hey.

477
00:23:05,022 --> 00:23:07,592
Don't stand there like you're a bunch of thugs.

478
00:23:07,862 --> 00:23:08,922
Sorry.

479
00:23:09,862 --> 00:23:11,392
What the heck is this?

480
00:23:14,262 --> 00:23:15,262
Se Hoon.

481
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:16,962
What are you doing there?

482
00:23:19,032 --> 00:23:20,402
Hello, Sang Hyeon.

483
00:23:24,312 --> 00:23:25,472
Why are you over here?

484
00:23:25,872 --> 00:23:27,212
I had business.

485
00:23:29,182 --> 00:23:30,211
I get it.

486
00:23:30,212 --> 00:23:31,212
(Noh Se Hoon)

487
00:23:31,213 --> 00:23:33,482
The toilets here are on the quiet side.

488
00:23:35,422 --> 00:23:36,682
What's your next class?

489
00:23:38,592 --> 00:23:39,622
It's math.

490
00:23:39,692 --> 00:23:41,422
Oh, with Ms. Jeong An?

491
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:42,792
Yes.

492
00:23:45,032 --> 00:23:46,692
Who's that punk?

493
00:23:47,732 --> 00:23:48,801
Oh, right.

494
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,732
You'll run for office with Yang Won Dae?

495
00:23:51,632 --> 00:23:53,001
- Yes.
- Gosh.

496
00:23:53,002 --> 00:23:55,072
You're ambitious like that?

497
00:23:55,302 --> 00:23:57,742
No, I'm not ambitious.

498
00:23:58,042 --> 00:24:00,072
We're both in the school choir,

499
00:24:00,212 --> 00:24:02,482
and so we decided to...

500
00:24:02,512 --> 00:24:04,251
get together...

501
00:24:04,252 --> 00:24:06,112
to represent our school.

502
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:09,352
He'll represent our school?

503
00:24:11,092 --> 00:24:12,122
Who, Yang Won Dae?

504
00:24:12,692 --> 00:24:13,692
What?

505
00:24:14,992 --> 00:24:16,062
Never mind.

506
00:24:16,892 --> 00:24:17,892
Let's walk.

507
00:24:32,942 --> 00:24:34,912
Just because I'd become a candidate,

508
00:24:35,582 --> 00:24:37,582
my pool of connections expanded.

509
00:24:38,612 --> 00:24:40,952
Because Won Dae chose me,

510
00:24:41,452 --> 00:24:43,352
the sun began to shine...

511
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,292
on my lagging school life.

512
00:24:47,092 --> 00:24:48,462
That's why they say...

513
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,262
brilliance finds a way to shine.

514
00:24:54,062 --> 00:24:56,432
(2023 2nd Term Midterm Report Card, Noh Se Hoon)

515
00:24:58,172 --> 00:24:59,272
What's your grade?

516
00:25:00,272 --> 00:25:02,742
You broadcast to the school that the midterm was easy-peasy.

517
00:25:03,472 --> 00:25:05,012
Who broadcast to the school?

518
00:25:05,112 --> 00:25:06,212
What now?

519
00:25:06,612 --> 00:25:08,612
You'll have even less time to study if you become vice president.

520
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:09,882
You're screwed.

521
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:11,282
You'll have to resit the CSAT.

522
00:25:12,252 --> 00:25:14,381
Hey. Why would I have to resit the CSAT?

523
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:15,822
Don't jinx me, you piece of crap.

524
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:19,191
What's the matter with you?

525
00:25:19,192 --> 00:25:21,622
Why did you get so upset about a joke?

526
00:25:22,092 --> 00:25:23,892
You think you're all that because you got good grades?

527
00:25:24,432 --> 00:25:25,462
Hey.

528
00:25:25,892 --> 00:25:27,462
You'll punch me if you become vice president.

529
00:25:27,632 --> 00:25:29,532
Guys. What's the matter?

530
00:25:31,432 --> 00:25:33,202
I can't stand Mr. Hard-on.

531
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,742
You're dead annoying.

532
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:39,942
What's his problem?

533
00:25:41,012 --> 00:25:42,082
I don't know.

534
00:25:42,612 --> 00:25:44,552
He annoyed the heck out of me.

535
00:25:44,652 --> 00:25:45,712
That's impressive.

536
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:47,922
Your grades dropped and now you're 12th in our year?

537
00:25:48,152 --> 00:25:49,422
Not 12th in your class?

538
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:51,392
My mom would murder me...

539
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:53,192
if I were 12th in my class.

540
00:25:55,392 --> 00:25:56,422
Come on.

541
00:25:56,862 --> 00:25:57,932
How about...

542
00:25:58,092 --> 00:26:00,562
I help you out a bit?

543
00:26:00,662 --> 00:26:01,662
What?

544
00:26:01,663 --> 00:26:03,402
- Ta-da.
- What's this?

545
00:26:03,602 --> 00:26:04,772
Your grades went up?

546
00:26:05,032 --> 00:26:06,232
Of course not.

548
00:26:08,242 --> 00:26:12,012
This column here. I changed all the numbers.

549
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,142
This is...

550
00:26:13,642 --> 00:26:15,382
You forged your report card.

551
00:26:15,512 --> 00:26:16,942
It's not forgery.

552
00:26:17,512 --> 00:26:19,582
It's an insurance of sorts.

553
00:26:19,752 --> 00:26:21,482
We're still in our first year.

554
00:26:22,882 --> 00:26:24,352
We can do better next time.

555
00:26:26,622 --> 00:26:28,822
Shoot. It does look pretty real.

556
00:26:29,262 --> 00:26:31,532
What do you say? Do you want one too?

557
00:26:33,032 --> 00:26:34,062
No.

558
00:26:35,002 --> 00:26:36,302
It must be good to be you.

559
00:26:36,702 --> 00:26:38,701
You get to slack off and enjoy life...

560
00:26:38,702 --> 00:26:39,702
and forge your report card.

561
00:26:40,472 --> 00:26:43,172
No, it's not like that at all.

562
00:26:43,342 --> 00:26:47,012
My heart is always heavy.

563
00:26:47,142 --> 00:26:48,412
Forget it.

564
00:26:49,142 --> 00:26:50,442
You really won't go?

565
00:26:51,012 --> 00:26:53,012
Sang Hyeon did us a favour.

566
00:26:53,082 --> 00:26:54,981
No. I won't go.

I can take Kevin's class...

571
00:27:09,202 --> 00:27:10,762
Sang Hyeon's so awesome.

572
00:27:11,432 --> 00:27:12,802
He has some connections.

573
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:15,002
Okay.

574
00:27:16,042 --> 00:27:17,401
The class was full,

575
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:18,872
but Sang Hyeon sent you.

576
00:27:19,772 --> 00:27:22,382
Don't tell anyone else at school.

577
00:27:22,812 --> 00:27:24,812
- Do you get my drift?
- Yes.

578
00:27:25,382 --> 00:27:26,482
I will...

579
00:27:27,382 --> 00:27:28,752
pay for the class with this.

580
00:27:29,252 --> 00:27:30,352
You'll pay?

581
00:27:31,492 --> 00:27:34,292
Well, we do need to leave a record.

582
00:27:34,962 --> 00:27:35,962
Thanks.

583
00:27:45,102 --> 00:27:46,302
Give this to your parents.

584
00:27:47,842 --> 00:27:49,172
The textbook's free of charge.

585
00:27:49,772 --> 00:27:51,541
- What?
- It's fine.

586
00:27:51,542 --> 00:27:52,912
You're Sang Hyeon's little bro.

587
00:27:53,112 --> 00:27:54,542
Hurry on. The class starts soon.

588
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:58,452
- Thank you.
- Sure.

589

00:28:12,932 --> 00:28:13,932
Hi, guys.

592
00:28:13,933 --> 00:28:15,502
- Hello.
- Hello.

593
00:28:15,532 --> 00:28:17,832
You and I met today,

594
00:28:18,732 --> 00:28:21,572
and it's the beginning of change. It's what?

595
00:28:21,802 --> 00:28:23,442
- The beginning of change.
- The beginning of change.

596
00:28:23,642 --> 00:28:24,672
Good.

597
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:26,612
Shall we see if you're ready?

598
00:28:28,112 --> 00:28:29,882
Do you want a chance to change the world?

599
00:28:31,012 --> 00:28:32,051
Yes.

600
00:28:32,052 --> 00:28:34,452
You're ready. Your engine is warmed up.

601
00:28:35,752 --> 00:28:36,822
Let's see.

602
00:28:37,252 --> 00:28:38,322
You.

603
00:28:38,722 --> 00:28:40,622
Do you want a chance to change the world?

604
00:28:41,362 --> 00:28:44,531
Of course. Living 17 years until now,

605
00:28:44,532 --> 00:28:46,232
I think it's unfair...

606
00:28:46,262 --> 00:28:50,702
and totally a lonely life to be on top all by myself.

607
00:28:50,932 --> 00:28:53,871
So I think changing the whole system...

608
00:28:53,872 --> 00:28:56,272
of this country will be the answer.

609
00:28:56,342 --> 00:28:59,311
To do this, I've always been on top in school.

610
00:28:59,312 --> 00:29:00,411
- Okay.
- And one day,

611
00:29:00,412 --> 00:29:02,611
I will be the leader of this country...

612
00:29:02,612 --> 00:29:05,181
and change everything.

613
00:29:05,182 --> 00:29:07,952
Oh, my gosh. You came prepared.

614
00:29:08,152 --> 00:29:09,422
That's a nice answer.

615
00:29:13,322 --> 00:29:14,462
Did you all get that?

616
00:29:14,592 --> 00:29:15,622
- No.
- No.

617
00:29:16,022 --> 00:29:17,062
That's impressive.

618
00:29:17,662 --> 00:29:19,362
- That class blew.
- It did.

619
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:21,561
- What about a snack?
- Tteokbokki?

620
00:29:21,562 --> 00:29:22,802
Shall we get tteokbokki?

621
00:29:22,902 --> 00:29:23,902
Hey!

622
00:29:24,732 --> 00:29:25,772
You!

623
00:29:26,032 --> 00:29:27,202
That witch.

624
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:29,202
She walked into us on purpose.

625
00:29:29,342 --> 00:29:31,112
Yoon Jeong Hui that frog.

626
00:29:31,642 --> 00:29:33,571
- She didn't even apologize.
- No.

627
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:35,081
Did that hurt?

631
00:29:44,652 --> 00:29:45,722
Yes.

633
00:29:49,692 --> 00:29:51,992

639
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:12,412
Yes. I joined the club today.

640
00:30:12,912 --> 00:30:14,922
The head of the Parents' Association called.

641
00:30:15,882 --> 00:30:17,522
Why did they call all of a sudden?

642
00:30:18,422 --> 00:30:19,552

This kid called Kwak Sang Hyeon.

646
00:30:29,102 --> 00:30:32,272
How is he compared to Won Dae whose parents sell pork trotters?

647
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,671
- What?
- The PA head told me...

648
00:30:34,672 --> 00:30:37,041
Sang Hyeon's running to be school president too.

649
00:30:37,042 --> 00:30:38,272
What are you saying?

650
00:30:39,042 --> 00:30:42,182
Is Kwak Sang Hyeon the son of the head of the PA?

651

If you're going to enter,

652
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:47,152
it would be better to run with someone who has a better chance.

653
00:30:47,282 --> 00:30:48,781
Would the PA head's son...

654
00:30:48,782 --> 00:30:50,982
be a better partner than a restaurant owner's son?

655
00:30:51,122 --> 00:30:52,222
So what?

656
00:30:52,622 --> 00:30:54,792
You want me to betray Won Dae...

657
00:30:54,822 --> 00:30:56,192

658
00:30:56,222 --> 00:30:58,692
I'm not telling you to betray him.

686

You need to quit forging documents.

687
00:32:09,362 --> 00:32:10,662
And quit vaping too!

688
00:32:11,402 --> 00:32:13,472
I will. Don't worry.

- There.
- Nice one.

I read through the pledges you sent.

692
00:32:23,382 --> 00:32:25,452
Your experience in elementary school helped.

693
00:32:25,582 --> 00:32:26,782
You had some great ideas.

697

Yes. It's similar.

698
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:39,391
It's not because you got called...

699
00:32:39,392 --> 00:32:40,462
"Mr. Hard-on," is it?

700
00:32:40,632 --> 00:32:42,032
It's not that at all.

Do what?

- It's your birthday?

- A hazing?
- A hazing.

729
00:34:11,792 --> 00:34:14,921
- Come here and celebrate.
- Happy birthday to you

730
00:34:14,922 --> 00:34:17,292
- Stop it.
- Happy birthday to you

731
00:34:17,362 --> 00:34:19,491
- Don't!
- Happy birthday dear...

732
00:34:19,492 --> 00:34:20,492
No.

733
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:22,701
It's not my birthday.

734
00:34:22,702 --> 00:34:23,831
- What?
- It's not?

735
00:34:23,832 --> 00:34:25,701
I was hoping to get an early workout.

736
00:34:25,702 --> 00:34:27,171
- It's someone's birthday?
- Shoot.

737
00:34:27,172 --> 00:34:28,972
- Like this.
- You, come here.

738
00:34:29,072 --> 00:34:30,741
- Why me?
- Come here!

739
00:34:30,742 --> 00:34:32,071
- Let's get him!
- No!

740
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:34,712
- You're it instead.
- You're it.

741
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:36,712
A student-regulated disciplinary committee.

742
00:34:37,382 --> 00:34:39,152
So we can discipline...

743
00:34:39,212 --> 00:34:40,711
punks like them ourselves.

744
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:42,152
My gosh. That was close.

745
00:34:42,982 --> 00:34:43,982
Goodness.

746
00:34:44,892 --> 00:34:45,922
Darn it.

747
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,962
Noh Se. I won't ask for much.

748
00:34:50,462 --> 00:34:52,691
Can you give us an extra 30 minutes in the morning?

749
00:34:52,692 --> 00:34:54,562
What right do I have to do that?

750
00:34:54,732 --> 00:34:56,861
A school vice president should have that much power.

751
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:57,962
The kids will love it.

752
00:34:58,532 --> 00:34:59,572
Do you think so?

753
00:35:00,102 --> 00:35:01,572
Should I make that a pledge?

754
00:35:01,672 --> 00:35:02,672
Isn't it a good idea?

755
00:35:03,942 --> 00:35:05,242
What a joke.

756
00:35:06,412 --> 00:35:07,872
Don't pick on him this early.

757
00:35:07,912 --> 00:35:10,782
All this VP talk. Isn't it stupid?

758
00:35:11,452 --> 00:35:13,082
You act like you're a VP of a worldwide company.

759
00:35:15,652 --> 00:35:17,682
He's all prickly because of you.

760
00:35:18,152 --> 00:35:19,222
Why?

761
00:35:19,552 --> 00:35:22,261
He ran all the errands and did all the odd jobs...

762
00:35:22,262 --> 00:35:24,122
as Won Dae's right-hand man.

763
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:26,431
But Won Dae chose you to be his VP,

764
00:35:26,432 --> 00:35:28,161
and he's ticked off.

765
00:35:28,162 --> 00:35:29,502
What?

766
00:35:31,032 --> 00:35:33,402
You ended up running for office?

767
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:35,642
Yes. I'm thinking about it.

768
00:35:36,442 --> 00:35:37,442
Are you?

769
00:35:38,212 --> 00:35:39,671
He asked me too.

770
00:35:39,672 --> 00:35:41,372
That Yang Won Dae guy.

771
00:35:41,582 --> 00:35:43,841
- What?
- Don't be stupid.

772
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:45,152
Why would he ask you?

773
00:35:45,712 --> 00:35:46,712
Noh Se Hoon?

774
00:35:47,552 --> 00:35:48,552
How about a chat?

775
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,652
- See you.
- Later.

776
00:35:54,292 --> 00:35:55,322
It's true.

777
00:35:55,422 --> 00:35:57,062
He asked me to run with him.

778
00:35:57,222 --> 00:35:58,661
Why would he ask you?

779
00:35:58,662 --> 00:35:59,732
Why do you think?

780
00:35:59,762 --> 00:36:01,161
The candidates' grades...

781
00:36:01,162 --> 00:36:03,201
must reach a certain average, and he needed a grade boost.

782
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,931
The problem was that I wasn't interested...

783
00:36:04,932 --> 00:36:07,131
in a position that would put me in a sidecar.

784
00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:08,302
What are you on about?

785
00:36:09,602 --> 00:36:10,602
It's the truth.

786
00:36:11,512 --> 00:36:13,172
You know I head the Election Commission, right?

787
00:36:13,742 --> 00:36:15,212
Yes. I heard.

788
00:36:15,242 --> 00:36:18,012
I spoke with the presidential candidate yesterday.

789
00:36:18,112 --> 00:36:20,452
He spoke really highly about you.

790
00:36:20,752 --> 00:36:24,122
"Most guys with good grades are busy bragging,"

791
00:36:24,252 --> 00:36:25,891
"but he's humble and what not."

792
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,051
"He's younger, but he sometimes feels older."

793
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:29,792
He said stuff like that.

794
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:33,692
He also said that's why he regretted losing you.

795
00:36:34,632 --> 00:36:35,632
What?

796
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:39,232
Aren't you talking about Won Dae?

797
00:36:41,642 --> 00:36:44,942
Do you know the difference between "need" and "want?"

798
00:36:45,942 --> 00:36:47,642
"Need" is what you require,

799
00:36:47,942 --> 00:36:49,942
and "want" is what you desire.

800
00:36:50,182 --> 00:36:51,411
That's right.

801
00:36:51,412 --> 00:36:54,412
"Need" is a necessity and "want" is a personal preference.

802
00:36:54,552 --> 00:36:55,552
I see.

803
00:36:55,553 --> 00:36:57,251
A necessity is something like water.

804
00:36:57,252 --> 00:36:58,752
A preference is something like liquor.

805
00:36:59,192 --> 00:37:01,422
Lack of water kills you, but not lack of alcohol.

806
00:37:02,162 --> 00:37:03,222
Yes.

807
00:37:04,292 --> 00:37:07,062
You weren't his prime candidate, were you?

808
00:37:08,632 --> 00:37:10,602
Sorry? What do you mean?

809
00:37:11,332 --> 00:37:13,401
Oh, you didn't know?

810
00:37:13,402 --> 00:37:15,802
I guess Won Dae didn't tell you.

811
00:37:16,072 --> 00:37:18,541
He'd come to me early on to discuss...

812
00:37:18,542 --> 00:37:20,042
his VP candidates.

813
00:37:20,342 --> 00:37:23,042
He wanted to know the freshmen's grades.

814
00:37:23,442 --> 00:37:26,452
I shouldn't have given him that info,

815
00:37:26,612 --> 00:37:28,181
but the student council...

816
00:37:28,182 --> 00:37:29,881
must consist of smart kids...

817
00:37:29,882 --> 00:37:31,422
and look good too.

818
00:37:32,092 --> 00:37:33,092
I see.

819
00:37:33,093 --> 00:37:34,651
So I gave him...

820
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:36,922
a list of the freshmen ranked by midterm grade.

821
00:37:37,162 --> 00:37:40,061
It looked like he couldn't get anyone...

822
00:37:40,062 --> 00:37:42,632
at the top of the list to join him.

823
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:47,602
I came 12th in my year in the midterm exam.

824
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:48,971
That means...

825
00:37:48,972 --> 00:37:50,372
To Won Dae,

826
00:37:50,742 --> 00:37:52,712
you were probably...

827
00:37:52,912 --> 00:37:55,512
tenth or more on his list of candidates.

828
00:37:57,012 --> 00:37:58,012
Hey.

829
00:37:58,482 --> 00:38:00,152
If not you, then who?

830
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:01,721
We're both in the choir.

831
00:38:01,722 --> 00:38:02,851
You served as student president in elementary school,

832
00:38:02,852 --> 00:38:03,922
and you get good grades too.

833
00:38:04,352 --> 00:38:05,551
I won't find anyone...

834
00:38:05,552 --> 00:38:07,352
more diligent and trustworthy than you.

835
00:38:08,322 --> 00:38:10,222
Grades? Recognition among peers?

836
00:38:10,992 --> 00:38:12,692
I don't judge people with that.

837
00:38:13,192 --> 00:38:15,632
Hidden potential. Sincerity.

838
00:38:15,862 --> 00:38:17,102
That's what I care about.

839
00:38:18,772 --> 00:38:20,202
Actually, yesterday,

840
00:38:20,472 --> 00:38:23,102
I spoke with second-year student Kwak Sang Hyeon.

841
00:38:24,042 --> 00:38:25,771
He spoke so highly of you...

842
00:38:25,772 --> 00:38:28,542
and said he was disappointed he lost out on you.

843
00:38:29,412 --> 00:38:31,542
He seems to need a VP like you.

844
00:38:32,912 --> 00:38:34,652
So, Se Hoon.

845
00:38:36,652 --> 00:38:38,322
Let me ask you something.

846
00:38:39,122 --> 00:38:41,992
Do you want to be someone's preferential goods,

847
00:38:44,262 --> 00:38:46,162
or do you want to be someone's necessity?

848
00:39:11,792 --> 00:39:13,852
- Hello.
- Hello.

849
00:39:14,492 --> 00:39:16,092
Where's Se Hoon?

850
00:39:16,192 --> 00:39:17,192
Se Hoon?

851
00:39:17,462 --> 00:39:19,032
Mr. Sin asked to talk to him.

852
00:39:19,562 --> 00:39:20,932
He lied.

853
00:39:21,532 --> 00:39:23,832
The choir sticking together...

854
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:27,332
and me having potential was all an effing lie he told me.

855
00:39:30,002 --> 00:39:32,512
He talked as if he needed me,

856
00:39:33,242 --> 00:39:34,372
but I was...

857
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:37,042
nothing but his 12th option.

858
00:39:37,242 --> 00:39:38,282
It's fine.

859
00:39:42,622 --> 00:39:43,652
I'm on the phone.

860
00:39:47,292 --> 00:39:50,592
(Choir Captain Yang Won Dae)

861
00:40:03,872 --> 00:40:06,041
Then the whole thing burned up.

862
00:40:06,042 --> 00:40:08,982
Left and right, left and right.

863
00:40:15,722 --> 00:40:16,782
Won Dae.

864
00:40:17,452 --> 00:40:18,752
You're right.

865
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:23,962
Brilliance always finds...

866
00:40:24,162 --> 00:40:26,192
a way to shine.

867
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,632
And thank you...

868
00:40:30,902 --> 00:40:33,972
for helping me realize I'm not just your 12th option...

869
00:40:35,402 --> 00:40:38,302
but someone actually brilliant.

870
00:44:12,352 --> 00:44:18,392
(I Am A Running Mate)
