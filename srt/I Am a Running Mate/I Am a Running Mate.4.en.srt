00:00:02,305 --> 00:00:03,315
(No. 1, Noh Se Hoon)

2
00:00:04,545 --> 00:00:05,645
(No. 2, Kwak Sang Hyeon, No. 1, Noh Se Hoon, No. 2, Ha Yu Gyeong)

3
00:00:13,885 --> 00:00:17,055
(I Am A Running Mate)

4
00:00:17,895 --> 00:00:19,795
- Look at the time.
- Why isn't anyone here?

5
00:00:23,492 --> 00:00:25,361
Now, starting today,

6
00:00:25,362 --> 00:00:28,032
let us be fully equipped with the spirit of a spy.

7
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:31,032
Hide in restrooms to eavesdrop on kids talking behind people's back...

8
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:33,742
and take screenshots of the sentiment on the Internet.

9
00:00:34,742 --> 00:00:36,772
- You got a social media account?
- Yes.

10
00:00:36,872 --> 00:00:38,111
I'll do my best.

11
00:00:38,112 --> 00:00:39,212
You look like you'd be good at it.

12
00:00:39,712 --> 00:00:40,741
Thanks.

13
00:00:40,742 --> 00:00:42,181
If you see something...

14
00:00:42,182 --> 00:00:44,982
that'll probably go well among the opponent's campaign,

15
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:46,922
then mess with it, too.

16
00:00:47,682 --> 00:00:48,722
Mess with it?

17
00:00:49,122 --> 00:00:51,122
I don't think we should mess with them.

18
00:00:51,422 --> 00:00:52,422
Right?

19
00:00:52,622 --> 00:00:54,592
It may seem kind of cheap,

20
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:57,291
but that's not important as long as you win.

21
00:00:57,292 --> 00:00:58,332
I see.

22
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:00,032
Now, repeat after me.

23
00:01:00,502 --> 00:01:01,961
I am a spy.

24
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:03,432
Winning is all that matters.

25
00:01:03,632 --> 00:01:05,271
- I am a spy.
- I am a spy.

26
00:01:05,272 --> 00:01:07,142
- Winning is all that matters.
- Winning is all that matters.

27
00:01:07,202 --> 00:01:09,541
All of you are the faces of candidate one,

28
00:01:09,542 --> 00:01:11,272
so make sure you hold up a good image.

29
00:01:11,312 --> 00:01:12,371
Let's make this work, okay?

30
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:13,512
She's not talking nonsense.

31
00:01:13,542 --> 00:01:15,442
Hey, you punks. Don't be so sloppy.

32
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:16,952
I'll do my best.

33
00:01:20,182 --> 00:01:21,222
Get lost.

34
00:01:21,622 --> 00:01:23,352
You punk. Hey, get lost.

35
00:01:24,052 --> 00:01:25,122
I'll kill you.

36
00:01:26,762 --> 00:01:27,792
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:27,992 --> 00:01:29,962
(Music Room)

38
00:01:30,592 --> 00:01:33,531
- Yang Won Dae!
- Yang Won Dae!

39
00:01:33,532 --> 00:01:36,571
- Yang Won Dae!
- Yang Won Dae!

40
00:01:36,572 --> 00:01:39,371
- Yang Won Dae!
- Yang Won Dae!

41
00:01:39,372 --> 00:01:41,242
- Yang Won Dae!
- Yang Won Dae!

42
00:01:43,912 --> 00:01:46,512
Thanks for helping out with the upcoming election.

43
00:01:47,112 --> 00:01:49,482
Let's do our best and leave no regrets.

44
00:01:49,582 --> 00:01:51,111
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

45
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:52,552
- All right!
- Let's go!

46
00:01:53,052 --> 00:01:54,722
You should all share a word.

47
00:01:56,592 --> 00:01:59,522
There are many others who couldn't join our campaign.

48
00:01:59,622 --> 00:02:01,791
You all made it here despite the fierce competition,

49
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:03,692
so please do your best.

50
00:02:03,962 --> 00:02:05,732
- Let's do this!
- Looking pretty!

51
00:02:06,962 --> 00:02:08,032
Let's go!

52
00:02:10,302 --> 00:02:13,302
Once again, I thank you...

53
00:02:13,702 --> 00:02:15,642
for giving me this chance.

54
00:02:16,242 --> 00:02:18,941
I'll also do my best!

55
00:02:18,942 --> 00:02:20,481
- All right!
- Let's go!

56
00:02:20,482 --> 00:02:22,242
- Let's do it!
- You got this!

57
00:02:23,082 --> 00:02:25,452
This is yours. Jae Ik, size 105.

58
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,821
- Han Byeol, size 100.
- Yes!

59
00:02:27,822 --> 00:02:30,652
Gosh, even the material seems different.

60
00:02:30,892 --> 00:02:32,552
Of course, it's different...

61
00:02:32,622 --> 00:02:34,992
in the material, the way it fits, the finishing, and the details.

62
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,691
May I upload this as my outfit of the day?

63
00:02:36,692 --> 00:02:38,232
- Of course.
- Guys.

64
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,101
We have to wear this during the campaign,

65
00:02:40,102 --> 00:02:41,801
so don't leave it at home. Got it?

66
00:02:41,802 --> 00:02:42,901
- Yes!
- Yes!

67
00:02:42,902 --> 00:02:45,802
There are always those who end up leaving it at home.

68
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:47,802
And later,

69
00:02:47,942 --> 00:02:50,171
those who'll switch out the main poster...

70
00:02:50,172 --> 00:02:51,972
can tag along with Du Yeong.

71
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:53,942
All right, then.

72
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:56,682
The campaign begins tomorrow.

73
00:02:57,012 --> 00:03:00,282
Let's all have fun and enjoy this.

74
00:03:00,322 --> 00:03:02,682
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

75
00:03:03,822 --> 00:03:05,422
- Let's go!
- Additionally,

76
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,591
the leader of our camp is...

77
00:03:07,592 --> 00:03:10,232
Joo Wan Sik in the second year, although he looks much older.

78
00:03:10,492 --> 00:03:12,132
- Wan Sik.
- He'll teach us the fight song.

79
00:03:12,562 --> 00:03:13,802
I thought he was a teacher.

80
00:03:14,332 --> 00:03:16,062
Hey, I'm Joo Wan Sik.

81
00:03:16,502 --> 00:03:18,272
I made the fight song.

82
00:03:19,502 --> 00:03:20,542
Well...

83
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:27,212
Only one, only you

84
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:28,912
You

85
00:03:29,282 --> 00:03:31,981
The best choice for me

86
00:03:31,982 --> 00:03:34,421
Only one, only you

87
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,752
Candidate one, Kwak Sang Hyeon

88
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:39,591
- Okay?
- Okay!

89
00:03:39,592 --> 00:03:41,392
- Okay.
- This is our fight song.

90
00:03:41,792 --> 00:03:44,192
I'll send you a video in the group chat,

91
00:03:44,262 --> 00:03:46,332
so have it memorized. Okay?

92
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:47,732
- Okay.
- Yes.

93
00:03:47,902 --> 00:03:48,962
That includes you, Wan Sik.

94
00:03:50,602 --> 00:03:51,932
Fine. Okay.

95
00:03:52,072 --> 00:03:53,471
Now, let's do this, everyone!

96
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,702
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

97
00:03:56,272 --> 00:03:58,012
- We can do this!
- All right!

98
00:03:58,842 --> 00:04:00,242
- Let's do this!
- Let's go!

99
00:04:00,842 --> 00:04:03,052
And our cheering leader is Yu Ui Jun!

100
00:04:10,692 --> 00:04:13,522
I brought our slogan and the lyrics to our campaign song.

101
00:04:14,162 --> 00:04:16,021
Make sure you memorize these by tomorrow.

102
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,762
- Okay. What?
- What? Tomorrow?

103
00:04:17,932 --> 00:04:19,931
- By tomorrow?
- That's too fast.

104
00:04:19,932 --> 00:04:22,002
- I don't think I can do it.
- Tomorrow?

105
00:04:22,632 --> 00:04:23,672
I mean,

106
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,731
after all, we're the choir.

107
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,942
We can't do this half-heartedly. Right?

108
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:29,601
Do you want to lose against candidate one?

109
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,641
- No!
- No!

110
00:04:30,642 --> 00:04:32,812
Then, give me your trust, and let's do this!

111
00:04:34,212 --> 00:04:36,952
- Let's go! Come on!
- Yes!

112
00:04:37,052 --> 00:04:40,321
- Yang Won Dae!
- Yang Won Dae!

113
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:44,292
- Yang Won Dae!
- Yang Won Dae!

114
00:04:44,322 --> 00:04:47,322
(I Am A Running Mate)

115
00:04:48,392 --> 00:04:52,332
(Episode 4: The Start of the War)

116
00:04:52,432 --> 00:04:54,931
- Yang Won Dae!
- Yang Won Dae!

117
00:04:54,932 --> 00:04:56,501
That side is on fire, too.

118
00:04:56,502 --> 00:04:58,931
- Yang Won Dae!
- Yang Won Dae!

119
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:01,502
Hey, Jeong Hui. Do you want to grab a bite to eat?

120
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,972
- I got pocket money.
- No.

121
00:05:04,572 --> 00:05:06,842
Fine. I was just saying.

122
00:05:07,942 --> 00:05:10,112
I have to see my math tutor in 47 minutes.

123
00:05:10,552 --> 00:05:12,012
I see. Is that so?

124
00:05:12,982 --> 00:05:14,922
That's amazing. In 47 minutes?

125
00:05:16,752 --> 00:05:17,992
Let's grab a bite next time.

126
00:05:19,522 --> 00:05:20,561
Okay, then.

127
00:05:20,562 --> 00:05:22,522
- Yang Won Dae!
- Yang Won Dae!

128
00:05:30,732 --> 00:05:33,172
Hey, right. You know what?

129
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,342
How much do you pay to get the math lessons?

130
00:05:42,682 --> 00:05:46,052
This stop is Jinil Arts High School.

131
00:05:46,752 --> 00:05:49,822
Next stop is Hangang Bridge Intersection.

132
00:05:54,462 --> 00:05:56,122
- Hurry up.
- Do you have the card?

133
00:05:56,762 --> 00:05:58,162
- See you tomorrow.
- What?

134
00:06:00,432 --> 00:06:02,732
- Did you really say that?
- Cut it out.

135
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,372
- What?
- Did you lose?

136
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:07,102
- Seriously?
- Yes, of course.

137
00:06:07,172 --> 00:06:08,242
What...

138
00:06:09,142 --> 00:06:10,142
Hey.

139
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,012
Mi Na.

140
00:06:14,182 --> 00:06:15,212
Hey.

141
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:18,182
(Number 1 in grade improvement. Repeater program available now.)

142
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:19,652
Did you just get off school?

143
00:06:20,052 --> 00:06:21,022
Yes.

144
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:22,952
Did you get home safely that day?

145
00:06:24,292 --> 00:06:25,292
Yes.

146
00:06:25,293 --> 00:06:27,762
You talked as if you were going to call me often,

147
00:06:27,892 --> 00:06:29,062
but you never called once.

148
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:30,832
What?

149
00:06:32,332 --> 00:06:33,532
Do you even remember?

150
00:06:45,212 --> 00:06:47,582
Did you really say that?

151
00:06:47,912 --> 00:06:49,182
Yes.

152
00:06:49,912 --> 00:06:51,352
Hey, Mi Na.

153
00:06:51,882 --> 00:06:52,882
Yes?

154
00:06:53,282 --> 00:06:55,182
What happened that night...

155
00:06:56,992 --> 00:06:58,652
at Sang Hyeon's birthday party...

156
00:06:58,952 --> 00:06:59,962
Yes?

157
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:04,132
It was my first time doing that,

158
00:07:05,632 --> 00:07:07,602
although I don't really remember it.

159
00:07:09,932 --> 00:07:11,132
Back then,

160
00:07:13,842 --> 00:07:15,372
nothing happened between us.

161
00:07:16,242 --> 00:07:18,512
- What?
- Nothing happened.

162
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,442
We got wasted, so we both fell right asleep.

163
00:07:21,712 --> 00:07:22,742
Right.

164
00:07:23,412 --> 00:07:25,352
But we were both undressed...

165
00:07:26,652 --> 00:07:28,022
You really don't remember?

166
00:07:28,422 --> 00:07:31,422
I got completely wet trying to wash you.

167
00:07:33,862 --> 00:07:35,862
- I can't believe this.
- I see.

168
00:07:39,232 --> 00:07:40,262
I'm sorry.

169
00:07:40,732 --> 00:07:42,702
I thought we did something.

170
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,702
What's going on?

171
00:07:49,272 --> 00:07:51,042
What is it?

172
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:55,942
Did you say the campaign begins tomorrow?

173
00:07:57,582 --> 00:07:58,582
Yes.

174
00:08:13,232 --> 00:08:14,232
Good luck.

175
00:08:15,002 --> 00:08:17,872
If he wins the election, I'll let you do it with me.

176
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:21,072
Okay.

177
00:08:38,092 --> 00:08:41,122
That was the first indirect kiss of my life!

178
00:08:55,372 --> 00:08:57,042
(Noh Se Hoon)

179
00:09:01,112 --> 00:09:02,182
How pretty.

180
00:09:03,112 --> 00:09:04,182
What?

181
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,322
So cute.

182
00:09:08,822 --> 00:09:10,992
Hey, this is from that time.

183
00:09:13,022 --> 00:09:14,162
There's the hot guy.

184
00:09:23,902 --> 00:09:26,402
(Youngjin High School in Harmony)

185
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:32,442
(Kwak Sang Hyeon, Yoon Jeong Hui, Noh Se Hoon)

186
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,411
(Yang Won Dae, Ha Yu Gyeong, Park Ji Hun)

187
00:09:34,412 --> 00:09:35,412
(Study and play here at Youngjin High School.)

188
00:09:35,582 --> 00:09:37,751
(Only one, only you)

189
00:09:37,752 --> 00:09:40,252
(Study and play here at Youngjin High School.)

190
00:09:40,482 --> 00:09:43,792
(The first rally)

191
00:09:44,392 --> 00:09:45,521
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

192
00:09:45,522 --> 00:09:46,722
Hey.

193
00:09:47,522 --> 00:09:48,691
Hurry up and do it.

194
00:09:48,692 --> 00:09:50,392
- Do it.
- I have to get that.

195
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:53,192
Let's think about it. Okay?

196
00:09:54,602 --> 00:09:55,632
Push it up.

197
00:09:57,372 --> 00:09:58,971
Keep your eyes on everything...

198
00:09:58,972 --> 00:10:01,541
and see what's where and what may cause a problem.

199
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:03,742
You have to check and see if these flyers are all stamped.

200
00:10:04,012 --> 00:10:05,072
Good. Take more photos.

201
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,712
No, it keeps getting crooked because you're looking at it.

202
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:09,882
- Let's do this.
- We got this.

203
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:17,622
All right, now. Today is the first day of your rally.

204
00:10:17,692 --> 00:10:19,821
Let's not get into a fight, and do our best as we prepared.

205
00:10:19,822 --> 00:10:21,121
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

206
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:23,862
And don't let me catch you bribing the voters...

207
00:10:24,032 --> 00:10:26,162
with gift vouchers or merch, because you'll have to drop out.

208
00:10:26,232 --> 00:10:27,232
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

209
00:10:27,262 --> 00:10:30,072
All right. Let's do and behave as we learned.

210
00:10:30,532 --> 00:10:32,671
If you have any questions, you can come directly to me.

211
00:10:32,672 --> 00:10:33,771
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

212
00:10:33,772 --> 00:10:36,041
Student council, let's check and look for potential problems.

213
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:37,611
- Yes, sir.
- All right, now.

214
00:10:37,612 --> 00:10:38,911
Let's all do this!

215
00:10:38,912 --> 00:10:40,241
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

216
00:10:40,242 --> 00:10:42,211
- To your positions!
- To positions!

217
00:10:42,212 --> 00:10:43,681
- Let's go!
- Let's move it!

218
00:10:43,682 --> 00:10:44,851
- One, two, three!
- Let's start with this.

219
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,481
- Yes!
- Yes!

220
00:10:46,482 --> 00:10:48,982
- Yes!
- All right!

221
00:10:49,722 --> 00:10:51,592
Hey, we need this.

222
00:10:52,322 --> 00:10:53,891
We haven't put the sticker on it.

223
00:10:53,892 --> 00:10:55,791
- Hey, camp two.
- Yes? Why?

224
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:57,031
I haven't seen this before.

225
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:58,161
Where's the sticker?

226
00:10:58,162 --> 00:10:59,862
Right. The sticker.

227
00:11:00,232 --> 00:11:01,962
- It must've fallen off.
- Hey, Jeong Ah.

228
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:03,971
- Yes?
- Get this on camera.

229
00:11:03,972 --> 00:11:05,132
- There's no sticker on it.
- Right.

230
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:06,972
Yes. Okay.

231
00:11:07,072 --> 00:11:08,642
- Are these 400 in total?
- Yes.

232
00:11:08,842 --> 00:11:10,641
- Did you count it? 400?
- Hello.

233
00:11:10,642 --> 00:11:12,041
Hey, there. Hello.

234
00:11:12,042 --> 00:11:14,242
You can't give out such expensive chocolate here.

235
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:15,282
These are mine.

236
00:11:15,412 --> 00:11:17,082
You're going to eat all these yourself?

237
00:11:17,312 --> 00:11:19,252
Come on. Don't be so uptight.

238
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,921
It's a prejudice to think he won't be able to eat...

239
00:11:20,922 --> 00:11:23,181
- all these by himself.
- I'll have to take these away.

240
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,751
- Come on.
- You can keep one.

241
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:26,821
- Come on.
- Just keep that.

242
00:11:26,822 --> 00:11:28,792
- It's okay.
- You can't give these out.

243
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:30,761
- Hey, give him the chocolate.
- Keep it.

244
00:11:30,762 --> 00:11:32,291
- Yes.
- You ate it.

245
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,502
- No.
- You ate it.

246
00:11:33,602 --> 00:11:36,032
Are they allowed to spray perfume on their flyers?

247
00:11:37,532 --> 00:11:39,602
Well, there are no rules against it.

248
00:11:40,502 --> 00:11:41,502
It's okay.

249
00:11:42,442 --> 00:11:43,711
What do you think, Jeong Ah?

250
00:11:43,712 --> 00:11:44,872
What?

251
00:11:46,342 --> 00:11:47,342
It smells good.

252
00:11:47,343 --> 00:11:48,641
- Stop coming over.
- What?

253
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:50,651
- No, you.
- Now, settle down, kids.

254
00:11:50,652 --> 00:11:52,582
It's okay. Settle down. Yes.

255
00:11:53,752 --> 00:11:55,922
- This is our turf.
- Go away.

256
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:58,521
Anyway, I don't see Se Hoon around here.

257
00:11:58,522 --> 00:11:59,552
Is he not here yet?

258
00:11:59,722 --> 00:12:01,392
Well, it's...

259
00:12:02,762 --> 00:12:03,792
Is he not here yet?

260
00:12:04,232 --> 00:12:05,262
Is he not here yet?

261
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:07,802
Right.

262
00:12:10,332 --> 00:12:13,542
This stop is Youngjin High School Back Gate.

263
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:22,112
When did you get here? When?

264
00:12:22,412 --> 00:12:24,412
- What?
- I mean you.

265
00:12:24,612 --> 00:12:26,851
- Stop acting mysterious.
- What?

266
00:12:26,852 --> 00:12:28,552
- Let's go.
- We have to get to school.

267
00:12:28,722 --> 00:12:30,392
- We'll run late.
- We're fine.

268
00:12:34,492 --> 00:12:36,322
Where are you, Se Hoon?

269
00:12:36,362 --> 00:12:37,532
Hey, Jeong Hui.

270
00:12:37,762 --> 00:12:39,362
I'm almost there. Give me just a moment.

271
00:12:41,832 --> 00:12:42,832
My outfit.

272
00:12:44,232 --> 00:12:45,632
Yes, right!

273
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,472
This stop is National Cemetery.

274
00:12:52,612 --> 00:12:55,382
- I'm not doing that.
- It goes like this.

275
00:12:55,712 --> 00:12:57,512
- Like this?
- Exactly.

276
00:12:57,982 --> 00:12:59,881
- Let's recap.
- Hey.

277
00:12:59,882 --> 00:13:02,222
I think it went like this.

278
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,021
(Only one, only you, Kwak Sang Hyeon)

279
00:13:05,022 --> 00:13:06,852
(Let's turn our prestigious school into a luxurious one, too.)

280
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,392
(Vote for our friend, candidate 1, Kwak Sang Hyeon)

281
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:11,192
Se Hoon, look at everyone else.

282
00:13:11,732 --> 00:13:13,561
Why didn't you just come in your school uniform?

283
00:13:13,562 --> 00:13:14,661
Are you here to look like a homeless guy?

284
00:13:14,662 --> 00:13:16,161
Are you trying to make people pity you?

285
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,971
And wipe that off. It's smelly.

286
00:13:17,972 --> 00:13:19,872
I tried my best to look as similar as I could.

287
00:13:20,002 --> 00:13:21,942
Hey, man.

288
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:23,912
Where did you get this outfit?

289
00:13:24,642 --> 00:13:27,142
I just picked up whatever I could in the locker room on the first floor.

290
00:13:27,282 --> 00:13:30,011
Hey, those gym clothes had been there since we started school.

291
00:13:30,012 --> 00:13:31,282
Wipe it off as much as you can.

292
00:13:31,552 --> 00:13:33,381
Hey, the perfumed flyers won't do the trick.

293
00:13:33,382 --> 00:13:34,981
If you pick up random clothes and put them on,

294
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:36,222
your private parts will deteriorate.

295
00:13:36,452 --> 00:13:37,452
Shut your mouth.

296
00:13:37,453 --> 00:13:40,622
Hey, wait. I think this is really poop.

297
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,362
Goodness.

298
00:13:43,392 --> 00:13:44,492
Darn it.

299
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:47,132
Hey, wipe off the back first, you idiot.

300
00:13:47,732 --> 00:13:49,162
What an idiot.

301
00:13:49,432 --> 00:13:50,732
Just resign.

302
00:13:50,932 --> 00:13:52,831
Yes, just resign, you idiot. Okay?

303
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,241
That's enough. Get back.

304
00:13:54,242 --> 00:13:55,502
Is that really poop?

305
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:58,012
Just practice your dance.

306
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:02,982
Is it?

307
00:14:04,952 --> 00:14:07,122
- I think so.
- It smells.

308
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:11,522
- That's totally a poop stain.
- Darn it.

309
00:14:11,622 --> 00:14:13,552
Look at that.

310
00:14:14,192 --> 00:14:15,391
See?

311
00:14:15,392 --> 00:14:17,032
I'm telling you.

312
00:14:17,262 --> 00:14:18,732
This is driving me crazy.

313
00:14:18,962 --> 00:14:20,832
Yes, I can tell.

314
00:14:21,232 --> 00:14:22,662
I just want to die.

315
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,201
Yes, that'll probably be better.

316
00:14:25,202 --> 00:14:27,471
- Look at him.
- Is that right?

317
00:14:27,472 --> 00:14:29,742
Get ready to charge, camp one!

318
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:32,711
I'm candidate number one, Kwak Sang Hyeon.

319
00:14:32,712 --> 00:14:35,412
- Vote for him.
- The leader of Youngjin High!

320
00:14:35,582 --> 00:14:38,951
- Hold on tight to Kwak Sang Hyeon!
- Hold on tight to Kwak Sang Hyeon!

321
00:14:38,952 --> 00:14:41,021
The walking luxury boutique!

322
00:14:41,022 --> 00:14:44,391
- Hold on tight to Kwak Sang Hyeon!
- Hold on tight to Kwak Sang Hyeon!

323
00:14:44,392 --> 00:14:46,091
Let's make him the student president!

324
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:47,991
- Try to do better.
- Hold on tight...

325
00:14:47,992 --> 00:14:49,861
- to Kwak Sang Hyeon!
- To Kwak Sang Hyeon!

326
00:14:49,862 --> 00:14:50,892
Hello.

327
00:14:51,162 --> 00:14:53,292
I'm with candidate one. Please take a look.

328
00:14:53,532 --> 00:14:55,562
Why are you giving me this?

329
00:14:55,632 --> 00:14:57,802
Have a piece of chocolate. Please enjoy it.

330
00:14:57,832 --> 00:14:59,701
- Why are you doing this?
- Get back inside.

331
00:14:59,702 --> 00:15:01,502
- Hey, it's okay.
- We're sorry.

332
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:10,612
And now, it's time to hear from our candidate, Yang Won Dae.

333
00:15:10,682 --> 00:15:11,881
Give him a big hand!

334
00:15:11,882 --> 00:15:13,852
(Yang Won Dae)

335
00:15:13,952 --> 00:15:15,552
(Kwak Sang Hyeon)

336
00:15:16,752 --> 00:15:18,721
Camp two!

337
00:15:18,722 --> 00:15:20,022
- Yes!
- Yes!

338
00:15:20,492 --> 00:15:22,992
Let's change this school!

339
00:15:23,092 --> 00:15:25,731
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

340
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:27,102
Won Dae!

341
00:15:27,532 --> 00:15:29,731
Can we really go...

342
00:15:29,732 --> 00:15:32,172
- on a school trip?
- Can we?

343
00:15:32,272 --> 00:15:34,702
Once again, let us...

344
00:15:35,342 --> 00:15:37,672
go on a school trip!

345
00:15:37,712 --> 00:15:39,741
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

346
00:15:39,742 --> 00:15:40,781
Y for Yang!

347
00:15:40,782 --> 00:15:43,752
Your charms are endless, just like an onion!

348
00:15:44,112 --> 00:15:46,981
- W for Won!
- Work for your huge dream!

349
00:15:46,982 --> 00:15:49,651
- D for Dae!
- Dear love of Youngjin High,

350
00:15:49,652 --> 00:15:51,322
it's all for...

351
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,151
- Won Dae!
- Won Dae!

352
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:55,862
For the greatness of Youngjin!

353
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:58,392
- For greatness!
- For greatness!

354
00:16:01,132 --> 00:16:03,971
- Yang Won Dae!
- Yang Won Dae!

355
00:16:03,972 --> 00:16:06,931
- Yang Won Dae!
- Yang Won Dae!

356
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:08,671
- Yang Won Dae!
- Kwak Sang Hyeon!

357
00:16:08,672 --> 00:16:11,512
- Yang Won Dae!
- Kwak Sang Hyeon!

358
00:16:12,412 --> 00:16:13,442
Stop crossing over.

359
00:16:15,212 --> 00:16:16,582
Hey, this is on fire.

360
00:16:17,712 --> 00:16:19,651
Read this, and let me know if you need anything else.

361
00:16:19,652 --> 00:16:21,422
I'll make sure I provide it with the best quality.

362
00:16:21,482 --> 00:16:23,681
- Sang Hyeon!
- Sang Hyeon, you're so hot!

363
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:26,022
- Please vote for candidate one.
- You're so cute!

364
00:16:26,422 --> 00:16:28,491
Sang Hyeon, I'll make sure the kids in my class vote for you.

365
00:16:28,492 --> 00:16:30,321
- Sang Hyeon!
- Right. Thanks.

366
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,332
Please take a look at our pledges.

367
00:16:33,462 --> 00:16:35,831
Don't you all watch lots of Qtube and online lessons?

368
00:16:35,832 --> 00:16:39,271
These days, you can charge your tablets and phones at your desk.

369
00:16:39,272 --> 00:16:40,971
- Whoa, really?
- How many can we plug in?

370
00:16:40,972 --> 00:16:42,301
How about wireless charging?

371
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:43,372
What about iPhones?

372
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,171
I'll look into it.

373
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,241
It works with iPhones,

374
00:16:46,242 --> 00:16:48,782
but I'll have to check if wireless charging is available.

375
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:50,142
Do you have any other questions?

376
00:16:50,212 --> 00:16:51,581
Can we watch special lectures online?

377
00:16:51,582 --> 00:16:53,311
Hey, Jun Seok. Vote for candidate one.

378
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,321
Who will you vote for? One?

379
00:16:54,322 --> 00:16:56,122
What the heck is this? You look ridiculous.

380
00:16:57,822 --> 00:16:58,921
Hey, darn it.

381
00:16:58,922 --> 00:17:00,892
You can't look like this and want to be the vice president.

382
00:17:01,192 --> 00:17:03,562
Don't be so frustrating. You need to show more spirit.

383
00:17:03,832 --> 00:17:05,431
Hey, there, friend. Who will you vote for?

384
00:17:05,432 --> 00:17:06,561
- Vote for one.
- Vote for one.

385
00:17:06,562 --> 00:17:08,201
So, he'll open up a special lecture?

386
00:17:08,202 --> 00:17:10,332
Sure, I'll check on it.

387
00:17:10,902 --> 00:17:14,042
I'll make sure we can open up a special lecture just for us.

388
00:17:14,072 --> 00:17:15,872
- I'll check.
- I decided...

389
00:17:16,572 --> 00:17:19,542
to use one of our key pledges...

390
00:17:19,742 --> 00:17:22,782
and changed the lyrics to one of Yoon Jong Shin's songs.

391
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:24,652
As you already know,

392
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:27,652
one of the huge impacts the pandemic left us with was...

393
00:17:28,252 --> 00:17:31,122
the abolishment of school trips for 1st and 2nd years,

394
00:17:31,322 --> 00:17:34,322
as well as the graduation trip for the third years.

395
00:17:34,862 --> 00:17:36,321
They can't do that.

396
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:38,092
- Excuse me.
- On top of that, the school...

397
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:40,192
wishes to prevent...

398
00:17:40,562 --> 00:17:42,532
all school trips from happening...

399
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:44,572
with the excuse that we should focus on studying.

400
00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:48,372
This is just deplorable.

401
00:17:49,472 --> 00:17:51,212
And now, I dare say this before you.

402
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:53,942
Getting into universities is important.

403
00:17:54,242 --> 00:17:56,142
But what about the memories we never got to make?

404
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:59,351
We must be compensated for the memories we lost!

405
00:17:59,352 --> 00:18:02,081
- You're right!
- Yes!

406
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,422
And who'll give us that compensation?

407
00:18:04,592 --> 00:18:06,251
- Yang Won Dae!
- Yes!

408
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,691
- Yang Won Dae!
- That's it!

409
00:18:07,692 --> 00:18:10,221
- Vote number two, Yang Won Dae!
- Vote number two, Yang Won Dae!

410
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:11,461
That's right.

411
00:18:11,462 --> 00:18:13,132
That's why I want to sing this song.

412
00:18:13,462 --> 00:18:15,002
"Intuitively."

413
00:18:16,132 --> 00:18:18,072
- All right!
- Go!

414
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:20,101
You can do this!

415
00:18:20,102 --> 00:18:21,272
(Let the small changes make the school big!)

416
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:24,871
I knew intuitively

417
00:18:24,872 --> 00:18:27,311
That I'd get to go on a school trip

418
00:18:27,312 --> 00:18:29,681
Won Dae's pledge, school trip

419
00:18:29,682 --> 00:18:32,052
I couldn't forget the thrill

420
00:18:37,022 --> 00:18:39,221
- From camp two, Ji Hun!
- From camp two, Ji Hun!

421
00:18:39,222 --> 00:18:41,522
- You're on fire, Ji Hun!
- You're on fire, Ji Hun!

422
00:18:41,562 --> 00:18:43,891
- You wouldn't know before you voted - Don't look at that.

423
00:18:43,892 --> 00:18:46,291
But you'll see when you pick him

424
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,631
After your tough senior year

425
00:18:48,632 --> 00:18:51,102
- The graduation photo will prove it - What are you doing?

426
00:18:55,942 --> 00:18:58,111
- From camp two, Ji Hun!
- From camp two, Ji Hun!

427
00:18:58,112 --> 00:19:00,041
- You're on fire, Ji Hun!
- You're on fire, Ji Hun!

428
00:19:00,042 --> 00:19:06,981
I'll believe in candidate two

429
00:19:06,982 --> 00:19:09,281
Whom I voted for

430
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:13,291
The one whom I chose

431
00:19:13,292 --> 00:19:17,462
Won Dae

432
00:19:19,362 --> 00:19:21,801
Will it be the trip of my life?

433
00:19:21,802 --> 00:19:24,131
Or will this trip get cancelled, too?

434
00:19:24,132 --> 00:19:26,531
Pick him and wait for the pledge

435
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,942
So, I'll vote for him intuitively

436
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:36,041
- From camp two, Ji Hun!
- From camp two, Ji Hun!

437
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:37,711
- We love you, Ji Hun!
- We love you, Ji Hun!

438
00:19:37,712 --> 00:19:38,752
One more time!

439
00:19:39,652 --> 00:19:41,751
(Yang Won Dae)

440
00:19:41,752 --> 00:19:43,552
(Kwak Sang Hyeon)

441
00:19:43,652 --> 00:19:46,792
(Let the small changes make the school big!)

442
00:19:47,822 --> 00:19:49,262
That's it!

443
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:50,631
- Great job!
- All right!

444
00:19:50,632 --> 00:19:52,832
- Thank you!
- We love you!

445
00:19:52,862 --> 00:19:55,261
- Vote number two!
- Vote number two!

446
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:57,631
- Vote number two!
- Vote number two!

447
00:19:57,632 --> 00:19:59,872
- Vote number two!
- Vote number two!

448
00:19:59,972 --> 00:20:02,041
- Vote number two!
- Vote number two!

449
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:04,842
- Vote number two!
- Won Dae! Yang Won Dae!

450
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:08,712
Se Hoon, what are you wearing?

451
00:20:08,912 --> 00:20:10,012
And you were late?

452
00:20:10,582 --> 00:20:12,652
- Follow us.
- You're dead.

453
00:20:12,952 --> 00:20:15,321
- Vote number two!
- Vote number two!

454
00:20:15,322 --> 00:20:17,392
- Vote number two!
- Vote number two!

455
00:20:17,452 --> 00:20:20,451
- Kwak Sang Hyeon!
- Vote number two!

456
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:23,591
- Vote number two!
- Kwak Sang Hyeon!

457
00:20:23,592 --> 00:20:27,032
- Yang Won Dae!
- Kwak Sang Hyeon!

458
00:20:27,232 --> 00:20:28,662
You came prepared.

459
00:20:28,702 --> 00:20:30,631
- Yang Won Dae!
- Kwak Sang Hyeon!

460
00:20:30,632 --> 00:20:33,232
- Yang Won Dae!
- Kwak Sang Hyeon!

461
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:36,042
Well, you didn't do so badly.

462
00:20:36,872 --> 00:20:39,712
- Yang Won Dae!
- Kwak Sang Hyeon!

463
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:44,012
- Yang Won Dae!
- Kwak Sang Hyeon!

464
00:20:44,152 --> 00:20:46,912
- Vote number two!
- Kwak Sang Hyeon!

465
00:20:47,082 --> 00:20:50,081
- Yang Won Dae!
- Kwak Sang Hyeon!

466
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,122
- Yang Won Dae!
- Kwak Sang Hyeon!

467
00:20:53,622 --> 00:20:55,261
(Reporter Ko Young Chan)

468
00:20:55,262 --> 00:20:56,461
Hello.

469
00:20:56,462 --> 00:20:58,592
You're here with Ko Young Chan of YJBS.

470
00:20:58,762 --> 00:21:01,701
The 75th Youngjin High School Student President Election is...

471
00:21:01,702 --> 00:21:03,662
just six days away.

472
00:21:04,272 --> 00:21:06,301
Candidate one is Kwak Sang Hyeon,

473
00:21:06,302 --> 00:21:07,771
a new candidate who emerged...

474
00:21:07,772 --> 00:21:09,772
with his slogan, "Only one, only you."

475
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:11,671
He's up against candidate two, Yang Won Dae,

476
00:21:11,672 --> 00:21:12,841
who's up for re-election...

477
00:21:12,842 --> 00:21:14,612
with his slogan, "Reboot."

478
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:15,981
(Candidates begin their rally before the election.)

479
00:21:15,982 --> 00:21:17,341
This morning, both candidates began...

480
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:20,182
their campaign at the front gate as students came to school.

481
00:21:20,652 --> 00:21:21,652
Both camps...

482
00:21:21,653 --> 00:21:23,681
made their case to the voters...

483
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,692
with the campaign materials and slogans.

484
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:28,521
Candidate number one came with their sleek team uniform...

485
00:21:28,522 --> 00:21:29,592
and perfumed flyers.

486
00:21:29,862 --> 00:21:31,961
Candidate number two showed their unity and energy,

487
00:21:31,962 --> 00:21:34,361
as most of the camp...

488
00:21:34,362 --> 00:21:35,832
consisted of the choir.

489
00:21:36,432 --> 00:21:39,301
Park Ji Hun's live performance...

490
00:21:39,302 --> 00:21:41,141
centering around the pledge to revive school trips...

491
00:21:41,142 --> 00:21:43,842
left the voters with a strong impression.

492
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:46,772
Let's take a look at the current support ratings.

493
00:21:47,042 --> 00:21:48,441
(Support Ratings)

494
00:21:48,442 --> 00:21:49,882
(Kwak Sang Hyeon: 35 percent, Yang Won Dae: 65 percent)

495
00:21:49,912 --> 00:21:51,411
We'll continue to share...

496
00:21:51,412 --> 00:21:52,581
the support ratings...

497
00:21:52,582 --> 00:21:54,822
as polled by the statistics club.

498
00:21:55,252 --> 00:21:57,622
Join us here on YJBS as you keep your eyes on...

499
00:21:57,892 --> 00:22:00,122
the dynamic changes in the support ratings.

500
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,632
Now, you saw everything today.

501
00:22:06,062 --> 00:22:07,192
The other candidate isn't much.

502
00:22:07,462 --> 00:22:09,102
They may look flashy,

503
00:22:09,632 --> 00:22:11,032
but there's no heart in it.

504
00:22:11,402 --> 00:22:12,671
You saw how other students responded.

505
00:22:12,672 --> 00:22:14,771
The pledge to revive school trips is much more effective...

506
00:22:14,772 --> 00:22:16,141
compared to their pledges...

507
00:22:16,142 --> 00:22:17,241
to abolish uniforms and get new desks.

508
00:22:17,242 --> 00:22:18,312
Yes!

509
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:19,742
And this thing?

510
00:22:20,412 --> 00:22:22,212
It's nothing but trash once the smell wears off.

511
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:25,782
Sincerity and practicality.

512
00:22:26,452 --> 00:22:27,822
That's our weapon.

513
00:22:30,422 --> 00:22:32,091
Also, they don't know how to do this.

514
00:22:32,092 --> 00:22:33,922
- They haven't done anything.
- That's right.

515
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:35,221
I've kept my eyes...

516
00:22:35,222 --> 00:22:37,291
on the core of the problems of this school...

517
00:22:37,292 --> 00:22:38,692
for the last year.

518
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:40,902
Just keep your trust in me.

519
00:22:41,202 --> 00:22:43,302
I know I'll win. Okay?

520
00:22:43,402 --> 00:22:45,132
- Yes!
- Yes!

521
00:22:46,672 --> 00:22:47,702
All right!

522
00:22:48,442 --> 00:22:50,201
The virtue of Youngjin!

523
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,811
- Yang Won Dae!
- Yang Won Dae!

524
00:22:51,812 --> 00:22:53,371
- Of course, it's number two.
- Of course, it's number two.

525
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,911
- Always vote number two.
- Always vote number two.

526
00:22:54,912 --> 00:22:56,412
- Vote number two unconditionally!
- Vote number two unconditionally!

527
00:22:58,352 --> 00:22:59,411
- Yes!
- All right!

528
00:22:59,412 --> 00:23:00,482
Great job!

529
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:04,292
Vote for number two!

530
00:23:06,422 --> 00:23:08,862
This is war.

531
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:10,991
It's war.

532
00:23:10,992 --> 00:23:12,892
For what? To seize power.

533
00:23:13,032 --> 00:23:14,702
It's to get that power.

534
00:23:14,862 --> 00:23:16,761
Revising the school rules? Changing the environment?

535
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:17,932
The school trip?

536
00:23:18,202 --> 00:23:21,702
In the end, the one who has power gets to decide everything.

537
00:23:22,172 --> 00:23:23,242
What power?

538
00:23:25,042 --> 00:23:26,942
Hey, you may think this is funny.

539
00:23:27,312 --> 00:23:30,042
You're wondering why power is involved in this kids' election.

540
00:23:30,582 --> 00:23:31,612
Then, win to find out.

541
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:32,982
You'll see once you win.

542
00:23:33,252 --> 00:23:35,851
The things you imagined alone in your head...

543
00:23:35,852 --> 00:23:39,322
will become a reality before your eyes.

544
00:23:39,722 --> 00:23:41,662
So, what should we do to make that happen?

545
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:46,831
Think that you will make sure the candidate you're with...

546
00:23:46,832 --> 00:23:49,002
becomes the student president.

547
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:52,001
That's the kind of spirit we need in this war. You know what I'm saying?

548
00:23:52,002 --> 00:23:53,302
- Yes!
- Yes!

549
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,872
Don't be depressed that our first day didn't go so well.

550
00:23:55,972 --> 00:23:58,541
I'm going to fill your head with the winner's mentality.

551
00:23:58,542 --> 00:24:00,771
So, stop looking like losers...

552
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,912
and make a face like you already won. Got it?

553
00:24:02,982 --> 00:24:04,142
- Yes!
- Yes!

554
00:24:05,682 --> 00:24:06,982
Eat up.

555
00:24:10,822 --> 00:24:12,621
(What do I dream of today?)

556
00:24:12,622 --> 00:24:14,392
(Kwak Sang Hyeon, Yang Won Dae)

557
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,332
- That's mine.
- Sure.

558
00:24:25,472 --> 00:24:26,672
What is he doing?

559
00:24:27,402 --> 00:24:28,442
What's that?

560
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:31,512
(Kwak Sang Hyeon, Yang Won Dae)

561
00:24:32,442 --> 00:24:34,341
Did you figure out the support ratings for each class?

562
00:24:34,342 --> 00:24:36,011
I'm still figuring out the third year.

563
00:24:36,012 --> 00:24:37,012
This is for the second year.

564
00:24:37,282 --> 00:24:38,952
- And the first year.
- Thank you.

565
00:24:39,582 --> 00:24:41,051
The key in every war is...

566
00:24:41,052 --> 00:24:43,682
how you plan out the strategies and tactics.

567
00:24:43,922 --> 00:24:46,121
Strategies are what we need to win the actual war,

568
00:24:46,122 --> 00:24:47,962
the overall big picture.

569
00:24:48,262 --> 00:24:51,061
Tactics are like tricks we need to pull...

570
00:24:51,062 --> 00:24:52,362
in different kinds of battles.

571
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:53,832
Now.

572
00:24:54,162 --> 00:24:56,031
I have a report of classes...

573
00:24:56,032 --> 00:24:57,931
that shows the lowest and highest support ratings.

574
00:24:57,932 --> 00:24:58,932
With that being said,

575
00:24:59,402 --> 00:25:01,472
where should we go first?

576
00:25:01,942 --> 00:25:02,942
In Gyeong!

577
00:25:03,672 --> 00:25:05,042
The class with the lowest support rating.

578
00:25:05,612 --> 00:25:06,642
No.

579
00:25:07,242 --> 00:25:08,812
Actually, we must think the opposite.

580
00:25:09,212 --> 00:25:11,612
We must make sure to secure the ones...

581
00:25:12,082 --> 00:25:13,211
who support us.

582
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:16,052
In other words, we must first create...

583
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,092
a group of fervent supporters. And here's why.

584
00:25:18,722 --> 00:25:20,422
Even if the numbers are the same,

585
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:22,962
they will voice their support more strongly.

586
00:25:23,192 --> 00:25:26,792
That's why we must use our breaks to campaign for our candidate.

587
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:28,732
We'll visit the classes where we have support.

588
00:25:29,132 --> 00:25:30,302
When you go to them...

589
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,302
"Whom will you vote for?"

590
00:25:32,502 --> 00:25:33,832
"Could you vote for us?"

591
00:25:34,302 --> 00:25:35,472
That's not the right way to campaign.

592
00:25:38,512 --> 00:25:40,372
"I know you'll vote for us."

593
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:42,442
"Please talk to other students for us."

594
00:25:43,482 --> 00:25:44,682
- Sure.
- Okay.

595
00:25:45,182 --> 00:25:46,582
That's the vibe we're looking for.

596
00:25:47,482 --> 00:25:48,482
Do you get it?

597
00:25:48,483 --> 00:25:49,921
"Hey, if you have a brain,"

598
00:25:49,922 --> 00:25:53,091
"you ought to vote for number one. That's what everyone should do."

599
00:25:53,092 --> 00:25:55,321
"Are you really going to vote for that jerk, Yang Won Dae?"

600
00:25:55,322 --> 00:25:57,162
"He's just running again, so he can get into college easily."

601
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,391
"Will you let that jerk's greed win this election?"

602
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:01,062
"Are you crazy?"

603
00:26:01,202 --> 00:26:02,862
- No.
- No.

604
00:26:03,802 --> 00:26:04,972
We shouldn't be the ones...

605
00:26:05,902 --> 00:26:07,572
saying all this.

606
00:26:08,042 --> 00:26:10,772
We have to get our supporters to say all this.

607
00:26:11,512 --> 00:26:12,542
All we need to do...

608
00:26:12,772 --> 00:26:15,642
is light a fire on the wolf's tail.

609
00:26:16,182 --> 00:26:17,242
So...

610
00:26:17,582 --> 00:26:18,612
Let's go.

611
00:26:18,882 --> 00:26:20,412
Go and bring all of them to me.

612
00:26:20,582 --> 00:26:23,682
Not to the Walking Convenience Store or whatever people call him.

613
00:26:24,122 --> 00:26:25,852
Bring all of them to me...

614
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:28,962
even if you have to beat them up! Understood?

615
00:26:29,062 --> 00:26:30,462
- Yes!
- Yes!

616
00:26:30,492 --> 00:26:33,462
Go to your places and make a move. Got it?

617
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,302
Let's crush them all. Darn it.

618
00:26:35,332 --> 00:26:36,862
Let's set this thing on fire.

619
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,601
- Yes!
- Yes!

620
00:26:38,602 --> 00:26:40,502
- Let's go!
- Yes!

621
00:26:40,672 --> 00:26:41,672
Let's go.

622
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,642
- Let's go.
- Come on.

623
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:44,911
- Let's go.
- Go!

624
00:26:44,912 --> 00:26:46,571
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

625
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:48,181
- Let's go and do this.
- Let's go.

626
00:26:48,182 --> 00:26:49,482
Hey, go!

627
00:26:49,882 --> 00:26:50,882
Se Hoon.

628
00:26:51,012 --> 00:26:52,012
Just a second.

629
00:26:52,552 --> 00:26:53,582
Yes?

630
00:26:53,782 --> 00:26:55,682
You and I need to have a little chat.

631
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:57,992
What?

632
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:04,932
(Candidate 1 Noh Se Hoon's Hard Day)

633
00:27:04,962 --> 00:27:06,392
Gosh, darn it.

634
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:07,932
People are still talking about this?

635
00:27:08,602 --> 00:27:09,602
I know.

636
00:27:09,603 --> 00:27:11,572
Sometimes, things just go your way in life.

637
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:13,772
Think of it as a little mishap.

638
00:27:14,402 --> 00:27:15,402
Right.

639
00:27:16,442 --> 00:27:17,671
I bet someone...

640
00:27:17,672 --> 00:27:19,612
from Yang Won Dae's camp is running this account.

641
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,542
I wonder who it is.

642
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:24,812
That's not important.

643
00:27:25,112 --> 00:27:28,422
What we know for certain is that the war of narratives has begun.

644
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,052
Narratives?

645
00:27:40,132 --> 00:27:41,202
Look at this.

646
00:27:41,502 --> 00:27:42,602
How would you describe this?

647
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,502
It has a square shape.

648
00:27:51,072 --> 00:27:53,212
What about now? Is it still shaped like a square?

649
00:27:53,812 --> 00:27:56,612
No. Now, it's just round.

650
00:27:56,982 --> 00:27:59,112
Yes. Now, that's the art of changing the narratives.

651
00:27:59,452 --> 00:28:02,352
People don't care about who you used to be.

652
00:28:02,422 --> 00:28:04,791
They will diminish and undermine you...

653
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:07,022
however they see fit.

654
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:08,662
So people only see...

655
00:28:09,722 --> 00:28:10,862
the worst side of you.

656
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,902
They will tarnish the image...

657
00:28:15,002 --> 00:28:16,302
of our entire campaign.

658
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:18,232
I see.

659
00:28:20,272 --> 00:28:22,802
Then what should I do then?

660
00:28:23,172 --> 00:28:25,872
You and I should just have a talk.

661
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:27,512
Just a talk.

662
00:28:29,112 --> 00:28:30,412
Perhaps,

663
00:28:31,082 --> 00:28:33,452
you may have the most important role in this election.

664
00:28:34,282 --> 00:28:36,121
Out of everyone in our camp,

665
00:28:36,122 --> 00:28:38,552
you know the most about Yang Won Dae's camp.

666
00:28:38,792 --> 00:28:40,792
You were in the choir up until recently.

667
00:28:40,892 --> 00:28:42,262
You're close to Park Ji Hun too.

668
00:28:42,622 --> 00:28:44,122
Yes. That's true.

669
00:28:45,632 --> 00:28:48,032
Then let's solve our problems one at a time.

670
00:28:49,702 --> 00:28:52,332
Any rumours or stories about our opposing candidates?

671
00:28:53,502 --> 00:28:54,502
Rumours?

672
00:28:54,602 --> 00:28:57,302
Yes. It could be rumours or just facts.

673
00:28:57,842 --> 00:29:01,212
You know them well. So any stories about them?

674
00:29:14,022 --> 00:29:15,761
(Candidate 1, Kwak Sang Hyeon)

675
00:29:15,762 --> 00:29:17,621
- Do you want to get malatang?
- No, we should get tteokbokki.

676
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:19,232
Come on. We had that yesterday.

677
00:29:19,262 --> 00:29:20,831
(Frog Witch, super rude, so annoying)

678
00:29:20,832 --> 00:29:22,501
Yoon Jeong Hui. You're quite popular.

679
00:29:22,502 --> 00:29:23,531
(Do you not know what "pretty" means?)

680
00:29:23,532 --> 00:29:24,732
Good for you.

681
00:29:26,372 --> 00:29:28,641
(Mr. Hard-on can't be the vice president.)

682
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:29,741
We're doomed.

683
00:29:29,742 --> 00:29:30,742
(Mr. Hard-on)

684
00:29:33,212 --> 00:29:34,212
It's all right.

685
00:29:35,012 --> 00:29:37,012
Hate comments are better than no comments.

686
00:29:37,682 --> 00:29:38,682
Sang Hyeon.

687
00:29:38,782 --> 00:29:41,322
(Candidate 2, Yang Won Dae)

688
00:29:41,452 --> 00:29:42,922
When you're running for office,

689
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:44,751
facing something like this is inevitable.

690
00:29:44,752 --> 00:29:45,792
(Mr. Hard-on can't be the vice president.)

691
00:29:48,592 --> 00:29:49,792
But smile.

692
00:29:50,192 --> 00:29:51,332
Those who smile will win in the end.

693
00:29:52,192 --> 00:29:54,032
In Gyeong went over it with you earlier.

694
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,562
The winning mentality.

695
00:29:57,802 --> 00:29:59,772
They were pretty good today.

696
00:29:59,972 --> 00:30:01,132
That goes for Ji Hun too.

697
00:30:03,842 --> 00:30:06,342
Anyway, let's do better tomorrow.

698
00:30:07,442 --> 00:30:08,482
- Okay.
- Okay.

699
00:30:08,742 --> 00:30:09,782
And Se Hoon.

700
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:11,382
Yes, Sang Hyeon.

701
00:30:13,012 --> 00:30:14,852
Don't embarrass me ever again.

702
00:30:17,652 --> 00:30:18,652
I won't.

703
00:30:19,092 --> 00:30:20,122
Bye.

704
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:21,462
See you tomorrow.

705
00:30:23,162 --> 00:30:24,222
Bye...

706
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:26,562
See you later, Sang Hyeon.

707
00:30:32,772 --> 00:30:33,802
Noh Se Hoon.

708
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:35,242
What?

709
00:30:36,342 --> 00:30:37,472
Do you want to go to Olive Young?

710
00:30:38,212 --> 00:30:39,212
What?

711
00:30:39,812 --> 00:30:41,172
You want to go to Olive Young?

712
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:44,482
Are you going there...

713
00:30:45,512 --> 00:30:46,852
to buy cosmetics?

714
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:50,852
Why not? Am I not allowed to buy them?

715
00:30:53,422 --> 00:30:54,592
You're kidding me.

716
00:30:55,392 --> 00:30:56,522
Do you have a death wish?

717
00:30:56,792 --> 00:30:58,762
Do you think I'm crazy? Why would I die in your hands?

718
00:30:59,392 --> 00:31:01,532
Forget it. If you don't want to go with me, then don't.

719
00:31:02,102 --> 00:31:03,902
What? Hey.

720
00:31:04,302 --> 00:31:06,232
So you don't have a tutoring session in 40-something minutes?

721
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:08,502
Hey. Wait up.

722
00:31:08,672 --> 00:31:10,402
I have to buy something from there too.

723
00:31:10,872 --> 00:31:12,272
- You're so annoying.
- Let's go.

724
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:15,742
Why did you buy women's cosmetics? That was random.

725
00:31:15,842 --> 00:31:17,382
Well, yes.

726
00:31:17,612 --> 00:31:18,712
It's for someone.

727
00:31:19,082 --> 00:31:20,212
Who is it for?

728
00:31:21,082 --> 00:31:22,122
It's a secret.

729
00:31:22,682 --> 00:31:24,552
I see. Suit yourself.

730
00:31:28,662 --> 00:31:30,461
We must do a better job campaigning tomorrow.

731
00:31:30,462 --> 00:31:32,092
- Bye.
- What?

732
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,202
- You're not taking the bus?
- No.

733
00:31:35,932 --> 00:31:38,132
I'm going to see an ophthalmologist.

734
00:31:39,332 --> 00:31:40,402
That sounds about right.

735
00:31:40,502 --> 00:31:42,302
It's a wonder your eyeballs haven't popped out yet...

736
00:31:42,772 --> 00:31:44,002
given how much you're trying to look good.

737
00:31:44,372 --> 00:31:46,342
Okay. Get lost.

738
00:31:46,612 --> 00:31:48,042
Okay. You too.

739
00:32:11,602 --> 00:32:12,632
What?

740
00:32:15,402 --> 00:32:17,542
(Ann Tae Oh)

741
00:32:18,612 --> 00:32:19,642
Hello?

742
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:22,011
Is this Noh Se Hoon, the 1st-year student of Class 4...

743
00:32:22,012 --> 00:32:23,442
in Youngjin High School?

744
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:25,652
Yes.

745
00:32:26,212 --> 00:32:27,352
It's you, Ann Tae Oh. Right?

746
00:32:27,982 --> 00:32:29,052
Yes. It's me.

747
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:32,452
What's this about? What did you call me?

748
00:32:32,792 --> 00:32:33,792
Hey, Se Hoon.

749
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,492
I found something interesting the other day.

750
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:39,492
But I don't know if you'll find it interesting or not.

751
00:32:40,332 --> 00:32:41,332
Interesting?

752
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:43,002
Yes.

753
00:32:43,232 --> 00:32:44,261
What's interesting?

754
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,432
I'll show it to you at school.

755
00:32:46,032 --> 00:32:48,341
But I don't want you to reveal me...

756
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:49,742
as your source.

757
00:32:49,972 --> 00:32:51,772
Okay. I won't expose you.

758
00:32:52,272 --> 00:32:54,472
Okay. Let's finish this at school.

759
00:32:57,012 --> 00:32:58,712
What was that about? That was random.

760
00:33:11,662 --> 00:33:12,692
My gosh.

761
00:33:46,862 --> 00:33:49,832
(Banpo General Hospital)

762
00:33:49,962 --> 00:33:52,072
(Emergency Medical Center)

763
00:33:52,372 --> 00:33:53,432
Noh Se!

764
00:33:55,102 --> 00:33:56,142
Jae Won.

765
00:33:58,172 --> 00:33:59,272
Hold this for me.

766
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:02,812
I heard it was a hit-and-run. Who was that scumbag?

767
00:34:02,982 --> 00:34:04,611
- Did they catch the guy?
- No.

768
00:34:04,612 --> 00:34:05,712
To be precise, it was an attempted hit-and-run.

769
00:34:06,082 --> 00:34:07,582
Darn it. Are you all right, Noh Se?

770
00:34:07,952 --> 00:34:08,952
Yes, Jae Won.

771
00:34:10,082 --> 00:34:11,152
Gosh, darn...

772
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,192
Hello.

773
00:34:15,092 --> 00:34:17,021
This is Jae Won. He's older than me.

774
00:34:17,022 --> 00:34:19,492
- I see. Is that so?
- I see.

775
00:34:20,732 --> 00:34:21,862
So...

776
00:34:22,262 --> 00:34:24,161
did he already graduate from high school?

777
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:26,032
No. I'm not anyway near graduating.

778
00:34:26,072 --> 00:34:28,072
My gosh. Right.

779
00:34:28,372 --> 00:34:30,542
Let me go and get some drinks.

780
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:31,872
No, it's all right.

781
00:34:32,012 --> 00:34:33,312
- No.
- No.

782
00:34:33,812 --> 00:34:35,712
We'll give you a moment to talk to your friends.

783
00:34:39,312 --> 00:34:40,612
Thank you.

784
00:34:46,492 --> 00:34:47,552
Why are you laughing?

785
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:50,392
You're so polite.

786
00:34:50,592 --> 00:34:52,762
You little... I could crack your neck.

787
00:34:53,992 --> 00:34:55,062
My gosh.

788
00:34:56,132 --> 00:34:57,532
So what happened?

789
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:59,372
He almost got run over by a motorcycle.

790
00:34:59,802 --> 00:35:01,742
Which delivery service does he work for?

791
00:35:02,242 --> 00:35:03,471
I'm not sure.

792
00:35:03,472 --> 00:35:04,912
It was just a black motorcycle.

793
00:35:05,112 --> 00:35:06,141
Did you catch the plate number?

794
00:35:06,142 --> 00:35:07,342
He was too startled to check.

795
00:35:08,912 --> 00:35:10,311
- My gosh.
- Hey.

796
00:35:10,312 --> 00:35:11,652
Darn it. Does he have a head injury?

797
00:35:11,912 --> 00:35:13,351
I had to get some stitches.

798
00:35:13,352 --> 00:35:14,412
- I got stitches there.
- How many weeks will it last?

799
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:15,982
It won't last that long.

800
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:17,351
He got four stitches.

801
00:35:17,352 --> 00:35:20,222
Darn it. You scared me for a second.

802
00:35:23,462 --> 00:35:25,092
Then why are you getting the IV drip?

803
00:35:25,162 --> 00:35:26,861
Well, it won't hurt.

804
00:35:26,862 --> 00:35:28,561
He did bleed.

805
00:35:28,562 --> 00:35:30,762
You're acting like a baby, you stupid jerk.

806
00:35:30,802 --> 00:35:33,472
Well, I was fine.

807
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:36,442
But Sang Hyeon told me to get whatever treatment they offered.

808
00:35:36,602 --> 00:35:38,911
Yes. He was dead set against getting admitted.

809
00:35:38,912 --> 00:35:41,442
Hey, he should get a beating if he gets admitted for this. Right?

810
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:43,782
- You little...
- Yes. Right.

811
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:47,582
Anyway, I'm sorry.

812
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:50,082
We just started campaigning.

813
00:35:50,552 --> 00:35:53,291
I hope I'm not inconveniencing the two of you because of...

814
00:35:53,292 --> 00:35:54,752
What do you mean? Are you trying to break my heart?

815
00:35:57,062 --> 00:35:59,391
Your legs are fine. You should join us.

816
00:35:59,392 --> 00:36:01,862
Yes. You jerk. Work twice as hard.

817
00:36:02,002 --> 00:36:03,231
This is nice. He'll earn some pity.

818
00:36:03,232 --> 00:36:05,402
Are you guys from Youngjin High School?

819
00:36:05,632 --> 00:36:06,972
- Yes.
- Yes.

820
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:08,032
Wait.

821
00:36:09,602 --> 00:36:10,602
What?

822
00:36:16,782 --> 00:36:17,842
Thank you.

823
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,052
Won Dae.

824
00:36:21,652 --> 00:36:22,882
What brings you here?

825
00:36:24,122 --> 00:36:25,252
It was you, Se Hoon.

826
00:36:28,822 --> 00:36:30,492
I'm glad you're okay.

827
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:33,732
Did you know I was here?

828
00:36:33,962 --> 00:36:36,832
Yes. They got a call about an injured student from our school.

829
00:36:37,602 --> 00:36:38,632
I see.

830
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:41,172
I see. Yes.

831
00:36:41,602 --> 00:36:44,071
You're an honorary member of the civilian police.

832
00:36:44,072 --> 00:36:45,572
So they gave you a call.

833
00:36:49,112 --> 00:36:51,852
I thought you came because you knew it was me.

834
00:36:53,352 --> 00:36:55,882
In a way, I guess I did. You're a student from our school.

835
00:36:56,752 --> 00:36:58,822
The police must have a lot of time on their hands...

836
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,492
seeing how they gave you a call.

837
00:37:03,562 --> 00:37:04,962
Well, you know how it is.

838
00:37:05,892 --> 00:37:07,792
I represent our school.

839
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,272
By the way, are your knees okay?

840
00:37:15,302 --> 00:37:16,302
What?

841
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:19,172
Oh, this?

842
00:37:20,142 --> 00:37:21,312
I skinned my knees earlier.

843
00:37:21,542 --> 00:37:22,782
I fell as I was rushing over.

844
00:37:22,942 --> 00:37:25,582
I see. You were rushing over here?

845
00:37:25,852 --> 00:37:27,882
- Yes.
- How did you get here?

846
00:37:30,222 --> 00:37:31,692
My motorcycle.

847
00:37:37,162 --> 00:37:38,632
What's the colour of your motorcycle?

848
00:37:43,062 --> 00:37:44,302
What are you insinuating?
