177
00:08:47,034 --> 00:08:48,104
Come on!

178
00:08:52,634 --> 00:08:53,844
- What?
- My gosh.

179
00:08:55,604 --> 00:08:56,674
Got a death wish?

180
00:08:58,144 --> 00:09:00,013
- Kang Jae Won!
- I'm not doing this, you losers!

181
00:09:00,014 --> 00:09:01,384
- Kang Jae Won!
- Kang Jae Won!

182
00:09:02,214 --> 00:09:04,254
All right, Kang Jae Won. Say something.

183
00:09:04,884 --> 00:09:06,454
- Make a speech!
- Say something.

184
00:09:07,454 --> 00:09:09,224
If you don't vote for number one, you'll all pay for...

185
00:09:10,794 --> 00:09:12,694
- Nice.
- Oh, my.

186
00:09:19,964 --> 00:09:21,504
Get this!

187
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,934
- One, two, three!
- One, two, three!

188
00:09:28,804 --> 00:09:30,274
- Hey, come on.
- What?

189
00:09:30,344 --> 00:09:31,474
- Hey, don't...
- My gosh!

190
00:09:34,544 --> 00:09:35,883
Go, Kwak Sang Hyeon!

191
00:09:35,884 --> 00:09:37,714
At some point, club activities...

192
00:09:38,754 --> 00:09:41,384
ended up feeling like just an extension of the classroom.

193
00:09:41,424 --> 00:09:43,223
- That's right!
- That's right!

194
00:09:43,224 --> 00:09:45,924
School, private academies, libraries, and tutoring sessions.

195
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:48,363
We, students, are stuck in this never-ending cycle...

196
00:09:48,364 --> 00:09:49,864
like hamsters on a wheel.

197
00:09:51,264 --> 00:09:54,234
We can't take it anymore.

198
00:09:55,104 --> 00:09:56,204
That's right.

199
00:09:56,564 --> 00:09:58,973
To promote a healthy hobby and recreational culture,

200
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:02,404
we, Candidate Number Two, will suggest...

201
00:10:02,474 --> 00:10:04,313
that the school create more diverse clubs...

202
00:10:04,314 --> 00:10:06,114
and provide funding to support their activities!

203
00:10:06,374 --> 00:10:07,983
(I only see you, No. 2 Ha Yu Gyeong.)

204
00:10:07,984 --> 00:10:10,783
Let's show everyone that those who know how to have fun...

205
00:10:10,784 --> 00:10:12,684
also do well in their studies!

206
00:10:12,854 --> 00:10:15,723
- Yes!
- Let's show them!

207
00:10:15,724 --> 00:10:19,023
(Live Support Ratings: Kwak Sang Hyeon versus Yang Won Dae)

208
00:10:19,024 --> 00:10:21,563
- Ha Yu Gyeong! Yang Won Dae!
- Ha Yu Gyeong! Yang Won Dae!

209
00:10:21,564 --> 00:10:23,733
- Let's take some photos!
- Ha Yu Gyeong! Yang Won Dae!

210
00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:25,134
- Gather around.
- Gather around, guys.

211
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:26,494
Make a V!

212
00:10:27,364 --> 00:10:29,433
One, two, three.

213
00:10:29,434 --> 00:10:31,804
- Number 2.
- Number 2.

214
00:10:32,904 --> 00:10:34,843
Last but not least, let's make a fist and shout together!

215
00:10:34,844 --> 00:10:36,814
- Yes, let's go!
- Let's go!

216
00:10:37,344 --> 00:10:39,273
- All right!
- Yes, let's go!

217
00:10:39,274 --> 00:10:41,413
One, two, three.

218
00:10:41,414 --> 00:10:43,854
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

219
00:10:44,384 --> 00:10:46,484
Go, Yang Won Dae!

220
00:10:46,554 --> 00:10:47,754
- Yes!
- Let's go!

221
00:10:47,924 --> 00:10:49,984
- Hey! What are you doing now?
- Hey!

222
00:10:50,124 --> 00:10:51,194
Hey, take this down!

223
00:10:52,424 --> 00:10:53,963
- Let's go!
- Darn it.

224
00:10:53,964 --> 00:10:55,494
- What is this?
- Who did this?

225
00:10:55,964 --> 00:10:58,034
- Come on!
- Hey!

226
00:10:58,934 --> 00:11:00,734
- Take it down!
- Come on, quick!

227
00:11:01,964 --> 00:11:04,804
(Together with No. 2, A School Where Students Come First)

228
00:11:15,314 --> 00:11:16,314
Hey, Park Ji Hun.

229
00:11:17,214 --> 00:11:18,284
How did it go?

230
00:11:18,954 --> 00:11:20,054
It was no big deal, right?

231
00:11:20,854 --> 00:11:22,554
I was told to come back after the election.

232
00:11:23,994 --> 00:11:25,254
Did you play dumb?

233
00:11:28,024 --> 00:11:30,134
- Yes.
- Hey, don't worry.

234
00:11:30,934 --> 00:11:33,764
They don't really seem to care about that right now.

235
00:11:34,034 --> 00:11:35,064
Really?

236
00:11:35,264 --> 00:11:38,204
Yes, for real. Apart from the voice, there's no evidence.

237
00:11:38,404 --> 00:11:39,804
Who'd believe that?

238
00:11:42,644 --> 00:11:43,914
Anyway, what are you doing here?

239
00:11:44,744 --> 00:11:46,844
I thought you were no longer allowed to participate in campaign rallies.

240
00:11:46,944 --> 00:11:49,513
Darn it. Hey, even Yu Ui Jun quit.

241
00:11:49,514 --> 00:11:50,784
I can't sit back and do nothing.

242
00:11:52,954 --> 00:11:54,024
That's true.

243
00:11:54,384 --> 00:11:55,424
Hey, Park Ji Hun.

244
00:11:56,024 --> 00:11:57,494
Just trust Won Dae and keep at it.

245
00:11:58,754 --> 00:12:01,194
Once this is all over, Won Dae will get everything sorted out.

246
00:12:06,464 --> 00:12:07,503
All right.

247
00:12:07,504 --> 00:12:09,404
Hey, don't be so bummed out.

248
00:12:11,534 --> 00:12:12,574
Hold this.

249
00:12:14,444 --> 00:12:16,144
- Here.
- Okay.

250
00:12:21,644 --> 00:12:22,814
Bring it on. Let's go.

251
00:12:25,054 --> 00:12:26,684
Yes, let's go.

252
00:12:34,324 --> 00:12:35,893
Hey! Don't push!

253
00:12:35,894 --> 00:12:37,994
What? What is going on?

254
00:12:41,134 --> 00:12:42,204
Yes.

255
00:12:42,334 --> 00:12:44,934
Hey, this is it!

256
00:12:45,374 --> 00:12:46,374
Let's go!

257
00:12:54,644 --> 00:12:56,143
Come on! Come at me!

258
00:12:56,144 --> 00:12:57,483
- Hey, come down.
- Oh, no!

259
00:12:57,484 --> 00:12:58,614
Guys, that's enough!

260
00:12:58,884 --> 00:13:00,454
- You guys. What are you doing?
- Hey!

261
00:13:01,624 --> 00:13:02,654
- Hey!
- What the...

262
00:13:03,354 --> 00:13:04,424
Hey!

263
00:13:05,324 --> 00:13:06,324
Back off. Stay away!

264
00:13:06,325 --> 00:13:07,464
(Reboot With Yang Won Dae!)

265
00:13:08,494 --> 00:13:10,763
- Hey!
- No! Stay away!

266
00:13:10,764 --> 00:13:12,364
Darn it. My nipples!

267
00:13:13,064 --> 00:13:14,934
- No, stop.
- Hey!

268
00:13:15,164 --> 00:13:16,764
- Hey!
- Over here!

269
00:13:17,374 --> 00:13:18,974
- Get this!
- Here!

270
00:13:19,434 --> 00:13:20,904
- Here you go!
- No!

271
00:13:23,504 --> 00:13:24,573
(Make some popcorn. This is so amusing.)

272
00:13:24,574 --> 00:13:25,673
(Today, I noticed how hot Kang Jae Won is.)

273
00:13:25,674 --> 00:13:26,674
(With Jae Won, No. 1 will win, right?)

274
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:28,613
Hey! Who's your class president?

275
00:13:28,614 --> 00:13:30,713
- Hey!
- Nam Gyeong Tae!

276
00:13:30,714 --> 00:13:32,254
What are you doing? Roll it back down.

277
00:13:33,214 --> 00:13:34,753
That's enough!

278
00:13:34,754 --> 00:13:36,724
- Hey!
- What? I was just...

279
00:13:39,524 --> 00:13:41,363
Kwak Sang Hyeon, do you only have thugs on your team?

280
00:13:41,364 --> 00:13:43,463
Hey, why do you keep messing with my team?

281
00:13:43,464 --> 00:13:44,793
They're already on edge as it is.

282
00:13:44,794 --> 00:13:46,663
So are we. You aren't the only ones on edge!

283
00:13:46,664 --> 00:13:48,503
Hey! Stop, okay?

284
00:13:48,504 --> 00:13:50,133
You stop first, Yoon Jeong Hui.

285
00:13:50,134 --> 00:13:51,633
Hey, be quiet when your upperclassmen are talking.

286
00:13:51,634 --> 00:13:52,703
- What's your problem?
- Stop pointing fingers.

287
00:13:52,704 --> 00:13:54,744
Don't cross the line. You call this a campaign rally?

288
00:13:55,244 --> 00:13:57,774
Who provoked us first? Don't you see that my boys got hurt?

289
00:13:57,944 --> 00:14:00,513
I saw what happened. They bumped into each other and got hurt!

290
00:14:00,514 --> 00:14:02,743
That's not true. You threw ice at them first!

291
00:14:02,744 --> 00:14:04,013
No, it was a mistake.

292
00:14:04,014 --> 00:14:05,154
Don't say anything if you don't know!

293
00:14:05,584 --> 00:14:06,654
Don't hit us.

294
00:14:07,084 --> 00:14:09,483
- Why did you hit me? Don't hit us.
- Whatever.

295
00:14:09,484 --> 00:14:11,023
- Seriously!
- Hey! Stop that, okay?

296
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:12,654
- Stop recording!
- Don't get mad at me.

297
00:14:16,124 --> 00:14:17,134
Hey!

298
00:14:18,034 --> 00:14:19,193
You guys, what are you doing?

299
00:14:19,194 --> 00:14:20,403
(Reboot With Yang Won Dae!)

300
00:14:20,404 --> 00:14:21,734
Break it up. Now.

301
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:24,033
Hey! Why are you pulling his pants down?

302
00:14:24,034 --> 00:14:26,204
- Pull them back up! Goodness.
- They did this!

303
00:14:26,374 --> 00:14:28,974
Hey! What on earth are you guys doing?

304
00:14:29,144 --> 00:14:31,844
You guys! Stop fighting. Stop!

305
00:14:32,644 --> 00:14:34,513
- Hey! Stop.
- Mr. Sin.

306
00:14:34,514 --> 00:14:36,783
- Hey! That's enough.
- Darn it!

307
00:14:36,784 --> 00:14:39,484
Hey, guys! Stop, okay?

308
00:14:39,784 --> 00:14:41,523
- That's enough, all right?
- Mr. Sin.

309
00:14:41,524 --> 00:14:42,583
- What?
- Over there...

310
00:14:42,584 --> 00:14:44,694
Go and stop them. Go!

311
00:14:47,564 --> 00:14:49,894
- Hey!
- Go away!

312
00:14:49,994 --> 00:14:52,264
- Hey.
- What's your deal?

313
00:14:53,534 --> 00:14:55,503
Go, Sang Hyeon!

314
00:14:55,504 --> 00:14:57,433
- Everybody, vote for Sang Hyeon!
- Everybody, vote for Sang Hyeon!

315
00:14:57,434 --> 00:14:59,274
Go, Number One!

316
00:15:02,344 --> 00:15:04,214
You jerk!

317
00:15:10,114 --> 00:15:11,214
Hey, Nam Gyeong Tae!

318
00:15:12,154 --> 00:15:13,654
You're so dead.

319
00:15:13,824 --> 00:15:15,954
- Hey, your wig.
- Move.

320
00:15:18,424 --> 00:15:20,324
You punk. Have you really lost your mind?

321
00:15:20,824 --> 00:15:22,724
Darn you. Are you completely disrespectful?

322
00:15:23,694 --> 00:15:24,734
Oh, no.

323
00:15:26,234 --> 00:15:27,404
Get him.

324
00:15:27,434 --> 00:15:29,064
- Go.
- Hey!

325
00:15:29,504 --> 00:15:31,274
No, let me... Darn it.

326
00:15:31,434 --> 00:15:33,374
- Hey!
- No, don't.

327
00:15:34,274 --> 00:15:36,974
- Hey!
- What? Stop pushing!

328
00:15:38,344 --> 00:15:41,313
We all entered this war...

329
00:15:41,314 --> 00:15:42,944
for various personal reasons,

330
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,684
but in the home stretch of the election,

331
00:15:45,254 --> 00:15:47,754
those reasons don't really matter anymore.

332
00:15:49,354 --> 00:15:51,324
We had to win, no matter what.

333
00:15:51,724 --> 00:15:53,054
And to win...

334
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:56,424
in this battlefield where the war only ends when the opponent falls,

335
00:15:57,024 --> 00:16:00,164
there was no longer any room to retreat or concede.

336
00:16:02,234 --> 00:16:04,133
Finally, election day has arrived.

337
00:16:04,134 --> 00:16:05,734
The final campaign rally has ended.

338
00:16:06,374 --> 00:16:08,873
The two camps, whose emotional divide had deepened over time,

339
00:16:08,874 --> 00:16:11,714
ultimately reached a point of physical confrontation.

340
00:16:12,244 --> 00:16:13,983
They were able to avoid a dangerous situation...

341
00:16:13,984 --> 00:16:16,214
when the Election Commission stepped in.

342
00:16:16,984 --> 00:16:20,084
In the final stretch of the election,

343
00:16:20,284 --> 00:16:22,754
with various personal attacks, slander,

344
00:16:22,884 --> 00:16:25,723
and fake news spreading targeting the candidates,

345
00:16:25,724 --> 00:16:27,963
more and more student voters...

346
00:16:27,964 --> 00:16:29,624
are choosing to skip voting altogether.

347
00:16:30,494 --> 00:16:32,894
All right. I'll see you at the voting booth.

348
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,564
YJBS, this is Ko Young Chan.

349
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:37,603
- Well done.
- Good work.

350
00:16:37,604 --> 00:16:40,034
- Good job.
- Let's take down the tent.

351
00:16:40,104 --> 00:16:41,403
- Here.
- The tent?

352
00:16:41,404 --> 00:16:43,574
- Well done, guys.
- Hey, it's no big deal.

353
00:16:44,144 --> 00:16:45,573
- Oh, boy.
- Come on.

354
00:16:45,574 --> 00:16:47,183
- It really hurt.
- You'll be fine.

355
00:16:47,184 --> 00:16:48,244
Oh, dear.

356
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:51,954

Which one of you wanted to be a teacher?

358
00:16:55,054 --> 00:16:56,453
- Me.
- You, Jeong Ah?

359
00:16:56,454 --> 00:16:58,724
- Yes.
- Do not become a teacher.

360
00:17:00,494 --> 00:17:01,863
Don't become a school teacher.

361
00:17:01,864 --> 00:17:03,394
Learn a useful skill instead, Jeong Ah.

362
00:17:04,034 --> 00:17:05,064
Okay.

363
00:17:06,294 --> 00:17:07,933
- Oh, Mr. Sin.
- Yes?

364
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:09,334
Isn't that a police car?

365
00:17:10,974 --> 00:17:12,034
Yes.

366
00:17:12,234 --> 00:17:13,843
- Well done, So Young.
- Good work.

367
00:17:13,844 --> 00:17:14,874
You know how I feel, right?

368
00:17:15,804 --> 00:17:16,943
- A police car?
- Did someone call the police?

369
00:17:16,944 --> 00:17:18,744
- What's going on?
- What is this?

370
00:17:19,274 --> 00:17:21,214
- Oh, the cops are here.
- What's going on?

371
00:17:21,644 --> 00:17:22,944
What is this?

372
00:17:23,284 --> 00:17:25,583
Hello, some neighbours must've called the police.

373
00:17:25,584 --> 00:17:27,224
We're all done here.

374
00:17:27,384 --> 00:17:28,853
No, it's not that.

375
00:17:28,854 --> 00:17:30,153
- Okay.
- It's an assault case.

376
00:17:30,154 --> 00:17:31,494
- Assault?
- Assault?

377
00:17:31,724 --> 00:17:32,794
What's going on?

378
00:17:36,164 --> 00:17:38,034
- Who is that?
- Some guy.

379
00:17:39,164 --> 00:17:41,703
- Shoot.
- What the heck's going on?

380
00:17:41,704 --> 00:17:43,973
- Isn't that Hee Chan?
- Someone's in the car, right?

381
00:17:43,974 --> 00:17:46,203
- Who is it?
- He got beaten up.

382
00:17:46,204 --> 00:17:48,644
- Gosh.
- He's glaring.

383
00:17:50,544 --> 00:17:51,574
Darn it.

384
00:17:53,774 --> 00:17:56,384
I don't believe this.

385
00:17:58,014 --> 00:18:00,824
What do you want to do, then?

386
00:18:03,784 --> 00:18:07,124
First, shut down the social media account.

387
00:18:07,924 --> 00:18:11,094
And sell me your phone and your home PC.

388
00:18:13,094 --> 00:18:14,804
I don't know anything.

389
00:18:15,534 --> 00:18:17,673
I don't even know what that account is.

390
00:18:17,674 --> 00:18:20,133
I'm not on social media at all.

391
00:18:20,134 --> 00:18:21,604
I'm sorry,

392
00:18:22,574 --> 00:18:24,374
but we traced the IP to you.

393
00:18:28,114 --> 00:18:30,114
That's a lie.

394
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,954
I'll get you a new phone.

395
00:18:33,414 --> 00:18:35,154
So give me yours.

Hey.

401
00:18:52,104 --> 00:18:53,434
Are you threatening me?

402
00:18:54,374 --> 00:18:55,974
So what? You'll lynch me?

403
00:18:56,574 --> 00:18:58,974

406
00:19:06,984 --> 00:19:08,254
Screw it.

407
00:19:11,594 --> 00:19:13,354
What the heck, you punks?

408
00:19:13,554 --> 00:19:14,594
Come at me.

409
00:19:14,694 --> 00:19:16,364
Fight me if you can.

410
00:19:16,494 --> 00:19:18,494
Come on, take me on.

411
00:19:27,134 --> 00:19:28,204
Get him!

412
00:19:58,234 --> 00:20:00,534
Kang Jae Won. That's enough. Stop it.

Did you see something?

417

- What's going on?
- I don't know.

418
00:20:24,764 --> 00:20:26,694
- Darn it.
- Yes, hello.

419
00:20:27,464 --> 00:20:29,504
We have a problem.

420
00:20:30,364 --> 00:20:32,974
- No, it's not that.
- You take this for me.

421
00:20:33,504 --> 00:20:34,544
Okay.

422
00:20:34,604 --> 00:20:35,604
Yes.

423
00:20:35,904 --> 00:20:38,114
Okay. I got it. Bye.

Hey.

426
00:20:47,724 --> 00:20:49,324
I'll send you a lawyer.

427
00:20:49,984 --> 00:20:51,554

00:20:56,724 --> 00:20:58,134
Do this for me.

430
00:21:00,164 --> 00:21:02,904
I said we shouldn't do it, bastard.

431

This always happens.

438
00:21:20,954 --> 00:21:22,154
Are you here about him?

439
00:21:22,584 --> 00:21:25,123
- Are you Kang Jae Won?
- Pack up and go inside.

440
00:21:25,124 --> 00:21:27,194
Let's go already. It's humiliating.

441
00:21:29,124 --> 00:21:30,193
He's getting in?

442
00:21:30,194 --> 00:21:31,663
Are you proud of what you did?

443
00:21:31,664 --> 00:21:33,234
Pack up and get inside.

444
00:21:34,704 --> 00:21:36,733
- We're off, then.
- Okay.

445
00:21:36,734 --> 00:21:39,274
- What happened?
- He's going with them?

446
00:21:40,274 --> 00:21:41,803
Can you get out of the way?

447
00:21:41,804 --> 00:21:43,374
- We'll leave.
- Step aside.

We have a slight advantage,

451
00:22:02,464 --> 00:22:04,894
but it's within the margin of error, so we can't relax just yet.

452

That's okay.

453
00:22:07,194 --> 00:22:09,504
We still have the final speech, so let's crush them with that.

454
00:22:11,904 --> 00:22:14,844
This isn't the time to care about...

455
00:22:15,304 --> 00:22:16,773
why we decided to run,

456
00:22:16,774 --> 00:22:18,144
or what mistakes we made.

457
00:22:18,814 --> 00:22:21,984
If we win, none of that matters.

00:22:23,014 --> 00:22:25,284
The friends and teachers who helped us.

459
00:22:26,084 --> 00:22:28,584
We trust them and keep going, okay?

460
00:22:29,284 --> 00:22:30,554
- Okay.
- Okay.

- Okay.
- Okay.

469
00:22:53,114 --> 00:22:55,344
You meant to run with Yang Won Dae.

00:22:56,314 --> 00:22:58,084
Why did you switch sides?

00:22:59,554 --> 00:23:00,584
Sang Hyeon.

472
00:23:01,554 --> 00:23:04,954
Do you know the difference between "need" and "want?"

473
00:23:08,694 --> 00:23:11,764
A necessary item or a preferential item.

474
00:23:11,994 --> 00:23:14,863
Hey. Did Mr. Sin tell you too?

475
00:23:14,864 --> 00:23:17,834
No. That was all me.

476
00:23:18,004 --> 00:23:20,574
What? What do you mean?

477
00:23:20,944 --> 00:23:23,574
We met outside a convenience store.

478
00:23:24,614 --> 00:23:26,014
Did you think it was a coincidence?

479
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:30,313
I'd heard Won Dae had found a running mate...

480
00:23:30,314 --> 00:23:31,854
to campaign with already.

481
00:23:33,114 --> 00:23:34,254
I wanted to find out...

482
00:23:36,024 --> 00:23:38,094
who the guy was that Won Dae had picked.

483
00:23:39,124 --> 00:23:40,124
I see.

484
00:23:46,834 --> 00:23:47,864
Why?

485
00:23:48,904 --> 00:23:50,634
Do you have regrets now?

486
00:23:51,704 --> 00:23:52,734
No.

487
00:23:53,304 --> 00:23:54,644
I wouldn't call it a regret.

488
00:23:54,774 --> 00:23:57,204
Good. Don't have regrets.

489
00:23:58,414 --> 00:24:00,144
That's for losers.

490
00:24:01,584 --> 00:24:02,614
Losers.

491
00:24:05,314 --> 00:24:06,414
The guys...

492
00:24:07,284 --> 00:24:09,124
who treated you like a loser.

493
00:24:10,754 --> 00:24:13,554

498
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:27,604
This election...

499
00:24:28,004 --> 00:24:30,574
had a fierce rivalry we'd never seen before.

500
00:24:31,214 --> 00:24:33,344
Sometimes, things went too far,

501
00:24:33,374 --> 00:24:36,344
causing some to frown in disgust and disappointment.

502
00:24:36,584 --> 00:24:37,654
But...

503
00:24:37,984 --> 00:24:40,284
that passion of yours...

504
00:24:40,954 --> 00:24:42,754
makes you the owners of this school,

505
00:24:43,184 --> 00:24:45,824
and in the future, the owners of this country.

506
00:24:46,494 --> 00:24:49,564
You're practicing and showing how democracy works,

507
00:24:50,024 --> 00:24:51,894
so I'm somewhat pleased too.

508
00:24:52,934 --> 00:24:54,463
The best outcome...

509
00:24:54,464 --> 00:24:57,304
is to find the best option and support that.

510

- and accepting the result.
- When will this end?

547
00:26:19,814 --> 00:26:22,284

00:33:33,614 --> 00:33:35,254
He's out of it, isn't he?

715
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:36,754
Hey!

716
00:33:36,954 --> 00:33:38,024
Forget it.

717
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,494
He's done for.

718
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:42,994
- He can't do anything now.
- You think?

719
00:33:43,464 --> 00:33:45,133
You should watch what you say.

720
00:33:45,134 --> 00:33:46,764
Face the front, everyone.

721
00:33:50,434 --> 00:33:53,003
That's nothing. It's a boring trick.

722
00:33:53,004 --> 00:33:54,503
- What was that?
- He smashed it?

723
00:33:54,504 --> 00:33:56,044
That costs a fortune.

724
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:02,314
(75th Youngjin High Presidential Candidates' Speech)

725
00:34:04,744 --> 00:34:06,414
Forget the boring speech I prepared.

726
00:34:07,914 --> 00:34:09,824
I'll say what I really want to say.

727
00:34:11,324 --> 00:34:12,524
First of all.

728
00:34:13,824 --> 00:34:15,724
The campaigners who helped me.

729
00:34:16,264 --> 00:34:17,824
You did great.

730
00:34:19,094 --> 00:34:20,194
I know.

731
00:34:21,294 --> 00:34:23,434
I brag, show off,

732
00:34:23,904 --> 00:34:25,234
and I'm two-faced.

733
00:34:27,234 --> 00:34:29,744
But thank you for putting up with it all.

734
00:34:30,774 --> 00:34:31,814
And I'm sorry.

735
00:34:33,314 --> 00:34:35,143
It's okay, Sang Hyeon. Right, guys?

736
00:34:35,144 --> 00:34:36,683
- It's fine.
- It's okay.

737
00:34:36,684 --> 00:34:38,083
- We're okay.
- We don't mind.

738
00:34:38,084 --> 00:34:39,483
- It's okay.
- Keep going.

739
00:34:39,484 --> 00:34:41,113
- Forget it.
- We're cool.

740
00:34:41,114 --> 00:34:44,024
What exactly is going on?

741
00:34:44,224 --> 00:34:45,254
You're handsome!

742
00:34:46,754 --> 00:34:49,094
I recruited Jeong Hui to the team...

743
00:34:49,694 --> 00:34:51,694
because she was top of her class.

744
00:34:52,334 --> 00:34:54,594
I needed her to win over the teachers.

745
00:34:55,504 --> 00:34:56,734
To be honest,

746
00:34:57,734 --> 00:34:59,204
I used her.

747
00:35:01,274 --> 00:35:02,474
I'm sorry, Jeong Hui.

748
00:35:04,174 --> 00:35:06,374
I had fun campaigning with you.

749
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:08,114
I learned a lot too.

750
00:35:09,544 --> 00:35:12,584
Ann Tae Oh. What do you think about that comment?

751
00:35:13,054 --> 00:35:15,483
To win over people who were sick of the negativity,

752
00:35:15,484 --> 00:35:17,924
Yang Won Dae sacrificed Nam Gyeong Tae.

753
00:35:18,084 --> 00:35:19,454
Sang Hyeon did the opposite.

754
00:35:20,024 --> 00:35:21,694
What do you mean?

755
00:35:21,924 --> 00:35:24,824
Won Dae said he'd punish wrong with a just punishment.

756
00:35:24,894 --> 00:35:25,964
Sang Hyeon countered that...

757
00:35:26,394 --> 00:35:28,663
with reflection and gratitude.

758
00:35:28,664 --> 00:35:30,703
Oh, reflection and gratitude?

759
00:35:30,704 --> 00:35:31,904
Why did he do that?

760
00:35:32,834 --> 00:35:36,244
He knows that looks better and is more humane.

761
00:35:36,474 --> 00:35:37,544
Not bad.

762
00:35:38,044 --> 00:35:41,074
Yes. Kwak Sang Hyeon's a narcissistic.

763
00:35:41,414 --> 00:35:44,313
And Yang Won Dae's a perfect sociopath.

764
00:35:44,314 --> 00:35:45,654
Will you be quiet?

765
00:35:45,784 --> 00:35:48,114
Hey, go watch in your own classroom.

(Youngjin High School)

767
00:36:01,164 --> 00:36:02,564
And to be honest...

768
00:36:03,964 --> 00:36:05,374
On my birthday,

769
00:36:07,134 --> 00:36:08,844
I threw a party at my place.

770
00:36:10,444 --> 00:36:13,344
Yes. The rumour about the drinking party.

771
00:36:15,414 --> 00:36:16,614
It's true.

772
00:36:19,384 --> 00:36:21,284
That wasn't the first time.

773
00:36:21,584 --> 00:36:22,954
It had happened before.

774
00:36:23,784 --> 00:36:25,254
I'm sorry for lying to you all.

775
00:36:26,124 --> 00:36:28,764
Jeong Hui and Se Hoon were just there to celebrate.

776
00:36:29,264 --> 00:36:30,394
Sorry for involving you.

777
00:36:32,994 --> 00:36:34,764
Ji Hun's forged report card...

778
00:36:35,964 --> 00:36:38,034
that caused a ruckus yesterday.

779
00:36:38,704 --> 00:36:40,834
The person who posted about it anonymously.

780
00:36:42,674 --> 00:36:43,674
That was me.

781
00:36:44,474 --> 00:36:47,074
I made the recording behind Se Hoon's back.

782
00:36:48,544 --> 00:36:49,914
I'm sorry, Ji Hun.

783
00:36:50,384 --> 00:36:52,254
That was despicable of me.

784
00:36:52,654 --> 00:36:54,313
- You scumbag.
- Resign already.

785
00:36:54,314 --> 00:36:56,684
I told you he was up to something.

786
00:36:58,524 --> 00:37:00,224
Don't get the wrong idea, Ji Hun.

787
00:37:00,824 --> 00:37:03,094
Se Hoon had no idea I'd made the recording.

788
00:37:03,724 --> 00:37:05,664
He wanted to keep it a secret.

789
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:09,364
I practically used Se Hoon as well.

790
00:37:23,914 --> 00:37:24,914
Sang Hyeon.

791
00:37:27,354 --> 00:37:29,384
Do you even know...

792
00:37:30,754 --> 00:37:32,024
what is actually humiliating?

793
00:37:32,454 --> 00:37:33,454
What?

794
00:37:35,624 --> 00:37:36,924
Confess.

795
00:37:37,824 --> 00:37:38,964
What are you talking about?

796
00:37:40,464 --> 00:37:42,334
Your birthday drinking party.

797
00:37:42,864 --> 00:37:44,063
Tell the truth about it.

798
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,174
Are you crazy?

799
00:37:48,034 --> 00:37:49,273
Leave the stage.

800
00:37:49,274 --> 00:37:50,574
Turn the tables.

801
00:37:52,114 --> 00:37:53,974
Your two-faced nature as a show-off.

802
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:56,544
You must break that to win.

803
00:37:56,744 --> 00:37:57,844
What did you say?

804
00:37:58,654 --> 00:37:59,654
My nature as a show-off?

805
00:37:59,884 --> 00:38:00,884
Yes.

806
00:38:01,314 --> 00:38:03,054
Exposing yourself is better than losing.

807
00:38:03,624 --> 00:38:05,094
Admit to it all and let it go.

808
00:38:07,324 --> 00:38:08,394
Have you lost your mind?

809
00:38:09,294 --> 00:38:10,294
Yes.

810
00:38:10,594 --> 00:38:12,964
Talk to them as if you're talking to me now.

811
00:38:14,094 --> 00:38:15,904
There's no way you'll win...

812
00:38:16,604 --> 00:38:18,264

813

- What's going on?

814
00:38:40,254 --> 00:38:42,364
- What the heck?
- Is it another show?

815
00:38:42,464 --> 00:38:43,964
- What's this?
- I don't know.

816
00:38:43,994 --> 00:38:45,233
- Look.
- Get back up.

817
00:38:45,234 --> 00:38:46,634
It's another ploy.

818
00:38:46,734 --> 00:38:48,234
Everything got messed up...

819
00:38:49,464 --> 00:38:50,864
because of me.

820
00:38:52,234 --> 00:38:53,604
Don't go after anyone else.
