00:00:02,133 --> 00:00:03,233

00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:16,983
(I Am A Running Mate)

3
00:00:22,013 --> 00:00:24,453
- Let's have coffee first.
- I heard something earlier.

4
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:27,793
That you were there.

5
00:00:28,323 --> 00:00:30,093
At Kwak Sang Hyeon's birthday drinking party.

6
00:00:31,923 --> 00:00:32,963
Oh, that?

7
00:00:33,763 --> 00:00:36,263
I didn't drink that day.

8
00:00:37,403 --> 00:00:38,533
So...

9
00:00:39,063 --> 00:00:40,803
you did go there, right?

10
00:00:41,173 --> 00:00:42,703
And there was a drinking party too.

11
00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:45,003
Yes.

12
00:00:49,543 --> 00:00:51,313
Why did you go to the party?

13
00:00:52,513 --> 00:00:55,083
What are you? Tell me.

14
00:00:55,213 --> 00:00:57,182
Won Dae. There seems to be a misunderstanding.

15
00:00:57,183 --> 00:00:58,223
Give me your phone.

16
00:00:59,323 --> 00:01:00,323
What?

17
00:01:00,823 --> 00:01:02,493
Ha Yu Gyeong. Are you a spy?

18
00:01:03,193 --> 00:01:04,392
No, I'm not.

19
00:01:04,393 --> 00:01:05,862
Then give me your phone.

20
00:01:05,863 --> 00:01:07,392
- Won Dae...
- Stop with that expression.

21
00:01:07,393 --> 00:01:08,763
I'm about to lose it right now.

22
00:01:17,643 --> 00:01:19,303
- Won Dae!
- I'm only going to check.

23
00:01:23,043 --> 00:01:24,043
Unlock it.

24
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:55,113
Ha Yu Gyeong.

25
00:01:56,713 --> 00:01:57,713
Yes?

26
00:01:58,213 --> 00:01:59,283
Lift your head up.

27
00:02:02,713 --> 00:02:05,153
Ji Hun. We're done here. Come over here.

28
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:25,743
Yu Gyeong. I won't say another word about your private life.

29
00:02:26,173 --> 00:02:27,443
But get it together during the election.

30
00:02:28,173 --> 00:02:29,173
I will.

31
00:02:29,443 --> 00:02:31,383
We're all good, right?

32
00:02:39,823 --> 00:02:40,853
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:41,593 --> 00:02:43,523
I had no choice after what I heard.

34
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:47,033
Don't take it too personally, okay?

35
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:49,832
I'm not a spy.

36
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,963
All of us just get along really well.

37
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,643
I get it, okay? Just focus on the election from now on.

38
00:02:59,073 --> 00:03:00,673
If anyone at school asks,

39
00:03:00,943 --> 00:03:02,472
just say you got there late...

40
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:03,543
and didn't know anything.

41
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,143
Not even about the drinking. Got it?

42
00:03:08,883 --> 00:03:09,923
Yes.

43
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,093
From now on,

44
00:03:16,093 --> 00:03:17,693
you have my full trust.

45
00:03:18,663 --> 00:03:19,763
Okay?

46
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:23,003
Yes.

47
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:28,203
I'm sorry, Yu Gyeong. And I mean it.

48
00:03:31,973 --> 00:03:33,043
You too, Ji Hun.

49
00:03:33,973 --> 00:03:35,343
Don't worry too much.

50
00:03:37,943 --> 00:03:38,943
Okay.

51
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,952
All right. Let's work hard again starting tomorrow...

52
00:03:43,953 --> 00:03:45,052
and give it our all.

53
00:03:45,053 --> 00:03:46,183
- Okay.
- Okay.

54
00:03:47,623 --> 00:03:50,563
(I Am A Running Mate)

55
00:03:51,723 --> 00:03:55,633
(Episode 6: A Starry Night)

56
00:05:41,573 --> 00:05:43,243
- Hey.
- What?

57
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:46,302
This is a screenshot from that jerk's drinking party video.

58
00:05:46,303 --> 00:05:47,943
- Have a look.
- Drinking party? With whom?

59
00:05:48,343 --> 00:05:49,343
Look.

60
00:05:51,043 --> 00:05:52,383
Look at the place. Where is this?

61
00:05:52,943 --> 00:05:55,053
It's Kwak Sang Hyeon's house.

62
00:05:56,653 --> 00:05:58,253
Didn't he say he lives in an apartment?

63
00:05:58,523 --> 00:06:01,292
As you can tell, the place has been remodelled.

64
00:06:01,293 --> 00:06:02,992
Several apartments have been knocked through.

65
00:06:02,993 --> 00:06:05,023
It's totally illegal. Darn it.

66
00:06:07,063 --> 00:06:10,203
Hey, this guy is the first-year onion head.

67
00:06:10,363 --> 00:06:11,962
He's drunk and fighting.

68
00:06:11,963 --> 00:06:13,233
I'm telling you,

69
00:06:13,433 --> 00:06:15,573
that hit-and-run story? It's a total lie.

70
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:17,672
He must've gotten hurt in some drunken fight.

71
00:06:17,673 --> 00:06:19,102
That darn onion head.

72
00:06:19,103 --> 00:06:20,572
There was the sexual harassment thing earlier.

73
00:06:20,573 --> 00:06:22,243
Those scumbags.

74
00:06:22,813 --> 00:06:24,442
As they say, birds of a feather.

75
00:06:24,443 --> 00:06:25,943
- Son of a gun.
- These little...

76
00:06:26,413 --> 00:06:28,453
- Let's go.
- Wait for me.

77
00:06:36,393 --> 00:06:38,323
They had a photo of the birthday party.

78
00:06:38,823 --> 00:06:41,263
He must've come that day, right?

79
00:06:42,993 --> 00:06:44,003
Not him.

80
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,333
No?

81
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,572
But I clearly...

82
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,033
It was his older brother.

83
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,443
There was one college student. Do you remember?

84
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:57,343
I want to transfer schools.

85
00:06:57,813 --> 00:06:59,042
Let me vote for you too!

86
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,683
Come on. You should care more about your GPA, college guy.

87
00:07:03,853 --> 00:07:06,692
Yes, I remember. Then it's his younger brother?

88
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:09,122
For an adult to take secret videos of teens.

89
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:10,223
That scumbag.

90
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:14,233
What will you do about that college guy?

91
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:17,133
What do you mean?

92
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:18,663
What would I do?

93
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:21,133
Well...

94
00:07:21,973 --> 00:07:24,573
I thought you would take action.

95
00:07:24,873 --> 00:07:25,973
"Take action?"

96
00:07:27,913 --> 00:07:29,513
Seriously?

97
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:33,083
- Listen, Noh Se.
- Yes?

98
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:37,653
I think you've got something seriously mixed up.

99
00:07:39,023 --> 00:07:42,093
This might sound laughable coming from me.

100
00:07:48,993 --> 00:07:50,933
But no matter how bad the situation is,

101
00:07:52,603 --> 00:07:54,703
you can't go around acting like a jerk.

102
00:07:56,603 --> 00:07:58,273
Or else, you can screw yourself over.

103
00:07:59,303 --> 00:08:00,313
Get it?

104
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:04,913
Keep making the same mistakes and...

105
00:08:06,283 --> 00:08:07,483
What was that again?

106
00:08:08,783 --> 00:08:09,953
You get the point, right?

107
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:19,933
Gosh. Come on.

108
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,933
Let's grab a bite. I'm hungry.

109
00:08:28,373 --> 00:08:30,743
Jae Won. I'm screwed.

110
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,283
(Noh Se)

111
00:08:44,383 --> 00:08:45,383
Hey, Noh Se.

112
00:08:45,384 --> 00:08:47,223
Choi Jong Su! Where are you...

113
00:08:48,123 --> 00:08:49,123
What?

114
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,463
Darn it. My phone is dead.

115
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:59,203
Hey, Nam Gyeong Tae. Where are you?

116
00:09:01,873 --> 00:09:02,873
Darn it.

117
00:09:04,643 --> 00:09:05,673
What did he say?

118
00:09:06,073 --> 00:09:08,343
- To get lost.
- Does he have a death wish?

119
00:09:08,473 --> 00:09:10,083
- Hang on tight.
- Okay.

120
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:35,633
He's here.

121
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:49,583
Here, Jae Won.

122
00:09:59,823 --> 00:10:00,893
Nam Gyeong Tae!

123
00:10:03,963 --> 00:10:05,163
Nam Gyeong Tae!

124
00:10:05,803 --> 00:10:06,933
- What the...
- Stop!

125
00:10:10,403 --> 00:10:11,843
I kept shouting your name.

126
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:13,913
What do you want?

127
00:10:17,143 --> 00:10:19,283
I have nothing to say to you.

128
00:10:20,783 --> 00:10:21,883
Forget about that.

129
00:10:23,883 --> 00:10:25,523
I had something to ask you,

130
00:10:26,023 --> 00:10:27,093
but forgot.

131
00:10:29,393 --> 00:10:30,463
That coward.

132
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,793
He could've told me sooner.

133
00:10:35,193 --> 00:10:37,763
Let's talk tomorrow, okay? Go in.

134
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:40,733
Crazy jerk.

135
00:10:41,103 --> 00:10:42,173
You must be joking.

136
00:10:51,883 --> 00:10:52,883
What?

137
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:55,483
What the heck?

138
00:11:00,423 --> 00:11:01,493
Darn it.

139
00:11:02,753 --> 00:11:04,223
Are you okay?

140
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,893
Yes.

141
00:11:07,193 --> 00:11:10,763
But this person... Wait. Are you okay?

142
00:11:27,683 --> 00:11:29,383
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

143
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:34,993
What was that?

144
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:38,963
Did you know about it?

145
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,233
No way.

146
00:11:43,393 --> 00:11:45,402
Is it because the building is old?

147
00:11:45,403 --> 00:11:48,203
Don't say that my house is old or whatnot. It's annoying.

148
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:50,343
You're right. Sorry.

149
00:11:51,803 --> 00:11:52,803
Go home.

150
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:55,373
Something is off about you.

151
00:11:55,743 --> 00:11:57,083
You even called me.

152
00:11:58,743 --> 00:12:01,183
By the way, what's that? That big bag.

153
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:05,653
Mind your own business.

154
00:12:07,223 --> 00:12:08,723
- Go home.
- Okay.

155
00:12:19,203 --> 00:12:20,303
Mom!

156
00:12:28,113 --> 00:12:29,173
Hey.

157
00:12:29,673 --> 00:12:31,783
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

158
00:12:32,413 --> 00:12:35,413
Noh Se. Clean it up. Hurry.

159
00:12:36,853 --> 00:12:38,752
- Let's clean it.
- Hey, get that trash.

160
00:12:38,753 --> 00:12:40,893
- Get the trash. Come on.
- Okay.

161
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:46,163
You jerk!

162
00:12:46,423 --> 00:12:47,933
I told you...

163
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,262
- we shouldn't do it, scumbag.
- Okay.

164
00:12:50,263 --> 00:12:52,003
- I get it.
- Punk.

165
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,133
I've come to my senses.

166
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,132
Hurry.

167
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:57,003
Seriously, you're a jerk.

168
00:13:02,713 --> 00:13:03,983
That was dangerous.

169
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:05,742
- One, two.
- One, two.

170
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:09,013
- Let's go, Candidate Two!
- Let's go, Candidate Two!

171
00:13:09,313 --> 00:13:10,423
Great work.

172
00:13:12,653 --> 00:13:14,493
- Be careful. You'll fall.
- I'll be fine.

173
00:13:15,623 --> 00:13:16,722
- Don't do it.
- Stop.

174
00:13:16,723 --> 00:13:18,922
- Two, three.
- Two, three.

175
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:19,993
One more time.

176
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,402
- Two, three, four, five, six.
- Two, three, four, five, six.

177
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:27,233
- Candidate Two, Yang Won Dae.
- Candidate Two, Yang Won Dae.

178
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:28,832
- Stay on beat.
- Don't hit me.

179
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,272
- Yang Won Dae brings change.
- Not bad.

180
00:13:30,273 --> 00:13:32,303
- Mind your own business.
- Mind your own business.

181
00:13:32,473 --> 00:13:34,312
- Mind your own business.
- Go away.

182
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,473
Candidate One,

183
00:13:36,173 --> 00:13:37,912
- let's do this!
- let's do this!

184
00:13:37,913 --> 00:13:39,383
- Like this.
- Like this? Okay.

Hey. I saw Nam Gyeong Tae and Oh Dae Hee...

188
00:13:45,523 --> 00:13:48,293
arguing in front of the stationery store yesterday.

189
00:13:48,423 --> 00:13:49,853
Because of that conscience declaration.

190
00:13:49,953 --> 00:13:50,963
Is that so?

191
00:13:51,393 --> 00:13:53,122
Is there going to be a fistfight soon?

192
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,563
A fistfight, my foot.

193
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,533
They shook hands in the end.

194
00:13:56,763 --> 00:13:58,703
Those boring punks.

195
00:13:59,003 --> 00:14:00,903
And you were just watching them?

196
00:14:01,673 --> 00:14:02,903
You must have a lot of free time.

197
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:06,003
Seriously? Then what were you doing last night, Chief of Security?

198
00:14:06,243 --> 00:14:07,373
You were nowhere to be seen.

199

329

330

364
00:21:06,623 --> 00:21:10,132
- Ha Yu Gyeong!
- Ha Yu Gyeong!

365
00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:12,502
Hi, everyone. This is YJBS.

366
00:21:12,503 --> 00:21:14,302
I'm currently at Youngjin High School's...

367
00:21:14,303 --> 00:21:16,102
student council election campaign site.

368
00:21:16,103 --> 00:21:20,072
Right before me is Student Council President Candidate One,

369
00:21:20,073 --> 00:21:22,743
Kwak Sang Hyeon. Let's have a quick interview.

370
00:21:22,943 --> 00:21:24,212
Hi, Candidate Kwak Sang Hyeon.

371
00:21:24,213 --> 00:21:26,412
Please tell us the advantages there would be...

372
00:21:26,413 --> 00:21:28,513
if Candidate One became the student council president.

373
00:21:28,683 --> 00:21:31,682
Above everything else, students are...

374
00:21:31,683 --> 00:21:34,552
Hi, there. You met Candidate One just now.

375
00:21:34,553 --> 00:21:35,922
Don't you want to meet Candidate Two?

376
00:21:35,923 --> 00:21:37,792
- How about we go meet him now?
- Hey!

377
00:21:37,793 --> 00:21:40,023
Come this way. Come on.

378
00:21:41,193 --> 00:21:43,662
Candidate Two, Yang Won Dae. I wonder where he is.

379
00:21:43,663 --> 00:21:45,632
There he is! Here's Candidate Yang Won Dae.

380
00:21:45,633 --> 00:21:47,972
- Candidate Two!
- Now then,

381
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,672
let's hear from Candidate Two, Yang Won Dae.

382
00:21:50,673 --> 00:21:52,572
What are your key campaign pledges?

383
00:21:52,573 --> 00:21:54,442
We will bring back the National Sports Festival...

384
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:56,243
and school trips for all students.

385
00:21:56,873 --> 00:21:59,012
- Candidate 2! Let's do this!
- Candidate 2!

386
00:21:59,013 --> 00:22:00,812
All right. Reviving the school trip.

387
00:22:00,813 --> 00:22:03,683
That was Candidate Two's main pledge.

388
00:22:05,683 --> 00:22:07,823
The candidate involved in the drinking party...

389
00:22:08,423 --> 00:22:10,822
should step down voluntarily!

390
00:22:10,823 --> 00:22:12,723
- What the heck?
- A high school student...

391
00:22:13,093 --> 00:22:14,833
should not host any drinking party!

392
00:22:15,363 --> 00:22:16,593
- What's going on?
- What?

393
00:22:16,633 --> 00:22:18,563
The candidate involved in the drinking party...

394
00:22:19,103 --> 00:22:21,032
- should step down voluntarily!
- Who is he talking about?

395
00:22:21,033 --> 00:22:22,602
- Let's go and get ready.
- Hey!

396
00:22:22,603 --> 00:22:23,803
- Get down!
- Election Commission!

397
00:22:24,773 --> 00:22:26,043
(The drinking party candidate)

398
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,542
Nam Gyeong Tae!

399
00:22:27,543 --> 00:22:30,012
(The whole student condemns. Step down, Kwak Sang Hyeon!)

400
00:22:30,013 --> 00:22:31,842
- Nam Gyeong Tae, that little...
- Here's the ugly truth...

401
00:22:31,843 --> 00:22:33,713
- Stay still. Ignore him.
- behind...

402
00:22:33,783 --> 00:22:35,882
- Candidate One Kwak Sang Hyeon!
- Shut it!

403
00:22:35,883 --> 00:22:37,312
- Won Dae, he's...
- We...

404
00:22:37,313 --> 00:22:38,383
- Stay still.
- know everything!

405
00:22:39,623 --> 00:22:41,353
The candidate involved in the drinking party,

406
00:22:42,053 --> 00:22:44,593
- Kwak Sang Hyeon, and the rest, - It's dangerous!

407
00:22:45,593 --> 00:22:47,663
Should step down voluntarily!

408
00:22:48,693 --> 00:22:50,293
A high school student hosting a drinking party?

409
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:52,203
Step down voluntarily!

410
00:22:53,463 --> 00:22:55,303
Corrupt Kwak Sang Hyeon should...

411
00:22:55,573 --> 00:22:57,673
Nam Gyeong Tae! What do you think you're doing?

412
00:22:58,003 --> 00:22:59,642
- Enough!
- step down voluntarily!

413
00:22:59,643 --> 00:23:00,673
Stop it!

414
00:23:00,743 --> 00:23:02,373
- The drinking party candidate...
- Come here.

415
00:23:02,543 --> 00:23:03,773
- should step down voluntarily!
- Come.

416
00:23:06,283 --> 00:23:08,652
- Catch him!
- The drinking party candidate...

417
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:09,783
- Hey!
- Come on!

418
00:23:09,953 --> 00:23:11,982
- What are you doing?
- The drinking party candidate...

419
00:23:11,983 --> 00:23:13,623
should step down...

420
00:23:16,093 --> 00:23:19,362
- The drinking party candidate...
- Stop it!

421
00:23:19,363 --> 00:23:20,392
- should step down voluntarily!
- Unbelievable.

422
00:23:20,393 --> 00:23:22,432
- Seriously.
- It's dangerous.

423
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:25,002
- Step down, Noh Se Hoon!
- Don't lose him.

424
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:27,672
- The drinking party candidate...
- What is wrong with him?

425
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:28,772
- He's getting kicked out.
- Noh Se!

426
00:23:28,773 --> 00:23:30,703
- Wake up, will you?
- Stop it.

427
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:32,002
That punk.

428
00:23:32,003 --> 00:23:33,003
What was he thinking?

429
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:40,912
- What is it?
- Is it a group message?

430
00:23:40,913 --> 00:23:41,983
Who sent it?

431
00:23:42,013 --> 00:23:43,013
- What?
- For real?

432
00:23:43,313 --> 00:23:45,023
- The candidate...
- What?

433
00:23:46,453 --> 00:23:47,993
- A drinking party scandal?
- Drinking party?

434
00:23:48,123 --> 00:23:49,623
- This is wrong.
- Did he drink?

435
00:23:49,823 --> 00:23:51,823
A high schooler holding a drinking party?

436
00:23:52,123 --> 00:23:53,922
Gosh, and it was on his birthday.

437
00:23:53,923 --> 00:23:55,463
You have to be kidding me!

438
00:23:55,733 --> 00:23:57,803
- Step down!
- Is this for real?

439
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,842
Sang Hyeon. Why didn't you invite us?

440
00:24:05,843 --> 00:24:07,103
This is so wrong.

441
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:12,983
Set down!

442
00:24:12,983 --> 00:24:13,983
Hey, Noh Se Hoon!

443
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,512
(Shocking: Camp One's ugly drinking party scandal)

444
00:24:16,513 --> 00:24:18,552
Allegations have surfaced that Student President Candidate...

445
00:24:18,553 --> 00:24:20,992
Kwak Sang Hyeon, Vice President Noh Se Hoon,

446
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:22,923
Yoon Jeong Hui, and other members...

447
00:24:23,223 --> 00:24:25,262
of Camp One held a secret drinking party...

448
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:26,393
at an undisclosed place.

449
00:24:29,963 --> 00:24:31,633
Youngjin High's students...

450
00:24:32,463 --> 00:24:34,033
need to make a firm decision...

451
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:36,033
for the future of our school.

452
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:40,843
(Live Support Ratings: Kwak Sang Hyeon versus Yang Won Dae)

453
00:24:41,543 --> 00:24:43,473
Today was the fourth election rally.

454
00:24:43,843 --> 00:24:45,942
In an intense showdown...

455
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:48,013
between the female candidates,

456
00:24:48,413 --> 00:24:50,382
Yoon Jeong Hui beat Ha Yu Gyeong...

457
00:24:50,383 --> 00:24:52,053
by a margin with a strong speech.

458
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:55,523
However, allegations of a drinking party involving...

459
00:24:55,753 --> 00:24:58,022
candidate Kwak Sang Hyeon surfaced, throwing voters into confusion.

460
00:24:58,023 --> 00:25:00,162
(Who is the election for? Candidates make their final push.)

461
00:25:00,163 --> 00:25:01,733
With the election just one day away,

462
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:04,903
YJBS will be with the voters.

463
00:25:09,233 --> 00:25:10,273
Have you all lost it?

464
00:25:10,603 --> 00:25:12,703
How can you do this when you're running for election?

465
00:25:13,043 --> 00:25:15,813
In Gyeong. It doesn't seem like they have evidence.

466
00:25:16,013 --> 00:25:17,543
Can't we just ignore it?

467
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:18,783
Evidence?

468
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,183
This is the evidence.

469
00:25:23,713 --> 00:25:25,683
The allegation alone is the evidence.

470
00:25:26,953 --> 00:25:28,823
Things will spiral out of control now.

471
00:25:32,123 --> 00:25:34,762
- Guys.
- We don't believe in fake news.

472
00:25:34,763 --> 00:25:35,763
Hey!

473
00:25:36,133 --> 00:25:37,633
Didn't we tell you to wait?

474
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:40,933
- And can't you read the mood?
- Seriously.

475
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:44,102
Stay strong

476
00:25:44,103 --> 00:25:45,842
- Stay strong - Stay strong

477
00:25:45,843 --> 00:25:46,843
We're screwed.

478
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:52,683
Kwak Sang Hyeon.

479
00:25:53,613 --> 00:25:54,653
What are you going to do?

480
00:25:57,513 --> 00:25:58,583
Hey.

481
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:02,423
How boring.

482
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:12,863
It's not like...

483
00:26:13,803 --> 00:26:16,603
I killed or scammed someone.

484
00:26:18,003 --> 00:26:19,673
- What?
- Look.

485
00:26:21,573 --> 00:26:23,312
Kids can have a drink or two...

486
00:26:23,313 --> 00:26:24,913
and smoke a cigarette, no?

487
00:26:25,843 --> 00:26:26,843
Is that such a huge deal?

488
00:26:27,713 --> 00:26:29,153
Either way, they don't have evidence.

489
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:30,813
Stop overreacting, will you?

490
00:26:31,283 --> 00:26:32,353
Watch your tone.

491
00:26:32,853 --> 00:26:33,853
You're really crossing the line.

492
00:26:33,854 --> 00:26:35,153
I'm the one taking responsibility.

493
00:26:35,723 --> 00:26:37,293
Forget it all. Just ignore it.

494
00:26:38,823 --> 00:26:41,563
Tell everyone that message is a load of bull. Got it?

495
00:26:42,633 --> 00:26:45,303
Didn't we take all the phones that day, Wan Sik?

496
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:48,873
And you.

497
00:26:51,203 --> 00:26:52,203
Yes?

498
00:26:52,603 --> 00:26:54,813
Stop reacting in front of the others.

499
00:26:59,813 --> 00:27:00,813
Understood.

500
00:27:03,983 --> 00:27:05,023
Get on with it.

501
00:27:05,853 --> 00:27:07,353
Or are you going to sit around and do nothing?

502
00:27:09,553 --> 00:27:10,723
Watch your face, will you?

503
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:13,923
Guys. Let's go.

504
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:15,993
And keep a straight face.

505
00:27:17,433 --> 00:27:18,433
Let's go.

506
00:27:45,523 --> 00:27:48,463
In the last election,

507
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:51,863
do you know why you lost?

508
00:27:52,763 --> 00:27:53,803
What was that?

509
00:27:57,703 --> 00:27:58,803
Kids...

510
00:28:00,573 --> 00:28:02,143
don't vote for the predictable.

511
00:28:02,943 --> 00:28:04,543
They vote for winners.

512
00:28:05,883 --> 00:28:07,113
What are you on about?

513
00:28:08,513 --> 00:28:10,113
I'm going to win.

514
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:13,883
If you're going to do it, do it properly.

515
00:28:14,953 --> 00:28:16,493
And stop with the nagging.

516
00:28:19,523 --> 00:28:21,692
- Hi, we're Candidate 1.
- Hi, we're Candidate 1.

517
00:28:21,693 --> 00:28:22,793
Hey, drinking party!

518
00:28:22,963 --> 00:28:24,533
- Did you not step down yet?
- Are you okay?

519
00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:26,962
I heard it was at KwakKwaki's summer house on Jeju Island.

520
00:28:26,963 --> 00:28:28,672
Did you drink...

521
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:29,932
- Step down!
- all the way on Jeju Island?

522
00:28:29,933 --> 00:28:33,243
Someone like us can't even afford to go to the movies with a friend.

523
00:28:33,673 --> 00:28:35,673
But to fly to Jeju Island during the semester?

524
00:28:35,873 --> 00:28:37,982
Man, the sense of deprivation is real.

525
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:40,083
Don't talk like that when you don't know a thing.

526
00:28:40,313 --> 00:28:42,582
Rumour has it you drank and played the King's Game...

527
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:44,013
at the Jeju Island summer house.

528
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:47,652
Have Kwak Sang Hyeon come here too.

529
00:28:47,653 --> 00:28:49,153
Why did he only send you guys?

530
00:28:49,393 --> 00:28:52,063
- Sang Hyeon is visiting...
- You tell us.

531
00:28:52,563 --> 00:28:55,093
Did you play King's Game after drinking or not?

532
00:28:56,263 --> 00:28:59,763
I've never been to Jeju Island in my life.

533
00:29:00,403 --> 00:29:02,932
So the question about playing King's Game there...

534
00:29:02,933 --> 00:29:04,772
- and such is invalid.
- He's right.

535
00:29:04,773 --> 00:29:06,742
Invalid, my foot!

536
00:29:06,743 --> 00:29:10,572
Then show us your passport. Show it to us!

537
00:29:10,573 --> 00:29:13,713
- Your pass...
- Stop spouting nonsense already!

538
00:29:17,153 --> 00:29:18,523
Honestly,

539
00:29:19,053 --> 00:29:21,953
I did have a sip of makgeolli during Chuseok. But that was it.

540
00:29:24,323 --> 00:29:25,593
Have you never done that?

541
00:29:26,563 --> 00:29:27,563
Not even once?

542
00:29:29,163 --> 00:29:30,393
So it was on Chuseok.

543
00:29:30,763 --> 00:29:33,002
- We finally get the picture.
- I know, right?

544
00:29:33,003 --> 00:29:34,362
They went to Jeju Island on Chuseok,

545
00:29:34,363 --> 00:29:36,472
had makgeolli, and played the King's Game.

546
00:29:36,473 --> 00:29:37,602
- Right?
- She's rotten to the core!

547
00:29:37,603 --> 00:29:39,442
How can she be the vice president? Right, guys?

548
00:29:39,443 --> 00:29:40,443
- Yes.
- You.

549
00:29:40,444 --> 00:29:42,442
You don't even care about school issues, do you?

550
00:29:42,443 --> 00:29:44,343
You just want to get into a good university, no?

551
00:29:44,843 --> 00:29:46,283
Just step down, Yoon Jeong Hui.

552
00:29:46,543 --> 00:29:47,812
Step down!

553
00:29:47,813 --> 00:29:48,853
"Step down?"

554
00:29:53,923 --> 00:29:55,153
If you're right,

555
00:29:56,693 --> 00:29:58,892
I'll take responsibility and quit school.

556
00:29:58,893 --> 00:29:59,893
Happy now?

557
00:29:59,894 --> 00:30:01,092
She'll quit school.

558
00:30:01,093 --> 00:30:02,332
- Maybe it's false.
- She's overreacting.

559
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,702
- Is it not true?
- Why are you overreacting?

560
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:05,963
Whatever if it's not true.

561
00:30:06,633 --> 00:30:07,633
And you.

562
00:30:09,773 --> 00:30:10,973
Who needs...

563
00:30:11,673 --> 00:30:13,243
a passport to go to Jeju Island?

564
00:30:16,713 --> 00:30:18,613
- Burn!
- I'll be back with a passport.

565
00:30:18,843 --> 00:30:19,883
Let's go.

566
00:30:23,653 --> 00:30:25,523
You think I made Gyeong Tae do it?

567
00:30:28,753 --> 00:30:29,823
Jun.

568
00:30:30,623 --> 00:30:33,593
Isn't it best to focus on your job?

569
00:30:34,323 --> 00:30:35,393
That's true.

570
00:30:36,563 --> 00:30:38,103
But taking it this way is a bit...

571
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:40,533
And the vibe at school is off.

572
00:30:41,933 --> 00:30:44,273
It's okay. This is natural.

573
00:30:44,773 --> 00:30:46,273
Our school elections have always been intense.

574
00:30:48,243 --> 00:30:50,973
I'm not too sure if this is right.

575
00:30:54,883 --> 00:30:56,113
Of course, this is right.

576
00:30:56,783 --> 00:30:58,353
And the others deserve to know too.

577
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,023
It's like...

578
00:31:01,023 --> 00:31:02,823
their right to know.

579
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:06,163
"Right to know?"

580
00:31:07,493 --> 00:31:08,563
Yes.

581
00:31:09,093 --> 00:31:11,033
A candidate holding a drinking party at home.

582
00:31:11,463 --> 00:31:12,563
It's not normal, is it?

583
00:31:19,203 --> 00:31:21,543
It's okay. Don't doubt it.

584
00:31:23,413 --> 00:31:25,713
Don't doubt a thing. Okay, Jun?

585
00:31:34,023 --> 00:31:35,593
Just so you know,

586
00:31:37,293 --> 00:31:38,723
I didn't say anything.

587
00:31:39,693 --> 00:31:40,693
About what?

588
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:44,463
That night. What you told me at the drinking party.

589
00:31:45,233 --> 00:31:48,273
You... Why are you bringing that up out of the blue?

590
00:31:49,703 --> 00:31:53,303
I'm just telling you not to worry about our conversation.

591
00:31:54,303 --> 00:31:55,573
Are you blackmailing me right now?

592
00:32:00,213 --> 00:32:01,243
It's boring.

593
00:32:02,313 --> 00:32:03,383
What is?

594
00:32:04,453 --> 00:32:06,223
The election. It's boring.

595
00:32:08,853 --> 00:32:10,453
If I could go back to the beginning.

596
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:14,622
Back to when Ha Yu Gyeong asked me...

597
00:32:14,623 --> 00:32:15,633
to run the election with her.

598
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:19,903
Gosh, I'd turn her down flat.

599
00:32:20,533 --> 00:32:21,633
No way I'd do it.

600
00:32:23,033 --> 00:32:24,373
Why did you say yes back then?

601
00:32:28,443 --> 00:32:29,513
I thought it'd be fun.

602
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:32,613
You're a psycho.

603
00:32:44,553 --> 00:32:47,293
Once it's over, let's grab fried chicken together.

604
00:32:48,263 --> 00:32:49,263
Sure, whatever.

605
00:32:59,543 --> 00:33:00,743
- Hey. See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

606
00:33:01,343 --> 00:33:02,343
Was it all planned out?

607
00:33:02,713 --> 00:33:03,943
It'd be so wrong if it were.

608
00:33:04,213 --> 00:33:05,213
Guys.

609
00:33:05,643 --> 00:33:06,982
Mr. Sin says there's no afternoon homeroom.

610
00:33:06,983 --> 00:33:07,983
Nice!

611
00:33:07,984 --> 00:33:09,782
- Fake news.
- Yes!

612
00:33:09,783 --> 00:33:12,353
Fake news. Go home.

613
00:33:14,853 --> 00:33:16,022
We're going home first.

614
00:33:16,023 --> 00:33:17,122
- Wait for me.
- I'll get in touch.

615
00:33:17,123 --> 00:33:18,322
- I'm off.
- Okay.

616
00:33:18,323 --> 00:33:20,023
- Bye.
- See you tomorrow.

617
00:33:20,593 --> 00:33:22,192
- See you tomorrow.
- Gosh.

618
00:33:22,193 --> 00:33:23,193
I'm leaving.

619
00:33:24,633 --> 00:33:25,932
(Candidate 2, Yang Won Dae)

620
00:33:25,933 --> 00:33:28,003
Really. Nam Gyeong Tae is a real wacko.

621
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:31,573
Why is he risking his life in the election?

622
00:33:33,173 --> 00:33:34,203
I have no idea.

623
00:33:34,743 --> 00:33:36,343
He should do it in moderation.

624
00:33:36,773 --> 00:33:37,873
Are you guys okay?

625
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:39,883
It'll be over by tomorrow.

626
00:33:44,283 --> 00:33:45,323
I'm going home first.

627
00:33:45,553 --> 00:33:46,623
Bye.

628
00:33:46,783 --> 00:33:47,983
- Bye.
- Bye.

629
00:33:53,923 --> 00:33:55,693
Hey. Be honest with us.

630
00:33:56,133 --> 00:33:57,493
We won't tell a soul.

631
00:33:57,763 --> 00:33:59,132
I never went to Jeju Island.

632
00:33:59,133 --> 00:34:00,232
But still,

633
00:34:00,233 --> 00:34:02,433
Jeju Island or not, was there actually a drinking party?

634
00:34:02,733 --> 00:34:04,002
I'm just curious.

635
00:34:04,003 --> 00:34:05,303
Enough, will you?

636
00:34:05,573 --> 00:34:07,642
What you're doing will only spread the fake news.

637
00:34:07,643 --> 00:34:08,643
Zip it.

638
00:34:08,973 --> 00:34:09,973
Noh Se!

639
00:34:11,013 --> 00:34:12,743
Camp Two is totally screwed.

640
00:34:12,883 --> 00:34:14,913
What is it this time? A sex party?

641
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,153
Are you mad?

642
00:34:16,183 --> 00:34:17,813
The anonymous community board has gone wild.

643
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,223
Why?

644
00:34:19,253 --> 00:34:21,353
Park Ji Hun fabricated report cards and sold them to others,

645
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:22,853
including guys from other schools.

646
00:34:23,253 --> 00:34:24,962
That was posted on our school community board?

647
00:34:24,963 --> 00:34:27,223
"The nasty true colours of Candidate Two."

648
00:34:28,093 --> 00:34:30,432
- "Park Ji Hun." - "Fabricated report cards."

649
00:34:30,433 --> 00:34:31,433
"A whistleblower."

650
00:34:32,263 --> 00:34:33,333
"Testimony?"

651
00:34:40,443 --> 00:34:42,712
Is it true that Park Ji Hun fabricated the report cards?

652
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:43,713
I bet it's true.

653
00:34:44,143 --> 00:34:45,143
What?

654
00:34:47,113 --> 00:34:48,653
Wait. Isn't that Se Hoon?

655
00:34:48,983 --> 00:34:50,353
Yes. Why is he here?

656
00:34:50,853 --> 00:34:51,952
What's with him?

657
00:34:51,953 --> 00:34:55,322
(Park Ji Hun)

658
00:34:55,323 --> 00:34:58,193

00:35:05,563 --> 00:35:08,802
(Park Ji Hun from Grade 1 Class 4 Fabricated Report Cards, )

662
00:35:08,803 --> 00:35:13,072
(Attached Testimony from Whistleblower)

663
00:35:13,073 --> 00:35:14,673
He sold it for money or gift cards.

664
00:35:15,043 --> 00:35:16,812
He charged five dollars for every subject...

665
00:35:16,813 --> 00:35:19,412
and even had the whole thing saved as a Word file.

666
00:35:19,413 --> 00:35:22,613
If you ask to change 10 subjects, it'll be 50 dollars, right?

667
00:35:23,183 --> 00:35:24,583
Probably.

668
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:28,223
But can it be modified so easily?

669
00:35:29,323 --> 00:35:31,453
Honestly, I don't know much about it.

670
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:32,923
He must have his own method.

671
00:35:34,123 --> 00:35:36,693
But what were the students who bought those report cards...

672
00:35:36,793 --> 00:35:38,703
planning to do with them?

673
00:35:39,733 --> 00:35:42,503
Most of them were to fool their parents.

674
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:44,532
Although they'd get busted later on.

675
00:35:44,533 --> 00:35:46,043
I see.

676
00:35:46,503 --> 00:35:49,073
Gosh, so it's not anything serious.

677
00:35:49,643 --> 00:35:50,713
Anyway, got it.

678
00:35:52,883 --> 00:35:54,013
By the way, In Gyeong.

679
00:35:54,683 --> 00:35:56,213
Was this conversation necessary?

680
00:35:57,883 --> 00:35:59,852
I was just curious.

681
00:35:59,853 --> 00:36:01,083
Right.

682
00:36:03,123 --> 00:36:06,092
But don't tell me you bought report cards...

683
00:36:06,093 --> 00:36:08,063
from him or something.

684
00:36:08,593 --> 00:36:11,263
Gosh, no. I would never.

685
00:36:11,863 --> 00:36:14,833
Right? There's no way you'd do that.

686
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:18,973
But what if word gets out about this?

687
00:36:20,773 --> 00:36:21,773
(Live Support Ratings: Kwak Sang Hyeon versus Yang Won Dae)

688
00:36:21,774 --> 00:36:23,472

690
00:36:25,113 --> 00:36:26,583
That'll be his problem.

691
00:36:27,713 --> 00:36:30,783
He didn't seem all that normal from the start.

692
00:36:33,053 --> 00:36:34,993
I'll look into it tomorrow and report it to you.

693
00:36:36,493 --> 00:36:37,493
Sang Hyeon!

694
00:36:40,023 --> 00:36:42,393
What brought you here? I told you to get some rest today.

695
00:36:44,563 --> 00:36:47,163
Why didn't you answer my calls? I kept calling you nonstop.

696
00:36:50,133 --> 00:36:52,243
My phone was on mute. What's wrong?

697
00:36:55,673 --> 00:36:57,742
My chat with In Gyeong about Ji Hun is...

698
00:36:57,743 --> 00:36:59,183
on the school's anonymous board.

699
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:01,853
Really?

700
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:03,653
What was it about again?

701
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:04,813
Don't play innocent!

702
00:37:05,453 --> 00:37:07,453
You know everything, don't you? Aren't you behind this?

703
00:37:07,553 --> 00:37:08,553
Se Hoon.

704
00:37:09,353 --> 00:37:10,392
You're crossing the line.

705
00:37:10,393 --> 00:37:12,623
I had no idea a video was being taken back then.

706
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:14,662
And everything I said was pieced together...

707
00:37:14,663 --> 00:37:16,933
to sound completely messed up, darn it!

708
00:37:19,433 --> 00:37:20,833
Shut it, will you?

709
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:22,333
Lower your voice.

710
00:37:27,243 --> 00:37:29,873
We've been in crisis all morning because of Nam Gyeong Tae.

711
00:37:31,313 --> 00:37:32,343
If we go down right now?

712
00:37:33,783 --> 00:37:35,552
Everything they said would become true.

713
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:36,553
Do you get it?

714
00:37:36,853 --> 00:37:39,223
So you dug into Ji Hun all along for this, right?

715
00:37:39,483 --> 00:37:41,023
- By using me?
- Listen carefully.

716
00:37:42,953 --> 00:37:45,692
It was already set in stone from the moment Park Ji Hun became...

717
00:37:45,693 --> 00:37:47,193
Candidate Two for vice president.

718
00:37:47,563 --> 00:37:48,563
You know how it feels...

00:37:48,563 --> 00:37:49,563

And Ji Hun?

721
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:53,603
The same goes for him.

722
00:37:54,163 --> 00:37:55,732
If he wanted to stay friends with you,

723
00:37:55,733 --> 00:37:57,433
he shouldn't have run in the first place.

724
00:38:01,273 --> 00:38:02,273
That video?

725
00:38:03,543 --> 00:38:04,613
I heard it too.

726
00:38:05,443 --> 00:38:06,513
But your voice was altered.

727
00:38:07,413 --> 00:38:08,953
How would anyone know it was you?

728
00:38:10,553 --> 00:38:11,583
Just ignore it.

729
00:38:12,753 --> 00:38:13,823
Ignore it, okay?

730
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:17,023
Se Hoon.

731
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:20,093
The election is just a day away.

732
00:38:21,093 --> 00:38:24,032
You should solely focus on...

733
00:38:24,033 --> 00:38:25,133
how we can win.

734
00:38:27,463 --> 00:38:28,733
We must win no matter what.

735
00:38:30,403 --> 00:38:32,603
Only then will what we say become the truth.

736
00:38:37,313 --> 00:38:38,383
Once we win,

737
00:38:38,913 --> 00:38:41,013
I promise to settle the matter with Ji Hun.

738
00:38:41,913 --> 00:38:42,983
You trust me, right?

739
00:38:55,863 --> 00:38:57,832
(Chicken Ji Hun)

740
00:38:57,833 --> 00:38:59,632
(Where are you, Chicken Ji Hun?)

741
00:38:59,633 --> 00:39:01,363
(Answer my calls.)

742
00:39:08,473 --> 00:39:09,473
Hey.

743
00:39:10,943 --> 00:39:12,713
What? Won Dae.

744
00:39:13,813 --> 00:39:14,983
Why are you here?

745
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:17,083
To meet Ji Hun?

746
00:39:17,913 --> 00:39:18,923
Yes.

747
00:39:19,183 --> 00:39:20,883
How is Ji Hun doing?

748
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:23,523
Noh Se Hoon.

749
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:25,663
Yes?

750
00:39:28,563 --> 00:39:30,433
You really are a lost cause.

751
00:39:31,433 --> 00:39:32,433
Sorry?

752
00:39:32,434 --> 00:39:34,333
It's your voice on the school community board, right?

753
00:39:34,733 --> 00:39:35,833
Did you think the modulation could fool us?

754
00:39:36,403 --> 00:39:38,302
No. It's not me.

755
00:39:38,303 --> 00:39:39,673
Stop lying.

756
00:39:40,943 --> 00:39:42,513
Honestly, I've been keeping my cool.

757
00:39:43,073 --> 00:39:45,713
Even when you stabbed me in the back.

758
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:48,312
But now, you're even betraying your friend?

759
00:39:48,313 --> 00:39:50,253
- It wasn't me, okay?
- Seriously, you jerk?

760
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:52,083
Darn it.

761
00:39:57,393 --> 00:39:59,093
To be frank, I met...

762
00:39:59,693 --> 00:40:01,563
with other candidates before you in this selection.

763
00:40:02,193 --> 00:40:05,163
And I thought you were a decent guy.

764
00:40:06,503 --> 00:40:08,463
Knowing how close you and Ji Hun were...

765
00:40:09,033 --> 00:40:10,403
gave me a headache.

766
00:40:11,373 --> 00:40:12,443
But...

767
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:14,103
Do you know what Ji Hun said?

768
00:40:15,873 --> 00:40:17,643
He said Noh Se would understand.

769
00:40:18,683 --> 00:40:19,713
Why?

770
00:40:20,513 --> 00:40:21,853
Because you're dead kind.

771
00:40:24,853 --> 00:40:26,523
He said you were dead kind.

772
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:28,693
Isn't it hilarious even for you?

773
00:40:32,923 --> 00:40:35,093
This is where guys like you end.

774
00:40:44,273 --> 00:40:46,003
I don't know whose account it is,

775
00:40:46,373 --> 00:40:47,973
but it was posted a few minutes ago.

776
00:40:49,443 --> 00:40:50,813
They look like screenshots from a video...

777
00:40:51,673 --> 00:40:52,983
rather than photos.

778
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:56,213
This darn jerk.

779
00:40:56,813 --> 00:40:58,823
My guess is they intentionally recorded it in secret.

780
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:01,553
- How annoying.
- Kang Jae Won.

781
00:41:03,453 --> 00:41:04,993
What were you doing with Wan Sik?

782
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,463
Couldn't you have monitored the phones better?

783
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:12,503
Who knew they'd do that?

784
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,133
And they were invitees.

785
00:41:16,533 --> 00:41:17,933
You don't know whose account it is?

786
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:21,003
No. I think the account was made just for this.

787
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:24,143
These are the only posts.

788
00:41:26,713 --> 00:41:27,713
Darn it.

789
00:41:28,683 --> 00:41:29,783
There are no followers, right?

790
00:41:30,153 --> 00:41:31,313
Aren't we okay then?

791
00:41:32,683 --> 00:41:33,683
Hey.

792
00:41:35,153 --> 00:41:37,022
Leaving his name in the hashtag...

793
00:41:37,023 --> 00:41:38,093
is the problem here.

794
00:41:38,553 --> 00:41:39,663
Are you kidding me?

795
00:41:41,663 --> 00:41:43,433
It's a matter of time before this spreads.

796
00:41:44,163 --> 00:41:47,033
We need to find the account owner and delete everything fast.

797
00:41:47,733 --> 00:41:48,773
You know that, don't you?

798
00:41:57,073 --> 00:41:59,243
Aren't there pros who track down stuff like this?

799
00:42:00,113 --> 00:42:02,212
The guy who hacked Mi Na's Instagram account...

800
00:42:02,213 --> 00:42:03,383
was caught pretty fast.

801
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:06,723
I remember.

802
00:42:08,523 --> 00:42:10,453
Okay. I'll ask around.

803
00:42:14,663 --> 00:42:15,663
Hey, give me a cigarette.

804
00:42:28,943 --> 00:42:29,973
I finished it earlier.

805
00:42:41,253 --> 00:42:42,323
I'll go buy one.

806
00:42:47,563 --> 00:42:49,663
Darn it. Hyeon Jin.

807
00:42:50,793 --> 00:42:52,163
Listen.

808
00:42:53,503 --> 00:42:56,133
If Yang Won Dae's camp gets their hands on this, we're done for.

809
00:46:29,113 --> 00:46:36,523
(I Am A Running Mate)
