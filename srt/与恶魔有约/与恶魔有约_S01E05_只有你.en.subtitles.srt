1
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:47,172
You bastard.

2
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,674
I finally got you.

3
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,968
Say hi to the boss for me.

4
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:12,864
Jeong Gu-won.

5
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,450
Do Do-hee.

6
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,244
What do you want?

7
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:23,666
I'm…

8
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:28,296
my bodyguard's bodyguard!

9
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,008
Stay away.

10
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,595
Why is charging
always the problem for everything?

11
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,389
Stay away.

12
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,435
Get her!

13
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:44,979
Jeong Gu-won!

14
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:10,922
Do you know

15
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,466
how to tango?

16
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:14,801
Tango?

17
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,648
You must trust your partner
when you tango.

18
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,358
Why are you suddenly talking about tango?

19
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,442
Get him!

20
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,904
Behind you!

21
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:12,358
You morons,
why are you dancing all of a sudden?

22
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,818
Pull yourselves together!

23
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,904
What is this?!

24
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,865
"Rule number one for bodyguards."

25
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,825
"Never let her out of your sight."

26
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,453
"Rule number two."

27
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,829
"Never stray far from her."

28
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,086
"And rule number three."

29
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,881
"Never…

30
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,469
fall in love with her."

31
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,552
What's wrong?

32
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:23,972
Are you okay?

33
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,062
I made a report.

34
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,648
Let's get out of here first.

35
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,195
Jeong Gu-won!

36
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,462
Jeong Gu…

37
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,673
Jeong Gu-won!

38
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,929
The doors are closing.

39
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,343
What in the world…

40
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:03,571
EPISODE 5
ONLY YOU

41
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,865
SUNWOL FOUNDATION

42
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,122
What happened? Are you hurt?

43
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,042
Get the first aid kit!

44
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,503
-Let me see.
-Is someone trying to kill me?

45
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,713
Why is the sword so sharp?

46
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:21,798
What?

47
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,471
Star Jin, you're on another level indeed.

48
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,889
You were so in the zone

49
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:32,016
that you cut yourself
with this dull sword.

50
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,311
Thank you.

51
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,315
Manage the props better, will you?

52
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,691
Manage the props better!

53
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,193
There it is.

54
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,112
Forget it. I'll do it.

55
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,867
The show's just around the corner,
but Director Jeong couldn't care less.

56
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,870
But I'm here for you all the time.

57
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,872
-Isn't that enough?
-Of course not.

58
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:55,998
That makes sense.

59
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,044
Is there something going on
between him and Do Do-hee?

60
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,088
-What?
-He's still with her at work,

61
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,548
and they're always with each other.

62
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,757
Come on.

63
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,301
You know he has a heart of steel.

64
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,555
You've had eyes only for him
for over 20 years,

65
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:11,848
but he's never batted an eye--

66
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:12,974
Jeez.

67
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,019
Maybe he did bat an eye.

68
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,063
My point is,

69
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,524
his heart is as cold
as 200-year-old ice cream

70
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,152
that's been forgotten
at the bottom of a freezer.

71
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:27,196
It's frozen to the point
that it no longer functions properly.

72
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,366
He's not just good-looking
but unbelievably good-looking.

73
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,451
Yet for 200 years…

74
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:35,329
Yet for 200 years, he's been single.
There's a reason for that.

75
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,748
It's still bothering me.

76
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,501
I have a bad feeling about this girl.

77
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,838
Are there no other options
than him being her bodyguard?

78
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,842
That is our best option at the moment.

79
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,265
Don't you need a break?

80
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,559
This is nothing.

81
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,894
I'm short on time as it is.

82
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,022
Let's take it from the top.

83
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,909
Something's wrong with me.

84
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,871
Falling for a worthless human being?

85
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,458
Could it be…

86
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,462
because of the tattoo?

87
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:37,725
I mean…

88
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,478
Why would he look at me
with such contempt?

89
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,772
He was obsessed with holding my wrist.

90
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,274
Why is he suddenly acting
as if I were invisible?

91
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,901
Do I have to put up with this?

92
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,571
Was I the only one getting a vibe?

93
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,073
I bet he was too.

94
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,284
So why is he so cold all of a sudden?

95
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,619
Fiery one minute, cold the next.

96
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,955
What is he, a hot iced Americano?

97
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,666
I couldn't care less
whether he's hot or iced.

98
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,292
I'll just go my own way.

99
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,878
I've already been clingy enough.

100
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,051
SCHEDULED TOMORROW:
BLIND DATE

101
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,305
No, I must find out

102
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,933
whether he's hot or iced for me.

103
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,271
SUNWOL FOUNDATION

104
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,914
This is it.

105
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,793
I'll be clingy just one last time.

106
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,284
There's nothing wrong with me.

107
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,871
It's just a side effect
of losing my powers.

108
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,465
If he asks why I'm here,

109
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,925
I'll say that I was so curious

110
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,345
about the thugs from earlier
that I couldn't sleep.

111
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,972
I show up unannounced late at night.

112
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,516
He'll be happy to see me
if he has feelings for me.

113
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,311
If not, he'll be upset and annoyed.

114
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,730
It'll only take a second.

115
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,774
He can't fabricate the look in his eyes

116
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,317
the second he sees me.

117
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,653
Who are you?

118
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,239
What about you? Are you a thief?

119
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,242
I would say you're the one
who looks the part.

120
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,164
You don't look all that ordinary yourself.

121
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,338
Do Do-hee?

122
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,258
-You know me?
-You don't know me?

123
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,848
I can't believe
you don't recognize Star Jin.

124
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,724
Then I must be the star here.

125
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,977
Leave right now.

126
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,438
Outsiders aren't allowed in at this hour.

127
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,898
I'm not exactly an outsider,
so I refuse to leave.

128
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,693
I doubt it.

129
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,653
I have a special relationship
with the director here.

130
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,424
Jeong Gu-won?

131
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,224
The lights are on.

132
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,567
Where did he go?

133
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:07,119
He didn't seem like the academic type.

134
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,787
These must be just for show.

135
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,923
Does he collect vintage clocks as a hobby?

136
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,011
But why do they all look the same?

137
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,224
The numbers…

138
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,479
Nothing about him is ordinary, is it?

139
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,593
Who said you could go through my stuff?

140
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,307
Is that your diary or something?

141
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,433
Why so sensitive?

142
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:16,939
A cross?

143
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,070
Why, you pervert.

144
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,797
What?

145
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:42,965
Why are you half-naked?

146
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,385
Shouldn't you be rehearsing?

147
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:47,928
That's not what's…

148
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:52,808
Babe.

149
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,353
Didn't I tell you not to expose your skin
in front of other women?

150
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,899
-"Babe"?
-If you do this,

151
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:03,110
women will keep clinging to you
no matter how coldly you treat them.

152
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,738
Like fruit flies.

153
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,617
Cut it out and get back to rehearsing.

154
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,871
You always seem to act distant
when other people are around.

155
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:15,831
You're so cute.

156
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,208
Come down to the theater later.

157
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,585
I need to talk to you.

158
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,757
This is what you call

159
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,884
a "special relationship."

160
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,143
Who is she?

161
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:38,646
It's none of your business.

162
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,443
She and I almost killed
each other earlier.

163
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,946
I'd love to know
whose life I almost ended.

164
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,324
Did you show up here alone at this hour
to pry into my personal life?

165
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,868
No.

166
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,245
It's just

167
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,830
you took off so abruptly.

168
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,500
I was worried.

169
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,713
I just didn't want to be with you.

170
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,549
And yet here you are,

171
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,219
bothering me again.

172
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,391
Did I do something wrong?

173
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,434
-No.
-Then what's with the attitude?

174
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,895
I don't see why I should be nice to you.

175
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,108
Anything else you want to say?

176
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,404
I was clearly mistaken.

177
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,241
Sorry for bothering you.

178
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,791
Do Do-hee.

179
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,335
You couldn't have been more wrong.

180
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,643
Mr. Park, Do Do-hee is on her way out.

181
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,521
Make sure she gets home safe.

182
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:25,002
Check inside locker number 17.

183
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,008
You seem to be responding well
to the medication,

184
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,968
but let's keep monitoring your progress.

185
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,720
Nothing out of the ordinary, right?

186
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,432
It's not a big deal,

187
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,476
but I killed a person.

188
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,019
I see.

189
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,564
What?

190
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,108
Just checking if you're listening.

191
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,361
What a lunatic.

192
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,624
-Shall we?
-Sure.

193
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,878
I didn't know you could drink, Mr. Noh.

194
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,797
I can, but I've been holding back.

195
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,716
It must've been hard to hold back
in so many ways until now.

196
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:17,638
Thank you all for responding so quickly
regarding the audit team.

197
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:20,265
The company's stability
is our top priority.

198
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,519
On that note, we must soon fill the void
left behind by my mother.

199
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,730
I'll be counting on your help again.

200
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:30,317
Since the late chairwoman's will
was made public,

201
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,823
everyone seems to be welcoming
the youngest chairwoman in history.

202
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,283
So it's not as easy

203
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,035
to publicly support you.

204
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:46,250
Do-hee is like a little sister to me,
but I learn a lot from her.

205
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,253
She'd certainly set a good example.

206
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:50,671
But…

207
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:55,092
if we kept allowing anomalies like her,

208
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,971
the world would turn upside down.

209
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:02,099
The world is no longer an easy place.

210
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:05,519
Unfairness is the last thing
that people will tolerate.

211
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:08,105
Nepotism has become

212
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,815
such a taboo these days.

213
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:13,068
We can't do anything that wouldn't
sit well with the shareholders.

214
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,445
You don't seem to get my point.

215
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,115
Then let me spell it out.

216
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,659
You all recently received

217
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,911
a little something
from our subcontractor, right?

218
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:27,708
"The directors disbanded the audit team
formed under the chairwoman's last order

219
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,002
and accepted money from a subcontractor."

220
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:35,507
That may as well be a confession
to all your wrongdoings so far.

221
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,427
But you gave that order yourself.

222
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,428
Me?

223
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,850
You think a son
grieving his mother's passing

224
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,519
would do such a thing?

225
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,063
I didn't give or receive any money myself.

226
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,273
How will you prove it?

227
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:01,116
It was your greed
that led you astray, not me.

228
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:08,957
The world was never
an easy place to begin with.

229
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,462
You get trampled on and eaten up

230
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,797
without power.

231
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:21,511
There's only one way
the powerless can survive.

232
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,932
Siding with the most powerful.

233
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,267
Nothing else.

234
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:54,795
You're right.

235
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,838
I'm a lunatic.

236
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,161
About Mr. Cha.

237
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,914
How long did he work for you?

238
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:34,084
Almost two years
before he transferred to Mirae Group.

239
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,920
Did anything stand out during that time?

240
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:38,755
Not really.

241
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:44,177
How audacious of him
to pocket company funds.

242
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,679
It's not that he was audacious.

243
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,389
He was greedy.

244
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,768
You're actually right.

245
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,230
I'll go inside if you're done.

246
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:43,779
Why are you so surprised?

247
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,325
I didn't hear you come in.

248
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,077
What's Do-gyeong up to these days?

249
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,078
I don't know.

250
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,788
Nor do I want to.

251
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,502
Did you eat dinner?

252
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,170
Obviously.

253
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,235
It didn't come off.

254
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,073
CLOTHING BIN

255
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:43,672
Bravo!

256
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,509
Star Jin, you never disappoint.

257
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,427
Not even your injury could stop you.

258
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,595
That was amazing.

259
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,932
What do you think, Director Jeong?

260
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:00,730
It was good.

261
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,066
I kept making mistakes.

262
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:04,985
I even missed some beats.

263
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:07,612
Did you?

264
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:11,700
You finally found the time to be here,
but you can't seem to focus.

265
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:15,120
You're like an empty shell these days.

266
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:19,332
He does have an excellent-looking shell.
What more does he need?

267
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,960
So just stay on the beat.

268
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,837
Are you happy now? I'm off.

269
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:01,374
ENFORCER

270
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,793
ABRAXAS HAS ENTERED THE ROOM

271
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:09,132
ABRAXAS:
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING IN THE FOOTAGE

272
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,260
It's his doing.

273
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,845
The suspicious guy next to her.

274
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,640
He's something else.

275
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,975
He beat so many guys by himself.

276
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,229
ABRAXAS:
HE'S CLEARLY BETTER THAN YOU

277
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:30,445
THE MORE ELUSIVE YOUR PREY IS,
THE MORE SATISFACTION IT CAN GIVE YOU

278
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:35,450
HUNT YOUR PREY
AND YOUR THIRST WILL BE QUENCHED

279
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,160
The moment he disappears,

280
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,954
I'll get the job done.

281
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:42,624
QUIT

282
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,700
Good morning, ma'am!

283
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,952
Good morning indeed.

284
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,972
Is this what you talked about last time?

285
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,186
Gosh, is it just me
or did the temperature just drop in here?

286
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,896
Then again, it could've been worse.

287
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,066
If I were Ms. Do,
I would've given him the axe right away.

288
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,278
Ms. Do has an axe?

289
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,658
Yes, she does.

290
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,161
You're clueless, aren't you?

291
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,621
What do you mean I'm clueless?

292
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,499
People love me
because I'm perceptive and sociable.

293
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,460
Good for you.

294
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,712
I really envy you.

295
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,631
There's no need to envy me.

296
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:18,845
Did you have a fight?

297
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,472
I mean you and Ms. Do.

298
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,098
I saw you two

299
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,476
holding hands under the table
at the team dinner.

300
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,061
Don't worry.

301
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:29,230
I'm surprisingly an outcast here,
so your secret is safe with me.

302
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,565
So?

303
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:32,067
Did you have a fight?

304
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,291
I can't even read the newspaper in peace.

305
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,795
-Lock the door.
-Yes, sir.

306
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,644
This isn't single-origin.

307
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:08,853
How can anyone call this coffee?

308
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:14,943
This is what helps you
get through the day.

309
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,987
-Is that alcohol?
-Don't mention that right now.

310
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,489
It's instant coffee.

311
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,534
Why would anyone drink this crap?

312
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,869
This was invented to exploit workers.

313
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,204
There's a saying.

314
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:29,457
"Instant coffee is the only pleasure
granted by employers."

315
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,501
-"Pleasure"?
-Yes.

316
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,420
Humans exaggerate too much.

317
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,922
Do you all drink this
to forget that you're slaves?

318
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:38,675
I spent three years hunting for a job.

319
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,552
And my dream back then

320
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:43,555
was to enjoy a cup of instant coffee
in the office.

321
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:48,143
The most important part is
wearing an employee ID around your neck.

322
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:54,149
You must really be cut out to be a slave.

323
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,193
You wasted three years to become a slave?

324
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,906
There you are, Mr. Jeong.

325
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:05,118
-Mr. Jeong, Ms. Do is heading out.
-Here's some advice

326
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,495
from someone
with more experience than you.

327
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,705
Oh, shut it.

328
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,249
"Shut it"? You're so…

329
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:18,214
We shouldn't get paid during breaks,
should we?

330
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:19,382
Right?

331
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,093
Hello? Hi, how are you doing?

332
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,971
Is that Hassan? How's everything, Hassan?

333
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,766
Hassan…

334
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:29,976
Would you like a sip?

335
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:39,402
Ms. Do is heading out.

336
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,165
That's really something.

337
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,602
We're a beverage company.

338
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:16,731
Who had the audacity
to order drinks from another company?

339
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,692
Young people these days…

340
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,612
They're incredible. I admire them.

341
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,037
Where did he go?

342
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,290
Ms. Shin's gone too.

343
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:02,485
Ms. Shin.

344
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,697
Do Do-hee. Are you okay?

345
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,659
Yes, I'm okay.

346
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,287
What's going on?

347
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,330
Ms. Do, I caught the culprit.

348
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,042
His head is twisted!

349
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,919
Is he dead?

350
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:27,760
He's not the culprit.
You got the wrong person.

351
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:29,345
Do you know him?

352
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,060
He's alive.

353
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,649
Director Jeong!

354
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,484
Where are you going?

355
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,403
Who are you? Go away!

356
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,823
-Director Jeong.
-Stay away.

357
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,284
-Director Jeong.
-I said stay away.

358
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:52,827
I was just…

359
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,663
worried because you seemed down.

360
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,958
I wanted to sneak in
to see how you were doing.

361
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,793
I didn't want to look suspicious,

362
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,338
so I disguised myself as a deliveryman.

363
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,131
Great job.

364
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,300
You weren't suspicious at all.

365
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:11,512
I never imagined
they'd think I was the culprit.

366
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,515
Don't I exude goodness even from the back?

367
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,892
-Is that right?
-Yes.

368
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,062
Why would you

369
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,272
do such a pointless thing?

370
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,983
I'd been keeping a proper distance,

371
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,736
but you ruined it all!

372
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,988
"A proper distance"?

373
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:30,698
Right.

374
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,451
Come to think of it,
all of this happened because of you.

375
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:37,372
Ever since you showed me that weird movie,
The Bodyguard or whatever it's called,

376
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,248
something's been wrong with me.

377
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,962
How exactly?

378
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,214
My heart…

379
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,557
My apologies.

380
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:59,185
I hear you're with the Sunwol Foundation.

381
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,522
My apologies for the misunderstanding.

382
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:06,150
But if it hadn't been for
Mr. Park Fork-you acting so suspiciously--

383
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,403
He's with the Sunwol Foundation.

384
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,075
It was careless of me to use violence.

385
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,704
My name isn't Park Fork-you.
It's Park Bok-gyu.

386
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,580
Park Fork-you.

387
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,333
Bok-gyu.

388
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,793
Fuck-you.

389
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,299
-Is it just me?
-Yes.

390
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,927
My current predicament
has put her on edge.

391
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:33,845
I apologize.

392
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,346
Well…

393
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,099
Sure, I understand.

394
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,561
We'd like to compensate you
for both physical and mental injuries.

395
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,104
That won't be…

396
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,440
refused at all.

397
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,818
-That won't be necessary.
-If you say so.

398
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,656
But…

399
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,783
-I'm the one who got hit. Why--
-Zip it.

400
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,790
Are you okay?

401
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,209
Sorry? Yes, I'm fine.

402
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:09,047
Where will the meeting be held?

403
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,215
Right. Please follow me.

404
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,717
-Okay.
-All right.

405
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,687
Let me make something clear.

406
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,647
I'm not sitting back
because I'm incompetent.

407
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,775
I'm letting you take charge

408
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:31,194
because family comes first in crisis.

409
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,488
I appreciate that.

410
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,241
Invest in Mirae Apparel as you promised.

411
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,286
Or that'll be the end of it.

412
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,751
I'm sorry I'm late.

413
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,173
I thought you weren't going to make it.

414
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,634
Of course I made it.
I couldn't leave you here alone.

415
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,804
Before discussing the main agenda,

416
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:01,390
we shall take a vote on entering into
the emergency management system.

417
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,226
This was decided

418
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,061
-Already?
-to minimize confusion

419
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,979
following the chairwoman's passing.

420
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,565
The person we would like to elect
as the acting chair

421
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:12,401
is CEO Noh Suk-min of Mirae Electronics.

422
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,821
Let's hear from Mr. Noh.

423
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,617
My mother spent her entire life
building Mirae Group.

424
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,662
I'll do my best to restore stability
in the organization.

425
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:31,754
All directors, please vote
using the device in front of you.

426
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,596
CEO NOH SUK-MIN AS ACTING CHAIRMAN
IN FAVOR: 16, AGAINST: 2, ABSTENTION: 0

427
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,808
I declare that CEO Noh Suk-min

428
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:47,311
has been elected acting chairman
by a majority vote.

429
00:35:56,821 --> 00:36:00,658
I thank you all for entrusting me
with the position of acting chairman.

430
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,578
I promise to lay the foundation
for the future of Mirae Group.

431
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:15,506
Let's go, Do-hee.

432
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,558
Just how many bodyguards do you have?

433
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,019
What are you so afraid of?

434
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:29,645
But then again,

435
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,398
the more you've sinned,
the guiltier the conscience.

436
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:33,649
It's okay, Seok-hoon.

437
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,527
A barking dog never bites.

438
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,987
It's barking out of fear.

439
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,407
No one's on your side.

440
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,118
At least no one with power.

441
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,913
-Su-ahn.
-Wake up, Seok-hoon.

442
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:50,625
As an investor, shouldn't you be
better at reading the situation?

443
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,126
She can't become chairwoman.

444
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,544
She has way too many enemies.

445
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,046
I won't let that happen,

446
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:57,381
even if it means
I'll have to give up what's mine.

447
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:58,591
Too bad.

448
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,176
It'll happen sooner than you think.

449
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:02,011
Do you think I'll just sit back and watch?

450
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:04,472
I'll look forward to your next move.

451
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,724
Why you little…

452
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:07,934
That's enough.

453
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:13,147
It would break Mother's heart
to see our family make such a scene.

454
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,691
-What family?
-Noh Su-ahn.

455
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:27,662
Everything's happening so fast.
We already have an acting chairman.

456
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,038
The situation called for it.

457
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:32,250
I'll leave the company in your care,
though it'll be brief.

458
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,211
Do-hee.

459
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:38,130
Haste leads to mistakes.

460
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:41,259
And marriage can change your life forever.

461
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,094
So take your time to find the right one.

462
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,013
You can leave the company to me.

463
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,559
That's very reassuring.

464
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,853
But it won't take too long.

465
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,022
Do send me a wedding invitation.

466
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,401
I insist on being there as your family.

467
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,204
Nice tattoo.

468
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,000
It looks good on you.

469
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:22,383
You got a tattoo? When?

470
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,635
Well, recently.

471
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:27,930
I see.

472
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,225
Do you have a minute?

473
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,064
Do-gyeong.

474
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,738
Everyone else came out. Where's Do Do-hee?

475
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:47,950
You know who I am, right?

476
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:49,577
I don't.

477
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,331
Then let me surprise you.

478
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:55,333
I don't like surprises.

479
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,050
I rarely pay attention to our employees,

480
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:07,219
but you caught my eye
when you turned down Do-hee's proposal

481
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,764
at the speed of light.

482
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,724
Are you interested in modeling?

483
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:13,893
I can make you big.

484
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,729
I shouldn't get any bigger.

485
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:20,900
Nice and brusque.

486
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,818
Mr. Jeong Gu-won, right?

487
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,404
Do-hee tells me you saved her many times.

488
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,365
Thank you for being there for her.

489
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,201
Please keep taking good care of my Do-hee.

490
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,538
I didn't do it for you.

491
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:36,916
And you don't need to tell me what to do.

492
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:41,754
Don't mind him.

493
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:44,090
He's equally rude to everyone.

494
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,801
Let's go.

495
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,303
Where are you going?

496
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,471
The two of us need to talk.

497
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,974
"The two of us"?

498
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,269
"My Do-hee"?

499
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:02,024
This is the reason
I was late to the board meeting.

500
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:05,111
"Mirae Group's financial statements"?
They're from two years ago.

501
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,904
I found something suspicious in there.

502
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,616
Two years ago, Mirae Group

503
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:14,286
purchased a ship from a firm
at a rather high price.

504
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,038
But the ship is nowhere to be found.

505
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,415
So I did some digging

506
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,500
and found that the firm
went under recently.

507
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,211
This is a textbook example
of accounting fraud.

508
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,426
What are they cooking up
by themselves in the car?

509
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,595
I'll keep digging.

510
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,181
They can't have cleaned up
all the evidence.

511
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,016
I hope you're right.

512
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:39,353
By the way,

513
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:43,023
isn't it awkward
between you and Mr. Jeong?

514
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,070
Why would it be? We're just working.

515
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:53,367
I'll get going.

516
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:00,958
Take care.

517
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:03,002
I'll let you know if I find anything.

518
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,253
Thanks, Seok-hoon.

519
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:05,629
Anything for you.

520
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,633
"Anything for you," my foot.

521
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:10,551
Do-hee.

522
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,723
Never mind. Take care.

523
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,224
Okay.

524
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:24,815
What's with the longing look?

525
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,047
-What?
-What?

526
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,090
-You were looking at me.
-I was?

527
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,593
Humans can tell
when someone's looking at them.

528
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:53,802
You're delusional.

529
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,058
I'm not anymore.

530
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,561
I won't care about whatever you do,

531
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,146
nor will I read anything into it.

532
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:05,814
That's good to hear.

533
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:12,696
HEAD ATTORNEY
JEONG JUN-HO

534
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,034
Something's definitely fishy.

535
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:19,286
Could we bring criminal charges?

536
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,039
To do that, you'll need solid evidence.

537
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:26,168
Going after a chaebol
could cost you your life.

538
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,712
Circumstantial evidence won't cut it.

539
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,257
We looked into the motorcycle
he was riding,

540
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,759
but it was undocumented and untraceable.

541
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,261
And the sketch

542
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,805
didn't hit any match in our database.

543
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,390
We're not making much progress.

544
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,810
Maybe I should act as bait.

545
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,687
Don't say something so scary.

546
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,730
I understand your concern,

547
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:49,900
but I'll make sure
you can go back to your safe daily life

548
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,027
as soon as possible.

549
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,112
SEOUL SEOCHO POLICE STATION

550
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:54,989
What did you mean by bait?

551
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,533
He would have to show up
in order to harm me.

552
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:59,201
That's our chance to find a clue.

553
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,828
You really are reckless.

554
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:01,912
I'm that desperate.

555
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,332
Also, I hate to admit this,

556
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,585
but you're an excellent bodyguard.

557
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:27,688
Ms. Do Do-hee?

558
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,940
Yes. Nice to meet you.

559
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,150
I'm Prosecutor Choi Woo-sun.

560
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:32,318
I'll do my best

561
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:34,403
as my name suggests.

562
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,909
We finally meet.

563
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:43,537
It's an honor.

564
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:47,791
Please have a seat.

565
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:54,548
And who might this be?

566
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,759
He's my bodyguard. Please understand.

567
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:58,135
No problem.

568
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:01,305
It's just common practice
for the upper class, am I right?

569
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:04,141
I'm sorry about last time.

570
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:05,559
It was for the best.

571
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,227
Your value peaked in the meantime.

572
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,395
My value?

573
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:11,690
I hear you'll be chairwoman.

574
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:13,233
Right.

575
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,612
I ordered for you.

576
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:18,739
You like steak and wine, right?

577
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,240
And you like me too, don't you?

578
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,705
So you're a prosecutor?

579
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:27,831
Be careful,

580
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,958
or I'll indict you

581
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:32,336
for stealing my heart.

582
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,885
Where does he even learn those lines?

583
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,264
Let's eat first.

584
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:47,434
I asked them to serve everything at once.

585
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:51,105
We Koreans love
a table full of food, don't we?

586
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,694
-Would you like to taste it?
-Sure.

587
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:11,542
I like it.

588
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,295
I don't drink during the day.

589
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,464
That's a shame.

590
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:20,467
Then let's meet after sunset next time.

591
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:26,348
I ordered some lobster
following the restaurant's recommendation.

592
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,474
Let me see.

593
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:29,643
Food should be treated the same as wine.

594
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:31,061
One should only take a bite

595
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,355
after enjoying its aroma.

596
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:37,526
Fill your nose with the aroma.

597
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:49,788
Let go.

598
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:52,916
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

599
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,253
What are you doing?

600
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:57,796
I shut his mouth.

601
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,465
I couldn't stand it anymore.

602
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:00,841
Stay out of this.

603
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:03,051
I'm not in the mood for your jokes.

604
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:12,269
Sorry about that.

605
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,938
-Are you okay?
-Of course.

606
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:20,110
The lobster here sure is fresh.

607
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,574
What are you doing later?

608
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,910
I have a trial to attend,

609
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:29,244
but why do you ask?

610
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,497
Let's register our marriage today.

611
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,585
You're full of spunk.

612
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:40,589
People who are meant to do great things

613
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:42,132
are certainly extraordinary.

614
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:45,719
Then…

615
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,473
I'll meet you at the district office
after the trial.

616
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:52,768
See you in a bit.

617
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:57,064
I can't believe
we'll be married in two hours.

618
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:02,277
Neither can I.

619
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:03,612
All right then.

620
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,958
Are you really going to marry
that sleazebag?

621
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,085
He's a prosecutor.

622
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:20,504
I need someone
who can go after the chaebol with me.

623
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,506
Still, you can't marry someone like him.

624
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,134
What do you care?

625
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,725
It doesn't matter who.

626
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:37,354
It's not a real marriage anyway.

627
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,359
Please prepare a press release.

628
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:43,944
The wedding will be held tomorrow.

629
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:46,613
You and Mr. Jeong could be our witnesses.

630
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:48,699
Says who?

631
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:50,867
Please pick out a dress for me, Ms. Shin.

632
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:53,203
Something fancy
that would look good on camera.

633
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,455
As for the ring…

634
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:57,791
There's no need.

635
00:47:57,874 --> 00:47:59,501
I already have one from Madam Ju.

636
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,804
I can't stand it anymore.

637
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:15,267
Marry or divorce whoever you want
for all I care.

638
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:17,352
Just don't make that face in front of me.

639
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,315
Who are you to tell me what face to make?

640
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,692
You look as if you're being
dragged to a slaughterhouse.

641
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:25,944
Then just don't look at me.

642
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,654
You're right. Then I won't.

643
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:35,704
What are you doing?

644
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:38,206
I won't have to be with you
once we catch the culprit.

645
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:40,667
-What?
-Let's catch the bastard.

646
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,757
Pardon me,

647
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,344
but he seems to be
more than we can handle.

648
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,429
We're lucky that we even survived.

649
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:54,306
If we run into him again…

650
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:57,225
Then what?

651
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,102
You bunch of weaklings.

652
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,606
The boss would be turning in his grave.

653
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:04,441
-I'm sorry, sir!
-I'm sorry, sir!

654
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:06,610
Get lost. I can't stand the sight of you!

655
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,279
-We'll get lost, sir.
-Get some rest, sir.

656
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,627
I said get lost.

657
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,257
What are you two doing here?

658
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:31,677
What about the culprit?

659
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,803
As you said,

660
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:34,805
it takes one scumbag to deal with another.

661
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:41,728
You see this?

662
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,400
Bring this bastard to me right now.

663
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:49,611
Are we, the Wild Dogs, a joke to you?

664
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:52,114
Do you think I'll do as you say?

665
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,040
Great.

666
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:04,418
I guess I'll take it out on you.

667
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,056
-Jeong Gu-won.
-So you dodged.

668
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,684
Try and dodge this too.

669
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:27,607
What are you doing?

670
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:28,525
Isn't it obvious?

671
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:29,818
I'm paying him back.

672
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,952
This is all your fault.

673
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:41,830
I've been a mess
ever since you hit me on the head!

674
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,792
Stop it. He might die.

675
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,419
I'm sorry.

676
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:48,795
It's all my fault.

677
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,673
Fine, I'll do as you say.

678
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:54,009
It's too late.

679
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,907
-Give me your wrist.
-No.

680
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,366
Stop getting in the way.

681
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,213
I said stop getting in the way.

682
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,798
Why are you so upset?

683
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:35,675
Pull yourself together
and tell me what your problem is.

684
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,803
You want to know what my problem is?

685
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:40,514
You.

686
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:41,473
You're my problem.

687
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,851
My life was perfect until I met you.

688
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,938
But it's become a mess
since you came into my life.

689
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:55,320
If it weren't for you,

690
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,656
I'd be just fine.

691
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,494
Let's stop this.

692
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:04,788
I'll let you go.

693
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:11,419
You're no longer my bodyguard.

694
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,886
Fine, let's stop with this bodyguard crap.

695
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,142
I'm in danger right now.

696
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:10,353
I don't know who's after me or why.

697
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:13,940
You need your tattoo,
and I need your powers.

698
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,236
This is the only way
for both of us to get what we want.

699
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:23,658
Humans tend to romanticize
unnecessary and inefficient emotions

700
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,202
as part of being human.

701
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:29,998
I'm not going to use you

702
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:32,167
lest I end up
exploiting others' misfortunes.

703
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:34,794
My life was perfect until I met you.

704
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:37,380
But it's become a mess
since you came into my life.

705
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:40,425
I'm human.

706
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:43,053
I'm a person with emotions,
not just a charger for…

707
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:44,512
If it weren't for you,

708
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:45,889
I'd be just fine.

709
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,140
Let's stop this.

710
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,245
Thank you.

711
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:40,128
I'm sorry. Something came up.

712
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,088
I'll be in touch tomorrow.

713
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:09,486
No…

714
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:10,987
No!

715
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:28,671
No!

716
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,632
Don't!

717
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:32,300
Please don't!

718
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:34,886
Please stop!

719
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:36,471
Please!

720
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:12,590
Jeong Gu-won.

721
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,259
Do Do-hee.

722
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:31,961
Do Do-hee could've really died this time.

723
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:35,340
We'll find the person behind all this.
The real culprit behind the disguised one.

724
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:37,592
So what if I kill someone?

725
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:40,345
I must know
exactly what she's going through.

726
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:41,429
And what gives you the right?

727
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:42,805
I'm the only one on her side.

728
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:45,642
What's so funny?
What could possibly be that funny?

729
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:47,060
-Are you getting jealous?
-Jealous?

730
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:49,020
I never understand why people get jealous.

731
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:51,147
Why are you swaying her now?

732
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:52,273
Just because.

733
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:53,566
I don't want Do Do-hee to die.
