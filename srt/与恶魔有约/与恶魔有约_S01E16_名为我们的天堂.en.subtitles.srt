1
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,802
No!

2
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:04,773
Do-hee.

3
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,036
Do-hee.

4
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,038
Do-hee!

5
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,414
No!

6
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,108
"I can do all things…

7
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,363
through him…

8
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,325
who gives me strength."

9
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,139
Gu-won.

10
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:22,934
Do-hee.

11
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,187
Everything's okay now.

12
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,324
Gu-won.

13
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,536
Did you

14
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,913
save me?

15
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,335
I saved myself.

16
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,507
No.

17
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,343
Why?

18
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,857
Gu-won.

19
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,484
No, don't.

20
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,487
No, Gu-won.

21
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,865
I still have so much to tell you.

22
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,492
Gu-won, I know now.

23
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:22,702
I remembered everything.

24
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,996
I was Wolsim, wasn't I?

25
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,707
I was going to kill myself

26
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,584
the day we first met,

27
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,754
but meeting you
made me want to live again.

28
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,592
I don't care what you are.

29
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,178
Just stay with me.

30
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,262
Don't go.

31
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,640
Please don't leave me.

32
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,100
Don't go.

33
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,341
Gu-won.

34
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,426
Gu-won!

35
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,683
Gu-won!

36
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,645
Please don't go!

37
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,499
So…

38
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,170
that's the choice you made.

39
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,533
DEMONS CANNOT KILL THE LIVING
OR BRING THE DEAD BACK TO LIFE

40
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:28,619
UPON BREAKING THIS RULE,
THEY PERISH THROUGH SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION

41
00:05:54,979 --> 00:06:00,443
FINALE
OUR PERSONAL HEAVEN

42
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,738
I guess it's not over till it's over.

43
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,241
Is Mr. Jeong still missing?

44
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,203
Yes. It's certain
that he was at the scene,

45
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,038
but he's been missing for over a week.

46
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,333
Ms. Do is still in shock
and refuses to say anything.

47
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,044
And Noh Suk-min

48
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,297
keeps rambling on about nonsense,

49
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,133
looking as if
he's just crawled out of hell.

50
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,262
I won.

51
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,435
I destroyed both of you
with my own two hands.

52
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,363
Do-hee, open the door!

53
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,701
I think we'll have to break the door open.

54
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,287
Please get started.

55
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:43,671
Ms. Do!

56
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,015
You'll catch a cold.

57
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,436
You should change first.

58
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,522
Go out in the sun and get some fresh air,

59
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,065
or you'll fall into a downward spiral.

60
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,164
I can't…

61
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,877
stand this world.

62
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:32,094
Gu-won is nowhere in this world.

63
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,352
I used to be able to sense…

64
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,524
that he was hovering around me
even if I couldn't see him.

65
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,947
But now…

66
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,076
I can't feel him anywhere.

67
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,497
Do-hee.

68
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,582
You can't go on like this.

69
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,877
At this rate,

70
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,380
you might die as well.

71
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,843
I won't die.

72
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:15,972
I can't.

73
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,394
Not after what
Gu-won went through to save me.

74
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,773
I'm going to endure this living hell.

75
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,528
That's my punishment.

76
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,656
Why should you be punished?

77
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,617
You didn't do anything wrong.

78
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,370
He died because of me.

79
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,623
It's my fault.

80
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,627
If only he hadn't met me.

81
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,841
I'm the one who killed him.

82
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:56,846
It's all my fault.

83
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,349
I killed him.

84
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,323
PATIENT CARD
DO DO-HEE

85
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,836
This is the second time
I've seen Ms. Do like this.

86
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,507
She was like this
at her parents' funeral too.

87
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:39,013
It was as if she had shut herself off
from the world.

88
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:49,899
She had…

89
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,528
barely been holding on,

90
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,827
but she's fallen apart in the end.

91
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,938
-Silent night
-Silent night

92
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,483
-Holy night
-Holy night

93
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:36,695
-All is calm
-All is calm

94
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:40,408
-All is bright
-All is bright

95
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:47,832
-Round yon virgin, mother and child
-Round yon virgin, mother and child

96
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:55,339
-Holy infant, so tender and mild
-Holy infant, so tender and mild

97
00:11:56,382 --> 00:12:03,305
-Sleep in heavenly peace
-Sleep in heavenly peace

98
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:09,770
-Sleep in heavenly peace
-Sleep in heavenly peace

99
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:42,780
Merry Christmas, Gu-won.

100
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,914
I thought we'd be spending
Christmas together,

101
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,625
but you're gone.

102
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,551
It feels like when you died,

103
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,806
a part of me

104
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,850
died with you.

105
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,903
Make a deal with me.

106
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,367
Gu-won.

107
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,578
My wish…

108
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,083
is to have you back.

109
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,362
Gu-won.

110
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,768
Are we

111
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:01,895
in hell?

112
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,053
Am I dead?

113
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,430
Or am I dreaming?

114
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,565
You're neither dreaming

115
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,859
nor dead.

116
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,491
Merry Christmas, Do-hee.

117
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,665
I'm back.

118
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,259
I still can't believe it.

119
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:02,432
The world without you was terrible.

120
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,066
Same here.

121
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,070
Being without you

122
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,282
is hell to me.

123
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,078
Give me your hand.

124
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,469
Let me charge up.

125
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,056
Go ahead.

126
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,057
Let's charge up.

127
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:53,775
Thank you.

128
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,152
Thank you so much!

129
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:01,325
Christmas miracles do happen.

130
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,828
But why did you do it?

131
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,456
You said you were a mere companion
on the journey of everything.

132
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,792
She wanted a deal.

133
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,838
Since you were gone, I had to step in.

134
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,173
A deal?

135
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,302
Are you saying you're sending her to hell?

136
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,222
Don't you play with us again--

137
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,640
Don't worry.

138
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,225
The payment for her deal

139
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,518
has already been made.

140
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,022
Let's make a bet.

141
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,191
If I get my powers back

142
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,817
and Do Do-hee lives,

143
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:36,985
you lose.

144
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,153
I told you.

145
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,364
That's never going to happen.

146
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,282
Is it still valid?

147
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,743
I mean the bet I won.

148
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,997
If I ever have a wish,

149
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:51,959
will you grant it?

150
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,128
Are you asking me for help?

151
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:57,714
Yes.

152
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,763
I need all the help I can get right now,

153
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,558
even if it's from you,
whom I trust the least.

154
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:23,824
If I had compassion,
I would've gone crazy.

155
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:28,578
There are too many
pitiful lives in the world.

156
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:32,165
So I didn't think I possessed

157
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,085
such human emotions.

158
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:40,882
You were right.

159
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,135
One should

160
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,971
never say never.

161
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,307
You were also right.

162
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,726
Happiness has no meaning
without misfortune.

163
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,936
I get that now.

164
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,607
So we're even now.

165
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,484
But come to think of it,

166
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,571
it's rather fortunate

167
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,949
that you don't have a knack for gambling.

168
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,287
-I don't?
-No.

169
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,873
-I don't have a knack for gambling?
-Not at all.

170
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,916
I've only lost once!
Let's make another bet!

171
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,711
If I win this time,
you'll cease to exist for good!

172
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:18,837
No!

173
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,213
Not in a million years.

174
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:23,759
I love living among humans now.

175
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,845
Also, you still need a worker.

176
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:30,974
You'd never find another worker
as handsome and hard-working as me.

177
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,393
Goodness!

178
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,438
I guess…

179
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,650
you're the perfect fit.

180
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,527
I agree.

181
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:44,529
My goodness.

182
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,747
SUNWOL FOUNDATION

183
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:57,292
"Without powers, the body of a demon
is no different from that of a human…"

184
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,210
Director Jeong!

185
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,670
My goodness. Director Jeong!

186
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,718
You scared me. What are you, a buffalo?

187
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:07,928
Director Jeong.

188
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,596
Ga-young. Please stay away.

189
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,851
I just barely escaped death.
Are you trying to kill me?

190
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,730
We thought you were gone for good.

191
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,357
What are you talking about? I'm a demon.

192
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,109
Why would I die?

193
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:32,077
Christmas is already over.
Why decorate the tree now?

194
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,370
Who cares?

195
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,914
Our Christmas is just beginning.

196
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:42,629
I'm starting to understand
what you said about Christmas.

197
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:43,755
What do you mean?

198
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,257
That Christmas somehow makes you excited.

199
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:46,967
I'm the same way.

200
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,595
Being with you makes me excited.

201
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,725
You must be my Christmas.

202
00:23:58,186 --> 00:23:59,604
Do you feel like a kid again?

203
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:01,731
That's also true.

204
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,445
The most important part.

205
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,186
Can you tell me…

206
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,026
about the deal you made with my dad?

207
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,242
I want to know,

208
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,994
even if it's an inconvenient truth.

209
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:05,879
That day…

210
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,550
it was pouring rain.

211
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,053
Traffic update.

212
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,013
There was a 12-vehicle collision

213
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,265
at the intersection
south of the Seongsu Bridge.

214
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,434
due to heavy rainfall.

215
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,067
Honey.

216
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,527
Are you okay?

217
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,405
Doctor!

218
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,576
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

219
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,994
We're almost there.

220
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,246
Hang in there, honey.

221
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,085
Just a second, doctor!

222
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,087
Please examine my wife.
We were in a car accident.

223
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,923
Sorry. But all our beds are full,
even in the emergency room.

224
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:52,133
Please find another hospital. I'm sorry.

225
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,730
Honey!

226
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:10,193
Something doesn't feel right.

227
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:15,532
No, this can't be happening.

228
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,243
Help!

229
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:19,995
Someone help!

230
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:25,208
Please, someone save my wife.

231
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,712
No, honey.

232
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,515
Please help.

233
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:43,143
My wife will die
if she doesn't see a doctor right now.

234
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:49,107
Saving two lives by granting one wish.

235
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,775
Not bad.

236
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,360
I'll grant your wish.

237
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,904
On one condition.

238
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,573
It doesn't matter.

239
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:57,657
I'll do anything.

240
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,075
Shouldn't you still hear it?

241
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:01,036
You might regret it.

242
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,454
No.

243
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:04,372
I'll never regret it.

244
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,334
Well, suit yourself then.

245
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:28,355
You saved me back then too.

246
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,067
It wasn't me.

247
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,402
It was your father.

248
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:36,613
His sacrifice…

249
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:39,699
saved you.

250
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,538
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

251
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,834
I didn't want to confuse you further.

252
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,838
Because it's true

253
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:55,965
that I made you miserable.

254
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,844
You didn't make me miserable.

255
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:04,224
I spent ten wonderful years
with my parents.

256
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:08,520
They did their absolute best

257
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,523
every moment,

258
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:16,152
probably because they knew
they had limited time with me.

259
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,830
You saved me.

260
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,458
Both in my past life

261
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:32,877
and in this one.

262
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,092
You saved me as well.

263
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,512
You saved me…

264
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,684
from eternal destruction.

265
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,728
MIRAE F&B

266
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,195
Good morning.

267
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,071
Good morning to you too.

268
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:43,865
Long time no see.

269
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,575
Good morning.

270
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,416
Thank you, Ms. Shin.

271
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,293
No, thank you.

272
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,547
I'm happy to see you again.

273
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,717
Likewise.

274
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,553
Mr. Ju Seok-hoon is waiting for you.

275
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:15,063
They've been gone for a while,

276
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,523
and they're totally glowing.

277
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,858
They always have been.

278
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:21,402
Both Ms. Do and Mr. Jeong.

279
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:22,987
They must've been on a trip.

280
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:27,075
No, I have a feeling
there's something more to it.

281
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,076
Like what?

282
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,744
Beats me.

283
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,789
But they seem to share a strong bond,

284
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,833
as if they overcame
an immense hardship together.

285
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,627
After hearing
someone clueless like you say that,

286
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,379
I'm more convinced
that they were on a trip.

287
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:41,589
I'm telling you, that's not it.

288
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:44,717
Mr. Jeong.

289
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:49,097
Didn't I say I wouldn't just sit back
if you ever hurt Do-hee?

290
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,431
What's with him?

291
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,646
Don't you dare disappear again,
or I'll make you regret it.

292
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,858
You and your obsession with me.

293
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,150
I get it, so let go of me.

294
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,195
I'm glad to see you back.

295
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,281
I said I got it.

296
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,242
Jeez, our ears are touching.

297
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:11,327
Do-hee, help.

298
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:12,620
Look at me.

299
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,581
-Don't ever get hurt.
-Do-hee.

300
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,291
Do-hee.

301
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,668
I get it, okay?

302
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:21,504
-Two brisket soups to table seven.
-Here are two bowls of rice.

303
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:24,090
-Did you enjoy your meal?
-It was really good.

304
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,550
Thank you.

305
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:32,765
Collect ten stamps
and get a free bowl of rice soup.

306
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,434
Thank you.

307
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:38,229
We look forward to serving you again!

308
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,189
-We'll serve you again!
-We'll serve you again!

309
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,570
How dare you serve someone other than me?

310
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,782
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE GRAND OPENING
BYE, UNDERWORLD, HELLO, SUNNY SPOT

311
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,715
Welcome, boss!

312
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,550
-Welcome, boss!
-Welcome, boss!

313
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,804
You didn't have to.

314
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,514
I heard your rice soup
is all the rage now.

315
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,891
Bring me a bowl.

316
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,185
I'll go for the assorted toppings.

317
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:22,941
One drop-dead delicious rice soup
with assorted toppings, please!

318
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,193
-One rice soup with assorted toppings!
-One rice soup with assorted toppings!

319
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,488
Will my food be on the house?

320
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,783
-It says "9,000 won," doesn't it?
-Then I'll pass.

321
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,493
It's on the house, of course.

322
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,579
How have you been?

323
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:40,375
-Your face has become so thin.
-I haven't been eating well lately.

324
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,793
What?

325
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:44,128
More than half the board
is on Do Do-hee's side?

326
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:49,092
I don't believe this!

327
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,680
Will that brat Do-hee
really become the chairwoman?

328
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,936
I can't give up like this.

329
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,605
I have one last resort.

330
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,790
What brings you here?

331
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:21,958
It's…

332
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:24,877
a family matter.

333
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,342
Ms. Noh Su-ahn,
who claims to be your family, is here.

334
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:39,726
Greet her, boys.

335
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,859
What are you doing here with your kids?

336
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,123
I'm sorry for everything, Do-hee.

337
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,875
My sincere apologies.

338
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,211
Do you remember?

339
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,797
Austin right here
used to be so fond of you.

340
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,174
I'm Justin.

341
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,011
Justin right here
used to be so fond of you.

342
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,263
Don't you worry
about the future of Mirae Group.

343
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:20,391
Austin and Justin are undergoing
thorough successor training.

344
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:23,811
They'll be supporting you
from either side of you in the future.

345
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,689
Justin on your left
and Austin on your right.

346
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,232
How reassuring is that?

347
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,318
Justin on your left
and Austin on your right.

348
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,112
Justin here on your left,
and Austin here on your right.

349
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,113
The two of them.

350
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,199
Do-hee!

351
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,326
Do-hee!

352
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,328
I'll try harder.

353
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,831
I'm sure you'll recognize
my sincerity someday.

354
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,751
We're family, right? Do-hee!

355
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:50,630
Justin?

356
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:53,508
Austin?

357
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,554
Let's go.

358
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,492
Family?

359
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,454
CIVIL AFFAIRS OFFICE

360
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,874
NAME: DO DO-HEE

361
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,295
RELATIONSHIP: FAMILY

362
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,439
You seem fine.

363
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,317
You sure have a heart of stone.

364
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:57,029
Everyone around you
died off because of you,

365
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,573
but you don't bat an eye.

366
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:00,867
I'm sorry to tell you this,

367
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,536
but you failed to destroy anyone.

368
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,873
Gu-won's back,

369
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,750
and I'm unscathed, as you can see.

370
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,174
Do you expect me to believe that?

371
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,843
Look at me.

372
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:23,222
I'm not hurt by anything you say.

373
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,018
I can't just be pretending, can I?

374
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,530
The only thing you managed to destroy

375
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,117
is yourself.

376
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,175
Quiet!

377
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:01,719
Noh Suk-min!

378
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,596
Calm down, Noh Suk-min!

379
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:08,267
Once I get out of here,

380
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,061
I'll kill them with my own two hands.

381
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,562
No matter how long it takes,

382
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:12,939
I'll kill them myself.

383
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,953
Mother.

384
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,794
Why are you looking at me like that?

385
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,546
Don't look at me like that!

386
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,965
Stop it!

387
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:42,760
Someone help!

388
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,011
Hello?

389
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:47,098
I said stop it!

390
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,808
Go away!

391
00:37:56,857 --> 00:38:00,403
Ma'am, should I tell them
to move the stuff out?

392
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,696
Yes, please go ahead.

393
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,325
Ma'am…

394
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,577
What do you want to do with this?

395
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:09,954
JIU-JITSU 2 DAN, NOH DO-GYEONG

396
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,874
-Just throw it away, please.
-Okay.

397
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,175
My goodness.
You should've been more careful.

398
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,093
I'm sorry.

399
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,708
10 YEARS AGO

400
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,461
Are you going to the gym again?

401
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,671
Do you realize what time it is?

402
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,343
Why do you have to go this far?

403
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:08,554
I need to protect…

404
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,265
myself…

405
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:13,934
and you.

406
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,440
Do…

407
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,276
Do-gyeong!

408
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,332
But this is…

409
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:37,792
ACNE SCAR TREATMENT

410
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,045
Goodness.

411
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,631
I'm sorry.

412
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,633
It's okay. I have one for wounds.

413
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,469
-Mom.
-Yeah?

414
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,222
See you later.

415
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,458
I'll video chat you every day.

416
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:24,672
To think how lonely you'll be
in a foreign country.

417
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,299
Let's part ways with a smile.

418
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,386
Take care of yourself in England.

419
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,097
Don't skip meals
even if you're not used to the food.

420
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,641
-Okay.
-Don't strain yourself while rehearsing.

421
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:37,518
And before going to bed…

422
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:39,603
Enough.

423
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:43,816
Jin Ga-young.

424
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,901
Are you leaving without saying goodbye?

425
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,243
I thought I might waver if I saw you.

426
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:56,203
Here.

427
00:40:57,037 --> 00:41:00,458
I looked it up,
and it rains a lot in England.

428
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,750
Take this with you.

429
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:04,920
I could buy one there.

430
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,381
He wants you to think of him
every time it rains.

431
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:11,010
This will be a reminder of him for you.

432
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,513
That's reaching. It's just an umbrella.

433
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,809
Fine.

434
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:20,478
If you…

435
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,522
If you ever want to come back,

436
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,401
you're welcome here…

437
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,446
anytime.

438
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,992
See? You're making me waver.

439
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,330
Have a good life, Director Jeong.

440
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,250
You too, Mr. Park.

441
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:01,936
Sir, hold on.

442
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,277
I knew it.

443
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:14,532
I knew coming back here
would make me want to leave.

444
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,163
Are you okay?

445
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,124
Hey.

446
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,543
What happened to your face?

447
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:32,341
Come here.

448
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,262
I said come here.

449
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,184
Are you her dad?

450
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,185
So what if I am?

451
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:45,271
That doesn't give you
the right to hit her.

452
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:47,940
I didn't hit her.
She tripped and fell while playing.

453
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:52,152
Who are you anyway?

454
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,071
Why are you butting in--

455
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:55,114
Is this the police?

456
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:57,366
I'd like to report a child abuse case.

457
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:58,617
Hang up right now.

458
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,327
-Yes, the address is…
-Why, you little…

459
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:12,089
Don't you know what a guardian is?

460
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,340
I'm her parent.

461
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,552
Can't I even discipline my own child?

462
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:18,554
What is this nonsense?

463
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:20,264
Child abuse, my ass.

464
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:22,474
She tripped and fell while playing,
that's all.

465
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:25,894
I'll miss my flight if I don't leave now.

466
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,272
Aren't you going?

467
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:03,682
Ta-da.

468
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,476
These are for you.

469
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:19,823
They look good on you.

470
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:23,577
Are you an angel?

471
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:30,125
Are you an angel?

472
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,753
Me? What makes you think so?

473
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,547
You saved me.

474
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,351
Yes, I am.

475
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,568
Call me whenever something happens.

476
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,196
Don't forget.

477
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,323
Angels…

478
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:04,785
Angels…

479
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:07,704
never come to save you.

480
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:11,041
…always come to save you.

481
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,713
Okay, angel.

482
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,094
Are you going or not?

483
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,767
I'm not.

484
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:30,352
I have unfinished business here.

485
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,038
Please drink.

486
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:02,009
I heard that
you're resigning from the board.

487
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:07,014
I plan on starting a center
for child victims of domestic violence.

488
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:13,395
I know it won't make up
for all my wrongdoings.

489
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,314
But…

490
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:18,609
I don't want to turn a blind eye anymore.

491
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,032
I'm sorry

492
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:27,784
for turning a blind eye all this time.

493
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:31,788
Thank you for finding the courage.

494
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:37,169
Please let me know
if I can help you with anything

495
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:39,004
regarding your center.

496
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:40,923
Okay,

497
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:42,758
I will.

498
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:51,808
My tarot reading predicted
I'd get a boyfriend this year,

499
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:53,977
but I've been single all year.

500
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:58,398
Cheer up, Ms. Choi.

501
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,235
There's still one day left
until the year ends.

502
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,153
That's right. It's too early to give up.

503
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,697
That only makes me feel more miserable.

504
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,449
On that note,

505
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:08,742
how about a team dinner?

506
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,582
Sounds good!

507
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,417
Let's go have that team dinner.

508
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:20,254
I guess she's getting old too.

509
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,548
Do we have another team dinner maniac now?

510
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,384
I'll pass.

511
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:28,512
I'd like to welcome the new year
with my family.

512
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:29,888
We're family too, aren't we?

513
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:32,307
Come on. Don't you have a personal life?

514
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:37,229
I don't have one, even at home.

515
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,901
Let's go have that team dinner.

516
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,561
Ms. Shin!

517
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:22,816
Where are we going?

518
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,613
Everyone, I have an announcement to make.

519
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,698
Why are you doing this?

520
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:35,787
The two of us are in a relationship.

521
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:45,339
This man here,
Mr. Park Bok-gyu, is my man.

522
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:50,927
He's the most innocent
and kind-hearted person in the world.

523
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:54,514
Ms. Shin.

524
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,479
-I see.
-I see.

525
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:01,647
I see.

526
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,148
You've finally said it.

527
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,650
It's finally over.

528
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:07,110
It's been so hard to play dumb.

529
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:10,238
Does that mean you all had figured it out?

530
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:13,241
It's not that we figured it out.

531
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,873
Let's just take one photo strip.

532
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:21,750
All right. One strip and we're leaving.

533
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:27,005
We're leaving after one strip, okay?

534
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:29,466
All right, we will.

535
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:30,676
You look so cute.

536
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,054
All right.

537
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:36,139
Do I look pretty?

538
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,350
-No.
-In the name of love and justice…

539
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:44,064
-Is that…
-Ms.…

540
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:45,482
Shin?

541
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:58,495
Shall we say

542
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:01,415
you already made a declaration of sorts?

543
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:21,351
4 MONTHS LATER

544
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,165
How are you doing this?

545
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:48,962
Sir.

546
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:51,256
That's enough exercise. Let's go.

547
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:53,133
I can't die like this.

548
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,135
My mom

549
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:58,138
recently got diagnosed
with a terminal illness.

550
00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:03,059
Once she passes away,

551
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,979
I'll go with you.

552
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:09,858
Stop acting so pitiful.
I'm starting to feel sorry.

553
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:12,235
My mom…

554
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:15,113
She'll be miserable without me.

555
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,491
Please have mercy on me.

556
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:22,913
Hold on.

557
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:24,790
Take five.

558
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:26,625
Yes, Mr. Park?

559
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:29,419
I've looked into Oh Jin-sang,
whose contract expires today.

560
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:33,048
And he's a real piece of work.

561
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:35,675
He beat up his own mother so often

562
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:39,262
that more than ten reports
have been made so far.

563
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:42,349
That little wimp
asked you to make him stronger

564
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,309
only to harass people.

565
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:45,811
It doesn't end there.

566
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,687
That'll be enough.

567
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,027
Thank you.

568
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:55,695
For what?

569
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,155
For being

570
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:59,407
a total scumbag.

571
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:08,583
Understood.

572
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,419
The chairperson is coming.

573
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:34,442
MIRAE GROUP
CHAIRPERSON

574
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,320
I made it just in time.

575
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:42,951
"Reach Zero through the Holy Spirit"?

576
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:45,287
I've repented and turned to Catholicism,
just like my mom.

577
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:48,582
This is a hybrid
of my faith and weight loss.

578
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:51,293
OVERCOME HUNGER THROUGH FAITH

579
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:53,128
-What does zero mean?
-Size zero.

580
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:55,714
Taking care of your soul isn't enough.

581
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:58,133
You should take care of your body as well.

582
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,819
I'm sorry I'm late.

583
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:21,489
I had a lot of documents to go over
before my first meeting as the chairman.

584
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:22,490
Let's get started.

585
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:23,867
Before we start the meeting,

586
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,118
each subsidiary will report

587
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:27,495
on their performance
for the first quarter.

588
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:29,539
I've already reviewed the reports.

589
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:33,543
Our first-half operating margin
significantly increased from last year.

590
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:37,047
However, my research reveals

591
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:40,592
that this rapid improvement
stemmed from a substantial reduction

592
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:43,261
in personnel expenses
and employee benefits,

593
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:46,306
which is the easiest way to boost numbers.

594
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:50,185
While results matter,
the process is much more important

595
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:53,313
in fostering better long-term performance.

596
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,815
Moving forward,

597
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:58,610
Mirae Group will not take any shortcuts

598
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:00,111
in order to create results.

599
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:10,914
Great job, sir.

600
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,709
-Thank you for your work.
-Thank you.

601
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:17,253
You came prepared.

602
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,714
Research is my forte.

603
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,134
By the way, Do-hee,

604
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:27,389
are you really okay
with my taking over the chairman position?

605
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:31,226
You know I refuse to get any help
from Madam Ju.

606
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,645
If I became the chairwoman,

607
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:35,855
it'd be mostly thanks to Madam Ju's will.

608
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:39,150
It would be frustrating
to need her help after all this time.

609
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,694
That's very like you.

610
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:43,154
I've always known
what an incredible person you are.

611
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,448
Don't let your guard down.

612
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:49,119
I might grow my company big enough
to take over Mirae Group.

613
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:51,871
-Seok-hoon.
-Hi, Su-ahn.

614
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:54,624
Excellent.

615
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,668
A young leader sure is different.

616
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:57,711
Thanks.

617
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:00,672
Do you remember?

618
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:04,009
Austin used to be so fond of you.

619
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:06,302
Don't you worry
about the future of Mirae Group.

620
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,888
Austin and Justin are undergoing
thorough successor training.

621
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,349
Justin will be on your left
and Austin on your right.

622
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,435
And I'll be supporting you as well.

623
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,103
-Su-ahn.
-Yeah?

624
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:17,063
-Come up with some new lines.
-I've got your back.

625
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,273
Take care of yourself.

626
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:21,109
Eat healthy and work out hard.

627
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:22,986
Keep in mind that I've got your back.

628
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:24,612
CHIEF PROSECUTOR CHOI WOO-SUN

629
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:25,530
Yes.

630
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:27,490
Okay, all right.

631
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:32,662
The Supreme Court
upheld the death sentence.

632
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:39,669
As you may know,
that implies no possibility of parole.

633
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:44,299
Noh Suk-min will now rot in prison
for the rest of his life.

634
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:46,259
That's a relief.

635
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:48,970
He can no longer harm anyone.

636
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:50,680
By the way,

637
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:53,391
something came to my attention
while investigating,

638
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:55,769
and I think you should know.

639
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:58,897
The late Chairwoman Ju Cheon-suk

640
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,940
had a health checkup before she passed.

641
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,358
That's right.

642
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:07,864
That was my condition
for going on a blind date with you.

643
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:10,658
But the checkup revealed

644
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:14,120
that she had terminal pancreatic cancer.

645
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:17,123
Pardon?

646
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,460
What are you talking about?

647
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:21,669
According to her doctor,

648
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:25,131
her symptoms were so severe
that she was aware of her condition.

649
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:41,356
Madam Ju.

650
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:45,693
Is that why you kept pestering me
to get married?

651
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:47,570
So that I wouldn't be left alone again?

652
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,158
Why didn't you tell me?

653
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:55,120
Then I would've been nicer to you

654
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:57,122
and loved you as much as I wanted.

655
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,128
You must've been in a lot of pain.

656
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:10,802
You said you had lies flowing
through your veins instead of blood,

657
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:12,428
and it was true.

658
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:29,320
Don't you worry anymore.

659
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:33,116
I have someone on my side now.

660
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,507
Humans can now live up to 130 years?

661
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,760
I mean, 130 years pass

662
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,929
in the blink of an eye.

663
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:58,266
It's too short.

664
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:00,643
Gu-won!

665
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,021
Time for cake, your favorite.

666
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:06,232
No!

667
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:08,401
-You can't eat it.
-Why not?

668
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,528
Do you know how bad sugar is for humans?

669
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:13,281
You should stay away from these things
to live long.

670
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:15,074
I'll have just a little.

671
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,659
No! Don't.

672
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:17,577
You can't.

673
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,621
I run a dessert company.

674
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:21,706
From now on, sell health foods only.

675
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,417
I'll have to eat all of it myself.

676
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,045
-Share it with me.
-No.

677
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:29,756
It looks so bad. Let me take care of it.

678
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,216
-Why?
-Eat something else.

679
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:33,343
Have some red ginseng
over there or something.

680
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:34,594
I paid for this.

681
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:44,896
Look at the night view.

682
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:46,731
You're missing such a beautiful sight.

683
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:49,817
It's involuntary.
I can't take my eyes off you.

684
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:53,613
I can't help it.

685
00:58:59,035 --> 00:58:59,994
Do-hee.

686
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:02,497
Your time

687
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:05,542
goes by too fast.

688
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:13,174
That's what makes

689
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:16,177
this moment even more precious.

690
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:53,131
-Mr. Park.
-Director Jeong.

691
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:55,967
Listen, you should never get married.

692
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:58,386
-What?
-I had a fight with Do-hee,

693
00:59:58,469 --> 01:00:02,557
and she's been playing hymns and chants
from all religions all day.

694
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,602
She'd even sell her soul
to get on my nerves.

695
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:07,103
Also!

696
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:08,563
Isn't this so childish?

697
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:10,189
Does she think this is a diary?

698
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,150
She thinks she can do whatever she wants.

699
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,527
Director Jeong.

700
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,070
Why aren't you taking my side?

701
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:19,032
Why are your eyes twitching? What is it?

702
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:20,992
What?

703
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:25,913
What?

704
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,005
Hubby.

705
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:36,466
Can we talk?

706
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:40,136
I thought we were done talking.

707
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:41,179
No, we weren't.

708
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,808
I'll go work on the performance.

709
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:48,519
-Don't go, buffalo.
-Goodbye, Mr. Park.

710
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:50,313
I'll leave you two to talk.

711
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:53,483
What's this? A frog?

712
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:54,609
It's so pretty.

713
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:56,277
A frog, a flower,

714
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:57,570
-a chick…
-Hubby.

715
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,906
It scares me when you call me hubby.

716
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:02,116
-What?
-Never mind.

717
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,870
Is it so hard to tell me beforehand
when you'll be home late?

718
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:07,914
It slips my mind
when I'm too busy with work.

719
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:10,708
You stay out late making deals
without telling me too.

720
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:13,336
That's a different story.

721
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,797
How so?

722
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:20,134
How can you compare my deals
to the insignificant jobs humans do?

723
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:23,554
Do you know what I've been going through
to only make deals with scumbags?

724
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:26,724
Are you saying

725
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:30,186
that what you do is important
while what I do is trivial?

726
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,773
-That's not what I meant.
-Forget it.

727
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,991
Caught in the crossfire
of hatred and misfortune,

728
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,910
we ceaselessly

729
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:50,373
hurt each other
and destroy each other's souls.

730
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,461
However,

731
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:57,505
despite all that,

732
01:01:58,798 --> 01:01:59,882
our lives

733
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:02,802
and this world continue.

734
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,223
Perhaps that's because
there are more people

735
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,600
who save each other

736
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:12,311
with their love and trust.

737
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:18,317
Let go.

738
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:19,777
I hate you the most.

739
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:24,157
I love you.

740
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:26,826
A lot.

741
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:33,249
I hate you the most,

742
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:36,294
but I love you the most too.

743
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,173
Do-hee.

744
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:43,634
You're my everything.

745
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:12,497
Silly humans.

746
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:26,594
-This looks good.
-How about this one?

747
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:27,762
That's a bit…

748
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:30,223
If you want something bright,
how about blue?

749
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:31,557
-It looks good.
-Do you like it?

750
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,184
-I think it's boring.
-It's boring?

751
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:34,310
Then how about pink?

752
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:35,686
-That's cute.
-Right?

753
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,230
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

754
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:42,985
Do you know why
the dinosaurs went extinct?

755
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:46,906
-A comet crashed into…
-Poor performance.

756
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:48,866
Their performance
didn't live up to their size.

757
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:51,118
No.

758
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:54,455
It was because of poor work-life balance.

759
01:03:55,456 --> 01:03:56,749
Let's go home.

760
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,168
-Let's go home!
-Nice!

761
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:00,628
-That's what I'm talking about!
-Yes!

762
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:02,713
-Yes!
-Let's go home!

763
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:04,006
Let's go!

764
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:09,136
Let's go home!

765
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:19,105
One more time?

766
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:30,283
Gu-won!

767
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:44,005
I love you.

768
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:58,227
We may destroy each other at times,

769
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:02,106
but we're also the ones
who save each other.

770
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:04,400
Therefore,

771
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:07,403
we are both each other's destroyers

772
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:10,406
and saviors.

773
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:08,274
