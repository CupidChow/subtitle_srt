1
00:00:58,683 --> 00:00:59,642
It's gone.

2
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,398
We managed to get out alive.

3
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:15,700
I thought I was really going to…

4
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,283
What are you?

5
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,829
Who on earth are you?

6
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,622
What have you done to me?

7
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:51,254
EPISODE 2
EVERYONE HAS A DEMON IN THEIR HEART

8
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,178
Ms. Do.

9
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,514
-Ms. Shin.
-Are you all right?

10
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:46,267
I just had a nightmare.

11
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,646
What was it about?
You're soaked with sweat.

12
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,360
I'm glad to see that you're up.

13
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,196
I was worried sick.

14
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,576
Am I still in my nightmare?

15
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,621
Relax. Your nightmare's over.

16
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,212
I brought you to the hospital
after getting a call from him.

17
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,129
Hospital?

18
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,174
My goodness. Am I hurt?

19
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,218
I don't have time for this.

20
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,178
-How long was I out?
-To be exact,

21
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,723
you were in deep sleep
for 5 hours 38 minutes.

22
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:28,768
So I was asleep.

23
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,144
How are you feeling?

24
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,855
Are you dizzy or unable to move your arms?

25
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:33,982
Is anything bothering you?

26
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,110
-Why are you acting weird?
-Lie down for a bit.

27
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,988
You should rest
until the doctor says you're fine.

28
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,746
I'll go get the doctor.

29
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,337
What?

30
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,382
What are you up to?

31
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,343
What do you mean?

32
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,178
Yes, that's more like you.

33
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,556
You're far from gentle and thoughtful.

34
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,766
You didn't want anyone
to think I'm your ex.

35
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,977
That's why I was being polite
as you requested.

36
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,938
Now they'd think we're dating.

37
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:17,442
There's no pleasing you, is there?

38
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,031
Did they catch the person
who hit us with a car?

39
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,741
They will soon.

40
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,118
I gave them a detailed description of him.

41
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,536
It should be a piece of cake.

42
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,166
But are you sure you're okay?

43
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,130
I'm aching all over,
but other than that, I'm okay.

44
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,674
You seem…

45
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,261
fine.

46
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,972
Unfortunately, I'm not fine at all.

47
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,807
That's why I've been waiting for you.

48
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,311
What?

49
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,271
What's this tattoo sticker?

50
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,148
"Tattoo sticker"?

51
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,734
What's this tacky thing doing on my wrist?

52
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:00,777
"Tacky"?

53
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,071
What do you think you're doing?

54
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,363
-Don't.
-It won't come off.

55
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,533
Stop. You might ruin it.

56
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:09,660
No way.

57
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,247
Is this a real tattoo?

58
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,083
What on earth happened last night?

59
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,762
Good. It's coming back to you.

60
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,722
It would've been bad
if you also didn't know what--

61
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,100
Was I that drunk?

62
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,894
Did we end up in Hongdae or something?

63
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:38,439
Why didn't you try to talk me out of it?

64
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,942
All right, I'm going to
laser off this tattoo.

65
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,819
No lasers!

66
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,531
What are you doing? Move.

67
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,241
Over my dead body.

68
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,867
How are you going to stop me?

69
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,954
What's it to you if I laser it off
or cover it with a Pororo picture?

70
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,372
Pororo?

71
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,544
Don't you dare even touch your wrist.

72
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,254
Or else…

73
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,213
I'll make you regret it.

74
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,175
-It's my wrist.
-It's my tattoo.

75
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,260
What nonsense is that?

76
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,846
It's on your wrist right now
for some unknown reason,

77
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,014
but this tattoo is mine.

78
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,100
Are you out of your mind?

79
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,893
-Let go.
-I won't.

80
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,146
-I said let go.
-I said I won't.

81
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:20,815
You better let go.

82
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:21,899
No.

83
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:22,984
Who knows what you'd do to it?

84
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,610
This is your last warning.

85
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,071
One, two, three.

86
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,582
Why can't I…

87
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,469
There you go.

88
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:55,850
I knew it.

89
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,311
I didn't mean to hit you that hard.

90
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,229
I was just forcing my arm to move.

91
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,900
How dare you steal what's mine
after I saved you?

92
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,277
Steal?

93
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,487
I must've been out of my mind.

94
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,990
I should've just left you to be killed
for all I care.

95
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,450
That's my line.

96
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,203
I should've just left a scumbag like you
to be eaten by fish.

97
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,915
I just saved you from drowning.
Now you want my tattoo?

98
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,708
As if! I'm the one who saved you!

99
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,883
How are you feeling?

100
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,301
Doctor, can you take a look…

101
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,970
I'm feeling extremely uncomfortable.

102
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,138
Pardon?

103
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,349
Let me check your eyes.

104
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,393
Sir, she's not going to be okay, right?

105
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,063
No, I mean… She's going to be okay, right?

106
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,856
The signs of exhaustion are gone.

107
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,816
-Everything seems fine.
-What?

108
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,235
What do you mean, Doctor?

109
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,362
I'm pretty sure I'm out of my mind.

110
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,909
Ms. Do is such an extraordinary person.

111
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,411
She maintains her sense of humor
even in tough times.

112
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,873
I see. Well then…

113
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:07,964
Was his name Jeong Gu-won?

114
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,883
You mean the good-looking victim
with a bad attitude?

115
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,263
He's been on my mind.

116
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,514
Why?

117
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:17,974
I wonder where he buys his clothes.

118
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,141
Are they expensive?

119
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,643
I'd look good in them too, right?

120
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,689
It's not his clothes that you want.

121
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:27,233
-Then what?
-It's his face, body,

122
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,859
and whole existence.

123
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:35,908
Hello.

124
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,829
I'm Sergeant Park Kyung-soo,
the officer in charge of your case.

125
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,291
You're still here.

126
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,127
I wanted to make sure everything was okay.

127
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,963
As you can see, I'm perfectly okay.
So you should leave.

128
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,548
I'm relieved to hear that.

129
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:54,468
I asked them to keep it from everyone,
including Chairwoman Ju.

130
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,386
Good.

131
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,138
I'm sorry to bother you,

132
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,181
but we need your statement.

133
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,766
Anything to catch the criminal.

134
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,476
By the way,

135
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,437
I heard that you two met on a blind date.

136
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,188
Considering what happened,

137
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,566
the two of you should get married.

138
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,692
-No.
-No.

139
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,322
I don't plan on getting married.

140
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,656
I plan on staying single my whole life.

141
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:21,245
Yet, the two of them went on a blind date.

142
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,413
There's a saying.

143
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:25,499
"Blind dates and car accidents
are sometimes beyond your control."

144
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,376
But you may still be partly at fault

145
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,128
by failing to keep a distance.

146
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,094
CONTRACT EXPIRATION

147
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,763
I have somewhere to be.

148
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,306
Sure, go ahead.

149
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,018
Take care of yourself, Ms. Do Do-hee.

150
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:47,730
Until we meet again,
be sure to stay away from lasers or Poro…

151
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,359
Or Pororos.

152
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,737
Bye.

153
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,121
Take notes. "Lasers or Pororo."

154
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,289
Please don't let this get out.

155
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,632
SUNWOL FOUNDATION

156
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,967
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR JEONG GU-WON

157
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,991
Hand it over.

158
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,663
"Demons exist for the sake of deals."

159
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,290
"Failure to make new deals
or to meet the expiration date

160
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,708
leads to spontaneous combus…"

161
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,128
"Spontaneous combustion"?

162
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,004
Don't go through my stuff!

163
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,507
What? I'm your employee.
We're practically family--

164
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,758
Hold on.

165
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,636
How did you find it?
I hid it where no one would find it.

166
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,263
I was just cleaning up, and…

167
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,639
Just let me have a look.

168
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:06,350
I have the right to read
the demon manual as your butler.

169
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,768
A "manual"?

170
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,270
You think I'm a vacuum cleaner?

171
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,064
So what is it then?

172
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,317
It contains all the information about me.
You could call it a manu…

173
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:16,902
A what?

174
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,489
Anyway, it's extremely important.

175
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,074
So keep away from it.

176
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,075
I mean it.

177
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:38,799
By the way,

178
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,177
does spontaneous combustion

179
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,471
mean that you'll burn away?

180
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,266
Gosh, that's scary.

181
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:48,851
How often do you need a new deal?

182
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:49,894
Weekly? Monthly?

183
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:50,895
I don't know.

184
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,897
That's why I'm even more anxious.

185
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,106
I knew it.

186
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,567
All your hard work
was really out of character for you.

187
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,568
Enough of this.

188
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,821
Look into this woman for me.

189
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,575
CEO DO DO-HEE

190
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,285
-"Do Do-hee"?
-Her family,

191
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,412
blood type, past relationships, roommates,

192
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,332
and even her most important preferences,

193
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,709
such as whether she likes
her tangsuyuk sauce on top or on the side.

194
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:18,506
Who is this woman
that you're so intrigued by her?

195
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,509
Did your date from yesterday
take your fancy?

196
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,636
-She's a thief.
-Did she steal your heart?

197
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,306
I really don't appreciate
how you're looking at me.

198
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,269
Wait, it's gone.

199
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,481
What? What's gone?

200
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:36,732
Your tattoo.

201
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,400
So that's what you meant.

202
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,652
What do you mean?

203
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:42,071
Did something else go missing?

204
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,489
No.

205
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:50,162
Come to think of it,
you somehow feel different.

206
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,581
Not at all. What do you mean?

207
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,876
-No?
-No.

208
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:58,879
All right.

209
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:14,979
Your powers are gone.

210
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,232
This is new.

211
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,400
Hold on.

212
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,860
Without your powers,
does this mean you'll burn away,

213
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,904
and I'll be out of work overnight?

214
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,824
I still have to pay for my new car!

215
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,285
Is that what you're worried about?

216
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,245
My powers are gone, for crying out loud!

217
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,373
So you did lose your powers. I was right.

218
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,500
No, I didn't lose them.

219
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,294
-It's just that…
-What?

220
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,257
I've loaned them to someone for a bit.

221
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,720
You mean to this thief? What happened?

222
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,055
I don't know.

223
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,765
Whatever she did,

224
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,934
my powers started acting up,
and my tattoo transferred to her.

225
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,186
-I need more details.
-Later.

226
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,480
Where are you off to?
To get your powers back?

227
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,858
A contract expires today.
That comes first.

228
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,860
What could you do without your powers?

229
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,155
What are you talking about? I'm a demon.

230
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,699
I've been one for the last 200 years.

231
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,951
Collecting souls
is as easy as chewing gum.

232
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,966
You can't just spit your gum anywhere.

233
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,260
Do you know how hard it is
to remove dried-up gum from…

234
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,722
What do you think? Do you like it?

235
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,557
To be honest,

236
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,851
I didn't work this hard
even for the Olympics.

237
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,645
While that was very touching,

238
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,021
it's time for a beautiful goodbye.

239
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,690
I did some research.

240
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,819
A contract demanding too much in return

241
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,279
is considered an unfair transaction.

242
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:51,241
In other words, I owe you nothing.

243
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,410
I'm sick and tired of this.

244
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,412
Humans are getting
more and more shameless.

245
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,207
You don't seem to know
who you're dealing with.

246
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,376
So I'm about to show you.

247
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,461
Come at me one by one.

248
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,046
He wants to show something. Go at him.

249
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,714
Go. Let's see what he's got.

250
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,467
I said one by one.

251
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:10,719
One by one.

252
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,887
How dare you!

253
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,099
Where's your sportsmanship?

254
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,071
Get him!

255
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,538
Didn't I already hit you?

256
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,331
Why do you all look the same?

257
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:45,963
Get out of my way.

258
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,097
I really didn't want to do this, but…

259
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,203
Just you wait.

260
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,998
I'll teach you a lesson,
so hold on to your contract.

261
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,083
Be my guest, moron.

262
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,545
Go ahead.

263
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,465
You bastard.

264
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:33,886
Don't throw that!

265
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,102
I had your damaged car scrapped

266
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:45,064
and got a new car ready.

267
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,776
He just happened to be eating alone
in that very restaurant

268
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,653
and showed up
on that coastal road that night?

269
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,531
It can't just be a coincidence.

270
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,117
I'm 100% sure that it's…

271
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,327
Fate?

272
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:03,457
I didn't know you were so romantic.

273
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,459
My apologies for being romantic.

274
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,877
He's pulling a trick.

275
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,047
He must be hovering around me,
waiting for the right moment.

276
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,006
To do what?

277
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,258
To strike a deal with me.

278
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:16,637
He was going on about a deal
when I was about to die.

279
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,806
What could it be about
to go to such lengths?

280
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,057
Exactly.

281
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,267
I doubt it's worth my time.

282
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,770
The fact that he's being
so persistent and sly

283
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,023
means that the deal
isn't beneficial to us.

284
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,527
You got a tattoo?

285
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,278
I've got to quit drinking.

286
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,324
It's only been 24 hours
since the sugar article ran,

287
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,909
and we've already dropped by 10%.

288
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,870
Foreign stockholders and institutions
are in a selling frenzy.

289
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,498
Should we head to the office?

290
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:52,005
Ju Cheon-suk is the reason
you're going to die.

291
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,300
I'd like to see Madam Ju first.

292
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,889
Detective Park, the sketch is out.

293
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,519
Look at all the details.

294
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,105
He'll get caught in no time.

295
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,302
Can I help you?

296
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,597
I've noticed that the rent
is always paid on time,

297
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,933
but I never see anyone around here.

298
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,768
I own this building.

299
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,812
May I talk to the director?

300
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,315
No, the company's on a tour.

301
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,275
I'll tell the director to call you.

302
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,110
Wait.

303
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,863
You look familiar. Are you an actor?

304
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,492
-Yes.
-When did you start here?

305
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,452
How come I never saw you?

306
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:48,247
I came back recently after a break.

307
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:53,126
I suppose you can never run away
from your calling.

308
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,587
You're right.

309
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,340
Once I got a taste, I couldn't stop.

310
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,511
My goodness.

311
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,055
Why is your hand covered in blood?

312
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,599
This? It's special effects makeup.

313
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,771
One would think
you killed a person or something.

314
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,608
Please tell the director
that I'd like a meeting.

315
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,901
Actually…

316
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,361
BLUE NIGHT THEATER

317
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,073
There's a leak in the ceiling.

318
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,993
Is it acting up again?

319
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,911
Would you mind taking a look?

320
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:41,800
PERFORMANCE IN PROGRESS
DO NOT ENTER

321
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,094
-Madam Ju.
-Hey.

322
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:45,679
Is everything done?

323
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,223
Yes, I'm all clean.

324
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,600
That's good to hear.

325
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,644
Doesn't that take a load off of your mind?

326
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,229
It wasn't too bad, was it?

327
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,231
I'd say it was a waste of time.

328
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,860
I wonder how my plant babies are doing.

329
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,987
I should hurry home and fertilize them.

330
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,405
Let me give you a lift.

331
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:04,990
Aren't you busy?

332
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:08,201
I saw that your market cap
has shrunk by 260 billion won.

333
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,453
I'm taking care of it.

334
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:10,996
Who was it?

335
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,332
I don't know yet.

336
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,083
Do you need my help?

337
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,752
Forget it.

338
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,670
I've managed just fine
on my own until now.

339
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,964
It would be frustrating
to need your help after all this time.

340
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:25,886
Madam Ju.

341
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:28,680
Come in.

342
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,310
-Ms. Ju.
-Director Choi.

343
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,187
You didn't have to come and see me off.

344
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,939
I wanted to make sure
your time here was comfortable.

345
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:40,859
My goodness.

346
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:44,237
They're all drooping already.

347
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,323
I can't tell.

348
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:47,991
How can you not tell?

349
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:52,537
All the leaves started to sag
while I was away.

350
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,959
You should rest.
Don't complain about your knees later.

351
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,588
I won't.

352
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,007
I got a whole bunch of pills.

353
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,259
Do you think painkillers
are supplements or something?

354
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,594
You take them so regularly.

355
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,805
I'll help. Just tell me what to do.

356
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,765
Forget it. You know nothing.

357
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:12,766
Just sit down.

358
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,143
You shouldn't strain your knees
in the first place.

359
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,395
All those painkillers
will catch up to you.

360
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,647
Are you addicted or what?

361
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,399
Painkillers can't be worse
than hearing you nag.

362
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:24,319
Pain is just a part of getting old.

363
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,906
I'd be worse off if I just sat still.

364
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:30,617
Oh, my.

365
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,160
Look at this bud.

366
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,204
It's so plump.

367
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,289
It's going to blossom soon.

368
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,290
How pretty.

369
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,169
I wanted to ask you something.

370
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:42,879
Ask away.

371
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:47,551
By any chance…

372
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:50,262
It's not like you to hesitate.

373
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,392
You're not hiding anything
from me, are you?

374
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,643
You bet I am.

375
00:23:56,726 --> 00:24:00,730
I have lies flowing through my veins
instead of blood.

376
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,692
Business owners can't afford to be honest.

377
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:05,944
Madam Ju.

378
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:07,654
I'm serious.

379
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,287
I'll be honest if you want me to.

380
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,206
Are you sure you're not hiding anything?

381
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,880
I'm sure.

382
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,219
Nothing gets past you anyway.

383
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,434
All right.

384
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,811
I'll take your word for it.

385
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,856
You're the only person
I can trust after all.

386
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,775
Did someone say something?

387
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,319
I just got curious.

388
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,405
You're silly.

389
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,325
Aunt Cheon-suk!

390
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:57,120
Look at you working away
right after getting discharged.

391
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,997
I told her to rest,
but she won't listen to me.

392
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,167
I failed to raise my children well,
so my plants are my only hope.

393
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,502
But everyone's been behaving lately.

394
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,547
I know. Suk-min's really
turned over a new leaf.

395
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,507
Think about his age.

396
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,634
It's about time he did.

397
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:14,137
I jumped through all sorts of hoops
to knock some sense into him.

398
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:20,477
Here's the earnings report
for the last quarter.

399
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,107
Looks good.

400
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,526
Don't just look at the results.
Appreciate the process too.

401
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,945
I worked so hard on this.

402
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,363
Do I need to?

403
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,866
She never compliments me.

404
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,035
I'll be going now.

405
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,537
I'm leaving too, Do-hee.

406
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:40,914
But you just got here.

407
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:44,292
I should hurry back to the office
and keep increasing your wealth.

408
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,044
-Are you headed to your office?
-Yes.

409
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,546
You two.

410
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,466
If work is all you have going on
in your lives,

411
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:53,009
how about you marry each other?

412
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,344
Marry each other?

413
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:55,428
Sorry?

414
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:58,765
Don't be ridiculous. What's with you?

415
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:00,141
What's so ridiculous?

416
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,103
You're not related by blood,
nor are you registered as family.

417
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,312
You're funny, Auntie.

418
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,855
Don't mind her, Seok-hoon.

419
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,108
She's dying to marry me off these days.

420
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,609
I'm off, Madam Ju.

421
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,611
God knows what you'll say
if I stay longer.

422
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,531
Fine, I guess that was a long shot.

423
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:16,199
-I'll come by again.
-Don't.

424
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,584
-Going to your office?
-Yes.

425
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,086
Do you need a lift?

426
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,713
Wait, I guess you drove here.

427
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,799
Actually, no.

428
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,260
I didn't drive here.

429
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:36,428
I took a taxi.

430
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,096
Great, let me drive you.

431
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,807
-You will?
-Let's go for a drive. It's been a while.

432
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,143
Sounds good. Let's go.

433
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,036
What's wrong? Is something bothering you?

434
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,664
No, I'm perfectly fine, Do-hee.

435
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,752
You seem comfortable, Ms. Shin.

436
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:12,339
Thank you for giving me time
to get my work done.

437
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,216
Don't mention it.

438
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,845
Shouldn't we repay Mr. Jeong Gu-won
in some way?

439
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:20,388
He paid for the meal before too.

440
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,765
We probably should.

441
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,516
I feel like I owe him.

442
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,685
Who are you talking about?

443
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:28,772
He's just some guy
I went on a blind date with.

444
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,905
Are you okay, Do-hee?

445
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:38,990
Yes, I'm okay.

446
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:45,413
Ms. Shin.

447
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:48,124
Your nose is bleeding.

448
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,668
-My goodness.
-From both…

449
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,129
Both nostrils… Hold on.

450
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,599
Are you sure you're all right, Ms. Shin?

451
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,061
I'll be fine as long as
I'm the one driving.

452
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:10,522
I'm sorry.

453
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,568
Was it that shocking
that I went on a blind date?

454
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,946
It's just that you're still young.

455
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,240
Also, it's not really like you.

456
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,450
So why did you go on a blind date?

457
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,077
Why else?

458
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,078
You want to get married?

459
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:26,996
That's not it.

460
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,832
Madam Ju begged me to.

461
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,835
I don't plan on getting married.

462
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,169
Neither do I then.

463
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:37,340
What do you mean?

464
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,927
I mean, since you don't plan
on getting married,

465
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:44,431
I'm assuming that's a trend
among young people.

466
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:47,350
Where is this from?
Kimchi? Spicy noodle soup?

467
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,018
It's from yesterday.

468
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,563
Your tie's all loose too. Let me see.

469
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,899
You look totally normal,
yet you're always a mess.

470
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,652
My parents are hippies, remember?

471
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,617
We'll try to buy

472
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,996
enough Mirae F&B shares
to offset the loss, so…

473
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,123
This is how rumors about

474
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,083
stock manipulation
and insider trading start.

475
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:15,587
Even from an investor's point of view,
buying your stocks is a good deal.

476
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,547
Don't worry.

477
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,299
I'll take care of it myself.

478
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:23,636
For a moment there,
I forgot how incredible you are.

479
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,556
And how strong you are.
You almost killed me.

480
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,061
-Let me try again.
-No, I love it.

481
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,939
Doesn't this look good, Ms. Shin?

482
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,442
Yes, very.

483
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:41,488
No wonder you're a trendsetter, Do-hee.

484
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,616
-Stop teasing me.
-I'm not.

485
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,284
I know you are! Let me try again.

486
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,578
-Hold on.
-It doesn't look right.

487
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,624
-I'll try again.
-No, it's fine.

488
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,462
I can't find anything.

489
00:29:57,545 --> 00:30:00,131
There's no mention
of tattoos getting transferred,

490
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,883
let alone how to get them back!

491
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,480
Mr. Park, did you look into Do Do-hee?

492
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,821
Name, Do Do-hee.

493
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,489
Blood type, AB.

494
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:27,408
Also known as Mirae Group's princess,
the Devil in Hermès,

495
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,910
Do Do-hee the Nutjob,

496
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,162
and the list goes on.

497
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,467
-No!
-It's the Devil!

498
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,971
We got the Devil today!

499
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,348
She's not from a chaebol family.

500
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,724
Her father was an engineer

501
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,310
who developed
metal cross bearings for electronics.

502
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,855
Her mother ran a hair salon.

503
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,566
She was their only daughter
from their late marriage.

504
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:03,236
But they passed in a car accident
on her birthday 17 years ago.

505
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,821
Do Do-hee was 11 then.

506
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:08,867
That's when Mirae Group's Chairwoman Ju
took the orphaned Do Do-hee in.

507
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,244
Chairwoman Ju
had co-founded Mirae Electronics,

508
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:13,997
the parent company of Mirae Group,
with Do-hee's father.

509
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:18,918
Those arrows remind me
of the situation our company's in.

510
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:22,755
It's like how you can relate to
every breakup song after getting dumped.

511
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:23,882
I never experienced that.

512
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,800
That's because you've never been dumped.

513
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,011
Are you saying

514
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:31,723
I'm experiencing deeper emotions
than when I broke up with my exes?

515
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:40,023
She's been working her butt off
all her life.

516
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:42,984
Always a top student,
and she even graduated from college early.

517
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,612
She started a dessert company
during college,

518
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,822
which became number one in seven years.

519
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,949
It then went on to become Mirae F&B

520
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:53,036
after it was acquired by Mirae Group.

521
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:56,706
MIRAE F&B

522
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,750
By tomorrow, our company better be…

523
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,129
going back up.

524
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:05,632
No matter what.

525
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,061
-Good morning.
-Good morning, ma'am.

526
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,271
It's not a good morning.

527
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,190
We've lost 260 billion won.

528
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:25,944
We're constantly releasing
rebuttal articles as we speak.

529
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:26,945
They're not working.

530
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:30,114
We're taking legal action against
fake news and hateful comments.

531
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,324
And neither is that.

532
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,243
How about we just wait it out?

533
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:39,415
You see, everything fades away in time.

534
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,712
-That's…
-Fresh?

535
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,589
…some flowery mumbo jumbo.

536
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,883
He majored in liberal arts.

537
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,885
Enter a writing contest, why don't you?

538
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:53,596
You wouldn't win though.

539
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,140
I'm sorry.

540
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,518
Do you know why
the dinosaurs went extinct?

541
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:00,770
As I majored in natural sciences,

542
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:02,355
I can answer that very well.

543
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:05,608
There was a catastrophic collision
between Earth and a comet.

544
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:22,500
Their performance
didn't live up to their size.

545
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,421
That's why they went extinct.

546
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,636
I have Ms. Noh Su-ahn's schedule.

547
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:39,434
Don't try to deal with problems
after they happen.

548
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,601
Be on the offense.

549
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,771
I'll have this mess cleaned up
by the one who made it.

550
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,651
She's single at the moment.

551
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,194
Her past relationships

552
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,655
didn't last long because she was too busy.

553
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,574
And about tangsuyuk…

554
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,035
Sauce on top!

555
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,996
What? The sauce should go on the side!

556
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,000
But that's hardly the issue right now.

557
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:08,963
I'll drive there myself,
so talk to the legal team and fill me in.

558
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,089
Let me drive you.

559
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:14,218
Didn't you say my word was law?

560
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,596
I shouldn't have let you
go alone yesterday.

561
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,311
I was just unlucky.

562
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:26,022
It was neither your fault nor mine.

563
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:28,357
-Still--
-I don't want to become a weak person

564
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:31,652
who blames myself and those around me.

565
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,113
That would mean that creep got to me.

566
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:38,785
And we can't have that.

567
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,680
I need to stay strong.

568
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,355
That's all I know for now.

569
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,815
So what's your plan?

570
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,659
I'm going to do what I'm best at.

571
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,327
Which is?

572
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,163
Bewitching…

573
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:26,749
humans.

574
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:37,426
You look gorgeous, ma'am.

575
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,721
Mirae F&B must be in chaos right now.

576
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,348
How big was their loss again?

577
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,851
The market closed at just under 20%.

578
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,936
Poor Do-hee.

579
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,565
One news article can be so powerful.

580
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,401
Should I send her some flowers
to comfort her?

581
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,945
No need. It's the thought that counts.

582
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,740
What are you doing here?

583
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,411
What else? I'm shopping.

584
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,164
Do you really have
the leisure to shop around?

585
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:11,878
You shop with money, not with leisure.

586
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:19,594
Being the CEO of Mirae Apparel,

587
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,180
you sure have a better eye
for clothes than for men.

588
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,871
What's with the show
in front of all the employees?

589
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:50,249
I was just worried about you.

590
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,751
You, worried about me?

591
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:54,253
Stock prices can always rebound,

592
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:56,756
but once your private life is exposed,

593
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:57,882
you're doomed.

594
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,384
What private life?

595
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,471
One would think I was up to some wild…

596
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,643
You're not the only one
who's interested in me.

597
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:09,936
I'm interested in you too.

598
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,942
I made sure to cover my tracks.

599
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,401
How did you even…

600
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,779
I spent more money than you did.

601
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,324
Falling in love isn't a crime,

602
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:27,828
but doing this in public is.

603
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,288
Are you blackmailing me?

604
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:30,998
No way.

605
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,417
I haven't even begun.

606
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:37,546
Excuse me.

607
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,510
-Hello?
-Where are you?

608
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,513
-Jeong Gu-won?
-Can we meet?

609
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,974
I'm feeling seriously unwell
since the accident.

610
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,809
How unwell?

611
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,978
To the extent
that it affects my livelihood.

612
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,397
You seemed fine earlier.

613
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,984
See for yourself if you don't believe me.

614
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,403
Come to the Daehyeon Department Store
in Jamsil.

615
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,406
I don't have much time for you.
I won't wait long.

616
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,952
I'm the one running out of time.

617
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:14,333
Sorry about that.

618
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,425
Listen up, Su-ahn.

619
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:23,926
Here comes the blackmail.

620
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:29,265
Once your steamy private life
gets publicized,

621
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:32,184
the brand image of Mirae Apparel
will hit rock bottom.

622
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,394
It doesn't end there.

623
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,479
Madam Ju's going to blow her top.

624
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,440
Don't you say a word to her.

625
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,567
Or else you'll regret it.

626
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,610
Too bad.

627
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,612
There are no secrets between me and her.

628
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:49,577
Then how about this?

629
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:55,958
You clean up the mess you made.

630
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:59,837
And I'll keep
the inconvenient truth a secret.

631
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,839
Some things

632
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,924
are better left unknown, right?

633
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,471
I advise you not to waste
your energy on me.

634
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,432
If you want a war,

635
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,642
go play with your brother.

636
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,369
Father.

637
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:33,829
I can't…

638
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,500
go to heaven, can I?

639
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:41,837
But there is…

640
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,966
something I fear more…

641
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,430
than going to hell.

642
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,017
I'm afraid of…

643
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,438
not receiving her forgiveness.

644
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:05,277
Your own mind is keeping you in hell.

645
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,572
It's time you confessed the truth

646
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,117
and freed yourself.

647
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:14,787
The truth…

648
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:22,920
MY DARLING DAUGHTER DO-HEE

649
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,955
I wonder if Director Jeong made his move.

650
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,918
I trust him completely

651
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,753
when it comes to bewitching humans.

652
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,175
I myself fell for him not once but twice.

653
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:21,604
I thought the last thing I smelled
would be incense,

654
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,565
but I'm smelling burning charcoal instead.

655
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:45,085
Customers were so hard to come by,

656
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,046
but here I get the Grim Reaper so easily.

657
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:52,384
Welcome!

658
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,311
Jesus?

659
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:04,688
Nope, not that one.

660
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,399
Then?

661
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,488
SOUL SALES AGREEMENT

662
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,198
KING OF HELL TTEOKBOKKI
FRANCHISE GUIDE

663
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,574
So you're saying

664
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:18,202
all I need to do
is put my thumbprint on this?

665
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:20,913
Yes. Then the entire franchise
with 2,000 locations

666
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:23,082
will be all yours.

667
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,377
It's no biggie.

668
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,629
Hell can't be worse
than living as a small business owner.

669
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,297
I'll do it. Give me an ink pad.

670
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:35,886
What are you doing?

671
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,265
It hurts!

672
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,396
It hurts!

673
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:47,273
The deal will last for ten years.

674
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,316
And you will never go hungry
in that period

675
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,318
since that is your wish.

676
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,660
What happens afterward?

677
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,999
Your body will die,

678
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,294
and your soul
will end up where I come from.

679
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,170
What kind of place is that?

680
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,006
You humans seem to call it…

681
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:17,344
hell.

682
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:19,888
Why is everything red?

683
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:23,475
What's going on?

684
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,607
I didn't only eat fish!

685
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,108
I also ate meat!

686
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,901
You damn devil!

687
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:34,737
You devil!

688
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,821
Hold on.

689
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,040
You damn devil.

690
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:51,378
Do you know what I've been through
because of you?

691
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,630
Hold on.

692
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:55,674
-Wait!
-You damn bastard!

693
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:56,925
Because of you…

694
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,344
-For ten years…
-Stop!

695
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,220
Hey, stop!

696
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,514
I'll drag you to hell myself, you devil!

697
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,560
Why doesn't it make any sound?

698
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:08,562
Do I need more water?

699
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,321
Any human being with desires

700
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:20,407
would have no choice
but to fall for Director Jeong.

701
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:21,825
Hold on.

702
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:25,371
But how is he going to bewitch her
without his powers?

703
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,083
Why did he lose his powers?

704
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,418
Because his tattoo
transferred to that woman, and…

705
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:41,637
Tell me everything.

706
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:44,056
What happened to Director Jeong?

707
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:45,724
Yes, ma'am.

708
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,396
Where is he?

709
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:52,106
He said he was out front.

710
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:56,318
He must be trying to trick me
by using his health as an excuse.

711
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:58,278
I'm going to settle things once and…

712
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:50,873
Look at you.

713
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:52,583
You said you were seriously unwell,

714
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,251
but you're practically
glowing with health.

715
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,253
You think I'm glowing?

716
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:00,048
Anyway,

717
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:02,426
I feel like I owe you

718
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:04,553
since you paid for the meal and whatnot.

719
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:06,305
It's a little something.

720
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,057
Didn't I say I don't need this?

721
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,267
I hate being indebted.

722
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,311
Forget it. I have as much money as…

723
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,106
Still no?

724
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,150
…as you do.

725
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,905
Then what do you want from me?

726
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:25,491
You even lied to me about your health.

727
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:27,618
If this is about that deal again--

728
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:28,911
That's over.

729
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,413
There's no need for deals between us now.

730
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,123
Between us?

731
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,958
My symptoms are real.

732
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,503
They're so serious
that it's affecting my livelihood.

733
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,379
What are your symptoms?

734
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,547
I can't do anything.

735
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,425
I'm extremely lethargic,
and I feel like a different person.

736
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:46,512
I've never felt this way before.

737
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,223
You should see a psychiatrist.

738
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,933
-Why would you come to me for--
-No.

739
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,353
Only you can solve my problems.

740
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,449
Because you're the reason for my symptoms.

741
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:32,891
Let me get something straight.

742
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,352
I'm only spending time with you

743
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:37,312
to help you recover as a kind gesture.

744
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,106
This isn't a date or anything.

745
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:41,984
Give me your hand.

746
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:45,571
You like to take things fast, don't you?

747
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,159
The other hand.

748
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:05,882
What are you doing?

749
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,175
We're going for a drive.

750
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:28,280
I can't believe that moron

751
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,033
had the nerve to show up here all alone.

752
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:32,618
He's a loan shark, right?

753
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,996
Where did you spend
all of your Olympic medalist pension?

754
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,041
Don't you even ask.

755
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,669
Do you know any nice bars?
Let's go grab a drink.

756
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,005
Drinking, smoking, womanizing…

757
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:48,675
How are you a top athlete
while indulging in all those taboos?

758
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,677
Geniuses don't have to work hard.

759
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,847
I'm just on a different level than you.

760
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:55,349
Of course.

761
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:58,268
You can never beat a natural.

762
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:27,506
-What the hell?
-What an idiot.

763
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:29,925
Did he want to feel better about himself?

764
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:31,843
-Du-hwan!
-Du-hwan!

765
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:33,345
-Du-hwan!
-Du-hwan!

766
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:42,437
AHN DU-HWAN

767
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:56,159
What just…

768
00:49:57,577 --> 00:49:59,162
What just happened?

769
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,706
They're my friends.

770
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,252
How many more of your friends
will I be meeting tonight?

771
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,087
I want to mentally prepare myself.

772
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,547
I don't do friends.

773
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:12,134
Anyway, can we cut to the chase now?

774
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:14,428
What do you mean?

775
00:50:33,029 --> 00:50:34,489
Let's try something here.

776
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:36,658
Here?

777
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:45,041
I'm not an old-fashioned person myself,

778
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,460
but this is our first time.

779
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,755
And doing it in public is frowned upon by…

780
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:52,299
What?

781
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:54,259
Where is he going?

782
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,721
Oh, my goodness.

783
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:14,279
Come on out. We're doing it outside.

784
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:15,947
Outside?

785
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:19,785
That's a crime.

786
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:21,328
The crime of public indecency.

787
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,622
You may face up to one year in prison
or a fine of up to five million…

788
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:28,585
When did they criminalize
a stroll by the river?

789
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,141
A stroll.

790
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:53,568
Don't get me wrong.
It was the timing of it all.

791
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,947
I'm usually not one
to get ahead of myself.

792
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,536
Can you…

793
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,582
hold your breath for a bit?

794
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:13,255
Hold my breath? Why?

795
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:19,511
This is it.

796
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:20,762
He's going in for a kiss.

797
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:52,377
Come back. Please come back to me.

798
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:14,190
So this wasn't it?

799
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,425
What was that for? I almost died!

800
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:43,345
-Calm down.
-How can I calm down?

801
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:45,513
Do you know how many times
I almost died today?

802
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:48,767
I almost drowned twice because of you!

803
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,018
And it doesn't end there!

804
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:51,603
Some lunatic's trying to kill me,

805
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:54,898
and I don't even know
who he is or why he wants me dead!

806
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:58,318
Why are you all doing this to me?

807
00:53:58,401 --> 00:53:59,819
What did I do so wrong?

808
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:07,911
Why did you do that?

809
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,498
I wanted to check something.

810
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:14,125
Then you should've told me beforehand.

811
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:15,752
If I had told you,

812
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:17,671
you would've refused.

813
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:22,384
Scumbag.

814
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:42,654
I owe you nothing.

815
00:55:06,302 --> 00:55:08,888
If that wasn't it,
then how do I get it back?

816
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,560
What the hell are you doing here?

817
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:17,897
I was spying on Do Do-hee
like you told me to.

818
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,320
Finders keepers.
Don't even think about it.

819
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:27,824
Anyway, what's going on?

820
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:30,577
I thought you were going to bewitch her,
not take a dip with her.

821
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,870
Be quiet.

822
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:06,279
Is this Ms. Do Do-hee?

823
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:09,157
I'm Cha Tae-jun,
the head of Mirae Group's financial team.

824
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:12,035
All I can tell you right now

825
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:15,330
is that it has the power
to make you chairwoman of Mirae Group.

826
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:58,248
CEO DO DO-HEE

827
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:14,556
DO DO-HEE

828
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,746
Thy kingdom come.

829
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:42,625
Thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven.

830
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:45,628
Lord, give me courage.

831
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:49,090
Give me the courage to face the truth.

832
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:32,425
BOMBOM MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC

833
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:33,843
Pretty, isn't it?

834
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:35,762
Would you like one yourself?

835
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:47,565
I'll wire you right now.

836
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,609
Make sure to issue a correction.

837
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,486
Just do as I say!

838
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:54,822
I have the right to take down
the article I published, don't I?

839
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:57,075
Do Do-hee.

840
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,744
I'm going to kill you.

841
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:07,335
MIRAE F&B FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CEO: DO DO-HEE

842
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:53,548
FINANCIAL CHIEF MANAGER OF CONGLOMERATE
MR. CHA FOUND HANGING IN PUBLIC BATHROOM

843
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:06,644
Salvation takes place
in the aftermath of destruction,

844
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:10,607
when the familiar world around me
comes crashing down,

845
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,692
and what used to be normal

846
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:16,195
is no longer normal.

847
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:25,682
This man

848
01:01:26,974 --> 01:01:28,726
came crashing into my precarious life.

849
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:34,065
A man who is more unfamiliar
and suspicious than anyone.

850
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,526
Gu-won, my salvation.

851
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:30,204
It's highly likely
that they're targeting you.

852
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:31,289
Is there anyone you suspect?

853
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:32,999
I can't think of anyone
who would resent me enough to do this.

854
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:34,125
You'll have to pay for what you've done.

855
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:35,251
You're going to be my bodyguard.

856
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:37,545
Are you telling me to protect
some insignificant human?

857
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:39,005
What would happen to your tattoo
if I died?

858
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:40,965
Get in front of me. I'll watch your back.

859
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:42,925
How's the security here?

860
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:45,094
Is it that hard to keep yourself safe?

861
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:47,180
Just be her bodyguard
if you're so worried.

862
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:48,806
My tattoo is safe on that woman's wrist.

863
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:50,016
He saved me again.

864
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,976
The situation might not be too bad.

865
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:53,102
Do you smell something burning?

866
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:54,479
The spontaneous combustion

867
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:55,897
has begun.

868
