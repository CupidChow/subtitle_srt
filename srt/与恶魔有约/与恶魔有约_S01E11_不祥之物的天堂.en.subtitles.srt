1
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,311
I didn't know…

2
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,523
that was possible.

3
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,375
How…

4
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:08,962
Do-hee!

5
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:19,681
Do-hee.

6
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,146
The tattoo…

7
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,025
has come back to me.

8
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:06,978
EPISODE 11
A PARADISE OF THE OMINOUS

9
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,505
Now that's what I'm talking about.

10
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:38,593
The perfect life of a demon
who looks down at insignificant humans.

11
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:41,095
The leisure that only
an apex predator can enjoy.

12
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,266
It's nice to finally be back
to my perfect self!

13
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,562
I'm incredible as usual.

14
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,232
Yet humans are as insignificant as ever.

15
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,233
Seriously.

16
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,486
So you're back to your old self.

17
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,488
Do-hee! I told you not to move around.

18
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,698
You might injure yourself.

19
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,408
I can't be lying down all day.

20
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,077
I have to get to work.

21
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,994
Who cares about work?

22
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,913
Are you obsessed with work or something?

23
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,374
This is called a sense of responsibility.

24
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,669
I have a lot on my shoulders
as the CEO of my company.

25
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:14,921
What are you doing?

26
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,513
Car accidents are not to be taken lightly.

27
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,891
They may have lasting impacts
even after you think you've recovered.

28
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,604
I'm really fine.

29
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,314
You've healed me completely.

30
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,691
Don't you trust your powers?

31
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,567
That's not it.

32
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,861
It's just

33
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,864
that I almost lost you for good.

34
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,495
We almost lost each other.

35
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,250
I'll be late.

36
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,461
Be careful!

37
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,171
-Do Do-hee!
-I'm fine!

38
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,674
Dodo!

39
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:00,842
Let's see here.

40
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,052
What should I wear?

41
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:07,640
Thanks.

42
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,685
Which bag…

43
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,061
Hold on.

44
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,271
Take the black one.

45
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,564
Sure.

46
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,066
You should get ready too.

47
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,318
We don't have much time.

48
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,278
Only if my powers weren't back.

49
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,075
Jeong Gu-won!

50
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:34,542
This outfit symbolizes
my perfect rebirth as a flawless being.

51
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,919
-What do you think?
-It's perfect.

52
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,881
It's so flawlessly obnoxious.

53
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,632
You think so?

54
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:45,928
How about now?

55
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,223
Goodness, are you performing
at a nightclub later?

56
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,729
Looking good, maestro.

57
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,439
Here's a standing ovation for you.

58
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,067
You're amazing, Jeong Gu-won!

59
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,235
Then you pick out my outfit.

60
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,738
Okay. One second.

61
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:07,742
This looks good.

62
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,452
What do you think?

63
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,122
Got it.

64
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,106
Why aren't you saying anything?

65
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:39,899
Because…

66
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,360
I don't need to.

67
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,487
Let's wear matching outfits.

68
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,072
No way.

69
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,698
It's not my thing.

70
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,420
Turns out I love matching outfits.

71
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,173
Should we get going?

72
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,383
-Let's go.
-Okay.

73
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,471
Why are we walking?

74
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,559
You said you'd walk with me
if the world were to end tomorrow.

75
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,437
-We have to stop by somewhere too.
-We'll be late.

76
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,729
Don't worry about that.

77
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,731
We'll be at work
at the snap of my fingers.

78
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,526
I almost forgot.
This is the life of a demon.

79
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,237
Yes. And let me know if you need anything.

80
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,406
Everything is a piece of cake for me.

81
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,452
What?

82
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,661
Wait for me, Do-hee.

83
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:34,912
Hurry up.

84
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,917
Look. You didn't expect to see
the two of us together again, did you?

85
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,342
Are you bragging right now?

86
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,969
I'm rubbing it in.

87
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:50,970
I can hear you.

88
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,722
Just say it to my face.

89
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,933
How do you feel
about this unexpected anomaly?

90
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,810
I'm surprised.

91
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,020
Congratulations.

92
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,148
Hold on.

93
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,984
I don't think you have a knack for it.
Here's a billion won.

94
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,652
Quit gambling and start saving up.

95
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,780
Don't forget.

96
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:10,865
I won.

97
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,788
How exactly do you know her?

98
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,332
She's my boss.

99
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,541
What?

100
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,338
It's ten won, damn it.

101
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,797
Don't mind her.

102
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:27,924
Is she really?

103
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,306
MIRAE F&B

104
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,352
-Good morn--
-Good morning indeed.

105
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,521
It'll be yet another insignificant day,

106
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,772
but have a good one.

107
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,863
He seems to be in a good mood today.

108
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,240
You're right.

109
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,449
He's glowing.

110
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,993
When is he not?

111
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,161
You're right.

112
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,579
He's always glowing.

113
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,094
Why are you two being so awkward?

114
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,054
What do you mean?

115
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,515
We're just being polite.

116
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,857
I'll be busy all day
finishing up the work from yesterday.

117
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,991
What's this? Is it for me?

118
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,200
Do you like it?

119
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,953
It's my birthday cake.

120
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,416
Right.

121
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,045
Make a wish.

122
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,880
I don't need to

123
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,799
because I can do anything now.

124
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,319
Maybe it's the 200-year-old in you.
This is a bit old-fashioned.

125
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,655
I didn't know
it'd feel this nice to have a birthday.

126
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,574
Congratulations, Demon 2.0.

127
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:17,908
Demon what?

128
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,368
You've been upgraded.

129
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,662
You don't flicker
or need to charge up anymore.

130
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:24,290
What am I, a robot vacuum?

131
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,083
Also,

132
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,418
I still need to charge up.

133
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,046
We can't eat the cake like this.

134
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,258
Like I said, I can do anything.

135
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,600
-It's good.
-Is it?

136
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:43,517
Try it.

137
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,810
Here, 2.0.

138
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,856
-Good, isn't it?
-Yes.

139
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,119
So they survived that fiery pit?

140
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,800
-The Perilla Seeds and Scallions!
-The Perilla Seeds and Scallions!

141
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:20,304
-The Perilla Seeds and Scallions!
-The Perilla Seeds and Scallions!

142
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,222
Halt!

143
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,892
Hello, boss!

144
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,560
-Hello, boss!
-Hello, boss!

145
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,937
I'm not your…

146
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,564
I have a task for you.

147
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,149
If you fail,

148
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,945
I forbid you to show up
in front of me ever again.

149
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,573
I am your boss.

150
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:43,369
Who knew you'd manage to find him?

151
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,537
We're quite capable.

152
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,163
Hold on, boss.

153
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,666
I almost forgot.

154
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,465
My trypophobia!

155
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,259
Boss.

156
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,845
It's perilla seeds and scallions.

157
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,974
I see.

158
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,475
It's beautiful.

159
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,685
Thank you, boss!

160
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,311
-Thank you, boss!
-Thank you, boss!

161
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,479
My ears are ringing.

162
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,940
He must be feeling shy.

163
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,817
-Boss!
-Boss!

164
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,373
"Transfer of ownership"?

165
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,924
Sunwol Foundation is mine now.

166
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,343
You've had your eye on my company
all this time, haven't you?

167
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,263
Now I know
why you've been hanging out in my office.

168
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,514
That's right.

169
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,809
I've been looking forward to
your spontaneous combustion.

170
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,687
What kind of demon plans to die?

171
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,856
My car payments aren't my only problem.

172
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,567
I even took out huge loans
to buy my apartment.

173
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,528
Don't you dare die
until I pay off all my debts.

174
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,156
You get your way out when you die,

175
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,365
but what about the performance?

176
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,243
It's not that simple
to transfer ownership either.

177
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,163
There's a ton of paperwork to go through.

178
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:12,249
Imagine how tiring that'll be

179
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,502
and how much it'll break my heart.

180
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,714
Stop crying.

181
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,383
Anyway, from now on,

182
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,093
you're a mere figurehead.

183
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:29,934
My Sunwol Foundation!

184
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,102
I applaud your sense of ownership.

185
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,190
So what on earth happened?

186
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,192
How did you get the tattoo back?

187
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,194
What are you talking about? I'm a demon.

188
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,154
There's nothing a demon can't do!

189
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,076
You're really back.

190
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,745
You're completely back
to your obnoxious self.

191
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,335
But how did you know my tattoo came back?

192
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,753
Star Jin told me.

193
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,510
-Where are you going?
-I have to make a deal.

194
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,225
Everything's back to normal now.

195
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,524
Director Jeong.

196
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,447
What's wrong, Star Jin?

197
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,200
Why is he so upset?

198
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:41,005
Let me introduce
Mirae F&B's much anticipated new product.

199
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:44,383
This drink doubles as a hangover cure

200
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,761
and is scheduled to launch
just before Christmas.

201
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:51,599
We're working on a promotion strategy
targeting workers in their 20s and 30s.

202
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,809
Even though times have changed,

203
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,563
many workers are still forced
to go for drinks with their superiors

204
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:58,647
day in and day out.

205
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,316
That's right.

206
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,776
And when you get drunk
at an unwanted team dinner,

207
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,613
you always end up
chewing out your superior

208
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,449
and humiliating yourself.

209
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,873
Do you forget your manners
and black out whenever you drink?

210
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,792
Hey!

211
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,586
You better get your act together!

212
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,880
Get it together, will you?

213
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:27,051
Do Do-hee! Get your act together.

214
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:31,305
I'm on fire today.

215
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:35,059
Let's have a fourth round, everyone!

216
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,856
If that sounds familiar,

217
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,193
I present to you
our new anti-hangover drink,

218
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,321
-Ultra Santa X!
-X!

219
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,160
-Santa X!
-X!

220
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,627
-Ms. Shin.
-Yes?

221
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,296
What's…

222
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,590
on the schedule for today?

223
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:07,883
Today,

224
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,260
you're very busy.

225
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,389
-Should we get going?
-Yes.

226
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,771
I've never seen Ms. Do

227
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,524
at a loss for words like that.

228
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,443
I'm more surprised
to see Ms. Shin so flustered.

229
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,613
It must mean that we did a good…
No, an amazing job!

230
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:30,614
Amazing job?

231
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,492
This calls for a team dinner.

232
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,244
What are we having?

233
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,956
-What are you in the mood for?
-Homemade food.

234
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:39,873
Homemade food?

235
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,376
Let me see.

236
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,545
Where can we get some good homemade food?

237
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,588
-My place.
-Your place?

238
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,299
Then shall we have a team dinner
at her place today?

239
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,260
That's a good idea.

240
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:10,863
It's been so long.

241
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:28,881
Found you.

242
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,803
If only she could recognize me just once.

243
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,264
That's all I could ever wish for.

244
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,142
I'll grant your wish.

245
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,189
Who are you?

246
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,565
I'm a demon.

247
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:49,068
In other words, you just hit the jackpot.

248
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,569
Hold on a second.

249
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,197
I haven't said that line in forever.

250
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,075
A demon?

251
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,827
Yes, I can make your wish come true.

252
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,871
In return, make a deal with me.

253
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:04,583
The terms are that
you will go to hell in ten years.

254
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,004
Please bring me my husband.

255
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,298
Honey.

256
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,050
You're up.

257
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,469
Sir.

258
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,597
Where's my husband?

259
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,850
Please look for him.

260
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,269
I'd like to see him

261
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,271
one last time before I die.

262
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,023
Come on.

263
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,775
I'm right here.

264
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,444
Why can't you recognize me?

265
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,076
Alzheimer's?

266
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:43,247
She doesn't remember
the current version of me.

267
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:47,459
She only remembers me
from when I was young

268
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,670
and asks for him all day long.

269
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,798
I feel so sorry for her.

270
00:18:55,843 --> 00:19:00,597
Can you really grant my wish?

271
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,349
Of course.

272
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,184
Let's do it right now.

273
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,353
But she doesn't have much time left.

274
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:10,357
Is a few minutes of reunion
really worth going to hell?

275
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,734
There's something

276
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,988
I must tell her when she recognizes me.

277
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,916
It was crazy enough to grant a wish
before signing a deal just one time.

278
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,397
Honey.

279
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,358
Where have you been all this time?

280
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,487
Where else?

281
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,532
I've been next to you the whole time.

282
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,286
Then why couldn't I see you?

283
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,455
Exactly.

284
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:08,916
Why couldn't you see me?

285
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,045
I've always been by your side.

286
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,674
I had no idea.

287
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:22,346
I thought you had abandoned me.

288
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,849
Of course not.

289
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,687
I can't live without you.

290
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,147
Don't say that.

291
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,943
You should go on with your life
even when I'm gone.

292
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,947
Even if you can't see me,

293
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:44,952
I'll always be by your side.

294
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:47,955
Do you understand?

295
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,457
I understand.

296
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,002
Let's meet again.

297
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:59,508
Please don't forget me.

298
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:04,930
I won't.

299
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,557
I'll always remember you,

300
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,352
even after you're gone.

301
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,232
Am I…

302
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,068
crying?

303
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,815
I wasn't crying.

304
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,319
I was just…

305
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,321
sweating.

306
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,114
I was sweating out of my eyes.

307
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:08,577
I've never once teared up for the
past 200 years, even when I yawned.

308
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,370
So there's no way I was crying.

309
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:12,998
Also,

310
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,334
trading a couple of minutes for ten years

311
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,753
is against business ethics.

312
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,299
Why do humans wear out so fast?

313
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,760
How insignificant.

314
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:31,349
Where are some evil humans
who deserve to go to hell?

315
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,238
You're here.

316
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:46,990
Did you make a deal?

317
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,117
No luck today.

318
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,705
All right.

319
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,582
Should we go catch them now?

320
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:56,500
Catch who?

321
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,168
The real culprit.

322
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:01,379
They should be punished
for breaking the peace treaty first.

323
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,757
Welcome back, Do Do-hee.

324
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,717
You're being haughty like your name.

325
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,514
Where should we begin?

326
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:11,598
Sokcho.

327
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,475
The culprit knew we were in Sokcho.

328
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,353
Someone leaked our information.

329
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:19,356
It's always the confidant that betrays
the main character for money.

330
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,149
We should start with our inner circle.

331
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,485
The people who knew we were in Sokcho

332
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,904
were Seok-hoon and Ms. Jin.

333
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,322
So did Mr. Park and…

334
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,284
I'm leaving.

335
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,161
Thank you for today.

336
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,833
And that woman.

337
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,417
She's the most suspicious of all.

338
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:41,753
She would never…

339
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,798
do such a thing.

340
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:46,883
What's with her?

341
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,845
Just look at the way she behaves.

342
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:50,846
Do you see that?

343
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,056
She's our prime suspect.

344
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,411
It doesn't get more suspicious than that.

345
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,580
Nothing's for sure.
Let's not jump to conclusions.

346
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:17,873
She would never…

347
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:22,794
Who's that?

348
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,589
What is he carrying?

349
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,632
An apple box hints at bribery.

350
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,470
I know humans weren't to be trusted,

351
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,181
but who knew she'd do that?

352
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,974
I still trust…

353
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,936
How could she…

354
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,480
No, that can't be. Right?

355
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,066
But still, this is obvious, isn't it?

356
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,235
The apple box and everything!
This isn't right!

357
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,446
Calm down, Do-hee.

358
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:52,032
Let's go get her.

359
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,247
Hold on.

360
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,416
We need proof.

361
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:04,002
I'll swoop down on the guy first.

362
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,561
Mr. Park?

363
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,733
What the…

364
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,109
I mean…

365
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,952
YOU'RE A STAR, MS. SHIN
A STAR IN MY HEART

366
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:44,209
I mean, why would you be
so secretive about a cake?

367
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,877
We weren't being secretive.

368
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:47,671
We were just shy.

369
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,006
What about the apple box?

370
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:54,261
I wanted a box that was big enough
for my feelings for her.

371
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,640
What on earth did we miss?

372
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:03,270
Remember when you asked me
to take Ms. Shin home when she got drunk?

373
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,939
Well, she wouldn't tell me her address.

374
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,023
So…

375
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,652
Tell me exactly where you live.

376
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,821
You're a kind man.

377
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,991
-I'm just following Director Jeong's…
-You're also responsible.

378
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:16,992
You've got to be kidding me.

379
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,452
You look cute when you smile.

380
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:21,288
Ms. Shin!

381
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:22,747
When did you…

382
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:23,790
Ms. Shin.

383
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,166
Your nose is bleeding.

384
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,344
You're the one for me.

385
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:41,224
Fork-gyu.

386
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,197
A bloody kiss.

387
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,743
Brought together by an irresistible fate,

388
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:02,162
we spent the night passionately…

389
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,123
That's enough. Spare me the details.

390
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,959
I don't want to know too much
about my family's private life.

391
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,462
Your family?

392
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,255
Ms. Shin.

393
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,923
You said you were lukewarm.

394
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:17,093
I happened to find that attractive.

395
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:21,264
I'm sorry for everything.

396
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,349
Why are you apologizing?

397
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:25,393
Falling in love isn't a crime, is it?

398
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,937
If you're so confident,
why were you being so suspicious?

399
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,065
I'm not confident.

400
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:33,568
All my past relationships
have left me ashamed.

401
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:34,986
Ms. Shin.

402
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,907
By the way,
have you been following me in a car?

403
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,285
Yes. Why?

404
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:45,705
Wouldn't it have been more convenient
to use your powers?

405
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,625
If I had used my powers,
we could've ended up in your back seat

406
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,335
or trunk… Hold on.

407
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:51,544
What?

408
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,214
That caught me off guard.

409
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,049
How do you know everything about me?

410
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,551
Did you tell her everything?

411
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,095
Did you?

412
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,846
Well, love has no secrets.

413
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:05,809
Ms. Do.

414
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:09,187
I'd appreciate it
if you could keep it a secret at work.

415
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:11,147
Ms. Shin.

416
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,113
We were totally wrong.

417
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,865
I knew Ms. Shin would never betray me.

418
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,284
"How can she do this to me?"

419
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,537
Guess who said that.

420
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,374
I have no idea.

421
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,127
The answer is

422
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,295
Do Do-hee

423
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,548
Should we get going?

424
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,849
What an unproductive day.

425
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:53,982
What are you doing?

426
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,819
We can't let them outdo us.

427
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,115
My goodness.

428
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,869
Are you crazy?

429
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,293
I am crazy about you.

430
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,464
Go away!

431
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,381
Hey!

432
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,180
Go away!

433
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,323
Wolsim!

434
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,577
I would rather forget myself…

435
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:51,372
than forget you.

436
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,056
What?

437
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:51,641
What is this?

438
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,477
Why do I keep dreaming
about when I was human?

439
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,188
And why can't I see the face
of the woman called Wolsim?

440
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,358
Is this what they call
manipulative editing?

441
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,819
One question at a time. I can't follow.

442
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,863
Why am I still dreaming
of when I was human

443
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,156
when my powers have returned?

444
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,491
Let me guess.

445
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,993
Perhaps…

446
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,246
you want to remain a human.

447
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,749
You don't want to lose the human emotions

448
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,501
that you've been experiencing.

449
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,086
Then what's with the editing?

450
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,755
Do you think I'm responsible for that?

451
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,549
Didn't I tell you?

452
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:27,510
I may set the basic rules,
but humans create anomalies

453
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,596
by disobeying the rules,
just like you did.

454
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,849
You must have erased

455
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:37,186
the memories of that woman
because they tormented you.

456
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:41,399
It's the human instinct
of self-preservation.

457
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:42,650
A defense mechanism.

458
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,777
The memories tormented me?

459
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,738
Why?

460
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:49,032
How should I know when even you don't?

461
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:49,949
You're wrong.

462
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,410
I don't have human instincts,

463
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:53,870
nor do I want to remain human.

464
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,415
Two people entangled in fate

465
00:31:57,498 --> 00:32:00,710
are meant to be reunited
in one way or another.

466
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:04,172
Because fate always repeats itself.

467
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,385
I'm here to see Do-hee.

468
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,602
An investment agreement?

469
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,105
I wish to fund Mirae F&B's expansion

470
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,857
into the Americas.

471
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,776
I appreciate the gesture,

472
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,653
but I'd rather not owe you anything.

473
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:52,989
That's a shame.

474
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:54,699
I really wanted to help.

475
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,961
I found this in my mother's belongings.

476
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,297
Would you at least take this?

477
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,635
Do you already have a copy?

478
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,346
No.

479
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:25,146
My mother cared deeply about your parents.

480
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:28,900
She was devastated
when your father left the company.

481
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:33,237
We've had our moments of conflict
following the cruel turn of events,

482
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,449
but I stand by my words
that I consider you family.

483
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,626
Let's resolve our past conflicts

484
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,878
and work together from now on.

485
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,590
You have a guest.

486
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:57,678
I suppose an unwelcome guest
is a guest all the same.

487
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:02,975
You're part of the family now,
but I don't know how to address you.

488
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,060
In that case,

489
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,814
you can call me bro.

490
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,070
See you again.

491
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,155
Not up for it?

492
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:21,911
What was he doing here?

493
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:23,830
Who knows?

494
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:25,915
Don't mind him.

495
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,888
So it's back.

496
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,328
Mom…

497
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,455
Dad…

498
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:09,917
Mom!

499
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,254
Don't you know how to knock?

500
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,549
What were you looking at?

501
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,427
Nothing.

502
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,056
Why would you peep like a little rat?

503
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,725
I can't sleep.

504
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,814
Just so you know.

505
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,443
Me neither.

506
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,285
It's hot!

507
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:31,374
Wait for it to cool down.

508
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,251
You're an impatient one.

509
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,215
It's hot!

510
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,143
It's my family.

511
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,938
But you're not in it.

512
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:37,690
I'm…

513
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,234
here in my mom's tummy.

514
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,280
The day my parents passed away

515
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:49,076
was my 11th birthday.

516
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:53,831
I was especially
looking forward to that day

517
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,334
because my dad

518
00:38:56,417 --> 00:39:00,421
had promised me a birthday party
that I'd never forget.

519
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,841
I was excited for days.

520
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,595
But on my birthday,
my dad suddenly had to go to work,

521
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,097
although he'd quit a long time ago.

522
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,808
I couldn't understand.

523
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,935
Being a little kid,

524
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,313
I cried and threw a tantrum.

525
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,900
If you go now, I'll never see you again!

526
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,653
Don't you take one step.

527
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:26,864
The accident was caused by speeding.

528
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,617
He rushed because of me.

529
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,287
If it hadn't been for my birthday,

530
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,082
they'd still be alive.

531
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:41,212
Humans tend to blame themselves

532
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,923
when misfortune strikes their loved ones.

533
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:48,302
I know it's absurd.

534
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,472
Yet,

535
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:56,102
I think to myself time and time again,

536
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,146
"If only I hadn't rushed him."

537
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,234
"If only I had gone with them."

538
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,537
You said I should let you know
if I needed anything, right?

539
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,250
There's something I need.

540
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,391
I want you…

541
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,936
to stay next to me.

542
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,064
So never say

543
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:45,651
you're going somewhere
far away alone again.

544
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:53,325
I know I wasn't dreaming
when you said that to me.

545
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,331
I'll grant your wish.

546
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,252
I'll never leave you

547
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,172
no matter what happens.

548
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,054
Promise me.

549
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,488
Do-hee.

550
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,577
That's really hard to believe.

551
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:39,705
On top of all the talk
about powers, deals, and whatnot,

552
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:43,334
a demon protects you like a guardian?

553
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,586
People would think you're crazy.

554
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,421
You saw it yourself, didn't you?

555
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,549
That's why I'm so confused.

556
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:56,722
But why did the culprit
come after you again?

557
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:59,433
You've given everything up,
including the inheritance.

558
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:02,895
Maybe the culprit isn't after money
or the chairperson position

559
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,564
but just wants me dead.

560
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:09,777
By the way,

561
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,445
Noh Suk-min came to see me.

562
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,446
He did?

563
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,364
What for?

564
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,574
He made an investment offer
out of nowhere.

565
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,826
Knowing him,
I'm sure he has an ulterior motive.

566
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:19,828
Should I go talk to him?

567
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,497
What?

568
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:25,209
I'll just casually sound him out.

569
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:28,379
You know I'm good at looking innocent.

570
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,885
I thought it was just a little sprain,
but here we are.

571
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,929
Tennis is dangerous, I tell you.

572
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:39,598
That's why you should work out regularly.

573
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:41,976
You're right.

574
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,396
Anyway, what's Do-gyeong up to?

575
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:46,397
I can't reach him.

576
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,359
He's on a business trip. Why?

577
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:52,403
Just because.
I haven't seen him in a while.

578
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:08,919
I'll be honest.

579
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:12,172
I'm here to join your side.

580
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,593
Is it too late?

581
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,595
I actually went to see Do-hee today.

582
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:18,721
You did?

583
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,681
What did you talk about?

584
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,267
That we should get along
since we're family.

585
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:27,062
It seems like
she's still holding a grudge.

586
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,189
Please put in a good word for me.

587
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,357
I will.

588
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,735
I hope we can all get along.

589
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:17,780
Seok-hoon.

590
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,784
This isn't the bathroom.

591
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,245
The door was open.

592
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,374
Come have some dessert.

593
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:29,667
Okay.

594
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:44,348
Do-hee.

595
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,059
I'm leaving Suk-min's house now.

596
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,186
Something's definitely off.

597
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,563
He said Do-gyeong was on a business trip,

598
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,482
but he seemed to be hiding something.

599
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:56,026
And I saw something suspicious.

600
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,486
Which is?

601
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:03,367
A green book
that says "Demon" on the cover.

602
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:36,066
JIU-JITSU 2 DAN, NOH DO-GYEONG

603
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:39,445
Get me

604
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:41,488
some painkillers.

605
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:46,535
Get me morphine or something!

606
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,334
You must be in a lot of pain.

607
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:57,921
I'm fine.

608
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,382
This isn't my first rodeo.

609
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,635
Is Do Do-hee dead?

610
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:11,852
You…

611
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,397
failed to prove yourself.

612
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,168
Turn yourself in
once the urgent care is done.

613
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,465
-Father.
-That'll reduce your sentence.

614
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:45,511
You understand
the gravity of your crimes, don't you?

615
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:49,056
You killed your grandmother for money

616
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,434
and attempted to kill Do-hee,
who's also like family.

617
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:56,480
But I won't give up on you.

618
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,651
Because you're my son
until the day you die.

619
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,371
This is where the book is supposed to be.

620
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:24,841
This will take forever.

621
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,314
It's Gi Kwang-chul's phone.

622
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:25,861
He saw my face. He'll come for me.

623
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:30,949
Let's find Noh Do-gyeong.

624
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,162
REQUESTED CCTV FOOTAGE NEAR THE SCENE

625
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,414
Who on earth could be behind all this?

626
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:40,125
From murder to arson…

627
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,668
A psycho, for sure.

628
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,424
How can I help you?

629
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:54,264
Mr. Noh Do-gyeong?

630
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:57,976
I'm the one…

631
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:00,395
who killed them.

632
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:02,147
Pardon?

633
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,357
Mr. Cha,

634
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:05,984
Gi Kwang-chul,

635
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:08,862
and my grandmother.

636
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:12,157
I killed all of them.

637
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,875
What is Noh Do-gyeong doing here?

638
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,006
It was me.

639
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,801
I'm the one who killed…

640
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:33,887
all of them.

641
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,400
Do Do-hee.

642
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:49,569
Noh Do-gyeong.

643
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,739
Let me ask you one last time.

644
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:54,616
Was it really you?

645
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:57,911
Did you order Gi Kwang-chul
to kill Madam Ju

646
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:01,081
and me?

647
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,335
Answer me.

648
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:07,212
Grandma…

649
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,091
didn't die at Gi Kwang-chul's hands.

650
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,509
Then who?

651
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:18,473
Are you saying you killed her?

652
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:19,975
It wasn't me.

653
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,686
I just followed orders.

654
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:25,564
Who gave you the orders?

655
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:29,359
The devil.

656
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:36,032
The devil lives within me.

657
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,954
I was just following the devil's orders.

658
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,460
Give it to me straight.

659
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:50,505
Did you kill Madam Ju or not?

660
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,384
Answer me!

661
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,678
Tell the truth!

662
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,972
Answer me!

663
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:04,269
There's no point, Do-hee.

664
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,276
Make a deal with me.

665
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,360
I have a wish.

666
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:16,865
I want to torch the world
so that everyone will burn to death.

667
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,619
Perhaps burning in hellfire

668
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:22,746
will finally make them repent their sins!

669
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,874
It's hot!

670
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:29,336
Help!

671
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:38,261
Help!

672
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:41,598
Please!

673
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:42,974
Stop!

674
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:46,770
Please make sure this doesn't get out.

675
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,147
I feel devastated as his parent,

676
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:50,982
but this is the right thing to do.

677
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,611
I'll never forget your kindness,
Commissioner General.

678
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,197
Yes.

679
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,702
Tell people
that he's on a long business trip.

680
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:03,829
When will you

681
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,915
get him out?

682
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,751
He's unwell.

683
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:13,004
He won't last long in there.

684
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:18,009
Since when do you care so much about him?

685
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:21,054
He killed people.

686
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:23,974
His own family at that.

687
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:28,645
Should I hold you responsible
for giving birth to and raising a monster?

688
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:31,606
I'm sorry, honey.

689
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,987
It's all my fault.

690
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:45,620
It all came to nothing.

691
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:47,622
It makes me even more upset.

692
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:52,210
He killed Madam Ju
because of his mental illness?

693
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:55,380
So what if he's crazy?

694
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,967
He's running away from his crimes.

695
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,886
If his condition is as claimed,

696
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:03,305
he'll be put into custody
for treatment soon.

697
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:06,516
Did he look like he was faking it
for a reduced sentence?

698
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,684
It wasn't fake.

699
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,228
It was real.

700
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:13,315
Let's wait for the results
of his psychiatric evaluation first.

701
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:26,244
Mr. Jeong.

702
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,457
Let's go grab a drink.

703
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,002
MIRAE F&B

704
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,776
Your bones won't heal if you drink.

705
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:01,571
Humans frustrate me.

706
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:03,865
Mr. Jeong.

707
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:06,576
Do you love Do-hee?

708
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:11,331
Can you believe what the devil says?

709
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,249
I'm doing my best to believe you.

710
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:16,211
I've always disliked humans.

711
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:18,546
No, it'd be more correct to say
I've loathed them.

712
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,048
Do-hee is human too.

713
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:21,424
She is.

714
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:22,384
That's why

715
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:24,719
I'm starting

716
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:27,514
to adore humans.

717
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:29,557
Except for you.

718
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:37,565
What brings you here?

719
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,360
I'm not here to apologize.

720
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,654
I didn't think you were.

721
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:44,531
But I guess you are.

722
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,869
Now that you're here, let's celebrate.

723
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,747
No one died,

724
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:54,666
and Gu-won got his powers back.

725
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:56,251
Just say it.

726
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,211
Chew me out all you want.

727
00:54:58,294 --> 00:55:00,714
I've been going after someone
a lot worse than you,

728
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,799
so I have no anger left for you.

729
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:09,806
I heard

730
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,142
the culprit got caught.

731
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:17,063
I didn't expect to feel this way.

732
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,400
I wonder if this is

733
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:23,403
how revenge is supposed to end.

734
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:32,287
Pull yourself together

735
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:35,123
and go back to your normal life.

736
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:40,420
So that Director Jeong can relax.

737
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:44,549
You never change, Ms. Jin.

738
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:54,434
The man Do-hee married

739
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,896
isn't just some regular bad guy

740
00:55:59,105 --> 00:55:59,981
but the devil.

741
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,777
What's more ridiculous

742
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,612
is that I somehow feel reassured

743
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:08,948
by the fact that you're by her side.

744
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:09,991
Is that so?

745
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,826
Do you feel reassured?

746
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:15,080
Then please stop showing up.

747
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:16,998
I don't want to see you anymore.

748
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:18,208
I can't do that.

749
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:23,588
I'll keep showing up all the time
and make sure you're being good to her.

750
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:27,634
Don't forget I'm keeping an eye on you.

751
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:31,471
It's exactly the same as the last time.

752
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:33,056
You sound so threatening.

753
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:35,183
You scare me so much
that I can't even sleep--

754
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:36,142
Also,

755
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,394
show some respect.

756
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:41,189
I'm your senior

757
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:43,650
in the family tree.

758
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:50,532
You're not even her real cousin.

759
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:53,743
Cheers.

760
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:05,547
Before I met Director Jeong,

761
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:07,841
my life was a living hell.

762
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:12,178
When that hell crumbled down,

763
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:15,140
his face was the first thing I saw.

764
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:18,726
He's…

765
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:21,896
like a mother bird to me.

766
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:25,984
I know it sounds crazy,

767
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:28,945
but I was envious
that you could make a sacrifice for him.

768
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:33,616
I understand you.

769
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,996
He's like that for me as well.

770
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,414
Don't empathize with me.

771
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:42,834
I don't want you to be such a nice person.

772
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:44,002
It makes me feel…

773
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:51,426
It makes me look bad.

774
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,439
To be clear, that wasn't an apology.

775
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:16,034
For crying out loud!

776
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:24,417
Listen.

777
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:27,712
If you ever hurt Do-hee,

778
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:30,840
I'll become a priest…

779
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:36,304
and exorcise you, Jeong Gu-won.

780
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:42,644
How come everyone in this family

781
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:44,604
becomes a mess when they're drunk?

782
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:51,027
My Do-hee…

783
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:55,114
needs to be happy.

784
00:58:58,576 --> 00:58:59,536
She…

785
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:02,789
has to be happy.

786
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,000
Don't worry.

787
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,044
I'm ready to risk all

788
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:11,005
for her happiness.

789
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,802
Keep your word.

790
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:19,013
If you don't,

791
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:21,224
I'll chase you…

792
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:24,811
to hell.

793
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:51,421
-You scared me.
-Sorry.

794
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:55,091
I was too tired to use the door.

795
00:59:56,050 --> 01:00:00,680
It seems like Ju Seok-hoon
is actually jealous of you, not me.

796
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:01,973
He likes me way too much.

797
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:09,480
Did you drink?

798
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:11,899
No.

799
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:17,488
I smell alcohol.

800
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,745
Drink only when you're happy.

801
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:25,913
If you drink because you're sad…

802
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:29,500
it makes me even sadder.

803
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:31,753
I said I didn't drink.

804
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:32,795
Did you drink?

805
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:36,049
Do you want some tea?

806
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:37,050
Sure.

807
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,178
Do I smell like alcohol?

808
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:05,745
Here's a gift.

809
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:08,081
Open it up.

810
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:52,834
You must have erased

811
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:57,755
the memories of that woman
because they tormented you.

812
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:02,176
Two people entangled in fate

813
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:05,179
are meant to be reunited
in one way or another.

814
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:08,307
Because fate always repeats itself.

815
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:43,611
I killed…

816
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:47,031
you.

817
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:51,095
The company would take a huge blow.

818
01:04:51,178 --> 01:04:52,597
So please keep a lid on this matter.

819
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,683
Did he really not know
what Noh Do-gyeong was up to?

820
01:04:55,766 --> 01:04:56,809
You knew everything, didn't you?

821
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,979
You're the real evil one.

822
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:02,607
When I was human, I killed people.

823
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:03,691
A lot of people.

824
01:05:03,774 --> 01:05:06,736
That must be why your tattoo transferred.
So that the misfortune could strike again.

825
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:08,654
Our encounter wasn't a coincidence.

826
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:10,573
What kind of person were you?

827
01:05:10,656 --> 01:05:13,159
I was in love with someone.
Her name was Wolsim.

828
01:05:18,205 --> 01:05:23,210
