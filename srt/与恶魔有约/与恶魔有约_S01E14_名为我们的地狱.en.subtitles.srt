1
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,297
It seems like your hell has just begun.

2
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,010
Let me know if you find the book.

3
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,636
Who knows?

4
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,096
That might be…

5
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,892
your ticket out of hell.

6
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,435
It's all his doing!

7
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,899
Noh Suk-min killed
both his mother and Do-gyeong!

8
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,486
He was also the one
who tried to kill Do Do-hee.

9
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:13,239
Noh Suk-min, that bastard,

10
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,993
is the devil.

11
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,919
My mother used to believe in nothing,
let alone have any religion.

12
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:28,838
But she started going to confession
day in and day out after their death!

13
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,089
Why do you think?

14
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,425
What was she so desperate to wash away?

15
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,302
Just what was she so afraid of?

16
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,891
All the favors and affection
she showered on you

17
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,394
were actually her ticket to heaven.

18
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,355
That's a lie.

19
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,356
You're lying!

20
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,363
Then ask her yourself.

21
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,073
Whether she's in heaven or hell,

22
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,033
go ask her yourself!

23
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,080
Are you all right, sir?

24
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,500
Sir!

25
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,544
Sir!

26
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:53,798
Sir!

27
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,057
I finally get to witness your powers.

28
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,229
Kill me

29
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,856
so we can go to hell together.

30
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,443
You'll cease to exist if you kill a human.

31
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,364
Knowledge without power

32
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,867
can be dangerous.

33
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,535
Gu-won!

34
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,295
I may not be allowed to kill you,

35
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,172
but tormenting you is no problem.

36
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,717
You'll end up begging me to kill you.

37
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,846
That's enough, Gu-won.

38
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,389
Let's hand him over to the police.

39
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,974
There's no point.

40
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,894
There won't be any evidence whatsoever.

41
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,272
You won't be able to touch
a hair on my head.

42
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,817
There is one piece of evidence
you failed to get rid of.

43
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,238
Kim…

44
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,448
Se-ra.

45
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,457
For a long time,

46
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,961
my husband had been anxious
that his mother wouldn't let him

47
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,129
take over her position.

48
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,800
So he made preparations.

49
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:23,179
How did you gather all this information
without him knowing?

50
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:24,722
He thinks…

51
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:29,227
I'm oblivious.

52
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,775
Family is always the problem.

53
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,860
You should've been nicer to your family.

54
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:40,905
Make a deal with me.

55
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,533
You can take my soul or anything you want.

56
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,617
But please,

57
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,203
make sure all this is kept secret.

58
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,248
I'll leave Do-hee alone from now on.

59
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,416
I promise.

60
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,297
Like I'd believe that.

61
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,632
You're downright evil.

62
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,175
Wicked scumbags like you

63
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,886
are taking away my job.

64
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,346
Give up, Noh Suk-min.

65
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,558
You have nowhere to flee to.

66
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,355
You're wrong.

67
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,607
I can still flee to hell.

68
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:21,696
No!

69
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:42,884
EPISODE 14
OUR PERSONAL HELL

70
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,720
All this for the chairman position?

71
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,931
Is he the devil or what?

72
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:53,186
I can't believe Noh Suk-min
had everyone fooled all this time.

73
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,521
Have you contacted his family?

74
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,858
Yes, I've contacted
Ms. Noh Su-ahn and Mr. Ju Seok-hoon.

75
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,193
Come to think of it,

76
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,070
they're related to
the victim and the suspect.

77
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,154
Goodness.

78
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,326
Ms. Noh.

79
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,368
Is it true?

80
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,163
Did my brother really kill my mother?

81
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,123
I'm afraid so.

82
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,843
Chairman Noh Suk-min of Mirae Group

83
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,012
committed suicide
by jumping from a building.

84
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,431
-The Mirae Group chairman?
-He had been accused of

85
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,434
murdering the late Chairwoman Ju,
which caused a stir.

86
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,646
He also turned out to be the mastermind
behind the recent embezzlement

87
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,524
and corporate malfeasance
on an astronomical scale.

88
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,693
With his body still missing,

89
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,903
the police…

90
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,159
Is he really dead?

91
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,577
If he were alive,

92
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,079
I would be able to find him.

93
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,039
I tried to find him

94
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,000
by using my powers,

95
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,293
but it didn't work.

96
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,921
I should've arrived sooner.

97
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,382
I'm sorry.

98
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,553
It's okay.

99
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:09,762
This is nothing.

100
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,576
Mr. Jeong.

101
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,035
Sorry for coming by unannounced.

102
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,871
Are you coming from the police station?

103
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,789
How's Do-hee holding up?

104
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,917
Have they found the body?

105
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:41,919
Not yet.

106
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,880
The search is proving to be difficult.

107
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,508
Apparently, it can take up to a month
for a body to float up during winter.

108
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,843
How's his wife?

109
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,928
The police will likely
look into the case immediately,

110
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,388
as her testimony was so detailed.

111
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,892
By the way, how did you persuade her?

112
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,312
I simply made her face reality.

113
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,149
Humans really are the scariest.

114
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,692
He killed his own mother

115
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,777
and framed his son for it.

116
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,780
He used his entire family

117
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,073
as a means to his end.

118
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,660
Humans do more inhumane things
than any other creature.

119
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:18,956
Noh Suk-min…

120
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,419
told me something strange.

121
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,464
What was it?

122
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,008
That Madam Ju

123
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,593
killed my parents.

124
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,181
What? That's absurd.

125
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,265
Don't tell me you buy that.

126
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,351
I know it's absurd.

127
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,561
But it bothers me.

128
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,022
There's no reason
for her to have done that.

129
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,900
He said my dad visited her

130
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,693
on the day my parents passed.

131
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:52,031
Since a big investment was in sight,
he blackmailed her.

132
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,867
Don't let it get to you, Do-hee.

133
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:58,371
I'm sure he made that up
to hurt you even in his last moments.

134
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,794
What do you think

135
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,504
about what Noh Suk-min said?

136
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,590
It can't be true.

137
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,008
It better not be.

138
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:15,513
Aunt Cheon-suk is the one
who got Do-hee out of hell.

139
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:18,349
If it turns out she was actually the one
who put Do-hee through hell,

140
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,726
Do-hee will be completely devastated.

141
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,187
It would mean the world
she thought she knew

142
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,564
was nothing but a lie.

143
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,181
Gu-won.

144
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,142
Yes?

145
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,227
I just

146
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,563
wanted to know if you were there.

147
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,360
I'm right here, holding you.

148
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,113
Keep calling my name.

149
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:17,199
I'll answer every time.

150
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,037
Gu-won.

151
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,873
Yes, Do-hee.

152
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,376
Gu-won.

153
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,754
Yes, Do-hee.

154
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,017
Gu-won.

155
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,603
Yes, I'm here.

156
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:00,701
CHAIRMAN NOH SUK-MIN OF MIRAE GROUP
JUMPS TO HIS DEATH

157
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,621
CEO Do Do-hee
is said to have been at the scene

158
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:07,083
when Chairman Noh Suk-min
jumped from the building…

159
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,876
Please refer to our official statement.

160
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,045
-The article was inappropriate.
-It's a personal tragedy,

161
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,381
-but time will hopefully heal all wounds.
-We're not planning

162
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,007
any interviews.

163
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,759
Our official statement…

164
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,135
-Hello? Are you there?
-Hello?

165
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,637
Are you listening? Hello?

166
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,352
Stop wasting your energy
on unreasonable requests

167
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,812
and get back to work.

168
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,405
Should we

169
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,448
perform an exorcism or something?

170
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,449
An exorcism?

171
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,203
People keep dying.

172
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,746
There must be a reason.

173
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,917
I bet our company
is under a curse or something.

174
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,585
An exorcism would cost a fortune.

175
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:56,841
Also, I'm not sure
if it'll have any effect.

176
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,593
Should I talk to Ms. Do?

177
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,429
-About the exorcism?
-Yes.

178
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,893
I said get back to work.

179
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,103
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

180
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,067
Ma'am,

181
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,737
there are reporters everywhere.

182
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,739
Maybe we should form a human shield

183
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,700
and help Ms. Do get through or something.

184
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,034
Good morn…

185
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,661
Nope, just a morning.

186
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,707
How did she get through the crowd?

187
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,418
Do you want me to give you more work?

188
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,878
There's no need.

189
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,671
I'm busy working on the event.

190
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,715
We're so busy, right?

191
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,592
Let's hurry up.

192
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,677
Come in.

193
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,137
You got here safely.

194
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,973
It's thanks to Gu-won's powers.

195
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,766
It's chaos out there.

196
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,852
But let's be patient.

197
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,396
Things will blow over soon.

198
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,524
Do I need to sign something?

199
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:05,784
This isn't for me.

200
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,244
It is for you.

201
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,663
Look, are you trying
to drive me out with this?

202
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,040
It's not like that.

203
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,875
It's just that we've had
a streak of bad luck.

204
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,711
Don't worry. Everything's over now.

205
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,298
You're more gullible than you look.

206
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,217
It was expensive!

207
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,386
Here.

208
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,388
I appreciate the gesture, Ms. Shin.

209
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,473
Understood.

210
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,935
You're surprisingly similar to Mr. Park.

211
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:46,367
I guess she has an even stronger talisman
right next to her.

212
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,002
Come in.

213
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,341
Ms. Jin Ga-young is here to see you.

214
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,183
Dig in.

215
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,727
This is the best meal
you can get around here.

216
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,820
Tomorrow's my last performance.

217
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,699
Is this an apology?

218
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,617
I don't believe in apologies.

219
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,328
As if a few words could undo everything.

220
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,124
People apologize
to feel better about themselves.

221
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,671
It was wrong of me

222
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,923
to deceive you

223
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,259
and for wanting Ms. Do dead.

224
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,094
Just look the other way.

225
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:50,097
Do Do-hee has to die for you to live!

226
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,642
If you ended up
in the same situation again,

227
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,645
would you make a different choice?

228
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,188
No.

229
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,482
This is who I am

230
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,819
and my way of loving Director Jeong.

231
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,571
I'll try to understand.

232
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,948
You once told me

233
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:09,783
we had something in common.

234
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,288
I, for one, will try to understand you.

235
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,500
Now, dig in.

236
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,052
-Sweep more over there.
-Yes, sir.

237
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,261
SUNNY SPOT RICE SOUP

238
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,554
-Boss.
-Look alive.

239
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,140
We've left the underworld

240
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,518
and taken on a lawful occupation
under the sun.

241
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,603
I…

242
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,441
Blabbermouth!

243
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,651
Yes, sir!

244
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:45,861
What is it, sir?

245
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,738
Look at the sign.

246
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,824
Aren't those chives and not scallions?

247
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,913
I'm sorry, sir.

248
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,289
I'll take care of it!

249
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,044
Please take care of it, chef.

250
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,545
Yes, sir.

251
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,714
Excuse me!

252
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:06,924
Those aren't scallions!

253
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,133
For crying out loud.

254
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,385
Real men

255
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,761
need big scallions!

256
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,221
I asked for scallions!

257
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,890
-We got it.
-What did I do wrong?

258
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,267
We serve you with love.

259
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,229
Welcome to Sunny Spot Rice Soup.

260
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,450
I think this belongs to you.

261
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:37,579
Goodbye then.

262
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,917
Noh Suk-min said

263
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:43,961
that Ju Cheon-suk

264
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,921
killed Do-hee's parents.

265
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:49,925
Is this news to you?

266
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,260
It is.

267
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,806
But if he said that,

268
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,349
I'm sure he meant it.

269
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,103
He believed that his mother

270
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,397
was capable of even worse things.

271
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:19,955
Director Jeong!

272
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,876
Is it true that Noh Do-gyeong
wasn't the culprit?

273
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,670
Just how many culprits are there?

274
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:30,382
We seem to end up
with a new culprit at every turn.

275
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,800
Is it certain this time?

276
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,635
-Mr. Park.
-Yes?

277
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:35,971
Let's say…

278
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:41,393
that you believed
someone pulled you out of hell.

279
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:45,439
But it turns out…

280
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,359
that person was actually the one
who threw you into hell.

281
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,489
What would you do?

282
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,532
I'd cut ties with the person.

283
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,495
When someone hurts you,
cutting ties is the best remedy.

284
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,413
What if the person is dead?

285
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,956
Then all ties are cut. Problem solved.

286
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,541
Who are you talking about anyway?

287
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,503
Ju Cheon-suk.

288
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,838
She may have…

289
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,842
killed Do-hee's parents.

290
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,761
Hold on.

291
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,971
What do you mean she may have killed them?

292
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,807
Did she kill them or not?

293
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,683
It was what Noh Suk-min said,
so it isn't clear yet.

294
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:22,601
What the…

295
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,728
He dumped that on you before he died?

296
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,106
He must be the real culprit.

297
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,066
He was evil to the very end.

298
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,987
So that's why you look so down.

299
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,323
I guess it's complicated.

300
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,784
The truth would be
too frightening to dig up

301
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,245
but would weigh on your mind
if you didn't.

302
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,122
But if I were her…

303
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,083
What?

304
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,503
I would deny it and move on.

305
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:54,967
Is it even possible…

306
00:18:58,595 --> 00:18:59,680
to move on from that?

307
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,725
It'd hurt every now and then
like a thorn in your side.

308
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:05,602
Still,

309
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,230
I'd choose imperfect happiness

310
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,815
over the painful truth.

311
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,667
The articles about our new product's
sales figures should be out by now.

312
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:36,884
CHAIRMAN NOH SUK-MIN'S BODY STILL MISSING

313
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,845
My mother used to believe in nothing,
let alone have any religion.

314
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:42,973
But she started going to confession
day in and day out after their death!

315
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,266
Why do you think?

316
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,602
What was she so desperate to wash away?

317
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,812
Just what was she so afraid of?

318
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,531
MIRAE ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT

319
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:14,129
MIRAE ELECTRONICS' FIRST OFFICIAL
ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT

320
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,808
CEO JU CHEON-SUK ON HER KNEES

321
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,728
I'll expose everything.

322
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,482
How dare you blackmail me?

323
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,608
What do you want?

324
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,526
Wait and see.

325
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,656
It won't go as you want.

326
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:44,201
All the favors and affection
she showered on you

327
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,704
were actually her ticket to heaven.

328
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,706
Ta-da!

329
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,626
It's been over 20 years
since your parents passed.

330
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:55,087
You can stop commemorating
their death anniversary.

331
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,588
Just celebrate your birthday.

332
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:24,199
How long have you worked for Madam Ju?

333
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,202
I worked for her for about 20 years
before working for you.

334
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,580
Were you there

335
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:34,543
when she acknowledged
Mirae Electronics' industrial accident

336
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,962
for the first time?

337
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,088
Yes.

338
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:41,675
I had just started working
as her secretary then.

339
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,392
When did she start using a cane?

340
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,521
She was already using it
when I first met her.

341
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:58,567
It was around when you first met her.

342
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,361
At your parents' funeral.

343
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,285
Did something

344
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,912
happen back then?

345
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,208
She never explained why.

346
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:18,211
We were just told
that it was a chronic illness.

347
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,161
Gu-won.

348
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,873
What should I do?

349
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:14,267
Madam Ju disapproved of my commemorating

350
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,604
the death anniversary of my parents
on my birthday.

351
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,024
She kept urging me

352
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,609
to forget the unfortunate past.

353
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,164
If what Noh Suk-min said is true,

354
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:43,004
and Madam Ju really did deceive me,

355
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,676
then what should I do?

356
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,264
I feel

357
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,641
like I'm caught in a trap.

358
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,233
Do you remember

359
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,820
the text Ju Cheon-suk sent you
before she died?

360
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,325
She said that she loved you.

361
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,368
I LOVE YOU, DO-HEE

362
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:19,374
Even while dying in pain,

363
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:25,005
she texted you to express her love.

364
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:31,636
Humans become

365
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:37,100
the most honest with themselves
when faced with death.

366
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:44,107
That's what I've witnessed

367
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,442
for the last 200 years.

368
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,074
You're right.

369
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,082
Too bad the dead tell no tales.

370
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,710
One word with her

371
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,879
and everything would be solved.

372
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:07,881
Right?

373
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:22,479
There is a way…

374
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:27,442
to hear from Madam Ju.

375
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,375
How can you hear from Ju Cheon-suk here?

376
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,293
She was close with the priest here

377
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,712
named Father Michael.

378
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,214
He might

379
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,050
be able to tell us something.

380
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,511
How would he know anything?

381
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,391
Father.

382
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,480
I see.

383
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:06,439
Through confession.

384
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,526
It's been a while, Do-hee.

385
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,823
This is my husband.

386
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,332
I'm Father Michael.

387
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,209
Jeong Gu-won.

388
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,213
He speaks rather peculiarly.

389
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,173
You must not be from around here.

390
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,636
By the way,

391
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,014
how was Ms. Ju's funeral?

392
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,766
I was volunteering in Mongolia
and couldn't make it.

393
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,686
It was an eventful day.

394
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,147
I read about it in the newspaper.

395
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,649
I heard that Suk-min is dead.

396
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,612
That's the reason I'm here.

397
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:57,407
He told me something strange
before he died.

398
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:04,873
Could you

399
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,917
give us some privacy?

400
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,713
Can you wait outside?

401
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,177
Call me if something happens.

402
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,094
Okay.

403
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,289
I have a bad feeling about him.

404
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,256
I guess it's finally time.

405
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:02,931
Ms. Ju…

406
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,394
felt guilty until the very end…

407
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,319
for not being completely honest with you.

408
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,622
Father.

409
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,208
I can't go to heaven, can I?

410
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,171
But there is something I fear more…

411
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,466
than going to hell.

412
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,177
I'm afraid of…

413
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,765
not receiving her forgiveness.

414
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:50,687
Your own mind is keeping you in hell.

415
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,273
It's time you confessed the truth

416
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,859
and freed yourself.

417
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,778
The truth…

418
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,037
If I can't find the courage

419
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:11,124
before I die…

420
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,419
and…

421
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,924
if Do-hee asks for the truth,

422
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:22,761
then I ask…

423
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:28,057
for you to tell her.

424
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,694
Was this your order?

425
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,740
Did you order
the work environment measurement data

426
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:44,949
to be tampered with?

427
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,075
It's only for a while.

428
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:50,079
I'll replace the dust collectors
once the investment is finalized.

429
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:51,915
"Only for a while"?

430
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,126
People might die in the meantime.

431
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:59,422
Are you saying you're going to exchange
people's lives with the investment?

432
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,299
There's an order to everything.

433
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,761
Certain risks must be accepted

434
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,430
in pursuit of greater goals.

435
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,849
But you're not the one at risk!

436
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:13,311
By doing this, you're sacrificing
your employees who trust you

437
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:17,982
for your own personal gain!

438
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,945
The company is at a crossroads.

439
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:25,740
An investment offer this big
doesn't come by so often!

440
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,576
There's nothing to be done.

441
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,744
Every goal

442
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,038
requires some collateral damage.

443
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,957
You leave me no choice.

444
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:37,001
I'll expose everything.

445
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,263
How dare you blackmail me?

446
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,306
What do you want?

447
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,058
Is it money?

448
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:55,645
I just want you to take responsibility

449
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:58,523
and make sure this doesn't happen again.

450
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:01,985
You're the one
who quit the company and took off.

451
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:03,903
What gives you the right?

452
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:09,951
This is my company.

453
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,537
You didn't build it alone.

454
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,914
It was built
on the blood, sweat, and tears

455
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,041
of everyone who works here!

456
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,335
Honey, you should stop.

457
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,879
We're running out of time.

458
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,422
Wait and see.

459
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:26,175
It won't go as you want.

460
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,793
My wife will send over detailed documents
to your office.

461
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,129
Hundreds of people's lives
are on the line.

462
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,131
This has to be made public.

463
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,930
After what I've been through
to build this company,

464
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,141
how dare you try to destroy it?

465
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:23,900
Honey.

466
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,693
I need to take care of this

467
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,070
before I die.

468
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,076
I'll stop you if it's the last thing I do.

469
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,411
With my own two hands.

470
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,638
It's time, honey.

471
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,185
Don't worry.

472
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,814
I'll have time to see Do-hee before I go.

473
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,658
No!

474
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,906
MY DARLING DAUGHTER DO-HEE

475
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:02,498
Wake up.

476
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,043
Honey.

477
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:07,754
Honey.

478
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,722
Please save my wife.

479
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:08,397
You can't make a wish.

480
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:11,067
You already made a deal with me
ten years ago.

481
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:14,862
Please, I can't leave Do-hee on her own.

482
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:20,159
You'll die of a heart attack.

483
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,459
Do-hee.

484
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,003
Do-hee.

485
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:23,514
What on earth…

486
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,519
have you done?

487
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,857
From the look in your eyes,

488
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,860
I can tell you're desperate for something.

489
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,530
What?

490
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,367
Do you want me to grant your wish?

491
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,496
I can make your deepest wish come true

492
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,665
and give you the life you want.

493
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,375
Just pay me back after ten years.

494
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,170
After ten years,

495
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,340
your soul will end up in hell.

496
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,434
You must be…

497
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,358
the devil.

498
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,855
Ms. Ju

499
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:58,567
regretted that night all her life.

500
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,363
She kept blaming herself
for what had happened,

501
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:05,700
thinking things would've gone differently
had she not followed them.

502
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,353
What did he say?

503
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,440
Noh Suk-min lied.

504
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,445
Then why do you look so down?

505
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,824
I feel bad for doubting Madam Ju
even for a moment.

506
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,036
Let's go.

507
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:24,612
I'll wash up and go to bed.

508
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:26,572
Do-hee.

509
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:31,786
Don't worry.

510
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,621
I'm just tired.

511
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:16,914
The event that night

512
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:21,919
changed Ms. Ju's attitude
toward life forever.

513
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,965
Her encounter with the actual devil…

514
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,719
finally stopped her
from being a devil herself.

515
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,531
Are you heading out?

516
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,784
Yes, to sign a new deal.

517
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,248
I tend to be more productive at night.

518
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,798
Go to bed.

519
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,508
Don't wait up.

520
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,281
You're back.

521
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,825
You must have realized who I was…

522
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,371
seeing as this doesn't surprise you.

523
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,873
Why would I be surprised?

524
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,208
Your existence

525
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:52,046
proves the existence of God.

526
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,922
So you think God has your back.

527
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,636
Actually, I've been expecting you.

528
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:02,931
Leave Do-hee.

529
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,312
You're a danger to her.

530
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,024
You can't stay with her.

531
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:13,817
Maybe it's your profession,

532
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,778
but you seem very prejudiced against me.

533
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:17,821
I'm harmless.

534
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,367
At least to Do-hee.

535
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,577
Aren't you curious

536
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,913
how I know about you?

537
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,625
An extraordinary aura
and a peculiar way of speaking.

538
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:30,793
The moment I saw you,

539
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:34,630
I knew you were the devil

540
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,590
Ms. Ju spoke of.

541
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:42,638
Are you saying Ju Cheon-suk had met me?

542
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,974
She was there to witness

543
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,477
you leading

544
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,105
Do-hee's father to hell.

545
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:56,193
You can't make a wish.

546
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:58,862
You already made a deal with me
ten years ago.

547
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,782
Please, I can't leave Do-hee on her own.

548
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:08,664
You must be…

549
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:11,917
the devil.

550
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:41,298
Not recognizing someone
after such a long time

551
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,926
isn't all that uncommon.

552
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,303
As you know,

553
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:51,350
humans wear out quickly and easily.

554
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:54,394
But to think

555
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:57,689
the repetition of the unfortunate fate

556
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:00,526
that you were so anxious to avoid

557
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:03,946
had already taken place.

558
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,491
So you knew everything.

559
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,451
As I said,

560
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:12,412
you had to figure it out yourself.

561
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:17,793
Humans think I control everything.

562
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:19,461
But…

563
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:22,714
I'm a mere companion
on the journey of everything.

564
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:35,954
Madam Ju.

565
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,207
I promised to come back in a better mood,

566
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,503
but I couldn't keep my promise.

567
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:48,258
If you'd been honest with me,

568
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,222
would I still have fallen in love
with Gu-won?

569
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,371
What could've been my dad's wish?

570
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:30,801
I must find out…

571
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,263
what kind of deal my dad made.

572
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,517
Who knows

573
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,229
if Gu-won saved my dad's life?

574
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:58,203
CONTRACT EXPIRATION

575
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:15,929
Ms. Do.

576
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:20,767
Today's my last performance.

577
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,645
We couldn't get along,

578
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,857
but I wanted to say goodbye.

579
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:30,610
Are you never coming back to Korea?

580
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:32,237
No.

581
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:34,531
You should be careful.

582
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:37,868
This is what happens
when a human falls in love with a demon.

583
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,667
I was joking.

584
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,379
I hope you'll be happy

585
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:52,257
whether you're with Director Jeong or not.

586
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,343
Thank you.

587
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:57,179
I'll be happy.

588
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:02,517
-Please participate in the event.
-Thank you.

589
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:03,935
Please give us a good review.

590
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,604
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

591
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:08,190
The colors are so pretty.

592
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:10,942
-Can I try it?
-Please go ahead.

593
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:13,153
It's super popular
on social media these days.

594
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,030
Will I become popular if I drink this?

595
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,449
Please give us a good review.

596
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:19,159
-Have a nice day.
-Try our drinks.

597
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,076
Thank you.

598
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:23,205
I'll carry it.

599
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:24,331
No, thank you.

600
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,291
Then should we carry it together?

601
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:37,344
I'm so happy to see you two

602
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:38,887
-getting along so--
-I got it.

603
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,434
So she's got it.

604
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,646
Please give us a good review.

605
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:50,065
Thank you.

606
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:52,651
Mr. Park.

607
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:54,236
Hello.

608
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:56,655
Where's Director Jeong?

609
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:58,114
He went to sign a deal.

610
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,325
He's been working so hard
since he got his powers back.

611
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:05,121
Can we talk in private?

612
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:06,873
In private?

613
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,376
Mr. Park, the director's looking for you.

614
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,128
Go ahead. I can wait.

615
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:13,672
I won't be long.

616
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:16,007
Will you wait in Director Jeong's office?

617
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,092
-Sure.
-All right.

618
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:22,597
-Hurry.
-Okay.

619
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:30,188
An urgent call of nature?

620
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,525
-Things are more urgent for us, Mr. Park.
-Okay.

621
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:37,672
Let's redo it!

622
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,802
I want to sign a new deal!

623
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:46,264
Where is he?

624
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:49,809
He's supposed to be here.

625
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:57,734
It's you, isn't it?

626
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,612
We signed a deal ten years ago.

627
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:02,906
We finally meet again.

628
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:05,909
I've been looking everywhere for you!

629
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:08,912
The deal's off.

630
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:11,790
You can take back
my money, my success, everything.

631
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,795
You came all the way here to say that?

632
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:19,547
Back then, all I cared about was success.

633
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:22,968
I had my priorities all wrong
and made a stupid choice.

634
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:27,555
I've regretted my choice
every single day since.

635
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:30,308
I beg you.

636
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:33,979
I'll cough up everything I wished for,

637
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,981
so please spare my life.

638
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:46,449
What do you humans think a demon is?

639
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,952
Do I look like some angel?

640
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:04,801
Please…

641
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:26,322
Watch carefully.

642
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:29,242
This is what a demon is.

643
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:46,444
KIM JI-YEON

644
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,279
"Kim Ji-yeon."

645
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:13,847
HONG SEOK-YEONG

646
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:14,764
PARK MIN-CHEOL

647
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,474
So all of these

648
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:18,810
are the names of those
who made deals with him?

649
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:24,482
SHIN JU-YEON

650
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:25,608
OH GYU-TAE

651
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:26,943
PARK GYEONG-MIN

652
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,790
My dad's name was also…

653
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:48,214
DO WON-JUN

654
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,239
When did you get here?

655
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:17,076
A human whose contract
was about to expire…

656
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:21,831
just barged into my office.

657
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,291
Your office?

658
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:27,587
Do Do-hee just went there.

659
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:36,304
SUNWOL FOUNDATION

660
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:44,687
Do-hee.

661
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:48,358
Is something wrong?

662
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:54,531
Do-hee.

663
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:28,147
Do-hee.

664
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,149
I don't know what happened,

665
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:33,027
but drink some water and calm down.

666
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:36,030
What's wrong? What happened?

667
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:39,784
Did something happen
between you and Mr. Jeong?

668
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,372
The people I love…

669
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:48,126
have become my hell.

670
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:55,800
I loved them with all my heart,

671
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,557
but now I resent them to death.

672
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:23,786
You were right.

673
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,080
I'll end up…

674
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:31,961
making Do-hee miserable anyway.

675
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:35,673
That's just who I am.

676
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:39,552
That's not just because you're a demon.

677
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:41,971
Humans

678
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,432
are always each other's personal hell.

679
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:00,698
Do-hee.

680
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:10,416
I must find out

681
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:13,670
what kind of deal my dad made.

682
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:17,674
The event that night…

683
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:20,176
Her encounter with the actual devil

684
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:23,513
finally stopped her
from being a devil herself.

685
01:01:25,264 --> 01:01:27,392
Ms. Ju felt guilty until the very end

686
01:01:28,309 --> 01:01:30,937
for not being completely honest with you.

687
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:48,454
She was there to witness

688
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:50,164
you leading

689
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,458
Do-hee's father to hell.

690
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:56,421
If you'd been honest with me,

691
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:59,590
would I still have fallen in love
with Gu-won?

692
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:17,233
MIRAE F&B

693
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:58,900
Let's go for a walk.

694
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,142
Are you cold?

695
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:35,478
No.

696
01:03:44,278 --> 01:03:45,321
Do-hee.

697
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:48,407
-We--
-Let's finish decorating

698
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:50,117
the Christmas tree tonight.

699
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:54,747
I should also book the couple set
that we couldn't have last time.

700
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:58,125
I hope it's still available.

701
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,133
I don't think…

702
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:15,309
we can spend Christmas together.

703
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:23,693
Do-hee.

704
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:28,030
Save yourself…

705
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:33,244
from hell.

706
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:13,034
Gu-won.

707
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:21,876
Gu-won.

708
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:33,512
Gu-won.

709
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,102
Gu-won disappeared,

710
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:25,314
and my salvation came to an end.

711
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:23,247
The more you loved me,
the more you suffered.

712
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:24,415
Still you continued to love me.

713
01:07:24,498 --> 01:07:25,750
We would've ended up like this anyway.

714
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:26,834
I'm going away for a bit.

715
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:29,420
Until Do-hee
gets her happy ending without me.

716
01:07:29,503 --> 01:07:30,588
Everything's back to normal, that's all.

717
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:33,632
Do you think this can hurt me?

718
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:35,926
No way. I'm fine.

719
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,470
It's been a week,

720
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:40,014
and Chairman Noh Suk-min's body
is still missing.

721
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:41,015
Could it be…

722
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:45,811
They have yet to find any clues
regarding the chairman.

723
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:55,237
