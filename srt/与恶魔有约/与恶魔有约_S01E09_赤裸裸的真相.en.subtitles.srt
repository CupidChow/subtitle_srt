1
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,462
Do what's best for you.

2
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:50,049
Because that's what's best for me.

3
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,468
They're all dead.

4
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,094
Madam Ju,

5
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,512
Mom, and Dad.

6
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,348
Everyone I've ever loved is dead.

7
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,268
And you'll die…

8
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,230
because of me too.

9
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:06,900
I don't care.

10
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,907
Your wound.

11
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,450
It shouldn't get wet.

12
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,095
You…

13
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,347
Your powers…

14
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,559
My powers…

15
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,395
are back.

16
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:09,058
EPISODE 9
THE UNMASKED TRUTH

17
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,315
Is this why…

18
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,153
humans willingly become foolish?

19
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,085
What's wrong?

20
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,295
When did you wake up?

21
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,547
A while ago.

22
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,716
Was I snoring?

23
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,926
-I wouldn't mind worse things than that.
-So I was?

24
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,179
-No, you weren't.
-Are you sure?

25
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,848
Yes. So let me see your face.

26
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:49,766
No.

27
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:51,267
Why not?

28
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:55,104
I don't know. I'm feeling a bit shy.

29
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,648
Let's go out. I'm hungry.

30
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,319
I thought a cup of pour-over coffee
was all you needed.

31
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,780
I know. Maybe it's because
I'm almost human now.

32
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,327
You didn't book the whole place today.

33
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,661
I realized

34
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,831
it might not be a bad idea
to eat among humans.

35
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,541
With so many of them around,

36
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,001
it's nice and lively.

37
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,381
One couple set, please.

38
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:26,052
I'm afraid that's only available
during Christmas, sir.

39
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,014
But that's the whole reason we're here.

40
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,558
Can't we just consider today as Christmas?

41
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,186
To commemorate my mingling with humans.

42
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,522
We don't have the ingredients, sir.

43
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:38,856
Is that right?

44
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,861
Then let's find another place
that serves couple sets.

45
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,488
We'll just have two of these, please.

46
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:46,906
Yes, ma'am.

47
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,078
Isn't this discrimination against demons?

48
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,913
Why are couple sets only available
on Jesus's birthday?

49
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,958
Let's come back on Christmas
and celebrate with your favorite cake.

50
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:00,294
Are you telling a demon
to celebrate Jesus's birthday?

51
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,712
So you don't want to?

52
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:02,797
No, I don't mean that.

53
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:07,343
It's not that I don't want to.
I was just saying.

54
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:12,431
But why does everyone
make such a fuss over Christmas?

55
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,351
Christmas somehow makes you excited.

56
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,395
As if you were a kid again.

57
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,313
Now I see

58
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:22,775
why everyone gets so noisy and rowdy
during Christmas.

59
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,028
I'll do my best as my name suggests.

60
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:29,365
I don't mean to brag,

61
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,452
but I once got set up with a chaebol.

62
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:37,748
The famous heiress
fell in love with me at first sight

63
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,543
and kept pestering me
to register our marriage.

64
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,422
But I told her,
"I refuse to become a chaebol's dog."

65
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,300
"I shall become
a hunting dog for the public."

66
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:51,262
I coldly and resolutely turned her down.

67
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,599
A hunting dog?

68
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,143
Is that why you try to smell everything?

69
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,773
How about another round someplace else?

70
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,195
Love at first sight, my foot.

71
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,197
-Give me your wrist.
-What for?

72
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,492
I'll teach him a lesson
so he won't run his mouth about you again.

73
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,494
Since he wishes to be a hunting dog,

74
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,329
I could give him the nose of--

75
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,580
Forget it.

76
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,124
I'm the one who suggested
registering the marriage and bailed.

77
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,293
Why are you taking that sleazebag's side?

78
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,670
This is so annoying.

79
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,049
By the way, did I tell you?

80
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:28,966
Tell me what?

81
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,427
I'm not going to work today.
It's the company's anniversary.

82
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,428
Really?

83
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,270
What on earth is going on?

84
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,774
Why is Director Jeong unhappy about
Do Do-hee's withdrawal?

85
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,776
Shouldn't he be happy now that she's safe?

86
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,528
Goodness.

87
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,197
Is he still asleep?

88
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,742
I love not going to work.

89
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,453
I thought you loved going to work.

90
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,580
I thought so too

91
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,624
until I fell for a demon.

92
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,879
So what do humans usually do on a date?

93
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,882
They usually grab a bite and have coffee.

94
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,384
That's about it.

95
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,302
How insignificant.

96
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:15,972
Even if it's with me?

97
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:22,728
What is it?

98
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,564
I'm outside your door, Director Jeong.

99
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,232
Open up.

100
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,400
I'm not home right now.

101
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,484
Where are you then?

102
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,194
We're at the Han River.

103
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,238
That's right. We're on a date.

104
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,323
-In your condition?
-I'm fully recovered.

105
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,411
CALL ENDED
DIRECTOR JEONG

106
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,248
What did I miss?

107
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,625
I've been wondering.

108
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,003
What are those
insignificant-looking things?

109
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,296
-Those?
-Yes.

110
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,172
They're tandem bikes for couples.

111
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,841
Couples…

112
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,134
For couples?

113
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,510
Let's try one of those!

114
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,095
It'll be extremely insignificant.

115
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,722
I love insignificant things.

116
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:58,681
Let's go.

117
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,349
-What?
-Come on.

118
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,310
Where are we going?

119
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,228
-Let's get on one of those bikes.
-But…

120
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,408
Why are you sitting in front?

121
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,161
Hold on, look at that!

122
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,038
-What?
-Over there!

123
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,250
Let's try that insignificant thing too.

124
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,419
Is everything for couples these days?

125
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,503
Shall we?

126
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,422
-Sure, let's go.
-Let's go.

127
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:32,465
-Here we go.
-Okay.

128
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,467
-Let's go.
-I'm lifting my feet.

129
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,844
Here we go.

130
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,643
-Higher!
-Higher!

131
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,311
-I said higher!
-Up!

132
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,229
What could it be?

133
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,525
-Higher!
-What would be the most effective way

134
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,570
for her to screw us over
while our guard is down?

135
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,781
-Higher!
-Could it be…

136
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,574
-No way.
-Even higher!

137
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,451
Then what about…

138
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,702
No, that's not it either.

139
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,788
My head is splitting, for crying out loud.

140
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:07,333
I remember my IQ being pretty high,
but have I been drinking too much?

141
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,043
All my brain cells seem dead.

142
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,337
Whatever.

143
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,923
I'm more of a doer than a thinker.

144
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,386
-So cute.
-I like this place.

145
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,846
Nothing is more beautiful
than man-made landscapes.

146
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,057
Isn't it usually the opposite?

147
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,812
I prefer human creations to those of God.

148
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,481
That's why I'm more of a collector
than a traveler.

149
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,816
Do you not like God?

150
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,735
Does anyone like their boss?

151
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,615
Even though I've never met God in person,

152
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,075
I can't seem to get attached.

153
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:44,537
Watching the world deteriorate
for 200 years didn't help either.

154
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,040
I wonder what your life has been like

155
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:51,043
for the past 200 years.

156
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,964
An insignificant human being
could never fathom a demon's existence.

157
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,634
I'm not trying to fathom you.

158
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:02,763
I just want to accept you the way you are.

159
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:09,353
Apparently, demons used to be
the guardians of mankind.

160
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:11,689
Is that true?

161
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,232
Daiomai.

162
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,652
It's an ancient Greek word meaning
"to share the same fate."

163
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,279
The word "demon" comes from that word.

164
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,156
"To share the same fate."

165
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,120
So I was right about us
sharing the same fate.

166
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,001
Then how did they end up becoming evil?

167
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,797
Let's say I gave in
to the hardships in life.

168
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,259
Humans turn to the dark side
after just a few years of work.

169
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,011
I had to do this for 200 years.

170
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,097
I guess you're not too bad.

171
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:53,022
Then you're back to being
your original self.

172
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,408
You're my guardian.

173
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:34,939
Let's go.

174
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,357
Okay.

175
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:44,490
Customer number 82, your couple drink set

176
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,825
and complimentary plush toy are ready.

177
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,245
Thank you.

178
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,288
No, thank you.

179
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,389
I'm starting to think

180
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,851
humans are insignificant
yet adorable at the same time.

181
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,272
It's as if I took in a kitty

182
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,650
and ended up caring about
every stray cat on earth.

183
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:23,988
Who would've known
affection could be this contagious?

184
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,908
Are you now comparing me to a cat
instead of a longhorn beetle?

185
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,204
What do you want, babe?

186
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,540
Whatever you're getting, babe.

187
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,754
If you don't like being called kitty,
then what about "babe"?

188
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,381
No.

189
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,049
Or you could call me hubby.

190
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,468
You must be crazy.

191
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,387
What do you mean?

192
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,305
I am your hubby.

193
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,103
-Let's just go with kitty.
-No.

194
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,524
Look, it's beautiful.

195
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,401
It is.

196
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,711
Seriously, nothing ever gets past her.

197
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,297
My goodness.

198
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,429
Nice.

199
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:32,598
This one's nice too.

200
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,600
Every single picture looks flawless.

201
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,727
They're so photogenic.

202
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,857
Goodness, what on earth am I doing?

203
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,984
I'm not their photographer or anything.

204
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,904
Get it together, Noh Su-ahn.

205
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:49,323
You're here to dig out the truth.

206
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,327
She may fool everyone else, but not me.

207
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:58,874
Do Do-hee, it's time for you
to reveal your true, horrific colors.

208
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,676
Why did you refuse
to go on that insignificant ferry?

209
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,428
Later. We have all the time in the world.

210
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,680
Later when?

211
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:13,973
Let's fix a date.

212
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,058
Otherwise, I might have to wait
another year…

213
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,044
Hello?

214
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,755
Hi, sweetie. Mommy's almost home.

215
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,841
Okay. See you soon.

216
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,306
Do Do-hee.

217
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,522
What a jerk.

218
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,775
He ruined such a great song, didn't he?

219
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:10,904
Let's go.

220
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,850
I don't like this music.

221
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,727
Why not? I like it.

222
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,353
I want something to dance to.

223
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,497
Shall we?

224
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,167
No, I have two left feet.

225
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,044
Just follow my lead.

226
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:33,070
You must trust your partner
when you slow dance.

227
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:06,353
This is our song now.

228
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,545
What happened?

229
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:33,547
What the hell?

230
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,632
What is this?

231
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,885
I'm out here breaking my back

232
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,262
while they're enjoying themselves all day.

233
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,557
I quit.

234
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,643
It's not like me to work my butt off.

235
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:52,357
I'm more of a thinker
than a doer after all.

236
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,650
That's right. I should go.

237
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,822
Next week is the earliest we can hold

238
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:02,367
the special stockholders' meeting
to elect the new chairperson.

239
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,535
Make it this week.

240
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,037
That's going to be a challenge.

241
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,788
There are procedures to follow when…

242
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:18,425
I'm paying you all that money
for you to deal with challenges like this.

243
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:21,011
Let's speed things up as much as we can.

244
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,811
Once you become the chairman,

245
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:34,441
I suppose your son
will be leading Mirae Electronics.

246
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,777
There's something I learned

247
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,321
while I was under my mother
for over 20 years.

248
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,865
The importance of deprivation.

249
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,868
Deprivation leads to growth.

250
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,829
That's what I plan to teach my son.

251
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,291
Good shot!

252
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,820
17 YEARS AGO

253
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,822
I'm here, Mother.

254
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,075
I have to wash it away.

255
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,077
Yes, I have to.

256
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:37,713
I have to wash away

257
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,007
all my filthy sins.

258
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,258
If I don't…

259
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,903
Do you know why
my mother turned her back on us?

260
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,198
I guess she didn't like us.

261
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,243
It was self-hatred.

262
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,996
She despised us
because she despised her own blood.

263
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,918
Surely even someone as thoughtless as you

264
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,339
must realize we're at a critical juncture.

265
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,925
We must convince the public

266
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,596
that we have
a solid and stable succession plan.

267
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,306
I understand.

268
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,141
I'm not like my mother.

269
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:32,893
I intend to fix you up and use you.

270
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:37,773
I can never trust anyone
who isn't of my own blood.

271
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,275
MESSAGE

272
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,950
Do you have a second phone?

273
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,035
It's just…

274
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,204
It's for girls.

275
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,832
Don't worry. I'll sort everything out.

276
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,551
ENFORCER

277
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:13,016
Why haven't I heard from you?
Don't tell me you're bailing out.

278
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,916
What a peaceful morning.

279
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,545
It's been a while.

280
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:46,633
I ended up doing
what's best for me, Madam Ju.

281
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,264
I always thought happiness was fake.

282
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,484
You're up early.

283
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,361
I have to go to work.

284
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,530
I've been thinking.

285
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,491
Why don't we say yesterday was the eve

286
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,785
and have today
as the actual company anniversary?

287
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,706
No. Are you trying
to take the whole year off?

288
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,250
An anniversary deserves
at least two days' celebration.

289
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:23,003
You seem to have less affection
for the company than I do.

290
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,172
Affection for the company?

291
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,259
Hello, Ms. Shin.

292
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:33,013
Ms. Do, we received a document
from Mr. Noh Suk-min.

293
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,395
You can't sign it.

294
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,480
Everything's already over.

295
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,525
We need to catch the bastard
who tried to kill you,

296
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,027
find out who was behind him,

297
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,696
and make sure they leave you alone.

298
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:52,240
I don't want to.

299
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,658
Why not?

300
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,368
I'm fully recovered now.

301
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,039
I don't want to restart the whole thing.

302
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,791
I like the peace I have now.

303
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,878
RENUNCIATION OF INHERITANCE

304
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,379
BENEFICIARY:
DO DO-HEE

305
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,381
DECEDENT:
JU CHEON-SUK

306
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,850
What's best for you

307
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,770
has become what's best for me.

308
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:26,691
I decided to let go
so that everyone else would find peace,

309
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,818
but I'm the one who ended up happy.

310
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,281
You said nothing's free in this world.

311
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,951
Happiness requires sacrifice.

312
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:38,828
And I think it's well worth it.

313
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:42,999
Do Do-hee.

314
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:50,215
Are you really going to give up like this
without even knowing his face?

315
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,843
If you give up now,

316
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,929
you'll live the rest of your life in fear.

317
00:25:56,846 --> 00:26:00,308
You can't maintain peace
by covering things up.

318
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,981
Let's just go see his face.

319
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,774
After that,

320
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,944
I'll do as you say.

321
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,785
All right.

322
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:21,871
I'll see his face and that'll be it, okay?

323
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,308
I've been by your side all day.

324
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,018
Why am I not recharged?

325
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,813
Let's try again once you've charged up.

326
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,154
Mr. Ju Seok-hoon is here.

327
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,627
Why does Ju Seok-hoon
keep showing up here?

328
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,466
Something's fishy.

329
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:15,800
It just doesn't make sense.

330
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:17,719
What do you mean?

331
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:21,181
Mr. Jeong… No, I mean Director Jeong.

332
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:23,099
He's only recently survived
a deadly attack.

333
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,268
So how could he have recovered so quickly?

334
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,729
Now that you mention it,
something's definitely off.

335
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:29,689
Let me see.

336
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,317
I'd say the heavens helped him.

337
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,568
Or his ancestors did.

338
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:35,320
You and your superstitions.

339
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,997
Maybe he has a secret.

340
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:47,707
A secret?

341
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,543
Maybe he's been hogging
something good for himself.

342
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:51,544
What?

343
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,512
A secret, huh?

344
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:13,483
This is nice.

345
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:18,196
Since I missed the board meeting
and everything,

346
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,948
I wanted to see you.

347
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,409
Are you okay?

348
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,326
Yes.

349
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,037
I'm doing a lot better than I expected.

350
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,216
That's a relief.

351
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:43,430
Do you remember going
to that tattoo parlor with me in the US?

352
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,141
You said

353
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:49,060
you were scared of needles
and that you'd never get a tattoo.

354
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,770
I was drunk for this one.

355
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,356
I didn't even feel a thing.

356
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,862
You've been acting out of character a lot

357
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,948
since you met Mr. Jeong.

358
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,080
Do-hee.

359
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,040
Don't you…

360
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,377
regret your decision at all?

361
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:18,423
No, I don't regret it.

362
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,470
Thanks, Seok-hoon.

363
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,431
And I'm sorry.

364
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,400
Mr. Jeong.

365
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,528
Can we talk?

366
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,492
He likes me too much.

367
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,041
How are you?

368
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,296
Good as new.

369
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,884
You seemed to be in critical condition.

370
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,303
I tend to recover fast.

371
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:10,266
Vampires stay young
by consuming human blood.

372
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,311
What's your secret?

373
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,772
Again with that vampire nonsense?

374
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,650
Are you that interested in the occult?

375
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,401
It's not the occult
that I'm interested in.

376
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,989
I'm interested in you, Mr. Jeong.

377
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,871
You're smitten with me, aren't you?

378
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,666
Are you into men?

379
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:37,502
Mr. Jeong.

380
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,755
What do you get
from your relationship with Do-hee?

381
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:44,384
I don't see how you'd benefit
from being her husband and bodyguard.

382
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:45,718
I need her.

383
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,430
If that were true,

384
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:53,810
you wouldn't just be sitting back
as she gives up on something important

385
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:56,145
because of you.

386
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,856
We're finally on the same page.

387
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,733
I don't plan on just sitting back.

388
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,360
Are you happy now?

389
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,948
The secret to my recovery
is a thirst for revenge.

390
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,075
I couldn't possibly die
without paying back

391
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,785
the one who did this to me.

392
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:23,089
DO DO-HEE

393
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,385
I'm free now.

394
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:29,804
I can finally go outside
without a bodyguard.

395
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,723
Congratulations, ma'am.

396
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,479
Why don't we grab a drink to celebrate?

397
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,820
I forgot what a goody-goody you are.

398
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:48,656
Let's do it.

399
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,284
Just one drink though.

400
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:55,622
MIRAE GROUP TO ELECT CHAIRMAN
AT STOCKHOLDER MEETING

401
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:58,124
It seems like
Ms. Do has officially given up.

402
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:05,006
I don't think things should end this way.

403
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,427
Something doesn't feel right.

404
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,511
Exactly.

405
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,514
Speaking of which,

406
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,351
can you draw a sketch of half a face?

407
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,606
What do you think?

408
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:25,193
Hey, you're quite talented.

409
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,444
A lot more so than you look.

410
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,112
How do I look?

411
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,489
Now, mirror it.

412
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,039
The hide-and-seek is over.

413
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,462
SUNWOL FOUNDATION

414
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,887
This is the boss's workplace.

415
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,641
Let's keep it safe and clean ourselves.

416
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:58,768
Stay in line!

417
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:04,816
Make sure the boss
doesn't breathe in a speck of dust!

418
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:17,120
-Move along!
-Yes, sir!

419
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,039
Who are you?

420
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,417
-I'm the assistant director here.
-Are you sure?

421
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,670
Look, the bags under my eyes
are the proof.

422
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,089
-Pass!
-Pass!

423
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,009
Director Jeong.

424
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,594
I need you down at the theater.

425
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:37,348
Please come and kick these mongrels out.

426
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:43,771
The boss is here.

427
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,027
Hello, boss.

428
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,987
-Hello, boss!
-Hello, boss!

429
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,990
I said I wasn't your boss.

430
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,576
What's with the illegal occupation?

431
00:33:56,659 --> 00:34:00,288
Oh my. You're all working so hard.

432
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:04,125
Please have a drink. Great job.

433
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,252
Kick these mongrels out.

434
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:09,130
The performance is coming up.
They'll scare the audience away.

435
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:14,469
Thank you so much for your hard work.

436
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,764
So you call yourselves Deulgaepa,
as in "wild dogs"?

437
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,140
Yes, boss.

438
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,808
-Yes, boss!
-Yes, boss!

439
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,270
You know what your name also sounds like?

440
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,814
Deulkkaepa,
as in perilla seeds and scallions.

441
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:35,823
My goodness.

442
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,493
You're funny, boss.

443
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,203
Our name, the Wild Dogs,

444
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:44,040
symbolizes our fearlessness
and doggedness…

445
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:49,212
Hereafter, we will be known
as the soul of Korean cuisine,

446
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,005
the Perilla Seeds and Scallions!

447
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:55,259
-The Perilla Seeds and Scallions!
-The Perilla Seeds and Scallions!

448
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:56,928
Anyway,

449
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,014
I have a task for you.

450
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,018
If you fail,

451
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:08,189
I forbid you to show up
in front of me ever again.

452
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,817
We're ready to risk our lives, boss!

453
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,569
-As you say, boss!
-As you say, boss!

454
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:20,284
Let's go!

455
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:24,163
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

456
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:39,345
Director Jeong,
I guess you sorted everything out.

457
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,305
You quit being
her bodyguard and husband, right?

458
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,435
I warned you, didn't I?

459
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,521
After all I've said,

460
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,773
do you really want to become
an insignificant human?

461
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,569
Do you know what it's like to be human?

462
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,321
Every day feels like walking on thin ice,

463
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,991
and we use that as an excuse
to prey on each other.

464
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:02,785
Humans are the most cowardly
and despicable beings in the world.

465
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:07,081
You were perfect because you were a demon.

466
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,750
Death, love, fear…

467
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,170
You were who you were

468
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,588
because you were free from those things.

469
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,755
Stop it.

470
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:18,134
I'm not giving up on Do Do-hee
no matter what.

471
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,719
And I'm not giving up on you.

472
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,847
I can't just watch you
jump into this fiery pit.

473
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,142
This is your last warning, Jin Ga-young.

474
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:29,437
Don't cross the line.

475
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,486
What's so special about her?

476
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,698
What makes her worth
putting everything on the line?

477
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,586
Star Jin.

478
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,214
How about

479
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:59,634
we wish the two of them happiness?

480
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,261
If the price of their happiness
is this high,

481
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,264
it can't be true happiness.

482
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:25,660
Let me do it.

483
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,620
No, I'll do it.

484
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:35,628
Cheers.

485
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,771
It's so nice
to be drinking in the open air.

486
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,856
I'm glad it's to your liking.

487
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,820
My journey has finally come to an end,

488
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,239
although it ended in an unexpected way.

489
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:09,120
Letting go turns out to be
easier than I thought.

490
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:13,040
It makes me wonder
why I've been holding on so desperately.

491
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:17,670
Sometimes, we bet everything on something
without even knowing why.

492
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:22,842
Maybe we only find out why
after the journey has ended.

493
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:27,054
What could be the reason for my journey?

494
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,682
I'm not sure.

495
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:35,521
Ms. Shin.

496
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,317
How was your marriage?

497
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,361
My ex was incredibly lame.

498
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:47,199
I didn't know it was possible
to love and loathe someone

499
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,076
in such a short span of time.

500
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:53,873
But now that I've come out the other side,

501
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,416
I understand myself better.

502
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,836
Had it not been for him,

503
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:02,048
I would've never known
the pathetic, shameful,

504
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:04,133
weak, and strong parts of myself.

505
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:06,844
That's what my marriage meant to me.

506
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:15,102
I didn't know
you had such passion within you.

507
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,562
Neither did I.

508
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:21,108
I've never loved anyone
before or after him.

509
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,528
I've been lukewarm all my life,
neither hot nor cold.

510
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:28,074
But I have no regrets
since I've boiled once.

511
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,160
That must be the reason for your journey.

512
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:32,078
That's right.

513
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,915
Growth can only happen after destruction.

514
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,214
Cheers.

515
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,174
Come on, raise your glass.

516
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:47,885
Bottoms up.

517
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,603
DO-HEE THE NUTJOB

518
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,065
Where are you, hubby?

519
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,860
Do Do-hee, your hubby is…

520
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:09,323
Do Do-hee's happiness train
is now departing!

521
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,672
The real mongrels were here.

522
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:31,011
What's wrong, Do-hee?

523
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,889
-Da-jeong.
-What?

524
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:35,933
-Da-jeong.
-What?

525
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:40,729
I'm sorry for making you work
so late all the time.

526
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:43,107
It's okay.

527
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,401
You pay me a lot anyway.

528
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:47,987
I guess I do.

529
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,239
-Here.
-Do Do-hee!

530
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,950
You better

531
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,621
get your act together.

532
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:07,631
Hold on.

533
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,550
What is it?

534
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,135
Why are we laughing?

535
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:15,306
No idea.

536
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,190
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

537
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,987
My wife is being embarrassing.

538
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,239
Why don't we go home now?

539
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,659
The sun is up.

540
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,119
It's so blinding.

541
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:41,123
The sun is up

542
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:44,043
Twinkle, twinkle…

543
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:46,295
Da-jeong! Where do you think you're going?

544
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:48,797
-Let's have another round.
-I have to get to work.

545
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,717
It's 9 a.m. I'm late.

546
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:53,552
I'm late!

547
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:54,970
Huh?

548
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,476
All humans are obliged
to get drunk on happiness!

549
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:01,727
Let's go!

550
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,978
Okay!

551
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:06,065
It's not alcohol that we're drinking.

552
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:09,652
It's happiness.

553
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:10,986
Stop drinking!

554
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:12,738
Jeong Gu-won!

555
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:14,365
You better

556
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,910
get your act together.

557
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:27,044
You shouldn't throw up your happiness!

558
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:29,421
Wait, stay seated.

559
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:32,007
Mr. Park, someone needs your help.

560
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,926
Hurry over here.

561
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,135
Are you okay?

562
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:42,268
Bottoms up.

563
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,858
Park Fork-you.

564
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:51,443
You better

565
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,863
get your act together.

566
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,865
My name's Bok-gyu, not Fork-you.

567
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,200
Fuck-you.

568
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,955
We're off.

569
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,417
That's enough.

570
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,337
Hubby,

571
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,423
give me a piggyback ride.

572
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:21,348
Just how much did you have to drink?

573
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:24,393
I'm feeling super happy.

574
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,605
It's like a huge weight
lifted off my chest.

575
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:30,065
I feel so free and happy.

576
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,485
And that makes me feel bad.

577
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,740
Because I'm the only one who's happy.

578
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,995
I feel so sorry for Madam Ju.

579
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,753
-Hubby, how about one more lap?
-Yeah?

580
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:55,132
Sure, but do you know
how many laps we've done?

581
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:56,842
Beats me.

582
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:00,095
Just one more lap, please?

583
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,347
Are you sure?

584
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,140
Can't you do that much for me, hubby?

585
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,310
Fine.

586
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,479
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

587
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,523
-Run!
-Okay, should I run?

588
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:14,985
-Here we go.
-Run, demon, run!

589
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:32,628
You and your diligence.

590
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,215
You're even diligent in giving up.

591
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,108
Look.

592
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:57,653
Just where is your place out of all these?

593
00:44:57,736 --> 00:45:00,030
Tell me exactly where you live.

594
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,283
Why do you want to know where I live?

595
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:07,246
To take you home.

596
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,667
What is it?

597
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,378
What's that look?

598
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,758
You're a kind man.

599
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:25,764
I'm just following
Director Jeong's orders here.

600
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,892
You're also responsible.

601
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,021
You've got to be kidding me.

602
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:39,278
You look cute when you smile.

603
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:40,446
That's all true,

604
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,489
but tell me where you live.

605
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,036
Where are we?

606
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:51,623
What do you mean? This is where you live!

607
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:55,544
This isn't where I live.

608
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,465
Seriously?

609
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,802
When did the moon get so fat?

610
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:11,393
There are still two more days left
until the full moon.

611
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:12,394
That's a relief.

612
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:15,981
Ms. Shin!

613
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,274
My goodness.

614
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:20,694
-These are from the boss.
-Yes, sir!

615
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:22,905
-Stay alert, okay?
-Yes, sir!

616
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:24,031
Let's do this!

617
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,407
Memorize his face.

618
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:26,783
Memorize it. We can do…

619
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,660
That stings! Your stupid necklace!

620
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,287
-Gather up!
-Yes, sir!

621
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,330
Savory and spicy!

622
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:32,956
-Go, Perilla Seeds and Scallions!
-Go, Perilla Seeds and Scallions!

623
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,416
-Go get him!
-Yes, sir!

624
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:37,961
Look at me!

625
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,547
-Stop eating.
-Show me your face.

626
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,465
These are women!

627
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,218
-Let's go in!
-Yes, sir!

628
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:47,221
This is our chance to impress the boss.
Find him!

629
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,392
Who are you?

630
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:58,857
ABRAXAS HAS ENTERED THE ROOM

631
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:09,409
It might become troublesome later,
so let's nip it in the bud.

632
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:21,296
What?

633
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,339
I think it's him.

634
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,302
NAME: GI KWANG-CHUL

635
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:40,023
BLUE NIGHT THEATER

636
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:04,590
You're here.

637
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:08,760
The most suitable ending
for the devil that I could think of

638
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:10,637
was hellfire.

639
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,182
It comes up in the book too.

640
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:17,686
Spontaneous combustion.

641
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:25,193
I'll be doing the Lord's work.

642
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,571
Let me tell you,

643
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:31,158
I'm not a murderer but an artist.

644
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,581
Do you know

645
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:42,544
what makes humans
greater than the devil or God?

646
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:45,213
Humans

647
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,342
can become anything.

648
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:53,430
Be it the devil, God,

649
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:56,892
or even something more than that.

650
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:56,076
Noh Suk-min, you son of a bitch.

651
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,753
Did I ever tell you this?

652
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,715
Thank you

653
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,384
for getting me out of prison.

654
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:15,429
I didn't know

655
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:18,140
I'd be repaying you this way.

656
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:24,312
Damn.

657
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:32,738
You'll be killed
by the devil you set free.

658
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,504
Shit!

659
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:33,715
Open the door!

660
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,051
Noh Suk-min!

661
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:39,721
Open the door!

662
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:41,807
This can't be happening.

663
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:45,894
Noh Suk-min, this isn't right.

664
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:47,270
Open the door.

665
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:54,778
Hey!

666
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,905
Open the door!

667
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,806
You killed someone
on top of all your dirty tricks?

668
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:28,728
You brought this upon yourself, Mother.

669
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,748
I REALIZED I'D GIVEN BIRTH
TO THE DEVIL'S SPAWN…

670
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,917
PERHAPS I'M AT FAULT…

671
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:54,296
YOU PAY FOR YOUR SINS
AND I'LL PAY FOR MINE

672
00:52:58,842 --> 00:52:59,759
CEO DO DO-HEE

673
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:46,973
My head is killing me.

674
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:52,270
Here.

675
00:53:58,193 --> 00:53:59,110
Thanks.

676
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:00,612
Nothing happened, right?

677
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:03,531
Madam Ju always made sure
I behaved while drunk.

678
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:07,827
Jeez, that old woman.

679
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,085
DETECTIVE PARK KYUNG-SOO

680
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:16,795
Yes, Detective?

681
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:19,839
We found the culprit, Ms. Do.

682
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:20,757
We got him, boss.

683
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,510
Your Perilla Seeds and Scallions
found him.

684
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:25,428
We found his hideout.

685
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:26,680
His name is Gi Kwang-chul.

686
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,556
He has countless charges
of murder and assault.

687
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,893
He's currently on our wanted list,
so we'll be able to track him down soon.

688
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,480
BLUE NIGHT THEATER

689
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:21,943
He looks more ordinary than I expected.

690
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,779
This seemingly ordinary man
had killed countless people.

691
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,614
How did he die?

692
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:28,283
It was arson.

693
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:32,078
What's strange is that
his corpse was abused.

694
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:37,667
Someone stuck a 20 cm-long knife
into his heart

695
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:39,836
after his body completely burned.

696
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:44,841
As if to leave a message.

697
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:51,056
It hurts, doesn't it?

698
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:52,390
See you in hell.

699
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:04,235
Well then…

700
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:06,988
Do-hee.

701
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:09,282
So the culprit's dead?

702
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:13,119
-Yes.
-What happened, Detective?

703
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:14,871
Well…

704
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:17,665
I need to go check something.

705
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,877
Could you go home with Ju Seok-hoon?

706
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,099
I heard the culprit got caught.

707
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,148
What are you looking for?

708
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:46,736
Now that the culprit is dead,
it's all over, isn't it?

709
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:48,613
What's that?

710
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:51,199
Is that a bug?

711
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:52,700
I was right.

712
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:55,662
The culprit got killed
because I saw his face.

713
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:58,331
How would anyone know
that you can find people with faces?

714
00:56:58,414 --> 00:56:59,749
It's not even written in the…

715
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,294
Is that how you figured out
we were bugged?

716
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:06,506
I finally saw the culprit's face,

717
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:08,007
but the real culprit…

718
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,053
went hiding behind the dead one.

719
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,700
-Excuse me.
-Yes, ma'am?

720
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:36,327
Just a second.

721
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:51,968
You just woke up?

722
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:57,223
Another golf outing?

723
00:57:57,307 --> 00:58:00,477
I have a lot of people to see
before the stockholders' meeting.

724
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,978
That sounds tough.

725
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:04,397
-Please continue.
-Yes, ma'am.

726
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:34,511
You must've been shocked.

727
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:37,347
Yeah.

728
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:40,892
I didn't know my invitation to end the war

729
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:43,144
would be met with this response.

730
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:44,812
So what does it mean?

731
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:46,856
I guess the war is over.

732
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:48,858
They've eliminated their weapon.

733
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,444
Do you really think this is the end?

734
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,029
It has to be.

735
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:56,699
It has to be over.

736
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:01,788
The secret to my recovery
is a thirst for revenge.

737
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:04,040
I couldn't possibly die
without paying back

738
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:06,167
the one who did this to me.

739
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:10,838
How did you find the culprit?

740
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:12,215
You didn't know his face.

741
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:14,342
Gu-won saw his face

742
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:17,595
when he got attacked.

743
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:19,847
So he's the one who found him.

744
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:24,811
Do-hee.

745
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,982
How much do you trust Mr. Jeong?

746
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:32,527
What do you mean?

747
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:37,198
Don't tell me you're suspecting him.

748
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:42,412
He would never.

749
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:44,247
-But Do-hee…
-Seok-hoon.

750
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:45,999
Gu-won

751
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:48,626
had always been there to protect me.

752
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:53,881
It's all over now.

753
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,968
Let's stop talking about it.

754
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:07,270
See if this can lead us
to the real culprit.

755
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:08,396
Director Jeong,

756
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:10,898
I suggest we lie low for now.

757
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:14,027
The knife was clearly a warning.

758
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:17,614
If they've been eavesdropping,
they must know your powers are acting up.

759
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:20,575
If you act rashly, you'll get hurt.

760
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:25,163
Also, there will finally be
a full moon tomorrow.

761
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:27,707
You can go back to
being your perfect self.

762
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:30,376
So wait just one day and…

763
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:52,440
The clocks…

764
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:54,734
What about them?

765
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:04,702
They've stopped.

766
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,640
SEOUL HANSE MEDICAL CENTER

767
01:01:25,723 --> 01:01:29,394
I'm here to visit Lee Yeon-seo
in the pediatric oncology ward.

768
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:32,063
You mean the Yeon-seo
who already got discharged?

769
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:33,773
I heard she's back in the hospital.

770
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:34,774
That can't be.

771
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:37,193
She's our hospital's symbol of miracle.

772
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:41,823
-It's dropping.
-What's her oxygen level and temperature?

773
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:44,575
It's at 95%,
and her body temperature is 30°C.

774
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:46,744
-Mommy's here, Yeon-seo.
-Let's raise the body temperature first.

775
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:48,496
Hang in there, sweetie!

776
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:50,331
Yeon-seo!

777
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:52,959
Oh no…

778
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:55,378
So your name's Yeon-seo?

779
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:58,047
Do you have a wish?

780
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:02,260
I hope my parents
won't have to suffer because of me.

781
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:04,303
That's my wish.

782
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:15,273
My powers weren't just flickering.

783
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:18,609
They're completely gone.

784
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:47,597
No.

785
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:14,040
JESUS CORP.
DAEGUK BANK

786
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:21,714
What?

787
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:24,842
You know something about me, don't you?

788
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:30,264
You've become completely human.

789
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:32,892
What on earth is going on?

790
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:35,436
Tell me.

791
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:37,980
For free?

792
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:53,037
Long time no see.

793
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,414
-Let me show you to your table, ma'am.
-Sure.

794
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,752
-It's been a while.
-You're looking good.

795
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,003
-Hi there.
-Hi.

796
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,797
-Long time no see.
-Have fun.

797
01:04:11,138 --> 01:04:14,559
I'll have my usual, but make it two.

798
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:15,893
Understood, ma'am.

799
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:21,107
Have a seat.

800
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:28,155
Are you a regular here?

801
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:32,326
Humans tend to judge others
by their appearances.

802
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:34,161
How come they treat you so nicely?

803
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:35,955
It's as if they were under hypnosis.

804
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:39,417
I'm not sure.

805
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:43,838
They must be able to recognize
my true worth beyond my appearance.

806
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:50,386
Excuse me.

807
01:04:53,097 --> 01:04:54,140
Thank you.

808
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:28,633
Is this really the right place
to discuss something like this?

809
01:05:29,383 --> 01:05:30,343
Is that so?

810
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:42,813
What?

811
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:44,315
Not up your alley?

812
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:49,987
I suppose this isn't quite your style.

813
01:06:15,554 --> 01:06:16,389
Who…

814
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:19,016
are you?

815
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,435
Why are you so surprised?

816
01:06:22,436 --> 01:06:25,064
I can do everything you can.

817
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:27,400
Because I gave you those powers.

818
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:58,723
SUNWOL FOUNDATION

819
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:12,528
Are you…

820
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:15,948
God?

821
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:20,411
That's one name I have.

822
01:07:20,494 --> 01:07:23,205
Some call me the universe.

823
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:25,583
Others call me time.

824
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:27,835
You know what they say.

825
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:31,630
"God is everywhere and in everything."

826
01:07:32,923 --> 01:07:33,758
To me,

827
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:37,094
that sounds like God is nowhere.

828
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:40,014
Just as defiant as a demon should be.

829
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:43,851
To think we've traveled
halfway around the world

830
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:46,145
for blasphemy.

831
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:48,064
I believe you,

832
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:50,274
so give me back

833
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,276
my powers.

834
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:54,403
I can't do that.

835
01:07:55,654 --> 01:07:58,032
-What?
-Even though I gave you the powers,

836
01:07:58,115 --> 01:07:59,825
I didn't take them away from you.

837
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:07,208
Did this happen
because I haven't made a new deal?

838
01:08:07,291 --> 01:08:10,836
Can I get my powers back
if I make one right now?

839
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,339
Deals won't change anything.

840
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:15,299
Since the powers are in the wrong body,

841
01:08:15,382 --> 01:08:18,803
it's only natural for them to fade
until they're completely gone.

842
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:23,140
Then I'll…

843
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:26,018
That's right.

844
01:08:27,311 --> 01:08:29,522
You're dying as we speak.

845
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:42,576
You seem to care about Do Do-hee a lot.

846
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:47,706
Few people would go to these lengths
even for their immediate families,

847
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,292
much less for their cousins.

848
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:52,294
Do-hee is more than family to me.

849
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:58,926
We have something in common.

850
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:03,305
So tell me.

851
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,724
Why did you want to see me?

852
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:08,018
I assume you know

853
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:11,021
Mr. Jeong's true identity.

854
01:09:14,066 --> 01:09:15,985
Then how can I get my powers back?

855
01:09:16,068 --> 01:09:17,653
There must be a way.

856
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:22,825
It's simple.

857
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:26,745
He's a demon.

858
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:30,124
Also known as the devil.

859
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:38,215
You can get your powers back

860
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:40,301
once the woman dies.

861
01:10:07,661 --> 01:10:09,788
He brings misfortune upon humans

862
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:11,999
and leads them to hell.

863
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:07,680
At the full moon,
the roulette wheel will come to a stop,

864
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:09,265
and the game will end one way or another.

865
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:10,724
Let's stay up all night tonight.

866
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:13,811
I just feel like
it'd be a waste if we slept tonight.

867
01:11:13,894 --> 01:11:16,021
We never went on our honeymoon.
This can be it.

868
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:17,731
What scares me is a world without you.

869
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:20,943
Like I said, I'm going to fix you up.

870
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:25,197
The only thing you can do for him is die.

871
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:26,949
You mean nothing to me.

872
01:11:27,032 --> 01:11:28,033
I won't give up on either one of us.

873
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:30,035
I'm choosing both me and Do Do-hee.

874
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:32,579
Let's make a bet.

875
01:11:34,581 --> 01:11:39,586
