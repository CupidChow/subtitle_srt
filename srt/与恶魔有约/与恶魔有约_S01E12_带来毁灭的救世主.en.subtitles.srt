1
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:44,044
Is there such thing

2
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:47,213
as a given fate?

3
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,722
If there is,

4
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,558
is it impossible

5
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,228
for us to escape the frame of fate…

6
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,982
that repeats itself?

7
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:30,173
EPISODE 12
THE SAVIOR OF DESTRUCTION

8
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,098
Good morning, Young Master.

9
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,267
It's a beautiful day, Young Master Yi-sun.

10
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:44,479
-Good morning, Young Master.
-Good morning, Young Master.

11
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,064
Young Master!

12
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,320
I used to be human.

13
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,448
My mere presence

14
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:58,243
was enough to inspire
the entire village's love and respect.

15
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,536
I was that special.

16
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,705
Young Master!

17
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,915
Young Master Yi-sun!

18
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,004
Stop whining, will you?

19
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,757
Stop calling my name. You'll wear it out.

20
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,969
Your tutor will arrive any minute.
You can't go flower-watching right now.

21
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,930
Your father will have a fit
if he finds out.

22
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:21,558
Everyone will be happy
as long as you keep quiet.

23
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,725
My mouth can't be kept shut.

24
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:23,977
It's structured that way.

25
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,854
Anyway, you can't go.

26
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,230
If you must go,

27
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:31,317
please don't step on me
because that hurts, but step over me.

28
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,402
For goodness' sake!

29
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,405
That's even better.

30
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,574
I'll have the scenery all to myself.

31
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,284
He really stepped over me.

32
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,079
You snuck out without telling me!

33
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,665
I had no idea!

34
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,208
He's so stubborn, isn't he?

35
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,671
The best spot should be
somewhere around here.

36
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,738
Wait!

37
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:02,992
It's cold!

38
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,084
My apologies for the interruption.

39
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,544
I came here
to take a break from my studies.

40
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,838
Please don't be scared.

41
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,924
I'm not a suspicious person. My name is--

42
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,217
Seo Yi-sun.

43
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:23,054
Every single person in this village
knows your name.

44
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,141
I suppose
I'm quite well known in this village.

45
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,185
On the other hand,

46
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,062
I've never seen you before.

47
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,606
I assume you came from another village.

48
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,192
Otherwise, there's no way
I wouldn't know a beauty like…

49
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,152
Then again,

50
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,989
I'm too occupied with my studies
to converse with any ladies.

51
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,323
That may be why.

52
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,366
Is that so?

53
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,244
That's not what the rumors say.

54
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,537
What rumors?

55
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,248
You're a precious only son
from a prestigious family.

56
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,833
You neglect your studies,

57
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,960
but your father
refrains from disciplining you

58
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,587
since you lost your mother
to an illness at a young age.

59
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,131
As a result, you're known to be

60
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,008
the most carefree loafer in the world.

61
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,010
You seem

62
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,762
very interested in me.

63
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,058
While you know everything about me,

64
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,394
I know nothing about you.

65
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,062
What is your name?

66
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,064
Young Master!

67
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,150
Young…

68
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,569
Young Master Yi-sun!

69
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,822
How could you just leave me…

70
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,951
Wait!

71
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,711
Why are you looking at me like that?

72
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:39,797
You got yourself another reason
to neglect your studies.

73
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,926
-Once I set my mind to my studies--
-In any case,

74
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,595
she's as beautiful as people say.

75
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,931
Do you know who she is?

76
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,767
I do.

77
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,685
Which noble family does she come from?

78
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,521
She doesn't come from a noble family.

79
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,399
She's a government courtesan
who recently moved here from Hanyang.

80
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:00,777
A courtesan?

81
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,239
I heard that she was well-known in Hanyang
for her dance skills and intelligence.

82
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:08,409
I wonder why she moved
all the way to this small village.

83
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,579
Was it to meet me?

84
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,458
What was her name again?

85
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,213
What is her name?

86
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,010
-Have a drink, my lord.
-Please have a drink, my lord.

87
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,096
-All right then.
-You look great today.

88
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,105
Wolsim at your service.

89
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,157
What?

90
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,951
This is unacceptable!

91
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,245
She is said to have been haughty
in Hanyang as well.

92
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,413
What an insolent woman.

93
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:57,834
Wolsim.

94
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,339
So that's her name.

95
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,062
My apologies.

96
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:23,901
I came over the other day
because I wanted to see you.

97
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,404
I apologize if I was being rude.

98
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,533
How exactly were you being rude?

99
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,788
I can't quite pinpoint it, but…

100
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,915
Please don't apologize
if you don't know why.

101
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,460
Wait…

102
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,307
Young Master!

103
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,852
I know you'd rather sleep than eat,

104
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,271
but take a break from lazing around
now and then,

105
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,191
or you'll ruin your health.

106
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:06,527
Who are you?

107
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,112
Are you still half asleep?

108
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,114
You've served me all your life.

109
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,158
But you never wake up this early.

110
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,951
-What happened?
-Seok.

111
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,747
I've decided to focus on my studies
starting today.

112
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,207
Why is that?

113
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,042
This is who I really am.

114
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,877
I'll get you some medicine.

115
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,985
"Xu Fan asked about benevolence."

116
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,821
"Confucius answered
that it meant to love others."

117
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:51,864
What are you doing?

118
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,033
My lady!

119
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,493
What a coincidence!

120
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:58,829
Is it?

121
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,874
I was reading The Great Learning
while listening to the waterfall

122
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,210
to appreciate nature
and study at the same time.

123
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,130
You must be here for the same reason,

124
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,007
but it'd be indecent of us to be together.

125
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,511
So you'll have to
take the spot over there.

126
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,054
This spot is taken.

127
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,059
"Xu Fan asked about wisdom."

128
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,478
"Confucius answered
that it meant to understand others."

129
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,284
COMMENTARIES ON GREAT LEARNING

130
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,138
Do you live here or something?

131
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,978
I seem to focus better when I study here.

132
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:10,151
It doesn't look like you're studying,

133
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,152
if you ask me.

134
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,040
"If the cause is not right,
the command is not followed."

135
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,710
"If the command is not followed,
the work is not accomplished."

136
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,253
How insightful!

137
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,290
Don't worry.

138
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,500
I'll go get it.

139
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,169
But it's dangerous.

140
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,345
I've trained in swordsmanship,
archery, and spearmanship for years

141
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,139
to strengthen my mind and body.

142
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,432
This should be a piece of…

143
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,730
A piece of cake.

144
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,150
I'll be right back.

145
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,280
But…

146
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,198
Don't you worry.

147
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:25,744
Young Master!

148
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,164
Young Master!

149
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,084
Stop there!

150
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,919
Wait for me!

151
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,216
Young Master!

152
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,761
Young Master!

153
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,221
Young Master Yi-sun!

154
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:49,977
Young Master!

155
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,938
Young Master Yi-sun!

156
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,568
I found it!

157
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,529
I, Seo Yi-sun, found it!

158
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,951
My lady.

159
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,958
Here's your shoe, my lady.

160
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:13,918
I found it.

161
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,586
What were you thinking?

162
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,671
Who cares about a shoe?

163
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,466
What if something bad happened?

164
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,510
Were you

165
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,887
worried about me?

166
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,725
Why would I worry about you?

167
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:33,938
Don't ever do this again.

168
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,779
Are you all right?

169
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,533
I've trained in swordsmanship,
archery, and spearmanship…

170
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:50,829
Give me that.

171
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,289
No, I will do it.

172
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,169
Dry your clothes first.

173
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,213
No, I'm almost done.

174
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:28,117
Nothing beats the warmth
of one's body temperature.

175
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,715
You'll burn my shoe.

176
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,678
Come on.

177
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,430
I'm cold.

178
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,842
What is Hanyang like?

179
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,971
I assume it's much bigger
and more exciting than this village.

180
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,601
It is much bigger,
more crowded, and noisier indeed.

181
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,897
So how did you end up here?

182
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,862
I'm sorry for being nosy.

183
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,826
I refused to dance
for a high-ranking official.

184
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,705
I may be a lowly courtesan,

185
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,417
but I can't seem to even move a finger

186
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,544
when I don't feel like dancing.

187
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,677
After I, a lowly courtesan, declined
the request of someone so powerful,

188
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,555
I'm thankful to even be alive.

189
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,269
There must have been a reason…

190
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,900
why you couldn't bring yourself to dance.

191
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:39,790
To think I get to enjoy seeing you dance
even when an eminent man couldn't.

192
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,625
I don't know how to repay you.

193
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:47,881
You've already repaid me.

194
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,092
Have I?

195
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:12,823
It's a firefly.

196
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,472
I love you, Wolsim.

197
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,237
I thought that you felt the same way.

198
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,158
It's time to wake up from this dream.

199
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,412
The most foolish human emotion

200
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,997
is love.

201
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,624
I don't mean this lightly.

202
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,544
I would like to marry you.

203
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,587
We can't get married.

204
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,464
Given my class,

205
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,717
I can be your concubine at best.

206
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:57,886
Let's elope.

207
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,929
If we run away--

208
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,473
We can't run away from the world forever.

209
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,308
As long as the world remains the same,

210
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,728
so will our fate.

211
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,273
Wolsim.

212
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:11,191
You said there must've been a reason

213
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,820
I refused to dance
and was expelled from Hanyang.

214
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,198
That day,

215
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:21,535
my dearest friend took her life.

216
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,454
She was

217
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,416
in a romantic relationship
with a nobleman.

218
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,626
Contrary to popular belief,

219
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,255
love can't save a person.

220
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,924
It only weakens us

221
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,428
and drags us into the depths of misery.

222
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,692
I'll show you…

223
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,864
that love can save a person.

224
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:06,205
If we must sink into the depths of misery,

225
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,251
I'd gladly…

226
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,796
do so with you.

227
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:49,498
Wolsim!

228
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,584
Wolsim…

229
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:54,586
Young Master.

230
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,966
What if someone sees you here?

231
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,842
I found something incredible.

232
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,219
SEVEN VIRTUES AND VICES OF CATHOLICISM

233
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,972
This is Western learning, isn't it?

234
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:08,600
That's right. This book says
that all humans are born equal.

235
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,643
Isn't that amazing?

236
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,144
Here, take a look.

237
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,111
We were in love,

238
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,447
but we had been struck
by the class barrier.

239
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,702
To us, the new learning
that spoke of equality

240
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,288
seemed like salvation.

241
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,583
-Our Father, Who art in heaven,
-Our Father, Who art in heaven,

242
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,128
-hallowed be Thy name.
-hallowed be Thy name.

243
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,963
-Thy kingdom come.
-Thy kingdom come.

244
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:41,383
-Thy will be done on earth
-Thy will be done on earth

245
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,552
-as it is in heaven.
-as it is in heaven.

246
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,847
-Give us this day our daily bread
-Give us this day our daily bread

247
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,641
-and forgive us our trespasses
-and forgive us our trespasses

248
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,810
-as we forgive
-as we forgive

249
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,812
-those who trespass against us.
-those who trespass against us.

250
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,565
-And lead us not into temptation,
-And lead us not into temptation,

251
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,526
-but deliver us from evil.
-but deliver us from evil.

252
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,736
-Amen.
-Amen.

253
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,490
"The Lord is the ancestor of all beings

254
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,492
and the creator of all things."

255
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,162
"Therefore, all descendants of the Lord

256
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,914
may protect themselves

257
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,042
by relying on His love."

258
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,627
If we all are equal
as the Lord's children,

259
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:21,048
shouldn't we all speak the same way
regardless of class?

260
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:23,925
That's right.

261
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,469
Yi-sun.

262
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,348
Say that again.

263
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,893
Seo Yi-sun, you little brat.

264
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,520
Who knew being talked down to
would feel so good?

265
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,442
I hope this will spread throughout Joseon.

266
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,277
Then everyone will be addressed
by their first name

267
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,446
and treated with respect.

268
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,156
When that day comes,

269
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,326
we'll be able to get married.

270
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,953
When do you think that day will come?

271
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:55,332
Wolsim.

272
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:58,418
I'd like to pass the state examination.

273
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,631
Rather than waiting
for the world to change,

274
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,049
I'd like to change it myself.

275
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,263
Perhaps

276
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,849
we believed in each other
more than anything.

277
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:18,230
We were quickly swept up
by the fragile yet perilous belief

278
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:22,067
that we could be happy together

279
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,195
and infected each other
with the conviction.

280
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,156
Little did we know

281
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,493
the dire consequences that awaited us.

282
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,870
She's a government courtesan.

283
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,372
Her name is Wolsim.

284
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:39,626
Young Master has been
associating with Catholics, including her,

285
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,169
and I'm worried sick.

286
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,921
What should we do?

287
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:48,927
Wolsim!

288
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,224
-Young Master.
-Wolsim.

289
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,311
The journey to Hanyang will be difficult.

290
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,897
And I heard that bandits
are running rampant these days.

291
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,108
Please be careful.

292
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:04,359
Don't worry.

293
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:07,070
I'll come back safely and marry you.

294
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:11,408
The last thing I see before I die

295
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,953
will be your face.

296
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,799
Something to remember me by
while I'm away.

297
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,367
I'll never take it off

298
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,578
until you come back.

299
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,083
Please don't forget me.

300
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,506
I would rather forget myself

301
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:12,469
than forget you.

302
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:35,617
Young Master.

303
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:39,371
We haven't got all day.

304
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,251
Let's go.

305
00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:00,267
Recently, a man abolished
the memorial service for his late mother

306
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:04,479
and committed the atrocity of burning
and burying the ancestral tablet.

307
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:10,110
This was due to the despicable teachings
of the vicious followers of Catholicism.

308
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:13,738
They take turns holding gatherings
called the Six Meetings in their homes

309
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:17,033
where men and women sit together
and spread immoral beliefs.

310
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:20,036
They go so far as to hold meetings
at courtesan houses.

311
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,955
It is extremely deplorable indeed.

312
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,958
The recent heinous incident happened

313
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,210
because no action
had been taken against them.

314
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,713
At this rate, this land of courtesy

315
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:32,173
built on Confucianism
with 4,000 years of history

316
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,968
will end up in the hands
of beasts and scoundrels.

317
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,678
To prevent that,

318
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:40,432
we shall behead them and display
the severed heads to warn everyone.

319
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,310
We shall also nail their doors shut

320
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,895
and burn their villages to the ground.

321
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:50,025
The nearby village is in ruins.

322
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:53,028
At this rate,
our village will be no exception.

323
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,739
It is clear that the Noron faction
is using the Catholics

324
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,657
as an excuse to bring us down,

325
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,409
but there's nothing we can do.

326
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,787
If sacrifice is inevitable,

327
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,542
we shall sacrifice only one person.

328
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,019
Cruel times arrived.

329
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,482
And in cruel times,
a scapegoat is needed.

330
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,650
To save their own lives,

331
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,778
people did not hesitate
to point the finger.

332
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,654
It's that courtesan, I swear!

333
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,448
-It's her!
-It's certainly her!

334
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:39,824
-It's her!
-I saw it!

335
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:43,536
Everyone is saying
that you're the only Catholic here.

336
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:48,166
But do you think
I'm after a mere courtesan?

337
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:00,887
This can't possibly belong
to a lowly courtesan like you.

338
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,641
Who gave it to you?

339
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,105
Answer me,

340
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,482
and I'll spare your life.

341
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,737
It is mine.

342
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:21,908
It has always…

343
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,995
belonged to me.

344
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,416
But there was

345
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,668
one person

346
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,337
who sacrificed herself

347
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,173
to save her loved one.

348
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,094
Hooray!

349
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:10,790
Wolsim!

350
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,128
Young Master…

351
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,096
Young…

352
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,309
Wolsim.

353
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,738
Love can't save a person.

354
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:46,534
It only weakens us
and drags us into the depths of misery.

355
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,411
I'll show you

356
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,748
that love can save a person.

357
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,918
If we must

358
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,878
sink into the depths of misery,

359
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,464
I'd gladly…

360
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,258
do so with you.

361
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,226
Thirsty for revenge

362
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,478
and blinded by fury,

363
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,523
I turned evil.

364
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,287
If heaven is where God dwells,

365
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:14,998
I refuse to go there.

366
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,668
I killed…

367
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,088
you.

368
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,478
My faith…

369
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,147
caused

370
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:23,816
her death.

371
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,194
Did you sleep well?

372
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,708
Here.

373
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,335
It's your favorite, pour-over coffee.

374
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,548
You look haggard.

375
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:29,632
Are you not feeling well?

376
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:34,470
I just had a dream.

377
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,680
A dream?

378
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:39,976
You said a demon didn't need sleep,
but you even had a dream?

379
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,854
What was it about?

380
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:48,192
I dreamed about when I was human.

381
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,655
Did you get your memory back?

382
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,365
A little bit.

383
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:58,369
What kind of person were you?

384
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,164
I'm curious.

385
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,085
I…

386
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,965
was in love with someone.

387
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,218
Her name was Wolsim.

388
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,810
So the dream wasn't about you

389
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,021
but your ex?

390
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:29,108
Gosh, I can't believe this.

391
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:30,985
Was she pretty?

392
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,447
Did you two have a happy ending?

393
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,578
Don't tell me you had a sad ending.

394
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:45,041
We had an ordinary
and insignificant ending

395
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,000
like everyone else.

396
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,463
I'll go wash up.

397
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,961
That's what I'm talking about.

398
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:38,344
Could you give us some privacy?

399
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,105
So you unlocked your memories.

400
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:53,359
I did.

401
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:58,030
I killed myself
so I wouldn't end up where you were,

402
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,908
but you turned me into a demon.

403
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,286
I needed a worker.

404
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:06,414
Not just in heaven but also in hell.

405
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,876
When your grudge against humans
met the needs of God,

406
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,544
a demon was born.

407
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,257
How could you reward my faith…

408
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,969
with such a tragic death?

409
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,305
Faith is an inherently dangerous thing.

410
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,933
Perhaps more dangerous than anything else.

411
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,351
Don't you even feel guilty?

412
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:31,355
How can you not feel guilty
when even lowly humans can?

413
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:36,485
Who are you so angry with, me or yourself?

414
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:40,573
Or could it be because of your fear
of fate repeating itself?

415
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:43,534
That you'll end up
making her suffer again?

416
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:46,829
What are you talking about?

417
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,414
As I said,

418
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,957
fate is bound to repeat itself.

419
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:56,005
That must be why your tattoo transferred.

420
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:59,300
That got you two entangled
so that the misfortune could strike again.

421
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,509
Shut up!

422
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,862
It's a fate that you created.

423
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:24,492
You're simply paying for what you've done.

424
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,138
Fate…

425
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,151
Director Jeong.

426
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,241
I think I found out about your past life.

427
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:08,995
Do you know what your full name was?

428
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,038
Seo Yi-sun.

429
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:12,832
How did you know?

430
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,208
My memories…

431
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:16,919
have returned.

432
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,464
Do you also remember how you died?

433
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,803
I understand you a lot better
now that I've learned about

434
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:28,222
Seo Yi-sun's unfortunate life.

435
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,599
No wonder you loathe humans.

436
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:32,935
Anyway,

437
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,896
if you remember everything now,

438
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,814
tell me about Wolsim.

439
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,025
She's Do Do-hee.

440
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,444
No way.

441
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,362
Our encounter

442
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:45,990
wasn't a coincidence.

443
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:49,201
Could it be
that you started becoming human

444
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,786
the moment you met her?

445
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:55,374
You told me your powers started acting up
and your tattoo transferred

446
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,876
when you first met her.

447
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,544
I must be right.

448
00:38:58,627 --> 00:38:59,628
Until now,

449
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,465
we thought the loss of your powers
turned you into a human,

450
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,175
but it was the other way around.

451
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,176
In other words,

452
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:08,471
meeting a significant person
from your past life triggered your change,

453
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,765
and that's why your powers flickered.

454
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,516
It's a chicken-egg situation.

455
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:19,190
Are you going to tell her?

456
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:23,819
No.

457
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,323
It's best she doesn't know.

458
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:33,788
WOLSIM

459
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,959
Wolsim.

460
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,463
That rings a bell.

461
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,759
He seemed to avoid talking about her.

462
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,844
Does he still have feelings for her?

463
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,226
I just sounded like an obsessive wife.

464
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:57,853
I should watch myself.

465
00:39:58,979 --> 00:39:59,814
Come in.

466
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,777
I've uploaded
the sales data for the new product.

467
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,154
Ms. Shin.

468
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,658
Let's say you've had memory loss.

469
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:14,078
How would you feel
if you suddenly got your memory back?

470
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:17,415
-That came out of nowhere.
-Just imagine.

471
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:20,334
Your old memories come flooding back.

472
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,461
You'd be very confused, right?

473
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,548
You'd be surprised and flustered.

474
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:29,009
The best thing one could do for you
in that situation

475
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,928
would be to patiently stay by your side.

476
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:33,055
I suppose.

477
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:37,685
Thank you for clearing that up for me.

478
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:38,936
My pleasure.

479
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,613
I saved the world.

480
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,491
I shed blood for all of you.

481
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,244
Do-gyeong.

482
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:56,912
Hang in there a little longer,

483
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,290
and your dad will get you out of here.

484
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:03,210
So take your medicine regularly

485
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,087
and take care of…

486
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,179
You knew everything, didn't you?

487
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,055
You knew everything…

488
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:18,976
but turned a blind eye.

489
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,188
You only care about yourself.

490
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:25,691
Do-gyeong.

491
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,026
I took the bullet for you.

492
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:29,195
I protected you.

493
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,908
You're…

494
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,161
the real evil one.

495
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:43,375
I've been good all my life.

496
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,546
That's why I'm not being punished.

497
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:49,757
Then…

498
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:53,427
what about me?

499
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:56,555
What about me?

500
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:00,851
What did I do wrong?

501
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:07,816
You…

502
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,653
disobeyed your father.

503
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,863
You didn't live the way he wanted.

504
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,535
That's why you're being punished.

505
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:20,663
You deserve it.

506
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:22,331
It's your fault.

507
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:43,978
Noh Do-gyeong!

508
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,479
Calm down, Noh Do-gyeong!

509
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,815
Calm down!

510
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:54,446
It's your turn now.

511
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:17,970
I'll take that one.

512
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:19,763
That one too.

513
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,767
It's for a good cause, right?

514
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:27,479
Yes, all the proceeds will be donated
to the Children's Welfare Association.

515
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:28,772
That's great.

516
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:29,732
I'll take this too.

517
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,447
Hello, Kim Se-ra speaking.

518
00:43:58,761 --> 00:43:59,803
Mr. Jeong.

519
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,726
Thank you for the gift.

520
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:08,687
I'm fine now, thanks to you.

521
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,481
I didn't do it because I liked you.

522
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,025
But you're not telling me off

523
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:16,236
for being here again today.

524
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:20,157
Do-gyeong's psychiatric evaluation results
are out.

525
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,409
From intermittent explosive disorder

526
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,704
to extreme anxiety and depression,
he's in serious condition.

527
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,666
He was basically a ticking time bomb.

528
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:31,502
Had it not been for you,

529
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:34,797
Do-hee couldn't have made it unscathed.

530
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,842
Thank you.

531
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:41,136
And…

532
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,473
I'm sorry

533
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:47,017
for misunderstanding you until now.

534
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,606
There's no misunderstanding.

535
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:06,453
Hello, Detective Park.

536
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:13,585
Do-hee.

537
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:16,463
Do-gyeong's psychiatric evaluation results
are out.

538
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:20,968
Noh Do-gyeong…

539
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:24,680
is dead.

540
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:53,959
THE LATE NOH DO-GYEONG

541
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,171
Have some water.

542
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:40,923
I'm okay.

543
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,717
You must be in shock.

544
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:49,014
Please let me know
if I can help you with anything.

545
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,117
This can't be easy for you.

546
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,160
Thank you for coming.

547
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,372
He's the one who killed Madam Ju.

548
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,041
Of course I should see him off.

549
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:18,752
I should've apologized to you
in person sooner,

550
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:24,466
but I had a hard time accepting
that my son was such a monster.

551
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,719
I'm sorry, Do-hee.

552
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,555
I've failed as a parent.

553
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,727
So he killed himself?

554
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,604
He must've been overwhelmed

555
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,731
by the guilt for what he had done.

556
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:42,693
I don't think
his death makes up for what he did.

557
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:46,071
I promise to make it up to you
one way or another.

558
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,490
So for the sake of the company,

559
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:51,868
please keep a lid on this matter.

560
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,537
Are you worrying about the company

561
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,456
even in this situation?

562
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,875
My mother and your father
founded this company together,

563
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,586
pouring their blood and sweat into it.

564
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,212
Imagine if people found out

565
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:06,925
that my mother was killed by
her mentally ill, money-hungry grandson.

566
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:09,303
The company would take a huge blow.

567
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:12,014
Also, if this gets out,

568
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:15,017
everyone in the family will get hurt.

569
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:19,021
It's for the sake of both the family
and the company.

570
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:23,108
You're part of the family after all.

571
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:28,405
It seems like family means more to the one

572
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,491
who has more to lose.

573
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,248
See you soon.

574
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,670
Where's Noh Do-gyeong, that devil's spawn?

575
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:47,674
How could he kill his own grandmother?

576
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:49,635
Su-ahn.

577
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,512
Your son killed our mom.

578
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,556
It wasn't a heart attack.

579
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,308
It was murder!

580
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:57,768
Bring her back.

581
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,603
Bring her back right now!

582
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:04,441
I feel so sorry for her.

583
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,946
What are you going to do now?

584
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:13,575
Bring her back!

585
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:18,914
Let's go.

586
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:20,999
It's suffocating in here.

587
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,253
I'm sorry, Su-ahn.

588
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,214
It's all my fault.

589
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:30,342
Our poor mom.

590
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,475
Do you remember
what Do-gyeong was saved as

591
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:40,268
in Gi Kwang-chul's phone?

592
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,105
Abraxas?

593
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,357
I knew it sounded familiar,

594
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,776
and it's from the novel Demian.

595
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:51,196
"The bird fights its way out of the egg."

596
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:52,906
"The egg is the world."

597
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:55,367
"To be born,

598
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,244
one must

599
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:00,664
first destroy a world."

600
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,999
"The bird flies to God,

601
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,544
whose name is Abraxas."

602
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:07,879
Did Noh Do-gyeong have no choice

603
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:10,424
but to kill Madam Ju
in order to spread his wings?

604
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:13,719
That's his way of justifying his crime.

605
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,138
It's despicable.

606
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:17,264
Did he

607
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,099
really not know?

608
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:20,600
Do you mean Noh Suk-min?

609
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,728
How could he have been oblivious…

610
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:27,107
to what Noh Do-gyeong was up to?

611
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,401
I just don't understand it.

612
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:42,164
How about

613
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:44,875
we go see Madam Ju?

614
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,057
I've lost both my mother and son.

615
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,853
You're all I have left now.

616
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:07,230
We're not even that close.

617
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,024
We haven't been until now,

618
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:12,486
but let's try to get along
as each other's only family.

619
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:16,823
And Austin and Justin
are the only future heirs

620
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,867
of Mirae Group now.

621
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:39,721
Madam Ju.

622
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,516
It's all over now.

623
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:44,643
Even so,

624
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:47,437
nothing seems to have changed.

625
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:52,317
Noh Do-gyeong ran away from his sins.

626
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:54,653
And I'm still upset.

627
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,447
Will I be able to get over it

628
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,574
after time passes?

629
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:06,790
Tell me.

630
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:10,710
Can you get over everything with time?

631
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:14,506
You should know
since you've lived for 200 years.

632
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,976
You can't.

633
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:27,853
You just…

634
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:30,814
forget what happened…

635
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,317
for a short while.

636
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:39,990
I knew it.

637
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,285
I'll get going.

638
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:45,662
I promise to be in a better mood
next time.

639
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:51,501
Let's go.

640
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:12,147
So tell me.

641
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:15,734
Other than cotton candy and sunsets,

642
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:17,319
what else do you like?

643
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:20,697
I like all kinds of sweets.

644
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:25,702
It seems like sweets can make
everyone feel like a child again.

645
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,748
And…

646
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,585
I also like you, Bok-gyu.

647
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:38,173
You're silly.

648
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:44,763
These are tears of joy.

649
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,101
I almost forgot.

650
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,272
Here.

651
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:55,315
What's this?

652
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:58,234
Please come see our performance tomorrow.

653
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,363
-No thanks.
-Why?

654
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:03,365
We should keep our work
and personal lives separate.

655
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:05,951
I don't want to disturb your work.

656
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:07,285
Don't say that.

657
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:10,038
It'd mean so much if you came.

658
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:13,750
It's the sea!

659
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:16,711
-Hurry up, Ms. Choi.
-It's amazing!

660
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:20,006
We'll part ways after just one beer.

661
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,300
-You have to eat ramyeon at the Han River.
-It's the PR team!

662
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:23,802
We should have fried chicken too.

663
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:26,388
-Love isn't a crime, is it?
-Let's grab a spot.

664
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:27,889
Where should we sit?

665
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,064
Mr. Han, Ms. Choi, over here!

666
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:37,649
Nice!

667
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:39,818
This is so nice.

668
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:49,285
Hey.

669
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:51,162
Let's go somewhere else.

670
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:52,747
Why? I like this spot.

671
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:54,082
Can't you tell?

672
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:55,500
They're having an affair.

673
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:57,794
Are they?

674
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,505
-Let's go.
-What's with them?

675
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:01,673
It's not an affair!

676
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:03,967
My goodness.

677
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,844
Is she eating him up or what?

678
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:07,345
It's so violent.

679
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:08,972
Let's go.

680
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:11,808
What a shame. I like it here.

681
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:16,646
-Be quiet.
-Let's go somewhere else.

682
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,440
No, come back here!

683
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:22,694
SUNWOL FOUNDATION

684
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:23,987
You look gorgeous!

685
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:25,113
I love you!

686
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:27,699
-Ga-young!
-Please make a heart toward the camera!

687
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:28,658
Ga-young!

688
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:30,618
-You look beautiful!
-Wave at the camera!

689
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:32,078
I love you more!

690
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,455
I love you!

691
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:35,040
Please make a heart!

692
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:36,708
You look gorgeous!

693
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:38,918
-Please look over here!
-You're so pretty.

694
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:41,546
Wait a second, please.

695
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,673
Congratulations.

696
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:46,801
Thank you.

697
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:52,223
I'm leaving Korea
right after the performance.

698
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:55,018
I won't bother you anymore.

699
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,105
Are you leaving for good?

700
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,775
I only had sad memories here
except for Director Jeong.

701
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,195
And now, he's no longer the exception.

702
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:12,327
Director Jeong and Star Jin
have to pose for the cameras.

703
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,579
Do me one last favor.

704
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:18,458
Please focus on your duties
as the executive director tonight.

705
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:20,794
Let's go.

706
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,340
Let's start again.

707
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:28,134
Executive Director Jeong Gu-won
is here as well.

708
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,763
Please stand close to each other.

709
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:04,170
Do you know why I got into dancing?

710
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,883
It's because of the painting
of the double-sword dance in the lobby.

711
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:15,140
I loved the look in Director Jeong's eyes
when he gazed at it.

712
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,433
There was this sadness and warmth to it.

713
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:21,563
The emotional look in his eyes
was so unlike him,

714
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:24,149
and I wanted it so badly.

715
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:30,238
I hoped that if I danced hard enough,

716
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:35,452
he would someday look at me that way.

717
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,162
That's why.

718
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:40,582
But instead,

719
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:45,086
he ended up looking at Do Do-hee that way.

720
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,302
Even though I've lost him to her,

721
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:55,138
I still have dance in my life.

722
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,916
I seem to focus better when I study here.

723
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:07,502
It doesn't look like you're studying.

724
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,514
I love you, Wolsim.

725
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:23,768
Seo Yi-sun, you little brat.

726
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:25,812
Who knew being talked down to
would feel so good?

727
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:30,441
The last thing I see before I die

728
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:33,611
will be your face.

729
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:42,245
I'll never take it off

730
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:44,539
until you come back.

731
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:48,710
If heaven is where God dwells,

732
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:50,336
I refuse to go there.

733
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:14,902
Gu-won.

734
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:20,033
Are you okay?

735
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:32,795
When I was human,

736
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:39,135
I killed people.

737
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:43,222
I killed a lot of people…

738
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:46,934
who loved me…

739
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,647
and whom I loved.

740
01:00:57,945 --> 01:01:00,073
Was there a reason?

741
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:03,743
I'm not sure.

742
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:06,371
They had sacrificed…

743
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,957
the woman

744
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:12,669
I loved.

745
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:21,552
It's my fault.

746
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,476
If I hadn't loved her,

747
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,438
she wouldn't have died.

748
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:45,952
That's what frightens me.

749
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:50,581
I might…

750
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,006
make you miserable.

751
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:10,393
I'll be miserable without you anyway.

752
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:19,819
If I end up miserable either way,

753
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:24,073
I want us to be miserable together.

754
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:30,079
I'll show you

755
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:34,125
that love can save a person.

756
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:38,629
If we must

757
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:41,174
sink into the depths of misery,

758
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:43,551
I'd gladly…

759
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:46,971
do so with you.

760
01:02:57,315 --> 01:03:00,860
Is there such a thing

761
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,154
as a given fate?

762
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:09,744
If there is,

763
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:11,913
I'm determined

764
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,333
to give us a happy ending this time.

765
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,011
Look at that!

766
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:23,943
Lord,

767
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:27,321
defend us in battle.

768
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:32,827
Be our protection against
the wickedness and snares of Satan.

769
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:36,414
Cast into hell

770
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:38,708
Satan and all the evil spirits

771
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:42,670
who prowl around the world

772
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:45,590
seeking the ruin of souls.

773
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:56,517
I saw the devil.

774
01:05:24,545 --> 01:05:27,632
MY DARLING DAUGHTER DO-HEE

775
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:34,597
If there is such a thing

776
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:36,974
as fate,

777
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:41,771
within that inescapable frame of fate,

778
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:44,273
will we be

779
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:46,859
destroyed

780
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:48,986
or…

781
01:05:50,237 --> 01:05:51,739
saved?

782
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:44,458
I don't want to repeat
my unfortunate past with Do-hee.

783
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,210
I'll make it a happy ending.

784
01:06:46,293 --> 01:06:48,546
-I love you, Jeong Gu-won.
-I love you too.

785
01:06:48,629 --> 01:06:50,172
Whatever you want, Do-hee.

786
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:51,590
There's not even enough time
to make you happy!

787
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:54,260
Happiness can sometimes be poisonous.

788
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:55,386
Let me ask you something.

789
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:57,096
Did you really not know
what Do-gyeong was up to?

790
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:58,514
Or did you just turn a blind eye?

791
01:06:58,597 --> 01:07:00,933
I thought you were oblivious,
but were you only pretending?

792
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,476
Just how much do you know?

793
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,145
You think your parents died
in an accident.

794
01:07:04,228 --> 01:07:05,521
They were killed by Ju Cheon-suk.

795
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:13,112
