1
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,516
THE WORD COMES FROM
THE ANCIENT GREEK WORD "DAIOMAI,"

2
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,351
WHICH MEANS "TO SHARE THE SAME FATE"

3
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:05,273
DEMONS ORIGINALLY EXISTED AMONG HUMANS

4
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:10,236
AND PROTECTED THEM AS THEIR GUARDIANS

5
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:29,297
My life feels as if it's shrouded in mist.

6
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,982
Who is a friend and who is a foe?

7
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:52,987
Or is everyone around me a foe?

8
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,323
I can't tell.

9
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:00,203
Is the one approaching me through the mist

10
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,624
a devil or an angel?

11
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,962
Have they come to save me

12
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:11,339
or to destroy me?

13
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,809
The truth is so fragile

14
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,188
that even the faintest mist can hide it.

15
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:34,904
EPISODE 1
LIVING IN THE MIST

16
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:39,993
Let us pray.

17
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,578
200 YEARS AGO, JOSEON

18
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,413
Almighty God,

19
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,498
please guide us

20
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,835
to always remember your will

21
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,129
and empower us to apply it

22
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,548
through our words and actions.

23
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,676
It is said

24
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,138
that evil spirits
seek to deceive your followers

25
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:05,101
by quoting the Bible, your holy word.

26
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,699
MAY THIS HOLY WATER CLEANSE ME OF MY SINS
AND PROTECT ME FROM EVIL SPIRITS. AMEN.

27
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,829
Evil spirits seek to separate us from God

28
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,124
and steal his power and glory.

29
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,252
To resist their temptations,

30
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:32,795
we must…

31
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:51,898
What is that?

32
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,276
It's blood!

33
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,947
It's the devil!

34
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:27,141
I CAN DO ALL THINGS THROUGH HIM
WHO GIVES ME STRENGTH, PHILIPPIANS 4:13

35
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,644
My dear.

36
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,611
Stay away.

37
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,705
I'm incredible as usual.

38
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,001
Catholics believe

39
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,295
that humans have three kinds of enemies.

40
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,465
The first is their own bodies,

41
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,135
which undermine them from within
with traits such as laziness.

42
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,972
The second is their worldly lives,

43
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,100
which eat away at them from the outside.

44
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,394
Their third and final enemy

45
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:36,938
is evil spirits.

46
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:42,401
You look like you have been
starving for days.

47
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,655
Who isn't these days?

48
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:49,158
Is your wish to be free from hunger?

49
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,410
I do not know who you are,

50
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,162
but not even His Majesty can solve--

51
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,872
The sea is full of fish.

52
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,041
Look how they shine in the water.

53
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,301
What the…

54
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:12,849
I know. You must be a goblin.

55
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,184
How dare you compare me
to such an ugly and lowly spirit?

56
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,227
Then the Dragon King?

57
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,020
I'm not an old man like him.

58
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,939
-The nine-tailed fox?
-They shed fur everywhere

59
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,107
and smell like dogs.

60
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,859
Then what are you?

61
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,778
I am a demon from the underworld.

62
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,155
What?

63
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,865
You humans call me

64
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,700
an evil spirit.

65
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,455
Am I so hungry that I'm seeing things?

66
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,041
Goodness, I must be dying soon!

67
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,462
What's that?

68
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,726
Were you serious?

69
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,436
My goodness!

70
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,066
It's not for free though.

71
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,610
You need to make a deal with me.

72
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:06,777
A deal?

73
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,654
The deal will last for ten years.

74
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,948
And you will never go hungry
in that period

75
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,283
since that is your wish.

76
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,701
What happens afterward?

77
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,495
Your body will die,

78
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,330
and your soul
will end up where I come from.

79
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,207
What kind of place is that?

80
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,042
You humans seem to call it

81
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:22,793
hell.

82
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,504
Hell?

83
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,094
My mouth waters
just by looking at my own flesh.

84
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,804
Hell can't be worse than here.

85
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:37,350
-Give it here.
-You're a lot braver than you look.

86
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,186
What? How do I look?

87
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,980
Shall we go ahead and sign it?

88
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,816
This thing looks interesting.

89
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,195
What are you doing? It hurts!

90
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,780
"One must sign with one's own blood."

91
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:51,697
That's the rule.

92
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,032
What's your name?

93
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,535
Park Bok-gyu.

94
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,911
Park Bok… What?

95
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,121
-Bok-gyu.
-"Bok-gyu."

96
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,289
Bok-gyu.

97
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,083
What a peculiar name.

98
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,459
Look at this!

99
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:13,970
Evil spirits deceive and confuse humans
in their arrogant yet tempting ways,

100
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,515
undermining them
from both the inside and the outside.

101
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:22,520
However, who has ever seen an evil spirit?

102
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,439
Even if they were to exist,

103
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,983
they are but external forces.

104
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,403
See you in ten years.

105
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,364
I can't believe this.

106
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:37,159
Thank you, Buddha!

107
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,203
You're thanking the wrong guy.

108
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,874
While it is true that external forces
can lead people astray,

109
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,253
all evil ultimately stems
from human desires.

110
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,672
So the fault cannot lie
in the evil spirits alone.

111
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:04,228
2023 KOREA CEO AWARDS

112
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,244
Anything without caffeine, please.

113
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,834
Are you a part-timer?

114
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,504
I knew the non-alcoholic mojito
would be a hit.

115
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,298
Do you trade stocks?

116
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,008
I mean, who doesn't, right?

117
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,928
If you do, I bet you've heard of
Hanmyeong Investment and Securities.

118
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:38,846
Take it.

119
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:46,854
There are hundreds of people
waiting in line for my advice,

120
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,523
but I'm willing to let you cut in line.

121
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,527
-The reason being?
-You're probably making chump change.

122
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,905
All that struggling
with the rent and bills

123
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,532
will age that pretty face of yours.

124
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,117
It just breaks my heart.

125
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,954
Let me buy you a drink later.
Give me your number.

126
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:07,124
We will now announce the CEO of the Year

127
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,127
for the F&B Industry.

128
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,837
I ask the winner to step onstage.

129
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,674
You can call my secretary
regarding any investment inquiries.

130
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:19,095
All that struggling to cover drinks
and bills with your meager salary

131
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,431
will make you lose your hair quickly.

132
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,641
It just breaks my heart.

133
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,023
Hey, you're one ambitious man.

134
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,567
Hitting on the Mirae Group's princess?

135
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,486
-Princess?
-She's an Instagram sensation.

136
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,071
They call her the IU of the dessert world

137
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,948
and Kim Yun-a of the F&B industry.

138
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,034
Mirae F&B has received the highest rank

139
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,327
for two consecutive years.

140
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,329
"The Devil in Hermès"?

141
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,331
Congratulations, Ms. Do Do-hee!

142
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,421
Hello, I'm Do Do-hee.

143
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,266
[EXCLUSIVE] MIRAE F&B'S CHILLING JUICE
PACKED WITH SUGAR?

144
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,230
They deliberately blurred the lines
between fructose and sugar.

145
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,940
Someone's using cunning tactics.

146
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,024
Who did this?

147
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,734
I'm looking into it.

148
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,070
Who would be the most envious
of our performance?

149
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,489
Our competitors or affiliates.

150
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,324
My money's on a power grab
within the group.

151
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,326
I'll prioritize that possibility.

152
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,871
Let's head straight to the office.

153
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:28,747
We can't.

154
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,292
This isn't the time for a blind date.

155
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,586
ALMIGHTY JU

156
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,254
You can't avoid this forever.

157
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:38,048
-You know how the chairwoman--
-I certainly do.

158
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,176
Hi, Madam Ju.

159
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,261
Are you on your way?

160
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,891
Yes, I just arrived.
How's your checkup going?

161
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,310
It's going to start soon.

162
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:52,855
There's something I've got to tell you.
An issue came up at work, and…

163
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,691
So you want to cancel the date?

164
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:58,110
Let me first take care of work
and put a hold on--

165
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,904
Let's put a hold on the checkup too.

166
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,238
All right, fine.

167
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,907
I'll go on the date, okay?

168
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,200
Forget it.

169
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,911
I understand you hate blind dates.
That's okay.

170
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,412
I hate checkups too.

171
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,747
I didn't say that.

172
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,123
I like blind dates.

173
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,542
Who wouldn't like to meet someone
over a fancy meal?

174
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:15,669
Is that so?

175
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,838
I'll enjoy myself on the date,

176
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,381
so make sure to get a thorough--

177
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:21,425
Let's get started.

178
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:30,476
How long should I stay
to avoid being rude?

179
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,395
I would say at least 30 minutes.

180
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,398
Okay. You should go grab
something to eat, Ms. Shin.

181
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,984
I'll go and spend 30 minutes
sitting like a doll.

182
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:47,117
I guess you could call Chucky
from Child's Play a doll too.

183
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,876
-I'm back, boss.
-All right.

184
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,132
Kim signed the business rights waiver.

185
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,050
I suppose he's not a complete idiot.

186
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,928
He knows how to save his own skin.

187
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,327
What the…

188
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,205
What's wrong with this thing? Is it stuck?

189
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,174
Who's that?

190
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,777
Don't tell me you forgot.

191
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,737
Is it today already?

192
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,531
How could you forget
such an important day?

193
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,325
I guess I was the only one who cared.

194
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,419
CRIME AND PUNISHMENT

195
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,677
Wouldn't it be amazing

196
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,179
to have unlimited time
at the flip of an hourglass?

197
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,472
Hold on.

198
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:14,890
There must be another way.

199
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,392
We could extend our contract.

200
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,894
No, how about we sign a new contract?

201
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,437
You know better.

202
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,107
There's no point in resisting.
Let's have a beautiful goodbye.

203
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,111
I'm not going anywhere!

204
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,404
I won't! Go away!

205
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,363
Don't come near me!

206
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,532
Stay back!

207
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,702
Then again, no human would willingly die.

208
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:38,038
I'm glad to see you being so human
for once in your last moments.

209
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,958
Please give me one more chance.

210
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,377
You have no idea how I got here.

211
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,170
I do know. You got here thanks to me.

212
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,507
Since your wish
was to obtain wealth and power,

213
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,051
I would have fulfilled that for you
regardless of what you did.

214
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,553
All you did was choose the method.

215
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,721
I'll give you anything.

216
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:57,891
How about 10…
No, 100 other lives instead of mine?

217
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,352
That's not a bad deal for you, is it?

218
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,146
I love my job.

219
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,230
Do you know why?

220
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,982
The deal is fair to everyone.

221
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,109
The only thing that I want

222
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,194
is the other party's soul.

223
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,488
Nothing else.

224
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,202
What was that?

225
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,420
The boss is full of energy today.

226
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,173
He solved a major pain in his neck.

227
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,591
He must be in a good mood.

228
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,137
I can't breathe.

229
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,891
You'll die of a heart attack.

230
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,602
What is hell like?

231
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,854
Is it as bad as they say?

232
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,857
The lazy are sent to
endlessly run on millstones

233
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,903
while hellfire burns so intensely
it melts your flesh and bones.

234
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,866
But that's all in the past.

235
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,454
That's child's play

236
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,164
compared to where you're going.

237
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,750
You never explained that to me.

238
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,503
You never asked.

239
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,215
You would've ended up in hell
even without our deal.

240
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,925
You had nothing to lose.

241
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:16,178
I'd say you made a pretty smart choice.

242
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,681
This may sound ridiculous,

243
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,935
but that's quite comforting to hear.

244
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,682
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR JEONG GU-WON

245
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,448
I'm sorry, but we're fully booked.

246
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,160
A customer booked the entire place.

247
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,204
Unbelievable.

248
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,123
She even told him today's my birthday?

249
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,959
You have a male customer, right?

250
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,419
I'm his guest.

251
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,129
Then let me show you to your table.

252
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,175
Over there, ma'am.

253
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,512
What's all this fuss?

254
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,389
He could be Madam Ju's soulmate.

255
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,142
Why not just marry him herself?

256
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,981
I didn't know
that people still read print newspapers

257
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,232
outside of planes.

258
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:53,775
Is it just for show?

259
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,446
I'll have you know

260
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,906
that I'm married to my work.

261
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,074
I have no interest in men…

262
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:05,579
whatsoever.

263
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:16,173
Marry your work
or your pillow for all I care.

264
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,424
How is it any of my concern?

265
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,718
If you must share personal information,

266
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,637
I'd prefer your bank account password.

267
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:27,267
Did we go to school together
by any chance?

268
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,519
-Highly unlikely.
-Did we used to go out?

269
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,065
Then you'd remember me.

270
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,692
So you're not my school friend or my ex.

271
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,111
Then where are your manners?

272
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,198
All human beings

273
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,408
are insignificant to me.

274
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,662
What's up with this handsome nutjob?

275
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,172
I'm keeping my end of the bargain.

276
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,548
You better be too.

277
00:20:58,632 --> 00:20:59,758
Almighty.

278
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,761
Why must I bear this hardship?

279
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:05,305
30 MINUTES

280
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,223
START

281
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,857
I booked this entire restaurant
to have a quiet meal.

282
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:16,817
Sounds good.

283
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,110
It'll be nice and awkward.

284
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,238
If you want to eat,
there are other restaurants.

285
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,782
Then you leave.
You obviously know a lot of places.

286
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,287
What's up with this hardcore nutjob?

287
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:36,795
Excuse me.

288
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,716
I'd like two of these.

289
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:44,594
I'd also like
the strongest wine you have, please.

290
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:45,512
Certainly, sir.

291
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,057
Garlic steak…

292
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,310
"Do Do-hee."

293
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,228
Myers-Briggs type, ISTJ.

294
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,022
She probably can't empathize as a T.

295
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:58,525
LOST HER PARENTS AT 11 YEARS OLD
ADOPTED BY MIRAE GROUP'S CHAIRWOMAN JU

296
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,659
What is he, a little kid?

297
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,497
I was admiring your youthful spirit.

298
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,543
I do look a lot younger than my age.

299
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,505
You obviously weren't looking for a meal,
so tell me.

300
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,632
Why do you insist on staying?

301
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,052
I'm going to stay for 30 minutes
just to be polite.

302
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,094
Polite to whom?

303
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,263
You're being absolutely rude to me
by staying.

304
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,557
I'm like a mirror.

305
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,893
I'm reflecting your rude behavior.

306
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:39,107
We should make up excuses
on why this didn't work out.

307
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,609
Why don't you say…

308
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,779
you were intimidated by my beauty?

309
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,947
Why are you doing this to me?

310
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,491
It's not like I want to do this.

311
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,284
I'm just following orders from above.

312
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,328
"From above"?

313
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:54,790
I wouldn't dare defy
the sacred word of the Almighty.

314
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,878
Who the hell…

315
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,588
I mean, who are you?

316
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:02,506
I almost forgot.

317
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,050
We should introduce ourselves properly.

318
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,220
CEO DO DO-HEE

319
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,722
"Do Do-hee"?

320
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,312
Give me yours.

321
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,398
Unlike you, I don't enjoy
disclosing personal information.

322
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,110
I understand you were forced
to be here just like me,

323
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:26,029
but we should work together
to get through this.

324
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,540
"Jeong Gu-won."

325
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,127
As in "salvation"?
It doesn't suit you at all.

326
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,046
"Sunwol Foundation"?

327
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,548
That rings a bell.

328
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:48,468
My foundation supports traditional artists
such as traditional singers and dancers

329
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,595
and regularly produces
superb traditional performances.

330
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,556
How are you not familiar with
such a reputed institution?

331
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,559
Shouldn't you try to be more cultured?

332
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,644
Tradition, tradition, tradition…

333
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:58,854
That's all I hear.

334
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,772
I'm all for tradition,

335
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,358
but my life is more like modern warfare

336
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:06,069
than a little concert at a pavilion.

337
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,904
So what's the sacred plan?

338
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:08,989
Don't tell me

339
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,700
you got roped into this
without any details.

340
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,704
Talk about a blind date.

341
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:16,621
A date?

342
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,540
You must also be a handful,

343
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,667
considering they tricked you
into coming here.

344
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,254
So what exactly is going on here?

345
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,173
A blind date.

346
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,883
We're being set up.

347
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,427
Are you saying

348
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:34,055
God is setting me up with you?

349
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,977
Calling her God is a bit much,

350
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,938
even for the Almighty Ju's soulmate.

351
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,024
"Almighty Ju"?

352
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,444
Is that who you meant by "the Almighty"?

353
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,288
You must be in shock.

354
00:24:58,872 --> 00:24:59,915
Interesting.

355
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,334
No other human has made me this nervous.

356
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,753
I'm glad at least one of us enjoyed this.

357
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,632
I'm sorry, but we're fully booked.

358
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,342
Sorry to spoil the fun,

359
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,886
but Cinderella's time is up. Bye.

360
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,831
Cold but kind.

361
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,333
Innocent yet sexy.

362
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:47,379
His whole existence exudes sensuality.

363
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,634
That was close.

364
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,973
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

365
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,978
My precious cake almost got ruined.

366
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,077
What was that?

367
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,538
Maybe he isn't such a jerk after all.

368
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,665
He even prepared a cake for my birthday?

369
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:32,549
Darn it.

370
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:48,815
You little bastard!

371
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,150
Who sent you?

372
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:51,901
What did you do to our boss?

373
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,737
Hold on.

374
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:57,157
I made a reservation a month ago

375
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,284
and sat through
a boring course meal for this.

376
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:01,202
So let me have a taste first.

377
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:24,017
It won't come off.

378
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,733
But how could he make such a move on me
without any warning?

379
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:34,611
Or was he being subtle?

380
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,905
That was close.

381
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,951
I should have been more careful.

382
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:46,164
I must've let my charm shine through
without realizing it.

383
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:50,627
So I was the first woman
to make him that nervous?

384
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,297
No other human has made me this nervous.

385
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,844
What's this?

386
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,222
No way. I'm blushing?

387
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,515
My face is all red!

388
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:04,641
What on earth?

389
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,184
Get it together, Do Do-hee.

390
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,519
Your name literally means "haughty."

391
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:08,895
This isn't your first rodeo.

392
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,482
There are different types of trash.

393
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:13,775
What type are you?

394
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,861
Recyclables? Food waste?

395
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,988
Don't you realize what's going on here?

396
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,324
Doesn't seem like I can recycle you
for anything else,

397
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,410
nor do you seem nutritious at all.

398
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,871
So you must fall under general waste.

399
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,001
Beat him up.

400
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,809
-What the hell?
-What happened?

401
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,352
Where did he go?

402
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,562
You try.

403
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,773
IT'S NEVER TOO LATE FOR YOUR HAIR!

404
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:04,576
TAKE ACTION BEFORE YOU LOSE MORE HAIR

405
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,706
-Hold on.
-Wait a second.

406
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,082
We have to get him together.

407
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,001
Darn it. Let's give it a try.

408
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,177
Time out.

409
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,145
Oh no!

410
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,038
Interesting.

411
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,457
Blabbermouth! Zombie!

412
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,750
Stop pushing.

413
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:57,504
What's going on here? What are you doing?

414
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,088
Can't you tell?

415
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,089
I'm cleaning up.

416
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,717
General waste
is either buried or incinerated.

417
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,637
What should I do with the three of you?

418
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,180
Come on.

419
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,723
Why you little…

420
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,726
Don't do it!

421
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:14,813
Hey, don't stop me.

422
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:27,116
I've been so busy with work lately
that I haven't dated in forever.

423
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,041
Why am I touching up my lipstick?

424
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,710
What am I expecting?

425
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:38,628
I must be losing it.

426
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,421
Put it back in.

427
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,049
Again?

428
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:47,095
How dare they ruin
my precious dessert time?

429
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,767
No matter how busy I am,
it'd be rude to leave without trying…

430
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,394
the cake.

431
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,230
The party's over.

432
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,189
By yourself?

433
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,149
People eat alone all the time.
Can't I celebrate by myself?

434
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:04,779
-But how could you eat my birthday cake--
-Who says it's yours?

435
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,656
Why would I care about your birthday?

436
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,159
Anyway, leave.

437
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:13,288
I'm too busy sorting trash
to deal with you.

438
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,543
Nice meeting you.

439
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:20,837
I hope the rest of your day sucks.

440
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,589
One more thing.

441
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,925
Be sure to show some manners
if we ever meet again.

442
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,011
I don't want anyone to think you're my ex.

443
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,056
Shouldn't you be more polite
when making a request?

444
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,016
That wasn't a request.

445
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,106
ROOM ESCAPE CAFÉ: LOCK UP
HOW'S YOUR THING DOWN THERE?

446
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:46,946
Right.

447
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,077
EXPERIENCE THE WORST PRISON EVER
A NEW TALE UNFOLDS

448
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:08,885
That's me!

449
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,804
-Move it!
-Watch my head.

450
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,599
My arm!

451
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,017
Seriously!

452
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:25,693
How could Madam Ju
have set me up with such a jerk?

453
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,405
Did you look into
who was behind that article?

454
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,867
As you said,
it was an internal power grab attempt.

455
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:35,954
Who was it?

456
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,580
It was Ms. Noh Su-ahn of Mirae Apparel.

457
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,874
She recently attended a fashion show

458
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,502
and befriended the head of the news outlet
that ran the exclusive.

459
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:46,297
Why can they never leave me alone
when all I want is a peaceful life?

460
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,889
MIRAE GROUP

461
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,434
Mirae Group, one of the top ten
companies in the country,

462
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,395
is undergoing an internal power struggle.

463
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:05,608
The Mirae Kingdom
was established by the Almighty Ju,

464
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:07,443
Chairwoman Ju Cheon-suk.

465
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,447
I call her Madam Ju.

466
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:15,785
A YEAR AGO

467
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,830
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MOTHER

468
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:21,082
CHAIRWOMAN OF MIRAE GROUP
JU CHEON-SUK

469
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,419
I wish you many years
of good health, Mother.

470
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,586
Don't worry.

471
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,921
I'll outlive you.

472
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,256
I hope so.

473
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,091
Noh Suk-min, Madam Ju's eldest child.

474
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:33,511
The poor crown prince,
forever overshadowed by his mother.

475
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,638
Do you still drink like a fish?

476
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,807
I've been sober
for more than ten years, Mother.

477
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:41,936
You look absolutely stunning
today, Mother.

478
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,479
Kim Se-ra, the daughter-in-law.

479
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,898
An elegant peacock
who constantly seeks approval.

480
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,400
Have you had your face done?

481
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:49,318
Of course not.

482
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,904
I just dolled up for the special occasion.

483
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,448
You should consider it.

484
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,787
Noh Do-gyeong, the couple's only son.

485
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,540
He learned to become invisible
in order to survive.

486
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,876
Mom.

487
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,961
Happy birthday, Mom.

488
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,047
Noh Su-ahn, Madam Ju's second child.

489
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:12,175
She is so obsessed with Paris
that she pretends to live there.

490
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:14,177
People call her Parisu-ahnne.

491
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,679
Austin and Justin are her twin sons

492
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,056
-born a minute apart.
-Austin, Justin.

493
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:21,100
THE TWINS
AUSTIN, JUSTIN

494
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,562
What a load of global crap.

495
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:28,191
My husband couldn't make it
because of his research paper schedule.

496
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,526
He feels terrible that he can't be here.

497
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,237
But he already gave me a present.

498
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,199
By not showing up.

499
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,704
Su-ahn's husband is a professor
at an Ivy League school.

500
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:44,624
People call him Unicorn
because he rarely shows up.

501
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,001
Ju Seok-hoon, Madam Ju's nephew.

502
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,711
Happy birthday, Aunt Cheon-suk.

503
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,755
You look neat and tidy as usual.

504
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:54,217
Well, I'm just too busy
increasing your wealth.

505
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,760
Despite being the only other Ju,

506
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:58,721
he is purely a business partner
to Madam Ju.

507
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,682
Are your parents
still in Mongolia or whatever it's called?

508
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,017
They're in Peru.

509
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,978
-You're a year older now, sis.
-Seok-hoon's father

510
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,980
-Happy birthday.
-is the little brother of Cheon-suk.

511
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,066
-You should retire
-He and his wife are frugal hippies.

512
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,901
-and travel around like us.
-Do they ever wash up?

513
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:14,654
-I can't tell them apart from the alpacas.
-Happy birthday.

514
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:19,200
If everyone's here,
are we ready for pictures?

515
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,286
Where's Do-hee?

516
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,081
She must be running late.

517
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:28,167
The whole family's here anyway.
Let's just take the photo.

518
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,210
Yes, Mother.

519
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,461
There isn't much time.

520
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:31,379
Forget it.

521
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,172
I'm not taking any pictures
without Do-hee.

522
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:37,176
I'm sorry! My meeting ran late.

523
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:38,678
You're here.

524
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:41,305
Mother's been waiting for you.

525
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:42,974
As if.

526
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:45,351
I just used her as an excuse
not to take pictures.

527
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,311
Do-hee, stand next to Mother.

528
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,987
Why the long face
on a happy day like this?

529
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,948
It's obvious why
they're celebrating me getting old.

530
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,241
Come on.

531
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,368
At least smile for the picture.

532
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,872
-Here we go. Smile!
-And I'm Do Do-hee.

533
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:09,458
I'm not related to anyone here.

534
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:12,211
I'm like a virus to them.

535
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:15,131
But they don't
show their claws that easily.

536
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,800
Their smile is their weapon.

537
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:25,183
Who will claim the throne of Mirae Group?

538
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,810
The answer to that question
will mean the end of this war

539
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,979
and the beginning of another.

540
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:33,316
LOVE THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU
TRUST LEADS TO HAPPINESS

541
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:48,915
Hello?

542
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,499
Is this Ms. Do Do-hee?

543
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:51,834
Who am I speaking to?

544
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,879
I'm Cha Tae-jun,
the head of Mirae Group's financial team.

545
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:58,591
I'm reaching out to share
an important piece of information.

546
00:36:58,674 --> 00:36:59,967
Which is?

547
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,762
It's not something
to discuss over the phone.

548
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:05,264
All I can tell you right now

549
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:09,477
is that it has the power
to make you chairwoman of Mirae Group.

550
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,146
How did you get my number?

551
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,733
This information is priceless.

552
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:18,945
Please think it over and contact me.

553
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,369
Everyone's dying
to drag me into the dogfight.

554
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,456
Peaceful means alone
aren't enough to maintain peace.

555
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,959
Find out Ms. Noh Su-ahn's schedule.

556
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,839
WORDS OF THE ALMIGHTY JU

557
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,633
This is it for me.

558
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:41,759
See you in heaven.

559
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:56,148
Madam Ju!

560
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:58,025
Are you okay?

561
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,032
Madam Ju…

562
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,246
Please don't leave me.

563
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:14,834
What are you doing?

564
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:25,177
What's with all this drama
over my dozing off?

565
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,182
Where are you going?

566
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:35,062
Do you think this is funny?
Do you know how shocked I was?

567
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,564
Why would you be shocked?

568
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,858
I'm old enough to die.

569
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,194
You know what, Madam Ju?

570
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,071
Liars can't enter heaven.

571
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,615
That's why I've already
bribed God big time.

572
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,577
I never miss an opportunity to donate.

573
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,582
Why are you doing this?

574
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,375
There must be a reason.

575
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,672
Surprise, you little brat!

576
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,761
This isn't just a surprise. It's a shock.

577
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,846
What's gotten into you?

578
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,556
You know I never celebrate my birthday.

579
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,308
That's exactly why I'm doing it.

580
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,102
So…

581
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:18,481
How did it make you feel
to think that I'd be gone?

582
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:20,441
Did all our memories

583
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:24,153
flash before your eyes?

584
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:26,030
That'd be an understatement.

585
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,406
It was like a whole movie.

586
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,993
A horror movie, thanks to you, old witch.

587
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:34,163
If I'm a witch, you're the devil's spawn.

588
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:36,624
How could you be
so rebellious all your life?

589
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,501
You even ran away from home in college.

590
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:41,587
That's because you showed up
in a limo on my first day.

591
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,966
CONGRATS DO-HEE ON BEING ADMITTED
AT THE TOP OF YOUR CLASS

592
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,726
Congratulations, Do-hee!

593
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,853
Congrats!

594
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,190
Here. Do-hee?

595
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:02,858
Take this, Do-hee!

596
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,235
What do I do with this?

597
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:06,821
Do-hee, take this!

598
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,489
Hey!

599
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,366
I didn't want others to look down on you
for being an orphan.

600
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,243
What about paying my boyfriend
to break up with me?

601
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:13,994
I didn't like his vibe.

602
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:19,750
You get what this is, right?

603
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,419
I won't waste my breath.

604
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,843
If you wanted drama,
why didn't you go all the way?

605
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:32,179
You gave him gift vouchers
instead of checks.

606
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,057
Gift vouchers
were more than enough for that brat.

607
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,018
I swear we got close
through our constant squabbling!

608
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,732
That's why I don't have a religion.

609
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,943
You're the only higher power I answer to.

610
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:52,992
How was the blind date?

611
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:54,493
Horrible.

612
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:57,288
Hey, don't make the same mistake I did.

613
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,206
Looks aren't everything.

614
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,667
What are you talking about?
Looks were all he had.

615
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,925
Does he look better in real life?

616
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,051
Like me?

617
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:13,554
Who's that?

618
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:15,139
The guy I was on a date with

619
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,391
is this guy.

620
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:22,688
The matchmaker got the hotel name wrong.

621
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,274
"Jeong Gu-won"?

622
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,068
Who's that?

623
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,992
SUNWOL FOUNDATION

624
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:29,922
Director, don't you think
the lighting is too monotonous?

625
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:32,174
Wipe your drool off
before pretending to be busy.

626
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,181
How's Ga-young doing?

627
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,058
That depends on you.

628
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:43,686
You're her pick-me-up, you know.

629
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:46,981
What did you tell me
in the planning stage of this show?

630
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,774
You said you wouldn't bother me.

631
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:50,150
That you were confident…

632
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,278
I still think
the lighting is too monotonous.

633
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,655
It's a bit off.

634
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:58,993
Hello?

635
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,869
Is this Mr. Jeong Gu-won?

636
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:01,870
What's this about?

637
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,122
I'm Shin Da-jeong,

638
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:06,000
the secretary of Ms. Do Do-hee
of Mirae F&B.

639
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:07,376
And?

640
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,378
What's with the attitude?

641
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:13,382
We apologize
for interrupting your meal today.

642
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:15,801
We'd like to pay for your meal
and offer compensation for--

643
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:16,760
No need.

644
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,433
So he's a jerk to everyone.

645
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:25,102
So it was a match made in hell,
not in heaven?

646
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:26,353
Just a second.

647
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,857
-What are you doing?
-I'll set up another date.

648
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:31,734
Forget it.

649
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:34,403
I won't go on another date
to make you get a checkup.

650
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,196
Give that back!

651
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:39,575
I'm still too young to get married.

652
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,785
You're 28 going on 30.

653
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,662
And you'll turn 40 before you know it.

654
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:47,166
It's my wish
to marry you off before I die.

655
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:48,751
You're not dying anytime soon.

656
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:51,253
If marriage is so great,
why don't you get remarried?

657
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:52,588
Right?

658
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,759
I'll leave you two to squabble. Excuse me.

659
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:05,559
Let me tell you,
having someone on your side

660
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,478
makes a world of difference.

661
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,104
You said not to trust anyone.

662
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,481
No one's on my side.

663
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:11,565
You're right.

664
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,526
You never know
who will stab you in the back.

665
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:18,530
But there will be someone
you'll gladly let stab you in the back.

666
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,866
That's what it means
to have someone on your side.

667
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:24,828
Someone you'd understand
even if they betrayed you.

668
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:27,539
I'm no Mother Teresa.

669
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,791
And neither are you.

670
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:30,834
It's you.

671
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:33,712
You're that person to me.

672
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,804
Now, I've prepared everything.

673
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:44,181
Just find someone
who you'd put this ring on.

674
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:49,144
Don't get ahead of yourself, Madam Ju.

675
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,229
Here.

676
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,523
Wear both rings yourself

677
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:56,026
until you find someone
you'd like to give it to.

678
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,363
Am I looking for Cinderella?

679
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:01,782
A ring is way better than a glass slipper.

680
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,453
It's been over 20 years
since your parents passed.

681
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:10,040
You can stop commemorating
their death anniversary.

682
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:12,376
From now on,

683
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,715
just celebrate your birthday.

684
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,387
Ta-da!

685
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,861
May Madam Ju

686
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:41,864
keep stabbing me in the back
for many years to come.

687
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:43,490
You can count on it.

688
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,040
What?

689
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,418
On that note,

690
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:55,919
your next blind date…

691
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:56,837
Ms. Shin!

692
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,507
I'm busy.

693
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,384
Hey!

694
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:04,136
That little…

695
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,725
My cake… Damn it.

696
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:13,729
Wait, you're leaving already?

697
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:15,689
Yes, I can't seem to focus.

698
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:17,608
I had no cake after fulfilling a deal.

699
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,359
What kept you so busy?

700
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,030
A date.

701
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,115
A date?

702
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,825
My gosh, she can hear us from there?

703
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:28,410
With who?

704
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,329
A girl? Did you sleep with her?

705
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:40,422
I have papers to sign, don't I?

706
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:42,049
A whole lot of them.

707
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,343
Then shall we?

708
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:46,553
-Sure. Let's go.
-Let's go.

709
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:49,681
He slept with her.

710
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:51,725
He definitely did!

711
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,479
Yes, understood.

712
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,314
I have to go.

713
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,566
I have Ms. Noh Su-ahn's schedule.

714
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,861
She's having a staycation
at an affiliate hotel in Sokcho.

715
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:05,405
You can go home.

716
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,615
I'll drive there myself.

717
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:07,824
Sure, as you say.

718
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,328
I thought you'd decline.

719
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:14,331
To me, your word is law.

720
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,542
-Since when?
-Deep down, always.

721
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,001
I have a loyal heart, you see.

722
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,170
I see.

723
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,297
You're quite the closed book, aren't you?

724
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:23,257
I'm an INFP.

725
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,175
Should we get some snacks along the way?

726
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,635
I hope you enjoy them.

727
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:29,012
-Let me give you a ride.
-No, thank you.

728
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,230
Why hasn't she called me back?

729
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:44,278
Do you think you're the only person
I can sell this to, Do Do-hee?

730
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,410
CLEANING IN PROGRESS

731
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:16,518
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR JEONG GU-WON

732
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,688
REQUEST FOR APPROVAL

733
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:22,149
BUSINESS TRIP REPORT

734
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,577
Black coffee for you, sir?

735
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,203
I'm going to head out soon.

736
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:38,040
Will another pitiful soul be doomed today?

737
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:41,043
Another pitiful soul
will be hitting the jackpot.

738
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:44,046
Sure, but it comes with a steep price.

739
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:46,089
That's because it's worth it.

740
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,716
Nothing's free in this world.

741
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,886
So who's the bitch?

742
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,139
Calm down.

743
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:56,892
A celebrity like you
should watch your language.

744
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:58,477
Is she pretty? Younger than me?

745
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:02,397
If I'd known you could be this rude,

746
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:03,649
I would've let you die.

747
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,108
I don't think so.

748
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,903
I'm your only human companion
who understands you.

749
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:08,820
What do you mean?

750
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:10,822
That hurts my feelings.

751
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:12,407
You two are bound by a contract.

752
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:15,744
But what I have with him
is a genuine relationship.

753
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:17,704
I had my contract in my past life.

754
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:18,997
We now have a genuine--

755
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:21,041
-You still get paid.
-So do you.

756
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,210
-You're just a butler.
-And you're just an entertainer.

757
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:24,795
Be quiet, you humans!

758
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:26,421
What's with you?

759
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:29,508
I'm Jin Ga-young,
the Beyoncé of Korean traditional dance.

760
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:30,926
I came here

761
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:33,553
to revive Sunwol Theater
in the middle of my world tour.

762
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:34,721
I'm Star Jin.

763
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:35,847
Exactly.

764
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,892
Even Batman would only be
a loner in a cave without his butler.

765
00:49:38,975 --> 00:49:40,977
-What are you talking about?
-What?

766
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:45,607
To me, you're both equally defective.

767
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:46,733
-What?
-What?

768
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,445
You remember your past life.

769
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:54,324
And you fangirl over a demon.

770
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,868
You two are in no way normal human beings.

771
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,995
Don't let it get to you, Star Jin.

772
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:02,290
He's doing this on purpose
to distance himself from us.

773
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:05,335
He's befriended mortals
only to be left behind too many times.

774
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:09,047
I, for one, understand you.

775
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:13,802
It must be extremely lonely
to be immortal.

776
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:16,888
It's understandable
that you never open up to anyone.

777
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:18,056
So what is it like

778
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,559
to be immortal?

779
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:22,561
Honestly?

780
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:26,898
In a word,

781
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:31,778
it's pretty damn…

782
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,074
amazing.

783
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:41,872
Perfect looks, eloquence,
intelligence, and even a sense of humor…

784
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:44,666
Living as a flawless predator forever?

785
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:45,667
It's just fantastic!

786
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,169
I only have one wish.

787
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:49,296
That this peace would last forever.

788
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,184
Go work on the performance.

789
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:05,896
You insignificant and annoying humans.

790
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,355
You never take my word for it.

791
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:10,233
He used to be human himself.
He hasn't always been a demon.

792
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,653
I bet he was hot even as a human.

793
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,201
Anyway, so who is she?

794
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:21,870
Oh, my tea!

795
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:24,414
She already checked out?

796
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:36,259
I should have known.

797
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,178
Noh Su-ahn and her whims.

798
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:44,851
I haven't been here in a while.

799
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:01,326
Do-hee!

800
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:09,584
Hurry up, Do-hee!

801
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:18,301
I really wanted to stay home today.

802
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,720
Are you already starting to avoid us?

803
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,013
I feel hurt.

804
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,348
Don't you have friends?

805
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:24,683
Hang out with them instead.

806
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,853
No, he doesn't have any friends.

807
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,938
That's why we should hang out with him.

808
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:33,567
But we can't do anything
because it's raining.

809
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,110
Don't worry.

810
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:37,195
It's just a shower.

811
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:38,405
It'll stop soon.

812
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:45,996
Look, it stopped raining!

813
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:50,000
-Should we go back? Let's go!
-Let's go!

814
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:06,725
I'm reminded of you everywhere I go.

815
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,520
How am I supposed to live?

816
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:17,819
Did you have to be
so hard-working and diligent?

817
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:22,449
Did you have to be such perfect parents?

818
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,396
It's strangely quiet today.

819
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:56,858
Something isn't right.

820
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,071
It's finally over.

821
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:45,865
My cursed birthday.

822
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:57,043
Excuse me.
Did you call for a designated driver?

823
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:01,548
-Yes.
-I see.

824
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:20,692
PICKUP SPOT: DONGDAE BEACH

825
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:23,111
17 MINUTES AWAY
YOUR DESIGNATED DRIVER: LEE TAE-SU

826
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:57,687
Who sent you?

827
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:10,325
Wrong question.

828
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:13,036
You should be asking why.

829
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,038
Don't you think so?

830
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:22,253
Don't you want to know why you're dying?

831
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:31,679
Ju Cheon-suk is the reason

832
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,473
you're going to die.

833
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,639
Where could my prey be tonight?

834
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:22,772
Someone so desperate,

835
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,024
lonely,

836
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:27,444
and scared

837
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:31,906
that they wouldn't hesitate
to take my hand.

838
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:54,762
Found you.

839
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:16,826
Please, help…

840
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,174
Jeong Gu-won?

841
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:38,264
What is he doing here?

842
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:48,149
Could it be

843
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:50,443
that he's with him?

844
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,582
No, he's not with him.

845
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,592
My life feels as if it's shrouded in mist.

846
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,804
Who is a friend and who is a foe?

847
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:21,891
Or is everyone around me a foe?

848
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,184
I can't tell.

849
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:26,771
When I can't rely on

850
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:28,731
anything or anyone,

851
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:31,276
all I can do

852
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:35,405
is trust myself.

853
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:48,251
Help me.

854
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:52,630
Are you making a request this time?

855
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:53,965
Yes, please help me.

856
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,384
Fine.

857
00:59:57,343 --> 00:59:59,762
But before that,
you need to make a deal with me.

858
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:03,308
Don't you see that he's holding a knife?

859
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:05,977
Is this really the time to discuss a deal?

860
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:10,273
Nothing's free in this world.

861
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:13,776
All right.

862
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:14,986
What is it about?

863
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:17,822
There's a lot to cover.
Do you really want to go over it now?

864
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:20,158
This isn't exactly tea time, is it?

865
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:23,119
It'd be crazy to enter into a deal
with no information.

866
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:25,580
Suit yourself.

867
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,499
Fine! I'll be crazy.

868
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:34,213
It'd be crazy of me to help you
before signing the contract,

869
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:37,383
but that guy creeps me out.

870
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,142
Hey.

871
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,901
Remember our deal?

872
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:47,008
I have to let go if I want to live.

873
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:05,902
Gu-won.

874
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:09,071
This is all because
of that name, salvation.

875
01:06:00,414 --> 01:06:01,457
It's gone.

876
01:06:07,171 --> 01:06:08,464
We managed to get out alive.

877
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:19,517
I thought I was really going to…

878
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:06,665
What's this tattoo sticker?

879
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:08,292
-"Tattoo sticker"?
-It won't come off.

880
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:11,128
It's on your wrist right now,
but this tattoo is mine.

881
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:12,129
Are you out of your mind?

882
01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:13,589
Do Do-hee the Nutjob.

883
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:16,634
Mirae Group's Chairwoman Ju
took the orphaned Do Do-hee in.

884
01:08:16,717 --> 01:08:19,553
Ju Cheon-suk is the reason
you're going to die.

885
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:21,263
Are you sure you're not hiding anything?

886
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:23,307
I can't go to heaven, can I?

887
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:25,810
I'm extremely lethargic,
and I feel like a different person.

888
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:27,436
I've never felt this way before.

889
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,772
Without your powers,
does this mean you'll burn away?

890
01:08:29,855 --> 01:08:30,689
I'm running out of time.

891
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:32,691
What could you do without your powers?

892
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:34,527
I'm going to do what I'm best at.

893
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:36,445
