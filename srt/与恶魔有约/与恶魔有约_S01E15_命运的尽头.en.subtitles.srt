1
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:57,682
Do-hee.

2
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,769
-We--
-Let's finish decorating

3
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,103
the Christmas tree tonight.

4
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:07,108
I should also book the couple set
that we couldn't have last time.

5
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,402
I hope it's still available.

6
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,326
I don't think…

7
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,499
we can spend Christmas together.

8
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,006
Do-hee.

9
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,427
Save yourself…

10
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,808
from hell.

11
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,671
Gu-won.

12
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,302
Gu-won.

13
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,406
By the time chilly winds
start blowing above ground in October,

14
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,284
heralding the coming of winter,

15
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,039
spring has already begun underground.

16
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:32,128
But that also means that by the time
beautiful cherry blossoms bloom in spring,

17
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,965
winter has already begun underground.

18
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:41,054
Even during our happy moments together,

19
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,014
perhaps our goodbye

20
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,100
had already begun.

21
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:54,067
EPISODE 15
THE END OF FATE

22
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,117
ZERO SUGAR IS THE TREND FOR 2023

23
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,772
ZERO SUGAR IS THE TREND FOR 2023

24
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,194
Yes?

25
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:23,865
I've moved all your plans for this morning
to the afternoon.

26
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:24,782
Thank you.

27
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,951
I'll head to the office
after I talk to the prosecutor.

28
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,619
Will you be okay by yourself?

29
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,164
Shouldn't your attorney accompany you?

30
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,874
I'll be fine. See you in a bit.

31
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,542
Sir.

32
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:38,421
CHIEF PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

33
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,383
Hello.

34
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,436
Ms. Do.

35
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,230
CHIEF PROSECUTOR CHOI WOO-SUN

36
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:00,234
Good to see you again.

37
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:01,903
I'll do my best

38
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:03,654
as my name suggests.

39
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,408
I'm sure you remember me.

40
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,578
I didn't know you were
the prosecutor in charge of my case.

41
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:11,788
I know.

42
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,957
What an interesting turn of events.

43
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:16,959
Please have a seat.

44
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,851
It's already been a week

45
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,647
since the suspect, Noh Suk-min,
jumped into the Han River.

46
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,399
Is his body still missing?

47
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:41,776
Yes.

48
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,946
Will the investigation be closed
when the body is found?

49
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,364
When the suspect dies,

50
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:50,326
the case is usually closed
since there's no one to prosecute anymore.

51
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,328
I heard

52
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:56,290
that you asked for
a transparent investigation.

53
00:06:56,374 --> 00:07:00,169
There are still some questions
regarding Chairwoman Ju's death.

54
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,422
Since Noh Suk-min can no longer confess,

55
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,299
I want the investigation
to uncover the truth.

56
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,051
That's why you need…

57
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,638
a competent prosecutor like me.

58
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,474
My apologies.

59
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:18,396
I'm determined to shed light
on the atrocities committed by Noh Suk-min

60
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,858
and make sure such things
never happen again in this country.

61
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:27,029
I promise to get to the bottom of this,

62
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,824
no matter what.

63
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,161
-Okay.
-On that note,

64
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,663
-let's take a selfie for old times' sake.
-Pardon?

65
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,796
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

66
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,341
All right. Don't get a cold.

67
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:52,430
If it's not too much to ask,
allow me to post this on social media.

68
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,058
It is too much to ask.

69
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:01,189
Chairman Noh's body has yet to be found.

70
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:04,734
According to the police,
the search is proving to be difficult

71
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,612
as he fell into the Han River
from the rooftop of a building.

72
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,840
-Mommy.
-Mommy.

73
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:32,929
Austin.

74
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,057
Justin.

75
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,194
-Mr. Han.
-Yes?

76
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,278
Ms. Choi.

77
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,863
I hear the body's still missing.

78
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,031
Hey!

79
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,992
It's already been a week.

80
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,661
I bet he's been eaten up by fish.

81
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:02,833
Chaebols must be wired differently
from ordinary people like us.

82
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,627
How could he do that to his family?

83
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,797
Chaebols sold their souls
to the devil, you see.

84
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,173
That's right.

85
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,758
It's the least one can do

86
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,553
to become a chaebol.

87
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,804
Ms. Do is a chaebol too.

88
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,764
She's different.

89
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:17,974
She's self-made.

90
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,017
-She wasn't born a chaebol.
-Exactly.

91
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,436
So she's different.

92
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,148
Anyway, seeing Mr. Jeong
used to be our biggest workplace benefit,

93
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,526
but I haven't seen him in a while.

94
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:29,527
Did he fight with Ms. Do?

95
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,738
-No way.
-You think so?

96
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,366
Anyway, it does feel

97
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:38,286
a bit empty in the office without him.

98
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,203
I agree.

99
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,998
He doesn't do much,
but he has such a strong presence.

100
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,757
The theater feels so empty,

101
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,468
although Director Jeong
was away all the time

102
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:58,264
and never spent much time here.

103
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,476
From now on,

104
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,228
you're the executive director
of Sunwol Foundation.

105
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,732
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR PARK BOK-GYU

106
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,236
What's this about?
Are you in danger again?

107
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,321
I'm just…

108
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,032
going away for a bit.

109
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,743
I'll leave the foundation to you
until I get back.

110
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,745
How long will you be away?

111
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,415
Until Do-hee…

112
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,419
gets her happy ending without me.

113
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,304
Director Jeong.

114
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,060
When are you leaving?

115
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,605
As soon as I'm done here.

116
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,901
I hope you'll find peace

117
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,570
wherever you end up.

118
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,283
I asked myself this question.

119
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,745
"If I had known when to stop,

120
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,247
would I have been able
to be happy around you?"

121
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,957
And the answer…

122
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,169
was no.

123
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,880
I would've ended up like this anyway.

124
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,218
I'm not friendly enough
to be a human companion.

125
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,762
I would've eventually ended up biting you.

126
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,814
Do you know the story

127
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,440
"The Scorpion and the Frog"?

128
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:36,362
A scorpion wants to
get to the other side of the river,

129
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,156
so it asks a frog to carry it across.

130
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:43,411
But the frog is afraid
that the scorpion might sting it.

131
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:48,040
So the scorpion says,
"Why would I? I'd drown if I killed you."

132
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:52,336
The frog is convinced
and starts carrying the scorpion across.

133
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,049
But the scorpion gets scared
by the rough current

134
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,177
and ends up stinging the frog.

135
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,264
The frog asks, "Why did you do that?"

136
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,182
"Both of us are going to die now."

137
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,812
The scorpion answers
with a sad look in its eyes,

138
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,274
"I couldn't help it."

139
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:15,943
"It's just…

140
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,529
my nature."

141
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,578
It was a matter of time
before I ended up like this

142
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,496
because this is my nature.

143
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,417
This is who I am.

144
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:41,886
Yes.

145
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,013
You're right.

146
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,682
We would've…

147
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,062
ended up like this anyway.

148
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,169
Was his love poisonous as well?

149
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:29,225
If Do Do-hee put this on,

150
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,560
could she remember her past life
like I did?

151
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,398
That might change the course of events.

152
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,650
No.

153
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,653
Director Jeong always warned me
about my big mouth.

154
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:41,862
I should stay out of it.

155
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:45,991
Boss!

156
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:54,917
Boss!

157
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,191
Hello there.

158
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,776
I was just looking for something.

159
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,653
I'm here to see the boss.

160
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,572
May I ask what this is about?

161
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,157
I have something important to give him.

162
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,910
Something important?

163
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,750
We opened a restaurant.

164
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,711
BLOODY DELICIOUS!
SUNNY SPOT RICE SOUP

165
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,713
"Sunny Spot Rice Soup"?

166
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:41,755
Yes.

167
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:48,846
We finally get to stand tall
before the boss.

168
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,641
-I see.
-So where is he now?

169
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,351
Well…

170
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:00,858
Boss…

171
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:11,702
Ms. Do.

172
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,370
It's time for lunch.

173
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,581
I'm not hungry. You can go ahead.

174
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,068
You're early.

175
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,569
There's still some time left.

176
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,696
I knew you'd be skipping lunch,

177
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,907
so I came early to eat with you.

178
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,534
I'm not hungry.

179
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,370
Well, I'm famished.

180
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,996
Eat with me, will you?

181
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:58,916
All right.

182
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,752
What are you so busy with
that you're even skipping lunch?

183
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,713
I was reviewing the rebuttal
made by the compensation committee.

184
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,926
I have to be thorough,
or the board will find fault with it.

185
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,721
It's a piece of cake
to come up with false accusations,

186
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,432
but proving the truth is an uphill battle.

187
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,433
Oh, I almost forgot.

188
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,352
I heard your company
is going to sign an MOU.

189
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,437
We're signing this week.

190
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,856
You're finally expanding
into the American market.

191
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,193
I bet Su-ahn's
going to be green with envy.

192
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,952
About Mr. Jeong,

193
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:36,996
is he really gone?

194
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,210
It's just that our contract expired.

195
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,547
We had agreed to be together
just until I caught the culprit,

196
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:50,009
and he got his tattoo back.

197
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,638
Everything's back to normal, that's all.

198
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,519
Hopefully, this will boost your energy.

199
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:01,603
It's duck.

200
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,567
I think Ms. Do needs
more energy than I do.

201
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,652
I guess it'll take time.

202
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,863
Romance may be fleeting,

203
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,281
but the heartache lingers.

204
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,493
Please take good care of her.

205
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,163
I will.

206
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,248
And I'll

207
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,459
take good care of you.

208
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:31,842
We should all take the stairs after lunch.

209
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,762
Every step you climb is supposed to
add four seconds to your life.

210
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,096
What?

211
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,642
Does that mean every stair you descend
takes away four seconds?

212
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,810
What?

213
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,645
Does it?

214
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,315
Whatever. Let's keep going.

215
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,861
What are you doing?

216
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,863
Something smells good.

217
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,032
The exercise is already paying off.

218
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,450
It's making you hungry.

219
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,619
-I'm hungry.
-See?

220
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,579
I'm hungry too.

221
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,043
Ms. Shin.

222
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,630
Are you eating out here alone in secret?

223
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,092
That's a lot of food.

224
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,219
Oh, my.

225
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,931
Thanks to the thorough rebuttal
that you prepared,

226
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,308
the committee is most likely to remain.

227
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,894
And I have you two to thank for that.

228
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,562
I didn't do much.

229
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,857
It was all thanks to Ms. Do.

230
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,111
-Thank you so much.
-Don't mention it.

231
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:36,657
You know what the committee
means to Mirae Group.

232
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:41,286
Both my father and Chairwoman Ju
would have wanted it to remain.

233
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,749
Madam Ju probably didn't foresee

234
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,795
that giving up on the investment
and acknowledging the industrial accident

235
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,713
would lead to an even bigger investment.

236
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,215
Probably not.

237
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,759
People back then
had little understanding of concepts

238
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,220
like business reputation
and crisis management.

239
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,265
Suk-min seems to have incorrectly assumed

240
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:04,726
that Aunt Cheon-suk
had orchestrated the whole thing.

241
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,063
Was I really her way out,

242
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,859
like Noh Suk-min said?

243
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:17,573
She may have taken me in
due to guilt and remorse,

244
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,533
just like why she established

245
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,536
the Industrial Accident
Compensation Committee.

246
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,541
Do-hee.

247
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:30,335
There's something
Aunt Cheon-suk said to me

248
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,882
when the sugar juice scandal
broke out against your company.

249
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:40,971
Here's the analysis of Mirae F&B's
financial statements, as you requested.

250
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,932
I waited for Do-hee to leave
to give it to you.

251
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,437
I wonder where she gets
her stubbornness from.

252
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,689
I dislike it very much.

253
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,525
You love her way too much.

254
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,953
I never planned on loving her.

255
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,875
It was more of an unexpected accident.

256
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,837
The more I love her,

257
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:16,965
the more I suffer.

258
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:25,891
I didn't understand
what she meant back then.

259
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,267
But now I do.

260
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,771
The more she loved me,

261
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,149
the more she suffered.

262
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,779
Still, she continued to love me.

263
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,839
GRAND OPENING
SUNNY SPOT RICE SOUP

264
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,719
Welcome, boss… I mean, sir!

265
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,597
-Welcome, boss… I mean, sir!
-Welcome, boss… I mean, sir!

266
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,933
I'll come back next time. Bye.

267
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,811
Wait, sir!

268
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,523
Please don't go.

269
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,822
Don't worry.

270
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,031
The boss, I mean…

271
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,867
Customers will come.

272
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,334
It's been a week since
Chairman Noh Suk-min jumped to his death,

273
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:37,296
and his body is still missing.

274
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:41,341
Despite the ongoing search
and investigation,

275
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:46,221
the police and the fire department
have yet to find any clues.

276
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,556
Could it be…

277
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:51,476
Meanwhile, the police are continuing
to investigate Chairman Noh

278
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,437
for possible additional charges.

279
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,125
It's okay.

280
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,336
I was alone from the beginning.

281
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,385
Everything's just back
the way it used to be.

282
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,458
It's warm.

283
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,173
Gu-won?

284
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,375
Congratulations.

285
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,128
This looks delicious.

286
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,337
Dig in.

287
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,257
This restaurant
is supposed to be really good.

288
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,217
Then be quiet and eat as much as you can.

289
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,468
-I should.
-Dig in.

290
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:36,886
Thank you.

291
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:38,930
It's really good.

292
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:41,766
-Let me pour you some.
-Please.

293
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,937
-Let's have a toast, Ms. Do.
-Sure.

294
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:49,274
Here's to our happiness,
optimism, positivity, and enthusiasm.

295
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:50,567
To HOPE!

296
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:54,988
To HOPE!

297
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,615
-To HOPE!
-To HOPE!

298
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:58,616
HOPE…

299
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:07,000
Now that we're expanding into the US,
can we go on business trips to New York?

300
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,961
I'm going to study English really hard.

301
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:13,465
I've already signed up
for morning phone call English lessons.

302
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:14,799
Why didn't you tell me?

303
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,384
-To HOPE.
-To HOPE.

304
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,931
Let's go for another round!

305
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,641
The sun isn't up yet.

306
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,770
Let's just go home, Ms. Choi.

307
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,438
Another round at her place?

308
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:29,773
-What?
-Sounds good!

309
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:32,359
-Did you call for a designated driver?
-I did.

310
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,361
Will you be okay by yourself?

311
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,988
Of course. Why wouldn't I be okay?

312
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,448
I'll be absolutely fine.

313
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:39,824
I'm off.

314
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,242
See you. Thank you for today!

315
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,327
Go for another round!

316
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,829
-Get home safely, ma'am!
-Bye!

317
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,331
Please get her home safe.

318
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,490
Hey, get your act together.

319
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,369
Do you want me to have
the maintenance office replace you?

320
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,175
I'm bleeding.

321
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,766
Do you think this can hurt me?

322
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,061
No way.

323
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:51,855
I'm fine.

324
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,027
Careful.

325
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:00,613
Careful.

326
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,541
That's what I'm talking about.

327
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:16,629
It's so nice to see you
beaming so brightly.

328
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,383
Get your act together.

329
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,145
I'll leave the rest to you,

330
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:34,647
my alter ego.

331
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:38,610
Please take care of me tonight as well.

332
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:13,371
My alter ego did a great job again.

333
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:17,417
Could my alter ego be better than me?

334
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,684
I'm bleeding.

335
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,564
I could've sworn I hurt myself last night.

336
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,403
Ms. Shin.

337
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:46,779
Yes?

338
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,993
I feel like Gu-won
is still hovering around me.

339
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,290
Many people feel that way after a breakup.

340
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,667
You're probably right.

341
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,795
I guess it hasn't sunk in yet.

342
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:05,006
Maybe I should become a nun.

343
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,132
You can't.

344
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,053
It's not you I'm concerned about,

345
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,387
but the convent.

346
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,104
Come in.

347
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,279
You should go home.

348
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,782
Are you going to work late again?

349
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:32,909
Yes. Thank you for today.

350
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:47,674
Ms. Do.

351
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:53,721
I also took refuge in work
right after my divorce.

352
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:58,267
I buried myself with work for days on end
as if I'd been possessed.

353
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:03,272
Back then, I believed I had to be okay.

354
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,985
And I thought I could become okay
by pretending.

355
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,112
But it turned out

356
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,155
that time couldn't heal everything

357
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,866
if I kept running away.

358
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:18,037
For time to heal my wounds,

359
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:22,667
I needed to stay true to my emotions
and ride out the pain and grief.

360
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,294
I don't think

361
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,839
people have to be okay all the time.

362
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,092
Nor can they be.

363
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,167
SEOK-HOON

364
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:08,880
Hi, Seok-hoon.

365
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,633
Are you skipping dinner
and working late again?

366
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,719
No, I'm not.

367
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,888
I already had dinner
and am now lying in bed.

368
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,685
I see.

369
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,063
What's the matter?

370
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,066
Nothing.

371
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,233
You're silly.

372
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,196
All right.

373
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,822
Get some rest.

374
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:35,948
Okay.

375
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:06,771
Ms. Shin!

376
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,947
Don't worry. Everyone's left.

377
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,533
I've been watching the whole time.

378
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,703
How long have you been waiting?

379
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:23,913
It's cold.

380
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:25,289
I'm not cold at all.

381
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,929
Why do you have that look on your face?

382
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:42,807
What look?

383
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,686
You look like you're so happy
that you're sad.

384
00:35:58,865 --> 00:35:59,699
Let's go.

385
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:53,836
This is our song now.

386
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,332
"Safety precautions."

387
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:20,673
So it really is a manual.

388
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:55,124
I was just covering our faces
so he wouldn't recognize us.

389
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,169
I'll help you. We still have time.

390
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,880
This one symbolizes eternal happiness.

391
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,007
This one means
happiness that is meant to be.

392
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,800
And this one…

393
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,054
I love you, Jeong Gu-won.

394
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:12,850
I love you too.

395
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:15,936
Never say

396
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,856
you're going somewhere
far away alone again.

397
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,816
I'll grant your wish.

398
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,569
I'll never leave you

399
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,696
no matter what happens.

400
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,157
Gu-won.

401
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,325
Yes?

402
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,035
I just

403
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:33,329
wanted to know if you were there.

404
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,164
Keep calling my name.

405
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:39,043
I'll answer every time.

406
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,052
Gu-won.

407
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,347
Gu-won.

408
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,720
What brings you here at this hour?

409
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:37,977
I missed Gu-won so much,

410
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,814
and this was the only place
I could think of.

411
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,780
If only I could catch a glimpse of him.

412
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,993
If only I could run into him,
even just for a moment.

413
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,873
But I don't know where to go.

414
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,170
I know nothing about him.

415
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,631
Even when he left,

416
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,758
I didn't get to say anything to him.

417
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,305
I didn't get to say thank you

418
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:17,683
or that I was sorry.

419
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:26,066
I'm the one who let him go.

420
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,114
The more I loved him, the more I suffered.

421
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:36,744
That's why

422
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,997
I let him go.

423
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:12,696
I think you need this.

424
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:27,378
It'll help whenever you miss him too much.

425
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:14,675
Young Master.

426
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:39,783
You must be

427
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,994
the famous Wolsim.

428
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:48,042
What did she do to get on the wrong side
of someone so powerful?

429
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,084
No idea.

430
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,669
She must be a real piece of work.

431
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:03,932
You tramp!

432
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,771
So what if you used to be
a government courtesan?

433
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:13,442
How dare you try to lecture me
when you should be obeying me?

434
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,779
That dirty little tramp

435
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:18,906
is looking down on me.

436
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,327
You're a lowly courtesan.

437
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,162
Do you even know who I am?

438
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,624
-Please calm down.
-Don't be like that.

439
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,251
-Calm down.
-Let go!

440
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,670
Come on.

441
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:36,799
Calm down.

442
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,219
She must think
she still works for officials,

443
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:41,720
acting all stuck-up like that.

444
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:45,724
She might hear you.

445
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,645
She's been here for days,
but she hasn't said a word to us.

446
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:53,315
A government courtesan
obviously doesn't speak our language.

447
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,944
To think
such a famous government courtesan

448
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,363
ended up penniless in this small village.

449
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:00,364
How does she bear it?

450
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:01,657
I'd kill myself if I were her.

451
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,162
I'm planning on doing just that.

452
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,957
But it'd be lonely to die alone.

453
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,000
Will you die with me?

454
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:20,008
Regardless of our rank,
we're all courtesans, after all.

455
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,720
No one in this room

456
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,180
gets to breathe freely.

457
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,195
In my next life,

458
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:43,824
I hope I will not be destroyed
by disdain and mockery.

459
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:48,871
I hope I can be myself.

460
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:43,759
Young Master Yi-sun!

461
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:47,513
Wait!

462
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:02,236
I heard a friend of yours died in Hanyang.

463
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,989
There's no courtesan here
without a story to tell.

464
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:07,991
Get ready and come out.

465
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,834
Have a drink, my lord.

466
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,754
All right, let's drink.

467
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,258
Have a drink, my lord.

468
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:27,469
Let's talk in private
in the room over there.

469
00:47:28,845 --> 00:47:30,764
Please have a drink, my lord.

470
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,516
Wolsim at your service.

471
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,184
Have a drink.

472
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,070
This is unacceptable!

473
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:47,614
She is said to have been haughty
in Hanyang as well.

474
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,908
What an insolent woman.

475
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,704
-Have a drink and let it go, my lord.
-Pour me one.

476
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:02,588
Life is pathetic,

477
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,673
and humans are contemptible.

478
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:10,804
What is the point of enduring another day?

479
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:27,237
My apologies.

480
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:30,616
I came over the other day
because I wanted to see you.

481
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:32,909
I apologize if I was being rude.

482
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,371
How exactly were you being rude?

483
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,543
I can't quite pinpoint it, but…

484
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,545
Please don't apologize
if you don't know why.

485
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,006
Wait…

486
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:51,595
I can't even kill myself when I want to.

487
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:57,893
Why does that silly man
keep getting in my way?

488
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:25,087
What are you doing?

489
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,172
My lady!

490
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:28,507
What a coincidence!

491
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,387
Is it?

492
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:50,612
COMMENTARIES ON GREAT LEARNING

493
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,646
Wolsim!

494
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:52,651
-Young Master.
-Wolsim.

495
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:00,617
Something to remember me by
while I'm away.

496
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:23,056
I'll never take it off

497
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:25,225
until you come back.

498
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:28,270
The last thing I see before I die

499
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,982
will be your face.

500
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,294
They don't treat us as humans.

501
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:56,089
It's not like they earned their nobility.
It was simply given at birth.

502
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:57,007
Just let it go.

503
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:00,218
Why should we remain silent
when we're treated like vermin?

504
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,928
How different can we be from them?

505
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:27,704
The world will change.

506
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:29,539
Once it does,

507
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:34,419
no one will face disdain or mockery
because of their class.

508
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:42,260
You seem to be in a good mood today.

509
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:45,138
I had a good dream last night.

510
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,308
I think I'll hear the good news
I've been waiting for.

511
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:27,722
I have no regrets.

512
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,725
I was planning on ending my life anyway.

513
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:34,938
Even so,

514
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:36,940
if only I could…

515
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:40,276
I love you, Wolsim.

516
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:43,530
If only I could see Young Master Yi-sun

517
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:47,450
for one last time.

518
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:00,213
Wolsim!

519
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:09,472
Young Master…

520
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:14,686
May he forget me…

521
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:18,815
so that his memories of me

522
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:24,112
will not bring him pain and sorrow.

523
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:46,551
I was…

524
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,680
Wolsim.

525
00:55:57,687 --> 00:56:00,356
Yi-sun saved me
when I was going to kill myself.

526
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:18,625
Could he be there?

527
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:36,476
CONTRACT EXPIRATION

528
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,339
How…

529
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,388
I'm glad you recognize me.

530
00:57:57,765 --> 00:58:00,393
I would've felt hurt if you didn't.

531
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,566
What do you think about my new face?

532
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:09,777
Do you like it?

533
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:13,156
You have nowhere to flee to.

534
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,200
You're wrong.

535
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:16,618
I can still flee to hell.

536
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,244
No!

537
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:35,887
I erased my face with my own two hands

538
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:38,806
so the damn devil
wouldn't be able to find me.

539
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:40,975
What do you want?

540
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:42,477
What do I want?

541
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:54,697
I want to destroy the two of you for good.

542
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,951
I've lost everything because of you two.

543
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,911
Money, reputation, family,

544
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:01,287
and even my face.

545
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:06,918
Killing you alone won't be enough now.

546
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:18,930
Get the damn devil here.

547
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:22,141
He shows up when you're in danger, right?

548
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:23,560
He won't.

549
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:27,188
He's left me.

550
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:31,109
Do you expect me to believe that?

551
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:41,035
Come out, Jeong Gu-won!

552
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:44,122
Come out if you want to save Do Do-hee!

553
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:52,130
You won't come out?

554
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:56,301
Get him here right now.

555
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:00,805
Scream, beg him to save you,
or do whatever to get him here!

556
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,690
You don't want to?

557
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:12,317
Then I have no choice

558
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:15,653
but to slit your throat first.

559
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:40,261
Gu-won.

560
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:44,140
Yes, that's what I'm talking about.

561
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,267
I knew you'd show up.

562
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:51,272
I'll kill you first.

563
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:19,801
No, Gu-won!

564
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:21,177
You'll burn away if you kill him!

565
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:22,762
Don't!

566
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,358
Stop it, Gu-won!

567
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:37,944
Gu-won!

568
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:39,529
No!

569
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:43,032
Yes.

570
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,618
Get my blood on your hands.

571
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:47,787
Gu-won!

572
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:53,418
Stop!

573
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:59,006
Stop it, Gu-won!

574
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:00,883
That's enough.

575
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,136
I'm okay now.

576
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:05,722
I'm okay now, so please stop.

577
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:07,056
Please.

578
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:24,574
Gu-won.

579
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,451
Everything's okay now.

580
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:47,722
I missed you, Do-hee.

581
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:51,225
I missed you too.

582
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,103
I missed you so much.

583
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:05,156
Do-hee.

584
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:07,033
Are you okay?

585
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:20,588
No!

586
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:34,811
Do-hee.

587
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:51,744
Do-hee.

588
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:53,704
Do-hee!

589
01:03:54,288 --> 01:03:55,122
No!

590
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:59,961
Please don't die, Do-hee.

591
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:41,586
"I can do all things…

592
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:48,843
through him…

593
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:53,890
who gives me strength."

594
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:43,522
Gu-won.

595
01:05:46,984 --> 01:05:47,985
Do-hee.

596
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:51,238
Everything's okay now.

597
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:06,545
Gu-won.

598
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:09,423
Did you…

599
01:06:11,592 --> 01:06:12,843
save me?

600
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:20,726
I saved myself.

601
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:26,023
No.

602
01:06:28,025 --> 01:06:29,026
Why?

603
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:43,124
Gu-won.

604
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:46,252
Don't go.

605
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:48,879
Please don't leave me.

606
01:06:49,463 --> 01:06:51,173
Don't go.

607
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:04,562
Please don't go, Gu-won.

608
01:07:45,102 --> 01:07:46,312
Gu-won.

609
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:48,314
Gu-won!

610
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:54,445
Gu-won!

611
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,949
Please don't go!

612
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:49,143
So that's the choice you made.

613
01:09:49,226 --> 01:09:51,770
I can't feel him anywhere.

614
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:54,732
She had barely been holding on,
but she's fallen apart in the end.

615
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,649
What?

616
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:57,818
Will that brat Do-hee
really become the chairwoman?

617
01:09:57,902 --> 01:09:58,819
The chairperson is coming.

618
01:09:58,903 --> 01:09:59,904
You sure have a heart of stone.

619
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:03,115
Everyone around you died off,
but you don't bat an eye.

620
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,451
Merry Christmas, Gu-won.

621
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:06,744
Make a deal with me.

622
01:10:06,827 --> 01:10:07,828
My wish…

623
01:10:12,499 --> 01:10:17,504
