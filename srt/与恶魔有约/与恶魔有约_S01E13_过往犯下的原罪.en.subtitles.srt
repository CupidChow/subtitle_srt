1
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,921
Defend us in battle.

2
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,799
Be our protection against

3
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,260
the wickedness and snares of Satan.

4
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:56,222
Cast into hell

5
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,057
Satan and all the evil spirits.

6
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,979
Trust in the mercy of the Lord

7
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,816
and confess your sins honestly. Amen.

8
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,153
Amen.

9
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:15,742
I…

10
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,955
saw the devil.

11
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,920
Blinded by greed,

12
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,506
I stopped at nothing

13
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,675
as if I were possessed by the devil.

14
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,224
And someone tried to stop me.

15
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,061
He said

16
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,355
he would reveal…

17
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,151
my wrongdoings to the world.

18
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:53,613
I assumed

19
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:58,326
he was trying to bring me down

20
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:02,080
out of envy…

21
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:12,590
EPISODE 13
THE PAST, THE ORIGINAL SIN

22
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,719
I really enjoyed the performance.

23
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:23,852
I finally understand
why you're so obsessed with tradition.

24
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,151
About the human version of you…

25
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:34,821
Seo Yi-sun.

26
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,824
That was my name.

27
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:42,954
Seo Yi-sun.

28
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,333
I like it.

29
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:51,337
What happened to him in the end?

30
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,178
He took his own life.

31
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,347
He did it

32
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,058
so that he wouldn't go to heaven.

33
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,897
He didn't want to go anyway.

34
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,565
Nor did he deserve to.

35
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,127
I feel sorry for him.

36
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,096
By the way, you lied through your teeth.

37
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,183
You said it was
neither a happy nor a sad ending

38
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,352
but an ordinary and insignificant ending.

39
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,063
This time,

40
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:53,024
I'll make it a happy ending.

41
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,253
A firefly?

42
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:14,796
Yes.

43
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,673
Our reunion

44
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,467
after all this time

45
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,095
might be

46
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,181
my second chance.

47
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:10,893
This time,

48
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,689
I'll never make you miserable.

49
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,426
Why are you out here today?

50
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:48,097
I need some peace and quiet
once in a while.

51
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,808
Does watching humans give you peace?

52
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,186
It can both hurt you

53
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,021
and give you peace.

54
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,106
There are two sides to every coin.

55
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,902
I don't want to repeat
my unfortunate past with Do-hee.

56
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,029
What am I to do?

57
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,532
Are you asking me for help?

58
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,951
No, you're not going to help me anyway.

59
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:11,746
I'm just…

60
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,041
asking your opinion.

61
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,377
It wouldn't be called a misfortune

62
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,879
if it were preventable.

63
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,883
You really are no help.

64
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,468
I thought you didn't need my help.

65
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,848
Happiness has no meaning
without misfortune.

66
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,976
Humans wouldn't appreciate happiness
if they had it all the time.

67
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,896
You talk as if
misfortune has some great value.

68
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,315
But it's utterly useless.

69
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,527
Human lives are too short,

70
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,362
even just for happiness.

71
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,872
Happiness

72
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,250
can sometimes be poisonous.

73
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,810
Wake up, Do-hee.

74
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:19,981
Five more minutes.

75
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,942
Let's have some homemade food
like you wanted.

76
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,654
Homemade food?

77
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,916
So where's the homemade food?

78
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,793
Close your eyes for a second.

79
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,337
Just for a second.

80
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,478
What is this?

81
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,398
You remembered
that I wanted homemade food.

82
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,524
Of course.

83
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,109
I never forget anything you say.

84
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,361
Hubby.

85
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:11,657
It looks so good.

86
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,534
-Shall we?
-Sure.

87
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,995
But before that, drink some water.

88
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,914
Hold on. I'll go brush my teeth.

89
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,166
I'll be right back.
Don't start without me.

90
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,459
Wait for me!

91
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,044
But go ahead and drink the water!

92
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,971
It's already December.

93
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,515
Time flies.

94
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,977
From the blind date to the wedding…

95
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,230
It all seems like a lifetime ago.

96
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,398
I know.

97
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,192
It's been an eventful year.

98
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,070
Come to think of it,

99
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,490
this will be our first Christmas together.

100
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,495
Then again, you dislike Christmas.

101
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:58,412
That's not true.

102
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,539
I like it now.

103
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,791
I like anything you like.

104
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,085
I'm so looking forward
to our first Christmas.

105
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,380
This calls for some Christmas music.

106
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,602
Why is the traffic so slow?

107
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,771
There must've been an accident.

108
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,259
Do-hee.

109
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,595
Yeah?

110
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,265
What were we talking about?

111
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,019
Christmas.

112
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:04,770
Right.

113
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,522
Christmas.

114
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,359
Let's listen to something else.

115
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,591
Thank you.

116
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,436
Drink up.

117
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,063
It's perfect for this time of day.

118
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,156
That wakes me right up.

119
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,242
So this is new.

120
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,995
I'm surprised you wanted to see me.

121
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,624
It's because you know Do-hee
better than anyone else.

122
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,626
Is something up with her?

123
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,962
We saw a car accident on our way to work.

124
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:13,756
I think

125
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,884
that reminded her
of her parents' accident.

126
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,431
I want to make her happy at all times,

127
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,100
but she always seems…

128
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,895
to feel guilty about being happy.

129
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,814
It could be guilt

130
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,649
or anxiety.

131
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,317
She once said

132
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,529
that the few years
she spent with her parents

133
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,073
before they passed away

134
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:43,327
had been the happiest time of her life.

135
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,917
Her life turned miserable
at the peak of happiness.

136
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:54,964
It could be that happiness scares her.

137
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:58,926
Did she move in with Ju Cheon-suk
right after the accident?

138
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:02,555
No, she lived with one relative
after another for a while.

139
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,975
Her relatives would take her in
for her inheritance and insurance money,

140
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:11,439
only to abandon her
when the money ran dry.

141
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,276
When I first met her,

142
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:18,279
she was like a porcupine.

143
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:24,410
She was extremely wary of everyone,
thinking she might be left alone again.

144
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,788
Aunt Cheon-suk was the one
who opened Do-hee's heart,

145
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,459
but Do-hee lost her as well.

146
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:36,964
Catching her killer
kept Do-hee preoccupied for a while.

147
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,176
But the old wound…

148
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,387
must be acting up again now.

149
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,551
Come in.

150
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,386
It's time for the meeting.

151
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,013
Okay.

152
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,767
We're planning a promotional event

153
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,394
to maximize awareness

154
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,272
of Mirae F&B's new product

155
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,400
and actively attract customers.

156
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,444
-Ms. Choi?
-Yes.

157
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,321
As for the location,

158
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:46,075
we're considering gyms,
marathons, university festivals, and such.

159
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,117
Any other options?

160
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,953
These are all so obvious.

161
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,913
I want somewhere new and trendy.

162
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,665
How about

163
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:53,999
Sunwol Theater?

164
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,044
The place run by Director Jeong?

165
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,255
Have you heard of the term
"trendy traditions"?

166
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,507
Traditional culture is all the rage now.

167
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,843
Ms. Jin's performance
is the talk of the town as well.

168
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,221
I don't think that's a good idea.

169
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,347
Who's Ms. Jin?

170
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,182
She's the one who showed up here

171
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,268
after Mr. Jeong's near-fatal attack.

172
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,853
She even hugged him in front of everyone.

173
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,272
You made a fuss,

174
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,649
saying it was more fun
than Love and War, remember?

175
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,859
What are you talking about?
I never said that.

176
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,528
I'm sorry.

177
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:23,988
I like the idea.

178
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,283
Let's collaborate with Sunwol Theater.

179
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,662
-Ms. Do.
-Yes?

180
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,083
Ms. Shin will coordinate things.

181
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:37,960
Okay.

182
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,379
-Ms. Do.
-Yes?

183
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:51,098
Her life turned miserable
at the peak of happiness.

184
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:55,311
It could be that happiness scares her.

185
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,944
-Gu-won!
-Hey.

186
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,656
Is it okay if I hold a promotional event

187
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,367
for my company's new product
at Sunwol Theater?

188
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,953
Whatever you want, Do-hee.

189
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:14,455
Don't say that.

190
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,540
I'm making an official offer,

191
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,585
so please officially consider it
as the Executive Director.

192
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,087
Then I give my official approval.

193
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,298
Great.

194
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,468
Now, my company's marketing team

195
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,303
is going to send over a proposal.

196
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,347
Here it is.

197
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,848
-Take a look.
-Okay.

198
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,392
Let me give you a brief explanation first.

199
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,687
We'll check on the performance schedule
and decide on the date…

200
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,105
I'm concerned.

201
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,858
When things get tough,

202
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,194
Do-hee tends to push herself.

203
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,156
It's her way of suppressing her emotions.

204
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,702
Please stay by her side and make sure

205
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,747
she doesn't push herself too hard.

206
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,345
MIRAE GROUP CORP.

207
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,471
MIRAE FOUNDATION

208
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,556
"Industrial Accident
Compensation Committee"?

209
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,769
It was established by Chairwoman Ju
and was unprecedented in Korea back then.

210
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:22,773
It greatly improved the company's image
after the industrial accident

211
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,858
and thus holds great symbolic value.

212
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,694
It's out of date now.

213
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:28,696
Disband it.

214
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,865
The stockholders who believe in
Chairwoman Ju's management philosophy

215
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,409
will oppose it strongly.

216
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,160
My mother is dead.

217
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,541
So is the world she created.

218
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,546
Have at least 30% of our full-time workers
to be switched to part-time.

219
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:48,549
I want each affiliate
to submit their restructuring plans.

220
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,139
You didn't

221
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,307
live the way your father wanted.

222
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,184
That's why you're being punished.

223
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,106
Calm down!

224
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,862
It's your turn now.

225
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,693
Mom?

226
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,320
Dad?

227
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,281
Where are you?

228
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,992
Where did you go?

229
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,334
Where did you go without me?

230
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,107
Dad?

231
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,578
Gu-won?

232
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,794
They all left without me.

233
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,338
They left me here alone.

234
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,274
It's my fault.

235
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,528
I'm responsible.

236
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,620
Do-hee.

237
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,539
You didn't do anything wrong.

238
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,166
Then…

239
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,418
why has everyone left?

240
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,130
Why have they left me here alone?

241
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,257
They didn't leave you.

242
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,301
It's just…

243
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,846
that you can't see them for a while.

244
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,681
Does that mean

245
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,350
I can see them again?

246
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,394
Of course.

247
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,900
Should we go see them now?

248
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:37,945
Let's go.

249
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,922
Why is that one so big?

250
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,299
Because it's going on top.

251
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,634
Is it?

252
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,889
Do-hee.

253
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,099
You're up.

254
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,602
Mom.

255
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:12,854
Dad.

256
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:13,939
Hurry over here.

257
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,649
Or else you won't get any presents.

258
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,195
Madam Ju.

259
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,364
We need you for the star, Do-hee.

260
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,282
Come here.

261
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,456
Go ahead.

262
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,552
It's finally finished.

263
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,471
Should we have some cake now?

264
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,560
Gu-won.

265
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,329
I wish I could truly return them to you.

266
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,333
But this is…

267
00:22:58,627 --> 00:22:59,920
all I can do for you.

268
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,705
Why can't I untangle it?

269
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:39,167
How come it gets more tangled
the harder I try?

270
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,419
What the…

271
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,297
What are you doing?

272
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,174
You're up.

273
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:48,802
A Christmas tree?

274
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:49,719
Yes.

275
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,805
But it's harder than it looks.

276
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:54,766
Why don't you use your powers?

277
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,519
I just felt like decorating it with you.

278
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,979
Decorating's the fun part.

279
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,734
Actually, I had a dream
about Christmas last night.

280
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,028
Really?

281
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,113
How was it?

282
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,489
I was so happy

283
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,241
that I didn't want to wake up.

284
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,662
I should make you even happier.

285
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,248
Try it.

286
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,083
It's finally untangled.

287
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,212
Whatever.

288
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,047
I'll just use my powers.

289
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:27,632
I'll help you.

290
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,800
We still have time.

291
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,261
You're right.

292
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,350
But don't you think
the tree looks nice as is?

293
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,686
It's not a Christmas tree yet.
It's just a tree.

294
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,605
-It's just a tree?
-Yes.

295
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:42,856
You're right again.

296
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,338
That's piping hot.

297
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:09,341
My lips!

298
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:11,343
Drink some water.

299
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,367
FOR DO-HEE

300
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,911
-What's this?
-It's a present.

301
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,001
Do I look pretty?

302
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:45,919
Very.

303
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,825
I could've driven to work myself.

304
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,994
I should protect my man.

305
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,831
Then let me give you a ride
to work tomorrow.

306
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:23,957
No, thanks.

307
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,043
Right.

308
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:30,714
As you know,

309
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,300
I've failed at marriage once.

310
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,511
So I don't feel comfortable
being open about my relationship

311
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,513
with my colleagues.

312
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:41,808
You didn't fail at marriage.

313
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,810
You succeeded in getting a divorce.

314
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,021
Also,

315
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,690
I understand you no matter what.

316
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:50,567
Bok-gyu.

317
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:58,658
Lotus roots are in season,
so I made lotus root rice today.

318
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,787
Please don't skip your meals
even if you're busy.

319
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,415
You really know

320
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,792
how to move me.

321
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,127
I'm even more moved

322
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,505
by the fact that you're moved

323
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,215
by these little things.

324
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,469
Bok-gyu.

325
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,306
We're here.

326
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:24,184
Already?

327
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:31,858
Drive safely.

328
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,073
The drive to the theater
is just way too short.

329
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,574
I wish it took a lot longer to…

330
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,161
Ms. Shin! Your lunch box!

331
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,914
Ms. Shin!

332
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,458
Take your lunch box!

333
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,836
Take your lunch box, Ms. Shin!

334
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,089
-Ms. Shin!
-He's so cute.

335
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:58,051
No, that's not it!

336
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,639
Did you run a marathon or something?

337
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,015
I envy you.

338
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:04,933
FREE TASTING AT SUNWOL THEATER

339
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,727
You can move from place to place
at the snap of a finger.

340
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,819
That hits the spot.

341
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,488
What happened to your car
that you've barely paid for?

342
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,533
Did you see all the articles
about our performance?

343
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:24,994
"The birth of an overwhelmingly
refreshing experience."

344
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,996
"A breathtaking performance full of life."

345
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:30,375
To think I planned
this amazing performance.

346
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,585
I'm so proud of myself

347
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,129
I should drink some more

348
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,005
I'll take these too

349
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,385
What's that?

350
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:41,344
What are you drinking?

351
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,388
I'm taking good care of myself these days.

352
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,932
That's how I stay attractive.

353
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,103
Do you like Ms. Shin that much?

354
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,814
I've always dreamed
of dating a kind woman.

355
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,608
But she's not kind at all.

356
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:56,818
Exactly.

357
00:28:56,901 --> 00:29:00,321
When it comes to true love,
your preferences mean nothing.

358
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,615
But guess what her first name is.

359
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,325
Da-jeong, as in kind.

360
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,619
We're meant to be.

361
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,290
You said you were a shining solo.

362
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,917
Mirae F&B wants to collaborate with us.

363
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,169
You can take care of it.

364
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,671
Don't even think of bothering me.

365
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,133
I don't even have enough time
to be happy with Do-hee!

366
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,803
What do you think
you actually do for a living?

367
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:24,846
Being Do-hee's husband.

368
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,808
Are you going to Mirae F&B later?

369
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:35,815
Take this, then.

370
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,025
Is this a lunch box?

371
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,153
You didn't have to.

372
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,696
It's for Ms. Shin.

373
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,741
Are you sending me on an errand?

374
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:47,327
All I want you to do
is drop it off on the way.

375
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,080
I don't want to.

376
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:00,131
Then I'll have to go there myself.

377
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,175
I'd love to see her one more time.

378
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,178
Here I come, Ms. Shin!

379
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,323
I heard

380
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,534
about your past life

381
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,620
and how you and Do Do-hee got entangled.

382
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:36,084
Knowing that I stood no chance
at getting between you two

383
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,711
somehow puts me at ease.

384
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,840
Don't worry.

385
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,508
I won't tell Do Do-hee.

386
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:47,470
Do you still want to leave Korea?

387
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,014
Yes.

388
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:53,768
If it's because of me,

389
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,020
I'm okay now.

390
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,981
It's not because of you, but me.

391
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:00,942
My love

392
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,403
is poisonous to you.

393
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:08,533
Ms. Jin!

394
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:11,578
I'm coming!

395
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,707
I'll be leaving soon.

396
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,042
So do come to work more often.

397
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,715
I loved your performance.

398
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:26,342
You were great.

399
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,098
Tell me something I don't know.

400
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,525
Who in the world did this?

401
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,321
MIRAE F&B

402
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,072
Let's see here.

403
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,366
I'll do a reading on my social life today.

404
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,041
My goodness!

405
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,627
I thought it was Ms. Do again.

406
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,587
Can you see the future with these?

407
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,005
Not so much as the future,

408
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,298
but an inch ahead of you.

409
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,008
Let's do it!

410
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,301
How much is it?

411
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:09,552
Do you charge a lot?

412
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:14,641
This one. No!

413
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:20,563
This one. No!

414
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,691
You and Ms. Do

415
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,485
really are a match made in heaven.

416
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:27,862
This one.

417
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,537
It's the Lovers.

418
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,789
These two people

419
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:39,457
look familiar.

420
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,376
They're Adam and Eve from the Bible.

421
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,128
Behind them is the forbidden fruit
from the Garden of Eden.

422
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:45,505
The forbidden fruit?

423
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,215
This card

424
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,509
symbolizes the completion of love.

425
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,344
In other words,

426
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:52,512
a bed of roses.

427
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:54,847
A bed of roses?

428
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:57,934
A bed of roses.

429
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,610
Come to think of it,

430
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,029
I've never given Do-hee any flowers.

431
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,084
Just my luck.

432
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,756
Time for a break?

433
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,633
Ma'am,

434
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,261
I can't teach your kids.

435
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,515
You're the leading authority
on successor training.

436
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:39,308
If you can't teach them, who can?

437
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,019
-Who can?
-I'm sorry.

438
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,687
Who can…

439
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:44,814
Who else?

440
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,483
I will.

441
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,486
"A new leadership paradigm is needed

442
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,530
in this rapidly changing
business environment."

443
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:56,367
-"Servant leadership is one example."
-Stop it.

444
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,535
"Servant leadership…"

445
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,579
-"Servant leadership
-I said stop it.

446
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:01,581
-is based on respect for humanity
-Move.

447
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,332
-and each member of the group."
-Come on.

448
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,710
-"A servant leader
-I said move.

449
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:08,755
-considers each individual as a leader…"
-Knock it off already.

450
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,631
Hey!

451
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,716
Austin! Justin!

452
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,260
Let go.

453
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,929
Stay absolutely still.

454
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,973
Or else I'll make you regret it.

455
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,187
"They integrate
and empathize with the members…"

456
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,938
NOH SUK-MIN

457
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,317
Hi, Suk-min.

458
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:33,279
I'm in the middle of giving
successor training to Austin and Justin.

459
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,822
Yes. What?

460
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,033
Dinner?

461
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,038
NOH SUK-MIN

462
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:47,835
Yes?

463
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,171
Are you free this evening, Do-hee?

464
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,422
Why do you ask?

465
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,675
I'm planning a family gathering
so we can comfort one another.

466
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,052
Let's have dinner together.

467
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:57,887
Bring Mr. Jeong along.

468
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,516
I have plans today.

469
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,101
Then should we pick another day?

470
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,814
Please give me a chance
for my mother's sake.

471
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,359
We're family, after all.

472
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,787
Send me the money, damn it!

473
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,416
It's a sure bet this time.

474
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,335
Do you need help?

475
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,421
I think I can help you.

476
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,132
Are you a loan shark or something?

477
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,092
I have a higher status than that.

478
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:39,178
Way higher. Significantly higher, in fact.

479
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,014
-Are you from the bank?
-Forget it.

480
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,224
Answer me one question.

481
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,184
What kind of life have you been living?

482
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,270
What are you playing at now?

483
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:50,773
It's unlikely, but I want to make sure
you aren't a good person.

484
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,567
Consider it a loan approval process.

485
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,943
What are you babbling about?

486
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:57,196
You must think I'm some pushover
you can screw over,

487
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,198
but I've been in and out of prison
all my life!

488
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,158
Great!

489
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,617
You're more than qualified!

490
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,162
I'm a demon.

491
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,330
Make a deal with me,
and I'll grant your wish.

492
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,707
My wish?

493
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,458
Can it be anything?

494
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:12,420
I can't kill or resurrect people.

495
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,714
Nor can I turn back time
or meddle with natural disasters.

496
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,716
Other than that,
I can do anything you want.

497
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,677
But it comes with a price.

498
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,803
I knew it.

499
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,430
Still, it's simple.

500
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,724
Your soul must go to hell after ten years.

501
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,601
That's it. What do you say?

502
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,060
Ten years is a long time.

503
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,187
Let's do it.

504
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,981
-As foolish as expected.
-What?

505
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:34,483
You made the right choice.

506
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,278
What's with your hand?

507
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,571
Some kind of magic?

508
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,531
Don't mind it.

509
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,033
It'll be fine once you sign.

510
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:44,785
It's that bastard, sir.

511
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,080
Who are you to fool around on my turf?

512
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:51,459
Boss!

513
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,169
My hand is on fire. Want a deal?

514
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,171
-No!
-Anyone want a deal?

515
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:57,965
No?

516
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,217
Hurry up and sign!

517
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,428
Hey, hurry up!

518
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:11,979
I always knew you were no average Joe,

519
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,522
but a demon?

520
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,816
A demon?

521
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,110
That's badass, boss!

522
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,154
-That's badass, boss!
-That's badass, boss!

523
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,160
I didn't know you'd be so thrilled.

524
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:29,580
Anyway, what were you guys
doing back there?

525
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,958
We dabble in financial business.

526
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,876
As loan sharks?

527
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,879
I thought someone was
intruding on our turf,

528
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,173
so I was going to teach him a lesson.

529
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:44,720
But it turned out to be you
conducting this incredible ritual.

530
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:48,224
How could you not let us know
you were such an extraordinary being?

531
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:51,143
We'll follow you to hell, boss!

532
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,687
-We'll follow you, boss!
-We'll follow you, boss!

533
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,189
Do you even know what hell is like?

534
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,276
Suit yourselves then.

535
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,654
But first, leave the underworld

536
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,531
and take on a lawful occupation.

537
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:04,949
Then I'll accept you.

538
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,285
You all are such a hassle.

539
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,495
I'm taking these.

540
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,125
Take care, boss.

541
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,835
-Take care, boss!
-Take care, boss!

542
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:19,839
Leave…

543
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,341
Leave the underworld?

544
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,434
Give me every flower
that symbolizes happiness.

545
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,704
Good.

546
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:53,080
That was natural.

547
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,797
-Mr. Park?
-Yes?

548
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,175
I mean, you're mistaken.

549
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:06,302
You're obviously him.

550
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:07,762
Hold on.

551
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,263
I came to the wrong place.

552
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,063
What's with him?

553
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,783
What are you doing here, Bok-gyu?

554
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,621
How come everyone knows it's me?

555
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,664
How could I not?

556
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,291
I recognize my man from a mile away.

557
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,379
You're embarrassing me.

558
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,340
Here, your lunch box.

559
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:47,218
I took it with me by mistake.

560
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:53,307
You really didn't have to.

561
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,030
-Yes, I'll do that.
-All right.

562
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:15,746
What's this feeling of déjà vu?

563
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,208
Mr. Park!

564
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:21,168
You frustrate me to no end!

565
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,087
-What?
-Seriously,

566
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,588
you lack common sense

567
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,048
and manners!

568
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:28,801
I hate your guts!

569
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:35,391
Guess what? I hate you even more!

570
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,475
Oh no, you didn't!

571
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,269
How can you be so cold?

572
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:40,187
It's not that I'm cold.

573
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,023
It's that you're too hot!

574
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,316
Please don't get us wrong.

575
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,484
We are having a fight.

576
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,654
Obviously.

577
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,365
Are you really?

578
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:57,121
I don't know what happened,

579
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:58,998
but please calm down and talk--

580
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,124
Forget it!

581
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,625
It's impossible to talk to him.

582
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:07,548
How can someone lack warmth so completely?

583
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,675
You should let it go, Mr. Park.

584
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:12,928
That's just the way she is.

585
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:14,346
What do you mean?

586
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,973
I'd say she's pretty reasonable.

587
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,142
I guess she is.

588
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,437
By the way, is that a lunch box?

589
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,398
Yes, it is.

590
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:27,443
You really didn't have to.

591
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:28,360
Thank you.

592
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,196
-No, I mean…
-Goodness.

593
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,864
Thank you for this.

594
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,952
You're one generous man, Mr. Park.

595
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,246
Even my mom wouldn't do this.

596
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,748
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

597
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:42,833
Nice!

598
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,962
It's not for you.

599
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,424
I don't think I can make it today.

600
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:54,345
Come in.

601
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:02,561
What are those?

602
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,190
What's the occasion?

603
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,902
Today is a very special day.

604
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:12,613
It's not our 100th day together
or our wedding anniversary.

605
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:13,948
Nor is it my birthday.

606
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,908
So what's today?

607
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:19,495
It's one of the countless happy days
we'll be spending together.

608
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,164
If I'm with you,

609
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,917
every day calls for a celebration.

610
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,926
Your words are so sweet

611
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,678
that they could give me cavities.

612
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:41,850
I brought all the happiness
in the world to you.

613
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,021
This flower here symbolizes happiness.

614
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,942
This one symbolizes eternal happiness.

615
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:52,111
This one means
happiness that is meant to be.

616
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,655
Happiness that's been lost and found.

617
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:57,324
And this one…

618
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,790
I love you, Jeong Gu-won.

619
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:10,588
I love you too.

620
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,265
Come here.

621
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,475
-Do you like it?
-Of course.

622
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,690
What does this one symbolize?

623
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,445
That one…

624
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:36,989
Let me see.

625
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:38,574
It's not here.

626
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,118
-The red one…
-I knew it a minute ago.

627
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:58,404
WITHOUT POWERS, THE BODY OF A DEMON
IS NO DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF A HUMAN

628
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:05,244
A DEMON'S POWERS COME FROM
THE BRANDING ON THEIR BODY

629
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,919
I thought you were oblivious,
but were you only pretending?

630
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:29,435
How do you know the passcode to my safe?

631
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:36,191
Just how much do you know?

632
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,345
Perfect.

633
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:09,850
Do we have to go?

634
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,479
Noh Suk-min will be acting all friendly,

635
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,689
and I have a weaker stomach
than you think.

636
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,193
I can't avoid him forever.

637
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,028
I'm not the avoidant type either.

638
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,031
Also,

639
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,200
what do I have to fear
when you're with me?

640
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:29,786
Then…

641
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:32,414
let me know if you feel sick.

642
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,583
Don't just put up with it.

643
00:46:39,796 --> 00:46:42,132
The only thing in the world
that I'm not good at

644
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,510
is putting up with things.

645
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:45,427
Really?

646
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,764
That's my girl.

647
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,268
-Should we get going?
-Let's go.

648
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:59,149
Thank you all for coming
on such short notice.

649
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,735
Don't mention it.
Of course we should come.

650
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:03,946
Having you all gathered here

651
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:05,489
brings back memories. It's nice.

652
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:09,451
If only Mom could be here.

653
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,287
I'm sure she's in heaven.

654
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,455
She was baptized too.

655
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,959
Now that I've taken over her position,

656
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,835
I keep thinking about her.

657
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:21,171
You feel lonelier the higher you climb.

658
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,216
Imagine how lonely she must've been.

659
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:26,134
She wasn't lonely because of her position

660
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:29,012
but because she kept
even her children at arm's length.

661
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:32,015
I wonder why she was so cold to us

662
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,394
while she favored someone else's child.

663
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:39,064
Blood isn't everything, Su-ahn.

664
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:41,608
People who see eye to eye
and care about each other can be family.

665
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,527
Are you defending her
because you're also a Ju?

666
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,196
You can say that
because you're not her child.

667
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:50,200
It wasn't easy to live
as Chairwoman Ju Cheon-suk's child.

668
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:52,035
Our mother may be gone,

669
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:55,664
but the rest of us should leave
any grudges and misunderstandings behind.

670
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:57,374
Sure, I'm not one to hold a grudge.

671
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:59,835
The perpetrator
usually doesn't hold a grudge.

672
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:01,712
Perpetrator?

673
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:04,756
You talk as if I've done something.

674
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,717
That's a victim mentality.

675
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,136
That's because I am a victim.

676
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,178
So?

677
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:13,432
Are you saying
you're just an innocent victim?

678
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:17,436
Every time I tried to get the upper hand,
you turned the tables on me.

679
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:18,520
That's enough.

680
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:19,980
We're not here to fight.

681
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:22,983
Also, past mistakes are still mistakes.

682
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:24,610
Apologize, Su-ahn.

683
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:25,652
Suk-min!

684
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:27,237
Su-ahn.

685
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:31,617
I'm sorry.

686
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,659
Fine.

687
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,369
I admit my past mistakes.

688
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,378
Honey,

689
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,047
can you get us more wine?

690
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:47,883
Sure.

691
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,182
How's work, Suk-min?

692
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:56,975
As you all know,

693
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:58,685
our stockholders are quite conservative.

694
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:02,272
They may have looked up to Mother
as the founder,

695
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:05,442
but they'll try to find fault
with everything I do.

696
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,402
In light of that,

697
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:09,363
I need your full support.

698
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,698
You have my full support, Suk-min.

699
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,910
Here's my point.

700
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,579
How about you all

701
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:19,748
transfer your shares to me?

702
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:26,672
So that's what this was about.

703
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:32,010
It'd cost a fortune
to buy all of our shares though.

704
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:34,930
I'm sorry, but my answer is no.

705
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,516
But as long as you make the right choices,

706
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,975
you'll have my support.

707
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,811
What's right and wrong is subjective.

708
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:42,521
That's why I need my shares.

709
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:47,025
We might not always see eye to eye.

710
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,114
Thank you for the meal.

711
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:55,075
You haven't given me an answer.

712
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:59,079
This is my answer.

713
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,171
Let me ask you something.

714
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:11,883
Did you really not know
what Do-gyeong was up to?

715
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,930
Or did you just turn a blind eye?

716
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,439
You're out of line.

717
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,651
I just lost both my mother and son.

718
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:31,611
From the way you act,

719
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,197
I can't tell you're grieving.

720
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:42,497
Family gatherings never end well.

721
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:49,963
I hope you'll make the right choices.

722
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:56,303
I'll also…

723
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:59,639
give it some thought.

724
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,892
-Su-ahn.
-Yeah?

725
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,686
My kindness ends today.

726
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:24,581
You put up with him
pretty well back there.

727
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:26,500
You could tell?

728
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:29,211
Didn't you leave
to avoid punching him in the face?

729
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,672
You know everything about me now.

730
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,926
But I still know so little about you.

731
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:39,304
I could really use that demon manual.

732
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:43,016
When it comes to me,
what you see is what you get.

733
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:46,269
I'm a flawless being with special powers.

734
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:49,564
That's my man.

735
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:52,150
I think my stomach's upset.

736
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:56,071
I want to order in some fried chicken.

737
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:58,198
You just said your stomach was upset.

738
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:00,617
-How about some beer?
-I approve.

739
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:01,743
-You do?
-Yes.

740
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:02,661
Okay.

741
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:03,578
Let's do it.

742
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:06,540
-How's the speed for you?
-Just hold my hand.

743
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,586
INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

744
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:14,589
How can I help you?

745
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:17,759
A whistleblower came forward
about fraudulent use of funds.

746
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:19,511
That's absurd.

747
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:20,887
-Go ahead.
-Yes, sir.

748
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,107
Hello, Ju Seok-hoon speaking.

749
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:37,654
What?

750
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:41,533
What you ordered will be completed
by the end of the month.

751
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:47,038
This requires an official board meeting!

752
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,040
That'll be all.

753
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,090
Is this why you wanted all our shares?

754
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:59,718
Terminating the compensation committee
and full-time contracts?

755
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:01,011
This isn't right!

756
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,930
I'm just doing business.

757
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,349
This isn't business, but murder!

758
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:08,935
Listen.

759
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:12,272
This may look like a smart move now,
but it'll only do damage in the long run.

760
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:15,567
Don't try to pass off
your personal beliefs as facts.

761
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:20,196
I'll tell the press
and persuade the stockholders.

762
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,949
I'll do everything in my power
to stop you.

763
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:34,961
Inform the board of the motion
to dismiss CEO Ju Seok-hoon.

764
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:41,676
Let's find out

765
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:43,595
who has more power.

766
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:55,815
Feet off the desk.

767
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,905
I already cleaned over there!

768
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:11,790
Go do your job as Do Do-hee's husband
instead of hanging out here.

769
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:13,458
I'm here to see Ga-young

770
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:15,877
because she's leaving soon.

771
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,672
I guess you do care
about your human companion.

772
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:22,467
Stop it! This is a new outfit!

773
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:28,932
By the way, aren't you getting
that demon manual back?

774
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:32,769
No. Who cares
about a book full of threats?

775
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:33,979
Still, you should.

776
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:36,356
Missing manuals
can halve secondhand prices.

777
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:40,026
Stop treating me like some home appliance!

778
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,737
But I still know so little about you.

779
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:45,949
I could really use that demon manual.

780
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:51,830
Are you done being angry?

781
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:53,665
I'm going to get that manual back.

782
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:58,545
I knew you'd give in in the end.

783
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:05,760
Hi, Seok-hoon.

784
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:06,803
Do-hee.

785
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,597
Suk-min has revealed his true colors.

786
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:28,616
Cut off her communication with the outside

787
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,995
and keep her hospitalized
until further notice.

788
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:32,954
Yes, sir.

789
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:37,625
I've handled your orders
about your wife, sir.

790
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,173
You can't enter, ma'am!

791
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:45,550
Is this your management style?

792
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:48,762
Pushing things through with the support
of the directors on your side?

793
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,226
Madam Ju prioritized

794
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:58,063
balancing profits
and social responsibility.

795
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:00,190
-How could you throw that away--
-You seem to

796
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:02,108
really look up to my mother.

797
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:06,196
I know why you're doing this.

798
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,991
You want to surpass Madam Ju.

799
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:14,370
Do you think
you can keep up with her this way?

800
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:15,455
No.

801
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:18,583
This only proves
that you can't even compare to her.

802
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:21,544
How much longer are you planning
to stay in her shadow?

803
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:23,838
Accept it, Do-hee.

804
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:25,965
My mother's world has come to an end.

805
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:29,928
I've cracked my way out of the egg.

806
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:33,973
It's Gi Kwang-chul's phone.

807
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:40,063
TO ABRAXAS

808
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:52,075
Abraxas.

809
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:58,289
"The bird fights its way out of the egg."

810
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,292
"To be born,

811
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:05,004
one must first destroy a world."

812
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,927
The world you have destroyed…

813
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:16,432
is Ju Cheon-suk.

814
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:28,069
This is your problem.

815
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:31,698
If you had stayed out of it,
everyone would've been safe.

816
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:34,826
But you always cause trouble
by never letting anything go.

817
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:38,913
If not for you,

818
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:40,999
we wouldn't have ended up here.

819
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:46,379
Why do you have to go this far?

820
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:50,842
To avenge dear Madam Ju Cheon-suk?

821
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:56,222
I suppose she's like a god to you.

822
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:59,893
How could you…

823
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:03,438
How could you kill your own mother?

824
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,440
That old woman was the devil.

825
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:07,609
The reason I ended up like this

826
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:09,152
is your precious Almighty Ju.

827
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:14,491
I was a sinner
even before I committed any sins.

828
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:17,118
She dumped her sins on me, her own child,

829
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:19,078
and went so far as to blame my blood!

830
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,163
Why?

831
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:23,833
Because the more worthless I seemed,
the more she stood out.

832
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:35,094
I always thought you were good at nothing,

833
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,764
but there's one thing you're good at.

834
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:40,433
Blaming others.

835
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:47,065
Let's test and see
how far your steadfast faith can go.

836
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,567
You should be thanking me.

837
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,320
I took revenge on her for you.

838
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:54,989
What?

839
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:57,116
You think your parents
died in an accident.

840
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:00,828
But that's not true.

841
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:02,747
They were killed by Ju Cheon-suk,

842
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:05,166
whom you relied on the most.

843
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:08,503
Your Almighty Ju,
whom you trusted completely,

844
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:11,714
was the one who killed your parents.

845
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:28,731
It's all done.

846
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:44,872
That's much better.

847
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:47,458
But the water pressure is so low here.

848
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:50,295
Fancy seeing you here.

849
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:51,254
What a coincidence.

850
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:55,383
Have you been following me?

851
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:56,593
No way.

852
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,428
I just had to use the bathroom.

853
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:05,184
You don't seem surprised.

854
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:07,895
All right.

855
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:09,981
I have a question for you,

856
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:10,940
so this is great.

857
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,067
Noh Do-gyeong

858
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:15,403
took something important from me.

859
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:17,989
It's a green hardcover book.

860
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:20,658
Have you seen it?

861
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:26,581
No, I'm afraid not.

862
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:33,004
Did Noh Suk-min do that?

863
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:35,465
I just

864
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:38,009
burned myself while cooking.

865
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:41,346
I don't really care
how it really happened.

866
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:42,430
But…

867
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:46,142
it seems like your hell has just begun.

868
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:52,023
Let me know if you find the book.

869
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:54,067
Who knows?

870
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:55,777
That might be…

871
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:59,864
your ticket out of hell.

872
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:07,997
I'm off.

873
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:22,512
Bullshit.

874
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:25,807
You really expect me to believe that?

875
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:40,238
I was there on the day your parents died.

876
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:45,410
The company is at a crossroads.

877
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:49,080
An investment offer this big
doesn't come by so often!

878
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:51,499
You leave me no choice.

879
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:55,086
I'll expose everything.

880
01:02:03,177 --> 01:02:05,054
How dare you blackmail me?

881
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:06,973
What do you want?

882
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,182
Is it money?

883
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:12,603
You're the one
who quit the company and took off.

884
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:14,897
What gives you the right?

885
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:19,026
This is my company.

886
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:21,529
You didn't build it alone.

887
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:23,906
It was built
on the blood, sweat, and tears

888
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,700
of everyone who works here!

889
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:28,661
-Honey.
-Wait and see.

890
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:32,123
It won't go as you want.

891
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:46,846
Furious, my mother
drove after your parents' car,

892
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,473
and you know what happened next.

893
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:50,308
Boom!

894
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:56,189
Mirae Electronics
grew into Mirae Group after that.

895
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:00,735
You could say
your parents' blood laid the foundation.

896
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:05,198
I don't believe it.

897
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:09,660
My mother used to believe in nothing,
let alone have any religion.

898
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:12,580
But she started going to confession
day in and day out after their death!

899
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:13,790
Why do you think?

900
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:16,167
What was she so desperate to wash away?

901
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,044
Just what was she so afraid of?

902
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:23,716
All the favors and affection
she showered on you

903
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:27,261
were actually her ticket to heaven.

904
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:28,679
No.

905
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:31,474
That's a lie.

906
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,142
You're lying!

907
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,106
Then ask her yourself.

908
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,442
Whether she's in heaven or hell,

909
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:43,402
go ask her yourself!

910
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:01,754
It's all his doing!

911
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:06,968
Noh Suk-min killed
both his mother and Do-gyeong!

912
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,472
He was also the one
who tried to kill Do Do-hee.

913
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:21,232
Noh Suk-min, that bastard,

914
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:23,401
is the devil.

915
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:30,968
There is one piece of evidence
Noh Suk-min failed to get rid of.

916
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:34,680
How did you gather all this information
without him knowing?

917
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:37,600
Is it true?
Did my brother really kill my mother?

918
01:05:39,226 --> 01:05:41,938
Is it true that Ju Cheon-suk
killed Do-hee's parents?

919
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:45,066
Wait and see. It won't go as you want.

920
01:05:45,149 --> 01:05:47,068
After what I've been through
to build this company…

921
01:05:47,151 --> 01:05:48,611
This has to be made public.

922
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:50,237
How dare you try to destroy my company?

923
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:52,239
I'll stop you if it's the last thing I do.

924
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,951
I can tell you're desperate for something.

925
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:57,119
Do you want me to grant your wish?

926
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:06,045
