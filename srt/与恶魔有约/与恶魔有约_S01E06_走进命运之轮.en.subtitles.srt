1
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:20,288
EMERGENCY SOS IN…

2
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:27,212
I NEED HELP. SOS!

3
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,005
LOCATION:
334, BANPO-DONG, SEOCHO-GU, SEOUL

4
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,614
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached.

5
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,676
It's still not done?

6
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,219
TEMPORARILY OUT OF SERVICE

7
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,595
I have to go up right now.

8
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,347
EMERGENCY STAIRS

9
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,034
No…

10
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,870
No!

11
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,846
Do Do-hee, please…

12
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,273
No!

13
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,233
Don't!

14
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:13,902
Please don't!

15
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,487
Please stop!

16
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,410
No!

17
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,786
Please!

18
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,691
Jeong Gu-won.

19
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,401
Do Do-hee.

20
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,252
Do Do-hee,

21
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,045
are you okay?

22
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,493
It's okay.

23
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,788
It's all over now.

24
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:23,174
EPISODE 6
INTO THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE

25
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:35,895
Thanks.

26
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:38,564
Are you sure
you don't want to go see a doctor?

27
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:48,908
No one's here.

28
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,245
The electronic lock is broken though.

29
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,207
He was enjoying it.

30
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,088
He seemed to take pleasure in my terror.

31
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,967
It was as if he was there to watch me die.

32
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:08,928
And…

33
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:10,638
that song.

34
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,273
Killing me wasn't his only goal.

35
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,650
He was about to capture the prey

36
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,360
he had missed many times.

37
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,237
He must've been thrilled.

38
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,323
You seem very familiar
with how a murderer thinks.

39
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,577
I'm familiar with how a predator thinks.

40
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:37,915
My phone.

41
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,084
It's here.

42
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,544
It was on the floor.

43
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,851
It's not him.

44
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,020
It's a different person.

45
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,440
-What?
-He looks nothing like the one

46
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,858
who tried to kill you before.

47
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,694
Then could there be more than one--

48
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:07,862
Hold on.

49
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,364
Are those scratches on his neck?

50
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,418
The driver also had them.

51
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:23,878
Could it be

52
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,422
he's changing his face?

53
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,592
That's why I couldn't find him.

54
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,886
I never saw his real face.

55
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,681
What do you mean he changes his face?

56
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,725
Like, with disguises?

57
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,376
Mr. Jeong.

58
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,712
You two are hiding something from me.

59
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,173
How did you save Do-hee?

60
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:12,009
She was hanging from the railing,
but how'd you end up on the stairs--

61
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,636
If you're so curious,

62
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,137
ask her yourself.

63
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,682
I'm asking you because she won't tell me.

64
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,809
Then I'm sure she has her reasons.

65
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,399
Do-hee has been on her own
since she was a kid,

66
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,193
so she's independent
and keeps her problems to herself.

67
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,529
That's why she's refusing to tell me.

68
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:35,533
But I must know
exactly what she's going through.

69
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,034
And what gives you the right?

70
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,955
I'm the only one on her side.

71
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,543
What do you even mean
by being on her side?

72
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,545
I hurt when she hurts,

73
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,631
and I'm happy when she's happy.

74
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:57,972
I can't tell where I end and she begins.

75
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,140
That's what I mean.

76
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:05,938
So tell me
what she's hiding from me right now.

77
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,108
Don't worry.

78
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,569
You're not the only one on her side.

79
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:10,753
Are you okay?

80
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,716
What are you doing out here?

81
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:18,803
Until now,

82
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,808
I'd been taking death too lightly.

83
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,645
Not because I was brave

84
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,025
but because I didn't know
what it was really like to die.

85
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,698
That feeling when the world
you believed in disappears…

86
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:44,036
and you're left completely alone.

87
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:53,921
He was…

88
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,801
hovering around me all the time
to kill me.

89
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,846
The security guard I greeted this morning

90
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,889
or the employee I talked to yesterday…

91
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,058
He could be anyone.

92
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:08,894
Tomorrow,

93
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:14,483
he'll be out to get me again
with a different face.

94
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,906
Don't fight this dangerous battle
by yourself anymore.

95
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:32,918
Do-hee.

96
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,380
Let's get married.

97
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,931
You don't have to be all alone.

98
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,168
How about…

99
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,715
you marry me instead?

100
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:19,024
MIRAE F&B

101
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:26,198
Don't fight this dangerous battle
by yourself anymore.

102
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,616
Let's get married.

103
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,577
How about…

104
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,413
you marry me instead?

105
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,796
I need some time to think.

106
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,851
SAMPLE DESIGNS

107
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,570
Life sure is a series of choices.

108
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:11,327
Let's decide based on the response we get
within and outside the company.

109
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,244
Yes, ma'am.

110
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:19,001
She's weighing me over a mere human?

111
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,213
A YOUNG LEADER,
CEO OF MIRAE INVESTMENT, JU SEOK-HOON

112
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:28,677
What?

113
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,888
Let's rendezvous. Look behind you.

114
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,147
What's with the rendezvous?

115
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,357
Are we spies or something?

116
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,818
Who knows what that AI-like secretary
might do to me if she sees me?

117
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,530
My neck still aches
from being struck by her.

118
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,991
You exaggerate too much.

119
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:51,909
Ta-da!

120
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,829
Lunch prepared by Bok-gyu with love.

121
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,373
You may cry if you're touched.

122
00:15:58,916 --> 00:15:59,959
Did Ga-young send you?

123
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,503
-No, she didn't.
-Then why are you here?

124
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,298
You stormed out during a rehearsal
and stayed out all night, so Star Jin was…

125
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,760
No, I was worried sick.

126
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,136
So you are a spy.

127
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,262
Darn it.

128
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,181
Why did you storm out like that anyway?

129
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,350
It was as if your butt was on fire.

130
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,519
Do Do-hee could've really died this time.

131
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,855
But thanks to that, we found out
that the culprit disguises his face.

132
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,484
And then I proposed to Do Do-hee.

133
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,196
But that's no news to anyone, is it?

134
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,158
"Mirae heir turned down
at the speed of light."

135
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,494
Such a killer headline.

136
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,787
That's not it.

137
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:41,041
I'm the one who did it this time.

138
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,459
I proposed to her.

139
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,713
-Understand?
-What?

140
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,132
You proposed to her?

141
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,301
Why would you do that
after rejecting her at the speed of light?

142
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,472
I guess that's no longer news
to anyone either.

143
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,768
You said it'd be crazy to marry a human.

144
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,978
So why?

145
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:04,023
What changed your mind all of a sudden?

146
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,190
It's just…

147
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,819
It'd be indecent of me to hold
a married woman's wrist all the time.

148
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,612
What kind of demon is so moral?

149
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,531
Why shouldn't I be?

150
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,575
Let me get this straight.

151
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,577
Does that mean you'll be

152
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,245
a married demon?

153
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,709
What is it?

154
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,004
Once Star Jin finds out,
all hell will break loose.

155
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,423
I held my breath for nothing.

156
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,426
So you think that doesn't concern you?

157
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,219
If you marry Ms. Do,

158
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,847
you'll be breaking the hearts of many.

159
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,027
Let's see here.

160
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,404
My social life…
That's not what's important.

161
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,655
But my dating life is.

162
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,076
Considering the recent events,
I might be in luck.

163
00:17:58,786 --> 00:17:59,787
"The Hermit"?

164
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,497
That's not right.

165
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,707
I must have picked it too carelessly.

166
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,459
I'll try again.

167
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,589
Not this again!

168
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,050
Is the hermit so bad?

169
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,635
Obviously.

170
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,638
It symbolizes an old fossil
long out of the dating game.

171
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:20,849
It couldn't be worse when I'm up against
the demonic Ms. Do…

172
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,363
Come to my office.

173
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,868
I should've done a reading
on my social life after all.

174
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,163
Ms. Choi, good luck in the room of truth.

175
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,917
She can be so clueless sometimes.

176
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,131
I heard a rumor.

177
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,632
It's a false rumor, ma'am.

178
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,718
I may criticize others to their face,
but never behind their backs.

179
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:57,928
I heard

180
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,389
that you're an excellent tarot reader.

181
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,306
I apologize…

182
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:03,725
Pardon?

183
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,647
This one?

184
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,565
No.

185
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:10,941
That one?

186
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,987
You don't have to be this careful.

187
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,114
Don't jinx it.

188
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,668
"Wheel of Fortune"?

189
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,712
This card

190
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,840
usually symbolizes a reunion.

191
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:39,636
I need more details.

192
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,973
While our fortune may repeat itself
under heaven's plan and design,

193
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:47,060
the direction in which it moves
depends on man's will and wit.

194
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,103
That's what it means.

195
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,150
What does this Roman numeral mean?

196
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,735
This is the tenth card.

197
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,196
Number ten is a completion,

198
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,324
symbolizing both the end
and a new beginning.

199
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:07,998
"The end and a new beginning"?

200
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,507
Is it that good?

201
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,926
I should eat well

202
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,178
so I can survive
when all hell breaks loose.

203
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,933
Whoever made this is an amazing cook.

204
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,436
Bok-gyu, you're officially
ready to get married.

205
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,648
I'm not just saying this
because I made it,

206
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:37,444
but the meat was cooked perfectly
between medium rare and rare.

207
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,910
Hi, Seok-hoon.

208
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,204
What's that?

209
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,747
What's with the flowers?

210
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:50,666
Here.

211
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,754
I thought you'd find a bouquet too cheesy.

212
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:01,134
But I felt bad about proposing to you
so abruptly without any flowers.

213
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,511
It all happened too fast.

214
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,391
Would you like a drink?

215
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,142
Yes. I mean, no.

216
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,811
I already had a drink.

217
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:13,897
How's your hand?

218
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:15,774
It's all right.

219
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,401
That's a relief.

220
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:31,790
This is funny.

221
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,334
Why are we so awkward?

222
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,170
Why are you laughing?

223
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,884
What's so funny?

224
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,512
What could possibly be that funny?

225
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,807
Director Jeong, are you getting jealous?

226
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,183
Jealous?

227
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,436
I never understand why people get jealous.

228
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,814
It was then that he realized
he no longer understood himself.

229
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:58,775
Here comes Ms. Shin.

230
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,076
Hey, that's mine.

231
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,996
I still remember

232
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:14,207
what a rebellious teen you were
when we first met.

233
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,126
To think that you proposed to me.

234
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,795
You've come a long way, Seok-hoon.

235
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,339
At least I was in middle school.

236
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,257
You were still in elementary school, Dodo.

237
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,428
To think you'll be getting married.

238
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:28,513
Unbelievable.

239
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,265
I know.

240
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:32,726
I find it hard to believe myself.

241
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,937
Me, getting married.

242
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,774
About my proposal.

243
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,109
It wasn't just on a whim.

244
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,238
When I first heard
that you'd gone on a blind date,

245
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,573
my heart dropped.

246
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:51,912
And I felt so jealous
when you proposed to Mr. Jeong.

247
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,623
That's when I realized

248
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,500
that my feelings for you

249
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,044
were different from before.

250
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,635
I didn't come here
to pressure you or anything,

251
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:07,928
but I guess I did.

252
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,599
It's just that

253
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,061
it came as a surprise.

254
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:20,774
I always considered you my family.

255
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,734
Let's be a real family now.

256
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,780
If marriage is what you need,
let's become a family first.

257
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:30,742
And then we can take our time
figuring out the rest.

258
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,495
I can wait.

259
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,586
Pleasure…

260
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,349
That hits the spot.

261
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:59,354
You seem to be getting
the hang of work life.

262
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,649
Why do humans drink this crap?

263
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,611
Look, I have a question.

264
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:10,740
What does it mean when a human
saves someone as their emergency contact?

265
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:12,951
That means…

266
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,330
that the person
trusts the other more than anyone.

267
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,248
100 TIPS FOR YOUR FIRST LOVE

268
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,542
-Really?
-Yes.

269
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,002
More than anyone?

270
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,299
Hold on.

271
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,054
Then Ju Seok-hoon too?

272
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:35,432
This is bad.

273
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,438
Give me that.

274
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:43,857
Page 125.

275
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,290
So you came here to see me, not Do Do-hee?

276
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,709
What an equal business relationship.

277
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:05,670
You get to address your employer
so informally.

278
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,465
Our relationship was personal
before it turned professional.

279
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,470
You turned her down.

280
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,848
Why are you swaying her now?

281
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:20,644
What I dislike is marriage, not Do Do-hee.

282
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,564
Don't toy with her emotions.

283
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:27,609
You know better than anyone
how desperate she is right now.

284
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:30,695
Unfortunately,

285
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,155
I'm not fooling around either.

286
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,411
Mr. Jeong, Ms. Do is heading out.

287
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,664
Please excuse me. I'm busy.

288
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,794
Remember your place as her bodyguard,
and don't cross the line.

289
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,006
There's no line I can't cross.

290
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,482
Can I ask you something?

291
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,988
Why did you save me and Ju Seok-hoon

292
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,407
as your emergency contacts?

293
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:19,828
You're my bodyguard,

294
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,665
and Seok-hoon is like family.

295
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,130
What about you?

296
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,215
Why did you propose to me?

297
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,302
You turned me down
at the speed of light before.

298
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,887
Why does everyone ask the same thing?

299
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,061
Just because.

300
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,947
Chairman Noh Suk-min of Mirae Group
will give a speech

301
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,949
to celebrate the groundbreaking.

302
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:04,331
2023 MIRAE GROUP'S 2ND CHEONAN FACTORY
GROUNDBREAKING CEREMONY

303
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:07,208
I'm overwhelmed
to finally be standing here.

304
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:11,880
The ambitions that Mirae Group has
for the second Cheonan factory

305
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,465
are immeasurable.

306
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:18,303
This factory will enable a secure supply
of high-quality packing materials…

307
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,865
What is she doing here?

308
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,242
Honey.

309
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,043
We'll continue to prepare Mirae Group…

310
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,461
Why so surprised?

311
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,130
You never show up at events like this.

312
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,840
You think they're superficial.

313
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,302
Sometimes, superficial actions
can go a long way.

314
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,807
…sincerely thank everyone
who has supported us along the way,

315
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:08,728
including Mayor Ahn Jin-suk
and Assemblyman Seong U-chan.

316
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,772
Thank you.

317
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:20,448
The host made a mistake.

318
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,117
You're not the chairman

319
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,411
but the acting chairman.

320
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:28,832
We don't need to advertise
the unstable situation we're in, do we?

321
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,251
So it wasn't a mistake.

322
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,504
I'm getting married tomorrow.

323
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,634
Let us move on
to the climax of today's ceremony,

324
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:41,594
the symbolic groundbreaking.

325
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:44,097
I didn't have time
to prepare wedding invitations.

326
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,641
But you understand, right?

327
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:47,976
We're family, after all.

328
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:47,911
You're so clumsy.

329
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:27,200
My health is a priority,
even in the important moments of my life.

330
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:29,202
I can't skip my daily routine, can I?

331
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,747
I hope I don't get too nervous
or cry later.

332
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,707
I can do this, right?

333
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,918
Please show your support

LCSB.

336
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:43,925
Is this right?

337
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,426
It doesn't sound right.

338
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,263
That's what all YouTubers say these days.

339
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,222
LCSB!

340
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,432
Great job, ma'am.

341
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,018
The first part of the ceremony consists of

342
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,062
a processional, bowing,
vows, ring exchange,

343
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,356
declaration of marriage,
celebratory singing and speeches,

344
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,149
recessional, and pictures.

345
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,610
The second part consists of
the couple's entrance, cake cutting,

346
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,445
champagne showers, entertaining--

347
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,488
Let's keep it simple.

348
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,742
I just wanted to live up
to the expectations

349
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,286
of Chairwoman Ju.

350
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:16,291
Then please simplify it just a tiny bit.

351
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,042
I'll get back to you.

352
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,590
This will be a huge hit.
An exclusive cover of the wedding!

353
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,510
"Do Do-hee drink" already shows up
when we search for your wedding!

354
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:28,845
That's great.

355
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:31,472
Let me share a supportive message with you

356
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,641
so you don't get too nervous or cry.

357
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,603
-You chicken?
-Thank you, ma'am.

358
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,147
Ms. Do!

359
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,108
I've never seen you more beautiful.
I mean it, Ms. Do!

360
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,703
How do you feel, Madam Ju?

361
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,748
Are you happy now?

362
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,419
Is this what you wanted?

363
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,762
What's with your dress?

364
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,183
Couldn't you have picked
a more elegant one?

365
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:18,686
I know this is a marriage of convenience,

366
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,856
but how could you let
your secretary pick your dress?

367
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,526
This is your wedding after all.

368
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,987
It's supposed to reflect your taste.

369
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,989
Your taste is what sets you apart.

370
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:32,700
You and your nagging.

371
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,245
If you keep this up,
you'll always be an outcast.

372
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,872
You're one to talk.

373
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:41,209
You're the biggest outcast in our family.

374
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,921
Don't you have anything nice to say?

375
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,881
It's my wedding after all.

376
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,844
Here's something I learned from plants.

377
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:55,473
When two mutants breed,

378
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,809
they produce non-mutant descendants.

379
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,852
Isn't that incredible?

380
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,854
It's a brilliant puzzle of nature.

381
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:05,733
Such a combination
is also desirable in marriage.

382
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,735
You two are a good example.

383
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:11,322
Because both of you
are the biggest mutants ever.

384
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,577
You should've been our officiant.

385
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,705
I ruled you out
because you'd bore everyone.

386
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,164
You darned little brat.

387
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,333
Don't be so harsh on a dead person.

388
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,092
What is it like there?

389
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,387
How are you getting by?

390
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:37,056
Do you even know where I am?

391
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,518
Let me see.

392
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,522
They say rich people
can't get into heaven,

393
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:46,774
so that wouldn't be it.

394
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,610
You couldn't be in hell either

395
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,781
because you're a better person
than you let on.

396
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,418
Where in the world did you go, Madam Ju?

397
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,131
Leaving me here alone.

398
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:19,849
I'm in your memory.

399
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:28,024
Where else could I be?

400
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,763
Are you ready, ma'am?

401
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,530
Wish me luck with the puzzle.

402
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:37,927
You did it.

403
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:41,639
You're here. I didn't expect you to come.

404
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:44,225
Like I said, we're family.

405
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:47,145
You look great in your dress.

406
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,982
Mother would've been
so happy to see you today.

407
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,692
Too bad she couldn't be here.

408
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,445
Congratulations. I mean it.

409
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,117
Thank you. I mean it.

410
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,129
Sit over here.

411
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:17,884
Look at her all triumphant.

412
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,927
When will you break the story?

413
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,054
Today is a happy day.

414
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,098
Let her enjoy it.

415
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:29,145
It is time to welcome the star of the day.

416
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,939
-Where's my seat?
-Here comes the bride.

417
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:37,612
Everyone, please give
a warm welcome to the bride.

418
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,110
Why did you propose to me?

419
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,156
Just because.

420
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,828
I don't want you to die.

421
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,483
At this hour, I take you,
the most precious and beautiful bride,

422
00:37:57,566 --> 00:38:00,611
Do Do-hee, to be my wife.

423
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:05,449
At this hour, I take you,
the most precious and dashing groom,

424
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,202
Jeong Gu-won, to be my husband.

425
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:12,081
I will stand by you through thick and thin

426
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:14,917
and always put you first.

427
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:19,547
I will accept, respect, and love you

428
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,299
the way you are.

429
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:25,386
A premarital agreement?

430
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,683
I wrote up a simple contract.

431
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,354
"Party A and Party B shall appear…"

432
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,857
"Party A and Party B shall appear

433
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,734
as an ideal couple in public."

434
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,570
"In privacy, both parties
shall respect boundaries

435
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,572
and not intrude into each other's spaces."

436
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,241
"Both parties shall cooperate
to achieve their goals."

437
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,617
"The contract shall expire…

438
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,869
"The contract shall expire…

439
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:51,954
…when both parties
have achieved their goals."

440
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,457
…when both parties
have achieved their goals."

441
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,458
PARTY A: DO DO-HEE
PARTY B: JEONG GU-WON

442
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:05,134
The bride and groom will now
make their way back down the aisle,

443
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:08,095
taking their first step into the world
as a married couple.

444
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:10,973
It symbolizes their vow

445
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,225
to walk side by side
for the rest of their lives--

446
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,268
Stop!

447
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:17,730
Hold on a second. I'm sorry.

448
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,192
"The rest of our lives"?
That wasn't part of the deal.

449
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:25,529
It's a customary expression.

450
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:26,447
Just play along.

451
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,032
No.

452
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,659
As a demon, I take contracts
and promises very seriously.

453
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,287
The rest of my life is extremely long.

454
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:45,800
Excuse me.

455
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,721
Remove "the rest of their lives."

456
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,307
Yes, ma'am.

457
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,980
The couple will make their way
back down the aisle.

458
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,483
There's no meaning behind it whatsoever.

459
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,318
The bride and groom, everyone!

460
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,446
Please join me in congratulating them.

461
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,953
He's too handsome to be a bodyguard.

462
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,084
You look beautiful!

463
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,672
Ms. Choi, can't you applaud for real?

464
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,674
I was rooting for another couple.

465
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:27,591
What?

466
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,136
Me and Mr. Jeong.

467
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,996
What are you so giddy about, Su-ahn?

468
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:00,749
The higher you fly, the harder you fall.

469
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:31,530
What's wrong?

470
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,576
It's nothing.

471
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,791
Turn toward each other and show some love!

472
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,593
Try a little harder, will you?

473
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:58,390
Is this enough?

474
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,604
It's too much. Take it easy.

475
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:06,273
You're so picky.

476
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,778
Director Jeong really is the best.

477
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:12,905
You seem to imply

478
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:15,658
that Ms. Do isn't the best.

479
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:17,618
That's not what I meant,

480
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,870
but I won't bother correcting you.

481
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:26,335
Take that.

482
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:28,629
And that.

483
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,299
Give each other a kiss!

484
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,302
That's private.

485
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,638
I heard you're only marrying him
for the inheritance.

486
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,306
Kissing is no problem.

487
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,351
Is this really necessary?

488
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,855
"Party A and Party B shall appear

489
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,983
as an ideal couple in public."

490
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:51,777
Fine,

491
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:53,696
here goes.

492
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,376
Time for some solo shots.

493
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:51,962
Let's start with the groom.

494
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,270
Seok-hoon.

495
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:15,611
I guess I fell short.

496
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:17,363
No way.

497
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:19,698
You're absolutely perfect.

498
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,120
To me,

499
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,458
you'll always be the family I can rely on.

500
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:33,837
I'm always on your side, Do-hee.

501
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,840
Thanks.

502
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:47,643
Even though Mr. Jeong
is equally rude to everyone,

503
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:50,771
he's still good to you, right?

504
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:56,735
He isn't someone I can simply label

505
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,780
as either good or bad.

506
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:18,132
Is this what you're into, Ms. Shin?

507
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,008
Let's go home, babe.

508
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,266
"Babe"?

509
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:28,809
Do you prefer "honey"?

510
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:32,771
See you.

511
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:41,822
Hey, don't gaze at a married woman
with such intense emotion.

512
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,115
There are eyes everywhere!

513
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:53,083
When will it be my turn?

514
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,065
BIRTH OF THE CINDERELLA MAN…
EXCLUSIVE WEDDING FOOTAGE

515
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:21,612
She found out already?

516
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,906
I thought she'd be too busy rehearsing.

517
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:26,867
Ms. Jin, please open the door.

518
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,203
-How long has she been like this?
-Well…

519
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,044
Star Jin, I was going to tell you

520
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,796
-right after the press conference.
-Shut up.

521
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,883
I'm more upset with you than with him.

522
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:49,181
Their marriage

523
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:52,476
is just a peaceful means
to maintain his powers.

524
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,019
What's peaceful about marriage?

525
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,480
It's more violent than anything.

526
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,069
You're coming back, right?

527
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,780
I trust you, Star Jin!

528
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,325
She's a professional,

529
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:10,369
so she'll definitely come back.

530
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,043
Your fingerprint has been registered.

531
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,837
What if the lock breaks again?

532
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:03,839
This one is basically indestructible.

533
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:05,048
Come in.

534
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,804
So this is where Do Do-hee lives.

535
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,062
Let me make something clear.

536
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:22,274
I was only forced to move in here
because the culprit might break in…

537
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:23,609
Watch out, Do Do-hee!

538
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:27,070
Did the bastard already break in?

539
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,281
What was he looking for
to make such a mess?

540
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:34,328
I've been busy preparing for the wedding.

541
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:37,331
Just sit wherever.

542
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,668
So the place wasn't broken into?

543
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,420
Stop exaggerating.

544
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:45,839
Nice and homey, don't you think?

545
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:52,971
Your wrist.

546
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:06,526
This is what "homey" looks like.

547
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,195
It's finally neat enough to call home.

548
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,446
Can you cook with this?

549
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,324
I want homemade food.

550
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,242
Forget it.

551
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:16,620
I'm your husband, not your slave.

552
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:18,997
Do me just one more favor.

553
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:26,296
I threw away my favorite blouse
by mistake.

554
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:29,091
How could that possibly happen?

555
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:39,810
CLOTHING BIN

556
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:46,900
Not this one.

557
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:05,919
There it is.

558
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,047
What? It's ruined.

559
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:11,842
No, it isn't.

560
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,637
-Clean up before you come in.
-Why should I…

561
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,141
That blouse looks familiar.

562
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:28,191
Hurry up!

563
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:51,298
That'll wake me up.

564
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:04,895
SUNWOL FOUNDATION

565
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:11,526
SUNWOL FOUNDATION IN AN OLD NEWSPAPER
HYEONMYEONG DAILY

566
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:16,364
JUNE 7, 1977
CONSTRUCTION OF SUNWOL THEATER COMPLETE

567
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:28,335
Hello, this is Ju Seok-hoon
from Mirae Investment.

568
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:31,838
I'd like to request some articles
regarding Sunwol Foundation

569
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,924
as I'm considering making an investment.

570
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:37,052
Do you happen to keep
really old issues in your archives?

571
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:39,054
JUNE 7, 1977

572
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,275
Grandma? But she's gone.

573
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,363
Everything belongs to my dad now,
and it'll all be mine soon.

574
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:02,160
Nice tattoo.

575
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:04,830
It looks good on you.

576
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:26,101
Noh Do-gyeong.

577
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,063
Is it you?

578
00:52:58,884 --> 00:52:59,718
Did you wash up?

579
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:04,472
Yes, as you can see.

580
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:07,142
Did you?

581
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:09,102
Yes, as you can see.

582
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:10,645
I washed up.

583
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:16,735
I've never seen you
dressed like that before.

584
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,113
Likewise.

585
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:31,207
Hey, so…

586
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,251
Are you going to bed now?

587
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:34,669
What else is there to do?

588
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:40,008
You should go to bed.

589
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:42,427
It's late.

590
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:44,971
I know.

591
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:48,683
I'm so tired.

592
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,279
What do you mean,
"What else is there to do?"

593
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:07,619
So embarrassing.

594
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,259
Good night,

595
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:06,302
Do Do-hee.

596
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:08,972
Good night,

597
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:10,974
Jeong Gu-won.

598
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:42,964
Young Master!

599
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,508
Young Master Yi-sun!

600
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:48,970
Your tutor will arrive any minute.
You can't go flower-watching right now.

601
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:50,722
Your father will have a fit if he finds--

602
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:53,516
Everyone will be happy
as long as you keep quiet.

603
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,504
Another dream about when I was human?

604
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:30,136
What's all this noise so early in the…

605
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,726
-morning?
-Good morning.

606
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:40,480
No.

607
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,857
What are you doing so early?

608
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,067
You're a mess.

609
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:46,236
What do you mean?

610
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,863
Am I too pretty in the morning?

611
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:50,198
Yes.

612
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:51,866
No.

613
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,410
It looks like you got into a fight

614
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:56,454
that lasted all night.

615
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:58,331
I hadn't slept so well in forever.

616
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:00,083
I woke up because I was so hungry.

617
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,251
Want some?

618
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:02,710
No thanks.

619
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:05,421
A cup of pour-over coffee,
and I'm good to go.

620
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:06,548
Pour-over coffee?

621
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:08,716
I don't have that.
And we don't have the time.

622
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,135
How can you not have it?

623
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,804
Also, why wouldn't we have the time?
It's the weekend.

624
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:13,930
We have to find the culprit.

625
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:14,889
I don't want to.

626
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,641
The wedding was way too hectic.

627
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:18,643
I insist on taking it easy today.

628
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:20,812
But we're busy with work during the week.

629
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:23,857
What was his name again?

630
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,651
Ju Seok-hoon or whatever he's called.
He's digging into Mr. Cha, isn't he?

631
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:29,696
It'd be faster to dig into a living person
than a dead person.

632
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:31,448
A living person like who?

633
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,283
We don't even know
what he really looks like.

634
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:34,617
We'll find the person behind all this.

635
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:37,287
The real culprit behind the disguised one.

636
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,289
I have a suspect.

637
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:41,082
Who?

638
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,669
Noh Suk-min's son, Noh Do-gyeong.

639
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:04,522
That's enough, Do-gyeong.

640
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:07,984
Stop it. He's tapping out.

641
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:09,235
Let go! Hey!

642
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:12,071
I said that's enough!

643
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,323
Get him off!

644
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:14,991
-What's with you?
-Stop!

645
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:19,078
Let go right now.

646
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:22,415
Are you okay?

647
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,626
Open your eyes.

648
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:27,045
Hey, what the hell?

649
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:30,548
Stop pretending.

650
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:32,800
You're not going to die.

651
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:39,724
How much longer?

652
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,476
I'm coming out!

653
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,440
Okay. I'm ready.

654
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:52,278
No, you're not.

655
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:54,030
Feeling too famous again?

656
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:57,116
We have to cover our faces
if we want to tail him.

657
00:58:58,159 --> 00:58:59,744
You stand out too much.

658
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:01,704
You're practically begging for attention.

659
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:20,181
Hey, why here of all places?

660
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:42,161
What's with you these days?

661
00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:44,455
You might kill someone at this rate.

662
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,171
Come back when you're ready.

663
00:59:58,344 --> 01:00:02,015
So what if I kill someone?

664
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:29,250
Let's go.

665
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:32,795
Hurry up.

666
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:38,259
If we teleport now, we'll end up
in the back seat or the trunk of his car.

667
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:51,689
Please keep a distance.

668
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:09,666
He's quite wary.

669
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,417
No, we're just sloppy.

670
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:14,545
-And my presence is too noticeable--
-Let's wait here for a bit.

671
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:22,136
Where are you going?

672
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:24,097
Let me go grab an espresso real quick.

673
01:01:25,264 --> 01:01:26,474
Don't be ridiculous.

674
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:29,477
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

675
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:33,231
Let's go.

676
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:53,251
He parks his car, then takes the subway?

677
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:55,086
Something's definitely fishy.

678
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:57,296
He really can't stay in one place, can he?

679
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:00,007
Where's mine?

680
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,852
Could the subway station
be their rendezvous point?

681
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:12,937
With the disguised culprit.

682
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:27,660
Another closed room?

683
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,162
You're obsessed, aren't you?

684
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:30,496
Hold on.

685
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,956
Keep this for me.

686
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:33,249
I'll have another later.

687
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:50,808
A storage locker?

688
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:06,449
He does seem extremely wary.

689
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:15,333
Let's go.

690
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:30,932
What the…

691
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:03,673
"Both parties shall cooperate
to achieve their goals."

692
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:26,547
My powers flickered.

693
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:28,382
You're clearly the problem here.

694
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:30,509
If anyone has a problem, it's you.
Don't blame me.

695
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:31,510
Is this how marriage is?

696
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,804
Not like you ever could,
but you should never get married.

697
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:34,722
Don't jinx it!

698
01:05:34,805 --> 01:05:36,849
-Who is this?
-Mr. Who, aren't you coming back in?

699
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,267
Forget it.
You're the one who kicked me out.

700
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:39,936
He ran out after just one day?

701
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:42,772
I find you very suspicious, Mr. Jeong.

702
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:44,440
You're not human, are you?

703
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:45,775
What if Ju Seok-hoon gets up to something?

704
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:48,402
Nothing could possibly stop the truth
from coming out.

705
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:49,820
You should always be careful.

706
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:51,781
Anyone can have a bad day.

707
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:04,460
