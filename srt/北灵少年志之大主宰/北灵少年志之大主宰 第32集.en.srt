00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,120
Let go of my grandpa.

3
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,950
And let go of Li Xuantong.

4
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:29,920
I’ll marry you.

5
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,000
Luo Li.

6
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:31,710
Li Xuantong.

7
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:33,240
You can go.

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,000
Xue Lingzi.

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,360
As long as you marry me,

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,590
I can promise you anything.

11
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:41,750
Luo Li.

12
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:44,910
Brother.

13
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,630
You must stay alive

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,150
before you do anything.

15
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,400
I’ll wait until you come to save me.

16
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:59,740
The Great Ruler

17
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,620
Episode 32

18
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:48,270
You can have a try.

19
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,000
What do you want me to do?

20
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,160
A simple mission.

21
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,440
Kill Mu Chen.

22
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,190
You’re powerful.

23
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,720
But you need my help

24
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,670
to kill Mu Chen.

25
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,360
Seems like

26
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,800
you really need capable hands.

27
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,360
No-Face Taoist,

28
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,960
He Yao and the Black Dragon.

29
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,910
My powerless subordinates

30
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,110
were killed,

31
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,440
mostly because of you.

32
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,000
Liu Mubai.

33
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,440
I keep you alive for mercy’s sake.

34
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,270
But you still talk back!

35
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,040
Do you really think I don’t dare to kill you?

36
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,880
In fact,

37
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,270
I thought you were dead.

38
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,070
Want to know how I found you?

39
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,230
How did you find me?

40
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,110
That day,

41
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:41,270
Mu Chen summoned Sumeru Pillar

42
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,920
in White Horse City.

43
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,159
The remaining power on you

44
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,320
reacted to it.

45
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,159
It led Godfather to you.

46
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,760
You married Miss Tang.

47
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,830
I didn’t mean to disturb you.

48
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,670
But Mu Chen!

49
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,480
He fought against us

50
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,350
again and again!

51
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,390
Then we had to find you.

52
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,110
If it weren’t for him,

53
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,760
you and Miss Tang

54
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,760
could have lived in seclusion

55
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,110
as an ordinary couple

56
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,440
and enjoyed the life.

57
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,110
Without Mu Chen,

58
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,880
nothing would have happened.

59
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,440
Yes!

60
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,480
Nothing will come to an end,

61
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,510
unless Mu Chen dies.

62
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,920
Kill him!

63
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,110
I want you to promise me one thing.

64
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,600
If you do,

65
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,040
I’ll help you.

66
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,110
What is it?

67
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,790
After I kill Mu Chen for you,

68
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,760
don’t come to me again.

69
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,480
I don’t want to see you anymore.

70
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,159
Okay.

71
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,350
I promise you.

72
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,350
After killing Mu Chen,

73
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,070
you can go wherever you want.

74
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,600
I’ll ask Qingxuan to help you.

75
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,880
It’s for you.

76
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,110
What are you doing?

77
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,510
Testing.

78
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,390
Where is Mu Chen now?

79
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,480
Land of Beasts.

80
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,200
Land of Beasts?

81
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:06,600
Are you sure?

82
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,110
Of course.

83
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,160
I’m quite familiar

84
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,600
with that place.

85
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,510
And I have an old friend there.

86
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:06,950
Jiuyou.

87
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:07,920
Jiuyou.

88
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,440
Wake up, Jiuyou!

89
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:10,510
What’s wrong?

90
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,600
Someone is over there.

91
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,760
Someone?

92
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,920
A girl in blue?

93
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,320
Maybe you are wrong?

94
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,159
How come?

95
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,159
In such a damn place,

96
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,270
I’ve never seen anything alive,

97
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,550
expect worms.

98
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,790
How could there be a girl?

99
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,350
Good question.

100
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,920
I don’t know, either.

101
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,000
I just saw her over there.

102
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,440
Where are you going?

103
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,790
Let’s split up.

104
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,200
Wait.

105
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,550
Who are you?

106
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,830
Don’t be scared.

107
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,760
I won’t hurt you.

108
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,510
What’s your name?

109
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,820
[Man Tuluo  Magic Flower of God of Heaven]

110
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,320
Man Tuluo.

111
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,830
Man Tuluo?

112
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,640
Why are you here?

113
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,880
I’m… I’m lost.

114
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:39,880
Bai Tong.

115
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,320
Don’t approach her.

116
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:43,549
But…

117
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,840
She said she was lost.

118
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,230
Land of Beasts is

119
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,960
at least hundreds of miles large.

120
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,230
Do you really believe she’s lost?

121
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,110
You’re lost?

122
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,080
Where do you live?

123
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,000
Stop crying.

124
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,550
Bai Tong.

125
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,280
She’s still crying! What do we do?

126
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,030
Miss.

127
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,150
Miss.

128
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,350
Stop crying!

129
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,550
Tell me.

130
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,550
Where do you live?

131
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,790
I’m… I’m lost.

132
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,960
Do you really believe

133
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,350
she’s an ordinary girl?

134
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,520
I don’t.

135
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,080
She cried so sadly

136
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,840
and now she’s so happy!

137
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,400
She can’t be an ordinary girl.

138
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:10,790
You know what?

139
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,640
When I was little,

140
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,710
my father always kicked me out of town.

141
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,960
In the most dangerous place.

142
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,470
I had no partners

143
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,880
or friends.

144
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,440
I could do nothing, but practice.

145
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,110
So…

146
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,280
Seeing her smiling happily,

147
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,110
I kind of envy her.

148
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,440
However dangerous it was,

149
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,200
it could be better than the Land of Beasts.

150
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,230
Look!

151
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,080
Man Tuluo.

152
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,000
Can you tell us

153
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
where you live?

154
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,200
We can’t take you back

155
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,400
until you tell us.

156
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,110
She’s so weird.

157
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,230
We better not follow her.

158
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,440
That’s why

159
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,590
we should follow her.

160
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,080
What if

161
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,840
she has something to do with Mu Chen?

162
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,960
Luo Li!

163
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,470
Grandpa Tianlong.

164
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,840
You pretended so well.

165
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,790
What’s worse,

166
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,000
my uncle,

167
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,080
and the brother of my grandpa

168
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,440
both betrayed us.

169
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,470
Luo Li.

170
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,280
Luo Li.

171
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,200
Luo Li.

172
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,400
You’re wrong.

173
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,470
I’m considering for our clan.

174
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,230
Right?

175
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,760
When you marry him,

176
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,440
both of our clans will be benefited.

177
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,910
That wasn’t

178
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,200
what you told me yesterday.

179
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,110
You told me

180
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,640
Xue Lingzi is an evil guy

181
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,520
and I shouldn’t marry him.

182
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,880
Luo Li. Luo Li.

183
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,350
When did I say that?

184
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,350
Elder Xiu.

185
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,640
You gave in to Xue Lingzi so quickly?

186
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,000
Luo Li.

187
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,670
Don’t push it.

188
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,080
You don’t call the shots

189
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,710
in this condition.

190
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,080
Luo Xiu!

191
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,760
Luo Li is my fiancée.

192
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,030
I asked you to persuade her.

193
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,840
But don’t you think

194
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,150
you’re too rude?

195
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,320
Losers!

196
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,350
Get out.

197
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,200
Okay. Okay.

198
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,320
Let’s go.

199
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,150
Luo Li.

200
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,440
You promised to marry me.

201
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,440
Why are you going back on your word?

202
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,200
You sent them,

203
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,670
just to tell me

204
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,400
you’re the leader of Luo God Clan,

205
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:48,590
didn’t you?

206
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,550
Don’t get me wrong.

207
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,150
They came to persuade you

208
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,520
as your seniors,

209
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,520
just for your own good.

210
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,470
Luo Xiu is always a coward.

211
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,470
I don’t feel strange.

212
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,640
But Luo Tianlong is close to my grandpa.

213
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,910
How did you buy him over?

214
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,640
Everyone wants

215
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,790
to be the leader.

216
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,840
Luo Tianlong

217
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,670
looks honest and kind,

218
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,760
but has a lot of evil plans.

219
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,840
He told your clansmen

220
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,910
that you love a human.

221
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,590
Luo Li.

222
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,470
In front of the Luo River,

223
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,110
you promised to marry me.

224
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,110
Now,

225
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,350
you are not backing out, are you?

226
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,000
Don’t you want to save your grandpa?

227
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,590
Spiteful man!

228
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,670
Spiteful?

229
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,790
I am!

230
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,840
But if I didn’t do this,

231
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,840
you wouldn’t have even noticed me.

232
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,350
As the Saintess of Luo God Clan,

233
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,910
how would you like a man like me?

234
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,640
But so what?

235
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,910
I don’t care how you think of me.

236
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,590
I just want to grow stronger.

237
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,590
To get more power,

238
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,470
I’d rather work for the Evil Deity.

239
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,590
For my clansmen,

240
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,470
I must grow stronger.

241
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,760
I swore to

242
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:40,320
make my clan among the top of God Clans

243
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,960
and be always respected.

244
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,710
You know what?

245
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
I had planned

246
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,470
to kill all your clansmen

247
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,080
after I took the clan down.

248
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,880
Unexpectedly, I fell in love with you.

249
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,590
Luo Li.

250
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,910
As long as you marry me,

251
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:12,790
I promise

252
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,550
I won’t hurt your clansmen.

253
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,790
I’ll keep my word.

254
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,030
Mu Chen.

255
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:39,710
Qian’er?

256
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,550
Mu Chen.

257
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,470
Mu Chen.

258
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,000
Qian’er.

259
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,400
What happened to you?

260
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,710
Tell me!

261
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,080
Mu Chen…

262
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,670
Qian’er!

263
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,790
Qian’er!

264
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,200
Qian’er!

265
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:27,670
Qian’er.

266
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,440
What happened to you?

267
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,710
I’m fine.

268
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,200
How can you be fine?

269
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,840
I just felt your pulse.

270
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,710
You’ve lost all your power.

271
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,590
It’s a miracle that you’re still alive.

272
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,840
And you think you’re fine?

273
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,280
Qian’er.

274
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,400
Tell me.

275
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,960
What happened?

276
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,150
Where’s Mu Chen?

277
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,200
Where is he?

278
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,150
I have something to tell him.

279
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,960
He’s gone to the Land of Beasts.

280
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,150
Land of Beasts?

281
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,440
He wants to find

282
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,590
Phoenix Heritage for Jiuyou.

283
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:07,190
I’m going to find them.

284
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,430
Qian’er.

285
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,230
You’re so weak.

286
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,640
Why do you rush to find Mu Chen?

287
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,950
I have a reason.

288
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,640
When you ran back,

289
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,640
you passed out.

290
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,880
Not to mention going to the Land of Beasts.

291
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:20,310
Besides,

292
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,470
do you even know where it is?

293
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,589
Until you are better,

294
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,950
we can’t  let you leave.

295
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:33,710
Okay.

296
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:44,880
Luo Li.

297
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,760
I’m glad you came to me.

298
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:47,680
What do you want?

299
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,520
I just want to tell you.

300
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,280
I will marry you.

301
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,230
Won’t you regret?

302
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,520
You shall pick the date.

303
00:17:59,280 --> 00:17:59,880
But…

304
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,760
don’t forget your promise.

305
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,590
Okay.

306
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:03,680
Okay!

307
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,640
As long as you marry me,

308
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,880
I’ll do whatever you want.

309
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,430
By the way,

310
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,190
I hear

311
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,880
the Human Clan has a beatifying cream.

312
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,280
It’s said to have great effect.

313
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,640
I want to try it before the wedding.

314
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,350
It’s the prescription.

315
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,950
Why are there power drugs

316
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,830
in the prescription for beautifying?

317
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,430
We’re not humans.

318
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,640
It’s normal to have something

319
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,520
to nourish our power.

320
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,110
If you feel worried,

321
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,680
get rid of those drugs.

322
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,590
Why will I feel worried?

323
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,680
Whatever you want,

324
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,310
I’ll get it for you,

325
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,680
even the stars!

326
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,470
I’ll have it done immediately.

327
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,830
I’ll fill the prescription

328
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,590
in the shortest time.

329
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,230
Come in.

330
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,070
Put it there.

331
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,640
Luo Li.

332
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,470
Brother?

333
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,110
Why do you come?

334
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,950
I come to rescue you.

335
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,280
We can run out of Luo City

336
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,190
in the darkness.

337
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,800
If I leave,

338
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,400
my clansmen

339
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,520
will have consequences.

340
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,280
Clansmen?

341
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,350
They were too cowardly

342
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,000
and they insisted on

343
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,800
giving you to Xue God Clan.

344
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,280
What about my grandpa?

345
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,430
They have my grandpa.

346
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,680
If I leave,

347
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,470
Xue Lingzi won’t let him go.

348
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,280
Luo Li.

349
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,520
Xue Lingzi got your grandpa

350
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,000
just to get you bite the hook.

351
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,830
You can’t help even if you stay.

352
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,280
You’re just in time.

353
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,040
Tomorrow afternoon,

354
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,950
I’ll take Xue Lingzi away

355
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,040
and you can save my grandpa.

356
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,230
But…

357
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,280
As long as you save my grandpa,

358
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,110
I can get away.

359
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,520
If you fail,

360
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,110
I’ll save you,

361
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,590
whatever it takes.

362
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,920
Don’t worry.

363
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,590
Brother.

364
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,760
They keep a close eye on me.

365
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,520
They’ll suspect if you stay too long.

366
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,280
Go!

367
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:10,800
Do protect yourself.

368
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,160
I will!

369
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,820
[Land of Beasts]

370
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,310
Qian’er?

371
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,040
Saintess.

372
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,830
This is everything for the beautifying cream.

373
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,590
Leader asked me to give it to you.

374
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:18,920
Leave me.

375
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:19,590
Aye.

376
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:44,880
Servant!

377
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:47,800
Luo Li.

378
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,920
You asked to see me?

379
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,110
Is the wedding ready?

380
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,190
Everything is ready.

381
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,470
In a couple of days,

382
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,230
on a lucky day,

383
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,160
you’ll be my wife.

384
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,310
We haven’t had the wedding yet.

385
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,110
Show some respect.

386
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,160
Okay.

387
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,590
I respect you.

388
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,830
I asked to see you,

389
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,800
because I have something to tell you.

390
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,070
Go ahead.

391
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,280
According to our rule,

392
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,430
before the wedding,

393
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,880
we must sacrifice in front of Luo River,

394
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,590
paying tribute to ancestors.

395
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,590
This is our tradition.

396
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,230
I don’t make it up.

397
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,280
If you don’t believe me, ask Luo Tianlong.

398
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,160
I’m not suspecting you.

399
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:48,110
But the wedding is around the corner.

400
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,560
We don’t have time for it.

401
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,430
It will do at anytime

402
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,230
before the wedding.

403
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,110
Okay.

404
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:58,920
Since so,

405
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:00,880
today it is.

406
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,640
We perform the ritual today.

407
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,070
What do you think?

408
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,430
Okay.

409
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,800
I’ll get it prepared.

410
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,070
Leader.

411
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,040
Xuantong?

412
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,070
Luo Li asked me to save you.

413
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,350
Where is she?

414
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,110
It’s too dangerous to talk here.

415
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,110
Luo Li…

416
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,160
Where is she now?

417
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,560
Xue Lingzi still has her.

418
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,950
But don’t worry.

419
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,040
As her sworn brother,

420
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,920
I will get her out

421
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,520
even if I have to die.

422
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:50,710
Wait.

423
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,760
You’re weak and alone.

424
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,280
I’ll go with you.

425
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,040
Leader.

426
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,710
You can’t take the risk.

427
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,110
With you around,

428
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,760
Luo God Clan still has the hope.

429
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,950
Luo God Clan

430
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,800
will always have a leader.

431
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,830
But I have

432
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,040
only one granddaughter.

433
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:07,640
Leader.

434
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,800
If I fail to come back

435
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,040
you have to

436
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,190
save Luo Li.

437
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,760
So, you must chill out!

438
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:20,950
Okay.

439
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,430
I’ll be expecting your good news.

440
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,400
Be careful!

441
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:40,190
Leader!

442
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,160
All guards were killed.

443
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,470
Luo Tianhe was taken away.

444
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,350
He’s missing.

445
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,040
Whatever it takes,

446
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,230
find him out!

447
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:48,830
Yes.

448
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:49,680
Remember.

449
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,520
Tell no one about it.

450
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,400
Especially don’t tell Luo Li.

451
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:53,800
Aye!

452
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,230
Understand?

453
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:54,710
Yes.

454
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,520
How far is she going to take us?

455
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:18,880
I don’t know, either.

456
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,190
If she takes us around blindly,

457
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,800
our time will be wasted.

458
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:26,000
We were walking around blindly.

459
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,470
It’s not a problem.

460
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,070
I just want to see

461
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,400
how far she wants to take us.

462
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,430
And…

463
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,350
we don’t need to alert her,

464
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,070
unless she’s with the Evil Deity.

465
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:40,430
Where is she?

466
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,070
Watch out for traps.

467
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,040
Not the vines again?

468
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:52,760
Bai Tong.

469
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,160
What are you dazing at?

470
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,040
Who are you?

471
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,520
You’ve trapped me here for a thousand years.

472
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,070
What else do you want?

473
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:04,470
What’s going on?

474
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,710
It’s a magic circle.

475
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,560
The girl in blue is the core.

476
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,560
Go to hell!

477
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,040
Give Mu Chen back!

478
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,310
Who is the old friend

479
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,280
you mentioned?

480
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,830
Get in and you’ll know.

481
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,110
I think Mu Chen and Jiuyou

482
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,190
have met her.

483
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,110
Interesting!

484
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,350
Interesting!

485
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:53,590
Mu Chen.

486
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:56,280
Liu Mubai.

487
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,920
What are you doing here?

488
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,680
Where are you going?

489
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,710
I know Mu Chen is in the forest.

490
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,800
You want to kill him again?

491
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,830
You shouldn’t have come here.

492
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,000
Go!

493
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,350
I come for you.

494
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,000
I won’t leave,

495
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,590
unless you go with me.

496
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,430
Mubai.

497
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,950
Weren’t we happy in the Liu Territory?

498
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,230
We had simple meals,

499
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,110
and lived a simple life.

500
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,920
That was great.

501
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,520
If we hadn’t experienced that,

502
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,880
it might be good, too.

503
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,710
Leave.

504
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,160
Stop coming to me again.

505
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,640
I don’t need a woman like you,

506
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,950
who doesn’t even have a magic pulse.

507
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:11,590
Okay.

508
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:52,680
Luo Li.

509
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,830
When you agree to marry me,

510
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,280
I really feel happy.

511
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,040
Do you?

512
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,000
Weak as you are,

513
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:20,469
you can’t hurt me at all.

514
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:23,909
Luo Li.

515
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,190
Do you really hate me so much?

516
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,870
I don’t believe you’ll keep your promise.

517
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,630
I want to marry you,

518
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,800
because I truly love you.

519
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:35,600
Why will I go back on my word

520
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,360
to make you unhappy?

521
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,670
If I just want to have you,

522
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,760
why must I take so much trouble?

523
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:56,520
It’s the mark of the Evil Deity.

524
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,630
I accepted this power,

525
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:02,190
not to control the world,

526
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,520
but to be powerful enough to marry you.

527
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:06,950
So, you love me,

528
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,320
by hurting my clansmen,

529
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,520
ruining my hometown

530
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,800
and locking me up?

531
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,080
Your love is so great

532
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,710
and selfless!

533
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,800
Why are you so stubborn?

534
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,230
Don’t be scared.

535
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,950
I just locked your power.

536
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:42,840
I know.

537
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,320
you don’t want to marry me,

538
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,000
because you like someone else.

539
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,000
You want to see Mu Chen, don’t you?

540
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:53,630
I’ll help you.

541
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,150
I hear tomorrow,

542
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,120
our leader is taking his wife out.

543
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:31,870
Yeah.

544
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,120
He said his wife was unhappy

545
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,430
and would show her around her hometown

546
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,800
since she liked it.

547
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:36,630
All right.

548
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,150
Go!

549
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,120
Dudes are going to drink tonight.

550
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,430
Unfortunately, I can’t go.

551
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,470
I’ll leave some for you.

552
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,600
Thank you!

553
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,120
I’m freaked out!

554
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,320
Who the hell are you?

555
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,800
Where were you?

556
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,390
I just…

557
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,870
I just remembered

558
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,150
the way home.

559
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,080
And then,

560
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,230
I passed out here.

561
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,190
But you were just in blue.

562
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,800
Who the hell are you?

563
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,760
I told you.

564
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,230
I just passed out.

565
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,360
I’m not a bad person.

566
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,760
Look!

567
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,120
What’s the power?

568
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,230
Cure.

569
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,470
I can cure all plants.

570
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,670
I was born with this ability.

571
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,840
Did you

572
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,190
eat the larva of moths?

573
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,150
The plants?

574
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,670
They told you about it?

575
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,670
They could show me everything they see

576
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,190
in my mind.

577
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,470
Do you want us

578
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,320
to take you home?

579
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,080
I can’t go home.

580
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,840
And I often pass out for no reason.

581
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,670
I miss my home!

582
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,190
Where do you live?

583
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,630
Yeah.

584
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,190
Where do I live?

585
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,040
Why don’t I remember?

586
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,040
Uh…

587
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,840
Do you know where the ancient wood is?

588
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,600
I do.

589
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,230
But you must promise me.

590
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,710
After I take you there,

591
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:37,320
you must walk me home.

592
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,000
Okay.

593
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,320
We promise you.

594
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,600
Let’s go.

595
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:43,430
Wait.

596
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,910
Do you know Phoenix Heritage?

597
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,670
Phoenix Heritage?

598
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:51,760
You mean

599
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:54,120
the stele on the stump?

600
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,360
Stele?

601
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,670
There is an incomplete stele

602
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,870
on the stump of the ancient tree.

603
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,120
No one understands

604
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,670
the inscriptions on the stele.

605
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,430
I don’t dare to approach it.

606
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,190
Because

607
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,320
whenever I approach it,

608
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,190
I feel burning over me.

609
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,470
That’s what we want, I guess.
