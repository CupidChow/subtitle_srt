1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available.]


2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,720
We did it!


3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,030
Jiuyou.


4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,350
Jiuyou?


5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,600
Jiuyou!


6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,360
Jiuyou!


7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,070
Jiuyou!


8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,360
Main forces of the Mu family are taken away.


9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,560
The Capital is now an empty city.


10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,200
We attacked it with all our strength.


11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,000
Instead of taking it down,


12
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,750
we lost a group of soldiers.


13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,520
Amazing.


14
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,000
Master.


15
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,840
I never expect there to be


16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,950
City Protection Circle in the Capital.


17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,120
Please give me more time.


18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,160
What makes me curious is that


19
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,400
people in Mu Territory seemed to be prepared


20
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,870
and they knew we would come.


21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,039
But why?


22
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,270
Mr. Liu.


23
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,830
Haven’t you found your son yet?


24
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:29,870
Not yet.


25
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,630
We must take the Capital down


26
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,720
by this time tomorrow.


27
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,550
Master.


28
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,950
A lot of war magicians


29
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:45,630
were hurt. I’m afraid


30
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,680
they’re too weak to make the Great Magic tomorrow.


31
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,590
That’s


32
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,039
not a problem.


33
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,590
Greetings, Ruler.


34
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,750
This is a pill


35
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,270
I made with my power.


36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,470
Dissolve them in water


37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,630
and drink it.


38
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,720
Master.


39
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,550
What’s going on?


40
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,240
It’s Power of Whisper.


41
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,880
From my master’s power.


42
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,440
Compared to him,


43
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,360
I can only give them


44
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,000
very little power.


45
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,600
Isn’t your master


46
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,270
Lord Black Dragon?


47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
He’s at most my colleague.


48
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,240
My master…


49
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,720
Even Lord Black Dragon


50
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,390
has to kowtow to him.


51
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,520
When we get a chance,


52
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,630
I’ll introduce you to him.


53
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:08,740
The Great Ruler


54
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,700
Episode 10


55
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,270
Just save your


56
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,550
humble power.


57
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,200
Sorry.


58
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,350
I was a burden to you.


59
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,550
Those guys from Liu Territory were too arrogant.


60
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,950
I didn’t like them.


61
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,390
Jiuyou.


62
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,600
I’m not going to let you die.


63
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,350
Sure.


64
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
If I die,


65
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,640
you die, too.


66
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,270
How is the battle?


67
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,600
They stopped attacking us, I think.


68
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,000
Their war magicians


69
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,070
are worn out.


70
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,670
Thanks to you.


71
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,000
It’s not a time to celebrate.


72
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,510
They won’t stop.


73
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,000
They won’t.


74
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,720
I just wonder


75
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,640
if we can make it tomorrow.


76
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,070
Are humans all like you?


77
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,270
You don’t want to die.


78
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,160
But you still stay.


79
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,110
There’s something


80
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,830
I must do.


81
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,830
It’s my duty.


82
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,390
Let me ask you a question.


83
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,880
You like Luo Li, right?


84
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,230
In our clan,


85
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,880
we stay with the one we like


86
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,230
unless we die.


87
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,600
But why did you leave


88
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,760
when you liked someone?


89
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,720
You like her that much.


90
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,600
Why did you let her go?


91
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,000
I like Luo Li.


92
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,600
So, I can’t get her hurt.


93
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,070
I like my hometown, too.


94
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,550
I like everything here.


95
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,880
Everything.


96
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,550
So, I can’t watch my city


97
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,920
being invaded by Liu Territory.


98
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,790
I still don’t understand.


99
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,350
What’s the difference


100
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,040
between them?


101
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,270
I thought


102
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,320
you would have said something impressive.


103
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,440
Again, rhetoric!


104
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,320
All you said


105
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,790
is just like nothing.


106
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,550
All right.


107
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,640
Since they stopped,


108
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,950
let’s get some rest.


109
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,070
Mom.


110
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,040
I’ve never met you.


111
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,830
But I miss you, as father does.


112
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,270
I don’t know how long I can last.


113
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,200
I also don’t know


114
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,390
if I can see you again.


115
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,400
It’s coming.


116
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,350
Dad!


117
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,320
I’ve tried my best.


118
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,670
Ruler.


119
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,000
Mu Territory is just ahead.


120
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,150
It seems to be okay.


121
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,320
Mr. Mu.


122
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,960
This is all I can help.


123
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,320
My father is bewitched, too.


124
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,910
I’ll go back and persuade him.


125
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,470
See you, then.


126
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,200
Wait.


127
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,440
If you go back now,


128
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,400
I’m afraid


129
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,200
your father won’t let you go.


130
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,910
Don’t bother to stop me.


131
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,400
We’re in a battle.


132
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,960
I’m an official


133
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:41,960
and son of the ruler of Liu Territory.


134
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,550
If I don’t go back,


135
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,030
I’ll be disloyal and unfilial.


136
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,440
Mubai.


137
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,150
You’re deeply conscious.


138
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,280
If you hadn’t told us the truth,


139
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,550
there would have been severe consequences.


140
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,200
I told you the truth,


141
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,910
because my father really


142
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,200
did something unfair.


143
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,470
When I’m back,


144
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,080
I’m afraid we’ll meet again


145
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,150
in the battle.


146
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,670
Take care, Mr. Mu.


147
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,640
See you.


148
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,080
Disappeared?


149
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,280
Sword cuts!


150
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,280
They were killed with one stroke.


151
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,550
Mr. Liu.


152
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,200
How fragile your camp is?


153
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,960
How could someone sneak in so easily


154
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,200
and kill your guys?


155
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,590
Give my order.


156
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,910
Everybody, launch an attack


157
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,440
at Mu’s Capital.


158
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,320
Yes.


159
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,960
Mu Chen.


160
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,880
You’re the only guard


161
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,440
for your capital?


162
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,280
Exactly.


163
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,880
Good.


164
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,520
Seems like you’re brave enough.


165
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,440
As your uncle,


166
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,320
I won’t hurt you


167
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,470
if you surrender.


168
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,790
Mr. Liu.


169
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,000
Stop joking.


170
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,440
I’m alone,


171
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,320
but I defended the city for two days.


172
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,960
When my father comes back,


173
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,760
I’ll see what you get.


174
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,030
You should surrender.


175
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,230
Mr. Liu.


176
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,280
Mu Chen.


177
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,590
My army is attacking your capital soon.


178
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,150
Even if your father comes back,


179
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,520
what can he do?


180
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,200
You really have a partner.


181
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,440
Luo Li!


182
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,790
Why are you back?


183
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,710
I’ll sort you out later.


184
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,760
Who else do you have? Come out.


185
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,760
Luo God Sword?


186
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,200
You killed my war magicians?


187
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,400
So what?


188
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,910
Catch them!


189
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,030
Mr. Mu.


190
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,590
Dad.


191
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,440
Mu Feng.


192
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,280
You…


193
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,550
Liu Qingtian.


194
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,670
You betrayed us and worked for the evil.


195
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,470
Shame on you!


196
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,840
-Shu Zhang.
-General Shu.


197
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,790
Let no one leave!


198
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,280
Go!


199
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:18,880
Go!


200
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,280
Luo Li!


201
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,350
Go!


202
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,200
Luo Li!


203
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,110
Mu Chen!


204
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:39,960
Don’t go!


205
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,760
Luo Li!


206
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,710
Qingshan!


207
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,400
Qian’er!


208
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,470
Take Mu Chen away!


209
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,400
Luo Li!


210
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,470
Ruler, go!


211
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:06,200
Mo, let’s go! Or no one can leave!


212
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,110
Mr. Mo, leave without me!


213
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,350
Retreat!


214
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,880
Luo Li!


215
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,230
Go!


216
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,030
Hurry!


217
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,960
Luo Li!


218
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,520
Go!


219
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:49,590
Mu.


220
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,200
How is Mu Chen?


221
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,550
He just used up his power.


222
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,910
He’ll be fine in a couple of days.


223
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,520
He was alone.


224
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,790
But he managed to defend the city for two days.


225
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,200
No people were hurt.


226
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,000
You or I


227
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:06,880
may not manage to do that.


228
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,950
This is not only about


229
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,280
having great power.


230
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,349
Mo.


231
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,800
I’m not a good father.


232
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,950
If my son is in danger,


233
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,349
how can I explain to his mom?


234
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:27,000
Mu.


235
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,880
Don’t blame yourself.


236
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,230
It’s not your fault.


237
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,590
Then,


238
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,190
what are you going to do?


239
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,430
I’ll protect our people first.


240
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,160
Then,


241
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,760
protect the cities.


242
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,000
Don’t be nervous.


243
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,190
I’m right.


244
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,000
You’re the Goddess of Luo God Clan.


245
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,880
It’s Power-dissipating Spell.


246
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,350
It may hurt a little.


247
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,000
But it’ll draw out all your power


248
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,310
and make it into Power-collection Pills.


249
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,590
If I give them to my master,


250
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,760
I guess he’ll be happy.


251
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,880
Father.


252
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,190
Do you still regard me as your father?


253
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,800
Do you still remember your family?


254
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,070
You colluded with enemies and you shall be killed


255
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,520
according to the military law.


256
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,190
Father.


257
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,830
We made an alliance with Mu Territory.


258
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,160
But you betrayed it.


259
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:40,710
Later,


260
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,000
how will people say about us?


261
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,710
Besides, No-face Taoist isn’t a good guy.


262
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,230
I think you know


263
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,190
we share a common lot.


264
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,520
I did that,


265
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,350
for the good of our territory.


266
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,830
I feel no qualms.


267
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,400
Say that again.


268
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,920
I feel no qualms!


269
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:58,710
You!


270
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,070
Bad son!


271
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,110
Damn you!


272
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,110
Somebody!


273
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,110
Take him away and lock him up


274
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,590
so that he can reflect on himself.


275
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,470
Yes.


276
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,160
Young Master.


277
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:20,920
Sorry.


278
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,680
It took so long to take the Capital down,


279
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,310
and Mu Feng rushed back to us.


280
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,640
All thanks to your son.


281
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,070
The army is ruled with laws.


282
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:48,040
I don’t think you’re strict enough.


283
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,190
My son is too young


284
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,800
and he’s impetuous.


285
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,350
Please give him


286
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,310
another chance.


287
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,190
I promise you.


288
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,310
Within one month,


289
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,950
we will take down Mu Territory.


290
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,230
OK.


291
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,880
Hope you can


292
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,640
keep your promise.


293
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:09,920
Xiong Territory was invaded, too.


294
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,070
If Liu Qingtian had


295
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,680
fought us in a fair way,


296
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,800
we wouldn’t have lost.


297
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,160
We sent invitation to all territories.


298
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,830
Did any of them reply?


299
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,640
No.


300
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,400
Not even Tang Territory?


301
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,230
They used to


302
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,470
get on with us.


303
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,520
But they have an engagement with Liu Territory.


304
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,920
I know Mr. Tang for years.


305
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,590
And I know what a guy he is.


306
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,430
But…


307
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,400
Liu Territory is rather powerful.


308
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,640
It’s possible that


309
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,280
he wants to play safe.


310
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,640
It’s human nature


311
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,040
to play safe.


312
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,470
It gives no ground for blame.


313
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,880
Tang.


314
00:20:59,190 --> 00:20:59,950
Mu.


315
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,350
I have something to ask you.


316
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,950
Mubai.


317
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,430
It’s been days.


318
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,280
How can you survive without eating anything?


319
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,710
These are your favorites.


320
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,350
What?


321
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,640
Still angry with me?


322
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,000
Mubai.


323
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,880
Today,


324
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,000
Mr. Tang visited me with Qian’er.


325
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,160
He wants you to get married


326
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,430
as soon as you can.


327
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,070
He came at this time.


328
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,950
Our territory


329
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,160
must be invincible.


330
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:45,310
We’ve taken down half of Mu Territory.


331
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,590
After that,


332
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,760
dominating Beiling is just a matter of time.


333
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,800
After you take down Mu Territory,


334
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,640
which one are you going to destroy next,


335
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,680
Hong Territory or Lie Territory?


336
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,830
Isn’t it a good thing


337
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,350
if we can dominate Beiling?


338
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,160
All my career


339
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,680
will be yours.


340
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,520
That’s career made by betraying.


341
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,430
I’d rather not have it.


342
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,000
Mubai.


343
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,310
Which matters more,


344
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,040
reputation or life?


345
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,110
Why can’t you understand?


346
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:20,880
Father.


347
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,520
Are you so scared of the Black Dragon?


348
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,040
There’s more behind it


349
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,000
than the Black Dragon.


350
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,590
Mubai.


351
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:37,830
I’m begging you.


352
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,280
Stop being stubborn.


353
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,760
If you offend the man behind Black Dragon,


354
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,760
we will die,


355
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,310
and even our whole territory


356
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,040
will be doomed.


357
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,350
Father.


358
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,040
Tell me.


359
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,760
Was my uncle really killed by Mo Xingtian?


360
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,680
Are you suspecting me?


361
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,350
What about Liu Yang?


362
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,310
What if he knows


363
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,070
you work with the murderer?


364
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,310
You shall let no one know it.


365
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,350
Mubai.


366
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,070
Help me.


367
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,000
If I don’t,


368
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,350
will our territory be destroyed?


369
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,230
By now,


370
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,310
I still can’t agree with you.


371
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,190
But anyway, I’m the Young Master


372
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,190
and your son.


373
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,520
Tang.


374
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,070
Liu.


375
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,280
Sorry to keep you waiting.


376
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,280
Mubai.


377
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,040
Hurry.


378
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,470
Say hello.


379
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,710
Greetings, Mr. Tang.


380
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,070
Stand up.


381
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,230
Mubai.


382
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,310
Your father told you, right?


383
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,830
What do you think?


384
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,520
You call the shots, Mr. Tang.


385
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,830
Then what should you call me?


386
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,800
Father.


387
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,110
Good.


388
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,070
Good!


389
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,040
Liu.


390
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:36,950
Then


391
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,520
we’ve got a lot to do.


392
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Congratulations.


393
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,880
Your children get married.


394
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,640
I’ll definitely come to the wedding.


395
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,800
Sure.


396
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,070
Mubai.


397
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,430
Hurry.


398
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,160
Say hello.


399
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:05,640
Mubai.


400
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,560
Hello. Master.


401
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,760
Seems like


402
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,950
he’s changed his mind.


403
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,400
Yes.


404
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,680
Master.


405
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,350
My son


406
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,800
was too impetuous


407
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,280
and made too much trouble.


408
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,710
But he won’t do it ever again.


409
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,470
Please don’t


410
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,160
blame him.


411
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,640
A young man


412
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,950
is always less considerate


413
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,070
I’m glad he changed his mind.


414
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,280
Yes.


415
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:49,950
Mr. Tang.


416
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,470
I hear Qian’er has come, too.


417
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,830
Yes, she has.


418
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,800
Mubai.


419
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,110
I…


420
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,800
I hear


421
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,640
your father locked you up.


422
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,190
I was worried,


423
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,560
so, I came to check on you.


424
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,520
Your father asked us to get married.


425
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:32,880
Do you know that?


426
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,110
Anyway,


427
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,190
we’re getting married.


428
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,110
But Mubai.


429
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,280
What about Mu Territory?


430
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,950
Your father has worked with Dragon Clan


431
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,680
and taken over the Capital.


432
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,920
They’ll attack other cities.


433
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,000
Uh…


434
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,830
Mu Territory is going to be destroyed.


435
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,590
And now,


436
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,230
my father wants to attack them


437
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,400
with your father.


438
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,950
We must do something


439
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,470
to stop them.


440
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,040
What can we do?


441
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,590
If we do nothing,


442
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,400
what can Mr. Mu survive? And Mu Chen.


443
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,880
How can he survive?


444
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,920
As the Young Master of Liu Territory,


445
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,710
I must consider for our own interests.


446
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,070
In a battle,


447
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,470
there’s no right or wrong,


448
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,800
but only sides to take.


449
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,280
What’s wrong with you, Mubai?


450
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,800
Did anything happen?


451
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,230
Nothing.


452
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,190
But you didn’t think so before.


453
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,350
It’s been only a couple of days.


454
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,350
Why have you changed?


455
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:46,760
Qian’er.


456
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,190
Leave.


457
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,760
I don’t want to see you now.


458
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:16,880
Dad!


459
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,760
Chen.


460
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,350
You’ve recovered well.


461
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,430
I just lost my power.


462
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,190
Dad.


463
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:25,800
I’m fine.


464
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,230
How about Luo Li?


465
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,110
She’s the Goddess of Luo God Clan


466
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,160
and she’s special.


467
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:35,430
I don’t think Liu Qingtian will offend her clan.


468
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:38,350
So, she must be safe.


469
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,830
Don’t worry.


470
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,710
I’ll let you know when I get any news.


471
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,160
How is the battle now?


472
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,230
Last night,


473
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:52,950
we lost Feng City.


474
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,950
How much have we lost?


475
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,310
Including Feng City,


476
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,470
half of our territory


477
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,040
has been taken over by Liu Territory.


478
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,190
If the casualties are small,


479
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,760
it’s a good thing for us.


480
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,880
Be specific.


481
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,280
It’s easy to take over cities, but hard to defend them.


482
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,680
Liu Territory took over the cities.


483
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,190
It means they have to defend them.


484
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,430
All we have to do is to block their supporting troops,


485
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,160
and let them waste more power.


486
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,430
We’ll get more power then.


487
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,160
When it’s time to strike,


488
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,710
we can take back the cities one by one.


489
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,800
It’s great


490
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,190
when you can think of it.


491
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,710
You’re right.


492
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,280
In a battle,


493
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,590
it matters who lasts longer.


494
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,880
But we can’t last too long,


495
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,760
just as Liu Qingtian.


496
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,310
Dragon Clan helps him.


497
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,230
By harassing only,


498
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,920
we may not get back the lost cities.


499
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,800
As time goes by,


500
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,470
we may lose people’s support.


501
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,590
Dad.


502
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,190
Can Devil-dissipating Circle


503
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,350
restrain the Black Dragon?


504
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,560
I think so.


505
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,800
It’s good then.


506
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,190
Why are you worried?


507
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,520
Devil-dissipating Circle works


508
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:06,680
to restrain the evil power of the Evil Deity.


509
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,710
You mean?


510
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,680
You think the Black Dragon
colluded with the Evil Deity?


511
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:14,920
The Evil Deity appears with Nine Eyes.


512
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:17,110
The Lake of Dragon looks exactly like an eye.


513
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,350
And


514
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,560
so many weird things happened.


515
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:26,190
Your mom said


516
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,190
the Evil Deity


517
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,280
was not only powerful.


518
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,280
What was worse,


519
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,230
he could transfer his power to others.


520
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,590
When someone gets his power,


521
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:40,950
he’ll be greatly enhanced.


522
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,160
But he’ll


523
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,880
gradually lose his mind,


524
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,560
until he becomes Evil Deity’s puppet.


525
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:49,760
Dad.


526
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,520
Think positively.


527
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,560
Even if the Black Dragon colludes with the Evil Deity,


528
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,560
we can then use


529
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,760
Devil-dissipating Circle.


530
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,000
At least,


531
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,190
it helps with the urgency.


532
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,830
You sound optimistic.


533
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,710
But


534
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,520
Liu Qingtian is stationed in our capital.


535
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,560
And the center of the circle


536
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,950
is at there, too.


537
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,040
If we want to start the circle,


538
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,760
we have a problem.


539
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,110
Dad.


540
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,310
I want to sneak to the Capital


541
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,560
and start the circle.


542
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,280
No way.


543
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,830
Way too dangerous.


544
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,400
I’ll go, if we have to.


545
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,920
You’re the commander.


546
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,160
How can you take the risk?


547
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,950
I know everything in the Capital.


548
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,520
And I know much about circles.


549
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,760
I’m the best candidate.


550
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:34,680
Dad.


551
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:35,800
Trust me.


552
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,590
I won’t risk my life.


553
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,350
OK.


554
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,590
Ruler.


555
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:50,710
Our team for army provisions was attacked.


556
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,560
Half of the soldiers died.


557
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,680
Go give my order.


558
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:53,800
From now on,


559
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,400
double the number


560
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,590
for transferring teams.


561
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,230
But,


562
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,880
we don’t have enough guards.


563
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,110
Do as you’re told.


564
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,470
Rear service must be guaranteed.


565
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,560
Yes.


566
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,310
In two days,


567
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,520
our team for army provisions was attacked four times.


568
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,830
We lost a lot!


569
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:12,800
Father.


570
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,070
Why don’t we


571
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,640
negotiate peace with them?


572
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,470
We’re in a dominant position.


573
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,880
It’s time to fight on.


574
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,280
Negotiate peace?


575
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,640
With remaining military strength,


576
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,400
we can’t take over Mu Territory at one stroke.


577
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,400
If it continues,


578
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,830
we’ll be worn out.


579
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,830
Why don’t we stop?


580
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,520
We’ve broken up with Mu Feng.


581
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,280
Will he accept the peace?


582
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,470
We can negotiate.


583
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,190
On what?


584
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,230
Even if we give back one or two cities,


585
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,710
we don’t lose anything.


586
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,430
No negotiation!


587
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:44,350
If Mu Territory is given time to rest,


588
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:46,040
it’ll be harder


589
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,470
to destroy them.


590
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,680
Then may I ask?


591
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:51,310
How can we deal with their constant attack?


592
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,070
With remaining military strength,


593
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,160
how can we continue to get new cities?


594
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,950
I have a plan.


595
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,520
But it depends on


596
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,560
if you’d like to use it.


597
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,350
What is it?


598
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,160
Don’t rush.


599
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,280
I’ll arrange it.


600
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,430
Greeting, My Lady.


601
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,680
No-face.


602
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,950
What do you come for?


603
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,590
I want to ask


604
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,830
if we can give Power of Whisper


605
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,710
to Liu Territory or not.


606
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,880
They’re just humans.


607
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,350
What a waste.


608
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,590
The battle has stalemated.


609
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,920
Mu Feng and his son are very cunning.


610
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,350
If we want to destroy Mu Territory and kill Mu Chen,


611
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,680
this will be


612
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,520
a better way.


613
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,760
Mu Chen


614
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,000
must die.


615
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,950
All right.


616
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,040
Do as you want.


617
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:56,280
Does Mu Chen matter that much?


618
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,830
Mu Chen


619
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:00,000
inherits the Great Futu Spell.


620
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,710
For this,


621
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,280
he must die.


622
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:05,830
Yes.


623
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,830
One more thing.


624
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,429
I caught a girl.


625
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,670
She’s the Goddess of Luo God Clan.


626
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,280
I decide to draw out


627
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,630
her power with Power-dissipating Spell.


628
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,230
After it’s done,


629
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,800
I’ll give the Power-collection Pills


630
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,560
to you and Evil Deity.


631
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,909
If you do that perfectly,


632
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,800
just keep


633
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:29,120
your Power-collection Pills.


634
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,909
I don’t dare to.


635
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,320
Goddess of Luo God Clan?


636
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,560
Why are you so stubborn?


637
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,670
However hard you resist,


638
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,360
nothing will change.


639
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,429
You’re getting more pain only.


640
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,389
Relax.


641
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,870
After I get your power,


642
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,710
you’ll be free.


643
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,520
Are you waiting for your boy?


644
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,670
I want him to come, too.


645
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,950
If I can kill him,


646
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,120
you won’t die alone.


647
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:15,520
Enjoy the last moment you have.


648
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,320
Qian’er.


649
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,710
What do you come for?


650
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,040
To see you.


651
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,910
But I don’t want to see you.


652
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,150
Mr. Tang and my father


653
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,600
have decided the wedding day.


654
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,520
On the second day of next month, in Mu’s Capital,


655
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,190
we’ll get engaged.


656
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:49,560
Once the battle ends,


657
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,390
we’ll have the wedding.


658
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,670
I won’t marry you,


659
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,360
unless you retreat.


660
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,190
I’m afraid your dad will force you.


661
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,000
I’d rather die, then.


662
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,040
Do you hate me that much?


663
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,670
Didn’t we…


664
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,600
Back then,


665
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,080
I thought


666
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,040
you could tell right from wrong.


667
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,630
I failed to see you through.


668
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,120
I’m the Young Master of our territory.


669
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,230
Do you want me to betray my father


670
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,910
and kill my people in the battle?


671
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,040
Tell me.


672
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,150
What should I do?


673
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,080
At least,


674
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,040
you can do nothing!


675
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,000
Please leave.


676
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,230
Who?


677
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:28,230
Stop!


678
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,080
Go after him!


679
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:14,760
Go!


680
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:16,670
Hurry!


681
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,870
Everyone is here.


682
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:25,910
Master.


683
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,670
What are we doing?


684
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,800
You asked me what to do yesterday.


685
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,710
Now I’m telling you.


686
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:36,840
They are captives.


687
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,320
Do you miss home?


688
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:40,320
What do you want?


689
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,430
If you can


690
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,910
defeat the Young Master of Liu Territory,


691
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,520
you’ll be free.


692
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,190
OK, then.


693
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,670
Young Master.


694
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,360
Can you show us what you’ve got?


695
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:00,760
Well…


696
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,760
Mr. Liu.


697
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,390
Take it easy.


698
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,910
Just watch.


699
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:10,910
Sorry.


700
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,000
They’re no match for me.


701
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:37,040
Sure.


702
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,230
I come to help you.


703
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,600
Kill us if you want.


704
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,430
Stop fooling us around.


705
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,630
You must be tired.


706
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,230
Have some water.


707
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,360
If I want to kill you,


708
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:54,120
I have a better way than poisoning you.


709
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:55,950
Come.


710
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:57,800
Drink it.


711
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,840
It’s…


712
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,710
You used it on war magicians


713
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,040
when you attacked the Capital.


714
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:28,520
Exactly.


715
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,910
Power of Whisper.


716
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,520
Fight.


717
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:46,470
What’s going on?


718
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:01,950
Mubai, watch out!


719
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,910
Stop.


720
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,710
Mubai.


721
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:06,910
Mubai.


722
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,320
Are you OK?


723
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,000
I’m fine.


724
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:11,320
I’m fine.


725
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:11,710
Master.


726
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,760
What the hell is


727
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,320
Power of Whisper?


728
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:16,760
Power of Whisper?
