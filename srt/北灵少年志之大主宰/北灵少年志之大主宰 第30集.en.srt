1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,230
Too bad. Mu Chen isn’t here.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:08,880
I can’t kill him.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,840
Never mind.

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,030
When I kill you little sparrow,

6
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,030
Mu Chen will die, too.

7
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,120
I’ll take

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,710
your power pulse.

9
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,790
Let me see how long you can hold.

10
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,910
Since you are seeking for death,

11
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,680
I’ll fulfill your wish.

12
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,269
Bai Tong!

13
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:07,000
Go!

14
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,270
Bai Tong!

15
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,310
Bai Tong!

16
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,000
Bai Tong!

17
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,190
Cangsheng,

18
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,830
they hurt me first.

19
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,270
Although Mu Ling is the master,

20
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:43,590
she can never hurt me.

21
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,120
Who are you?

22
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:59,229
Shen Cangsheng, you are really something.

23
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,000
There!

24
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,440
Stop there!

25
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,550
Shen,

26
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,190
please help Bai Tong.

27
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,240
Stop!

28
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,470
Bai Tong!

29
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,320
Shen, thank you.

30
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:33,630
Bai Tong,

31
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:34,960
how do you feel?

32
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,270
Are you OK?

33
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,960
Good.

34
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,160
Bai Tong,

35
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,470
you got hurt

36
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,600
and lost a lot of power.

37
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,270
I’ll ask them to help you.

38
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,470
Take care of him.

39
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,960
Jiuyou,

40
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,360
can you

41
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,720
not jump to the conclusion so early?

42
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,390
You said

43
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,880
you only treat me as friend.

44
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,830
I know you still like Mu Chen.

45
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:15,830
But…

46
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,320
I’m not worse than him.

47
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,960
I don’t like him.

48
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,270
Why are you still saying that at this time?

49
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,630
Fine.

50
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,360
Let me think about it.

51
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:03,220
The Great Ruler

52
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,100
Episode 30

53
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,720
Qingxuan,

54
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,670
you failed again.

55
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,230
Father,

56
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,790
Mu Chen was lucky this time

57
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,830
that he was not in the Sect.

58
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,320
That’s why…

59
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,640
Enough.

60
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,950
I don’t want to hear your explanation.

61
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,760
Go to White Horse City.

62
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,640
White Horse City?

63
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,880
The day before yesterday, a strong power

64
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,110
broke out in White Horse City.

65
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:13,880
And,

66
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,320
I felt some of the Power of Whisper in it.

67
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,350
I’m interested in it.

68
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,600
Go have a check.

69
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,350
Yes.

70
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:24,200
Qian’er,

71
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,070
if you don’t go home,

72
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,640
your father will be worried.

73
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,950
If I go home,

74
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,790
will you go with me?

75
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,950
My father ruined

76
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,920
your father’s plan.

77
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,550
Although your never talked about it,

78
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,040
I know

79
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,790
you still mind it.

80
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,670
You won’t go with me.

81
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,880
You should go back now.

82
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,600
You are so weak now.

83
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,230
You need a good recuperation.

84
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,510
You can come to me

85
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,350
after you recover.

86
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,040
Can I

87
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,950
find you then?

88
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:06,950
Mubai,

89
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,230
I know you are doing this for me.

90
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,920
But I only want to stay with you.

91
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,720
Liu Territory!

92
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,640
We can go to Liu Territory.

93
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,830
It’s your home.

94
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,070
And nobody else is there.

95
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,230
We can spend

96
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,880
our whole lives there together.

97
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,600
Sorry.

98
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,790
I shouldn’t mention it.

99
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,480
I just want to find

100
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,350
a quiet place where we can live in peace

101
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,350
with no one to disturb us.

102
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,440
It’s up to you.

103
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,470
Finally

104
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,550
we are home.

105
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,840
Let’s live here.

106
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,110
Mubai,

107
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,320
from now on,

108
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,280
no one could

109
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,880
disturb our life anymore.

110
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,230
Father.

111
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,230
Mr. Mo.

112
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,550
I have brought the Sumeru Pillar back.

113
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:51,960
What happened?

114
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,440
Ms. Mu.

115
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,200
They are here for me.

116
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,640
If it was not me,

117
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,200
you wouldn’t have died.

118
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,880
Don’t worry.

119
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:48,550
You,

120
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,400
Headmaster Ling Xi,

121
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,350
Lord Bai,

122
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,550
and Lord White Dragon.

123
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,760
Your sacrifices are not in vain.

124
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,670
We will revenge for you.

125
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,550
I will kill Evil Deity.

126
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,520
This is Sumeru Pillar?

127
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,080
It’s so small.

128
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,400
It looks so ordinary.

129
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,150
Finally you used the word correctly,

130
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,760
but you were wrong again.

131
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,520
It’s not ordinary at all.

132
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,670
Watch out!

133
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,400
Are you OK?

134
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,110
I’m OK.

135
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,670
Such a strong evil power!

136
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,320
When I summoned it

137
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,550
out of the sea,

138
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,230
I tried to control it,

139
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,590
but the evil force repelled me.

140
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,880
I even

141
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,520
thought I would die then.

142
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,030
Now it is imperative to find out

143
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,960
how to subdue this Sumeru Pillar.

144
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,710
Or it would

145
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,880
still be useless.

146
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,000
I wonder

147
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,200
if Mr. Dragon Roc has any idea.

148
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,110
Where is him?

149
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,230
He said it’s so boring to stay here.

150
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,710
He went back for rest.

151
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,150
Mr. Dragon Roc!

152
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,910
Mr. Dragon Roc!

153
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,590
North Sea Dragon Roc!

154
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,470
What? What?

155
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,320
What again?

156
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,150
I can still punish you

157
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,400
even if you did a great job.

158
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,320
Mr. Dragon Roc,

159
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,320
I took the Sumeru Pillar back.

160
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,470
Power of Whisper.

161
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,350
Yes.

162
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,470
So I can’t control it now.

163
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,550
That’s it?

164
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,550
In your dream!

165
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,000
It’s not that easy.

166
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,030
The Power of Lightning

167
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,910
can purify evil power,

168
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,030
but

169
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,110
the evil power in Sumeru Pillar

170
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,000
is not that easy to be purified.

171
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,150
Here is it.

172
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,400
You can put it here.

173
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,150
Maybe after a few hundred days…

174
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,320
A few hundred days?

175
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,110
It will be too late then!

176
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,000
Sir,

177
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,550
we can’t wait anymore.

178
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,760
You should be patient.

179
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,000
Mr. Dragon Roc,

180
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,910
Evil Deity is ready to take actions.

181
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,440
We can’t wait for too long.

182
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,230
Is there anything

183
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,840
can substitute Sumeru Pillar?

184
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,230
Substitute?

185
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,910
It won’t be that easy.

186
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,550
The reason why this pillar

187
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,880
can destroy the Evil Eyes

188
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,910
is that

189
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,470
it has been through
ten thousand years of refinement

190
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:52,150
and contains the strongest power

191
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,550
of Dragon Clan.

192
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,320
Mr. Dragon Roc,

193
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,470
then

194
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,150
what about the treasure of Jiuyou Clan?

195
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,200
You mean…

196
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,960
Phoenix Heritage?

197
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,030
Phoenix Heritage?

198
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,400
What’s that?

199
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,200
Phoenix Heritage

200
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,710
is the treasure of my clan.

201
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,640
It’s different from Sumeru Pillar.

202
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,400
It’s not a thing.

203
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,640
It’s more like a magic pulse.

204
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,320
People of Jiuyou Clan who gets it

205
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,640
will wake up the Phoenix Blood in his body

206
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,080
and becomes Phoenix.

207
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,760
Then he will get a strong power.

208
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,470
Is there a good thing like that?

209
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,350
Jiuyou,

210
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,550
let’s go find it.

211
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,760
Girl,

212
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,350
why do you only say half of that?

213
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,640
It’s because the Phoenix Heritage

214
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,910
is not a magic weapon

215
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,030
that

216
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,550
you must absorb it

217
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,320
if you want to use its power.

218
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,880
Absorb?

219
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,590
Swallow it!

220
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:48,150
It’s a very dangerous process.

221
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,110
Do you know why among the years,

222
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,670
the people of Jiuyou who become Phoenix

223
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,030
are few and far between?

224
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,000
It can kill you!

225
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,200
And the place

226
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,790
where has something like Phoenix Heritage

227
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,670
can’t be a good place.

228
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,710
This is

229
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:06,840
a bad choice.

230
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:07,790
I’ll go!

231
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,520
No!

232
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,710
It’s too dangerous.

233
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,670
Mu Chen,

234
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,150
are you afraid that I’ll get you in trouble?

235
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,550
Jiuyou,

236
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,470
we have other choices now.

237
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,000
We don’t need to take the risk.

238
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,230
Mu Chen,

239
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,520
do you trust me?

240
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:21,910
I do.

241
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,320
Don’t worry.

242
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,710
I will become Phoenix.

243
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,150
But…

244
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,000
My father said

245
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,000
I’m a rare genius in Jiuyou Clan.

246
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,520
If someone can become Phoenix,

247
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,960
it must be me.

248
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,000
A few hundred days?

249
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,880
Do you think we can wait for that long?

250
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,470
I need to go.

251
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,710
Bai Tong,

252
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,790
we heard that you got hurt.

253
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,150
So we are here to see you.

254
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,080
Bai Tong!

255
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,960
Do you feel better now?

256
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,030
I’m better now.

257
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,520
It’s not a big deal.

258
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,790
I have a strong body.

259
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,200
Your magic pulse got hurt.

260
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,350
It has nothing to do with your strong body.

261
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,110
If you can come to see me often,

262
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,760
I’ll recover soon.

263
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,470
I’m here to say goodbye.

264
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,840
I got something to do.

265
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,790
I’ll leave in a few days.

266
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,550
Is he with you?

267
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,520
I’m in as well.

268
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,670
No!

269
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,710
You should have more rest.

270
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,760
I’m worried about you.

271
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,440
It’s OK.

272
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,640
I’ll be fine.

273
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,000
Bai Tong,

274
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,230
we’ll go now.

275
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,440
Take good care of yourself.

276
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,400
What happened between you two?

277
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,280
Stop that!

278
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,070
Power of Whisper…

279
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,380
[Grave of Liu Mubai]

280
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,880
What again?

281
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,430
Rosemary Circle.

282
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,880
Looks like you’ve been slacking off lately.

283
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,880
It’s all the

284
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,070
same old tricks.

285
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,880
Don’t you like this?

286
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,400
There is no free lunch.

287
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,640
Tell me,

288
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,000
what are you up to this time?

289
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,590
I know what you want to do.

290
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,070
You want to

291
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,230
find Phoenix Heritage with Jiuyou.

292
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,560
But you promised me that

293
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,230
you would go to Luo God Clan with me.

294
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,830
You’re afraid that I will be angry.

295
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,310
So you played up to me first.

296
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:39,710
I can’t hide anything from you.

297
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,590
I have thought about it for a long time.

298
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,590
Even if you don’t mention it,

299
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,560
I will let you do that.

300
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,230
Both publicly and privately,

301
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,680
you should go with her.

302
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,070
Now you still

303
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,400
can’t use Sumeru Pillar.

304
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,830
If Jiuyou can become Phoenix,

305
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,160
she will be able to help us to destroy the Evil Eyes.

306
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,280
I'm just

307
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,760
worried about you.

308
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,430
Don’t worry.

309
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,880
I will be fine.

310
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,640
This is…

311
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,710
Jiuyou Spirit Blood.

312
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,400
She gave it to me

313
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,070
in your absence.

314
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,350
She gave it to you forwardly?

315
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,760
So this time I’ll become

316
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,350
Saintess after I go back.

317
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,760
So, rest assured.

318
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,400
This time

319
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,880
I owe Jiuyou too much.

320
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,560
So if you go with her,

321
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,110
you're doing me a favor.

322
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,110
What’s more,

323
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,040
you two are connected

324
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,280
to live or die together.

325
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,190
So,

326
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,590
you should go with her.

327
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,040
Watch this

328
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,310
if you miss me.

329
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,400
I will wait for you in Luo City.

330
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,280
When we meet again,

331
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,160
I will show you

332
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,590
more beautiful Rosemary Circles.

333
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,190
I’m looking forward to it.

334
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,280
It’s done.

335
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
I will sleep outside.

336
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,280
No.

337
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,640
You haven’t recovered yet.

338
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,800
You can’t sleep outside.

339
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:34,880
Qian’er.

340
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,920
Are you sleeping?

341
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,710
You shouldn’t have done so much for me.

342
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,400
Without me,

343
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,160
you are still the Young Lady of Tang Territory

344
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,350
and the top student in North Sect.

345
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,920
But now

346
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,470
you can only stay here

347
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,680
with me.

348
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,070
I’m sorry.

349
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,310
I have

350
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,560
lost everything.

351
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,470
The only thing

352
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,280
I have is my life now.

353
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,640
I will spend the rest of my time

354
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,950
with you.

355
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,070
Mu Chen,

356
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,190
you will meet a lot of dangers

357
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,110
on the way to find Phoenix Heritage.

358
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,520
Don’t you really need my help?

359
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,190
Alright, Master Shen.

360
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,710
You are the headmaster of North Sect now.

361
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:00,040
They can’t go on without you.

362
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,400
If I can,

363
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,590
I don’t want to be the headmaster.

364
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,640
I like to travel in my whole life.

365
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:11,880
Mu Chen,

366
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,710
Shen can’t go with you.

367
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,160
Why don’t you let me go either?

368
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,400
Now North Sect needs more people.

369
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,830
You should stay here

370
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,280
and help Shen.

371
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,110
Chen…

372
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,590
Alright, father.

373
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,000
I know.

374
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,520
I will be careful and

375
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,430
take good care of myself.

376
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,400
I won’t

377
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,710
act rashly again.

378
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,590
You know it again.

379
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,040
What do you plan to do next?

380
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:34,920
Go back home?

381
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:35,640
Yes.

382
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,000
I’ll go back with Mr. Mo tomorrow.

383
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,800
Devil-dissipating Circle

384
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:40,950
is almost done.

385
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,040
We can't watch you young people work

386
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,400
while we do nothing.

387
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,350
OK.

388
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,110
You must be careful.

389
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:48,800
Got it.

390
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,280
You should take care as well.

391
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,040
OK.

392
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,230
I’m leaving now.

393
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,760
I’ll wait for you.

394
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,110
Jiuyou,

395
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,920
where is

396
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,280
the Phoenix Heritage?

397
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,040
Can the teleporting formation send you there?

398
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,000
It’s in Land of Beasts.

399
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,760
We can’t go there through the teleporting formation.

400
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,000
But the closest teleporting formation

401
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,680
is only thirty miles from there.

402
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,640
Guys, see you.

403
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,640
Shen,

404
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,350
I need to go as well.

405
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,950
See you.

406
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,680
Take care.

407
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,280
Let’s go back now.

408
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,160
Please.

409
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,110
Land of Beasts…

410
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,710
Miss,

411
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,350
are they asters and rat leaves?

412
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,110
Yes.

413
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,280
You are…

414
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,230
I'm a dealer in herbal medicine.

415
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,560
I used to buy herbs here.

416
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,190
But today

417
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,590
I haven’t seen them.

418
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,520
You are the only one here

419
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,760
with the herbs I want.

420
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,710
So, I wonder

421
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,110
if you can sell these to me.

422
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,280
Of course, my pleasure.

423
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,040
You

424
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,230
want all of them?

425
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:03,710
Yes,

426
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:04,640
all of them.

427
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,800
To be honest, I will be here every three days

428
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,430
to buy herbs.

429
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,110
If you’d like to sell them to me,

430
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,800
you can wait for me here.

431
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:14,920
OK.

432
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,590
That’s a deal.

433
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,520
Here are the magic stones for you.

434
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:22,830
Here.

435
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,590
Master,

436
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,560
I have done it under your order.

437
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,000
Keep it a secret.

438
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,710
Don’t let Qian’er know this.

439
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,400
Yes.

440
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:54,920
Mubai,

441
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,920
I got a lot of food today.

442
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,520
It’s enough for us to eat a few days.

443
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,880
You did this?

444
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,190
You need to sell herbs

445
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,710
and find us food.

446
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,400
I think you will be happy

447
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,520
if there is a meal after you come back.

448
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,430
You are recovering.

449
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,280
This is not enough for you.

450
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,710
I’ll go make one more dish.

451
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:24,970
Mubai,

452
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,110
where are the food here?

453
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,470
There was an accident

454
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,830
when I was cooking.

455
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,000
That’s all left.

456
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,920
It’s OK.

457
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,350
I was lucky today.

458
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,430
I met a dealer in herb medicine.

459
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,800
He promised me

460
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,430
that he will buy my herbs every week.

461
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,470
Look,

462
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,880
I got a lot of food.

463
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,800
It’s enough for us for days.

464
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,520
I didn’t expect that

465
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,400
herbs can be so popular in the market.

466
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,350
Maybe

467
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,040
we can start a medicine shop here.

468
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:01,680
Have a try.

469
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,640
OK.

470
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,190
Is it terrible?

471
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,400
No, it’s great.

472
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,110
Don’t need to comfort me.

473
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,520
I’m not.

474
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,640
To be honest,

475
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,640
I haven’t done much cooking, either.

476
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,310
Maybe my cooking

477
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,710
will be worse than yours.

478
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,230
But we can study it

479
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,470
together.

480
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,160
Yes.

481
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,470
We can learn together.

482
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,830
I'll cook for you

483
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,310
for the rest of my life.

484
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:17,560
Goddess.

485
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,400
The Goddess really comes back!

486
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,350
Brother,

487
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,710
why did you call me that again?

488
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,560
She should have married.

489
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,310
I’ll call you Luo Li in private.

490
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,590
But in public,

491
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,950
I should have manners.

492
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,590
OK.

493
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,230
Actually, if we give her to them,

494
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,000
we’ll be safe.

495
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,880
But Leader didn’t agree.

496
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:38,950
And we don’t know why.

497
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,430
He shouldn’t lose the whole clan

498
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,760
for his love for granddaughter.

499
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,280
Xuantong.

500
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:16,950
Grandpa.

501
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,070
Luo Li.

502
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,680
Luo Li, how have you been?

503
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,800
Grandpa,

504
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,640
I’m back.

505
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:37,760
Grandpa!

506
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,040
Luo Li!

507
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,160
It’s really you!

508
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:43,680
You…

509
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,350
You are back!

510
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,310
Let me see you carefully.

511
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,040
You lost weight.

512
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,280
Grandpa,

513
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,950
how have you been?

514
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:55,760
I’m fine.

515
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,230
I’m fine.

516
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,640
Why do you come back suddenly?

517
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,920
I miss you.

518
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:03,920
So I come back to see you.

519
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,710
Nonsense!

520
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,470
I asked

521
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,800
Mr. Mo to take good care of you.

522
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,160
Look at him.

523
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,040
Did he forget what he promised me?

524
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:14,590
Grandpa,

525
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,640
Mr. Mo has taken good care of you.

526
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,110
I’m not a kid anymore.

527
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,280
I’m the Goddess of Luo God Clan.

528
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,110
Now my clan is in trouble.

529
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,310
I can’t stay out of this.

530
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,110
It’s been a while.

531
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,640
Luo Li,

532
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,470
you are talking differently from before.

533
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:36,710
Yes.

534
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,560
Many things have happened.

535
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,950
I’m worried about you.

536
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,160
My kid,

537
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,920
the grudge between Xue God Clan and us

538
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,760
has been existed for a long time.

539
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,800
With or without you,

540
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,190
Xue Lingzi

541
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,830
will always cause trouble to us.

542
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,190
He is taking you as an excuse now.

543
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:02,880
It’s just

544
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:05,190
a cunning trick.

545
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,160
Grandpa,

546
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,560
I know this.

547
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,350
After the trip to Beiling,

548
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:13,190
I have learned more than just talking.

549
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,560
Avoiding won’t solve the problem.

550
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,880
Facing danger

551
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,560
without fear

552
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:24,950
is the right way.

553
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,230
What’s more…

554
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,830
Jiuyou Spirit Blood!

555
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:37,710
Luo Li,

556
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,430
you made it!

557
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,400
However,

558
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,000
the test of Luo Offering

559
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,280
is not that easy to pass.

560
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:53,520
You can’t know it before you try.

561
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,430
Grandpa,

562
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:01,040
how is the war going now?

563
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,920
We and the Xue God Clan

564
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,160
are now in a truce.

565
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,000
But you know,

566
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,670
it could start again anytime.

567
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,560
Now we are full of wounded men.

568
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:18,280
Our forces are already stretched.

569
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:19,800
Report!

570
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:20,760
Leader,

571
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,429
Elder Tianlong, Elder Qingya

572
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,560
and Elder Xiu are waiting to see you.

573
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,320
They came so soon.

574
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,360
Let them in.

575
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:29,320
Yes.

576
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:30,760
Luo Li,

577
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:32,840
take this away.

578
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,670
What a coincidence!

579
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:44,080
Our Goddess is back!

580
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,560
Luo Xiu,

581
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,520
stop pretending.

582
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:50,630
You must come here after you have known

583
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:52,080
the news of Goddess’s return.

584
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,620
[Luo Tianlong  Elder of Luo God Clan]

585
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,230
Luo Li.

586
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,800
It’s been a while.

587
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,700
[Luo Qingya  Elder of Luo God Clan]

588
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,840
Uncle Tianlong.

589
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,100
[Luo Xiu  Elder of Luo God Clan]

590
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,950
Grandpa Qingya.

591
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,230
Uncle Xiu.

592
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,630
Luo Li.

593
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,630
You should go back for rest.

594
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,950
It was a long trip.

595
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,910
It must have cost you a lot of power.

596
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,190
Yes.

597
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,670
Leader,

598
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,040
since Luo Li is back,

599
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,280
you should tell us the truth now.

600
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,190
You are the leader,

601
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,280
but you always shield your granddaughter.

602
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,870
Is the safety of all the people of our clan

603
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,560
less important

604
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,120
than the happiness

605
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,320
of your granddaughter?

606
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,000
I think you are being muddled.

607
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,670
If we give them Luo Li,

608
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,000
we will lose our dignity.

609
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,280
I think you are just spoiling your granddaughter.

610
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:50,190
We have been against Xue God Clan for years.

611
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,760
It will be a disaster

612
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:54,630
if there is another war again.

613
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,800
Only by giving them Luo Li

614
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:58,520
can we keep our clan safe.

615
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,670
Tell me.

616
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,150
What’s wrong with that?

617
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,360
Yes,

618
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,080
it seems that Xue Lingzi

619
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,320
loves Luo Li a lot.

620
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,040
If Luo Li could marry him,

621
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:08,600
she won’t lose anything.

622
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,600
Once Luo Li becomes the Lady of Xue God Clan,

623
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,670
of course it will be

624
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,390
good to our clan.

625
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,230
Have you done?

626
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,230
Have you ever considered that?

627
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,470
If we really send Luo Li there,

628
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,520
will Luo God Clan be saved?

629
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,800
Even if

630
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,560
Xue God Clan stops the war after that,

631
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:38,760
we marry

632
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,910
our Goddess to them during the war

633
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,040
in trade for peace.

634
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,360
What does that mean?

635
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,760
That means

636
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,520
it’s not a compromise,

637
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,950
but surrender!

638
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,430
In the future,

639
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,670
their oppression will only get worse.

640
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,080
And we

641
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,150
are not to get any better.

642
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,760
But, if we don’t marry her to them,

643
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,840
we will be faced with a severe war.

644
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,320
It is because of your cowardice

645
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,040
that we have

646
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,430
fallen to such a state.

647
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:08,840
Tianlong!

648
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,000
I can marry Xue Lingzi.

649
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:16,910
Goddess!

650
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:17,950
What are you talking about?

651
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,040
Trust me.

652
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,390
You are willing to marry Xue Lingzi?

653
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,000
Luo Li!

654
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,320
You…

655
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:29,950
Grandpa.

656
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:30,910
Elders.

657
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:33,000
Listen to me first.

658
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,560
I can marry Xue Lingzi.

659
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,520
But I have a request.

660
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,520
I hope you can promise me.

661
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:40,360
Go ahead.

662
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,230
My request is

663
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,150
to hold the test of Luo Offering
as soon as possible.

664
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,320
If I fail the test,

665
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,470
I will marry Xue Lingzi immediately

666
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,320
and have no regrets.

667
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,470
The test of Luo Offering is dangerous.

668
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,040
It’s good if you can succeed.

669
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,120
But if you fail,

670
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,470
you will get heavily injured,

671
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,190
even die!

672
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:11,120
What if Xue Lingzi comes

673
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:11,670
to ask for you again?

674
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,120
I have found Jiuyou Spirit Blood.

675
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,040
Even if I fail,

676
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,950
I won’t lose my life.

677
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,390
Leader,

678
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,360
Luo Li has got Jiuyou Spirit Blood?

679
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,800
Why don’t you tell us?

680
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,600
You have known it now.

681
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:29,560
But will you not force her to marry

682
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,870
Xue Lingzi again?

683
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,670
Leader,

684
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,040
our clan

685
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,710
can’t bear a war anymore.

686
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,760
Then you think

687
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,760
we can get peace

688
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:41,600
by marrying Luo Li to them?

689
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,150
Grandpa Qingya,

690
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,840
I promise with my life that

691
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,390
I was voluntary to marry Xue Lingzi before.

692
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:49,630
But that day

693
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:52,080
when Xue Lingzi’s henchman, Xue Shi,

694
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:54,000
came to Beiling to pick me up,

695
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,950
I heard it on the road that

696
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,870
once I marry to Xue God Clan,

697
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,670
Xue Lingzi will break the promise right away

698
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,230
and attack Luo God Clan.

699
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:03,870
Did you hear that?

700
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:04,910
Qingya,

701
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,840
I hope you can understand.

702
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,470
If we need to save us out of trouble

703
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,520
with my own life,

704
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,910
I will give my life to you without hesitation.

705
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,280
But now,

706
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,120
only the Saintess of our clan

707
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,190
can save us.

708
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:21,910
Fine.

709
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,760
I promise you.

710
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,230
As long as Luo Li can become Saintess,

711
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,560
I, Luo Qingya,

712
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:29,710
will listen

713
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,600
to Saintess’ orders unconditionally.

714
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,910
But if she fails,

715
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,870
she has to keep her words

716
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,320
and marry Xue Lingzi.

717
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,120
Let’s leave.

718
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:51,670
Brother.

719
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,910
You can go now.

720
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,360
I have something to say to Luo Li.

721
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:58,910
OK.

722
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,520
Luo Li,

723
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,950
why are you so impulsive?

724
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,560
I wanted

725
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,950
to hold the test secretly before.

726
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,670
Once you become the Saintess,

727
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,280
they will have nothing to say.

728
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,600
And our people can fight

729
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,800
together with you.

730
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:24,390
But…

731
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:28,000
But now you made a deal with them.

732
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,630
Have you thought about

733
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,630
what to do

734
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,950
if you really fail?

735
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:35,870
Grandpa.

736
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,910
There are many rumors in our clan.

737
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:38,760
Disunity

738
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,080
is much scarier than Xue God Clan.

739
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,000
The crisis can only be solved by

740
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,840
the unity and

741
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:46,910
struggle of the whole clan.

742
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,000
We shouldn’t hold the test secretly.

743
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,230
The best way to unite our people

744
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,190
is to do it publicly and succeed.

745
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:02,520
Luo Li,

746
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,560
you really have grown up.
