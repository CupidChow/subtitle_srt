1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,760
Taoist, you’re making wine here

3
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,470
at midnight?

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,520
Making wine?

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,390
You know nothing.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,950
This is not normal wine.

7
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,760
It’s nectar from the heaven.

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,920
I have

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,710
traveled around the world

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,230
alone without

11
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,710
any good hobby

12
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,760
except for drinking wine.

13
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,000
I have drank all the wine in the world.

14
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,550
But I’m getting bored of the normal wine.

15
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:32,750
So

16
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,560
I tried

17
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,000
to make fine wine myself.

18
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,240
Taoist,

19
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:38,840
it’s our fate to meet.

20
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,270
Since we are so predestined,

21
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,520
how about give us some

22
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,200
to have a try?

23
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,400
I’m not being mean.

24
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,400
I’m afraid

25
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,000
you’re not capable to bear it.

26
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,680
It’s not normal wine.

27
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,430
You will get deep drunk

28
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,680
only after you take a sip.

29
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,950
Don’t waste time.

30
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,240
Let’s move now.

31
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,480
He seems to be familiar.

32
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:06,630
Taoist,

33
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,039
did we meet somewhere before?

34
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:11,870
I have traveled many places.

35
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,950
The people I have ever met

36
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,440
are countless.

37
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,039
Maybe we

38
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,550
did meet somewhere before.

39
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:19,510
Taoist,

40
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:20,440
since it is so,

41
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,830
why don’t you take off your mask

42
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,039
and let us see your face?

43
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,720
How rude!

44
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,270
You want to take off my mask?

45
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,039
It seems that

46
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,310
I will drink this wine alone.

47
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,160
Taoist,

48
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,000
seems that

49
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,759
we can’t enjoy it with you.

50
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,120
Taoist,

51
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,120
farewell.

52
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,360
Goddess,

53
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,039
let’s go.

54
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,870
What a pity!

55
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,630
Although it’s a good wine,

56
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,830
I can only enjoy it alone.

57
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,160
It will be really boring.

58
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,120
If Disguising Pill loses efficacy,

59
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,910
I’ll be in trouble.

60
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,190
Great!

61
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,190
My efforts for three years are not invalid.

62
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,550
I didn’t expect this wine

63
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,670
to have such power.

64
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,700
The Great Ruler

65
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,579
Episode 9

66
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:48,910
Taoist,

67
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,440
what is it in your hand?

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,630
Come on,

69
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,079
hit me with your sword.

70
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,880
No more questions,

71
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,829
just do it.

72
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,630
I didn’t imagine

73
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,960
that this wine could

74
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,190
give me such a strong power.

75
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,880
I’m invincible now.

76
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,110
Captain,

77
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,470
he said

78
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,520
he could give us some.

79
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,880
Just say yes.

80
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,390
Captain!

81
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,829
I’m so lucky

82
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,390
to meet you guys.

83
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,200
I’m satisfied now.

84
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,000
See you.

85
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:26,880
Wait!

86
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:29,920
Taoist,

87
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,320
you just said you could give us

88
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,200
some of your nectar.

89
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,200
Sir,

90
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,270
you didn’t want it just now, did you?

91
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,600
I changed my mind.

92
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,000
Taoist,

93
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,200
can we have some?

94
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,550
Of course!

95
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:56,920
Sir!

96
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,440
Please drink slowly.

97
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,110
Leave some to me.

98
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,040
This wine tastes so good!

99
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,270
Goddess,

100
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,880
have a try.

101
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,160
Taoist,

102
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,920
this nectar

103
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,390
is really a good wine.

104
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,760
But I didn’t feel

105
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,230
my power get stronger.

106
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,070
But my steps get heavier.

107
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,110
Taoist,

108
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:35,720
I feel…

109
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,320
Taoist, you…

110
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,350
I’ve told you

111
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,070
that it’s not a wine

112
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,720
for you common people.

113
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,950
I knew who you are.

114
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,790
Why are you here?

115
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,110
Why did you lie to me?

116
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,600
Are you really going to marry Xue Lingzi?

117
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,350
Yes,

118
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,830
I’m going to marry him and I have to.

119
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,000
I won’t go back with you.

120
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,640
You get me wrong.

121
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,070
I’m not here to take you away.

122
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,390
I put Truth Pill in the wine.

123
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,480
It’s the pill my father made before.

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,200
It can make you tell the truth.

125
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,510
It can help me get information

126
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,950
from my captives.

127
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,600
What’s your name?

128
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,510
Xue Shi.

129
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,920
Why did you come to Beiling?

130
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,550
My Leader ordered me to take goddess

131
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,159
back to get married with him.

132
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,920
Luo God Clan and Xue God Clan

133
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,350
are having wars for years, right?

134
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:41,920
Yes.

135
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,350
Did your Leader promise

136
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,510
that if Luo Li marries him,

137
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,950
he will stop the war

138
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,790
and never intrude into Luo?

139
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,350
Yes.

140
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,110
Will he keep his words?

141
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,070
Of course not.

142
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,440
What will he do?

143
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,110
Our Leader said,

144
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,270
after they get married,

145
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,510
he will wipe out Luo God Clan.

146
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,830
You heard that.

147
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,790
Are you still willing to go back with him?

148
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:15,830
Luo Li,

149
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,920
meaningless sacrifices

150
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,040
are foolish.

151
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,550
I believe that

152
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,270
your grandpa doesn’t want to see

153
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,720
you sacrifice yourself in vain.

154
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,320
Or he wouldn’t have sent you to Beiling.

155
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,070
Go back with me,

156
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,230
OK?

157
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,640
I can’t go now.

158
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,600
Xue Shi sealed my power.

159
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,040
I’m just like a normal person now.

160
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,270
I can’t escape.

161
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,390
Luo Li,

162
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,510
do you want to marry Xue Lingzi?

163
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,040
I won’t let you do the things you don’t want to.

164
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,670
If you don’t,

165
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,480
I won’t allow that happen.

166
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,760
What are you doing?

167
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,159
You can’t run now.

168
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,670
But I can.

169
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,440
Give me that.

170
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,030
Yes.

171
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,880
Young Master,

172
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,320
it’s time for meal.

173
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,110
Do you want me to feed you?

174
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,150
Qian’er?

175
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,640
Why are you here?

176
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,590
You don’t want to see me?

177
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,230
Right,

178
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,590
why did your father lock you up?

179
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,590
The Lake of Dragon is a lie.

180
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,880
My father’s real goal is to attack Mu Territory.

181
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,840
What?

182
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,640
What should we do now?

183
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,350
No-face Taoist and my father have set off.

184
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,790
What we should do now

185
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,150
is to inform Mr. Mu as soon as possible.

186
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,400
It can’t be late.

187
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,790
I’ll go with you.

188
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,520
Young Master!

189
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,350
Step aside.

190
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,640
I’m going to the Transmitting Circle.

191
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,400
Young Master,

192
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,520
Ruler said

193
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,400
that without his order,

194
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,320
no one can use the Transmitting Circle.

195
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,670
I’m the Young Master here.

196
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,960
My father is away,

197
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,280
and I’m the one in charge now.

198
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,640
If you disobey,

199
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,400
before my father comes back,

200
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,710
I can execute you on the spot now.

201
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:29,710
Yes.

202
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,110
Bastard!

203
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,520
So despicable!

204
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,150
Good-for-nothing!

205
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,550
Now,

206
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,520
go after them!

207
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,640
Yes!

208
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,440
Is Mr. Mu at home?

209
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,470
Young Master Liu and Young Lady Tang,

210
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,710
you want to see my master?

211
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,590
But they went away yesterday.

212
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,320
No,

213
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,710
we’re late.

214
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,520
Where is Mu Chen?

215
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,790
Young Master should have gone with them.

216
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,150
But he went eastward

217
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,350
with no reason left.

218
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,590
He also has left for days.

219
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,710
Get me paper and pen.

220
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,760
Yes.

221
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,080
When Mu Chen comes back, please give this to him.

222
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,200
It can’t be delayed.

223
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,030
I will.

224
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,840
Mubai,

225
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,670
what should we do next?

226
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:24,910
I’m going to the Lake of Dragon

227
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:25,840
to tell Mr. Mu.

228
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,080
It will be too late

229
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,000
if we go from here.

230
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,030
We can use the Transmitting Circle here

231
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,910
to go to Tang Territory first.

232
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,880
Tang is the closest one to the Lake of Dragon.

233
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,080
I hope I can arrive in time.

234
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,030
I will go with you.

235
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,200
I can go ask my father to help you.

236
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,030
I need you to go to Beiling School

237
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,880
to tell Mr. Mo now.

238
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,110
They can help us.

239
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,150
When the reinforce comes,

240
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,520
head to the Lake of Dragon.

241
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,150
I’ll be worried if you go alone.

242
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,840
If you are worried,

243
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,960
then take Mr. Mo and others to there
as soon as possible.

244
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,880
Then Mr. Mu and I

245
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,640
will be safe and sound.

246
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,110
I will arrive in time.

247
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,400
Go now.

248
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,230
Mubai,

249
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,110
promise me.

250
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,350
If it can’t be changed,

251
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,470
don’t get yourself killed.

252
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,710
Mu Chen,

253
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,910
put me down.

254
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,960
Luo Li,

255
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,880
what’s wrong?

256
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,840
Are you OK?

257
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,520
I’m fine.

258
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,280
Idiot,

259
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,350
she doesn’t want you to carry her.

260
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,280
She is trying to break the seal forcibly.

261
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,080
Luo Li,

262
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,910
I’ll take you away from here.

263
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,760
I won’t let them catch you again.

264
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,960
Don’t be so sure.

265
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,550
I said you sounds familiar.

266
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,280
It turns out that you are Mu Chen.

267
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,350
Here I am.

268
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,440
So what?

269
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,000
I made the wine for you especially.

270
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,000
Is that good?

271
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,440
Luo Li!

272
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,320
Luo Li.

273
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,230
Luo Li,

274
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,000
you destroy the seal forcibly.

275
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,520
Can your body bear it?

276
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,640
Cut the crap.

277
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:39,960
Show your strength.

278
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:40,760
Luo Li,

279
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,590
how could you break your promise?

280
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,080
Do you want our military

281
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,350
attack your Clan?

282
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,880
Even if I go with you,

283
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,520
you won’t spare my Clan either.

284
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,840
I won’t be cheated again.

285
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,910
Mu Chen,

286
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,710
I told you not to cause trouble again.

287
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,760
See?

288
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,200
You still need my help here.

289
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,760
Mu Chen!

290
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,520
Mu Chen!

291
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,200
Xue Shi,

292
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,030
don’t try to take Luo Li away today.

293
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,150
Fight!

294
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,880
If you want to die,

295
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,200
I will satisfy you.

296
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:29,960
Good.

297
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,230
We’ll see you next time.

298
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,640
Tell your Leader,

299
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,350
don’t think about Luo Li anymore.

300
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,520
Let’s go.

301
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,640
Mu Chen!

302
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,320
Wait,

303
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,560
I’ll go meet Mr. Liu first.

304
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,640
You wait here.

305
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,280
Sir!

306
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,349
Don’t worry.

307
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,000
I’ll be fine.

308
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,430
The three of you,

309
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,800
protect the Ruler!

310
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,310
Yes.

311
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,109
Let’s go.

312
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,470
The army of Liu Territory should have got there.

313
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,040
Why is there no tents?

314
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,350
Report!

315
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,190
We were ambushed!

316
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,710
General Zhou Ye is fighting.

317
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,830
What a scene!

318
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,680
Mu Feng,

319
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,040
the one protecting the Lake

320
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,470
shouldn’t be Mu Territory.

321
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,230
What do you want?

322
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,190
What do you think?

323
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:05,880
Look.

324
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,310
We are now in

325
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,950
the area just east by south of Mu’s Capital,

326
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,110
and the Lake of Dragon is
in the northwest of Mu’s Capital.

327
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,710
It will cost us two days

328
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,950
if we go to the Lake of Dragon

329
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,350
from here.

330
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,160
My father

331
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,760
has set off to the Lake of Dragon.

332
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,230
He may have arrived.

333
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,400
We should head back to the Capital now

334
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,950
and go to Tang Territory through Transmitting Circle,

335
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,400
then we can go to the Lake of Dragon from there.

336
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,590
It only needs one day.

337
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,400
Then let’s go

338
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,470
back to Mu’s Capital.

339
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:39,280
The same day next year is your death day!

340
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,350
I’ll make a rear guard.

341
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,430
You take them leave first.

342
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,310
No way!

343
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,560
General Zhou Ye asked me

344
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,920
to protect you.

345
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,560
I can’t leave you here.

346
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,800
Fight!

347
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,430
Kill them all!

348
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,160
Mr. Mu!

349
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,400
Why did you come alone?

350
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,400
Where is your father?

351
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,560
My father is not here.

352
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,160
It’s his plot with No-face Taoist.

353
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,000
He colluded with the Dragon Clan.

354
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,920
He wants to conquer Mu Territory

355
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,230
and attack Mu’s Capital.

356
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,070
Liu Mubai,

357
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,070
you are such an unfilial son.

358
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,560
I will give you a lesson for your father today!

359
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,430
The reinforce is here.

360
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:52,560
Mubai!

361
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,880
We are here to help you.

362
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:54,560
Mr. Mu.

363
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,110
Mr. Mu.

364
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,070
Mr. Mo is helping General Zhou Ye

365
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,070
to fight the Dragon Clan.

366
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,560
Please rush out with us!

367
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:00,520
OK.

368
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,350
Mo Xingtian,

369
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,950
I’d like to know how long you can hold on.

370
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,160
Fine,

371
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,830
it’s a lot of you.

372
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:35,830
Young Master,

373
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,350
Liu Mubai and Tang Qian’er were here.

374
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,590
They asked me to give you this.

375
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,520
Where are they?

376
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,710
They came in a hurry.

377
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,760
So they left this bag here.

378
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,190
Mu Chen,

379
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,000
the battle of Lake of Dragon

380
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,520
is a conspiracy between my father and No-face Taoist.

381
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,950
They want to siege the main force of Mu Territory

382
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,160
and conquer Mu’s Capital.

383
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,160
We should take precaution as soon as possible.

384
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,040
I have gone to the Lake to inform Mr. Mu.

385
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,640
Hope we can stop the plot in time.

386
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,590
Liu Mubai.

387
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,590
What to do now?

388
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:05,950
Who is

389
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,470
in charge of the defense of the city?

390
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,230
Shu Zhang.

391
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,040
How is it?

392
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,230
Don’t make him move.

393
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,000
Are you alright?

394
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,070
Thank you for coming to help.

395
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,680
You should thank

396
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,710
these two kids.

397
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,640
It should be

398
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,310
the matter between Mu and Liu Territory.

399
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,950
I never expected

400
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,230
Beiling School would get involved.

401
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,190
Liu Qingtian colludes with the Dragon Clan

402
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,800
to plot the Beiling.

403
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,350
Mu Feng,

404
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,830
it's not just that you two territories

405
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,350
are at odds with each other.

406
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,040
Mubai,

407
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,110
your father did that.

408
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,920
Not you.

409
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,000
You know black from white,

410
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,040
and helped Mu Feng.

411
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,280
That’s a good action.

412
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:09,470
Mubai,

413
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,950
I’m really grateful for that.

414
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,430
That’s what I should do.

415
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:14,710
Mr. Mu,

416
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,680
Mu’s Capital is in trouble now.

417
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,280
We should go back now.

418
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,470
Capital?

419
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,680
Why?

420
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,830
I’m afraid that my father

421
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,160
has pitched camps

422
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,710
with the army outside the Capital.

423
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,350
Mo,

424
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,110
there are so many of us.

425
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,590
If we move together,

426
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,110
that’ll be obvious.

427
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,280
Here is a way.

428
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,640
We can branch out into two columns

429
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,430
and siege the Capital together.

430
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,110
OK.

431
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,640
That’s also what I want to do.

432
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,760
I’m Shu Zhang,

433
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,470
greetings, Young Master.

434
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,160
General Shu,

435
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,680
how many guards do we have now in Capital?

436
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,800
About three thousand.

437
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,430
How many of them have magic power?

438
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,640
Less than two hundred.

439
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,710
And most of the tops

440
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,000
have left with Ruler.

441
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,470
No.

442
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,880
It’s far from enough.

443
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,430
Young Master, what happened?

444
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,590
It’s not enough to fight against Liu Territory.

445
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,110
Liu Territory?

446
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,470
Aren’t we already allied with them?

447
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,470
Liu betrayed our alliance.

448
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,110
Now they have gathered army

449
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,430
and will come to attack

450
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,110
our capital in a few hours.

451
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,070
Liu is threatening.

452
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,760
We can’t resist it at all.

453
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,350
General Shu,

454
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,430
please open the Transmitting Circle and

455
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,110
escort the people to evacuate safely.

456
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:35,640
Yes.

457
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,230
I will send guards to gather the people.

458
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,000
Young Master,

459
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,000
how will we protect our city?

460
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,560
You leave together with the people.

461
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,800
Young Master,

462
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,680
I’m the defender of Mu Territory.

463
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,230
I can’t give up our city.

464
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,920
Shu Zhang will live or die together with the city!

465
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:54,640
General Shu,

466
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,280
we can get our city back again.

467
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,520
But if I lose you,

468
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,640
I can’t get you back anymore.

469
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,000
Nowadays, there is a great disparity
between the enemy and our forces.

470
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,880
There is no need to fight unnecessarily.

471
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,830
It’s not to

472
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,520
guard the city,

473
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,350
but the safety of our people.

474
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,430
I got it.

475
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:14,470
Go now.

476
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,710
Yes.

477
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,430
Luo Li,

478
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,190
I’m sorry.

479
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,350
I wanted to help you.

480
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,710
I never expected

481
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,400
to get you involved into this.

482
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,680
What can I help you?

483
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,190
Come with me.

484
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,230
Mu Chen,

485
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,520
how does the picture you want

486
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,110
look like?

487
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,800
I’ve never seen it as well.

488
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,000
But it must be dirty and old.

489
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,430
I want the City Protection Circle of Mu.

490
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,310
I haven’t been born when the last time

491
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,040
they used it.

492
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:00,760
Mu Chen.

493
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:12,880
That’s it.

494
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,070
Let’s go.

495
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,280
Mu Chen,

496
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,280
how will

497
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,000
the City Protection Circle be like?

498
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,590
Manpower will be exhausted.

499
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,920
The size of the magic circle that humans can control

500
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:32,710
is limited.

501
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,800
If you want to start

502
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,040
a circle which can protect the whole city,

503
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,520
you should integrate it into the city

504
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,830
when you build the city.

505
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,430
It’s here.

506
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,710
The circle won’t be started at ordinary times.

507
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,350
But at the critical moment,

508
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,710
as long as the power is poured into a specific place,

509
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,350
the whole city

510
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,430
will become a huge circle.

511
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,760
That will be the City Protection Circle.

512
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,000
But, Mu Chen,

513
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,710
aren’t we going to evacuate?

514
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,280
What do you want to do by starting

515
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,880
the circle now?

516
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,800
We are going to evacuate.

517
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,640
But we can’t let Liu

518
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,040
conquer our capital so easily, right?

519
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,680
We should cause them some troubles.

520
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,040
Young Master,

521
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,070
the people are all gathered.

522
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,000
OK.

523
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,830
Let’s go.

524
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:52,640
Mom,

525
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,520
will we come back soon?

526
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,280
Yes,

527
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,830
we will come back.

528
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:08,800
Young Master,

529
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:09,760
you leave first.

530
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,430
I will bring up the rear.

531
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,230
General Shu,

532
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,350
you leave first.

533
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,400
I bring up the rear,

534
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,470
or there will be a mess

535
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,230
in the people.

536
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,710
And,

537
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,710
take care of Your Lady in the future.

538
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,230
Don’t worry,

539
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,560
I will protect Young Lady.

540
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,160
Mu Chen,

541
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,230
let’s go.

542
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,710
You leave first.

543
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,350
I will be there soon.

544
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,880
You didn’t plan to leave.

545
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,680
You want to stay here alone.

546
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,040
If Liu Qingtian can easily capture the Capital,

547
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,470
he will have plenty of time to search.

548
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,830
The residents need time to retreat.

549
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,430
The longer I stay here,

550
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,040
the safer they will be.

551
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,590
If you stay,

552
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,590
I will stay as well.

553
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,190
Luo Li!

554
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,400
When I asked you to leave me,

555
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,230
you didn’t.

556
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,710
Now,

557
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,470
I won’t leave you here alone either.

558
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,160
Luo Li,

559
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,560
sorry that I lied to you.

560
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,430
But I don’t want you be in danger.

561
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,190
The people of Mu Territory

562
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,430
are up to you now.

563
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,950
Ruler.

564
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:47,950
Guys,

565
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,710
how is it going?

566
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,070
The soldiers are all gathered.

567
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,560
If you give the order,

568
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,430
we are ready to attack the city.

569
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,800
If we take down the Mu’s Capital,

570
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,430
Mu Territory will lose its main force.

571
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:00,230
Then it will be soon for us to conquer Mu Territory.

572
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:01,880
Liu Yang,

573
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,590
why do you look worried today?

574
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,760
Uncle,

575
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,560
Mubai has been missing

576
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,070
since we set off.

577
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,160
He is supposed to be present

578
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,110
at today's meeting.

579
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,830
But why didn’t he show up?

580
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:15,800
Guys,

581
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,830
I have my own arrangement about Mubai.

582
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,230
I worried too much.

583
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,830
Please forgive my rudeness.

584
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,640
I know

585
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,680
that war is coming.

586
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,680
Young Master’s absence will effect

587
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,040
the soldiers’ morale.

588
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,800
But the masters of Mu have been away.

589
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,070
There must be a mess in Mu’s Capital.

590
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,070
There will be

591
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,310
no problem to conquer it.

592
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:41,920
Ruler, we will take down the Capital.

593
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,160
Good.

594
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,070
Report!

595
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,310
Ruler,

596
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,950
the gate of Mu’s the Capital is opened suddenly.

597
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,160
They give up resisting?

598
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,470
Ruler,

599
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,470
what do you plan to do?

600
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,560
To be on the safe side,

601
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,830
send a squad to check it first.

602
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:07,920
Uncle,

603
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,040
I’m willing to do that.

604
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:11,110
Mu colluded with the Dragon Clan to kill my father.

605
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:14,070
I want to revenge for my father.

606
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,680
It’s dangerous on the battle field.

607
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,040
If something bad happens to you,

608
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,640
what about your mother?

609
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,880
It’s also my mom’s wish

610
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,000
to revenge for my father.

611
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,350
Please let me.

612
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:24,950
You…

613
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,280
Mr. Liu,

614
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,070
Liu Yang is being filial.

615
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:31,680
Please let him.

616
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,110
Liu Yang, take the order.

617
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,110
Yes!

618
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,040
Mu Chen!

619
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,040
Lucky that I can see an acquaintance now.

620
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,040
Mu Feng killed my father.

621
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,680
I will kill his son!

622
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:06,920
Mu Chen!

623
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,590
He wants to fight against the Liu’s army

624
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,400
with his own power.

625
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,560
Young Lady!

626
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,710
Where are you going?

627
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,000
Young Lady?

628
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,520
Young Master send you with us

629
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,110
to protect your safety.

630
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,230
You can’t go back there

631
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,590
before I go back.

632
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,590
Guards!

633
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,430
Wait.

634
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,430
General,

635
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,110
listen to me and stay here

636
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,350
to protect the people.

637
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,710
There are so many people here.

638
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,400
They need your help.

639
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,000
But I can’t wait and see Young Master…

640
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:37,760
General,

641
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,880
if you really regard me of Young Lady,

642
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,160
then stay here.

643
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:43,560
Yes.

644
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:45,430
Young Lady,

645
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,070
we’ll head back to Capital
after the people are settled down

646
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:48,950
and help Young Master.

647
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,680
OK.

648
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:51,950
Ruler,

649
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,000
we were ambushed.

650
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,040
Our soldiers…

651
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:55,760
Where is Liu Yang?

652
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,040
General Liu…

653
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,310
Uncle,

654
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,430
I’m sorry.

655
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,430
You’re not to blame.

656
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,710
How many people are there?

657
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,310
I only saw Mu Chen.

658
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,160
Only him?

659
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,350
Go have a rest.

660
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,190
Yes.

661
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,520
There can’t be any force in Mu now.

662
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,040
But it must be a trap

663
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,830
if there is only one man.

664
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,800
Guards!

665
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:29,880
Ruler.

666
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,190
Give my order

667
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,680
to gather the war magicians

668
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,880
and make the Great Magic.

669
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,880
Attack the city!

670
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,560
Mr. Liu,

671
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,310
there is only Mu Chen in the Capital.

672
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,590
When the Great Magic is made,

673
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,760
it won’t be long

674
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,830
before we take down the Capital.

675
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,120
We already start to use the Great Magic

676
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:12,040
while there is only Mu Chen.

677
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:14,429
If their main force didn’t leave,

678
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,469
I’m afraid we can’t take down it.

679
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:19,080
I don’t know how great the power they

680
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,870
have accumulated is.

681
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,280
No matter how great Mu Feng is,

682
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:25,710
his soldiers

683
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,520
are all only normal ones.

684
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:31,280
Besides, you have me to help you.

685
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,600
You don’t need to worry.

686
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,000
Of course.

687
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,280
We all know your great power.

688
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,360
With your help,

689
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,710
we don’t need to fear

690
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,230
the army of the Mu.

691
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,360
Jiuyou!

692
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,150
Jiuyou!

693
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,000
Jiuyou!

694
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,000
Jiuyou!

695
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:01,870
What?

696
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,710
You scared me!

697
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,670
The enemy is coming.

698
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,840
Why did you come now?

699
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:05,840
I have something to discuss with you.

700
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,910
You need my help, right?

701
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,430
Liu used the Great Magic to attack.

702
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,600
The City Protection Circle can’t hold on for long.

703
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,120
I want to use my power to supply it.

704
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:11,950
But my power is not enough.

705
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,430
I won’t help.

706
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,390
Jiuyou,

707
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,230
we’re connected to live or die together.

708
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,390
If you don’t help me,

709
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,910
you will also be in trouble.

710
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:18,870
Why should I help you?

711
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,320
Don’t threat me with that.

712
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,470
Why don’t you escape?

713
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I can’t!

714
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,950
Everyone can escape. Why can’t you do that?

715
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,950
How could you

716
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,390
keep the City Protection Circle on your own?

717
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,390
You'll never know without a try.

718
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,320
Wait for me.

719
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,430
Report!

720
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:48,800
Ruler.

721
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:49,360
How is it?

722
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,150
The Circle hasn’t been destroyed.

723
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:51,800
Give my order.

724
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,760
Increase the power output to
break through the City Protection Circle!

725
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,190
Yes!

726
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,710
Are you alright?

727
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,670
Haven’t died yet!

728
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,430
Who is that?

729
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,430
Ruler.

730
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,120
General Shu,

731
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,150
why are you here?

732
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,230
We wanted to go back to the Capital after

733
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,600
we were sent out by Young Master.

734
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,670
But we didn't expect that
Liu Qingtian's encirclement was too tight.

735
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,000
We tried several times

736
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,360
and couldn't break through.

737
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,280
But Young Lady is skilled.

738
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,230
She sneaked in alone first.

739
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:00,950
Young Lady?

740
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,360
It’s Miss Luo Li.

741
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:03,150
How is Chen now?

742
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,600
After he sent us out,

743
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,280
he has been protecting the city alone.

744
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,280
Alone?

745
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:11,950
No.

746
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,190
With his temper,

747
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,520
he will keep fighting till death.

748
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,630
We can’t go back through the Transmitting Circle.

749
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:16,470
No.

750
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,390
We have tried these days.

751
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,120
The Transmitting Circle is closed.

752
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,150
Mr. Mu,

753
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,080
let me help you

754
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:26,470
to go back.

755
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,710
Mr. Mu,

756
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,360
how about we hurry up

757
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,390
and go to the city

758
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,760
to save Mu Chen tonight.

759
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:32,670
No.

760
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,230
The war magicians

761
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,390
need to rest at night.

762
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,280
The whole army is on the alert.

763
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,630
If we make a scene,

764
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,910
it will cause a situation.

765
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:40,710
That’s right.

766
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,670
The war will start tomorrow morning.

767
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:46,430
At that time, the defense will be relaxed.

768
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,320
It will be a good chance to sneak in.

769
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,390
General Shu.

770
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,120
Master.

771
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:50,560
Listen,

772
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,600
when we go save Chen,

773
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,840
Liu Qingtian will badger with us.

774
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,520
You can take the chance to attack

775
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,120
and capture the leader.

776
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,390
Get me the map.

777
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,360
Look.

778
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,430
I really don't understand.

779
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,870
Why are you defending

780
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:14,840
an empty city?

781
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:15,600
For my people.

782
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,320
Mu’s Capital

783
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:18,560
is the heart of Mu Territory. If we lose it,

784
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,040
the whole territory will be done.

785
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:21,430
So I will do whatever I can do

786
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:22,760
to protect this city.

787
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,470
We can get back the city,

788
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,950
but the life can’t return from death.

789
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,430
You said this yourself.

790
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,630
If you want to shield the people,

791
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,800
you have been doing that long enough.

792
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:30,950
We should go now.

793
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,150
If Liu Qingtian conquers the Capital,

794
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,600
he will take the Capital of as a stronghold

795
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,190
and quickly raid other cities.

796
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,000
At that time,

797
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,600
more cities will be lost

798
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,600
and more people will be in danger.

799
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,190
The only thing we can do now

800
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,430
is to hold them back

801
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,870
and wait for my dad to bring reinforcements back.

802
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,000
When your father comes back,

803
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,150
you will already be dead.

804
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,320
Liu Mubai said he would inform my dad.

805
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,280
He will go.

806
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,040
I believe that he will stop this plot,

807
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,360
and my father

808
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,630
will come with the reinforcement in time.

809
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,320
Such an idiot!

810
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,520
You said you didn’t want to help me.

811
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:21,910
I’m not helping you.

812
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,230
I just don’t want to die with you.

813
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,390
Thank you,

814
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,040
Jiuyou.

815
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,150
Save it.

816
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:31,910
Report!

817
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,080
Is the City Protection Circle broken?

818
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,760
It was broken at first,

819
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,430
and the Great Magic has taken down the barrier.

820
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,230
But a purple power showed up suddenly

821
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,910
and fixed up the barrier.

822
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,560
Purple power?

823
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,840
What is that?

824
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:46,040
It can’t be from normal person.

825
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:49,470
It seems that there is not only Mu Chen.

826
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,630
What to do now?

827
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,760
Don’t worry.

828
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,000
Let the magicians keep attacking.

829
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,760
Master,

830
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,840
won’t you help me?

831
00:39:57,230 --> 00:40:00,280
This is the first battle for Liu to
dominate the Beiling.

832
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:01,910
If I help you,

833
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,230
even if you win,

834
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,230
how will you build your prestige
and command the people?

835
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:07,670
Give my order.

836
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,560
Keep attacking!

837
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,150
We should take the city down today!

838
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:21,630
Jiuyou,

839
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,520
are you alright?

840
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,080
Shut up.

841
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,190
Don’t distract me.

842
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,710
We did it!

843
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:47,630
Jiuyou?

844
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,000
Jiuyou!

845
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:54,230
Jiuyou!

846
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:56,870
Jiuyou!

847
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,280
Jiuyou!
