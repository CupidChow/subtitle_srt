1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,070
What do you want to do?

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,800
I’m going to get

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,760
Jiuyou Spirit Blood.

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:21,950
Stand up.

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,360
Come with me.

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,110
We got through thick and thin with Jiuyou.

8
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,840
How can you hurt her?

9
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,360
I’m your guard.

10
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,000
Your safety is my only concern.

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,360
Do you know

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,840
Mu Chen and Jiuyou are bound by blood?

13
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:48,470
If you kill Jiuyou,

14
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,470
Mu Chen will die, too.

15
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,080
I know.

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,680
Mu Chen helped you many times

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,360
and also saved our lives.

18
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,430
For the sake of Goddess,

19
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,630
I’m willing to be wicked.

20
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,560
Goddess, rest assured.

21
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,080
After I give you

22
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,840
Jiuyou Spirit Blood,

23
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,590
I’ll kill myself in front of you

24
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,830
to redeem myself.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,480
For you,

26
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:09,510
I would do anything.

27
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,120
I don’t want Jiuyou Spirit Blood.

28
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,630
I don’t want you to die.

29
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,039
I don’t want

30
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,550
anything happen to Mu Chen, either.

31
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,230
If he gets killed,

32
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,039
I won’t live either.

33
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,080
OK.

34
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,440
I see.

35
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,910
Xuantong.

36
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,039
We grew up together.

37
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,479
You know,

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,310
my parents died when I was little.

39
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,310
In Luo City,

40
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,590
besides my grandpa,

41
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,950
you care about me the most.

42
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,800
I’ve always seen you as my brother.

43
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,240
If you want,

44
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,600
don’t call me Goddess anymore.

45
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,800
I’d like to be

46
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,160
your sworn sister.

47
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:59,900
The Great Ruler

48
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,780
Episode 29

49
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,670
OK.

50
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,200
Being Goddess’s sworn brother

51
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,950
is my bliss.

52
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:48,760
May Heaven witness:

53
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,350
May Heaven witness:

54
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,760
I, Li Xuantong, swear to be Luo Li’s brother.

55
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,720
I, Luo Li, swear to be Li Xuantong’s sister.

56
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:54,790
We share weal and woe.

57
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,510
We share weal and woe.

58
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:56,550
In the lifetime,

59
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,230
In the lifetime,

60
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,350
I will never break the oath.

61
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:58,950
I will never break the oath.

62
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,110
Brother.

63
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,390
Goddess.

64
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,440
Don’t call me Goddess.

65
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,070
Call me Luo Li.

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,480
OK.

67
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,550
Luo Li.

68
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,640
I’m going back first.

69
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,350
OK.

70
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,159
Jiuyou.

71
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,790
You are...

72
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,000
Get away.

73
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,320
Hey,

74
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,350
don’t you want my Spirit Blood?

75
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,159
Jiuyou.

76
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,790
Stop!

77
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,510
It’s a misunderstanding.

78
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,640
I won’t hurt you.

79
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,920
I believe you.

80
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,480
If you meant to hurt me,

81
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,640
you’d have done it

82
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,830
in White Horse City.

83
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,510
This is Spirit Blood you’ve dreamed of.

84
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,200
Take it.

85
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,159
I can’t.

86
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,110
If you give me,

87
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,159
you’ll die.

88
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,230
Take it.

89
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,720
If something happens to you,

90
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,230
Mu Chen may kill himself, too.

91
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,070
I’ll also be implicated.

92
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,110
What’s more,

93
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,790
I’m the descendant of Phoenix.

94
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,390
It’s not a big deal for me.

95
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,760
I’ll recover soon.

96
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,270
No way.

97
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,070
To take the Spirit Blood,

98
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,830
the beast must be killed.

99
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:14,920
It’s common sense.

100
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,160
Nonsense.

101
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,480
Am I dead now?

102
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,830
After Spirit Blood is taken,

103
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,000
the beast’s life will be greatly impaired.

104
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,760
No one will offer it to others

105
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,670
like a fool.

106
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
That’s why it’s rumored

107
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,760
beasts must be killed first.

108
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:30,550
Thank you.

109
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,550
I’m guilty.

110
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,760
Sorry

111
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,159
for that.

112
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,070
Forget it.

113
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,720
Since you confessed,

114
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:43,830
you are much better than most of Gods.

115
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,270
Jiuyou.

116
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,390
Thank you.

117
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,590
Qian’er.

118
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,080
Restoring the pulse and soul

119
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,150
can bring life back,

120
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
yet whoever casts the spell

121
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,080
will destroy all their own power pulses,

122
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,710
and even die.

123
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,200
Qian’er.

124
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,790
Qian’er.

125
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:58,440
Qian’er.

126
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,030
Qian’er.

127
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,470
Don’t die. Qian’er.

128
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,760
Qian’er.

129
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,640
Don’t die. Qian’er.

130
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,080
Qian’er.

131
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,790
Qian’er.

132
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,200
Mubai.

133
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,150
Qian’er.

134
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,880
They all said

135
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,520
you were dead.

136
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,080
I didn’t believe it.

137
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,440
You are silly.

138
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,030
You gave your pulse to me.

139
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,110
You would die. You know that?

140
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,110
I know.

141
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,000
But only in this way

142
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
can you be saved.

143
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,590
I’m not worth it.

144
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,550
Mubai.

145
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,710
Go back to the Sect with me.

146
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,590
I’ve been like this.

147
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,350
How can I go back?

148
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,640
You become like this

149
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,790
for protecting the Sect.

150
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,960
You are the hero of the Sect.

151
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,710
We’ll

152
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,960
try to heal you.

153
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,230
Hero?

154
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,440
Who said that?

155
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,840
Mu Chen.

156
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,400
I’m no hero.

157
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,590
To get power,

158
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,710
I joined Evil Deity.

159
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,710
I lied to you

160
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,910
about He Yao.

161
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,080
I killed Zhu Tian,

162
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,440
and also Huo Feng.

163
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,520
Shen Cangsheng was also injured by me.

164
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,030
I came to White Horse City

165
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,030
not to help Mu Chen,

166
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,520
but to kill him.

167
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,030
Because of him,

168
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,400
my father was gone,

169
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,670
and also Liu Territory.

170
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,000
Everything is gone.

171
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,960
How come you still trust him?

172
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,080
Why?

173
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,550
Why?

174
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,790
I can’t accept that.

175
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,350
Now you know, you saved

176
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,440
a villain,

177
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,320
an accomplice of Evil Deity.

178
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,110
I saved my husband.

179
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,590
We’ve held the wedding.

180
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:47,760
I’m sorry.

181
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,880
Many houses were ruined in the Sect.

182
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,150
The Protection Circle was also damaged.

183
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,590
This is the scroll of the Protection Circle.

184
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,400
Let’s split up

185
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,280
and restore it as soon as possible.

186
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,960
Sun’er.

187
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,470
You are adept at formations.

188
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:21,840
Take charge of it.

189
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,350
OK.

190
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,110
Qingling.

191
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,320
Send some men

192
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,440
to patrol in the Sect,

193
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,880
lest spies get into the Sect.

194
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,230
OK.

195
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,640
Hasn’t Ms. Mu come?

196
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,520
Since the headmaster passed away,

197
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,200
Ms. Mu’s been depressed.

198
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,110
She regarded the headmaster as example.

199
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,320
It’s hard for her

200
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,350
to get it over.

201
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,320
I know.

202
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,320
Headmaster.

203
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,790
I’ll come to see you tomorrow.

204
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,760
Are you unhappy again?

205
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,280
No, I am not.

206
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,030
Liar.

207
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,520
What’s this?

208
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,760
You look unhappy.

209
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:02,910
Take it for fun.

210
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,790
What is it?

211
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,080
It is

212
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,000
Double-winged White Horse,

213
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,030
the symbol of White Horse’s wisdom.

214
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,440
Our White Horse City

215
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,200
specializes in machinery manufacture.

216
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,110
When I was unhappy back then,

217
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,400
my father made

218
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,280
the same one to me.

219
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,400
You look unhappy lately,

220
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,080
so I made one for you.

221
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,640
I wish

222
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,960
you could forget all the unhappiness

223
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,960
when you see it.

224
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,550
Indeed.

225
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,440
I am not that upset now.

226
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,670
Thanks.

227
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,550
I...

228
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,840
Actually...

229
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,790
I like the way you smile.

230
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,440
When you’re happy,

231
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,150
I feel happy, too.

232
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,350
Bai Tong.

233
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,400
Do you like me?

234
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,200
Yes,

235
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,760
I like you.

236
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,280
Jiuyou.

237
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,040
Mubai.

238
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,589
Look.

239
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,310
I found this.

240
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,589
Wait a while.

241
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,710
I’ll cook it for you.

242
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:19,640
OK.

243
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,400
Let me.

244
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,400
Take it.

245
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,350
Take it.

246
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,710
I’m disabled now.

247
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,590
It’s useless for me.

248
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,710
And

249
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,950
I don’t deserve it anymore.

250
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:41,560
Never mind.

251
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,110
I’ll do it.

252
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,000
Sorry.

253
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,110
I’m useless.

254
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,590
Don't say that.

255
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,520
You are badly injured.

256
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,310
It takes time to recover.

257
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,190
You shouldn’t have wasted your power pulse on me.

258
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,280
Say no more.

259
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,070
You’ll be fine.

260
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,070
Someone is here.

261
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,430
Let's go.

262
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:48,800
Mubai.

263
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,470
I didn’t find your body.

264
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,280
Sorry.

265
00:20:54,420 --> 00:21:02,780
[Grave of Liu Mubai]

266
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,470
I’m supposed to

267
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,470
take your fan back.

268
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,190
But I think

269
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,430
it’s better leave it to you.

270
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,190
And

271
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,470
my father asked me

272
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,350
to tell you

273
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:09,680
he will

274
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,640
take good care of Liu Territory for you.

275
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,430
The lord will only be a Liu.

276
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,190
As for Qian’er,

277
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,800
I’ll help you

278
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,400
choose her groom.

279
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,590
I will marry her to a good man.

280
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,000
And I...

281
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,070
Liu Mubai, you fool!

282
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,430
You died this way?

283
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,070
You died like this?

284
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,470
Didn’t you want to be stronger?

285
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,710
Didn’t you want to beat Evil Deity

286
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,310
and renew Liu Territory?

287
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,230
You left all these behind and died?

288
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,760
How come you believed their nonsense?

289
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,040
If I found it out earlier,

290
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,070
everything could've been fine.

291
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,070
Mubai.

292
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,920
I’ve told Qian’er you were dead.

293
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,470
She didn’t believe it at all.

294
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,800
She left the Sect without permission.

295
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,680
I thought she came to White Horse City,

296
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,070
yet I didn’t find her.

297
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,710
But don’t worry.

298
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,430
I will find Qian'er for you.

299
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,310
I will come here to see you often.

300
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:08,620
[Grave of Liu Mubai]

301
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,400
That Liu Mubai

302
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,430
has died.

303
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,680
Mubai.

304
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,760
Where shall we go?

305
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,590
Qian’er.

306
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,040
You don’t have to be with me.

307
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,800
It’s unfair to you.

308
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,760
I’m disabled now.

309
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,280
And

310
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,760
I’m affected by Evil Deity’s Power of Whisper.

311
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,760
I’m unable to protect you.

312
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,710
Mubai.

313
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,110
What do you mean?

314
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,430
You want to leave me alone?

315
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,310
I will be your burden.

316
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,640
I don’t care.

317
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,760
I only want to be with you.

318
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,350
You should go home.

319
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,350
No.

320
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:27,760
Fine.

321
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,230
Let’s go to your home

322
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,710
together.

323
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,190
OK.

324
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,160
What’s wrong?

325
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,000
Mubai.

326
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,280
You wake up.

327
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,470
What happened?

328
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,760
Ironically,

329
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,710
all my power is lost,

330
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,560
but Evil Deity’s Power of Whisper

331
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,040
is still in my body.

332
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,040
Mubai, it’s fine.

333
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,040
Let’s go.

334
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,760
We’re arriving at Tang Territory.

335
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,280
Seems the deputy headmaster of North Sect

336
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,640
isn’t that capable.

337
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,190
Headmaster,

338
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,470
you died for the Sect.

339
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,760
I wish I could still take your lessons.

340
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,190
How is it,

341
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,230
Deputy Headmaster Mu Ling?

342
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,760
Is my tongue like yours?

343
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,160
Sun’er.

344
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,470
The damaged house

345
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:21,310
has been repaired.

346
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:23,400
So soon?

347
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,830
That was quick.

348
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,400
Just some unskilled work.

349
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,830
Leave it to me.

350
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,590
Next

351
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:31,830
it’s up to you.

352
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:55,310
Sun’er.

353
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,520
You are a genius.

354
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:01,110
Unstoppable!

355
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,590
Wrong. It should be ‘unbelievable’.

356
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:07,470
Let’s go.

357
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,040
Next house.

358
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,520
Ms. Mu.

359
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,040
You come out finally.

360
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,880
Yes.

361
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,520
Headmaster is gone,

362
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,710
but the Sect survives.

363
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,310
Protecting the Sect

364
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:24,160
is the best respect to headmaster.

365
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,190
You thought it through.

366
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,430
That’s the best.

367
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,310
By the way,

368
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,590
do you know

369
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,040
where Mu Chen is?

370
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,520
Mu Chen?

371
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,310
Ms. Mu.

372
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,880
Don’t you know it?

373
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,230
I’ve been

374
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,160
in the room lately.

375
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,070
I don't know anything.

376
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,590
Mu Chen

377
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,830
left the Sect long ago.

378
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,830
Did he?

379
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,160
Where did he go?

380
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,000
Mu Chen...

381
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,000
Ms. Mu.

382
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,640
What's the matter for Mu Chen?

383
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,680
Nothing important.

384
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,920
A casual question.

385
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:04,160
Sun’er.

386
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,310
What’s wrong?

387
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,590
Don’t you think Ms. Mu is

388
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:10,760
kind of weird?

389
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,000
Mu Chen isn’t here.

390
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,160
A beast is in Mu Chen’s body.

391
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:42,310
They may have signed life-and-death contract.

392
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,560
Are you asking for me?

393
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,830
I return it to you.

394
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,870
Why?

395
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,120
I’ve given it to you. It’s yours.

396
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,469
I can’t take it.

397
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,710
So,

398
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:15,870
I return it to you.

399
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,080
It’s

400
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,000
just a toy.

401
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,280
But

402
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:28,080
you gave me because you like me.

403
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:29,000
Right?

404
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,080
I can’t take it.

405
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,280
Why?

406
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:35,710
If it’s in the name

407
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,469
of a friend,

408
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,320
I will accept it.

409
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,389
You like me,

410
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:43,389
so I can’t have it.

411
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:46,800
Because of

412
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,080
Mu Chen?

413
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,320
It has nothing to do with him.

414
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,600
Because

415
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,909
I don’t like you.

416
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,040
I don’t mean I hate you.

417
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,040
I only regard you as a friend.

418
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:03,390
If you insist in liking me,

419
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,760
we can’t be friends

420
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,520
anymore.

421
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:17,600
Take it,

422
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,470
in the name of friend.

423
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:22,600
Bai Tong.

424
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,600
You don’t have to do this.

425
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,630
I have few friends

426
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,670
in White Horse City.

427
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,080
Just

428
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,560
take it.

429
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,150
Where are you going?

430
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,120
I’ll

431
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,230
practice in the mountain.

432
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,670
Wait for me!

433
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,950
I’m going with you.

434
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,230
Mubai.

435
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,910
Don’t!

436
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:11,910
Do you think I’d kill him?

437
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,560
Mu Chen.

438
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,560
You made the grave for me,

439
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,430
and I saved you.

440
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,230
From now on,

441
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,190
our feud

442
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,150
is settled once for all.

443
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,280
In this world,

444
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,840
there's no Liu Mubai anymore.

445
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,000
Mu Chen.

446
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:55,670
Farewell.

447
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,230
I prefer this place

448
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,470
than the Sect.

449
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,600
Why?

450
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,150
The environment here

451
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,280
is what nature is.

452
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,190
I like this kind of environment.

453
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:25,840
What’s wrong?

454
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,150
Someone is here.

455
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,560
Easy.

456
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,430
It’s me.

457
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,150
Ms. Mu Ling.

458
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,320
Why are you here?

459
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,190
I came to relax.

460
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,230
Walk around.

461
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,120
The Sect reminds me

462
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,870
of the headmaster easily.

463
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,040
Headmaster Ling Xi died.

464
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,080
Don’t be too sad.

465
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,320
Don’t be sad?

466
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,190
Easy said than done.

467
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:00,670
Fine.

468
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,150
Excuse me.

469
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:14,840
Bai Tong!

470
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,670
Brat.

471
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,520
It’s vigilant of you.

472
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:19,800
Who are you?

473
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,120
You are not Mu Ling!

474
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,760
I am going to kill you.

475
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,470
What’s wrong, Sun’er?

476
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,040
In this hall,

477
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,150
a strange power

478
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,230
seems to exist.

479
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,360
It’s weird indeed.

480
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:00,870
I’ll check it with Power-detecting Circle.

481
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,560
Not long ago,

482
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,280
a fight occurred here.

483
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,840
Power of Whisper!

484
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:22,280
Power of Whisper exists here.

485
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,520
Let’s tell Mr. Shen.

486
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:25,190
OK.

487
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,230
Bai Tong.

488
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,840
Too bad. Mu Chen isn’t here.

489
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,630
I can’t kill him.

490
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,560
Never mind.

491
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:55,080
When I kill you little sparrow,

492
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:57,040
Mu Chen will die, too.

493
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,710
I’ll take

494
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,710
your power pulse.

495
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,560
Let me see how long you can hold.
