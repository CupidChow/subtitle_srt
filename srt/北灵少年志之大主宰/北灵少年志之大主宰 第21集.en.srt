00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,000
Headmaster,

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:09,680
Liu Mubai framed me.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,840
I’ll let that slide

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,800
but we must get rid of the mole,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,600
or our sect will be doomed.

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,000
Please, Headmaster.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:31,680
Mubai,

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,150
what do you have to say?

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,680
Tell us.

11
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,000
Take Liu Mubai into custody,

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,360
pending sentence.

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,520
Headmaster,

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,430
Liu Mubai set up the teleporting formation

15
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,470
and murdered Zhu Tian. It's irrefutable.

16
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,040
He shall be executed now

17
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,910
so that Zhu Tian will rest in peace.

18
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,760
The war is coming.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,910
Death is a bad omen.

20
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,510
For the sake of the sect,

21
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,000
we’ll discuss this later.

22
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:31,590
Take him away.

23
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,360
-Yes.
-Yes.

24
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,910
This teleporting formation is strange.

25
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,550
The center and stones are placed unusually.

26
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,120
Headmaster,

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,400
I love studying all kinds of formations.

28
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,160
Allow me to have a look.

29
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,750
If Black Dragon and his force break in,

30
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:32,470
that’ll be catastrophic.

31
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,880
Headmaster,

32
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,030
this matter...

33
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,160
It can wait.

34
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:40,470
You may leave now.

35
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:32,220
The Great Ruler

36
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,180
Episode 21

37
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,880
Ling Xi is stubborn.

38
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,200
She still doesn’t believe Liu Mubai is guilty.

39
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:44,950
Sir,

40
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,550
isn’t Liu Mubai in custody

41
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,159
according to Headmaster’s order?

42
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,040
Idiot!

43
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,550
Use your brain!

44
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,230
Sir,

45
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,440
I’m too dumb

46
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,350
to connect the dots.

47
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,720
In the war,

48
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,830
if there’s a traitor on our side,

49
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,040
what should we do?

50
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Have him beheaded, of course.

51
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,110
Why didn’t Ling Xi kill Liu Mubai?

52
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,510
She said death is a bad omen

53
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,830
before the war.

54
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,160
You believe that?

55
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,600
It seems that

56
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,040
Ling Xi is punishing Liu Mubai,

57
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,790
but actually, she’s protecting him.

58
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,440
She can say the killer has been arrested

59
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,040
to stabilize the force,

60
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,000
and buy herself more time

61
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,040
to investigate it after the war.

62
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,920
I see.

63
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,440
But he’s been imprisoned...

64
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,000
Tell me,

65
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,760
what kind of people won’t talk?

66
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,230
Dead people.

67
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,159
Yes.

68
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,670
Once Liu Mubai is dead,

69
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,350
there will be no witness

70
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,550
and he’ll be the one to blame.

71
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,350
Problem is,

72
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,200
now he’s in prison

73
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,440
with guards outside.

74
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,160
It’s much more difficult to silence him.

75
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,270
On top of that,

76
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,270
he won’t be killed in the war

77
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,670
since he can’t get out.

78
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,000
I didn’t think any of that.

79
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,160
Lesson learned.

80
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,040
Other than Ling Xi,

81
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,640
that Shen Cangsheng

82
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,350
also tries to prove Liu Mubai’s innocence.

83
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,600
Luckily, I have leverage.

84
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:44,040
Liu Mubai did deliver the stone.

85
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,550
As long as I stick to my story,

86
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,230
Liu Mubai can’t pin it on me.

87
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,920
Alright.

88
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,270
Let’s just wait and see.

89
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:13,950
Qian’er,

90
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,070
I have Headmaster’s order.

91
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,350
You can’t be in for too long.

92
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,070
Thanks.

93
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,350
Mubai,

94
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,550
are you alright?

95
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,600
How come everyone calls you a mole?

96
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,950
What on earth happened?

97
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,950
Do you believe me?

98
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,640
I do.

99
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,390
Why...

100
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,350
Why didn’t you defend yourself?

101
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,040
Defend myself?

102
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,480
What’s the use of that?

103
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,720
Who’d believe me,

104
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,070
a down and out heir?

105
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,320
No.

106
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,830
Mr. Zhu Tian’s death,

107
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,040
the theft of the Space Stone,

108
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,040
and the construction of the teleporting formation

109
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,440
have nothing to do with you.

110
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,830
You found something?

111
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:57,920
Mubai,

112
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,110
you can tell me everything.

113
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,920
Say something.

114
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,830
I’ll prove your innocence.

115
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,760
You should leave.

116
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,760
I won’t.

117
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:08,920
Mubai.

118
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,320
Qian’er.

119
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,550
What happened?

120
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,920
Say it.

121
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:12,880
Let's go.

122
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,510
Answer my question!

123
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,760
Mubai,

124
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,510
I won’t leave.

125
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,110
Let’s go.

126
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,950
Mubai.

127
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,110
Mubai.

128
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,510
Come with me.

129
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,160
No!

130
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,920
Mubai.

131
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,110
Mubai.

132
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:25,950
Mubai.

133
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,160
Mubai.

134
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,880
Let go of me!

135
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:30,830
Mubai.

136
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:31,920
Mubai.

137
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,910
You're the mole!

138
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,470
We must get rid of the mole

139
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,400
so that Zhu Tian will rest in peace.

140
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,080
You're evil.

141
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,640
You lured us into the Dragon Palace to get killed.

142
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,280
I can’t believe you’re so heartless!

143
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,400
Headmaster,

144
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,960
I still don’t believe Liu Mubai would do that.

145
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:10,910
Cangsheng,

146
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,320
what makes you think

147
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,320
Liu Mubai is innocent?

148
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,000
During the Mu-Liu Battle,

149
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,520
he sacrificed his family

150
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,840
for justice.

151
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,080
That means he’s righteous.

152
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,960
He also stated

153
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,350
the teleporting formation could be rebuilt.

154
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,320
Were he the mole,

155
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,520
why would he tell us that?

156
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,960
Who do you think is the mole?

157
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:36,910
I...

158
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,080
I don’t know.

159
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,960
Right now,

160
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,200
only he has free access to our sect.

161
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,280
I gave him a chance to explain it,

162
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,030
but he didn’t say anything.

163
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,000
Perhaps...

164
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,470
Perhaps he did that for a reason.

165
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,000
What reason?

166
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,520
Is it worth it

167
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,470
to be called a mole?

168
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:01,790
Cangsheng,

169
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,150
I know you’re reluctant to admit

170
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,710
that Liu Mubai is our prime suspect,

171
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,080
but you once told me

172
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,320
that sometimes,

173
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,150
he acted strange.

174
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,440
Cangsheng,

175
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,520
I hope you can understand

176
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,640
that enemies are at the gate.

177
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,640
Whether he did it or not,

178
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,520
the public needs an answer,

179
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,320
or it’ll lower our morale

180
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,840
in war.

181
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,030
You have a point.

182
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,710
I didn’t think that much.

183
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,320
Don’t worry too much.

184
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,760
So far, there’s no evidence

185
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,840
against Liu Mubai.

186
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,590
He’s in custody for now,

187
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,640
pending further investigation after the war.

188
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,280
He won’t be wronged.

189
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,910
I’ll follow your order.

190
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,840
No objection at all.

191
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,080
We’re facing a war.

192
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,550
You’re the strongest we have.

193
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,350
Prepare yourself for it.

194
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,640
Rest assured.

195
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,790
I’ll guard the sect

196
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,110
with my life.

197
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,880
Mubai,

198
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,080
do you know

199
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,550
why I’m trying so hard to destroy Mu Territory?

200
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,710
It’s our biggest enemy.

201
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,760
Its existence

202
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,230
poses a threat to us.

203
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:50,080
Mu Feng is setting up the Devil-dissipating Circle

204
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,590
against Black Dragon,

205
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,350
but what if we're his real target?

206
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,520
-It’s not like that.
-Remember,

207
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,550
once you choose a path,

208
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,880
you must stick to it

209
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,150
to see the light of hope.

210
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,670
Liu Mubai,

211
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,790
as long as I can breathe,

212
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,030
you won’t be able to restore Liu Territory

213
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,840
and be the young master.

214
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,710
The king of the world

215
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:17,960
is me.

216
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:19,880
And you...

217
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,910
can only be my stepping stone.

218
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,640
No!

219
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,470
I’m ordered to interrogate Liu Mubai alone.

220
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,080
You two wait outside.

221
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,880
Yes.

222
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,840
Stop!

223
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,110
I’m here to help you.

224
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,200
I end up like this all because of you.

225
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,590
You came to help me?

226
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,520
Listen,

227
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,000
no one in the sect

228
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,640
believes you now.

229
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,350
Even if you can avoid death penalty,

230
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,350
you’ll be condemned to life imprisonment.

231
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:13,790
Mark my word.

232
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,150
Before I die,

233
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,080
I’ll drag you down with me.

234
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,320
Has it ever crossed your mind

235
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,400
that why those people

236
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,230
didn’t even give you a chance to explain?

237
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,550
Shen Cangsheng also has free access.

238
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,400
How come no one suspects him

239
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,640
but only you?

240
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,080
Actually,

241
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,840
we’re of the same kind.

242
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,080
If you agree

243
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,590
to serve Evil Deity with me,

244
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,200
I’ll get you out.

245
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,110
That’s also your only chance to rebuild your land.

246
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:57,960
Lord,

247
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,520
troops are ready to move.

248
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,710
We can launch the attack anytime.

249
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,000
Go on.

250
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,790
Bring back Mu Chen's head

251
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,710
for me.

252
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,400
Yes.

253
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,280
Pass my order!

254
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,280
Set out to Mount Beicang.

255
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:15,910
Yes.

256
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,320
Wen Qingxuan,

257
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,840
I’ve lent the village to you.

258
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,790
Can you tell me

259
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,280
your plan now?

260
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,590
Follow me.

261
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,550
There’s a teleporting formation

262
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,110
exactly like this in the North Sect.

263
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,350
This way,

264
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,760
we can sneak in

265
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,280
and ambush them.

266
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,790
How did you do this?

267
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,350
I have a mole inside.

268
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,760
I borrowed the village

269
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,710
to build the formation.

270
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,880
Since we have this,

271
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,640
why did you tell me to dispatch my troops?

272
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,840
You tricked me!

273
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,200
This formation

274
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,350
can’t teleport your entire force

275
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,320
but only a unit.

276
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,790
The North Sect is guarded

277
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,350
by the Protection Circle.

278
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,280
We must attack from inside and outside.

279
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,440
Wen Qingxuan,

280
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,640
you did a lot

281
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,110
behind my back.

282
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,880
I didn’t tell you

283
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,350
because the time wasn’t right.

284
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,200
We’re both working for godfather.

285
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,000
Once we succeed,

286
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,320
the credit

287
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,760
will all go to you.

288
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,520
Headmaster,

289
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:27,710
troops of the Dragon Palace

290
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,350
are attacking Sky Sect

291
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,110
and Phoenix Sect.

292
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,790
Sage and Knight Sects are suffering heavy losses.

293
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,550
Go help others

294
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,840
to fight against the enemies.

295
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:37,470
Yes.

296
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,320
Headmaster,

297
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,520
Mo Xingtian’s troop has arrived at Mount Beicang.

298
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,080
Dragon slaves are outside.

299
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,760
Prepare the formation.

300
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,150
Yes.

301
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,000
Ye Sun’er,

302
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,670
hold Position Kun.

303
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:03,550
Yes.

304
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:04,589
Ye Qingling,

305
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,230
hold Position Zhen.

306
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,109
Yes.

307
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:06,920
Mu Ling,

308
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,560
hold Position Xun.

309
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,069
Yes.

310
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:08,950
Tang Qian’er,

311
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,589
hold Position Kan.

312
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,310
Yes.

313
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,000
Form it!

314
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,950
Dementors.

315
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:57,590
Yes.

316
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,800
Form the circle.

317
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,350
Yes.

318
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,040
Headmaster,

319
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,800
We're besieged by dragon slaves.

320
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,760
We must do something.

321
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,280
If we don’t launch the attack,

322
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,640
we’ll be walking straight

323
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,560
into despair.

324
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,560
Cangsheng,

325
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,040
you can’t go out alone.

326
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,350
I’m going with you.

327
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,280
You can’t.

328
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,920
You still need to guard the Protection Circle.

329
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:04,800
I can handle it alone.

330
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,680
Once I’m out,

331
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,310
close the gate immediately.

332
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,950
You want to get in?

333
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,520
Tell Black Dragon to come here himself.

334
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,520
Lord,

335
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,070
we failed to break in.

336
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,350
The vanguard is suffering heavy losses.

337
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,590
It's about time.

338
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,040
Tell Mo Xingtian to withdraw

339
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,520
and break into the North Sect with my men.

340
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,350
Your men?

341
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,680
Lord of Xue God Clan,

342
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,680
Xue Lingzi has arrived.

343
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,230
Xue Lingzi?

344
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,160
Black Dragon,

345
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,470
if you’re in trouble,

346
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,230
I can help you.

347
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:02,520
Headmaster,

348
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,000
Mo Xingtian has retreated.

349
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,070
Attacks on the other four sects have paused.

350
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,680
Their retreat is only temporary.

351
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,470
Black Dragon hasn’t shown up.

352
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,000
Don’t lower your guard.

353
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,070
Yes.

354
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:15,880
Headmaster,

355
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,070
we can’t always stay in defense.

356
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,830
The best defense is a good offense.

357
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,800
Mu Chen is our only hope.

358
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,640
I can finally see you again.

359
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:25,880
Mu Chen.

360
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,070
I’m glad you're fine.

361
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:30,830
You ingrate.

362
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,000
I almost worked myself to death

363
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,110
because of you.

364
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,760
How could you forget about me so soon?

365
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,190
Jiuyou,

366
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,560
I’d never forget about you.

367
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,800
I remember everything

368
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,640
you’ve done for me.

369
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,070
That’s more like it.

370
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:46,950
Sir,

371
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,070
thank you so much.

372
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,310
No need to thank me.

373
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,830
You've recovered.

374
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,190
It's time for you to leave.

375
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,560
Don’t forget

376
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,710
to visit me often.

377
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,310
You still need to teach me magic tricks.

378
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:58,800
Deal.

379
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,310
What happened?

380
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,000
Is something wrong

381
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,110
with the Protection Circle?

382
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,920
Black Dragon

383
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,350
must’ve advanced the attack.

384
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,470
No way! Impossible!

385
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:13,110
I created that circle.

386
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,400
Even Black Dragon

387
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,590
can’t break it so soon.

388
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,110
Headmaster,

389
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,520
they're in!

390
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:55,950
Mu Ling!

391
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:57,950
Mu Ling!

392
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:32,800
The teleporting formation isn’t destroyed.

393
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:33,560
He Yao,

394
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,920
it’s you!

395
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,520
It’s too late

396
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,880
to figure that out.

397
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,950
Liu Mubai was right.

398
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,350
Even if that formation was destroyed,

399
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,350
the mole would rebuild it.

400
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,800
We all wronged Mubai.

401
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,280
Kill them all!

402
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,160
Join the battle.

403
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,160
I’ll guard the formation.

404
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,000
Headmaster!

405
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:02,710
No.

406
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:03,430
Qian'er,

407
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
let Liu Mubai out.

408
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:05,950
Yes.

409
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,110
Ms. Ye,

410
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,160
disconnect the teleporting formation.

411
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,590
Yes.

412
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:21,680
Mubai.

413
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,310
Here.

414
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,470
He Yao,

415
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,000
He Yao is the mole.

416
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,680
You’re innocent.

417
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:26,760
Let's go.

418
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:33,950
Stop!

419
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:41,590
Liu Mubai,

420
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,400
what are you doing?

421
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,190
No!

422
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,590
There's such a beauty

423
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,160
in the North Sect.

424
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,560
You look cute even with a sword.

425
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:04,560
Miss,

426
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,230
you’ve seen it yourself.

427
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,430
This place is almost ruined.

428
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,000
This day

429
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,710
will be the deathday of your sect.

430
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,310
But don’t be afraid.

431
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:17,110
You can go back with me

432
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,350
and be my wife.

433
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,880
I’ll treat you well.

434
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,880
You're shameless!

435
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,520
Sun’er.

436
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:27,830
Sorry,

437
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,400
I’m late.

438
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,350
You have to walk over my dead body

439
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,920
before taking her away.

440
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,190
You?

441
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:38,880
Yes.

442
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,800
I’ll crush you.

443
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,190
Fine.

444
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,760
It hurts!

445
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,190
Qian'er.

446
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,000
Qian'er.

447
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,230
Qian'er.

448
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,430
Qian'er.

449
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,350
Liu Mubai,

450
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,590
we’re on the same side.

451
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,640
You forgot how you got out?

452
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:46,680
You forgot

453
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:48,950
what you had done to me?

454
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,950
You're ungrateful.

455
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,710
You're to blame

456
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,040
for what’s happening.

457
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,680
You think once I’m dead,

458
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,920
you can cover up the truth?

459
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:12,950
You want to kill me?

460
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,680
Can you?

461
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:16,470
You had a way out

462
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,190
but you didn’t take it.

463
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,350
You had this coming.

464
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,640
You’re having what Zhu Tian had.

465
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,520
Sadly, no one will end your pain.

466
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,470
Killing you...

467
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,880
is purely personal.

468
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,520
Don’t worry.

469
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,560
I'll handle the rest

470
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,560
for you.

471
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,350
You...

472
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:08,710
animal!

473
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:44,800
Are you OK, Mubai?

474
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,470
I’m fine.

475
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,000
Come here.

476
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,560
Hold your positions.

477
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,000
I’ll go check on Cangsheng.

478
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,350
Yes.

479
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,160
Shen Cangsheng,

480
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,560
why can’t you leave me alone?

481
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:25,680
Mo Xingtian,

482
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,430
over the past decades,

483
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,830
you’ve killed countless men.

484
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,000
So many innocent people died in your hands.

485
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,920
Now, you dare break into our sect!

486
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,560
I can’t let you go.

487
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,070
Shen Cangsheng,

488
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,830
you’re highly skilled.

489
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,520
Why don’t you join me

490
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,230
to command dragon slaves together?

491
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,350
If we join hands,

492
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,400
we can conquer this sect,

493
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,880
as well as

494
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,470
Beiling.

495
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:54,950
In your dreams!

496
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:56,920
You're vicious

497
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,160
and foolishly naive.

498
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,710
Surrender now!

499
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,400
You've had your chance.

500
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,190
I’m forced to do this.

501
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:16,800
Stop, Cangsheng.

502
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,280
He’s...

503
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,760
Black Dragon hasn’t appeared.

504
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,389
We don’t know if he’s a bait.

505
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:22,870
Inform everyone

506
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:24,429
to retreat to the arena.

507
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,710
Stop.

508
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,280
Headmaster,

509
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,360
please save Mubai.

510
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,710
What happened to him?

511
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,190
He Yao poisoned him.

512
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,080
Where is He Yao?

513
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,360
Mubai killed him.

514
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,000
His symptom is similar to Zhu Tian’s.

515
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,840
He Yao is the real murderer.

516
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,040
Mubai,

517
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,520
sorry, I wronged you.

518
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:51,910
My power

519
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,950
can soothe you for now

520
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,430
but you still need the antidote.

521
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:57,760
Thank you, Headmaster.

522
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,000
Mubai,

523
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:00,560
you killed He Yao

524
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,670
and avenged Zhu Tian’s death.

525
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,080
We all wronged you.

526
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,280
Don’t say that.

527
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,190
Let him rest first.

528
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,520
Give me the antidote.

529
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,150
I didn’t poison him.

530
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,390
Why are you asking me for the antidote?

531
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,840
Stop pretending.

532
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,430
You’re on the same side.

533
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,430
Of course you have it.

534
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,000
Save your breath.

535
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,080
Kill me now.

536
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:29,670
Stop!

537
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:42,520
Sister.

538
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,800
Shouldn’t you check with me

539
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,390
before killing my man?

540
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:51,840
Xue Lingzi!

541
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:52,910
Let her go.

542
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,040
I don’t want to be your enemy.

543
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:56,760
Let’s change hostages.

544
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:02,600
Release him.

545
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,910
I’m fine, Leader.

546
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,840
There’s no hatred between us.

547
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,190
Give me Luo Li

548
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,470
and Mu Chen,

549
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,430
then I’ll leave.

550
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:31,430
They’re my students.

551
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,230
I can’t give them to you.

552
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,600
Are you sure?

553
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,280
Take him away.

554
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,190
Yes.

555
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:45,870
I can walk myself.

556
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:06,670
Interesting.

557
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,560
Let me try your Protection Circle.

558
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,230
Headmaster!

559
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,230
You do live up

560
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,230
to your reputation!

561
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,840
Hadn’t you

562
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,360
supported the circle

563
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,040
with all your power,

564
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,800
you wouldn’t have got injured.

565
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:40,710
Listen,

566
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,800
hand over Luo Li

567
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,320
and Mu Chen,

568
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,430
then you can survive.

569
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,000
Headmaster!

570
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,710
You've used too much power

571
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:54,950
supporting the Protection Circle.

572
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:56,520
You can’t fight again.

573
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,800
The Protection Circle can’t collapse.

574
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,040
Lord,

575
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,360
Ling Xi was heavily injured by Xue Lingzi.

576
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,280
Power of the Protection Circle is weakened.

577
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,670
Pass my order.

578
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,040
Follow me

579
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,840
to wipe out the North Sect.

580
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:17,360
Yes.

581
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:23,600
Everyone,

582
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,150
Black Dragon has left.

583
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:26,520
Our goal

584
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,280
is to get the dragon egg.

585
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:29,840
No fighting unless necessary.

586
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,190
After it’s done,

587
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,120
we’ll leave immediately.

588
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:32,870
Can this solve

589
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,670
North Sect’s crisis?

590
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:37,040
5,000 years ago,

591
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,040
few dragons survived in the war

592
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,080
other than Black Dragon and White Dragon.

593
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,670
This dragon egg is the key to their rejuvenation.

594
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,950
It means the world to Black Dragon.

595
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:48,950
Mr. Mo,

596
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,320
guard the entrance.

597
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,230
No.

598
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,360
I can’t let you take risks in the Dragon Palace

599
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,280
while I do nothing

600
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,520
other than waiting outside.

601
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,000
Look,

602
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,710
we’ll have to use our power

603
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:58,600
to sneak in.

604
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,800
You have more power than any of us.

605
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,710
We’ll need you to build a teleporting formation

606
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,950
once we're out

607
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:07,150
so that we can go back safe and sound.

608
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:08,800
If...

609
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,230
If we don’t come out

610
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,320
in an hour,

611
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,870
just leave without us.

612
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,360
Mu Feng...

613
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:43,870
Let's go.
