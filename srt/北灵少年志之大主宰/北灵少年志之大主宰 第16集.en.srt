1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available.]


2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,310
Mu Chen.


3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,110
Liu Mubai is inside, too.


4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,310
That's good.


5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:18,950
Qingshan,


6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,120
do you know


7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,470
what happened to Luo Li?


8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,310
How come we don’t have one class together?


9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,280
I don’t know.


10
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,120
I barely know her.


11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,150
Don’t worry about her.


12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,430
If you want,


13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,080
I can take you to look for her.


14
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:35,590
No need.


15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:45,840
Let's go.


16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,110
I won’t.


17
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,310
I can’t see.


18
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,150
Also,


19
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,400
what if Liu Mubai leaves


20
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:53,840
when he sees me?


21
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,430
Qingshan.


22
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,950
Get in now.


23
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,200
You may check for me


24
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,560
what happens there.


25
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,800
Hello, Ms. Ye.


26
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,680
Hello, Mr. He.


27
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:13,870
Seems that


28
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,360
you don’t want to see me, right?


29
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,590
We see you every day,


30
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,160
while we don’t see Mr. Shen often.


31
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,950
Cangsheng has been hunting outside.


32
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,480
He seldom comes back.


33
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,400
But I believe


34
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,160
his name is well-known.


35
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,360
I won’t waste time to introduce him.


36
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,400
Now,


37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,230
let’s welcome Shen Cangsheng.


38
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:04,660
The Great Ruler


39
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,620
Episode 16


40
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,160
War God Spear!


41
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,320
War God Spear!


42
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,390
Do you know


43
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,910
what’s the point of improving martial arts?


44
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,600
What?


45
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:31,079
You’ll know it soon.


46
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,670
The lesson today is simple.


47
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:36,390
Beat me.


48
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,270
Beat him?


49
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,470
That’s impossible!


50
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,390
4 in each group.


51
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,960
If you can’t take 10 strikes or more,


52
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,320
don’t bother show up tomorrow.


53
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,750
Let’s do it.


54
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,750
Xu Xiao.


55
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,030
Let’s team up.


56
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,360
We need two more.


57
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,079
Well.


58
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,910
You find one and I find another.


59
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,110
Mubai, would you join us?


60
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,720
Mubai.


61
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,360
Shen is the top master of the North Sect.


62
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,760
As for martial arts, none of us is his match.


63
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,000
If you


64
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,950
join us,


65
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,790
we have the chance to fight against him.


66
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,720
Disorganized. No morale at all.


67
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,670
Next.


68
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,480
Mubai.


69
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,000
I’ll join you.


70
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,880
Welcome.


71
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,270
Mu Chen.


72
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:33,950
Qingshan.


73
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,040
How was it going?


74
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,159
It’s so wonderful. Listen.


75
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,350
The four of us took more than twenty strikes.


76
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,550
My Mountain Palm...


77
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,320
Stop!


78
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,200
Cut it out.


79
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,230
I don’t care.


80
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,230
Tell me.


81
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,110
How is Liu Mubai now?


82
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,440
Liu Mubai


83
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,830
proposed a one on one,


84
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,720
yet Shen nailed him with one blow.


85
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,670
Then he used his Devil-sealing Fan instantly,


86
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,550
and Shen also used


87
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,320
his War God Spear.


88
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,070
Right at that moment,


89
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,720
they halted all of a sudden


90
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:26,760
and stood still.


91
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,230
Halted?


92
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,550
What happened?


93
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,040
I have no idea.


94
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,920
They just froze.


95
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,550
Li Xuantong said


96
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,070
they were still competing.


97
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,950
Though they looked still,


98
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,600
the sparring continued.


99
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,510
Shen Cangsheng is really awesome.


100
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,000
Though he is fully open,


101
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,230
actually it’s invulnerable.


102
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,440
Though Liu Mubai uses a weapon,


103
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,200
he still has no advantage at all.


104
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,200
Look at their hands and foreheads carefully.


105
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,070
He has lost.


106
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,920
Who?


107
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,670
Liu Mubai


108
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,000
Oh, right.


109
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,230
At last, Shen said


110
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,510
Mubai would’ve died if they had fought for real.


111
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,790
What else did he say?


112
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,550
You are gifted,


113
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,440
but the approach is wrong.


114
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,950
It’s not over yet.


115
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,040
You are good at spells.


116
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,480
I’m good at close combat.


117
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,550
Yet you tried to beat me in a close combat.


118
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,670
Liu Mubai


119
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,160
You are too rash.


120
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,600
You can’t


121
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,720
be a master like that.


122
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,720
That’s what I thought.


123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,200
Liu Mubai’s still haunted by pain.


124
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:18,950
Mu Chen.


125
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,350
Shen comes out.


126
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,550
Alright.


127
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,550
Go back first.


128
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:23,880
I’m going to talk with him.


129
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,200
Shen.


130
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,710
What do you think of Mubai?


131
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,280
He’s still green.


132
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:42,470
And


133
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,910
he’s haunted by pain indeed.


134
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,910
Even his moves are affected,


135
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,350
not steady enough.


136
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,000
He’s too anxious to make progress.


137
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,030
You have a point.


138
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,910
That’s what I’m worried about.


139
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,110
Liu Mubai was a great hero in Mu-Liu Battle,


140
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,280
yet the price was too big for him.


141
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,760
If left unchecked,


142
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,200
he may go astray.


143
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,470
Fine.


144
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,470
I’ll do my best


145
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,710
to help him.


146
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,230
Thanks, Shen.


147
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,350
Shen.


148
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,440
Mubai...


149
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,280
He was supposed to be a hero,


150
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,910
yet he pushed himself into despair.


151
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,000
Few can understand the pain


152
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,840
of losing one’s kin overnight.


153
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,080
I lost my family long ago.


154
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,640
They died for the country


155
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,440
or for the people.


156
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,710
To be frank,


157
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,400
my foes outnumber yours several times.


158
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,840
I don’t need pity or sympathy.


159
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,520
I don’t pity others either.


160
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,590
I just want to


161
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,080
help the comrades beside me.


162
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,960
Trust matters the most.


163
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,400
If he insists on isolating himself,


164
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,910
no one can help him.


165
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,550
I have an idea.


166
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,000
It might work.


167
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,910
Tell me about it.


168
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,350
If my plan works,


169
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:27,200
please agree to Mubai’s condition.


170
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,110
Do you know what his condition is?


171
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,030
I guess he wants to


172
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,350
go slain dragon slaves with you.


173
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,320
Maybe you are right.


174
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,110
Are you willing to do it?


175
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,520
Yes, as long as


176
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,230
I can help him.


177
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,350
I also need someone else’s help.


178
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,790
Just go


179
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,230
if you can make it.


180
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,320
They’ve gone.


181
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,640
Mubai.


182
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,280
I bring you


183
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,030
your favorite food.


184
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,080
Who is it?


185
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,110
Why did you


186
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,440
trick me to come here?


187
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,350
Don’t blame her.


188
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,110
It’s my idea.


189
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,880
Dragon slave?


190
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,790
It’s the only survivor


191
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,000
I captured when patrolling.


192
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,080
Say it!


193
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,790
Repeat what you know.


194
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,880
Yes.


195
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,400
Black Dragon lied to Liu Qingtian


196
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,230
and asked him to betray Liu Territory.


197
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,200
And


198
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,840
No-face Taoist forced Liu Qingtian


199
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,910
to receive Power of Whisper.


200
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,760
Or else,


201
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,200
he would kill his son.


202
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,590
Mubai.


203
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,400
You hear that?


204
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,200
You threatened him


205
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,000
to say so, didn’t you?


206
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,550
How come you thought that way?


207
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,670
We just don’t want to see you


208
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,280
torture yourself.


209
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,910
You shouldn’t be blamed for that.


210
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,840
Don’t punish yourself


211
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,320
and the ones by your side.


212
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,030
If you want to seek revenge,


213
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,000
they are your real foes.


214
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,230
Black Dragon has evil intentions to Human Clan


215
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,150
and tries to enslave humans.


216
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,880
He colludes with Evil Deity


217
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,440
and takes Five Sects as the first target.


218
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,030
These Dragon Slaves


219
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,670
were lurking around the Sect


220
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,960
to destroy the formation.


221
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,520
If you want to rejuvenate Liu Territory


222
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,400
and avenge your father's death,


223
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,640
you should make every effort to stop them.


224
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,030
Mubai.


225
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,790
You’re Liu Territory’s Young Master


226
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,550
and will be the lord of Liu Territory.


227
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,200
Your priority


228
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,880
is to defend Liu Territory.


229
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,550
Liu Mubai.


230
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,590
We’ve been friends since little.


231
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,550
We’ve been through thick and thin together.


232
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,000
How could I turn a blind eye to your business?


233
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,400
Look at you.


234
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,880
I can barely recognize you.


235
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,760
I don’t need pity or sympathy.


236
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,710
I don’t pity others either.


237
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:06,910
I just want to


238
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,760
help the comrades beside me.


239
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,150
Let him go.


240
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,230
Shen, please train me


241
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,400
and allow me to defend


242
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,400
the North Sect with you.


243
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,710
Though I’m not as capable as you,


244
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,280
I’m willing to contribute.


245
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:00,590
OK.


246
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,150
I used to take actions alone.


247
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,710
I’m sure


248
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,280
you’ll be my right hand.


249
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,000
I worried you.


250
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,030
I’m sorry.


251
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,200
Right.


252
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,200
You worried me.


253
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,200
And I expended


254
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,470
many power points to buy food for you.


255
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,790
Pay me back.


256
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,400
Mu Chen.


257
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,440
Thank you.


258
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,030
You helped him get rid of the pain.


259
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,550
Not at all.


260
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,350
That’s what I should do.


261
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,110
Though I decided to wait for him


262
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,320
and said I’d never give up,


263
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,080
I had no idea how long it would be.


264
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,400
That’s not you.


265
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,760
In my eyes,


266
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,440
you are a heroine.


267
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,910
You could even die for what you want.


268
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,790
Even if I didn’t help you,


269
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,030
I’m sure


270
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,030
you would change his mind someday.


271
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,280
The thing is that


272
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,640
he changed sooner under my help.


273
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,790
You are right.


274
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,710
I’m Tang Qian’er.


275
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,840
I never give up.


276
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,440
Li Xuantong.


277
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,960
You tailed me all the way.


278
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,150
Show yourself.


279
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,030
Did she send you here?


280
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,520
Go back and tell her


281
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,230
I will think about


282
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,520
her words.


283
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,000
Don’t follow me anymore.


284
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,960
You’d better stay with her


285
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,960
and protect her.


286
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,670
Li Xuantong.


287
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,470
How is Luo Li?


288
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,960
She is fine.


289
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,040
What is she hiding from me?


290
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,400
Never mind.


291
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,800
I’ll ask her tomorrow.


292
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,710
Let's go.


293
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,800
I’ll bring you back.


294
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,590
Awesome.


295
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,000
Indeed.


296
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,590
Sorry.


297
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,880
Goddess.


298
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:54,710
Xuantong.


299
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,280
Goddess.


300
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,560
I’m fine.


301
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,070
What brings you here?


302
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,880
I followed Mu Chen all day.


303
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,470
He was with Shen Cangsheng,


304
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,920
Liu Mubai and others.


305
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,230
He didn't go to He Yao’s.


306
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,560
He told me


307
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,230
he would consider your words.


308
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,760
I see.


309
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,710
Tomorrow.


310
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,470
After tomorrow,


311
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,760
you will be mine.


312
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,400
The North Sect’s protection


313
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,640
to the formation center


314
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,470
is so weak,


315
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,400
while it’s favorable


316
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,640
make it easy for me


317
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,280
When the time is up, the center


318
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:48,350
will be exploded by this time-delay device.


319
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,040
Once the barrier disappears,


320
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,590
I’ll take her away.


321
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,710
Watch out!


322
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,190
Why not tell me earlier?


323
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,950
I can’t see either.


324
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,400
My power isn’t enough.


325
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,520
I can’t sense anything.


326
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,070
Where are we now?


327
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,070
I don’t know.


328
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,160
I can just tell if there are people


329
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,830
ahead.


330
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:28,950
Watch out!


331
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,230
A pillar.


332
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,950
Now that you can sense people,


333
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,070
why not lead me to a crowded place?


334
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,760
You want to hide from Tan Qingshan


335
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,880
and look for Luo Li, right?


336
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,680
You might


337
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,230
be exposed.


338
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:29,950
Watch out.


339
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,110
It’s a wall.


340
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,760
Why are you here?


341
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,400
Thank you.


342
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,350
Sir. I...


343
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,350
You again.


344
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,230
Tang Chengbo!


345
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,230
Sir, I...


346
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,310
Mr. Zhu Tian.


347
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,640
I’m sorry.


348
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,110
I can’t see.


349
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,470
Somehow,


350
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,800
I came to your place.


351
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,880
I almost ran into the wall.


352
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,470
Luckily, he held me.


353
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,350
You’re welcome.


354
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:58,760
Sir.


355
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,400
I’m a freshman.


356
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,800
I didn’t mean to


357
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,830
come here either.


358
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,000
I’m sorry, sir.


359
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,520
You may leave.


360
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:15,950
Thank you, sir.


361
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,000
Thank you, sir.


362
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,350
Be careful. Let me hold you.


363
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,760
Be careful.


364
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:22,830
This way.


365
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,950
Turn left.


366
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,000
Slowly.


367
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,000
You’ve tailed me for so long.


368
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,880
Reveal yourself.


369
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,070
Long time no see.


370
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,160
You are not here to chat, right?


371
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
Of course not.


372
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,920
We fought against each other for years.


373
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,560
I know you are a rare talent in the North Sect.


374
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,710
You have my admiration.


375
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,280
What are you up to?


376
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,280
Black Dragon speaks highly of you.


377
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,040
He hopes you can change sides


378
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,680
to serve the Dragon Clan.


379
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,760
Does he?


380
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,640
What do I get


381
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,190
if I serve him?


382
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,190
It’s win-win.


383
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,520
If you serve Lord Black Dragon,


384
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,880
you will gain more freedom.


385
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,520
With your capability,


386
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,710
you will be a leader.


387
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,880
Fine.


388
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,040
I appreciate Black Dragon’s favor.


389
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:47,760
However,


390
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:49,640
I have a request.


391
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,560
Just tell me.


392
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,280
I want the heads of you two.


393
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,680
You’d better think it over.


394
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:07,070
The North Sect’s days are numbered.


395
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:10,110
You don’t have to die with it.


396
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,190
That will never happen.


397
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,310
Just let Black Dragon come.


398
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,950
Fine.


399
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,430
At that time,


400
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,190
do not beg me to spare you.


401
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,950
Where are you going?


402
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,310
I can take you there.


403
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,400
OK.


404
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,230
Thank you.


405
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,040
I don’t remember


406
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,760
hearing your voice before.


407
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,280
I’m a freshman.


408
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,280
I lost my way. I didn’t come


409
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,640
until yesterday.


410
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,110
I see.


411
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:52,920
I’m a freshman, too.


412
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,000
I’m Mu Chen.


413
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,070
What’s your name?


414
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,070
I’m Tang Chengbo.


415
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,350
Where are you heading to?


416
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,800
I’m looking for someone.


417
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,920
But I don’t know where she is.


418
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,070
Can you


419
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,590
take me back to the dorm?


420
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:09,680
Sure.


421
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,470
I’m going to the dorm too.


422
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,560
Who are you looking for?


423
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,640
A girl.


424
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,350
You like her, right?


425
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,110
I have no idea


426
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,680
if she likes me too.


427
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,560
Tell me.


428
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,520
What does she look like?


429
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:33,830
She’s pretty.


430
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,230
She was cold


431
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,310
when we first met.


432
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,040
But later, I found that


433
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,310
she is a warm-hearted girl.


434
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,520
So is she.


435
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,070
Who?


436
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,160
The girl who you like?


437
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:50,950
I made up my mind


438
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,310
to marry her at the first sight.


439
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,430
But she


440
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,430
has been indifferent to me.


441
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,310
But that’s exactly my type.


442
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,710
Do we fall in love with the same girl?


443
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,110
Impossible.


444
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,830
We even don't know each other.


445
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:15,070
Do all girls behave like that?


446
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:18,160
The heart can tell what you want.


447
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,590
There’s no right or wrong in love.


448
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,040
Has she


449
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,680
accepted you?


450
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,710
Yes, we are going to get married.


451
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,400
Really?


452
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,520
Congrats.


453
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,710
Don't forget to


454
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,920
invite me to your wedding.


455
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,640
Sure.


456
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,760
Let's go.


457
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,160
Be careful.


458
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,560
The Dragon Roc Arena is ahead.


459
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,000
I know the way from there.


460
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:43,950
Tang Chengbo.


461
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,710
Thank you for bringing me back.


462
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,520
No need.


463
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,830
Goodbye then.


464
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:48,880
See you next time.


465
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,190
We are destined to meet.


466
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:52,760
I’m sure


467
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,040
we’ll see each other again.


468
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,310
Take care.


469
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:55,710
Alright.


470
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,470
See you.


471
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,160
See you.


472
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,640
Luo Li is still sparring on the stage.


473
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,110
She may die.


474
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,040
Why does she overstretch herself


475
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,110
to do that?


476
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,110
No matter what,


477
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,920
she on a winning streak.


478
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,640
Excuse me.


479
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,310
You said Luo Li is fighting on the stage?


480
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,110
Yes.


481
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,710
She’s been sparring for days.


482
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,280
She may die.


483
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,760
Are you looking for Luo Li?


484
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,400
Yes.


485
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,230
It occurs to me that


486
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,350
I have business to do


487
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,710
in the arena.


488
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,920
We are going to the same place.


489
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,070
Since you can’t see,


490
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,160
let’s go together.


491
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:32,710
OK.


492
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,350
Thank you.


493
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,760
Sorry.


494
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,230
Next.


495
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:45,680
Luo Li.


496
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,470
Mu Chen.


497
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,280
You...


498
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,760
Why do you spar here?


499
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,590
You said the Jade Knot


500
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,070
is the only cure of my eyes.


501
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,470
Are you collecting power points


502
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,710
in exchange for the Jade Knot?


503
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,590
Jade Knot?


504
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,470
I read it in a book.


505
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,520
But this plant


506
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,040
has disappeared long ago.


507
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:03,950
Crap.


508
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:04,590
It’s said that


509
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,710
there’s still some in Lei Territory of the North Sect.


510
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,560
No wonder she almost worked herself to death.


511
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:12,070
Tons of power points are needed to access there.


512
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:15,400
Even Shen doesn’t have enough.


513
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,590
Luo Li.


514
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,950
You want to go to Lei Territory for me?


515
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,800
The arena is for sparring.


516
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,950
Are you up


517
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,520
to challenge me?


518
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,470
Luo Li.


519
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,190
If you do it to cure my eyes,


520
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,950
I don’t allow you to harm yourself.


521
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,230
Fight,


522
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,560
or leave.


523
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,560
I’ll take care of


524
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,520
my eyes myself.


525
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,800
Mu Chen.


526
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,590
You knew it, right?


527
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,640
I...


528
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,520
Mu Chen.


529
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,230
I had no choice.


530
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:06,920
Mu Chen.


531
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,280
Luo Li.


532
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,560
You’ve changed your mind?


533
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,000
No.


534
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,000
I came to tell you


535
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,190
I’ll get the Jade Knot


536
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,590
in one year.


537
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,400
Before that,


538
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,310
don’t try other ways.


539
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,070
Luo Li.


540
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,160
It’s about my eyes.


541
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,070
Don’t risk your life.


542
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,830
If you insist,


543
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,950
I’d rather be blind forever.


544
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,640
Your business is mine.


545
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,160
I’m doing it willingly.


546
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:35,830
It’s my decision.


547
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,760
Listen up.


548
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,760
It’s about my eyes.


549
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,680
I don’t need your help.


550
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,710
Qingshan.


551
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,560
Let's go.


552
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,680
Mu Chen.


553
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,110
Luo Li.


554
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,880
Long time no see.


555
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,430
Are you Xue Lingzi?


556
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,640
Luo Li.


557
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,710
What’s your relationship with Mu Chen?


558
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,110
None of your business.


559
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,230
Fine.


560
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,950
You are mine


561
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,590
from now on.


562
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,920
No one else can have you.


563
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,640
I admire you for so many years.


564
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,590
Finally, I’ll be with you.


565
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,470
Save it.


566
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,230
Your power


567
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:44,520
is sealed by me.


568
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,310
Mu Chen.


569
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,280
Where are we going?


570
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,760
Take me to He Yao.


571
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:53,590
He Yao?


572
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,280
Luo Li doesn’t allow you to see him.


573
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,350
Do not tell her.


574
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,710
Stop.


575
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,950
Forget it. Don’t make it harder for me.


576
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,800
Things are complicated enough.


577
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,160
You are my friend, aren’t you?


578
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,400
You’d rather help her


579
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,640
other than your friend?


580
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,160
Let's go.


581
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,040
Go.


582
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,640
I’ll help you, alright?


583
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,680
Crap!


584
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,350
No!


585
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,280
Mu Chen.


586
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,800
Are you asking for me?


587
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,950
Mr. He Yao.


588
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,710
Can I regain my vision?


589
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,110
Now that you don’t trust me,


590
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,230
why bother coming to me?


591
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,680
Qingshan.


592
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:15,470
Yes.


593
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,800
Go to check what happened outside.


594
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,160
Go ahead.


595
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,350
I’m here with him.


596
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,590
Luo Li.


597
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,400
Qingshan.


598
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,800
Why are you here?


599
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:49,880
I heard the sound, so I came over.


600
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,830
I was patrolling around the barrier


601
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,160
when the formation was broken.


602
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,160
I thought Dragon Clan invaded us.


603
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,760
Then I ran into you.


604
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,400
He destroyed the Protection Circle.


605
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,230
Who are you?


606
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:04,160
How dare you break in?


607
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,160
Meddlesome.


608
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,630
Luo Li.


609
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,870
I’ll surely marry you.


610
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,000
Thanks, Shen.


611
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,600
Thanks, Qingshan.


612
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,120
You’re welcome.


613
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:31,320
The barrier was broken.


614
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,120
The Dragon Clan will take advantage of it.


615
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,630
Beware of it.


616
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,630
I’ll


617
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:46,760
infuse power to your power veins


618
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:49,040
to inspect your condition in detail.


619
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,320
After all, it’s not your power.


620
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,280
Your body will reject it.


621
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:55,469
If you don’t trust me, I won’t force you.


622
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,630
I do.


623
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,560
Thank you, sir.


624
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,910
How do you feel?


625
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,360
Not too bad.


626
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:50,280
I’ve restrained some bans in your power veins,


627
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,760
yet it can’t be settled


628
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,430
only by power.


629
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,600
Thank you, sir.


630
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,320
The bans in your body aren’t that simple.


631
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,150
And it’s been a long time.


632
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,710
They’ve rooted in your body.


633
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,360
If the residual poison isn’t removed,


634
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,710
it will be really harmful.


635
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,190
Please help me, sir.


636
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,520
Power veins are the foundation of the body.


637
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,280
If damaged,


638
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,600
they’re extremely hard to restore.


639
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,430
That’s the tricky part.


640
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,080
I’ll look up relevant files


641
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:24,280
and root out the bans


642
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,320
from your power veins bit by bit.


643
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,870
But


644
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,630
the pain in the process is unbearable.


645
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,840
I’ve made up my mind.


646
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,320
However painful it is, I’ll give it a shot.


647
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,280
You may rest today.


648
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:44,710
Come to me in two days.


649
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,760
Thank you, sir.


650
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:04,840
Goddess.


651
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,470
I should’ve been at your side.


652
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,760
Sorry for my negligence.


653
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:13,910
Xuantong.


654
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,710
It's not your fault.


655
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,430
No one expected Xue Lingzi


656
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,120
would sneak in.


657
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,670
How are you now?


658
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,870
I channeled power to heal the wound.


659
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,760
There were still some blockages.


660
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,280
Let me help you.


661
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:28,950
No need.


662
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:31,190
My power isn’t affected.


663
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,800
I’ll recover soon.


664
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:37,710
Goddess.


665
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,360
It’s not safe here anymore.


666
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,320
We should go back.


667
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:40,910
No.


668
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,390
I still have unfinished business.


669
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,710
Leader meant to


670
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,390
protect you with North Sect’s defensive formation


671
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,520
and the staff here,


672
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,190
yet Xue Lingzi


673
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,390
still managed to sneak in


674
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,800
and almost took you away.


675
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:54,470
It means Human Clan Territory is no longer safe.


676
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:56,430
I’ll never leave


677
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,710
until my wish is achieved.


678
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,320
Goddess...


679
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,190
Say no more.


680
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,120
Fine.


681
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,870
You sparred with others


682
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,520
and got extremely exhausted.


683
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,840
After what happened today,


684
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,950
your body couldn’t bear it.


685
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,390
Please take a good rest these days.


686
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,630
Don’t spar with others.


687
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:17,230
I’ll try to get enough power points.


688
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:29,670
Qian’er.


689
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,230
How is your injury?


690
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,560
It has healed.


691
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:41,000
My power has improved a lot.


692
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,520
That's great.


693
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,000
My power was stagnant back then,


694
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,390
even declining,


695
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,520
perhaps because I was


696
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,800
restless and unsettled.


697
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,800
I’m with you now.


698
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,910
Everything will be fine.


699
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:07,840
Now you cultivate with Shen.


700
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,360
You may take the opportunity


701
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,470
and learn from him.


702
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:11,430
Of course.


703
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:13,710
How about


704
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,800
you have another spar with Shen?


705
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,950
Shen is much more capable than me.


706
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,360
I can’t win.


707
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:21,190
I know you can’t.


708
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,910
I mean you can


709
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,040
get improved quickly


710
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,150
by sparing with a master.


711
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:31,840
As you wish.


712
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,840
Mr. Zhu Tian.


713
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,000
How is it going?


714
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,280
It’s under repair.


715
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,800
I have no idea


716
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,360
when it can be restored.


717
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,040
What’s the matter?


718
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,430
Luo Li is reluctant to come in.


719
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,320
How so?


720
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:13,950
She feels guilty about the damage.


721
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,120
Does she?


722
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,150
Luo Li.


723
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,950
It has nothing to do with you.


724
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,190
Don’t feel guilty.


725
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,040
That man was here to capture me.


726
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,840
Was he Tang Chengbo, a nerd


727
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:32,760
who even knows nothing about courtesy?


728
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:34,670
He wasn’t Tang Chengbo.


729
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,000
I’ve investigated it.


730
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,520
Tang Chengbo


731
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,120
is unable to defeat Luo Li.


732
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,080
So he is...


733
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,430
He is Xue Lingzi,


734
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,870
the leader of Xue God Clan.


735
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,870
He sneaked in to take me back


736
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,950
and marry me.


737
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:55,840
Sorry.


738
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,520
I got the sect implicated.


739
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,760
You shouldn’t be blamed.


740
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:05,190
I failed to guard the formation center.


741
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:06,800
Alright.


742
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,040
Our priority


743
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:09,600
is to repair the center


744
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,280
to protect students.


745
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,360
I agree.


746
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,800
How long will the restoration take?


747
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:16,390
The center is severely damaged.


748
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,230
I’m afraid we need Headmaster Ling Xi


749
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,390
to fix it.


750
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,190
OK.


751
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,910
I’ll go find her.
