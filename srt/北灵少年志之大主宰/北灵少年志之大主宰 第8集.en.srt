1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,480
Mu Chen.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,230
I need to go to Luo’s Sacred Mountain.

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,560
There’s said to be replacement for Jiuyou Spirit Blood.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,720
Then I’ll go with you.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,680
No.

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,440
Only people from Luo God Clan can get in there.

8
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:18,440
It’s safe.

9
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,040
Luo Li!

10
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,280
See you in three days.

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,680
I’ll be OK.

12
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,040
Luo Li!

13
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,550
Take care, then.

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,040
Be careful.

15
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:47,400
Father.

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:49,880
Mubai.

17
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,040
What’s wrong?

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,790
What do you think of

19
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,270
Uncle Liu Zong’s death?

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,950
He died of disease.

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,270
And I feel sorry about that.

22
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,720
After No-Face Taoist came to our territory,

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,440
Uncle Liu Zong died.

24
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,720
He took Uncle’s place

25
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,360
and asked us to be ready for wars.

26
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,550
Father.

27
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,270
What the hell does he want?

28
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,910
I told you.

29
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,510
I asked that.

30
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,120
Then what the hell do you want?

31
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,080
How dare you!

32
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,590
How dare you talk to me like that!

33
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:24,720
Sorry, father.

34
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,830
But look at No-Face Taoist.

35
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,120
We don’t know who he really is.

36
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,800
We mustn’t trust him readily.

37
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,550
Mubai.

38
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,759
No-Face Taoist

39
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,680
is loyal to us.

40
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:39,229
He’s the best man to take Liu Zong’s place.

41
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:39,830
Father.

42
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,509
I don’t think

43
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,270
Uncle died of disease.

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,550
Hope you can check on that.

45
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,630
If we trust the wrong guy,

46
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,759
Uncle can’t rest in peace.

47
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:52,509
Get out!

48
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:54,360
Out!

49
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,240
How smart he is.

50
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,270
Just as you are.

51
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,240
No-face.

52
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,470
He’s not Liu Zong.

53
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,240
He’s my son.

54
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,880
Are you going to kill him, too?

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,829
As long as you and your son listen to me

56
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,440
and obey me,

57
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,030
you’ll have great wealth for your life.

58
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:38,520
Answer my question!

59
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,079
It depends on

60
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,600
what your son is going to do.

61
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,880
I dare you!

62
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,750
I don’t dare.

63
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:52,190
But if your son causes trouble

64
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,910
and Lord Black Dragon blames us…

65
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,720
However, don’t worry too much.

66
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,830
Your son is born to be kind.

67
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,190
That’s good.

68
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,190
With such nature,

69
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,360
he can just go for one thing

70
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,830
and do us a big favor.

71
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,659
The Great Ruler

72
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:43,580
Episode 8

73
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,040
Jiuyou?

74
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:47,880
Jiuyou?

75
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,000
Jiuyou?

76
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,600
Jiuyou, where are you?

77
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,950
What?

78
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,350
Jiuyou.

79
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,440
I come to apologize.

80
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:03,920
I was wrong.

81
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,320
I shouldn’t have blamed you

82
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,070
for everything.

83
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,760
So?

84
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,040
I don’t mean declining your help.

85
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,510
But I can’t always live

86
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,640
under your protection.

87
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,350
Do you understand?

88
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,600
Nope.

89
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,160
What do you mean?

90
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,200
I must hunt on my own.

91
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,390
I can’t always get the prey from you.

92
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,920
Fine, then.

93
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,550
But let me make it clear.

94
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,230
We’re connected.

95
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,160
In case of danger,

96
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,510
I don’t care so much.

97
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,760
I don’t want to die with you.

98
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,640
Jiuyou.

99
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,159
When we’re in danger,

100
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,390
even if you don’t help me,

101
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,350
I’ll beg for help.

102
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,670
All right.

103
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,510
I wasted much power to save you.

104
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,390
I’m going to get some sleep.

105
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,159
Remember to practice hard.

106
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,760
We made a deal.

107
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,790
Rest assured.

108
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,880
Thank you, Jiuyou.

109
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,070
Father.

110
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,320
Mubai.

111
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,640
What’s wrong, Father?

112
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,200
Just flesh wound.

113
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,160
I’m OK.

114
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,270
Mubai.

115
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,110
You got No-Face Taoist wrong.

116
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,760
Yesterday, you told me

117
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,720
you suspected Liu Zong’s death.

118
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,390
I felt something wrong, too.

119
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,270
I was about to check it

120
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,880
when I met Mo Xingtian.

121
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,920
Mo Xingtian?

122
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,600
Mo Xingtian who works for Black Dragon?

123
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,390
Exactly.

124
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,320
He’s a superb fighter.

125
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,760
Luckily, No-Face Taoist arrived in time

126
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,000
and saved me.

127
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,760
Also,

128
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,600
I beat him with one stroke.

129
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,880
He was badly injured.

130
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,670
I don’t think

131
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,390
he’ll stay in our territory.

132
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,320
Mo Xingtian is in our territory?

133
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,880
Has our plan been exposed?

134
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,320
Mubai.

135
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,830
Send a letter to Mu Feng.

136
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,760
I wrote what happened and our plan

137
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,270
in the letter.

138
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,920
It’s time to take action.

139
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,110
Yes.

140
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,720
I see.

141
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,640
Remember.

142
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,440
You must be cautious.

143
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,510
Don’t let anyone know it.

144
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,600
Nice acting.

145
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,720
You had a good plan, too.

146
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,550
Hope your son won’t let us down.

147
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,160
Dad.

148
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,920
Where’s Luo Li?

149
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,720
She said

150
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,390
she found replacement for Spirit Blood

151
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,000
and she went to check it.

152
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,070
She’ll be back in three days.

153
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,790
She just told you?

154
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,390
Dad.

155
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,670
What’s wrong?

156
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,550
Ruler.

157
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,670
Young Master Liu Mubai asked to see you.

158
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,950
For something important, he said.

159
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,040
OK.

160
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:25,880
Get him in.

161
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:26,350
Yes.

162
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,270
Dad.

163
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,670
I’ll leave you alone.

164
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,040
Liu Mubai must have come

165
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,320
for something very important.

166
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,320
Don’t leave.

167
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,880
You should stay and listen.

168
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,669
You’re no longer young.

169
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,960
Sooner or later,

170
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,150
I’ll hand our territory over to you.

171
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,590
Mr. Mu.

172
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,280
Don’t stand on ceremony.

173
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,440
I heard you had something to tell me.

174
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,110
A letter for you.

175
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,080
Mu.

176
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,710
My son will arrive at the Lake of Dragon

177
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,230
by eleven tomorrow night.

178
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,200
Hope you can come

179
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,670
and help us.

180
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,880
From Liu Qingtian.

181
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,470
OK.

182
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,030
Mubai.

183
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,840
Go and tell your father.

184
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,320
I’ll go to the Lake of Dragon on time

185
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,110
as agreed in the letter.

186
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:09,710
OK.

187
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,440
See you, Mr. Mu.

188
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,670
Liu Mubai.

189
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,030
Don’t go.

190
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,030
I have something to tell you.

191
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,000
My father asked me not to linger.

192
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,280
Just for a quarter.

193
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,000
Take it as a cup of tea from my dad.

194
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,710
Let’s go.

195
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,280
Mu Chen always knows how to have fun.

196
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,320
What a nice story!

197
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,520
Tell me.

198
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,280
What do you want?

199
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,470
Let’s get in.

200
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,670
What do you mean?

201
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,590
Mubai.

202
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,350
I want to apologize to you.

203
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,520
In that match,

204
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,030
I cheated.

205
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,280
Cheated?

206
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,000
How did you?

207
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,550
Do you remember

208
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,760
the bird’s egg in Jade Fruit Tree?

209
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,030
That’s the egg of Jiuyou Bird.

210
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,710
Jiuyou Bird

211
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,760
is a magic beast with the blood of Phoenix

212
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,080
That day, she broke out of the shell,

213
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,790
but failed to grow up.

214
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,590
Then she entered my body,

215
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,670
and continued her evolvement

216
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,280
in my mind.

217
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,440
Jiuyou is

218
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,110
in your body?

219
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,350
Mubai.

220
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,000
In that match,

221
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,710
I couldn’t defeat you.

222
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,640
But at the critical moment,

223
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,150
she controlled my mind.

224
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,110
I took it back at last.

225
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,470
But it was too late…

226
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,200
So…

227
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,710
You defeated me

228
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,280
with the power of Jiuyou

229
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,150
while you didn’t know it?

230
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,230
Exactly.

231
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,110
Mubai.

232
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,790
When we fought,

233
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,440
your fan was broken.

234
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,670
The Devil-sealing Fan…

235
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,670
I made it the whole day and night.

236
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,840
Take it as my apology.

237
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,880
Devil-sealing Fan?

238
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,280
It’s made of gold alloy

239
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,030
and mixed with magic stones.

240
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,350
You mixed gold alloy

241
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,150
with magic stones at a high temperature?

242
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,030
I stole the gold alloy from my dad…

243
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,550
I mean, borrowed.

244
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,030
I used Burning Spell

245
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,840
to mix them up.

246
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,440
Then I used Freezing Spell

247
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,880
to cool the fan quickly,

248
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,440
so that it had great ductility

249
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,000
and wouldn’t be easily broken.

250
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,400
What’s the inscription?

251
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,320
I read books for days

252
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,350
to get inspired.

253
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,910
I call it

254
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,960
Five-element Circle.

255
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:14,840
Look.

256
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,150
On the fan there is a big circle

257
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,440
and four small circles.

258
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,520
When you fight,

259
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,520
you can use different circles

260
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,200
by waving the fan differently.

261
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,230
Then you’ll save time in drawing circles.

262
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,470
It’ll save your breath.

263
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,320
I like the Fan.

264
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,200
Mu Chen.

265
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,230
Thank you.

266
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,550
I was too narrow-minded

267
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,880
for what happened.

268
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,470
Since you accept the Fan,

269
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,230
please do me a favor.

270
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:42,790
OK.

271
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,520
What is it?

272
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,590
I haven’t yet

273
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,400
chosen my own attacking spell.

274
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,960
Choose one for me.

275
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,150
There’re thousands of spells.

276
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,030
Everyone has different natures

277
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,030
and body constitutions

278
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,840
and needs different spells.

279
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,230
What I choose may not suit you.

280
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,960
Aren’t you known as

281
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,840
the best spell guy in Beiling School?

282
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,080
Just help me out.

283
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,200
All right.

284
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,350
I’ll try my best.

285
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,000
Collect the power of five elements,

286
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,110
all rise

287
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,030
and come to one.

288
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:17,960
Awesome fan!

289
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,670
Up!

290
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,550
Senluo Death Spell.

291
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,960
What is that?

292
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,150
Awesome?

293
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,400
This is a dangerous and powerful spell.

294
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,230
When someone used it,

295
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,280
all his meridians broke

296
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,400
and he nearly lost all his power.

297
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,590
Then no one else ever used that again.

298
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,320
Mu Chen.

299
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,590
Since you asked me to choose a spell for you,

300
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,910
I must be responsible.

301
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,150
If there’s any accident…

302
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:33,760
Mubai.

303
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,320
Do you remember what Mr. Mo said?

304
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,280
The more dangerous a spell we use,

305
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,440
the more patience and better nature

306
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,280
we need.

307
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,910
If I can’t even get over

308
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,000
such danger,

309
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,840
I won’t ever get stronger.

310
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,000
Do you believe in me?

311
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,760
I do.

312
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,000
Why must I hide?

313
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,910
What’s going on?

314
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:38,790
Doomed!

315
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,880
The spell turned!

316
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,350
Suck my power into your blood.

317
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,230
What’s…

318
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,080
What’s going on?

319
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,790
Qian’er, stay away.

320
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,150
Once the spell isn’t properly handled,

321
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,760
it might hurt someone else.

322
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,150
Mubai.

323
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,110
What are you doing?

324
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,150
Senluo Death Spell

325
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,350
spreads through blood.

326
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,550
I can’t completely control it

327
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,840
without Blood-controlling Spell.

328
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,030
Mubai.

329
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,280
I don’t have enough power!

330
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,640
I can help.

331
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,470
Qian’er.

332
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,440
Attack me.

333
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
How can I?

334
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,670
If you don’t,

335
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,030
Mu Chen and I will die.

336
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,640
Mu Chen.

337
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,000
Are you all right?

338
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,190
Yes.

339
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,000
Mubai.

340
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:14,680
Mubai.

341
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,190
Don’t move.

342
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:26,470
I’m glad you’re here.

343
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,640
If I weren’t,

344
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,590
you would have been dead.

345
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,710
Sorry.

346
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,920
I was too rash.

347
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,070
You lost so much power

348
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,110
and got hurt.

349
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,160
Mubai.

350
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,470
Get some rest before you leave.

351
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,040
That’s the only option.

352
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,040
Ruler Liu.

353
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:09,280
Your son is coming back.

354
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,350
What’s your plan?

355
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,590
I’ll let no one in my way.

356
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,230
Mubai is a boy.

357
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,190
Since he doesn’t understand us,

358
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,800
don’t let him bother

359
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,950
about the implementation.

360
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,640
Ruler Liu.

361
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,470
You’re really a man to success.

362
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,230
Somebody!

363
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,830
Yes, Ruler.

364
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,400
When Mubai comes back,

365
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,920
bring him to my study.

366
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:43,950
Remember.

367
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,830
Don’t go through the main door.

368
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,710
Yes.

369
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:04,520
Mu Chen.

370
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,560
You can read this.

371
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,710
It will help

372
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,560
with your practice.

373
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,190
I see.

374
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,880
Time is running out

375
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:12,680
Go talk to her.

376
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,680
Go!

377
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,110
Qian’er.

378
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,760
After you go back home,

379
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,800
when are you going to come back?

380
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,230
Maybe…

381
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,470
in quite a while.

382
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,070
So, you’re planning to

383
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,800
leave me alone at School?

384
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,400
I can’t take you back.

385
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,350
There’s too much danger.

386
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,470
What’s the secret?

387
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,920
Why are you even hiding it from me?

388
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,920
Don’t you have anything to tell me?

389
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:08,760
I do.

390
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,430
A lot.

391
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,680
Say it then.

392
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,040
I’m sorry

393
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:17,920
for what I did.

394
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,350
Why do you bring it up?

395
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,880
I know you didn’t mean that.

396
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:23,760
And…

397
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,920
Sorry.

398
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,640
Anything else?

399
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,760
Liu Mubai.

400
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,520
Come here!

401
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,760
I really can’t stand it!

402
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,430
It should have been easier!

403
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,520
Just tell her

404
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,880
you will marry her

405
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:47,950
after everything is solved.

406
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,470
But it’s our marriage…

407
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,350
Don’t you want that?

408
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,190
I do.

409
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,280
Sure, I do.

410
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,040
That’s right.

411
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,590
Just tell her!

412
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,040
Mr. Mu.

413
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,470
Thank you for taking care of me.

414
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,110
You’re welcome.

415
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:14,520
Mu Chen.

416
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,520
Thank you for the Fan.

417
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,470
Don’t casually use Senluo Death Spell.

418
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,520
You’re not experienced in that.

419
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,760
It’ll bring danger.

420
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,880
I see. I see.

421
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,760
Remember what I told you.

422
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,310
I’ve got something to do with my father.

423
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,470
We’ll leave you alone.

424
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,400
Qian’er.

425
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,070
Be careful

426
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,160
on your way back.

427
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,000
After everything ends,

428
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,590
I’ll go visit Mr. Tang

429
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,470
and propose to marry you.

430
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,710
But…

431
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,280
I want to go with you.

432
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,000
I want you to stay at home

433
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,280
and wait for me.

434
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,000
Wait

435
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
until I propose to you.

436
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:40,830
You…

437
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:41,640
You!

438
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,110
You heard us?

439
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,000
Yes, I did.

440
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,680
Liu Mubai was confessing his love to you.

441
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,710
Why did you react nothing

442
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,160
just like an idiot?

443
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,520
I…

444
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,040
I didn’t know what to do.

445
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,110
But you should at least know

446
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,710
you can’t just stay here in a daze.

447
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,590
He asked me to wait at home.

448
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,520
Since when were you so obedient?

449
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,560
If you want to go after him,

450
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,710
just go.

451
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,000
OK.

452
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,190
Goddess.

453
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,190
Stop hesitating.

454
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,350
Go back with me.

455
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,470
I will.

456
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,880
But on one condition.

457
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,590
What is it?

458
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,400
Just tell me.

459
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,280
Don’t hurt anyone in Human Clan,

460
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,560
especially those in Mu Territory.

461
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:55,950
Definitely no problem.

462
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:56,310
Uh…

463
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,640
There’s still little problem.

464
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,350
If you don’t mind,

465
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,560
may I seal

466
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,640
some of your vital parts?

467
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,350
No offense,

468
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,470
just in case you might change your mind.

469
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,800
And I can’t explain to my master then.

470
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,000
That’s OK.

471
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,070
But…

472
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,830
as long as I find you hurt any human,

473
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,430
I won’t go back with you,

474
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,760
even if I have to die.

475
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,760
By then,

476
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,230
I’ll see how you can explain to Xue Lingzi.

477
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,280
I don’t dare.

478
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,470
This way, please.

479
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:41,190
The Black Dragon took over the Lake of Dragon for years

480
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,920
and absorbed all power secretly.

481
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:47,350
We don’t know what he’s up to.

482
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,760
In Beiling,

483
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,190
everything will be gone

484
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,950
and our people will live in destitution.

485
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,470
I,

486
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,950
the Ruler of Mu Territory,

487
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,470
have the responsibility

488
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,590
and duty to stop this.

489
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,160
If we have to fight the Dragon Clan,

490
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,350
will we…

491
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,760
The Black Dragon is powerful.

492
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,590
But we’re in alliance with Liu Territory.

493
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,040
We’ll attack the Lake of Dragon together

494
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,400
when the enemy least expects it.

495
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,350
We hardly get on well with Liu Territory.

496
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,920
Does Liu Qingtian really want to work with us?

497
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,520
If we fail,

498
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:25,760
I’m afraid Black Dragon will take crazy revenge.

499
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,040
Just because of this,

500
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,350
we must fight him with the determination

501
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,520
to die.

502
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,800
Even Liu Qingtian doesn’t help us,

503
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:35,280
we must fight with all our strength.

504
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,680
This fight

505
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,920
concerns our future.

506
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,830
Hope you can fight the enemy

507
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,880
together with me.

508
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,590
Yes.

509
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,230
Ruler.

510
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,160
So much for today’s meeting.

511
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,310
Get ready, guys.

512
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,230
Yes.

513
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,160
Dad.

514
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,430
What’s up?

515
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,160
According to the scout,

516
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,560
a small group of Xue God Clan

517
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,310
appeared on the border of
Mu Territory and Liu Territory.

518
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,430
They are going to leave Mu Territory

519
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,470
for the other.

520
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,560
Besides,

521
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,000
Luo Li is with them.

522
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,880
They must have caught Luo Li

523
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,880
on her way to the Sacred Mountain.

524
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,430
I’m going to save her.

525
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,640
Chen.

526
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,400
You didn’t get me.

527
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,680
I mean

528
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,880
Luo Li is on the way

529
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,430
with them.

530
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,950
They seem to respect her.

531
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,760
And she doesn’t look nervous.

532
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,350
That means

533
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,160
she isn’t arrested.

534
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,280
What do you mean?

535
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:10,070
Maybe she wasn’t caught.

536
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,590
Instead, she chose to go with them.

537
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,710
Chen.

538
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,760
You should know why she did that.

539
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,830
I must go save her.

540
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,110
Chen.

541
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,950
What are you doing to do?

542
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,000
Bring her back forcibly?

543
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,950
What consequence it may bring?

544
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,110
Can you bear that?

545
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,040
If you think carefully about it,

546
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:34,400
I won’t stop you.

547
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:35,350
Dad.

548
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,190
I thought carefully about it.

549
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,680
I won’t bring her back forcibly.

550
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,110
I know

551
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,190
she will still go to Xue God Clan

552
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,190
even if I take her back this time.

553
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,310
I just want her to know that

554
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,680
Xue God Clan won’t

555
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,590
let go of her clan even if she sacrifices.

556
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,470
I believe.

557
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,520
If she knows that,

558
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:59,070
she won’t marry Xue Lingzi.

559
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,430
As long as you made up your mind.

560
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,280
Dad, you’ll let me go?

561
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,760
You’ve grown up.

562
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,520
You should

563
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,230
make your own decisions.

564
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,280
But let me make it clear.

565
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,400
This time,

566
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,070
I can’t help you.

567
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,040
You are on your own.

568
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,880
Thank you, dad.

569
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,950
I can handle that alone.

570
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,590
What’s your plan?

571
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,560
Dad.

572
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,830
Do you remember some pills

573
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,280
you made when I was little?

574
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,070
If I remember correctly,

575
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,680
that’s Truth Pill.

576
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,680
I understand.

577
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,920
It’s on the shelf of the practicing room.

578
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,800
Go find it.

579
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,280
I’ll be back soon.

580
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,310
Dad.

581
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,590
If I fail to come back

582
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,800
before you set out,

583
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,040
leave without me.

584
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,590
I’ll catch up with you.

585
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,590
Ruler.

586
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,950
Isn’t it dangerous to let him go alone?

587
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,110
We should trust him.

588
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,230
But he…

589
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,640
All right. Say no more.

590
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:10,880
Give my order.

591
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,920
We’re leaving tomorrow.

592
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,280
Yes.

593
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,310
Yanjing.

594
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,280
Will our son

595
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,800
share our fate again?

596
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:51,110
Why did Luo Li bite the hook?

597
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,000
I’m asking you.

598
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,760
Her clan always fights

599
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,160
with Xue God Clan.

600
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,160
And hers is always at a disadvantage.

601
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,000
The Leader of Xue God Clan, Xue Lingzi said

602
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,800
he would destroy her clan

603
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,560
if Luo Li didn’t marry him.

604
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,350
How silly she is!

605
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,110
Does she think

606
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,710
Xue Lingzi will stop if she marries him?

607
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,160
To Xue Lingzi,

608
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,110
she’s the prey.

609
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,680
So is her clan.

610
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,680
Why did you let her go?

611
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:25,190
She said she went for replacement
for Jiuyou Spirit Blood.

612
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,400
How do I know the truth?

613
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,920
Are you an idiot?

614
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:31,230
How could you believe such a poor lie?

615
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Jiuyou Spirit Blood is unique.

616
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,040
In this world,

617
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,680
nothing can be the replacement.

618
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,230
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

619
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,800
Why are you angry with me?

620
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,470
I didn’t know that.

621
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,920
You’ve been inside me!

622
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,950
How could you not know?

623
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,280
Don’t I sleep?

624
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,400
You failed to keep her.

625
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,000
Why are you yelling at me?

626
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,040
All right.

627
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,190
My bad.

628
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,280
And you’re right!

629
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,350
Goddess.

630
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,230
Please.

631
00:30:59,110 --> 00:30:59,950
Come over.

632
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,800
Goddess.

633
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,950
After we leave Beiling,

634
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,590
there’ll be no more towns

635
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,520
until we reach

636
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,950
the Transmitting Circle in West Land.

637
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:14,520
Considering our strength,

638
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,640
it’ll take us two or three days to get there.

639
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,070
No offense,

640
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,040
but just in case

641
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,000
they’re too weak to walk on.

642
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,710
Why don’t we find somewhere

643
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:25,470
to have a rest?

644
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:26,830
OK, but don’t stay overnight in town

645
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,070
unless you have to.

646
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,040
I want no trouble.

647
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:32,680
Yes.

648
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,470
Leave as soon as we can.

649
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:36,680
Yes.

650
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,310
Young Master.

651
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,000
Your father has been waiting for you.

652
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,040
He asked you to go back soon.

653
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,800
Let’s go.

654
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:24,950
Father?

655
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:26,590
Father?

656
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,280
What are you doing?

657
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,880
Open the door!

658
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:56,680
Father!

659
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,280
Why do you lock me up?

660
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,280
You don’t need to take part in the battle

661
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,280
at the Lake of Dragon.

662
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,640
Just stay here.

663
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,310
But why?

664
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,230
For your own good.

665
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,040
And for our future.

666
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,400
Don’t blame me.

667
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,640
Father.

668
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,070
You asked me to send a letter to Mr. Mu

669
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,800
and now lock me up.

670
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,920
Are you going to

671
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,920
hurt him and his territory?

672
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,800
Did you not plan to

673
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,310
work with him?

674
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:24,560
From the very beginning,

675
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,760
you pretended to make an alliance.

676
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:27,760
Father.

677
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,160
Did you work for the Black Dragon?

678
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:33,710
How can you be so disloyal?

679
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,640
You used me to cheat Mr. Mu.

680
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:37,830
In the future,

681
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,070
how can I face them?

682
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,160
And how dare we

683
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,760
face all the other territories

684
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,710
in Beiling?

685
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:45,430
Shut up!

686
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,520
You’re my son.

687
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,160
You only need to take responsibility for our territory,

688
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,880
instead of Mu Territory.

689
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,280
We’re mortals.

690
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:58,110
Humble Mu Feng challenged Dragon Clan.

691
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,640
But I’m not going to die with him.

692
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,470
Taking the chance and destroying Mu Territory

693
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,400
can be the best choice for us.

694
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,280
Destroying Mu Territory?

695
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,800
The Lake of Dragon is a trap?

696
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,000
You want to lure them there!

697
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,710
Father.

698
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,670
You’re not only disloyal,

699
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,190
but also set a trap!

700
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:18,710
Enough!

701
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:20,360
Stop it!

702
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,040
Just stay here.

703
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:24,320
You’re not going out.

704
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:27,469
Father!

705
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:37,080
Ruler Liu.

706
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,520
What do you want me for?

707
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,469
My son is locked up.

708
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,389
He’ll no longer in our way.

709
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:51,000
You did the right thing.

710
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,760
When your family dominates Beiling,

711
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,120
your son will understand

712
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:58,190
even if he doesn’t like it.

713
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:01,470
We’re setting out tomorrow.

714
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:04,230
Is everything ready?

715
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,040
Definitely.

716
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,470
Good.

717
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,670
Ruler Liu.

718
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,910
I have to remind you.

719
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,430
You’d better not spread the truth of Liu Zong’s death.

720
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,390
Soldiers’ morale matters the most now.

721
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,630
Don’t worry.

722
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,870
During the mass pledge,

723
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,470
I told my soldiers that

724
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,120
Mu Territory colluded with Dragon Clan
and killed Liu Zong.

725
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,120
My soldiers shared a bitter hatred of the enemy,

726
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,280
and they’re in high spirits.

727
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:29,910
Good.

728
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,910
It’s wise of you.

729
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,710
Seems like my concern is misplaced.

730
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,760
Mind your own business.

731
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,560
Yes. Yes.

732
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,470
Boring.

733
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,000
Waiter.

734
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:54,870
Do you sell wine?

735
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:55,910
Sir.

736
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,760
This is a tea-stall.

737
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:58,910
I want to sell some wine to you.

738
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,600
But sorry, I don’t have any.

739
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,800
Thirsty?

740
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:15,600
Eat them

741
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:16,710
and you’ll be better.

742
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,760
Do it!

743
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,600
When are we leaving?

744
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:35,630
Right away.

745
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,560
There’s still two or three days’ walk.

746
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,870
Can’t we have more rest?

747
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,630
Didn’t she refuse to get married?

748
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,040
Why is she rushing now?

749
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,520
Shut up!

750
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,600
Welcome back.

751
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,470
Why did you stop asking?

752
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,710
What does looking help with?

753
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,800
Can you find Luo Li by looking?

754
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,630
This is the last town.

755
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,670
If we still can’t find her,

756
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,230
there’ll be the wilderness

757
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,430
out of town.

758
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,910
We have no one to ask the way.

759
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,670
What are you scared of?

760
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:17,040
You know where they’re heading for.

761
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,280
Why don’t we just lie in wait

762
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,800
at Xue God Clan’s territory?

763
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,320
It’s a long way to go to their territory.

764
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:26,040
We’ll have a battle with Dragon Palace.

765
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,230
As the Young Master,

766
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,390
I can’t leave for too long.

767
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,150
What does the hesitation help with?

768
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,470
If you want to save Luo Li,

769
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,040
do your best!

770
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,670
If you don’t,

771
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,520
go back and help your dad.

772
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,280
What are you hesitating for?

773
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,760
You’re right.

774
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,760
Excuse me, did you see a girl?

775
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:47,800
She’s beautiful

776
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:48,840
tall and thin.

777
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,430
She’s with some fierce-looking guys.

778
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,190
No.

779
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,320
Excuse me, did you see a girl?

780
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,360
She’s beautiful.

781
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,670
She’s with some fierce-looking guys.

782
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,630
No.

783
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,430
Are you looking for someone?

784
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,150
Did you see them?

785
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,430
Yes.

786
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,950
Where did they go?

787
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,000
Be specific!

788
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,150
This morning,

789
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,760
five fierce-looking guys

790
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,360
had some rest here

791
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,320
with a girl in a blue dress.

792
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,040
Those guys

793
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,710
asked me for wine.

794
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,870
But I’m selling the tea.

795
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,430
How could I have wine?

796
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,520
And then?

797
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,600
Where did they go?

798
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:37,840
That way.

799
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,150
I heard them talking about

800
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,600
Transmitting Circle on the eastern border.

801
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,560
I don’t know what that means.

802
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,120
Transmitting Circle?

803
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,040
They must want to go back to West Land

804
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,280
through it.

805
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,470
Thank you.

806
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,670
Get her here for dinner.

807
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,000
Goddess.

808
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,150
Time for dinner.

809
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,150
I’m not hungry.

810
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:23,950
Goddess.

811
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,080
Have something to eat.

812
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,120
There’s still a long way to go.

813
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,430
Don’t get ill.

814
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:33,040
Go.

815
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,710
Go and check.

816
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,000
Luckily, I took the Disguising Pill

817
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,150
my dad just made.

818
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:53,470
Otherwise,

819
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,430
I wouldn’t have come up with such a good plan.

820
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,800
But…

821
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,120
I don’t know

822
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,710
if the new pill works well.

823
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,760
What are you doing?

824
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,230
I’m asking you!

825
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,710
Done!

826
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,230
What is he doing?

827
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,760
We’re back.

828
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,360
What’s wrong over there?

829
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,320
Nothing.

830
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,000
A Taoist is making wine over there.

831
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,600
Making wine?

832
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,520
Yes.

833
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,910
We got him here.

834
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,710
Taoist.

835
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:49,520
You’re making wine here

836
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,190
in the middle of night?

837
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:52,760
Wine?

838
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,800
How naïve!

839
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,320
It’s not ordinary wine,

840
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,120
but the liquor from heaven.

841
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,360
I used to

842
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,150
travel across the world.

843
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,630
I’m all alone

844
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:04,120
and have nothing with me.

845
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,360
All I enjoy is the wine.

846
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:08,520
I’ve tasted all the wine over the world.

847
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,840
But soon I find it boring.

848
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,230
Then,

849
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:13,870
I made up my mind

850
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,430
to make my own wine.
