00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available.]


2
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,040
I’m Luo Xiu, Elder of Luo God Clan.


3
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:17,440
It’s you who we wanted.


4
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:18,790
Miss.


5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,870
May you tell me


6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,040
why you trap me


7
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:23,550
here?


8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,230
For


9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,120
the treasures given by Xue God Clan?


10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,000
You should ask Luo Tianlong.


11
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,200
I didn’t have them.


12
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,910
Do I look like a greedy miser?


13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,750
You captured me.


14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:38,880
Is it...


15
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,310
Is it because of


16
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,110
my agreement with Xue Lingzi?


17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,110
Yes,


18
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,400
it is.


19
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:49,880
People said


20
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,040
I betrayed my clan for wealth.


21
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,950
Yet Xue God Clan is powerful


22
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,040
and brutal.


23
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,430
If we fight head on,


24
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,240
our clan will be annihilated.


25
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,720
Actually,


26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,950
I’m trying to protect Luo God Clan


27
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,440
with my own way.


28
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,440
An indirect way?


29
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:09,590
That’s it.


30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,510
I can’t believe you understand


31
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,000
my mind.


32
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:14,950
Now that you understand me,


33
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,870
please let me go.


34
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,160
No way.


35
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:18,720
This...


36
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,550
This is the only way to save Luo God Clan.


37
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,039
If Xue Lingzi


38
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,000
knows I’m treacherous,


39
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,950
not to mention my clansmen,


40
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,080
even you


41
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,550
will also be implicated.


42
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,550
I said no way.


43
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,039
Take it away.


44
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,830
What?


45
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,229
It’s disgusting.


46
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:49,310
If you can’t bear the blood,


47
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,800
why bother coming here?


48
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,080
It’s you.


49
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,830
Elder Xiu.


50
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,680
You


51
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,440
clearly know what it is


52
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,080
beside your feet, don’t you?


53
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,550
I do! I do!


54
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,630
It’s Luo Tianlong’s head.


55
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:09,960
Now that...


56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,630
Now that you are so confident,


57
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,600
I will try to cooperate.


58
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,550
I will! I will!


59
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,700
The Great Ruler


60
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,660
Episode 34


61
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,670
Don’t be like this.


62
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,880
Can’t you cover it?


63
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,240
Don’t make a fuss.


64
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,080
You are timid.


65
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:06,800
Shen.


66
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,750
Did you make it?


67
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,630
What happened?


68
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,270
It’s complicated about Luo Qingya.


69
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,720
He is neither mercenary


70
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,790
like Luo Tianlong,


71
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,829
nor a fence-sitter like Luo Xiu.


72
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,350
He purely


73
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,550
holds political dissents against Leader Luo.


74
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,950
I know


75
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,000
Luo Qingya has conflicts the most


76
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,720
with the Leader among all the elders.


77
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,600
Did he tell you


78
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,000
why he submitted to Xue God Clan?


79
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,040
He thought Leader Luo selfishly


80
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,550
exchanged the future of clansmen


81
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,440
for Luo Li’s freedom.


82
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,480
No one is free in a broken city.


83
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,510
Why doesn't he understand?


84
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,230
He is headstrong.


85
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,480
He won’t accept this word.


86
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,200
What to do?


87
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,640
Shall we go again?


88
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,070
No.


89
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,440
For the first time, he respects you as a lobbyist


90
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,390
and lets you go.


91
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,070
Not the second time.


92
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,200
I will go.


93
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,320
Leader.


94
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,200
I heard what you said just now.


95
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,160
It’s too risky for you.


96
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,550
Luo Qingya is a man of honor.


97
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,320
He won’t hurt me for no reason.


98
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,200
He just sticks to his ideas


99
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,160
and ambition.


100
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,320
Leader.


101
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,670
We’ll escort you there


102
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,320
and protect you secretly.


103
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,000
No need.


104
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,480
It’s disrespectful to him.


105
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,440
Rest assured. He won’t do me harm.


106
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,320
You may take a message to him.


107
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,790
I’ll talk to him face to face.


108
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,000
But you are wanted in the city.


109
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,200
It’s OK.


110
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,230
I have my own way.


111
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,760
Mr. Mu.


112
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,070
Mr. Mu.


113
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,510
What brings you here, Qingshan?


114
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,350
Luo God Clan is in danger.


115
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,040
North Sect has mobilized all the forces


116
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,110
to save Luo Li.


117
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,480
They sent me back


118
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,350
for your reinforcement.


119
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,110
Where is Mu Chen?


120
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,720
On the way to Luo God Clan.


121
00:05:59,320 --> 00:05:59,720
Zhou Ye.


122
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,110
You hold the fort here.


123
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,670
Send 50 top masters to Luo God Clan.


124
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,550
I’ll go with Qingshan first.


125
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,550
Yes.


126
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,000
Let’s go.


127
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,920
You are still blaming me.


128
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,510
Leader.


129
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,880
It’s stubborn of you.


130
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,070
You still


131
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,480
don’t admit your mistake.


132
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,000
We’re both stubborn.


133
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,950
That's why we've been fighting.


134
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,600
Qingya.


135
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,480
You are still young...


136
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,600
Leader.


137
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,390
The judgment for future


138
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,270
has nothing to do with age.


139
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,830
If no present,


140
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,480
where is the future?


141
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,350
Do you know


142
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,350
what the present situation is?


143
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,350
Leader.


144
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,230
If you still pull rank,


145
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,440
I will


146
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,440
take my leave.


147
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,040
Qingya.


148
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,640
Xue God Clan is in friction with us
for millennium,


149
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,790
nip and tuck.


150
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,920
Even if either side wins,


151
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,880
it never means to eliminate the other.


152
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,160
Do you know


153
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,390
why their power surges now


154
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,390
and invades our clan?


155
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,110
Why?


156
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:42,110
Because Xue God Clan colludes with Evil Deity.


157
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,640
Are you sure?


158
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,200
Luo Li assassinated Xue Lingzi


159
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,320
on the altar the other day.


160
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,790
Many witnessed it.


161
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,350
I’m not spreading rumors.


162
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,760
You can check it yourself.


163
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,760
Leader.


164
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,600
I promise you.


165
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,230
I’m old.


166
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,230
Among the next generation,


167
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,880
you are loyal and


168
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,350
dependable the most.


169
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,390
After we expel Xue God Clan,


170
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,270
the position of leader


171
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,480
will be yours.


172
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,600
Saving Luo Li


173
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,280
and expelling Xue God Clan


174
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,840
is my duty.


175
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,200
It’s not trading.


176
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,640
Leader.


177
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,669
Don’t do that.


178
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:38,030
No,


179
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,590
it’s not trading .


180
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,669
Our Luo God Clan


181
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,470
is at a critical moment.


182
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,280
From now on,


183
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,840
you must shoulder the heavy responsibility.


184
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,590
Considering morality,


185
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,150
only you and Luo Li


186
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,400
are trustworthy.


187
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,760
But Luo Li is too emotional,


188
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,400
not suitable to be leader.


189
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,030
Only you,


190
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,110
rational and restrained,


191
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,110
are the best candidate.


192
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,760
Thanks for your kindness, leader.


193
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,230
Given the clan rules,


194
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,760
the position of leader


195
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,910
shall be inherited by Luo Li.


196
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,790
I will abide by rules


197
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,550
and assist her all out.


198
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,670
Good.


199
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,320
What took you so long?


200
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,590
Tomorrow is the last day of three-day deadline.


201
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,590
Anyway, we are here.


202
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,320
Don't dwell on the trivial.


203
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:43,670
Well.


204
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,350
Did you meet Bai Tong?


205
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,280
He left the Sect


206
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,550
once you and Jiuyou left.


207
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:49,960
Yes,


208
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,910
at Land of Beasts.


209
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,350
However,


210
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,440
he was killed by Wen Qingxuan.


211
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,470
How is it going?


212
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,400
We’ve persuaded two elders of Luo God Clan


213
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,440
and got rid of the traitor.


214
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,470
By that time


215
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,110
they will cooperate with us.


216
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,150
What about Luo Li?


217
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,200
Is she OK?


218
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:15,760
She


219
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,350
will marry Xue Lingzi tomorrow.


220
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,320
Mu Chen.


221
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,710
This is Luo Tianhe, Luo God Clan’s leader.


222
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:27,710
Greetings.


223
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,590
Are you Mu Chen?


224
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,230
Yes.


225
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,960
Come out with me, please.


226
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,640
Mu Chen.


227
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,640
I’ve heard all about you and Luo Li.


228
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,520
Do you know that humans can’t


229
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,790
love Gods?


230
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,640
Yes. I know.


231
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,030
That means


232
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,550
even if you save Luo Li,


233
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,350
our Luo God Clan


234
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,320
won’t marry her to you.


235
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,760
You understand?


236
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,640
Yes, I do.


237
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,590
In this case,


238
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,840
will you still take the risks to save her?


239
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,640
Yes, I will.


240
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:18,590
OK.


241
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,230
Chap.


242
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,320
Many thanks.


243
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,960
Luo Li, you are so beautiful.


244
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,590
Luo Li.


245
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,550
The three-day deadline is due.


246
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,000
Mu Chen doesn’t come.


247
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,550
Are you upset?


248
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,880
That human brat fears death.


249
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,000
All his oaths are lies.


250
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,400
Now


251
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,150
you know my kindness?


252
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,790
Goddess, please have tea.


253
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,790
Xue Lingzi.


254
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,670
Aren’t you aware that


255
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,150
you are driving your people to a dead end?


256
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,760
You think you are cooperating with Evil Deity.


257
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:21,960
Actually,


258
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,080
you’re nothing but his pawn.


259
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,350
Don't you understand?


260
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,400
Luo Li.


261
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,470
If you don’t want me to do this,


262
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,550
I will not.


263
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,230
I accept Evil Deity’s power


264
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,640
absolutely for you.


265
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,640
Neither the world,


266
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,110
nor Evil Deity,


267
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,640
I don’t care about them at all.


268
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,840
You


269
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,790
are my only concern.


270
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,230
Don’t feel upset for that brat.


271
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,150
You have me in future.


272
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,880
Let’s do the ceremony.


273
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,590
Mu Chen.


274
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,640
What to do now?


275
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,790
Futu Clan


276
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,350
may be also like this.


277
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,230
It’s found.


278
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,670
This way.


279
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,110
Let’s go.


280
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,840
Mu Chen.


281
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,790
It’s me.


282
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,840
I gave you the opportunity,


283
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,520
but the time was due.


284
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,320
You’ve lost the chance.


285
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,200
The sun has not set yet.


286
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,280
Today isn’t over.


287
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,030
Xue Lingzi.


288
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,550
Although you played dirty tricks,


289
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,710
at least you didn’t hurt Luo Li.


290
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,710
I thank you


291
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,030
for that.


292
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,550
Luo Li.


293
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,400
I won’t give up on you.


294
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,150
Promise me and I’ll let him off.


295
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,000
We have to act.


296
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,320
Mu Chen.


297
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,640
I won't kill him.


298
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,960
I just gave him a lesson.


299
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:54,670
Mu Chen.


300
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,760
You are all here.


301
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,030
Bring it on.


302
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,150
Let them go.


303
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,200
What did you say?


304
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,470
I said


305
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,520
let them go.


306
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,320
Mu Chen.


307
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,000
Leave.


308
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,910
I am willing to marry Xue Lingzi.


309
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,550
You can't save me.


310
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,400
Don't come again.


311
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:57,960
Mu Chen.


312
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,080
Mu Chen, wake up!


313
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:02,960
Mu Chen.


314
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,829
Mu Chen.


315
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,000
Seeing this


316
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,230
is seeing me.


317
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,160
I’ll wait for you in Luo City.


318
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,470
Next time we meet,


319
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:28,430
I’ll show you more


320
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,950
beautiful Rosemary Circles.


321
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,040
Are you


322
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,190
satisfied now?


323
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,230
Let them all go.


324
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,760
Leader. Do not let them go.


325
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,350
If Evil Deity knows this,


326
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,070
our people will suffer.


327
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,190
Xue Lingzi.


328
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,950
Will you eat your words?


329
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:07,830
Leave!


330
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,040
Leave!


331
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,190
Xuantong!


332
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,070
Xuantong!


333
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,560
Liu Mubai.


334
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,920
Do you agree to take in charge of Tuling Guards?


335
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,430
I have unfinished business to do.


336
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,680
Please give me


337
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,520
some more time.


338
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,000
I can’t really understand


339
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,880
your humans’ affairs.


340
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,110
Godfather.


341
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,800
Let him go.


342
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:48,950
After all, he isn’t always with you as I am.


343
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,920
Qingxuan. We may change the strategy.


344
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,640
Godfather.


345
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,280
You mean...


346
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,680
I’m about to revive.


347
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,310
Leave Mu Chen aside for now.


348
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,640
Why?


349
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,680
After I return to the world,


350
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,710
how can that Mu Chen stop me?


351
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,680
Even a hundred of him


352
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,400
won’t be my match.


353
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,590
Yes.


354
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,830
I know.


355
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,520
Who are you?


356
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,470
Where am I?


357
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,230
If we can save White Horse City,


358
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,710
make roast for me.


359
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,350
What is this?


360
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,040
It’s Double-winged White Horse.


361
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,640
I wish


362
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,040
you could forget all the unhappiness


363
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,280
when you see it.


364
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,520
Luo Li ever told me


365
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,350
if you love someone,


366
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,160
you are willing to die for him.


367
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,760
I didn’t understand back then.


368
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,160
Bai Tong!


369
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,160
Leave!


370
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,070
Qian’er.


371
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:31,920
Mu Chen.


372
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,430
Mu Chen.


373
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,590
Be careful.


374
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,280
Shen.


375
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,950
What happened?


376
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,830
Shen.


377
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,280
Shen.


378
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,190
Wake up!


379
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,110
Shen.


380
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:55,640
Mu Chen.


381
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,830
What happened to you?


382
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,470
It’s all my fault.


383
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,640
Mu Chen.


384
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,000
Mu Chen, what's wrong with you?


385
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,310
What’s wrong?


386
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,680
What’s wrong? Tell me.


387
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,040
What happened to you?


388
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:13,400
Mu Chen.


389
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:15,830
All my fault.


390
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,350
All my fault.


391
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,760
Mu Chen.


392
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,640
Leave.


393
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,710
I am willing to marry Xue Lingzi.


394
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,230
Impossible.


395
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,000
Shen.


396
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,710
Is your injury better?


397
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,000
I’ve been through worse.


398
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,230
It’s no big deal.


399
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,000
Where is Mu Chen?


400
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,800
How is he?


401
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,110
He


402
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,310
locks himself in the room and practices.


403
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,760
He doesn’t listen to me at all.


404
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,280
Practice?


405
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,880
His power has been in disorder.


406
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,110
Now the failure upsets him.


407
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,280
If he gets demonized,


408
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,590
it will be catastrophic.


409
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,830
Shen. Don’t move.


410
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,560
You are very weak now.


411
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,880
You need rest.


412
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,520
But Mu Chen...


413
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,520
Leave it to me.


414
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,040
I’m going to talk with him.


415
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,230
Qian’er.


416
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:35,800
Yes?


417
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,350
Be sure to calm him down.


418
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:40,800
OK.


419
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:00,920
Mu Chen.


420
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:03,430
Mu Chen, stop practicing.


421
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,040
Take a break.


422
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,590
Take a break first.


423
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,950
Qian’er.


424
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,800
I’m a loser, right?


425
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,400
I failed to protect schoolmates


426
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,400
and the Sect.


427
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,560
I failed to keep Mubai.


428
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:25,470
Now


429
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,920
I have to survive by sacrificing Luo Li.


430
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,680
No. Mu Chen.


431
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,190
These things couldn’t


432
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,590
be stopped by you alone.


433
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,190
You’ve done your best.


434
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,560
Don’t blame yourself.


435
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:37,800
This is all because of


436
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,190
my recklessness.


437
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,040
Mu Chen.


438
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,590
I am a loser.


439
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,800
You can't save me.


440
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,400
Don't come again.


441
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,710
That day


442
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,470
I lost everything.


443
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,000
It all thanks to you.


444
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,110
I am a loser


445
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,310
who can do nothing.


446
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,560
I don't love you anymore.


447
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,880
Don't annoy me again.


448
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,900
[Mubai]


449
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,310
Mubai.


450
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,350
Mubai.


451
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,470
You are here.


452
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,040
Don't leave.


453
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,110
Mubai.


454
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:31,230
Mubai.


455
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:34,710
Mubai.


456
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:37,710
Don't leave.


457
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,110
You gave it to me.


458
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,400
It’s returned to you now.


459
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,350
My vein.


460
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,310
Mubai.


461
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,280
Qian’er.


462
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,590
Qian’er.


463
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,190
Mr. Mu.


464
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,160
Qian’er.


465
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,280
How come your hair changed back?


466
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:16,560
Mubai came back.


467
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:17,640
Liu Mubai?


468
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,470
Where is he now?


469
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,830
Qingshan. Easy.


470
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,680
Let Qian’er finish her words.


471
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,400
When I fell into sleep,


472
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,920
I felt a stream of familiar power.


473
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,280
I thought I was dreaming.


474
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,070
When I woke up,


475
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,560
I found my vein was back.


476
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,040
The only possibility is that


477
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,190
he returned my vein back.


478
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,520
That traitor.


479
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,760
He must be


480
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:48,880
up to something to do this.


481
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:49,350
No.


482
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:50,950
I believe


483
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:53,230
Liu Mubai still has good conscience,


484
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,520
at least to Qian’er.


485
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,430
Sun’er?


486
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,400
Where is Sun’er?


487
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,350
They were all trapped by Xue Lingzi.


488
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,800
Only Mu Chen


489
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,680
and Shen fled back.


490
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:05,760
What?


491
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,230
I'm going to save her.


492
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,310
Qingshan.


493
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,000
I know you are anxious,


494
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,560
but don’t be impulsive.


495
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,070
Mr. Mu.


496
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,800
Sun’er is in great danger.


497
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,710
I know.


498
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,710
Trust me.


499
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,400
Let’s see Chen first.


500
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,070
Go.


501
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,350
Let's go.


502
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:32,640
Mu Chen.


503
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,640
What's wrong with you?


504
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,470
Qingshan.


505
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,350
He’s been like this since the mission failed.


506
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:38,950
I talked to him


507
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,590
but he didn’t listen.


508
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,190
Qian’er.


509
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:46,950
Qingshan.


510
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,400
You may go back first.


511
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,520
I'll go talk with Chen.


512
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,560
Do you remember


513
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,230
what I told you about your mother?


514
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,350
You asked me


515
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,920
why I didn’t save her.


516
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,000
I told you


517
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,710
because I couldn’t.


518
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,280
That’s why


519
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,310
I lost Yanjing.


520
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,520
I saw her leave me.


521
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,160
But I’m telling you,


522
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,950
I never intend to give up.


523
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,350
If you love Luo Li,


524
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,470
stop complaining and blaming yourself.


525
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,680
Humans


526
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,070
shall stand between heaven and earth,


527
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,590
not crawling.


528
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,590
Only we stand


529
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,920
can we hold up our world.


530
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,590
You ever guarded our city


531
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,710
alone


532
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:00,640
and made it.


533
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,310
How can you give up early this time?


534
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:05,830
Chen.


535
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,470
You have grown up.


536
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,830
You’re capable to protect more people,


537
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,350
so people respectfully regard you as leader.


538
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:13,800
Since


539
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,430
you are at the position,


540
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,110
you shall shoulder


541
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,310
the responsibility accordingly,


542
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,950
no evading,


543
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,190
no giving up.


544
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,230
Or else, once you are defeated,


545
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,070
all the people


546
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,000
will die because of you.


547
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:42,920
The more capable you are, the bigger your duty is.


548
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,710
Face it,


549
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,350
and challenge it.


550
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,590
You have no way back.


551
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:57,430
Father.


552
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,880
I see.


553
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,909
I believe you.


554
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:14,949
Come back early.


555
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,520
Luo Li.


556
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,360
Are you still thinking about


557
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,280
that vulnerable human brat?


558
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,670
Luo Li.


559
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,390
My heart to you is true.


560
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,560
You promised me to let them go,


561
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,000
yet you went back on your word.


562
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,430
How can I believe you?


563
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:18,520
Luo Li.


564
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,520
They are all mortal enemies of Evil Deity.


565
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,630
If I don’t do this,


566
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,710
you and I,


567
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,190
and all clansmen will die.


568
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,040
You have my word.


569
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,670
After we get married,


570
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,230
I’ll release them secretly.


571
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,150
Alright?


572
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,120
How are you feeling?


573
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,040
Much better.


574
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:29,800
Father.


575
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,630
Mu Chen.


576
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,280
You look much better.


577
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,230
The injury has healed,


578
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,190
but my power hasn’t recovered yet.


579
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,230
Father.


580
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:44,950
Qingshan.


581
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,360
Qian’er.


582
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,910
I have something to tell you.


583
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,000
I’m listening.


584
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:52,910
I'm going to Luo City.


585
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,320
What?


586
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,630
I'll go with you.


587
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,190
No.


588
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,430
I'll go alone.


589
00:36:58,910 --> 00:36:59,430
Mu Chen.


590
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,910
We know you are anxious.


591
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,760
If you go alone,


592
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,360
you’ll get into their trap.


593
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,230
That’s right.


594
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,560
Chen.


595
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,600
Hold your horses now.


596
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,150
You should take actions,


597
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:11,910
but


598
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,320
think twice first.


599
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,800
Do not act rashly.


600
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:15,430
Father.


601
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,840
I’m not reckless.


602
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,910
Since Xue Lingzi believes he has succeeded,


603
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,040
I will take him by surprise.


604
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,360
And


605
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,430
how can I allow Luo Li to marry him?


606
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:29,630
What’s your plan?


607
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:30,800
I’ll try to


608
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,560
demoralize Xue God Clan.


609
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,190
When they panic,


610
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,150
I’ll send signal by circles.


611
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,710
And then


612
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,560
you muster all forces


613
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,760
to attack the gate.


614
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,560
This is our only chance.


615
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,390
You have a plan already.


616
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:50,840
OK.


617
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,000
I have your back.


618
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,230
Just do it.


619
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,600
Bro.


620
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,360
Go and get Luo Li back.


621
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,520
Leave the rest


622
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:01,910
to us.


623
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,600
Qian’er.


624
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:05,950
I have something to tell you.


625
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,120
What?


626
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,600
He came back yesterday.


627
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,390
Did you see him?


628
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:23,430
No.


629
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,710
I had a feeling.


630
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,360
Qian’er.


631
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,040
Since he could come and give your vein back,


632
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,560
he could also kill me,


633
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,760
but he didn’t.


634
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:35,560
What


635
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,230
does it mean?


636
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,360
You mean...


637
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,150
I said


638
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,230
I’ll take back that previous Liu Mubai.


639
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,150
Trust me.


640
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:10,280
Luo Li.


641
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,040
From now on,


642
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,670
the feud between our clans


643
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,320
is settled once for all.


644
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,320
And I


645
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,040
can finally


646
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,840
be with you.


647
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,630
You'd better keep your word.


648
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,520
I will convince you that


649
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,390
being with me


650
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,870
is your optimal choice.


651
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,760
Go check it.


652
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,390
Yes.


653
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:02,600
Is it risky?


654
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,710
Qingshan.


655
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,320
Qian’er.


656
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,710
Jiuyou.


657
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,870
Jiuyou.


658
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,710
Have you recovered?


659
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,120
Yes, much better.


660
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,080
This is...


661
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,080
My name is Man Tuluo.


662
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:16,950
She is awesome.


663
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:17,950
Hadn’t she


664
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,910
helped me at Land of Beasts,


665
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:20,800
you wouldn’t


666
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,430
be able to see me again.


667
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,630
Ms. Man is so capable.


668
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,520
Where is Mu Chen?


669
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,870
To be a hero.


670
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,470
Did he go to save Luo Li?


671
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,840
He


672
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,470
doesn’t fear death indeed.


673
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,710
Don’t worry.


674
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,040
We’re waiting for his signal


675
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,950
to reinforce timely.


676
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,190
Fine.


677
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,280
Go.


678
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,470

I'm not afraid.


682
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,080

00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,150
