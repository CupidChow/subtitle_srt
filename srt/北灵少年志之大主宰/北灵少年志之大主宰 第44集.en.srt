1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available.]


2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,350
It took me ten years


3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,070
to move heaven and earth


4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,680
to build the Devil-dissipating Circle


5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,440
in order to destroy Evil Deity.


6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,000
I won’t fail


7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,360
even without others’ help.


8
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:26,200
OK.


9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:27,710
I see.


10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,070
Father.


11
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,120
Please guard the Circle.


12
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:32,790
I’ll lure Evil Deity in.


13
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:33,790
Fine.


14
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,150
Don’t do anything stupid.


15
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,680
I won’t.


16
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:53,880
Once Evil Deity shows up,


17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,430
I’ll draw him into the circle.


18
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,590
Nonsense.


19
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,000
My flexibility


20
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,950
makes me the fittest.


21
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:00,590
Jiuyou,


22
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,360
you're always self-willed,


23
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,160
but you have principles.


24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,830
I don’t care what happened


25
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,000
but you spoiled


26
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,720
our chance to win today.


27
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,550
Evil Deity’s target is me.


28
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,590
Only I can trap him.


29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,360
Mu Chen!


30
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,120
What are you doing?


31
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:21,680
Jiuyou.


32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,720
Mu Chen!


33
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:23,910
You made a mistake


34
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,760
and will be confined here for a day.


35
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,000
I’ll let you out tomorrow.


36
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,120
You can punish me all you want,


37
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,190
but...


38
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,270
but wait


39
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,479
after we defeat Tuling Guards,


40
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,680
OK?


41
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,460
The Great Ruler


42
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,460
Episode 44


43
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,550
Shen Cangsheng.


44
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,160
You again!


45
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,390
Wen Qingxuan.


46
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,030
You've invaded our sect


47
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,910
over and over.


48
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,670
As the active headmaster,


49
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,630
it’s my duty to stop you.


50
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,829
Today is your last day


51
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,630
serving as the headmaster.


52
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:00,830
He’s here.


53
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,160
So far,


54
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,960
we’ve taken back a few places.


55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,630
Devil-dissipating Circle can be activated anytime.


56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,550
Rest assured.


57
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,720
I’ll lead him into it.


58
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,520
I’ll wait for you at the Circle.


59
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,390
Do take care of yourself.


60
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,350
You’re our only hope.


61
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,640
Sir!


62
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,760
Sir!


63
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,950
Sir!


64
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,110
Sir!


65
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,000
My decades of practice


66
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,920
is still no match for Evil Deity’s one strike.


67
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,790
I’m fine. I won’t die.


68
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,160
Is the center of the Circle in our hands?


69
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:23,880
It is.


70
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,480
Once Chen lures Evil Deity here,


71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,830
we’ll activate the Circle.


72
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,950
Good.


73
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,670
Are you Mu Chen?


74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,550
I am.


75
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,510
We’ve finally met in person.


76
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,350
Since I came back,


77
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,110
you’re the first person who isn’t afraid of me.


78
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,270
You're hideous.


79
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,760
Rude!


80
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,880
I can’t believe God sent


81
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,480
a baby like you to battle me.


82
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,200
Ridiculous!


83
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,159
Is it?


84
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,000
Let’s find out.


85
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,720
Qian’er.


86
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:38,950
Step back!


87
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,000
Qian’er.


88
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,830
I’m here to apologize.


89
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,720
I took the wrong path,


90
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,950
betrayed all my friends


91
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,790
and you.


92
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,390
I’m guilty.


93
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,230
I’m not doing this


94
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,789
because of our engagement.


95
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,150
I know you.


96
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,880
If you disliked it,


97
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,760
you’d turn it down.


98
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,590
From now on,


99
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,150
no one


100
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,960
can disturb our lives.


101
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,470
It’s Mu Chen!


102
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,910
He managed to lure Evil Deity here.


103
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,030
His talent is indeed unparalleled.


104
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,520
Ready to activate


105
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,150
the Devil-dissipating Circle.


106
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,000
Yes.


107
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,880
You're losing.


108
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,080
Stop struggling.


109
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,400
I can give you a quick death.


110
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,590
As for those people,


111
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,640
they’ll soon


112
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,590
join you.


113
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,640
You can try.


114
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,760
It’s too late


115
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,230
to regret now.


116
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,470
What a cute couple!


117
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,320
I kinda envy you.


118
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,320
You really think


119
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,640
I pushed you


120
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,110
to come this far


121
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,280
and once you right your wrongs,


122
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,910
you can still


123
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,640
be that selfless hero?


124
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,280
At this stage,


125
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,230
do your regrets matter?


126
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,670
Idiot.


127
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,150
Once we become the ultimate winner,


128
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,880
you’ll gain everything you want.


129
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,030
Since I was little,


130
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,350
I've determined to shoulder our family,


131
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,440
become a master


132
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,080
and marry a woman I love.


133
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,320
Our family motto is


134
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,760
to be just and selfless.


135
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,030
Praise virtue and punish vice.


136
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,150
That’s the foundation of Liu Territory.


137
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,320
All these years,


138
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,320
I’ve never forgotten about that.


139
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,350
Yet one misstep


140
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,550
leads to a trail of more.


141
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,350
I couldn’t


142
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,230
save Liu Territory.


143
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,670
Mr. Zhu Tian and Lord White Dragon


144
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,080
passed away because of me.


145
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,030
In order to gain power,


146
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,350
I sided with Evil Deity


147
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,910
and commanded Tuling Guards.


148
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,790
I tried to protect you


149
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,590
but only saw our distance


150
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,110
becoming farther and farther.


151
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,230
No more crying.


152
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,400
I've lost everything.


153
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,710
I won't


154
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,590
allow my wife and child


155
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,710
to die here.


156
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,790
Mubai!


157
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,910
Mubai!


158
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,910
Liu Mubai.


159
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,080
How dare you betray father!


160
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,030
It’s OK.


161
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,200
You think you can kill me


162
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,710
with one arm?


163
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,710
No!


164
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,080
How did this happen?


165
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,640
Jiuyou!


166
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,030
Are you alright?


167
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,440
I'm fine.


168
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,670
It's you!


169
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:49,910
Father.


170
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,910
Uncle Mu.


171
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:04,960
Zhou Ye.


172
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,230
Lord.


173
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,440
Take care.


174
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:11,790
Fare...


175
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,760
Farewell.


176
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,670
Zhou Ye!


177
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,910
Great Futu Pagoda.


178
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,760
Hold the Circle!


179
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:49,760
Mu Chen!


180
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,000
Bastard!


181
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,790
Mother?


182
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,200
Chen.


183
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,320
This is the last thing I can do for you.


184
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,200
Take care of yourself.


185
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,710
Qing Yanjing.


186
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,790
Nice to meet you again.


187
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,590
This is


188
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,670
merely a shred of your soul.


189
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,320
What can it do?


190
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,280
Mu Feng.


191
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,550
Mother!


192
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,080
Jing.


193
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,760
Devil-dissipating Circle


194
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:10,110
is fueled


195
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,760
by soul and blood.


196
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,710
Jing.


197
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,550
I guess this is


198
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,470
inevitable for us.


199
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,030
Father.


200
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,520
Mr. Mu!


201
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,000
Chen.


202
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,470
For the safety of the world,


203
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,440
you must carry on with your life.


204
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,790
Your mother and I


205
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,880
are always with you.


206
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,000
Father!


207
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:37,880
Father!


208
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,400
Father!


209
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,640
Mu Chen!


210
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,070
Stand up.


211
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,230
The war isn’t over yet.


212
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,400
Don’t disappoint your father.


213
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,350
Mu Chen!


214
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,950
Evil Deity.


215
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,880
I will kill you!


216
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,520
You aren’t the first one


217
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,040
to claim that.


218
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,950
Just so you know,


219
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,920
those who said that


220
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,710
all died in my hands.


221
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,350
Really?


222
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,590
Such strong power!


223
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,160
Once I kill you,


224
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,710
your power will be useless.


225
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,280
You’re only half right.


226
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,640
Today


227
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,190
will be your deathday.


228
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,190
I’m Evil Deity.


229
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,800
I’ll never die.


230
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,160
What could a human like you


231
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,400
do to me?


232
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,800
I can crush you!


233
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,110
Are you OK?


234
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,470
I’m fine.


235
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,880
Well done!


236
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,640
It seems


237
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,160
that he didn’t let us down.


238
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,430
He’s never let us down.


239
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,830
Impossible!


240
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,280
No.


241
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,520
It’s not true.


242
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,640
How could father die?


243
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,160
I see.


244
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,880
No one is wiser than father.


245
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,800
I’ll go check them.


246
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,230
Go ahead.


247
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,760
Wait here for me.


248
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,230
Mu Chen.


249
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,400
It’s OK to cry.


250
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,190
Just let it out.


251
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,430
Father said


252
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,920
if I cried,


253
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,880
the soul of the deceased


254
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,310
couldn’t leave.


255
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:24,920
He simply left


256
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,160
to be with my mother.


257
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,950
Yan Emperor


258
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,000
asked me about the next step.


259
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,190
What should we do next?


260
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,040
Evil Deity is gone,


261
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,160
but Tuling Guards are still alive.


262
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,590
To ensure world peace in the long term,


263
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,400
I’ll give it my all


264
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,400
to wipe out the remaining Tuling Guards.


265
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,920
God prophesied


266
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,920
that there would be nine eyes.


267
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,350
Eight are out already.


268
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,070
One is still unseen.


269
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,800
Those eight eyes have been destroyed,


270
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,280
but we still haven’t found the Eye of Void.


271
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,110
Do you mean...


272
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,430
The real crisis


273
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,070
hasn’t be solved yet.


274
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,800
Mu Chen eliminated Evil Deity.


275
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,190
We all saw that.


276
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,680
Nevertheless,


277
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,710
the Eye of Void


278
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,470
must be shattered.


279
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,520
Where can we


280
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,110
find it?


281
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,880
What you killed is merely my duplication.


282
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,880
The real me is still alive.


283
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,880
Once I carve my name on the Firmament Rank,


284
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,160
no one in this world


285
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,040
can defeat me.


286
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,190
Who are you?


287
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:25,710
Me?


288
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,350
Why don’t you take a guess?


289
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,190
Only God and Evil Deity


290
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,230
own this level of power.


291
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,640
Evil Deity is at the Firmament Rank


292
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,470
of Tailing Ancient Clan.


293
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,230
Come immediately.


294
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,110
Your parents are great people.


295
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,160
Now, they're finally reunited.


296
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,230
No one can separate them again.


297
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,400
Father.


298
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,950
I failed to protect you.


299
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,190
Mu Chen.


300
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,560
Don’t say that.


301
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,800
You did well enough.


302
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,800
You’re already capable of Quintuple Purity.


303
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:21,640
Were your father alive,


304
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:23,430
he’d be proud of you.


305
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,280
I’ll avenge you and mother’s deaths.


306
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,190
Mu Chen.


307
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,160
We’ll help you.


308
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,040
Have you mastered


309
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,310
those skills taught by Yan Emperor


310
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,710
and Duel Ancestor?


311
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,160
Although we can’t use them freely,


312
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,710
we've grasped the drift.


313
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,190
Don’t you trust me?


314
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:47,920
Mu Chen.


315
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,590
Leader Luo Qingya


316
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,110
sent us a message from Luo Li.


317
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,280
She said


318
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,040
Evil Deity is at the Firmament Rank


319
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,230
of Tailing Ancient Clan


320
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,230
and asked us to go there immediately.


321
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,230
No way.


322
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,950
How could he still be alive?


323
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,710
We saw him being killed ourselves.


324
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,350
I’m afraid we only destroyed


325
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,110
his duplication.


326
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,230
Five thousand years ago,


327
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,710
he was already above the supreme level


328
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,880
and was as powerful


329
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,800
as Evil Deity himself.


330
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,190
Evil Deity


331
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,110
is trying to absorb more power through that Rank.


332
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,280
One of Duel Ancestor’s skills


333
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,400
can break the space


334
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,230
to teleport people to another place.


335
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,000
Qingshan.


336
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,040
Work with me.


337
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:28,560
Sure.


338
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:29,560
No problem.


339
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,160
Sun’er,


340
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,710
you’d better stay


341
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,230
and wait for our return.


342
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,880
God of Heaven,


343
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,520
up till now,


344
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,400
you're still not my match.


345
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,230
Why can’t it be formed?


346
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,040
As the head of the three ancient clans,


347
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,590
Tailing has been guarding the Rank for centuries.


348
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,470
The evil


349
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,880
cannot touch it.


350
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,040
It’s you!


351
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,230
I didn’t expect you’d come so quickly


352
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,310
to receive your deaths.


353
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:43,950
Luo Li.


354
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,110
Are you alright?


355
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:45,710
Shut up!


356
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,760
Who are you?


357
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,590
Child’s play.


358
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,040
I’ll slaughter all of you.


359
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,640
Don’t feel too good about yourself.


360
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,060
[Tailing Ancient Clan]


361
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,110
Luo Li.


362
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,040
Luo Li.


363
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,070
Who are you?


364
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,680
How could you be so rude?


365
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,280
What's the matter?


366
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,640
What’s this tone?


367
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,760
Young man,


368
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:55,230
she’s the Goddess of Tailing.


369
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,160
You mistook her for others.


370
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,400
Luo Li.


371
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:03,800
Mu Chen.


372
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,280
We should leave.


373
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:07,880
Mu Chen.


374
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,560
Luo Li.


375
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,040
Everyone, thank you


376
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,830
for coming all the way


377
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,190
to save our clan.


378
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,000
The crisis is over,


379
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,190
but we’re too busy


380
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,280
to receive you.


381
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,400
So...


382
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:40,880
Where are your manners?


383
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,950
We came a long way


384
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,160
to help you.


385
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,560
Now, you’re kicking us out?


386
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,430
Luo Li.


387
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,190
you don’t remember him?


388
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,400
He’s Mu Chen.


389
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,560
You two...


390
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,040
Qingshan.


391
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,430
Behave yourself.


392
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,400
You really don’t recognize me?


393
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,070
You mistook me for someone else.


394
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,310
You made a mistake.


395
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,680
She’s no longer the one you remembered.


396
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,760
How did this happen?


397
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,800
Now, she’s the Goddess of Tailing.


398
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,000
But she’s still Luo Li.


399
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,280
Thank you


400
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,470
for all your help today.


401
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,350
As the Goddess,


402
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,830
everything I say and do


403
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,160
represents our clan.


404
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,400
Please stop badgering me


405
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,920
and ruining my reputation.


406
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,000
Fine.


407
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:43,950
Let’s go.


408
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,430
Goodbye.


409
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:14,280
Are you feeling unwell?


410
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,560
I’m fine.


411
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:35,680
Goddess.


412
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:36,800
Are you OK?


413
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,830
Just now,


414
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,950
my heart ached somehow.


415
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,710
My power isn’t running smoothly.


416
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,350
That’s probably because you were severely injured.


417
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,280
No.


418
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,430
I feel upset


419
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,230
as if there were an untied knot


420
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,190
that congested my chest,


421
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,760
causing the unsmooth power circulation.


422
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,710
Goddess.


423
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,230
You still haven’t recovered yet.


424
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,110
You need to rest.


425
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:08,280
Grand Master,


426
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,880
did I


427
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,590
meet that man who came today?


428
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:15,950
Never.


429
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,710
If so,


430
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,520
why do I feel I’m attached to him?


431
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,590
When I saw him,


432
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,590
I found him familiar


433
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,640
and even wanted to go with him.


434
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,280
Last time, when I saw Li Xuantong,


435
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,400
I already


436
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,950
found him slightly familiar


437
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,710
but that feeling wasn’t strong.


438
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:42,280
I didn’t think it was real


439
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,470
until I saw that person.


440
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,680
I knew


441
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,110
I had met him before


442
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,520
and we had been close.


443
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,880
But however hard I think,


444
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,190
I can’t remember anything.


445
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:58,710
Goddess.


446
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,280
Evil Deity’s power is strong


447
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,160
and can affect others’ minds.


448
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,000
That must be the cause


449
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,520
of your depression.


450
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,120
You’ll be fine after some rest.


451
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:11,520
Are you sure?


452
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,630
Goddess.


453
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,120
Evil Deity is back.


454
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,710
If we're distracted by these little things,


455
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,389
we’ll fall right into Evil Deity’s trap.


456
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,000
Our priority


457
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,190
is to rehabilitate


458
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:26,870
so that we’ll have enough strength


459
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:30,280
to fight again.


460
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,560
You’re right.


461
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,000
Qian’er.


462
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:50,870
It’s time to eat.


463
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:11,320
Evil Deity is indeed formidable.


464
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,470
With no duplications


465
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:14,840
and a damaged body,


466
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,390
his power was as strong


467
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,600
as ours combined.


468
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,360
We only won by a narrow margin.


469
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,230
I’m afraid


470
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,560
it’ll be much harder


471
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,670
to eliminate him.


472
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,150
Once everything settles down,


473
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,230
I’ll practice hard to strive for a breakthrough.


474
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:35,470
Mu Chen.


475
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:36,870
What’s that supposed to mean?


476
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,560
Destroying Evil Deity


477
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,800
isn’t just your duty.


478
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,560
You still have us.


479
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:42,950
Besides,


480
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,120
Cangsheng and I have been practicing


481
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,430
Yan Emperor and Duel Ancestor’s skills.


482
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,080
Although we’re


483
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,470
only half as skilled,


484
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,800
as long as we practice hard,


485
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,600
we’ll catch up with them.


486
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:54,670
Right,


487
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,390
Cangsheng?


488
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:57,320
Mu Chen.


489
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,040
Don’t push yourself too hard.


490
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,280
I know what I’m doing.


491
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:12,390
Mu Chen.


492
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,840
You've been reading for hours.


493
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:14,600
Eat something.


494
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,710
I’m not hungry.


495
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:16,670
Leave it there.


496
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:17,560
Yeah.


497
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,230
You still need to eat.


498
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,760
Right now, Heaven Palace


499
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:24,670
is leaderless.


500
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,120
This is our best chance to wipe out Tuling Guards.


501
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,430
There’s no time to waste.


502
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,800
Mu Chen.


503
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,800
Do you want everyone


504
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,040
to worry about you?


505
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:33,910
What’s to worry?


506
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,080
I’m fine.


507
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,280
I still need to take revenge


508
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,360
for my parents.


509
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:07,040
Follow me.


510
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,600
What’s up?


511
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,560
Is Evil Deity...


512
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,870
Come here.


513
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,080
Look at you.


514
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,470
You aren’t yourself anymore.


515
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:18,120
Are you trying to kill yourself


516
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,520
by forcing a breakthrough?


517
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,320
Time is running out.


518
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,470
I have to...


519
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,040
Enough!


520
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,560
No wonder Luo Li didn’t tell you before she left.


521
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:27,950
You miss her so much.


522
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,320
Why don’t you go find her?


523
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,470
What is it


524
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,430
that she kept from me?


525
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:38,840
Back then,


526
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,910
Luo Li only has the bloodline of the Luo God Clan.


527
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,120
She couldn’t carve your name


528
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,430
on the Firmament Rank.


529
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:46,800
So,


530
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,470
only by becoming the Goddess of Tailing


531
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,000
and merging the two bloodlines


532
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,360
could she save you.


533
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,120
But the Goddess


534
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,630
of Tailing


535
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,040
must be loveless.


536
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,520
Loveless?


537
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,430
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?


538
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,150
She’s a fool.


539
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:09,560
Yes.


540
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,760
She’s stupid.


541
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,120
She did that


542
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,430
all because of you.


543
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:14,950
And you?


544
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,190
You seem OK,


545
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,560
but you've been torturing yourself.


546
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,430
You want her sacrifice to be in vain?


547
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,840
She’s forgotten about me.


548
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:24,230
What could I do?


549
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,190
Jog her memory.


550
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,320
Get back


551
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,600
whatever is lost.


552
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,080
Jiuyou.


553
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,040
You're right.


554
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,280
I’m going to see her.


555
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,560
Grand Master,


556
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,470
I’m here to see Luo Li.


557
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,280
Please tell her.


558
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:05,000
Heavenly Sword is in your hand.


559
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,080
I dare not accept your bow.


560
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:10,870
Look,


561
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,520
Luo Li won’t see you.


562
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,000
You should leave.


563
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,630
Please return her to me.


564
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:18,630
Ridiculous!


565
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,430
Luo Li is our Goddess.


566
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:28,040
The past has nothing to do with her.


567
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,150
She won’t be returned to anyone.


568
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,040
I’m here


569
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,430
in hope of


570
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,430
terminating her bond with Tailing


571
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,280
and helping her to regain her memory.


572
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:40,120
She was appointed by heaven to be our Goddess.


573
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,360
The bond cannot be broken off.


574
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,120
I’ll do anything


575
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,390
to compensate for your clan’s loss.


576
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,120
As long as it’s in my power,


577
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:49,430
I’ll do it without hesitation.


578
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,800
If the cost of waking her up...


579
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:56,390
is your life,


580
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,000
will you still do it?
