1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,230
Over the past few months,

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,190
we’ve been through thick and thin together.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,880
Although our clans have a bad relationship,

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,520
it doesn't stop us from being friends.

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,150
Friends?

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,550
You don’t want my blood anymore?

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,390
I do.

9
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:26,630
But,

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,680
I’ll find a way to get it without hurting you.

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,040
What if you can’t find one?

12
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,110
Even if the sacrifice fails,

13
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,270
I won’t get Spirit Blood from you.

14
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,310
You will find a way.

15
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,680
From now on,

16
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,040
we’re friends.

17
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,840
It’s so nice.

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,240
Do you like it?

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,110
Yes.

20
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,110
Come on.

21
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,000
Take the medicine when it’s hot.

22
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,870
I’ll be all right in a few days' rest.

23
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,830
I’ll go get you something to eat.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,310
How is Mu Chen doing?

25
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,360
I haven’t seen him for long.

26
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,720
I’m worried about him.

27
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,720
If I weren’t hurt,

28
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,590
I would have visited him.

29
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,830
Mu Chen is shutting himself in his room
for practice.

30
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,360
Shen told us

31
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,160
not to disturb him.

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,270
Only he can visit Mu Chen every night.

33
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,680
Shutting himself?

34
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,120
Qian’er.

35
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:46,270
You must be tired.

36
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,190
Go to sleep.

37
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,440
OK.

38
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,270
Take good rest.

39
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:53,680
OK.

40
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,510
Qian’er.

41
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,510
What’s wrong?

42
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,440
Senior?

43
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,190
How is your wound?

44
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,550
It’s OK.

45
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,440
Don’t worry.

46
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,360
Sit down.

47
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,110
Mubai.

48
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,270
You killed He Yao,

49
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,520
getting rid of the enemy for North Sect

50
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,670
and taking revenge for Mr. Zhu Tian.

51
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,240
If Mr. Zhu Tian knows in the heaven,

52
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,880
he can die in peace.

53
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,750
Thanks to

54
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,240
the blessing of North Spirits.

55
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,079
Mubai.

56
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,750
How did you know

57
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,720
He Yao built the teleporting formation?

58
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,720
One day before North Sect was guarded,

59
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,829
I saw He Yao sneak into the library

60
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,960
and I followed him up.

61
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,110
I saw he put magic stones in the library

62
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,880
that were used to build the teleporting formation.

63
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,910
Why didn’t you tell us earlier?

64
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,670
He Yao liked to study circles.

65
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,160
I thought he was creating a new one.

66
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,470
Even if I told you,

67
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,360
no one would trust me.

68
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,110
You want to ask

69
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,670
how the sub-stone was sent.

70
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,160
Mubai.

71
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,630
Don’t get me wrong.

72
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,800
He Yao started to build the teleporting formation

73
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,880
before the Sect was guarded.

74
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,670
The sub-stone might have been sent

75
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,750
before the Sect was guarded.

76
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,270
You mean,

77
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,600
the teleporting formation had been built

78
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,600
and He Yao was waiting for the chance.

79
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,030
One night before the battle,

80
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,910
someone looking like He Yao

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,270
lured me into the library.

82
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,030
The teleporting formation was already built.

83
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,829
When I was going to break it,

84
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,160
He Yao brought you and the headmaster in

85
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,079
to frame me up.

86
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,630
Looking like He Yao?

87
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,000
I faintly saw someone.

88
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,190
I wasn’t very sure.

89
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,750
But he couldn’t have lured me away

90
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,320
and meanwhile went to

91
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,910
inform you and the headmaster.

92
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,270
So, it wasn’t him.

93
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,630
Seems like

94
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,600
there’s another traitor.

95
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,550
All right.

96
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,720
I’m relieved to see you’re all right.

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,670
See you.

98
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,390
Thank you for caring.

99
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:09,900
The Great Ruler

100
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,780
Episode 23

101
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,159
Senior.

102
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,600
In the last battle,

103
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,110
the Protection Circle was badly damaged.

104
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,160
If we want it to resist the Black Dragon,

105
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:06,070
we must repair it again.

106
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,230
You.

107
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,390
Yes, you.

108
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,950
I need someone to help when repairing the circle.

109
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,670
Come and help me with it.

110
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,040
Me?

111
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,390
Are you sure?

112
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,159
You look powerful, too.

113
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,880
Would you like to help me

114
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,390
repair the circle?

115
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,110
It’s our bounden duty

116
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,670
to help with our school.

117
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,550
You two.

118
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,760
Come with me.

119
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,159
Sun’er and I have to take care of school stuff.

120
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,950
Miss Mu Ling and Miss Ye are wounded.

121
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,880
They need to rest.

122
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,230
You’re the best candidates.

123
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,110
Go ahead.

124
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,669
I don’t understand you girls.

125
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,470
You were so angry.

126
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,230
But now you’re happy.

127
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,670
I gave the bracelet to Jiuyou.

128
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,670
Why did you?

129
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,640
She liked it.

130
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,000
So, I gave it to her.

131
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,350
We can’t hurry on the journey

132
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,000
unless Jiuyou is happy.

133
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,000
All right.

134
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,790
I gave it to you anyway.

135
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,550
Whatever you do with it.

136
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,910
What are you murmuring?

137
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
Nothing.

138
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,640
Let’s go.

139
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,840
You’re weird.

140
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,320
You’ve been walking the whole day.

141
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,710
Don’t you take a rest?

142
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,640
Luo Li.

143
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,440
I spent a long time on making this bracelet.

144
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,640
Don’t give it to anyone else again.

145
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,200
Thank you.

146
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,590
I’ll go find something to eat.

147
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,550
Luo Li.

148
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,960
I bring you some apples.

149
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,640
Thanks.

150
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,960
Jiuyou!

151
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,350
Jiuyou?

152
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,200
Jiuyou?

153
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,110
Why is she missing again?

154
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,670
I’m afraid she went to White Horse City before us.

155
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,150
Why would she?

156
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,400
I’ll search her with the blood connection.

157
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,320
Jiuyou.

158
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,550
Where are you?

159
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,110
Jiuyou.

160
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,280
Answer me!

161
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,880
Jiuyou.

162
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,550
Jiuyou!

163
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,200
What have you got?

164
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,760
The connection was cut off.

165
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,840
Could she be in danger?

166
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,520
I don’t think so.

167
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,000
I think she’s doing it

168
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,840
on purpose.

169
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,590
On purpose?

170
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,110
It’s hard to explain.

171
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
Time is running out.

172
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,150
Let’s go find her in White Horse City.

173
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,110
OK.

174
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,350
You must intensify the defense around the school.

175
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:50,840
Got it?

176
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,550
Yes.

177
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,550
Miss.

178
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,350
Qian’er.

179
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,590
Where are you going?

180
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,640
Sending some medicine to Mubai.

181
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,080
Liu Mubai made great contributions.

182
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,760
I wonder how he’s recovering.

183
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,640
All teachers and students are praying for him.

184
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,590
Thank you for caring.

185
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,030
He’s much better.

186
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:10,960
I’m relieved, then.

187
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,670
Take good care of him.

188
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,080
OK.

189
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,840
Go.

190
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,320
Why do you look so bad today?

191
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,470
I’m fine.

192
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,470
Thank you.

193
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,670
You’re welcome.

194
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,550
Come.

195
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,280
Put it down.

196
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,640
I’ll take it later.

197
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,960
Go get a map of North Sect for me

198
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,150
from the bookcase.

199
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,790
Will you?

200
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,960
Map?

201
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,910
You haven’t recovered yet.

202
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,000
Why must you be so tired?

203
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:14,000
North Sect is in crisis.

204
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,960
I should try to help.

205
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,760
Qian’er.

206
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,350
I’m kind of starving.

207
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,710
Could you make me something to eat?

208
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,080
Sure.

209
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,320
I’m going right away.

210
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,080
What’s wrong?

211
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,960
You must take a good rest.

212
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,030
OK.

213
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,320
We had a narrow escape.

214
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,880
We must be more cautious.

215
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,380
Yes. Yes.

216
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,960
Excuse me, did you see

217
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,350
a girl in white?

218
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:06,910
No.

219
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,000
On our way here,

220
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,880
no one has seen Jiuyou.

221
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,590
If she flew to White Horse City,

222
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,350
she might have reached there.

223
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,520
Young man.

224
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,350
You’re going to White Horse City?

225
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,280
White Horse City?

226
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,350
You must get me wrong.

227
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,000
You don’t look like

228
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,960
you’re going there.

229
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,520
What is exactly White Horse City?

230
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,550
You really are too young.

231
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,470
Ten years ago, White Horse City is

232
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,670
the most prosperous place in the neighborhood.

233
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,760
You could buy everything there,
including magic stones, magic circle blueprint,

234
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,590
magic beast, magic plant and magic weapon.

235
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,550
And you could get all intel you want in Beiling.

236
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,520
But that was the story ten years ago.

237
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,350
Since it was locked down,

238
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,470
White Horse City has been open to few people.

239
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,640
Locked down?

240
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,280
Why was it locked down?

241
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,880
No one knows then.

242
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,080
Over these years,

243
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,790
many desperadoes

244
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:06,200
have tried to break into White Horse City.

245
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,880
Some went in.

246
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,840
But no one came out.

247
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,320
Young man.

248
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,960
This isn’t a peaceful place.

249
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,350
Go back home.

250
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,150
Yeah. Go back home.

251
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,110
This isn’t where you should have come.
Go back home.

252
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,420
Kid.

253
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,670
Seems like White Horse City is a dangerous place.

254
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,200
I’m afraid Jiuyou may be in danger.

255
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,520
We can’t wait.

256
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,320
Let’s go.

257
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:33,840
San.

258
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,520
See?

259
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,840
White Horse City is right over ahead.

260
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,670
Ask our men to be more careful.

261
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,840
This time,

262
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,280
we mustn’t make a futile trip.

263
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,590
Boss.

264
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,710
I hear people go to White Horse City

265
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,350
but never come out.

266
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,440
Are we really risking our lives?

267
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,710
The brave will succeed.

268
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,470
And the cowardly will fail.

269
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,590
Once we get into town,

270
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,520
we’ll make a fortune!

271
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,910
What’s more,

272
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,790
our acrobatic troupe

273
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,109
will be an overnight success!

274
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,560
Yeah.

275
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:11,920
Ask our men to have a good rest.

276
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:13,760
We’ll get in town later.

277
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,069
Yes.

278
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,310
Dudes!

279
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,310
Cheer up!

280
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,710
OK!

281
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:23,880
Get in town

282
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,680
and make a fortune?

283
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,880
Seems like they’re going to White Horse City.

284
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,110
I think I’ll just

285
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,110
follow them.

286
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,680
Who are you?

287
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,710
San.

288
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,590
Is… Is he…

289
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,000
our new

290
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,230
partner?

291
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,520
I haven’t seen him before.

292
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,640
You haven’t, either?

293
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,280
Have you ever seen him?

294
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,230
No.

295
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,560
No?

296
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,000
Boss!

297
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,310
San!

298
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,830
Dudes, go!

299
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,280
Go what!

300
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,470
Hurry and run!

301
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,110
Hurry and run!

302
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,580
[Bai Tong  Young Master of White Horse City]

303
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,350
You.

304
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,160
You’re going to White Horse City, too?

305
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,680
You’d better leave.

306
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,520
Don’t force me to punch you.

307
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,430
Why?

308
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,400
Oh, I know.

309
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,590
You’re afraid
they might stand in your way to fortune

310
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,110
if they go there.

311
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,160
Don’t worry.

312
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,520
I don’t go there to make a fortune.

313
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,310
I won’t be in your way.

314
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,400
Magic circle?

315
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,000
How rude you are!

316
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,070
Let me out!

317
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,760
Come back!

318
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,470
Let me out!

319
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,470
Do you hear me?

320
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,070
Mubai?

321
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,520
What brings you here?

322
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,560
I haven’t met Mu Chen since I was back.

323
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,400
I’m so boring that I come out for a walk

324
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,760
and talk with him.

325
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,000
You come to see him, too?

326
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,110
Mu Chen is shutting himself for practice.

327
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,680
He doesn’t see guests.

328
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,160
Why is there a magic circle?

329
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,950
I set it.

330
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,800
To protect him.

331
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,710
With you around,

332
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,920
Mu Chen must be safe.

333
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,350
I’ll visit him after he comes out.

334
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:55,880
Shen.

335
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,070
You asked to see us?

336
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,190
Oh…

337
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,190
Nothing serious.

338
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,710
I just want to ask

339
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,430
if there’s anything unusual

340
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,000
in our school.

341
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,230
I don’t think so.

342
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,830
What do you think, Qingshan?

343
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,800
I’ve been helping Dragon Roc

344
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,400
intensify the Protection Circle.

345
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,040
I don’t know what happened in school.

346
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:21,880
Senior.

347
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,640
Why do you ask?

348
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,400
The headmaster died.

349
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,190
As his disciple,

350
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,560
I should care more for the school business.

351
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,310
Don’t you think so?

352
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,470
You’re right.

353
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,160
Does Mubai behave abnormally

354
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,590
after he came back?

355
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,430
Abnormally?

356
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,800
Isn’t he recovering?

357
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,880
What do you mean?

358
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,280
Senior.

359
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,000
Are you suspecting Liu Mubai?

360
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,520
Not really.

361
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,190
Just…

362
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,800
something hasn’t been solved yet.

363
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,280
So…

364
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,920
I have some confusion.

365
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,680
What do you mean specifically?

366
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,160
First,

367
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,350
Mr. Zhu Tian had two mortal wounds.

368
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,040
Why?

369
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,430
I still have no idea.

370
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,350
You’re right.

371
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,920
He Yao is dead.

372
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,160
No one knows how Mr. Zhu Tian died.

373
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,000
Second, Mubai was poisoned by He Yao.

374
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,590
But he was nowhere to be found after the battle.

375
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,070
He said

376
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,640
he caught someone from Evilness Clan

377
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,710
and got the antidote.

378
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,950
But Sun’er,

379
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,430
You know He Yao.

380
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,920
No one can

381
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,520
detoxify his poison.

382
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,800
But senior,

383
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,110
you saw

384
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,710
how Mubai fought the enemies.

385
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,520
He killed the traitor He Yao

386
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,230
and broke the teleporting formation
of Dragon Palace.

387
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,310
Such are evidences that prove he’s innocent.

388
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,430
I don’t think Mubai betrays us.

389
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,070
Senior.

390
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,470
Your words make some sense.

391
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,880
But I agree with Qingshan more.

392
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,280
Besides, Liu Mubai doesn’t have a reason

393
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:08,110
to abandon us for the enemies.

394
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,190
Maybe…

395
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,520
I was thinking too much.

396
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,070
But you guys.

397
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,710
You must keep on the alert

398
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:18,760
and don’t slacken off.

399
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,040
Don’t worry.

400
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,280
We want to find out the truth

401
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,640
and justify Mr. Zhu Tian.

402
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
If there’s anything unusual,

403
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,680
we’ll let you know immediately.

404
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,520
OK.

405
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,760
Thank you.

406
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,070
Who?

407
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,710
White Horse City has been locked down.

408
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,710
Please go back.

409
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,830
We come here,

410
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,280
for something urgent.

411
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,470
Everyone comes with the same reason.

412
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,560
I’ve met so many guys like you.

413
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,560
Since you don’t listen,

414
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,310
don’t blame me for being rude.

415
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,880
He’s using a strange magic circle.

416
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,040
Weird!

417
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,950
Let’s go!

418
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:21,350
Seems like White Horse City is really locked down.

419
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,430
If it’s true,

420
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,590
where is Jiuyou?

421
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,880
Don’t forget Jiuyou can fly.

422
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,800
It’s easier for her to get in town.

423
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,070
We must find her.

424
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,040
But it’s hard to deal with that guy.

425
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,160
Dudes.

426
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,110
Is everyone here?

427
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,830
Yes.

428
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,880
Are you ready?

429
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,310
Yes.

430
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,400
You know what?

431
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,950
Try harder,

432
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,190
I think we’ll soon…

433
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:41,950
Luo Li. Hurry up!

434
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,400
Wait me over there.

435
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,760
Hurry. Go.

436
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,680
Who… Who are you?

437
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,350
Keep your voice down.

438
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,400
Don’t attract his attention.

439
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,110
He?

440
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,590
The man wearing a mask?

441
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:59,110
You met Bai Tong?

442
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,160
Bai Tong?

443
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:01,800
Tell me.

444
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,950
Do you want to get in town, too?

445
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,430
No.

446
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,920
We’re just passing by.

447
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,680
But we hear the town is locked down.

448
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,000
We wonder why.

449
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,430
It’s been locked down for ten years.

450
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,830
You know that?

451
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,880
White Horse City is

452
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,710
a great place with cheers and laughter.

453
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,160
There are endless delicacies,

454
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,640
bottomless good wine

455
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,560
and countless beautiful girls.

456
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,560
For people like us,

457
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,710
that is a paradise

458
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,830
without worries,

459
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,400
pains or annoyances.

460
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:33,560
Unfortunately,

461
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,430
we can hardly get in there now.

462
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,350
Then how will you get in?

463
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,920
Through the tunnel.

464
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,560
We keep digging

465
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,830
every day.

466
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,350
One day, we will dig through

467
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:46,280
a happy tunnel to White Horse City.

468
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,560
Well.

469
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,880
Would you like to join us?

470
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,310
Many hands provide great strength.

471
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,560
How long will it take

472
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,760
to finish the tunnel?

473
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:56,000
Don’t you know perseverance?

474
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,350
You know what?

475
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,070
We dug the tunnel

476
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,640
in the east of town.

477
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,880
If it weren’t blocked by a rock,

478
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,190
it would have got through the town.

479
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:08,310
We could hear the noise in town beyond the rock.

480
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,920
Unfortunately,

481
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,710
we have to dig a new one.

482
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,310
Hurry if you want to join us.

483
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:19,350
Or don’t stand in my way.

484
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,520
Who are you?

485
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,280
Where am I?

486
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,880
Want to trap me with such a little circle?

487
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,880
Let me out!

488
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,310
Let me out!

489
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,520
Don’t waste your time. I won’t.

490
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,190
Oh, you can talk?

491
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,560
I thought you were mute.

492
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,950
I don’t want it!

493
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,280
I’m starving.

494
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,470
Where are you going?

495
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,800
I’m not full yet.

496
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,310
What?

497
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,110
I’m not full yet.

498
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,680
Do you know how much you just ate?

499
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,400
I’m not full yet. So what?

500
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,400
Let me out.

501
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,230
Or

502
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,160
stay here and cook for me.

503
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,000
Where are you going?

504
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,920
I’ll eat more than you think.

505
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,400
Why isn’t he here?

506
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,830
Here we are.

507
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,800
Can you do it?

508
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,830
We’ll see.

509
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,560
You know what?

510
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,800
Keep fighting!

511
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,230
White Horse City is right ahead.

512
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,310
I’m telling you.

513
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,590
Just hang in there.

514
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,560
After we dig through the tunnel…

515
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,520
Uh…

516
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,950
Why do we fail again?

517
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,640
Not these.

518
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,920
It’s another harvest year.

519
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,070
Thank God for blessing us.

520
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,350
All letters are from the same place.

521
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:06,110
Dragon Slave Village I asked Liu Mubai to check.

522
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,350
Who’s there?

523
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,230
Kid.

524
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,430
What’s wrong with you?

525
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,880
I won’t hurt you.

526
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,830
Can you tell me

527
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,310
what happened here?

528
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,400
Kid!

529
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,230
Kid!

530
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,830
I won’t hurt you.

531
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,230
I won’t hurt you.

532
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,310
Kid!

533
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,230
Power of Whisper?

534
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,280
Kid!

535
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,190
Kid!

536
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,560
Kid.

537
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,520
You’re awake?

538
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,760
Kid.

539
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,040
Don’t worry.

540
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,560
I mean no harm to you.

541
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,560
Could you tell me

542
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,000
what happened here?

543
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,520
My father died.

544
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,880
All the other villagers died, too.

545
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:04,710
We must have enraged God.

546
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,909
So, the Master was sent to punish us.

547
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,800
God?

548
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,320
The Evil Deity again.

549
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,469
You just mentioned the Master.

550
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,280
What does he look like?

551
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,840
He killed all the other villagers

552
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,360
with a fan.

553
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:33,670
God must be punishing us.

554
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,190
He’s punishing us!

555
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:38,080
Fan?

556
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,280
Could he be?

557
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:46,120
God must be punishing us.

558
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,560
He’s punishing us…

559
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:53,630
Kid.

560
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,670
Kid!

561
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,230
Kid!

562
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,670
Kid.

563
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,040
Kid.

564
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,120
Evil Deity.

565
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,230
You killed innocent people.

566
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,760
I swear,

567
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,000
I will take revenge

568
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,870
on you!

569
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,300
Come and have a look.

570
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,470
So, White Horse City is machine-operated town.

571
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,560
Let’s find someone

572
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:03,040
and ask about the White Dragon and Jiuyou.

573
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:03,760
OK.

574
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,560
Sir.

575
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,710
Excuse me…

576
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,910
Young man.

577
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,520
Why are you wearing a sad face?

578
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,360
In our city,

579
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,670
you should be happy!

580
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:19,190
The tea is my treat!

581
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,600
No, thanks.

582
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:25,280
Go.

583
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:28,800
Luo Li.

584
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:32,040
Don’t you think people in the city are weird?

585
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:36,950
Seems like no one worries.

586
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:37,870
It’s too weird.

587
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,430
More than that.

588
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,150
It’s kind of wicked.

589
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,840
Everyone in city

590
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,800
is wearing a sick smile.

591
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,670
And there are no old men or children.

592
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,080
Only young people.

593
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,000
Let’s check over there.

594
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,120
Luo Li.

595
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,760
I suddenly feel so happy!

596
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,120
I don’t know why.

597
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,150
It’s certainly because you’re by my side.

598
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,520
Me, too.

599
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,710
I have never been so happy before.

600
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,560
Possibly because you’re staying with me.

601
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,190
I’ll always be happy!

602
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,710
What happened?

603
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,760
My mind

604
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,230
was full of pictures of our childhood.

605
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,190
So was mine.

606
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,670
But how come?

607
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,390
Something here must be affecting us.

608
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,670
This city is too weird!

609
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:19,950
Luo Li.

610
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:21,800
Someone is spying on us.

611
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,800
Here he comes.

612
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,710
Who are you?

613
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,710
Why are you stalking us?

614
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,060
[Bai Xuan  Lord of White Horse City]

615
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,670
I’m the lord of White Horse City.

616
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,710
Bai Xuan.

617
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,120
Lord?

618
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,080
Exactly.

619
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,040
It’s my question time.

620
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:51,950
Who are you?

621
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,320
How did you get in?

622
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,430
You don’t need to answer now.

623
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,870
Why don’t you come to my home and explain?

624
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:02,910
Please come.

625
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:05,710
Luo Li.

626
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,320
Wait for me here.

627
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,710
If anything happens,

628
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,040
you can help.

629
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,150
This way, please.

630
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,120
Please sit down.

631
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,080
I think you know that our town is locked down

632
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,840
from others.

633
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,870
I didn’t break in deliberately.

634
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,430
A friend of mine

635
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,910
went missing around your city.

636
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,040
We had no choice, but to get in and look for her.

637
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,800
Please forgive us.

638
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,710
Our town has been locked down for ten years.

639
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,840
How would your friend be here?

640
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,670
We certainly know your rules.

641
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,320
But we won’t leave

642
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,950
before we find her.

643
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,520
Unless…

644
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,760
Unless…

645
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:31,080
I help you to find her?

646
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,840
Exactly.

647
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,000
If you help us to look for her,

648
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,150
we’ll make it sooner.

649
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,080
If we really fail to find her,

650
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,520
we’ll leave immediately.

651
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:44,080
What’s your friend’s name?

652
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,670
What does she look like?

653
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,520
She’s called Jiuyou.

654
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,600
She’s a young girl.

655
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,470
She’s in white

656
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,910
and looks beautiful.

657
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,430
But she’s irascible.

658
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:08,470
Do you hear him?

659
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,910
Go and look for Miss Jiuyou.

660
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,430
Yes.

661
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,360
Don’t panic.
