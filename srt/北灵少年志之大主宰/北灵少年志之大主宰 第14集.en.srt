1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,550
The North Sect

3
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,710
isn’t any other place.

4
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,950
Be extra careful.

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,470
Take care of your eyes.

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,520
Mr. Mu.

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,200
Rest assured.

8
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,040
I’m Mu Chen’s eyes.

9
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,040
And me.

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,880
Father.

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,590
I wonder how Mubai is now.

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,270
Now that he’s also going to the North Sect,

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,590
let’s go together.

14
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,080
Last time,

15
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,150
he didn’t look well.

16
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:49,110
Chen.

17
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,590
Mubai lost his father and the territory.

18
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,000
As his friend, you should care for him.

19
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,790
OK.

20
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,150
I will, father.

21
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:58,910
Ms. Luo Li.

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,190
When I studied in North Sect,

23
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,910
I heard some senior students went to Lei Territory

24
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,550
but no one came back alive.

25
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,039
You must be careful.

26
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,480
Rest assured, Mr. Mu.

27
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,400
I know what to do.

28
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,000
Alright.

29
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,039
I’ll stop nagging.

30
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,440
Please take care of my son.

31
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:10,620
The Great Ruler

32
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,580
Episode 14

33
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,079
Mu Chen.

34
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,240
You haven’t recovered.

35
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,520
You shouldn’t have used

36
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,470
the teleportation.

37
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,880
No sound at all.

38
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,880
Is it a street in Liu Territory?

39
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,000
Mu Chen.

40
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,440
We are in the right place.

41
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,720
It’s just that

42
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,190
there’s no one here.

43
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,470
Let’s go

44
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,160
to see Mubai.

45
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,470
Mubai.

46
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,320
The Liu Mansion is empty.

47
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,440
Let’s go back.

48
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,270
Mu Chen.

49
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,520
Are you alright?

50
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,390
I’m fine.

51
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,480
Let’s have a look over there.

52
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,510
The house is tidy.

53
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,600
Someone seemed to have lived here.

54
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,670
I guess Mubai was back.

55
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,480
Qian’er might be with him.

56
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,200
How do you know that?

57
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,720
The house

58
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,440
must’ve been cleaned by a girl.

59
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,880
Quilts and dinnerware were put away.

60
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:43,640
Perhaps they won’t come back in a short time.

61
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,350
Now that Mubai isn’t here,

62
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,830
shall we leave?

63
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,600
OK.

64
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,600
Mu Chen.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,830
How do you feel?

66
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,720
Are you alright?

67
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,830
Night has fallen.

68
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,110
Mu Chen consumed too much energy when teleporting.

69
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,200
Let’s rest here tonight

70
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,350
and set off tomorrow.

71
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,920
Fine.

72
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,270
It’s Mubai’s house after all.

73
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,230
How about

74
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,200
we sleep on the floor tonight?

75
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:32,920
Qingshan.

76
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,159
Do we have food?

77
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,510
Yes, some cakes.

78
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,040
These again?

79
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,550
Only these cakes.

80
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,880
Just have some.

81
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,480
No.

82
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,270
You are weak,

83
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,760
and you need nutrition.

84
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,670
You can’t always eat these.

85
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,320
We only bring these.

86
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,000
It can do.

87
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,320
Where are you going?

88
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,670
Wait here.

89
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,110
Xuantong.

90
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,230
As I know,

91
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,760
Xue Lingzi has left Xue God Clan

92
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,320
for Five Sects with some men.

93
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,320
Go to Five Sects right now

94
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,950
and protect Luo Li.

95
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,670
Qingshan.

96
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,040
Do you smell

97
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,390
something burnt?

98
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,440
Really?

99
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,830
You are right.

100
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,640
Something is burnt.

101
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,000
Luo Li.

102
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,270
You made this?

103
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,920
I heard that

104
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,830
barbecue made this way is good.

105
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,600
It’s my first time doing this.

106
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,350
Barbecue?

107
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:51,950
Give me some.

108
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,040
Let me try it.

109
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,790
Does it

110
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,880
taste good?

111
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,110
Yes.

112
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,040
It’s tasty.

113
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:07,880
Are you sure?

114
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,880
Absolutely.

115
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,070
It’s the best barbecue I’ve ever had.

116
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,720
Qingshan.

117
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,390
Try it.

118
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:22,760
Well,

119
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:23,830
I’m not hungry.

120
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,550
Enjoy it.

121
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,470
Stop eating.

122
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:36,840
What’s wrong?

123
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,760
The barbecue is good.

124
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:39,710
I haven’t had

125
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,000
such good barbecue for a long time.

126
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,030
Crap!

127
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,230
Is something on fire?

128
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,110
It’s the smell of burnt food.

129
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,520
What’s Luo Li doing

130
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,910
in the middle of the night?

131
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,880
Qingshan.

132
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,080
Take me over there.

133
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,150
Slowly.

134
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,710
Turn right.

135
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,000
Your face is dirty.

136
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,110
Sorry.

137
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,760
I disturbed you.

138
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,790
Qingshan.

139
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,440
Go back and sleep.

140
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,440
I’m not sleepy.

141
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,440
It’s smelly. How can I fall asleep?

142
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,640
I’m sleepy now.

143
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,200
Take your time.

144
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,840
I’m going back.

145
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,590
Luo Li.

146
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,710
Are you learning to barbecue?

147
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,790
You like it, don’t you?

148
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,400
So you make it for me

149
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,080
all the night?

150
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,440
Your eyes are injured

151
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,470
and in bad shape.

152
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,110
I’m

153
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,790
trying to make some nutrient food to you.

154
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,200
Give me meat.

155
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
And your hand.

156
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,960
You need to

157
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,640
keep turning the meat

158
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,470
to make it tasty.

159
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,080
You are knowledgeable.

160
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,670
My father taught me this.

161
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,550
He said roasting meat is like being a man.

162
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,200
If we only roast one side,

163
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,110
that side will be overcooked

164
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,350
while the other side

165
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,110
is still raw.

166
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,550
Is it good?

167
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,670
Give me some.

168
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,550
Didn’t you go to sleep?

169
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,960
Your barbecue is tempting.

170
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,150
I can’t fall asleep.

171
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:11,760
Luo Li.

172
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,080
I want this.

173
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,200
It’s good.

174
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,640
Mu Chen.

175
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,840
You woke me up.

176
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,400
Don’t you give me some goodies?

177
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,440
I want to.

178
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,840
But I can’t bring food

179

I will.

When we get in the North Sect,

185

Do we have to practice in the mountains?

How did you get so many power points?

315
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,470
Another way to get power points

316
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,950
is to pawn things.

317
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,640
I pawned all my treasures brought from home

for power points.

319
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,640
I rented this deluxe suite long ago

all his power points

325
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,710
for formation books and magic scrolls.

326
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,830
He’s only able to afford the cheapest dorm.

327
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,710
I wanted him to move here

to live with us.

329
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,310
He was reluctant.

00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,230
Where is he now?

331
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,830
I want to see him.

332
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,760
You’d better not.

333
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,640
He doesn’t want to see you at all.

334
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,160
I have to.

335
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,000
I need to have a word with him.

336
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,400
Go ahead.

337
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,350

Rest assured.

344
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,920
I’ll talk to him.

345
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,470
What brings you here?

346
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,640
Qian’er gave you this.

347

You love Qian’er.

348
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,640
Why do you treat her like that?

349
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,430
None of your business.

350
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,680
We are friends.

351

You have no kin now.

352

I must take care of you.

353

Kin.

00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,560
Right.

355
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,310
I have no kin now.

356
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,000
I’m sorry for your loss.

357
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,110
If you want to take revenge,

358
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,920
do it now.

359
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,190
Revenge?

360
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,760
We did the wrong thing and paid the price.

361
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,470
Why should I take revenge?

362
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,760
What on earth do you want?

363
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,280
I want to rejuvenate Liu Territory.

364
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,310
I can help you.

365
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,880
You shouldn’t

366
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,230
desperately spar with others.

367
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,400
Your body can’t bear it.

368
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,640
Help me?

369
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,350
Do you pity me?

370
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,430
You should.

371
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,070
You are the respectable hero

372
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,430
of the Mu-Liu war.

373
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,230
You pity me, the loser of the war.

374
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,590
This is the North Sect.

375
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,710
With your talent, you can make great progress.

376
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,350
It’s more than one way to rejuvenate Liu Territory.

377
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,230
Enough!

378
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,710
I said I don’t need your help.

379
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,590
I don’t want to see you again.

380
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,070
Leave.

381
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,680
Liu Mubai.

382
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,640
We’ve been friends since little.

383
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,520
We’ve been through thick and thin together.

384
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,430
How could I

385
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,710
turn a blind eye to your business?

386
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,110
And,

387
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,110
don’t treat Qian’er like that.

388
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,800
Her pain is no less than yours.

389
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,800
In my heart,

390
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,560
you are my friend forever.

391
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,040
Mubai.

392
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,000
Your father was bewitched by evilness.

393
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,160
Do not act rashly.

394
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,070
Father.

395
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,310
Ms. Ye.

396
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,520
Morning, Ms. Ye.

397
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,000
Morning, Qingshan.

398
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,560
Guess you must be waiting for me,

399
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,800
so I came early.

400
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,710
This is for you.

401
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,190
It is...

402
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,920
You bought me drinks yesterday.

403
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,280
I appreciate it.

404
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,560
This is the local specialty of Mu Territory.

405
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:36,710
It's tasty.

406
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,000
Qingshan.

407
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:39,800
Qingshan.

408
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,950
The specialty from my father...

409
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,070
What are you doing?

410
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,070
Ms. Ye.

411
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,760
What’s our schedule today?

412
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,040
North Sect has five courses:

413
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,040
power, spell, formation,

414
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,590
martial art, and alchemy.

415
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,800
I’ll take you to select courses.

416
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,710
I want to take the spell class.

417
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,950
Considering your admission assessment performance,

418
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,230
the spell class suits you the most.

419
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,520
Does Mubai study spells too?

420
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,310
Yes.

421
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,640
He doesn’t listen to anyone now.

422
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,590
Qian’er.

423
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,040
I can only count on you.

424
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:15,830
Qian’er.

425
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,160
I want to go there too.

426
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,560
OK.

427
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:20,520
What about you two?

428
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,070
I...

429
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,800
I want to take a look at other classes.

430
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,950
I’ll be with Mu Chen.

431
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,590
He can’t go anywhere

432
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,040
without me.

433
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,520
Well.

434
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,230
Qian’er, take Luo Li to spell class.

435
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,590
I’ll take them to other classes.

436
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,400
Let's go.

437
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:49,710
Remember to fill these parts.

438
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,000
She is Ms. Mu Ling,

439
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,400
the deputy headmaster of North Sect.

440
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,160
Hello, Ms. Mu.

441
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,880
There are many kinds of spells.

442
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,280
Basically, they are divided

443
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,280
into offensive spells and defensive spells.

444
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,420
[Mu Ling, Deputy Headmaster of North Sect, Teacher of Spell]

445
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,590
I’ll give you a demonstration

446
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,950
of defensive spells.

447
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,560
Who wants to work with me?

448
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:15,680
It’s wonderful.

449
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,430
Yes.

450
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,430
Amazing.

451
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:24,800
Ms. Ye.

452
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,400
What do they study?

453
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,040
They study martial art.

454
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,520
Martial art?

455
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,000
Sounds like my thing.

456
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,430
I’ll go to have a look.

457
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,830
Mu Chen. Will you go with me?

458
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,310
Do you think I can take martial art classes?

459
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,880
Well, wait for me here.

460
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,520
I’ll go have a look.

461
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,760
You’d better not.

462
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,230
The teacher of martial art is Qingling.

463
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,680
She is not easygoing.

464
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,110
Also,

465
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,950
you have seen their strong physiques.

466
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,950
Don’t worry.

467
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,310
Martial art is my strength.

468
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,560
Goodbye.

469
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,070
I’ll be right back.

470
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:02,800
Ms. Ye.

471
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,800
No need to worry.

472
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,520
Qingshan was admitted by North Sect

473
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,190
for his outstanding martial arts.

474
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,470
You don’t know.

475
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,830
He just came to the school.

476
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,830
And he is impetuous.

477
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,190
He knows little about the school.

478
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,160
I’m afraid he...

479
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,230
Well,

480
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,230
he has left.

481
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,520
Will you wait for him here?

482
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,070
Ms. Ye.

483
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:22,830
I want to take formation classes.

484
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,280
Can you show me the way?

485
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,430
What a coincidence.

486
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,560
I teach that class.

487
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,590
Let’s go.

488
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,680
Let me introduce him.

489
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,830
He is a freshman,

490
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,920
Mu Chen.

491
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,430
Mu Chen.

492
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,520
Did you learn heart formations in Beiling School?

493
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,280
Yes.

494
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,760
My father taught me.

495
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,040
Please show us

496
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,350
the out-cast formation.

497
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,230
OK.

498
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,350
You are proud of

499
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,680
your little out-cast formation, huh?

500
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,190
Mr. He Yao.

501
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,230
What brings you here?

502
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:14,060
[He Yao, Teacher of Formation in North Sect]

503
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,560
Formations are diversified

504
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,680
and flexible.

505
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,040
A top formation master

506
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,800
should use formations in different ways.

507
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,680
What happened?

508
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,590
This is Mr. He Yao.

509
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,280
His formations are changeable,

510
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,430
which can be lines or points.

511
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,110
So, the might differs.

512
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,280
Awesome.

513
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,310
Can formations work like that?

514
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,280
That’s new to me.

515
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,560
Sorry, Sun’er.

516
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,640
I just passed by.

517
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,470
Sorry to interrupt you.

518
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,950
Wait, Mr. He!

519
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,160
Ms. Ye.

520
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,830
What's his name?

521
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,000
He’s He Yao,

522
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,560
also a teacher in North Sect.

523
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,070
He is eccentric,

524
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,830
and always studies odd formations.

525
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,430
You hear that?

526
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,760
The martial art class is beginning.

527
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,680
The freshmen will suffer.

528
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,000
Practice on your own.

529
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,280
Yes.

530
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,190
Mu Chen.

531
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,000
What’s wrong?

532
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,190
Where is Qingshan?

533
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,920
Qingshan went to take martial art class.

534
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:31,830
Luo Li.

535
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,350
How was your spell class going?

536
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,310
Was it fun?

537
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,350
Yes, it’s good.

538
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,110
Ms. Mu Ling

539
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,070
taught me a new method to use spells.

540
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:40,560
I learned a lot.

541
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,880
Luo God created Luo God Sword and Luo God Spell.

542
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,400
They are complementary.

543
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,830
Only you integrate Luo God Sword and Luo God Spell

544
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,760
with your body,

545
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:54,110
can the power of the three be fully released.

546
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:00,830
Well done.

547
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,430
Where’s Qian’er?

548
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,830
Didn’t she come with you?

549
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,680
How is

550
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,710
How is he?

551
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,280
Mubai is still silent.

552
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,680
Qian’er is with him now.

553
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:15,640
Only Qian’er can make him come around.

554
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,640
Luo Li.

555
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,590
That teacher was impressive.

556
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,110
I want to chat with him.

557
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,830
I’ve never seen his formations before.

558
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,470
I’d like to ask him for advice.

559
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,040
Hello, everyone.

560
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,400
I’m Tan Qingshan,

561
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,830
a freshman.

562
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,230
Nice to meet you.

563
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,560
Sissy.

564
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,830
You shouldn’t come here.

565
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,950
Leave.

566
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,640
Freshman.

567
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,710
You can’t leave since you’re here already.

568
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,400
What are you doing?

569
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,880
-I’m capable!
-What are you doing?

570
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,430
Sit back!

571
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,400
Back to your seats!

572
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,760
Lucky you.

573
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,460
[Ye Qingling, Teacher of Martial Art in North Sect]

574
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,800
Are you Tan Qingshan?

575
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,160
Last night,

576
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,190
my sister Ye Sun’er mentioned you.

577
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,000
I’m Ye Qingling,

578
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,230
the teacher of martial art class.

579
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:21,950
Hello, Ms. Ye.

580
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,190
Nice to meet you.

581
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,160
With your physique,

582
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,280
you still dare to take my class.

583
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,680
You are brave.

584
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,400
Fine.

585
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,160
It’s for my sister’s sake.

586
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,560
Did you bring a gift?

587
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,070
No.

588
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,400
No?

589
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,590
Now that you don’t,

590
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,190
we’ll give you one.

591
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,000
Guys.

592
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,680
-Yes!
-Yes!

593
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,560
Take care of our freshman.

594
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,000
What are you doing?

595
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,070
Don’t!

596
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,160
Qingling!

597
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:57,710
Qingling!

598
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:58,920
What are you doing?

599
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,110
Let him go.

600
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,520
Sun’er. Help me.

601
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,590
Qingling.

602
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,590
Treating Qingshan like this.

603
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,160
is against the rule.

604
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:06,920
Right.

605
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,920
You always follow rules.

606
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,560
However,

607
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,640
our class also has rules.

608
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,070
Freshmen must have a spar before taking classes.

609
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,400
We have another freshman today.

610
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,950
Let Tan Qingshan spar with him.

611
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,350
It doesn’t break the rule, does it?

612
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,560
Li Xuantong.

613
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,400
Yes.

614
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:30,430
Come

615
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,560
and spar with your contemporary.

616
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,040
He has gone.

617
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,070
That old man is not only eccentric,

618
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,040
but also has erratic behavior.

619
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,160
Are you looking for me?

620
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,000
Old...

621
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,880
Mr. He Yao.

622
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,560
I’ve never seen that kind of

623
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,160
formations before.

624
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,880
Can you give me some advice?

625
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,160
Shoot.

626
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,760
Is there any problem

627
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,640
with my out-cast formations?

628
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,430
Yes, of course.

629
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,400
Though your out-cast formations

630
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,400
are destructive,

631
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,400
the form is too simple.

632
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,950
Formations shall be

633
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:29,000
altered according to situations

634
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,400
in the battle.

635
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,400
You have a point.

636
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:35,430
Formations are similar basically,

637
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,430
while the effect varies

638
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,830
with the ways to cast.

639
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,230
Evilness Clan fears the Five Sects

640
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,230
because they have powerful defensive formations.

641
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,760
That should be

642
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,800
the most advanced formation.

643
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,520
This girl is right.

644
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,430
Large formations consume tons of energy,

645
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,310
and can’t be done alone,

646
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,000
while the might is extraordinary.

647
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,000
Mu Chen.

648
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,110
The formation you built

649
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:13,590
at the Mu-Liu Battle was an example.

650
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,310
Over the past years,

651
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,920
I've toured around the world

652
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,310
and collected many formation diagrams.

653
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,760
Mr. Mu.

654
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,640
Can you show me?

655
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,470
If you’re interested,

656
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,000
you can come to me.

657
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,640
Mr. Mu.

658
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,040
How about today?

659
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,070
Mu Chen.

660
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,710
Bravo!

661
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:24,949
Are you alright?

662
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,560
You are a respectable opponent.

663
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:30,360
So are you.

664
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:31,560
From now on,

665
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,800
you two are my students.

666
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,320
Remember to take classes punctually every day.

667
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,120
Headmasters,

668
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,389
greetings.

669
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,840
Hello, Mr. Mu.

670
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,190
Where is Ling Xi?

671
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:56,429
Headmasters. Mr. Mu and Mr. Mo.

672
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,080
My headmaster is secluding for cultivation.

673
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,390
I was assigned to discuss business with you.

674
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,630
So, you are

675
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,560
Mu Ling, the Deputy Headmaster of North Sect.

676
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:05,910
I’ve heard so much about you.

677
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,870
I should’ve gone to Five Sects myself

678
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:11,950
to visit you.

679
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,470
But this issue is urgent.

680
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,470
Sorry to let you

681
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,360
come here in person.

682
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,280
It’s OK, Mr. Mu.

683
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,840
It’s been 5,000 years.

684
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,390
The Evil Deity is coming back.

685
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,800
I invite you here

686
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,910
to discuss how to fight against him.

687
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,430
Nine Eyes haven’t appeared,

688
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,520
so Evil Deity can’t come back yet.

689
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,710
Black Dragon surrendered to Evil Deity.

690
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:38,800
The priority is to beware of Black Dragon.

691
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,390
Though we can

692
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,600
join hands and have a fight with Black Dragon,

693
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,000
both sides

694
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,040
will suffer a huge loss.

695
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:49,470
The one who sealed Evil Deity back then

696
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,950
was the Goddess of Futu Ancient Clan,

697
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,000
Qing Yanjing.

698
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:56,230
If we can gain Three God Clans’ assistance,

699
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,840
Evil Deity and Black Dragon can definitely

700
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,470
be eliminated.

701
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,910
Tailing Clan guards Firmament Rank for generations.

702
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,600
There’s no news of Futu Ancient Clan for years.

703
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,150
Though we know

704
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,520
where Luo God Clan is,

705
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,600
it’s been at war with Xue God Clan for years.

706
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,950
They can’t even take care of themselves.

707
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,360
Seems that we have to rescue Luo God Clan first

708
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,120
and then join hands to fight against Evil Deity.

709
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,870
In the whole world,

710
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,320
only Lord White Dragon

711
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,000
is Black Dragon’s match.

712
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:30,870
But White Dragon is missing.

713
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,230
How should we look for him?

714
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,840
Ling Xi had contact with White Dragon.

715
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,520
How about we look for White Dragon

716
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,000
after Ling Xi finishes the cultivation?

717
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,150
OK.

718
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:44,910
Mu.

719
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,040
Do you really

720
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,560
not know Futu Ancient Clan’s whereabouts?

721
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:50,630
No.

722
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,950
I only wish Mu Chen could

723
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,150
grow up and get stronger.

724
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,520
Goddess.

725
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,950
Xuantong.

726
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,840
Goddess.

727
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,320
I’ve finally found you.

728
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:14,630
What brings you here?

729
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,040
Leader ordered me to protect you.

730
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,870
Goddess.

731
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,190
Who is he?

732
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,280
I’m Mu Chen,

733
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:24,430
Luo Li’s friend.

734
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,190
Thanks for protecting her.

735
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,470
That’s my leader’s order.

736
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,840
It has nothing to do with you.

737
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:30,600
Xuantong.

738
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,000
Why are you here?

739
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:35,800
You!

740
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:38,080
Qingshan. Do you know him?

741
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,360
No.

742
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:42,120
We met in the martial art class today.

743
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,630
By the way,

744
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,520
was the class fun?

745
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,520
Yes, it was.

746
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,360
Li Xuantong, am I right?

747
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,800
It’s late.

748
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,870
Let’s go back.

749
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,560
Qingshan.

750
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,430
Xuantong.

751
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,630
Come with me.

752
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,520
Let’s go.

753
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:24,040
How did you come here?

754
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,190
Leader wrote a recommendation letter for me.

755
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,560
I’m also a student in North Sect now.

756
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,560
How was it going

757
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,840
about the Dead Crone?

758
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,190
I have no idea.

759
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:37,430
What about the Clan?

760
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,630
Xue God Clan is still pressing ahead.

761
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,710
Leader knew

762
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,520
Xue Lingzi took men to the Five Sects.

763
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,430
He was worried about you,

764
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,870
so he assigned me to protect you.

765
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,230
The North Sect has many skilled masters,

766
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,520
as well as defensive formations.

767
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,840
How do they dare to come?

768
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,950
You are

769
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,000
in the human clan’s territory.

770
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,760
You’d better be careful.

771
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,120
Speaking of that,

772
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,630
something comes to my mind.

773
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,800
From now on,

774
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,190
don’t call me Goddess.

775
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:12,800
Just call me Luo Li.

776
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,760
I’ve left the clan.

777
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:16,430
I don’t want people here

778
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,760
treat me differently again.

779
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,190
But

780
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,470
I’ve called you Goddess for 20 years.

781
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,710
I don’t think I can change it instantly.

782
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,230
Xuantong.

783
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,360
I know

784
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,190
you see yourself as my guard.

785
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,360
But you know,

786
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,390
you are like a brother to me.

787
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,430
You

788
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,390
don’t have to be so polite to me.

789
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,000
I’m used to it.

790
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,520
Don’t be too respectful to me at least.

791
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,950
We are in a school now.

792
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,520
Just take me as your schoolmate.

793
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:50,840
OK.

794
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,360
It’s crowded here in the daytime.

795
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,390
I practice spells here at night.

796
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,670
You may come here if you need me.

797
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:13,560
OK.

798
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,390
It’s late.

799
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,360
Let’s go back.

800
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:25,000
You’ve selected your courses.

801
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:29,080
The books and scrolls for the future cultivation

802
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,430
are required to be bought here

803
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,000
with power points.

804
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:42,670
Ms. Ye.

805
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,630
This trial base

806
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,560
is the hunting ground of North Sect?

807
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,470
Yes.

808
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,320
Hunting preys

809
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,430
in the trial base

810
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,870
can improve your cultivation,

811
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,800
gain power points and proper rewards.

812
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,910
But the difficulty of the trial bases varies.

813
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,520
You’ll need power points

814
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,560
in exchange for an entrance pass.

815
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:05,230
The higher the trial base level is,

816
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,630
the more power points it costs.

817
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:12,190
This is the Lei Territory?
