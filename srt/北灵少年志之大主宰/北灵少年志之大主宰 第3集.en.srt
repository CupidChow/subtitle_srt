[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,040
Liu Mubai,

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,400
someone has booked this place.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,000
You should find another place to practice.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:18,960
Luo Li!

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:19,880
Come here!

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,240
I came early today

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,960
to find you a good place.

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,200
Let’s go now.

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:29,760
OK.

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,320
Qian’er,

12
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,640
are you here to practice as well?

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:34,840
You can sit my seat.

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,600
No, no.

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,680
My seat is for you.

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,440
Is that alright?

17
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,480
Sure it is!

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,960
This is the place to practice you said yesterday?

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,760
This is the place they practice.

20
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,400
I don’t have power.

21
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,520
So,

22
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,600
I can only watch them.

23
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,760
Of course it’s alright.

24
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,960
I’m willing to do that.

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:53,800
Me, too.

26
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,800
If I sit here,

27
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,920
what about you?

28
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,000
I’ve been here so long.

29
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,160
I should go have meal.

30
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:58,920
Yes,

31
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,640
I’m hungry as well.

32
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,360
I’m going to eat as well.

33
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,200
Thank you.

34
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,440
Nothing at all.

35
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:04,840
Liu Mubai,

36
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,510
there is a seat.

37
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,080
Luo Li,

38
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,720
thank you for saving me.

39
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:15,720
But,

40
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,720
I made you lose your Jiezi Coin.

41
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,960
Don’t worry!

42
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,480
I’ll find it back for you!

43
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,680
I told you.

44
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,080
It can’t be found anymore.

45
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,560
Well...

46
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,840
I asked you to be my teacher.

47
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,800
Have you decided?

48
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,240
I’m not interested.

49
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,080
How does it feel to practice
in the Power-gathering Circle?

50
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,280
The speed

51
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,560
of collecting power practicing here

52
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,720
is three times faster than it of outside.

53
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,120
You don’t have power.

54
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,280
How do you know this?

55
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,960
Although I have no power now,

56
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,479
I believe that I will get power

57
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,479
one day.

58
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,240
So I learned about it in case of that.

59
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,520
Have a try.

60
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,840
It seems that it’s not a coincidence that she killed

61
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,760
Python Tunshan herself.

62
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,680
Liu Yang!

63
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:24,920
What are you doing?

64
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,000
Loser,

65
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,360
Power-gathering Circle is for ones
who want to practice their power,

66
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,800
not for the ones like you who

67
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,600
can only watch others practicing.

68
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,160
Why are you so unreasonable?

69
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,520
Calm down.

70
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,400
Cut the crap.

71
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,400
Get your seat from me,

72
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,000
or get lost now!

73
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,640
Your cousin is so brutal.

74
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,019
The Great Ruler

75
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,220
Episode 3

76
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,760
No!

77
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,159
She will be possessed by devil!

78
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,040
Go call Mr. Mo!

79
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,260
[Young Luo Li]

80
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,240
I’ll protect you.

81
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,920
Isn’t this the sign of the goddess of Luo God Clan?

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,080
What happened?

83
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,040
This is really surprising.

84
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,840
Follow me.

85
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,760
What’s going on?

86
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,000
I didn’t expect

87
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,720
to make her lose her thing.

88
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,320
Captain,

89
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,640
the undulation of power today

90
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,920
must from that goddess.

91
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,760
When will we start?

92
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,480
What are you rushing for?

93
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,480
Speak!

94
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,080
They were exposed.

95
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,320
Mr. Mo will transfer the goddess to other places.

96
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,080
Then,

97
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,960
we should wait for them.

98
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,920
Ruler Liu,

99
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,040
it’s been ten years.

100
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,600
You have grown older.

101
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,440
Lord,

102
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,080
I have things to report.

103
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,400
Go ahead.

104
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,760
Lord,

105
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,840
I have been

106
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,840
protecting the Lake of Dragon

107
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,920
with Mu Territory for ten years

108
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,440
under your order.

109
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,840
But recently,

110
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,160
I heard from others that

111
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,760
the Lake wants to drain Beiling

112
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,200
out of power by swallowing the magic plants.

113
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,920
And...

114
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,960
And what?

115
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,320
And...

116
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,120
the eye in the Lake

117
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,960
is one of

118
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,040
the legendary Nine Evil Eyes.

119
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,560
Since it’s legend,

120
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,400
you think it’s true?

121
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,320
Liu Territory has benefited a lot from the Lake...

122
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,480
Ruler Liu, are you giving me your word?

123
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,160
How do you think about

124
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,320
the power in this plant?

125
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,440
This plant is full of great power.

126
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,680
It’s really rare.

127
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,600
It’s just the secret magic of Dragon Clan.

128
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,760
The magic plants rising here

129
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,120
are full of power,

130
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,840
but they will wither if you don’t use them.

131
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,960
Ruler Liu,

132
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,840
you are smart one.

133
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,440
The Lake of Dragon is Dragon Clan’s creation.

134
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,880
It can’t be baleful.

135
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,880
Lord, you’re right.

136
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,040
Do you know

137
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,720
who spread that rumor?

138
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,460
[Mo Xingtian, General of Black Dragon]

139
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,400
Before I came here,

140
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,200
I have found out who did that.

141
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,040
It’s son of Ruler Mu,

142
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,920
Mu Chen.

143
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,600
Mu Chen?

144
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,400
Why is that?

145
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,640
Mu Feng went to Liu Territory to ask

146
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,160
for cooperation

147
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,960
to destroy the Lake of Dragon.

148
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,720
I know it’s not right.

149
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,120
So I wanted to report it to you.

150
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,200
But I have no evidence.

151
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,400
I didn’t dare to say that.

152
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,760
Please give me your advice.

153
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,760
If Mu Feng wants to work with you,

154
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,280
you can promise him.

155
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,840
Take this token. You can get in touch with me anytime.

156
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,800
Maybe this time

157
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,360
is the chance for your Liu Territory

158
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,880
to win.

159
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,800
Thank you, Lord.

160
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,160
Why me again?

161
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,160
You’re my friend.

162
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,240
You should help me.

163
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,760
Friend…

164
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,800
At least give me a range!

165
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
We are not going

166
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,400
to find it even next year in this way.

167
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,720
I give you a range.

168
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,280
Are you sure?

169
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,120
Big bird,

170
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,320
colorful,

171
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,800
big face.

172
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,080
How could you call it a range?

173
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,240
Are you sure about that?

174
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,280
That’s true.

175
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,720
But that’s all I know.

176
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,160
The news is spreading all over the School.

177
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,000
No one even knew

178
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,840
that there is a person from the Three Ancient Clans.

179
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,400
Mu Chen,

180
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,240
what are the Three Ancient Clans?

181
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,080
Tailing,

182
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,200
Futu,

183
00:10:59,320 --> 00:10:59,920
Luo.

184
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,840
They have been existing from ancient times.

185
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,680
And they have their own strength.

186
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,720
Futu is good at suppressing.

187
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,400
Luo is good at sound signaling

188
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,280
and they know everything about the world.

189
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,680
And Tailing

190
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,360
is protecting an ancient Circle,

191
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,640
All-embracing Circle.

192
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,520
But the book doesn’t tell us the use

193
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,720
of that Circle.

194
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,240
Anyway, the Three Ancient Clans

195
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,560
shoulder the responsibility of guarding the world.

196
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,240
Every one of these Clans has great power

197
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,240
and long life.

198
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,120
What?

199
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,920
How do you know about these things?

200
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,680
Do you remember the little goddess

201
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,640
I met

202
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,320
in Dragon Palace ten years ago?

203
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,800
Yes.

204
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,800
It’s her?

205
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,880
Are you sure?

206
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,880
I’ll protect you.

207
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,520
They have the same sign on forehead.

208
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,040
It can’t be wrong.

209
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,560
After we escaped from the Palace,

210
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,840
she passed out.

211
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,400
So did I.

212
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,400
I thought

213
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,680
I would never meet her again.

214
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,040
But…

215
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,120
You are so destined for each other!

216
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,800
You meet each other again after such a long time.

217
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,200
Does she remember you?

218
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,320
It seems not.

219
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,240
But I will find a chance.

220
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,400
Why don’t you just tell her directly?

221
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,480
No way!

222
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,560
I made her lose her thing.

223
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,760
I can’t tell her

224
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,000
before I find it back.

225
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,920
Qingshan!

226
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,840
I found it!

227
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,320
That’s it?

228
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,000
Yes!

229
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,600
Beiming Golden Eagle,

230
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,040
likes to eat metal.

231
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,040
It must be this.

232
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:14,960
Mu Chen.

233
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,400
Why are you walking so quiet?

234
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,680
What’s up?

235
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:20,920
My father said

236
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,040
he will go with your father

237
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,000
to search the Lake of Dragon.

238
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:23,960
What’s your plan?

239
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,840
My father

240
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,320
only asked me to wait in School.

241
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,800
I can’t go with him.

242
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,520
What?

243
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,400
You want to go there?

244
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,160
My father didn’t let me go with him either.

245
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,600
I’m just worried.

246
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,880
Let me see you in the test.

247
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,520
Aren’t you afraid

248
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,920
that I’ll take your first place?

249
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,360
Do it if you can.

250
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,280
I’m leaving now.

251
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,360
Mu Chen.

252
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,200
Here,

253
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,720
the result of the last test.

254
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,320
It’s nothing special.

255
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,680
I didn’t get any score.

256
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,480
I knew it.

257
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,200
You quitted the test halfway yourself.

258
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,840
Your grade should be great actually.

259
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,280
Anyway,

260
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,200
rules are rules.

261
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,000
Both you and Mubai got a zero.

262
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:17,800
Mu Chen,

263
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,720
although you are on holiday

264
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,480
and there is no class

265
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,280
before the selection,

266
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,920
you can’t slack off

267
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,400
during the holiday.

268
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,640
You should ask others for advice.

269
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,120
I hope you won’t get a zero again.

270
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,760
Who should I ask for?

271
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,840
Mr. Mo,

272
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,280
how is Luo Li recently?

273
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,160
After you took her away that day,

274
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,440
I haven’t seen her again.

275
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,320
What do you want to see her for?

276
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,480
She was almost possessed by

277
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,400
devil in Power-gathering Circle that day.

278
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,360
I just…

279
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,760
care about her.

280
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,080
Calm down.

281
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,680
Luo Li is doing good now.

282
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,640
Take good care of her.

283
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,560
Luo Li?

284
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,520
You…

285
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,880
How are you these days?

286
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,240
Luo Li?

287
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,440
I’m fine.

288
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,640
What?

289
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,960
What’s the matter?

290
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,000
Holiday.

291
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,280
Live in your home.

292
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:27,840
Can’t I?

293
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,440
What did you say?

294
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,440
You want to live in my home during the holiday?

295
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,080
Mr. Mo agreed.

296
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,640
Then that’s OK.

297
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,720
How long do you want to live in my place?

298
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,120
Days.

299
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:41,720
OK.

300
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,720
Welcome!

301
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,040
Thanks.

302
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,120
Qingshan,

303
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,080
am I dreaming?

304
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,480
No.

305
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,400
Wait for me!

306
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,400
Qian’er…

307
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,560
Hey!

308
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,440
You scared me!

309
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,480
Is this the picture of the Dragon-elephant Circle?

310
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,000
You’re not good at magic circle.

311
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,840
When did you start to study it?

312
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,800
I can’t study it because I’m not good at it?

313
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,040
I want to!

314
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,680
This Circle is too complicated.

315
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,680
It won’t be effective

316
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,720
for you to study it.

317
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,120
I recommend you to start from second-level circle.

318
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,360
Qian’er,

319
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,680
it’s upside down.

320
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,120
You…

321
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,040
I didn’t mean that.

322
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,200
Why are you still here?

323
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,000
Don’t you need to go home?

324
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,560
I plan to prepare for the test here for days.

325
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,240
It’s so noisy in my home.

326
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,600
I don’t want to go back.

327
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,920
You’re good at magic circle, right?

328
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:05,760
Not bad.

329
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,349
Then teach me.

330
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:10,960
Teach you?

331
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,160
Yes.

332
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,560
You will stay here for days, right?

333
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,280
I won’t go home either.

334
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,400
I’ll stay here to keep you company.

335
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,069
Don’t think too much.

336
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,829
I didn’t mean other things.

337
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,240
I just want you to teach me.

338
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,589
Do you agree?

339
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:28,040
I’ll go home if you don’t.

340
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,320
I do!

341
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,200
Of course I do.

342
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,400
Aren’t you afraid I’ll take up your time?

343
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:35,800
I’m not.

344
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,360
Teaching you is the most important.

345
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,920
I can take that as a review.

346
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,920
It’s win-win.

347
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,600
That’s great.

348
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,920
Evil Deity,

349
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,000
humans have found that the Eye of Source

350
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,280
is absorbing the power of the land.

351
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,200
How did that be exposed?

352
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,560
A student of Beiling School

353
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,000
called Mu Chen found it

354
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,720
in a test.

355
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,920
He stumbled into

356
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,280
a place where the power had dried up in the test

357
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,760
and found the Eye of Source was absorbing power.

358
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,840
If…

359
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,680
If only one person found that,

360
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,040
it won’t cause influence to our plan.

361
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,800
But this news will be spread soon.

362
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,280
Then all the Beiling will unite.

363
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,600
Evil Deity,

364
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,560
I can eradicate them.

365
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,320
Don’t bother.

366
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,280
I’ll make someone

367
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,640
to get us rid of those humans.

368
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,920
If it’s not because of my wound,

369
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,600
the Five Sects

370
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,880
are nothing to me.

371
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,360
Evil Deity,

372
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,480
you can give me the Sumeru Pillar,

373
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,640
I will…

374
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,120
Hurt by White Dragon,

375
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,160
and get him take away the Sumeru Pillar.

376
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,600
You are the only one to blame.

377
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,360
Black Dragon,

378
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,960
don’t worry too much.

379
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,760
Take good care of the Eye of Source.

380
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,600
That will be good to your wound as well.

381
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,080
As long as I can revive successfully,

382
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,560
Sumeru Pillar, Dragon Clan, power,

383
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,320
everything will be yours.

384
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,640
Lord,

385
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,040
is Evil Deity sending someone to us?

386
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,400
Evil Deity has an adopted daughter

387
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,600
who has been accompanying

388
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,080
him since five thousand years ago.

389
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,840
She is not inferior to me.

390
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,140
[Deity Tower]

391
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,620
[Wen Qingxuan, Evil Deity’s adopted daughter]

392
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,040
Father,

393
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,160
I’m here.

394
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,000
My home is there.

395
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,480
I’m leaving now.

396
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,200
See you.

397
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,680
Luo Li…

398
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,560
Something wrong.

399
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,520
Goddess,

400
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,680
how to say that?

401
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,680
Right,

402
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,640
encounter is better than appointment.

403
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,080
Since we meet here,

404
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,880
follow me to see our Leader.

405
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,360
In your dream.

406
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,320
Please think it over.

407
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,520
As long as you marry our Leader,

408
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,120
your whole clan will be honored and wealthy.

409
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,440
Please don’t refuse.

410
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,200
Why bother to be so stubborn?

411
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,120
I know you are from the God Clan.

412
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,400
We are God Clan as well.

413
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,040
A marriage between two God Clans,

414
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:31,920
isn’t that perfect?

415
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,120
You don’t deserve that.

416
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,200
Luo Li, you want it to get worse?

417
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,680
Come on!

418
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:55,880
Mu Chen!

419
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,800
Chen!

420
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,240
Another one?

421
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,520
You humans

422
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,280
want to beat our God Clan?

423
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,560
Fight!

424
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,040
Who are you?

425
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,520
How dare you step into our affair?

426
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,320
Ruler of Mu Territory, Mu Feng.

427
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,520
This is human’s place.

428
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,640
Don’t push it too far.

429
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,680
Mu Feng.

430
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,560
OK.

431
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,320
Let’s go.

432
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,720
Zhou Ye!

433
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,800
Father,

434
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,640
you came right in time.

435
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,840
Chen, are you OK?

436
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,680
I’m fine.

437
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,840
Mr. Mu.

438
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:21,800
Luo Li,

439
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,200
I heard from Mr. Mo.

440
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,440
Don’t worry.

441
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,320
You’ll be safe in our place.

442
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,520
We Mu Territory

443
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,720
are not going to lose a girl.

444
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,480
Dark Blood Spell.

445
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,280
What are you doing?

446
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,920
Can you knock the door

447
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,360
before coming in next time?

448
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,040
Don’t move.

449
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,920
That was the first time I met Xue God Clan.

450
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,440
They are really fierce and ugly.

451
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,440
But,

452
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,680
aren’t there only Three Ancient Clans?

453
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,280
Xue God Clan is guilty.

454
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,440
They showed up after exile.

455
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,320
We are

456
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,040
neighbors.

457
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,480
You mean…

458
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,640
Xue God Clan

459
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,880
came into being after being exiled

460
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,240
by the Three Ancient God Clans?

461
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,040
Their territory

462
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,320
is next to Luo God Clan?

463
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,920
They want revenge.

464
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,200
Isn’t Luo God Clan one of the Three Ancient God Clans?

465
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,920
You must be strong.

466
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,720
We used to be.

467
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,640
Not now.

468
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,200
So…

469
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,440
Find Jiuyou Bird.

470
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,560
Xue Lingzi

471
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,480
wants a marriage.

472
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,000
Xue Lingzi is the Leader of Xue God Clan?

473
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,520
That means…

474
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,200
Xue God Clan

475
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,400
is next to Luo God Clan.

476
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,280
After they appeared on the horizon,

477
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,800
they always bully your Clan,

478
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,680
even blackmail you into marrying him.

479
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,720
Then can you beat them

480
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
after you find Jiuyou Bird?

481
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,880
We are not united.

482
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,600
I have to get Jiuyou spirit blood

483
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,320
to summon the Spirit of Luo.

484
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,280
Then make it through,

485
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,000
and become the Saintess.

486
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,240
You can unite the people

487
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,720
after you become the Saintess?

488
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,440
But there are so many beasts on the Record.

489
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,040
Only Jiuyou can help you to do that?

490
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,320
It’s irreplaceable.

491
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,000
Sorry.

492
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,320
It’s fine.

493
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,200
You…

494
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,640
You look familiar.

495
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,440
Ten years ago.

496
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,800
You were weak.

497
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,760
But you protected me.

498
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,160
First friend.

499
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,720
But you must be

500
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,120
eight or nine ten years ago.

501
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,360
How could you not…

502
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,240
I only practice.

503
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,760
No friends.

504
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,400
No wonder

505
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,880
you can’t even talk well now.

506
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,480
I…

507
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,880
I’m not laughing at you.

508
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,200
And I’m surprised that

509
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,680
you have made progress

510
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,680
in talking today.

511
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,080
See you.

512
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,800
Thanks

513
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,160
For today..

514
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,760
Luo Li!

515
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,720
Do you want to learn

516
00:26:59,120 --> 00:26:59,920
to talk from me?

517
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,160
It turns out that

518
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,040
the friend Mr. Mo made before

519
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,360
is your grandfather.

520
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,760
I didn’t expect that.

521
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,200
It’s been thirty years ago.

522
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:40,440
I visited the Three Ancient God Clans
together with Mr. Mo.

523
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,440
We failed to find Tailing Clan,

524
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,080
then we passed by the Futu Clan

525
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,400
and met some trouble.

526
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,920
So I didn’t visit Luo God Clan.

527
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,040
Luo Li,

528
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,680
what’s your next plan?

529
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,200
Take the test.

530
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,520
Find Jiuyou.

531
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,400
I got it.

532
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,840
You mean

533
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,560
the Five Sects’ guard

534
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,600
is heavier than here.

535
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,480
If you can join them,

536
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,320
Xue God Clan

537
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,680
will shrink back from difficulties.

538
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,320
It’s good for your safety,

539
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:22,960
right?

540
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,160
Yes.

541
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,320
Luo Li,

542
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,240
come on,

543
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,000
it’s time for class.

544
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,400
So rude!

545
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,360
Don’t you see I’m talking with her?

546
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,240
Qingshan and I had appointment to teach Luo Li to talk.

547
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,200
Bye.

548
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,720
Talk?

549
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,720
Luo Li,

550
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,560
the biggest problem of your talk

551
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,640
is it’s too simple.

552
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,000
Although others can understand you,

553
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,960
it’s still a little difficult.

554
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,680
That sounds tired.

555
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,080
So you have to learn

556
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,520
how to say an entire sentence.

557
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,280
I think

558
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,000
you can make a balance.

559
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,760
It will also sound tired if you

560
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,760
speak too much.

561
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,680
Tan Qingshan!

562
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,560
You’re here to help.

563
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,040
Not to cause trouble.

564
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,560
OK, fine.

565
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,360
Luo Li,

566
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,800
if you want to speak an entire sentence,

567
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,120
you have to learn to use

568
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,960
personal pronouns.

569
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,040
You also use them sometimes.

570
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,640
But do you know what they mean?

571
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:29,160
You, I, he.

572
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:29,800
See?

573
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,800
I knew it.

574
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,480
I knew you know their meanings.

575
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,000
That’ll be easy.

576
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,960
Then it’s about how to use them.

577
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,600
Like,

578
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,680
“I stole your Jiezi Coin.”

579
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,400
He didn’t! He didn’t steal it!

580
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,240
I didn’t!

581
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,680
I didn’t do that!

582
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,840
It’s just an example.

583
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,840
I didn’t!

584
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,520
Repeat it with me.

585
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,080
I…

586
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,160
I…

587
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,960
Stole…

588
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,400
Stole…

589
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,440
Your…

590
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,360
Your…

591
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,400
Jie…Jiezi Coin.

592
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,480
Jiezi Coin.

593
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:12,680
OK.

594
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,480
Make a sentence now.

595
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:21,440
Jiezi Coin stole your I.

596
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,640
That’s called “The language fails to express the words.”

597
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,360
Fails to express the meaning!

598
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,120
I’m better than her anyway.

599
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,440
It’s all your fault.

600
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,720
I talk worse now.

601
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,080
That’s a great sentence.

602
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,040
Again.

603
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,240
It’s late now.

604
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,400
Thank… you.

605
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,640
You should say “Thank you and him”.

606
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,440
But you don’t need to thank him.

607
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,160
Luo Li,

608
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,800
it’s already good enough

609
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,800
for you to learn like this now.

610
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,440
I have faith in you.

611
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,520
I want to show you something.

612
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,640
This is…

613
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,400
I have searched it in School.

614
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,720
The bird took your Jiezi Coin

615
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,240
is called Beiming Golden Eagle.

616
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,040
It has Gold and Fire elements.

617
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,480
And it likes these two kind of color.

618
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,640
So I made this circle

619
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,800
with these two elements together.

620
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,280
It’s colorful and shining.

621
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,240
I think this can attract it.

622
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,040
But…

623
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:45,720
Stop that.

624
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,800
Use your power to help me start the circle.

625
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,480
That’s not the time I calculated.

626
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,400
Does it

627
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,960
have a name?

628
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,680
Luo Li,

629
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,720
it’s designed for you.

630
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,480
How about you name it?

631
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,280
Rosemary Circle.

632
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,520
That’s a good name!

633
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,360
Father,

634
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,880
it’s already so late.

635
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:07,800
Why are you still here?

636
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,120
I want to ask you some questions.

637
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,280
You have to tell me the truth.

638
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,560
What’s wrong?

639
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,240
You look serious.

640
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,600
How do you think about Luo Li?

641
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,120
Luo Li?

642
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,960
She…

643
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,440
is powerful,

644
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,080
brave,

645
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,320
not good at talking.

646
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,360
She is kind,

647
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,600
and beautiful.

648
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,120
Next question.

649
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,360
Do you know her identity?

650
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,280
I know.

651
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,440
She is from Luo God Clan.

652
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,120
Do you know

653
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,400
a love between human and god

654
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,120
won’t have any result?

655
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,800
What end will you have?

656
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,280
I don’t know.

657
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,160
But, father,

658
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,200
isn’t it too early

659
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,200
for you to think about that?

660
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,240
The earlier, the better.

661
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,760
God Clans attach great importance to bloodline.

662
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,760
They taboo mixed marriages.

663
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,480
You and Luo Li

664
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,600
won’t have result.

665
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,710
How do you know that

666
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,040
if you don’t give it a try?

667
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,190
Don’t bother to try.

668
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,400
Father,

669
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,150
what do you mean?

670
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,000
Chen,

671
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,080
remember to keep

672
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,800
what I tell you next a secret.

673
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,800
Your mother

674
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,400
is a goddess of God Clans.

675
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,520
My mother

676
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,280
is a goddess?

677
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:57,960
Father,

678
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,200
stop kidding me.

679
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,120
The reason why I never

680
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,160
mentioned this before

681
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,760
is because you were still young,

682
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,840
and you couldn’t bear it.

683
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,640
Now you’ve grown up,

684
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,640
and you have your own idea.

685
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,000
I can’t hide it from you anymore.

686
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,400
Your mom is the goddess of Futu Clan.

687
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,080
She used to be the

688
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,600
successor of the Futu Clan’s Leader.

689
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,080
My mother is Futu’s goddess?

690
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,200
That means

691
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,680
she is still alive?

692
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,360
Yanjing,

693
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,680
where are you going?

694
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,380
[Qing Yanjing, Goddess of Futu Clan]

695
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,040
Are you…

696
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,680
going to abandon me and Chen?

697
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,360
I’m the goddess of Futu Clan.

698
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,200
It’s my duty to go back to Futu Clan.

699
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,120
No.

700
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,040
No!

701
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,440
You’re lying.

702
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,080
He forced you, right?

703
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,040
Did he force you?

704
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,360
Tell me!

705
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,680
You are human, but I’m a goddess.

706
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,640
Fool.

707
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,280
How could we be in love?

708
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,080
Qing Yanjing,

709
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,680
you married a human without permission

710
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,960
and gave birth to a son.

711
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,680
Now you’ll be removed from the position of goddess.

712
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,000
Go back to Futu to take your punishment.

713
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,920
Where is that kid now?

714
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,700
[Futu Xuan, Leader of Futu Clan]

715
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,600
You don’t want to say?

716
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:20,840
Let’s go.

717
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,840
I’ll go back with you.

718
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,800
That means my mother was sentenced

719
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,080
to protect us

720
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,200
from being found.

721
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,680
You lied to me.

722
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,920
You told me

723
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,920
my mother died

724
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,120
when gave birth to me.

725
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,280
You said she was buried in the maple trees.

726
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,040
I went to worship every year.

727
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,000
How could you

728
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,560
lie to me?

729
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,400
If mother is still alive,

730
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,040
why don’t you

731
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,600
go to save her these years?

732
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,440
I…

733
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,760
I can’t make it.

734
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,160
Father,

735
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,440
I’m sorry.

736
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,720
I shouldn’t be mad at you.

737
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,040
No.

738
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,640
You were right.

739
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,960
I feel ashamed.

740
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,520
Chen.

741
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,440
I told you this today

742
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,320
because I don’t want you make mistakes again.

743
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,560
You should

744
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,440
learn from our mistakes.

745
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,040
Father,

746
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,720
I’ll go to the selection of the Five Sects.

747
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,560
I want to get stronger

748
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,520
It’s not only because I want to save my mom,

749
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,640
or I want to be with Luo Li.

750
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,400
I want to protect my family

751
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,920
from other dangers.

752
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,080
The test will be full of difficulties.

753
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,520
Let alone joining the Five Sects,

754
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,120
it’s already a difficulty for you

755
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,640
to save your own life.

756
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,720
My mother is the goddess.

757
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,240
Do I really have no power?

758
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,000
That’s OK.

759
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,240
I’m used to it.

760
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,680
However dangerous it will be,

761
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,160
I will go.
