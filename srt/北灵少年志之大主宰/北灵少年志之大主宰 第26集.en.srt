1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available.]


2
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,600
If we can’t unlock the seal,


3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,720
you will be trapped in his consciousness


4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,350
and can never get out.


5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,230
Mu Chen,


6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,200
although I can feel his consciousness,


7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,200
it’s fluctuating abnormally.


8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,390
It’s too dangerous.


9
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:22,520
Luo Li,


10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,550
we can’t wait anymore.


11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,760
Even if we can,


12
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,200
there is no time for North Sect


13
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,760
and White Horse City.


14
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:30,600
OK.


15
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,000
I will go with you.


16
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,110
My power can pacify him.


17
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,240
I’m in.


18
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,950
You still need my help.


19
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,840
I’ll go with you as well.


20
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,080
Bai Tong,


21
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,880
after we go into his consciousness,


22
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,240
our bodies can’t move.


23
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,910
We still need you to protect us.


24
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:46,950
Besides,


25
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,430
if something bad happens,


26
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,430
we need you to inform Lord Bai


27
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,150
right away.


28
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,680
Fine.


29
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,400
You have to be careful.


30
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,910
Jiuyou,


31
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,360
take care.


32
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:38,700
The Great Ruler


33
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,579
Episode 26


34
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,030
Aren't the Dragon Clan almost wiped out?


35
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,390
Why are there so many their people?


36
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,600
This must be the Dragon Palace


37
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,910
when the Dragon Clan


38
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,240
was still prosperous in his dream.


39
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,000
But they can’t see us.


40
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,320
We should find Lord White Dragon first.


41
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,550
Let’s go to the front.


42
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,470
Black Dragon and White Dragon,


43
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,600
as the purest descendants of the Dragon Clan,


44
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,440
will become the apprentices of Master Yalong


45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,390
to study the secret magic of Dragon Clan.


46
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,829
The day you master it


47
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,160
will be the day when the next king takes the throne.


48
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,390
At that time,


49
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,670
I will give the treasure,


50
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:28,070
Sumeru Pillar, to the winner of you in person.


51
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,720
If you want to get it


52
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,230
and rule the whole clan,


53
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,480
it depends on which one of you


54
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,600
can learn more from me.


55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,720
When the next crisis comes,


56
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,270
our clan will perish or reborn


57
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,550
in your hands.


58
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,350
Perish and reborn?


59
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,950
What does Master Yalong mean?


60
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,640
I don’t know.


61
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,880
It sounds like a prediction.


62
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,320
Lord White Dragon.


63
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,950
Lord White Dragon.


64
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,830
Lord White Dragon, please wake up.


65
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,440
Lord White Dragon…


66
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,760
How could it be?


67
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,510
What’s going on?


68
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,880
It’s totally different now.


69
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,760
Dreams are fragmented.


70
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,640
If one dream ends,


71
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,159
we will follow his consciousness


72
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,390
to the next dream.


73
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,920
They must be
the young Black Dragon and White Dragon.


74
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,950
Just like before,


75
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,270
we can’t touch him


76
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,830
and communicate with him


77
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,480
in his dream.


78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,670
To the people in dreams,


79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,320
we are nonexistent.


80
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,159
Of course they can’t hear us


81
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,350
and see us,


82
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,720
let alone touch us.


83
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,510
I’m going to do it.


84
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,230
Come on.


85
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,760
I have been waiting for long.


86
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,440
What’s wrong?


87
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,600
Don’t scare me.


88
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,480
I didn’t use too much power just now.


89
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,230
Let’s call it an end.


90
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,600
It’s always the same.


91
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,159
I knew you would stop.


92
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,720
Aren’t you afraid of being beaten by me?


93
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,480
You always ask me to have a battle.


94
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,640
And you always play tricks to win.


95
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,830
Tricks?


96
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,600
Victory is victory.


97
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,640
If you want to win,


98
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,920
you should do whatever you can.


99
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,920
Nonsense.


100
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,320
Never mind.


101
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,390
You win.


102
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,480
Let’s go to have some food.


103
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:49,390
I’m so hungry now.


104
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,390
You can go first.


105
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,640
I want to do more practice.


106
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,200
What to do now?


107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,110
Do we have to keep watching his dreams?


108
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,640
These dream fragments


109
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,200
should be Lord White Dragon’s
most precious memories.


110
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,390
The way to wake him up


111
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,790
must be hidden in these.


112
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,390
Maybe someone


113
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,640
or


114
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
some matter.


115
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,000
Where are we now?


116
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,390
I know.


117
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,920
It’s the battle field


118
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,920
when Evil Deity fought with the God of Heaven.


119
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,920
It’s said that as the guardian,


120
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,140
[Lord White Dragon  Guardian of Dragon Clan]


121
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,160
Dragon Clan fought against the Evilness Clan.


122
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,640
But they were completely annihilated.


123
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,520
That’s right.


124
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,710
Do you remember


125
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,150
the prediction about perish or reborn?


126
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,110
This must be the “perish”.


127
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,710
It seems that the war


128
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,400
was really brutal.


129
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,030
This


130
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,710
is Evil Deity?


131
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,080
Evil Deity,


132
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,760
we would never give up!


133
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,620
[Evil Deity]


134
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,200
No matter how hard you fight,


135
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,230
you won't change your fate.


136
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,760
Join with me.


137
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,640
I will let you know


138
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,440
what real power is.


139
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,550
Cut the crap.


140
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,230
Let’s fight!


141
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,670
Sumeru Pillar.


142
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,910
It’s a waste for it


143
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,640
to be in your hands.


144
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,760
Today, let me teach you


145
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,960
how to use it correctly.


146
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,590
Mu Chen, watch out!


147
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,880
This Sumeru Pillar exists!


148
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,520
No!


149
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,840
Sunvo Seal


150
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,110
can’t maintain the teleporting formation anymore.


151
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,760
How could this Sumeru Pillar


152
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,110
is an entity here?


153
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,550
Logically,


154
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,840
everything in the dream


155
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,470
should be nonexistent.


156
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,400
There's only one possibility.


157
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,790
His obsessiveness


158
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,400
is the Sumeru Pillar.


159
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,150
People whose power is at supreme level


160
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,520
can make consciousness into entity.


161
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,760
If the Sumeru Pillar


162
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,670
is really his obsessiveness,


163
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,840
the Sumeru Pillar here


164
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,760
must be made of his consciousness.


165
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,840
If we can break this Sumeru Pillar,


166
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,280
his consciousness


167
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,520
will wake up.


168
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,000
Look!


169
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,400
White Dragon and Black Dragon!


170
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,880
Finally it all ends.


171
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:27,150
The world is at peace!


172
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,590
Is it worth


173
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,110
our efforts?


174
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,960
I don’t know.


175
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,840
I only know


176
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,880
it’s our responsibility


177
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,000
to protect the world.


178
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,230
World?


179
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,910
We paid so much


180
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,150
for the whole world.


181
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,880
Will it be grateful?


182
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,320
Look how unfortunate we are now.


183
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,590
It’s time for the world to return!


184
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,550
What are you doing?


185
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,640
Don’t do this!


186
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,470
I will revive the Dragon Clan!


187
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,960
Do you remember Master’s prediction?


188
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,670
Our clan will perish or reborn


189
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:23,150
in our hands.


190
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,440
Black Dragon!


191
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,150
White Dragon’s consciousness was steady before.


192
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,470
But it’s shaking acutely now.


193
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,910
His next dream


194
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,670
must be the key point to wake him up.


195
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,110
I’m ready now.


196
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,030
It’s the Dragon Palace.


197
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,590
Why are we here again?


198
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,230
His consciousness was shaking so acutely.


199
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,320
I think this dream


200
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,000
must matter a lot


201
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,320
to…


202
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,030
to White Dragon.


203
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:14,670
White Dragon,


204
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,110
follow me and you will know it.


205
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,110
Someone is talking there.


206
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,670
What is this?


207
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,470
Why are here so many of these?


208
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,520
It’s…


209
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,400
the dragon egg?


210
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,150
But it looks strange.


211
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,760
It’s like a stone.


212
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,550
Black Dragon,


213
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,550
this is what you said?


214
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,640
This is how you meant


215
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,640
to make the Human Clan return?


216
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:15,760
You…


217
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,520
What do you want to do to the eggs?


218
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,590
To revive Dragon Clan,


219
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,710
of course I have to hatch these eggs!


220
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,440
Black Dragon,


221
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,710
we both know that


222
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,760
these eggs have long been petrified and dead.


223
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,230
They can’t be hatched at all!


224
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,110
Don’t you remember Sumeru Pillar?


225
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,320
With its power,


226
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,030
they can be hatched!


227
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:32,520
You…


228
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,440
Black Dragon,


229
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,960
Sumeru Pillar


230
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,200
is our clan’s treasure.


231
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,000
It’s not for you to kill here!


232
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,030
Clan’s treasure


233
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,710
should be used by us!


234
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,470
As long as it absorbs enough power,


235
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,000
these eggs can be hatched.


236
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,910
Then our clan can be revived!


237
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,000
Black Dragon!


238
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,400
Black Dragon!


239
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:51,760
Do you deserve


240
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,030
the clan’s honor of


241
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,880
defending the whole world by doing this?


242
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,320
Don’t think I’m brutal.


243
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,550
It’s what they


244
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,670
owe us.


245
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,320
You…


246
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,080
Black Dragon!


247
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,400
You know what.


248
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,000
Even if I die,


249
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,880
I won’t let you do this.


250
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:13,590
We are the only ones left in Dragon Clan.


251
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,640
If you want to stop me,


252
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,710
then kill me.


253
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,960
The Dragon Clan


254
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:24,230
will never die like this.


255
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,440
Black Dragon!


256
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,590
Black Dragon!


257
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,470
White Dragon’s obsessiveness


258
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,150
is Sumeru Pillar.


259
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,440
This pillar


260
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,710
is the key to unlock his dream.


261
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,960
What happened?


262
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,670
Why is my power so weak now?


263
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,880
The evil eye in the sea


264
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,670
keeps absorbing our power.


265
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,280
We have been here for long,


266
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,150
of course we have lost a lot of power.


267
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,440
What to do now?


268
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,280
We have to bet now.


269
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,910
Spare no pains.


270
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,960
Lord White Dragon!


271
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,710
They made it!


272
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,790
Mu Chen!


273
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,910
We did it!


274
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,110
Jiuyou!


275
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:58,840
There is a guest.


276
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,280
There is a guest.


277
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,670
There is a guest.


278
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,030
There is a guest.


279
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,349
There is a guest.


280
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,190
Lord Bai.


281
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,190
You are?


282
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,520
I’m Liu Mubai,


283
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,230
from North Sect.


284
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,470
I’m here for my friend, Mu Chen.


285
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:16,040
Mu Chen is your friend?


286
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:16,920
Yes.


287
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,160
To help North Sect,


288
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,190
he came here


289
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,760
to find Lord White Dragon.


290
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:25,000
He sent me message days ago,


291
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,920
saying that he had found Lord White Dragon.


292
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,110
Then I haven’t heard from him since that.


293
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,560
I’m worried.


294
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,710
So I came here.


295
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,560
Lord Bai,


296
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,520
do you know where he is now?


297
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,160
Mr. Liu,


298
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,110
now


299
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,000
White Horse City is suffering from
the evil eye in the sea.


300
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,280
It controls all the residents here.


301
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,190
Mu Chen and his friends


302
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,160
did come here.


303
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,310
But they found that our city is dead


304
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,160
and Lord White Dragon is not here.


305
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,110
So they left.


306
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,190
No way.


307
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,110
If he had left,


308
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:03,950
he would have told me.


309
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,760
What’s more,


310
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,430
if he knew that this city is in trouble,


311
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,310
he would never stand by.


312
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,160
I’m sure that


313
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,520
he is


314
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,710
helping to save your city.


315
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,710
Please don’t misunderstand my friend.


316
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,950
Is Mu Chen


317
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,350
really a chivalrous man?


318
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,190
I’m afraid


319
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,760
you don’t know him well.


320
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,920
To be honest,


321
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,350
Mu Chen and his friends


322
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,920
have left the city days ago.


323
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,190
I don’t know where they are now.


324
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,710
He must be


325
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,000
out of town trying to save the city.


326
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,000
Maybe he is in trouble now.


327
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,160
But you’re being sarcastic here.


328
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,560
With a lord like you,


329
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,920
I think this is what


330
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,280
this city deserves.


331
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,160
Wait.


332
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,230
You’re really Mu Chen’s friend.


333
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,710
Like what you said,


334
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,400
Mu Chen is in the illusion under the sea,


335
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,230
trying to destroy the evil eye.


336
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,230
Please forgive my lies just now.


337
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,430
It’s for the safety of him and the city.


338
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,760
I have to do that.


339
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,230
Illusion under the sea?


340
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:19,950
Yes.


341
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,800
I used Sunvo Seal


342
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,230
as the magic stone to make a teleporting formation.


343
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,310
They have gone to the illusion under the sea


344
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,680
through that teleporting formation.


345
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,640
They are trying to


346
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,230
save the Lord White Dragon who are sealed there


347
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,070
and destroy the evil eye.


348
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,470
How are they now?


349
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:40,950
I don’t know.


350
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,110
But,


351
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,760
the power of Sunvo Seal


352
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,430
can’t last long now.


353
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,230
If they don’t come back later,


354
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,400
they will be trapped there forever.


355
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,230
We…


356
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,520
We are back here?


357
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,520
Finally you are back.


358
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,230
How is it?


359
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,110
Did you wake him up?


360
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,310
Luo Li,


361
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,520
what’s wrong?


362
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,000
I can’t feel


363
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,710
his consciousness now.


364
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,310
There is no fluctuation now?


365
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,520
Then…


366
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,880
He is dying.


367
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,190
If Lord White Dragon can’t wake up


368
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,280
and dies here,


369
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,950
North Sect will be attacked by Black Dragon.


370
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,000
Lord White Dragon!


371
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,470
Lord White Dragon!


372
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,190
You can’t die!


373
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,710
Lord White Dragon!


374
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,160
I didn’t expect that I will die here


375
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,350
not long after I became Jiuyou Bird.


376
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,880
But,


377
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,470
it was worth it


378
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,590
to die with the dragon


379
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,590
and the treasure of Dragon Clan.


380
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,190
Sumeru Pillar?


381
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,430
I remember it!


382
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,560
Look!


383
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,830
He is awake!


384
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,560
It was such a long dream.


385
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,040
Lord White Dragon.


386
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,350
Don’t bother.


387
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,680
It all thanks to you


388
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,830
that I can wake up.


389
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,520
Kid,


390
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,590
it’s been ten years.


391
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,040
You have grown up.


392
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,040
Lord,


393
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,430
you still remember me?


394
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:54,950
Of  course.


395
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,310
Lord White Dragon,


396
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,000
what happened


397
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,760
ten years ago?


398
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,920
I forgot to introduce.


399
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,430
My friends, Luo Li,


400
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,310
Jiuyou,


401
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,350
and Bai Tong.


402
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,000
I was fighting against Black Dragon that year.


403
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,560
It was a critical condition.


404
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,470
Luckily, Mu Chen showed up.


405
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,760
I taught him the spell to unlock it.


406
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,160
Sure enough,


407
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,920
it came in handy today.


408
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:21,950
Lord,


409
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,830
there is one thing


410
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,160
I still don’t understand.


411
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,590
We were strangers that year.


412
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,560
Why did you teach me the spell


413
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,110
without any hesitation?


414
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,310
Did you


415
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,070
already know what will happen at that time?


416
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,520
I can’t predict


417
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,710
a coincidence in ten years.


418
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,110
It was just a hunch.


419
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,640
The spell of Sumeru Pillar


420
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,920
is like a key.


421
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,110
The people who use it is important.


422
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,800
Mu Chen,


423
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,470
I saw kindness in your eyes


424
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,520
that year.


425
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,040
Ten years have passed,


426
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,040
it still doesn’t change.


427
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:03,830
So, your obsessiveness


428
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,590
is really the Sumeru Pillar?


429
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:06,800
Yes.


430
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,190
If Black Dragon didn’t get it,


431
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,680
the world wouldn’t have suffered


432
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,590
all this.


433
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,230
I know I am sinful.


434
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,680
Lord,


435
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,230
don’t blame yourself.


436
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,350
We saw it in your dream.


437
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,160
Black Dragon abandoned himself


438
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,560
and took refuge in Evil Deity.


439
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,560
That’s why he caused such a disaster.


440
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,310
Black Dragon and I are brothers.


441
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,040
But I can do nothing


442
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:38,710
to help him.


443
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,520
I have


444
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,160
regretted it for years.


445
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,830
So this time


446
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,880
I must make up for my mistake.


447
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,920
Mu Chen,


448
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,800
I was in the palace as well.


449
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,830
Why don’t I remember it?


450
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:56,880
And,


451
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,760
why haven’t you ever told me about it?


452
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,680
You passed out there.


453
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,280
I was the one holding you.


454
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,310
Hold me?


455
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,190
It was long ago.


456
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,160
Stop talking about it.


457
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,800
We should find a way out now.


458
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,070
No response.


459
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,350
I’m afraid I have run out of power.


460
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,230
I can’t make the Sunvo Seal work now.


461
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,280
Here,


462
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,040
give it to me.


463
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,590
Evil Deity.


464
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,880
Black Dragon,


465
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:55,430
something is wrong with the Eye of Bliss.


466
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,000
The Eye of Bliss


467
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,920
should keep sending me the power.


468
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,400
But I couldn’t


469
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,070
feel it just now.


470
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,520
And the power I received


471
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,430
is not as strong as it was before.


472
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,070
Is it because of White Dragon?


473
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,310
Did he wake up from dreams?


474
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,470
No.


475
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:18,800
It’s impossible.


476
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:21,280
Don’t forget what’s the most


477
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,880
important thing to you.


478
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,760
Whether Dragon Clan can revive or not


479
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,760
is up to you now.


480
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,520
Evil Deity,


481
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,640
don’t worry.


482
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,590
I’ll handle this.


483
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,710
Remember,


484
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,310
don’t try to hide anything from me.


485
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,310
Because


486
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,310
I’m everywhere.


487
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,590
White Dragon…


488
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,230
Is it


489
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,000
because of Liu Mubai?


490
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,920
Mu Chen,


491
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,070
you’d better succeed


492
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,310
and take Sumeru Pillar back to me.


493
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:19,680
Father!


494
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,710
Father!


495
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,710
What happened?


496
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,590
Father!


497
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,350
Father!


498
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,400
Wake up!


499
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,430
Guards?


500
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,520
Say something!


501
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,230
Mubai,


502
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:31,680
why are you here?


503
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,430
What happened here?


504
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,880
Who are you?


505
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,880
What did you do to my father?


506
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,160
I’m Liu Mubai,


507
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,590
Mu Chen’s friend.


508
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:42,590
Your father


509
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,230
was killed by his own power.


510
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,710
It was already too late when I arrived.


511
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,000
I’m sorry.


512
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,190
No!


513
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,430
No!


514
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,040
No way!


515
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,640
Bai Tong,


516
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:54,710
calm down.


517
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,000
My father’s power pulse was damaged.


518
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,430
How could he be killed by his power?


519
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,830
When I arrived,


520
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,190
he was holding that thing.


521
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,640
I felt a strong power which


522
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,230
kept me away from him.


523
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,920
When the power was gone,


524
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,710
it was too late.


525
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,230
Your father was already…


526
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,000
Sunvo Seal?


527
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,280
How could it be?


528
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,190
How could it be?


529
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,000
Bai Tong,


530
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,830
Lord Bai died for guarding the city


531
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,430
and us.


532
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,520
He is a hero.


533
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,710
If Lord Bai was really murdered,


534
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,470
I will find the murderer


535
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,680
together with you.


536
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,400
Young Master Bai,


537
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,400
I’m sorry.


538
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,710
I didn't expect you


539
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:10,160
to pay such a heavy price because of me.


540
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,520
I, White Dragon,


541
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:18,560
will never


542
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,350
forget your kindness.


543
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,280
You can leave now.


544
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,350
Leave me alone for a while.


545
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,310
You can go.


546
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,230
I will stay to comfort him.


547
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,280
Mubai,


548
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,640
why are you here?


549
00:29:59,070 --> 00:29:59,920
How is North Sect now?


550
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,520
The Protection Circle is still working.


551
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,560
We found the abnormity of Evilness Clan.


552
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
I'm afraid you're in danger.


553
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:05,710
So


554
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,920
I came to help you.


555
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,590
You have found Lord White Dragon?


556
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:19,950
Since that,


557
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,430
when will we go back?


558
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,470
I’m afraid


559
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,110
the Protection Circle can’t last long.


560
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,920
Lord White Dragon’s power has not yet returned,


561
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,800
and he may need time to recover.


562
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,430
What’s more,


563
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,680
we have to destroy the evil eye in the sea.


564
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,350
After three days of seclusion


565
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:34,950
and recovery of my power,


566
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,920
then we can destroy the evil eye.


567
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:41,710
OK.


568
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,040
No need to rush.


569
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,310
I will stay with you


570
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,400
to see if I can help you.


571
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,070
It’s good to have you help us.


572
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,000
But


573
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,880
now Evil Deity


574
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:53,070
is absorbing power from the evil eye in the sea.


575
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,110
It won’t be long


576
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,830
before he found the Sumeru Pillar.


577
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:57,430
That means


578
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:00,160
Black Dragon will come for it anytime.


579
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,110
So all of us have to


580
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,310
be prepared for a fight to the death.


581
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,710
I've been out of city


582
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,520
all these years


583
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,950
trying to keep people away,


584
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,230
and it's been a while


585
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,560
since I've had a talk with my dad.


586
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,760
No matter what trouble we met,


587
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,310
he could always handle it.


588
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,110
I think he was omnipotent.


589
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,230
You know?


590
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,350
I always had a dream


591
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,920
that my father would die like my mother.


592
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,950
But he always comforted me


593
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,000
that he wouldn’t.


594
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,640
He said he wouldn’t be controlled by evilness.


595
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
If he died,


596
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,110
he must die to protect White Horse City.


597
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,640
I trusted him


598
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,880
and I never doubted that.


599
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,040
But I…


600
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,070
I didn’t expect that it would be now,


601
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,280
when we already saw the hope.


602
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,000
Your father will feel the hope.


603
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,710
Don’t be dejected.


604
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,760
We will go to revenge together.


605
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,190
We will make the city


606
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,880
what it was like before.


607
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,520
I just regret it.


608
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,760
Is it really meaningful for us


609
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,950
to protect the White Horse City?


610
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,190
I still have a lot that I want to say to him.


611
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,000
I want to cook him a meal.


612
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,880
Why did that happened now?


613
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:31,800
From now on,


614
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,310
I will be alone.


615
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,590
Don’t say that.


616
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,430
You will never be alone.


617
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,310
I’m here with you.


618
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,800
Mu Chen,


619
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
and Luo Li,


620
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,520
we won’t make you feel lonely.


621
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,070
What’s more,


622
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,310
you promised to make barbecue to me.


623
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,830
Or


624
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,950
I won’t help you to revenge.


625
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,190
Liu Mubai?


626
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,400
Come in.


627
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,590
You knew it’s me?


628
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,680
What’s the matter?


629
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,470
I’ll go ahead.


630
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,470
Since the battle between Mu and Liu,


631
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,830
the world suffered.


632
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:40,880
And my territory lost a lot.


633
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,470
There is not much left.


634
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,160
Now Evil Deity is coveting the world,


635
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,800
and Black Dragon is surrounding North Sect.


636
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:47,800
The world is in trouble.


637
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,070
However,


638
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,560
there is no one


639
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:51,920
who can stop Evil Deity.


640
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,310
I want to stop him,


641
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,920
revive Liu Territory


642
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,310
and live in peace.


643
00:33:59,190 --> 00:33:59,920
So,


644
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,230
I want


645
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,350
you to


646
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:03,800
do me a favor.


647
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,760
Me?


648
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:13,600
I want to borrow


649
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,040
Sumeru Pillar from you.


650
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,560
You can leave now.


651
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,800
Mubai,


652
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,280
eyes can’t lie.


653
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,040
You said you want to revive Liu Territory


654
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,040
and live in peace,


655
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,520
but all I can see from your eyes


656
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,389
is only hatred.


657
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,150
With the lessons drawn from Black Dragon’s mistakes,


658
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,520
I will never give the Sumeru Pillar


659
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,600
to someone who is full of grudges.


660
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,840
After I rebuild Liu Territory,


661
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,670
I will protect the world.


662
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,190
Protect the world?


663
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,600
Easier said than done.


664
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,670
You think only power is enough to do that?


665
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,909
To me,


666
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,800
the most important thing


667
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,469
is to have a kind heart.


668
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,520
Then who


669
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:05,040
do you think can protect the world?


670
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,000
Mu Chen?


671
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:06,840
Enough.


672
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,000
These questions are meaningless.


673
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,120
You can go now.


674
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,950
Lord Bai is in the coffin.


675
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,280
Young Master,


676
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,800
please restrain your grief.


677
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,280
What’s the matter?


678
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,150
When I checked Lord Bai’s body,


679
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,870
I found a bruise on his wrist.


680
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,280
It’s not appropriate for me


681
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,430
to say much about the situation then.


682
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,430
But if Lord Bai


683
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,390
was really killed by his own power,


684
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,190
only his meridian vessel and viscera would get hurt.


685
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,840
Why is there a bruise?


686
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,670
And it doesn’t


687
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:51,470
look like a normal fall injury.


688
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,320
So, it’s very suspicious.


689
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,280
That’s right.


690
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,230
I saw it as well.


691
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,190
But because it’s slight,


692
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:00,800
I didn’t care much about it.


693
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:01,840
You


694
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,150
want to open the coffin to check?


695
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,710
We can only


696
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,520
know the truth by that and checking


697
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,150
his meridian vessel with power.


698
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:10,910
Bai Tong,


699
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,520
we are really sorry


700
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,710
for your father’s death.


701
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,470
But he couldn’t have died without any reason.


702
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:19,120
So I need your permission.


703
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,560
Because I know


704
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,670
you want to know the truth


705
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:22,840
more than anyone else.


706
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:46,520
There is really a bruise.


707
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,430
I didn’t see it wrong.


708
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,870
The bruise must


709
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,190
be caused by an external force.


710
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,280
And it can’t be a normal magic power.


711
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,390
Lord Bai is murdered.


712
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,560
It seemed that the murderer had done his best


713
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:00,560
to erase the traces of fight from my father.


714
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:01,600
Mu Chen,


715
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:03,600
thanks to your careful observation.


716
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:04,870
Let me check his meridian vessel.


717
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,910
It’s not a magic power.


718
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,230
It’s an evil power!


719
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,670
Liu Mubai lied!


720
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,870
Don't jump to conclusions yet.


721
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,630
Let's ask him face to face.


722
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:23,600
Yes.


723
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,910
We’d better ask him about this first.


724
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,520
Mu Chen,


725
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,390
Liu Mubai is your friend, right?


726
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,710
Bai Tong,


727
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,230
I also want to know


728
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,760
the truth like you.


729
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,430
Mu Chen,


730
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:39,000
do you really suspect Liu Mubai?


731
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:39,840
I said that


732
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,670
I just want to know the truth.


733
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,190
It’s the direction of Lord White Dragon!


734
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,190
Liu Mubai!


735
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,560
I didn't expect you


736
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,630
to be so unscrupulous in order to


737
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,320
get Sumeru Pillar.


738
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,150
Liu Mubai! What are you doing?


739
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,390
Are you insane?


740
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,190
White Dragon,


741
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,630
you old fogey.


742
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,840
I begged you sincerely.


743
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,080
But you forced me to do this.


744
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,040
Liu Mubai! Wake up!


745
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,520
Do you know what you are doing?


746
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:20,630
Idiots.


747
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,870
If you surrender now,


748
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,190
maybe I’ll spare your lives for


749
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,560
the old times’ sake.


750
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,560
You should pay for what you did.


751
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,470
Liu Mubai,


752
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,560
I will revenge for my father!


753
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,520
Just you?


754
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,190
Don’t move!


755
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,000
I have words to say to him.


756
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,950
Power of Whisper?


757
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,080
Liu Mubai,


758
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,150
you should explain it.


759
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,470
Explain?


760
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:54,600
Power of Whisper has made me so strong now.


761
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,840
Why bother to explain?


762
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,840
Are you really the Liu Mubai I know?


763
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,910
The one who is always righteous


764
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,710
and would be the first one


765
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,430
to stand out to fight against Evil Deity.


766
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,910
I used to be.


767
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,630
But now I think


768
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,520
I was so stupid before.


769
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,910
My family has


770
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,630
experienced wars.


771
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,910
Now I’m the only one left.


772
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,950
What’s sadder is that


773
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,150
we are only the victims


774
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,600
of your fight against the Evil Deity.


775
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:31,390
Mu Chen,


776
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,630
you became the hero.


777
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,120
But I


778
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,910
became the one


779
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,800
everyone pities.


780
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,910
Tell me,


781
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,120
is it fair?


782
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,710
This shouldn’t be your reason to betray!


783
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,910
Liu Mubai,


784
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,470
your choice now


785
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,800
defiles the sacrifice of your family.


786
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:51,670
Betray?


787
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,630
You used me,


788
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,760
and I lost all my family.


789
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,430
You never trusted me


790
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,600
from beginning to end.


791
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,000
When I was falsely accused


792
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,760
by He Yao for our school,


793
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,710
did any one of you ever defend me?


794
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,870
Did any one of you ever


795
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,710
tell me that you are in White Horse City?


796
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,710
You pretend to trust me,


797
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,390
but you're just trying to use me.


798
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,320
Speaking of betrayal,


799
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:19,280
all of you betrayed me!


800
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,150
Liu Mubai,


801
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,800
I always trust you.


802
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,280
But I didn’t expect…


803
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:36,910
Mu Chen!


804
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,120
You had no power before,


805
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:42,150
but you get everyone’s recognition.


806
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,000
You took everything


807
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,760
that was supposed to be mine.


808
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,710
Now it’s time to give it back to me.


809
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,520
Let me tell you,


810
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,120
I will not relent.


811
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,190
And I won’t give anyone


812
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,280
the chance to use me.


813
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:56,280
I will only get more powerful.


814
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,560
Only I


815
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,230
will be the master in the end.


816
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,470
Mubai,


817
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,280
I always regard you and Qingshan


818
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,560
as my best friends.


819
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,670
Everyone takes you as the hero.


820
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,120
Don’t you remember any of it?
