1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available.]


2
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,560
What does that mean?


3
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,760
The beasts in the Fairyland


4
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,400
will be snakes.


5
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,960
Qian’er,


6
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,520
why don’t you


7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,880
give up this exam?


8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,680
Even you dare to go.


9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,120
What...


10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,320
What should I be afraid of?


11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,680
You’re afraid of snakes, my dear.


12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,080
You can’t even walk


13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,920
when you see snakes.


14
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,800
Besides, I’m prepared this time.


15
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,360
What is it?


16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,560
It’s something that repels snakes.


17
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,320
Something that repels snakes?


18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,400
Let me have a look.


19
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:02,920
Don’t worry.


20
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,870
I’ll protect you.


21
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,880
Take care of yourself first.


22
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,240
Alright.


23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,520
Go in the transmitting circle, please.


24
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,360
You used your whip just in time.


25
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,680
If it hadn’t been for you,


26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,520
I guess


27
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,940
we wouldn’t have passed the snakes trap.


28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,479
Stop it.


29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,440
Didn’t you see that


30
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,800
I was protecting myself?


31
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,440
Don’t worry.


32
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,520
I’ll go ahead.


33
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,400
If there’s danger, I’ll run into it first.


34
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,440
Can you stop saying things like that?


35
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,280
It’s like we’re forcing you to run into danger.


36
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:47,800
I don’t want you to get hurt.


37
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,960
I mean,


38
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,080
if you’re hurt,


39
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,600
you can’t protect us then, can you?


40
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:55,960
Don’t worry.


41
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,759
I won’t be hurt.


42
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,800
Miss Luo Li is also here.


43
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,640
Miss Luo Li,


44
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,080
listen,


45
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,400
you don’t have to stare at me.


46
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,160
We’re in the Fairyland.


47
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,880
I can’t escape even if I want to.


48
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,480
Don’t be fierce.


49
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,280
The blood of beasts.


50
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,800
Use it to protect yourself.


51
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,360
Those snakes love its smell the most.


52
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,240
You know that.


53
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,600
Use it to protect myself?


54
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,900
You want to kill me, don’t you?


55
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,240
That depends on where you scatter it.


56
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:36,840
Liu Mubai,


57
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,600
where are you taking us?


58
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,280
There are many magic plants ahead.


59
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,480
I want to see if there’s something that repels snakes.


60
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,360
Be patient.


61
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,960
Can’t you find it and take it back?


62
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,560
Don’t make us run after you.


63
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,440
We’re not far from the den of


64
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,000
Python Tunshan now.


65
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,760
It’s dangerous here,


66
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,800
so I can’t let you wait for me here.


67
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,840
Yes. Yes. Yes.


68
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,680
We’ve got to follow him.


69
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,760
Only then can we...


70
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,600
be safe.


71
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,960
I can’t walk anymore.


72
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,200
Let’s take a break here.


73
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,120
Mu Chen.


74
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:23,880
Give it to Qian’er.


75
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,120
You’re so considerate, Mubai.


76
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,680
How do you know I’m thirsty?


77
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,960
I’ll check if there are more fruits ahead.


78
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,120
I think he’s quite nice.


79
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,040
What has it got to do


80
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,520
with you whether he’s nice?


81
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,320
I know what you’re thinking about.


82
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,960
Although he seems


83
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,120
unconcerned,


84
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,800
he’s absolutely different from his dad.


85
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,000
He’s a gentleman.


86
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
I just don’t like that.


87
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,840
He’s always preaching at me.


88
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,600
He’s so nice to me


89
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,269
because we’re engaged


90
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,800
and he must be like that.


91
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:51,820
The Great Ruler


92
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,780
Episode 2


93
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,920
I’ve waited for four hours.


94
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,000
Where’s Mo?


95
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,440
You’ve waited for such a long time.


96
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,240
Why don’t you wait a little longer?


97
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,120
Are you Xue Shi of Xue God Clan?


98
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,480
What can I do for you?


99
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,640
President,


100
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,960
I’ll come straight to the point.


101
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,800
We suspect that the fiancee of our chief, Luo Li,


102
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:45,680
is hiding at Beiling School.


103
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,560
I hope you’ll give her back to us.


104
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,040
If you think it’s troublesome,


105
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,000
I can do it myself.


106
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,640
That’s weird.


107
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,820
Beiling School


108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,920
is always a place for humans to practice magic power.


109
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,560
Dude,


110
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,440
when have we


111
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
offered to hide someone?


112
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,360
President,


113
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,520
our clans never


114
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,760
interfere in one another’s affairs.


115
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,120
It’s our internal affair.


116
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,960
You’d better not meddle in it.


117
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,160
You’re right.


118
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,320
It’s your internal affair.


119
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,840
Of course we shouldn’t meddle in it.


120
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:24,960
But if


121
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,160
it concerns


122
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,240
the teachers and students of Beiling School,


123
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,120
that will be my business,


124
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,400
right?


125
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,520
You mean you won’t give her to us?


126
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,880
I want to


127
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,320
but I can’t.


128
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:46,920
President,


129
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,480
as you said just now,


130
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,600
your duty is to protect


131
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,560
the safety of your teachers and students.


132
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,480
But now you’re going to


133
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,400
sacrifice all of them just because of her.


134
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,720
Is it worth it?


135
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,760
Are you threatening us?


136
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,560
Absolutely not.


137
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,640
I’m just advising you to


138
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,120
think twice about it.


139
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,400
I will


140
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,030
be off.


141
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,040
Check this out.


142
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,320
What is it?


143
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,480
It’s a tooth of some beast.


144
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,660
It’s so big.


145
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,040
Can it be the tooth of a snake?


146
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,520
Qian’er,


147
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,720
take them back.


148
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,960
I’ll check places around again.


149
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,540
See?


150
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,660
He’s doing it again.


151
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,540
He cares about you.


152
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,400
Do you want him to hit you and scold you every day?


153
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,160
Qian’er,


154
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,040
watch out!


155
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,880
My goodness,


156
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,480
there are so many snakes here.


157
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,960
They’re hard to deal with.


158
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,720
Be careful.


159
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,280
Stay close to each other.


160
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,200
Are they all running away?


161
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,960
Yes, they are.


162
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,660
Great.


163
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,520
Looks like we’re safe now.


164
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,480
Generally speaking,


165
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,040
these snakes won’t stop chasing their prey.


166
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,960
Why did they retreat today?


167
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:22,720
Have...


168
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,240
Have I been sitting on its back just now?


169
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,400
I told you


170
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,000
they wouldn’t run away so easily.


171
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,600
Turns out their ancestor is here.


172
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,620
[Python Tunshan]


173
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,040
It’s Python Tunshan.


174
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,720
It ranks the eighty-sixth on the Record of Beasts.


175
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,120
Oh, no.


176
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,920
We’re doomed to death.


177
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,360
Mubai,


178
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,480
wait.


179
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,480
Mu Chen.


180
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,360
Let me handle it this time.


181
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,540
The boss of snakes!


182
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,160
Mu Chen!


183
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,760
Python Tunshan,


184
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,840
come over here!


185
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,200
Mu Chen,


186
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,000
you can’t kill it by yourself.


187
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:14,960
Are you OK?


188
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,240
Python Tunshan,


189
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,520
chase me!


190
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,640
Python Tunshan,


191
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,720
chase me.


192
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,840
Come and catch me.


193
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,360
Come. Come.


194
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,640
Come and catch me.


195
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,400
Python Tunshan,


196
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,320
why...


197
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,880
why did you keep chasing me?


198
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,280
I’ve given you half of the blood


199
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:13,920
and my clothes.


200
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,320
Can’t you...


201
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,840
Can’t you change your target?


202
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,540
Never mind.


203
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,280
Swallow me if you like.


204
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,080
Mu Chen.


205
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,200
Luo...


206
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,120
Luo Li?


207
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,240
My coin.


208
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,280
Your coin?


209
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,040
Can’t you say something else?


210
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,400
You saved me just now.


211
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,840
By right,


212
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,920
my life is yours.


213
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,320
But I really didn’t


214
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,480
take your coin.


215
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,920
I never lie


216
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,040
and heaven can prove it.


217
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,480
If you don’t believe me,


218
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,160
just take my life.


219
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,360
Without it,


220
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,960
I can’t find Jiuyou Bird.


221
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,480
Jiuyou Bird.


222
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,920
Is it that magic beast?


223
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,120
Luo Li,


224
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,720
although I have no idea


225
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,760
where that bird is.


226
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,160
But now that I lost


227
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:09,960
your coin,


228
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,880
I’ll definitely find it for you.


229
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,520
You can’t.


230
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,240
If I can’t find it here,


231
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,400
we’ll search Beiling School.


232
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,240
If we can’t find it there,


233
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,440
we’ll search the Five Sets.


234
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,840
If we still can’t find it,


235
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,160
I’ll search the whole world with you.


236
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,800
I will find it.


237
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,880
Are you OK?


238
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,600
Yes.


239
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,480
Only my clothes were torn.


240
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,480
How about Qian’er and Mubai?


241
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,480
Are they OK?


242
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,200
They’re behind us.


243
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,080
It’s a good thing they’re OK.


244
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,880
Miss Luo Li,


245
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,800
you were really amazing just now.


246
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,080
You were simply a goddess coming down to earth.


247
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,280
I’ve never seen anyone


248
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,400
doing things like that.


249
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,240
Why don’t you


250
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,440
accept me as your student?


251
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,360
I don’t have a teacher, anyway.


252
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,000
I will study hard.


253
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:05,800
No.


254
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,080
I don’t teach.


255
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,120
Mo,


256
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,720
what does Xue God Clan plague Luo Li for?


257
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,920
You didn’t know.


258
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,640
The deities’ marriages
are different from those of humans.


259
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,880
They’ll combine the couple’s blood.


260
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,120
Luo Li has the purest blood of Luo God Clan.


261
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,960
Certainly Xue God Clan will plague her.


262
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,080
Of course


263
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,560
it’s also possible that


264
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,040
Xue Lingzi is in love with her.


265
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,160
Now no one at the school


266
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,720
knows who Luo Li is.


267
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:44,920
That doesn’t matter.


268
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,520
But I worry they will


269
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,160
harm other students on the sly.


270
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,000
I’m afraid


271
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,120
Luo Li can’t stay here any longer.


272
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,480
But if she’s not here,


273
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,640
we won’t be able to protect her.


274
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,600
How about sending her to Nine Territories?


275
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,000
Nine Territories?


276
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,320
I only trust Mu Feng in Nine Territories.


277
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,320
We can send Luo Li


278
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,640
to his place.


279
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,000
But...


280
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,720
What are you worried about?


281
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,800
It’s all because of


282
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,960
that brat, Mu Chen.


283
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,840
He’s the naughtiest at Beiling School.


284
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,840
If we send her to the Mu Territory,


285
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,600
won’t we make trouble for Mu Feng?


286
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,920
But except that,


287
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,480
there’s nothing we can do.


288
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,560
Fine.


289
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,440
I’ll go and tell Mu Feng.


290
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,800
We’ll send Luo Li there.


291
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,560
OK.


292
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,240
Tear mine.


293
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,080
Alright,


294
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,520
don’t be so talkative.


295
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,920
Take your hand off.


296
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,640
You look


297
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,960
beautiful in this dress.


298
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,880
It’s dirty.


299
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,160
How can I look beautiful?


300
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,600
OK.


301
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,340
How are you feeling now?


302
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,000
We’ve got to look for Mu Chen and Luo Li now.


303
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,200
How are you?


304
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:48,880
I’m OK.


305
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,340
Fine.


306
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,100
I’ll hold you.


307
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,880
Tianling Lotus.


308
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,100
It’s the plant Mubai talked about.


309
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,560
It’s empty.


310
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,800
There’s a cave ahead.


311
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,080
Let’s go in.


312
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,720
There’s no smell of blood here.


313
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,080
We should be safe here.


314
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,320
Are you OK?


315
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,280
Yes.


316
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,200
Who killed the python?


317
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,680
Who else can it be?


318
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,080
It can’t be me, anyway.


319
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,080
Luo Li,


320
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,880
you killed Python Tunshan by yourself?


321
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,160
Have you reached the Deity Level?


322
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,080
Mubai,


323
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,480
leave that boss of snakes.


324
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:18,920
Look at this.


325
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,920
Why would this happen?


326
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,840
Its exterior is intact


327
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,400
but it’s empty


328
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,960
without any power


329
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,920
it breaks once being touched.


330
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,840
This place is full of magic power


331
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,280
and nourishes so many plants.


332
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,280
It shouldn’t like this.


333
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,920
It’s not a part of the exam, is it?


334
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,400
Of course not.


335
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,480
These plants are even more valuable than me.


336
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,720
How could they possibly damage so many of them?


337
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,480
It’s not empty.


338
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,320
That’s to say


339
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,480
only plants that have magic power


340
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,640
are affected.


341
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,600
This is Python Tunshan’s den.


342
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,320
I never hear it has this kind of ability.


343
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,760
Who can it be, then?


344
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,920
Don’t you want to know


345
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,600
what absorbed


346
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,640
the power of these plants?


347
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,880
Their power is weak.


348
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,560
We can’t find that out.


349
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,240
What do we do?


350
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,920
I have an idea.


351
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,240
But there’s no way I can do it alone.


352
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,100
You want me to help you?


353
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,440
Except me, you’re the only person


354
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,040
who can use magic circles here.


355
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,480
What circle is this?


356
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,840
It’s a Power-detecting Circle.


357
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,340
I read it on an old book that


358
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,100
it can detect movements of magic power,


359
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,720
but few people know


360
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,880
its efficacy.


361
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,400
And it’s extremely complicated.


362
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,880
How did you learn it?


363
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,100
I don’t have magic power


364
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,960
so I could only work on something else.


365
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,720
Otherwise,


366
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,160
how can I deal with your cousin and the others?


367
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,340
Come on.


368
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,340
He remembered it because


369
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,040
he bunked off and was asked to


370
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,640
draw it too many times.


371
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,280
I just found that


372
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,600
you started to be partial to Mubai.


373
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,480
I...


374
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:30,560
OK.


375
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,640
I’ll try.


376
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,440
Can you do it or not?


377
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,480
It’s indeed a bit complicated.


378
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,840
I’ll try again.


379
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,320
OK.


380
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,000
They’re going that way.


381
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,480
The Lake of Dragon?


382
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,880
Isn’t it the place where that auspicious eye is?


383
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,040
It’s also the Black Dragon’s dwelling.


384
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,640
He has always been respected by us.


385
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,440
He’s respected by us.


386
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,880
That doesn’t mean he’s a good man.


387
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,280
Dad,


388
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,560
I have told you.


389
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,260
[Ten years ago]


390
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,620
[Young Mu Chen]


391
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,000
I saw the Black Dragon fighting the White Dragon.


392
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:43,680
The White Dragon said


393
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,720
the Black Dragon killed many innocent people.


394
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,760
Thank you.


395
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,720
You should have found it.


396
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,760
The power of the Lake of Dragon


397
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,800
isn’t from heaven and earth.


398
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,240
There’s plenty of power now.


399
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,280
If he just wants to gather it,


400
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,920
he doesn’t need to ruin living things at all.


401
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,440
This is an important matter.


402
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,440
Let’s go home now and tell our fathers.


403
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,320
We’re not bunking off, are we?


404
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,000
Of course not.


405
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:23,920
We have to go at once.


406
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,680
We?


407
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,000
Where are you going?


408
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,240
I’ll go back to the Mu Territory with you


409
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,100
and tell Mr. Mu.


410
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,640
My dad believes you, anyway.


411
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,720
What about us?


412
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,100
You and Luo Li will go back
and tell Mr. Mo and the others.


413
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,520
What are you doing?


414
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,920
I want to show it to my dad.


415
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,480
Mu Chen saw the power of all these plants


416
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,280
moving to the Lake of Dragon


417
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,400
with a Power-detecting Circle.


418
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,100
So we guess


419
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,400
the abundant power around that Lake


420
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,400
is possibly from other places.


421
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,720
If it goes on like this,


422
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,560
the whole Beiling will be affected.


423
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,720
I’m afraid what I saw ten years ago
is going to come true.


424
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,800
Are you sure you saw the power


425
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,720
moving to the Lake of Dragon?


426
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,480
Yes, I am.


427
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,000
We all saw it.


428
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,640
Wait.


429
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,480
What did you see ten years ago?


430
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,920
Ten years ago,


431
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,520
I saw the Black Dragon


432
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,400
hurt the White Dragon


433
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,600
in the Dragon Palace.


434
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,340
The Black Dragon is wicked.


435
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,920
The thing he’s guarding


436
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,320
mustn’t be something good.


437
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,800
It concerns an old legend.


438
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,340
It’s normal that you didn’t think of it.


439
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,720
Have you heard of a ballad?


440
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,640
When the nine eyes gather,


441
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,960
the Evil Deity will appear.


442
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,840
Do you mean


443
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,320
the eye in the Lake is the Evil Deity’s eye?


444
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,680
At first,


445
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,920
I was just guessing.


446
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,680
You’ve already seen


447
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,200
the mighty force of the eye in the Lake.


448
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:23,660
[Lake of Dragon]


449
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,100
Though I have bounded the center of the circle,


450
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,320
more protection is needed.


451
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,640
Sir,


452
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,880
there’s something I don’t know if I should say.


453
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,760
Go on, please.


454
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,840
Our magic power all comes from heaven and earth.


455
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,720
We feel the magic air,


456
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:43,960
take it in


457
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,320
and turn it into magic power.


458
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,200
Humans,


459
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,000
deities and dragons


460
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,000
all do it like that.


461
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,800
Although the eye in the Lake


462
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,520
has tremendous power,


463
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,280
we have no idea


464
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,040
where it comes from


465
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,760
and whether it’ll really benefit us.


466
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,400
In that case,


467
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,640
why don’t you give it a try?


468
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,280
OK.


469
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,100
Are you still in any doubt?


470
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,800
Everyone,


471
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,680
please go to the Dragon Palace with me.


472
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,200
Considering what’s going on,


473
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,520
I’m afraid I was right.


474
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,960
Please make an alliance with the Liu Territory


475
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,640
to deal with this disaster.


476
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,560
I want to.


477
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,160
But there’s deep enmity between me and your dad.


478
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,600
I’m afraid he’ll refuse.


479
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,960
You should put aside personal hatred


480
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,340
in front of crises.


481
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,840
I will try to dissolve it


482
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,280
to the best of my ability.


483
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,640
Mubai,


484
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,440
I trust you.


485
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,920
But will your dad


486
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,200
believe you?


487
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:56,840
Stop it.


488
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,920
The alliance between the Liu and Mu territories


489
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
is the best solution now.


490
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,320
Although there’s little hope,


491
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,400
I’m willing to fight hard.


492
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,080
Mubai,


493
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,320
let’s go to the Liu Territory right now.


494
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:15,680
OK.


495
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,400
Dad,


496
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,100
Mr. Liu is especially wary of you.


497
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,520
Let me go instead.


498
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,680
I’m eloquent.


499
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,680
Chen,


500
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,920
go back to Beiling School.


501
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,000
The Black Dragon has numerous informants.


502
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,760
We mustn’t give this matter away


503
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,200
and we need to do things in secret.


504
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,200
Besides, if you and Mubai are out too long,


505
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,280
you’ll definitely arouse suspicions.


506
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,280
Mubai,


507
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,960
I have to disguise myself


508
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,000
before we go.


509
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:40,600
Mubai,


510
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,680
you’ll ensure my dad’s safety, then.


511
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,600
Safety first.


512
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,560
Don’t worry.


513
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,260
[Liu Territory]


514
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,500
[Liu Qingtain, Ruler of Liu Territory]


515
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:09,480
Father.


516
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,680
Mubai,


517
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,120
why are you back?


518
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,520
I brought a guest for you.


519
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,280
Mr. Liu,


520
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,160
ever since we parted by the Lake of Dragon,


521
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,200
we haven’t seen each other for ten years.


522
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,160
As I said just now,


523
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,140
[Ten years ago]


524
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,120
this place needs protection.


525
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,280
Which one of you is interested?


526
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,320
As you’ve seen just now,


527
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,480
the power in the Lake is surging.


528
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,360
The circle beside the lake


529
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,040
is set for its protector.


530
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,120
If you practice in it,


531
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,440
it’ll do you lots of good.


532
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,600
Sir,


533
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,280
I’m willing to undertake the task.


534
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,880
Good.


535
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,800
You are indeed a smart man.


536
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,440
Does anyone have a problem with it?


537
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,480
The Mu Territory


538
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,280
is willing to guard the Lake of Dragon, too.


539
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,400
The Lake of Dragon absorbs power.


540
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,120
Mr. Mu,


541
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,040
have you gone gaga?


542
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,960
Did you forget ten years ago,


543
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,560
you and I competed for it?


544
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,440
Father,


545
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,920
I saw a magic plant


546
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,240
becoming smoke in my hand.


547
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,440
Mubai,


548
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,680
you’re too kind


549
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,200
and easily made use of.


550
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,440
It’s natural that plants wither.


551
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,080
Even if their power is absorbed,


552
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,280
that’s because they’re dead


553
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,040
and then the Lake of Dragon


554
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,000
absorbs the residual power.


555
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,280
Isn’t that reasonable?


556
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,400
Mr. Liu,


557
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,920
have you considered the reason


558
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,280
why the Black Dragon shared with us


559
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,920
when he had always despised humans?


560
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,640
Even if he really wanted to benefit mankind,


561
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,760
why did he bound it


562
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,200
and behave so sneakily?


563
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,440
I know there are frictions between us.


564
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,360
But this time


565
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,800
the safety of the whole Beiling is at stake.


566
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,920
When the skin is gone,


567
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,640
what can the hair attach itself to?


568
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,880
At that time, what’s the point of


569
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,440
the struggle between us?


570
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,080
What are you going to do, then?


571
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,800
We can’t go to war over this matter.


572
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,600
We need to keep it secret


573
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,360
and find out whether the eye in the Lake of Dragon


574
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,720
is absorbing power


575
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,240
from us and those plants.


576
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,880
If as you said,


577
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,000
the power in Beiling is being exhausted,


578
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,760
what should we do?


579
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,200
We’ll join forces


580
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,880
to destroy it.


581
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,280
Mr. Mu,


582
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,960
don’t underestimate that Black Dragon.


583
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,200
You think the two of us


584
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,880
can defeat him?


585
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,360
Don’t worry, Mr. Liu.


586
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,320
I can handle him.


587
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,960
Are you telling the truth?


588
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,880
I’m not holding it back deliberately.


589
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,240
It’s not completed yet.


590
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,200
Over the last ten years, we’ve been


591
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,920
doing it for this disaster.


592
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,480
On no account


593
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,400
will I trifle with lives of people in Beiling.


594
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,480
You’re accomplished at circles.


595
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,120
OK.


596
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,280
In that case,


597
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,760
I agree.


598
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:00,960
Let’s meet


599
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,360
by the Lake of Dragon.


600
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,360
Goodbye.


601
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,080
See you.


602
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,560
Father,


603
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,640
you put your enmity aside for the whole situation.


604
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,080
I deeply admire you.


605
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,520
Mubai,


606
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,160
I hope you will


607
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,760
focus on your study


608
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,560
and stay out of things like this.


609
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,000
You’re the young master of the Liu Territory


610
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,200
and you’ll be its ruler in the future.


611
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,120
What’s the most important to you


612
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,000
is to protect the safety and interest
of the Liu territory


613
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,920
instead of the whole Beiling.


614
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,680
Understand?


615
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,360
Father.


616
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,000
Alright.


617
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,880
Go back to Beiling School.


618
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,240
We’ll talk another time.


619
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,160
Go.


620
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,670
Ten years.


621
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,120
You prepared for so many years.


622
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,360
Is it really for the Lake of Dragon


623
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:27,280
instead of the Liu Territory?


624
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,280
A magic circle.


625
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,920
I don’t have magic power,


626
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,150
so I’ve got to


627
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,520
study hard on something else.


628
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,670
Any news


629
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,080
on those magic plants?


630
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,120
Not yet.


631
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,320
But now that he wants to absorb all of the power,


632
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,840
we’ll just need to protect it.


633
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,520
Will that work?


634
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,320
There are countless magic circles in the world.


635
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,640
Now that there’s a way to suck away the power,


636
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:04,760
I believe


637
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,200
there’s also a way to protect it.


638
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,640
You don’t have magic power.


639
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,040
Good.


640
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,400
Isn’t that too hurtful?


641
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,480
You’re a good person.


642
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,120
What did you say?


643
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:26,840
Say it again.


644
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,160
Are you praising me?


645
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,680
That’s quite surprising.


646
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,320
The Lake of Dragon


647
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,400
shouldn’t have been like that.


648
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,400
Things there are not clear yet.


649
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,520
Have you been to the Lake of Dragon?


650
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,800
I’ve been there


651
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:51,840
long ago.


652
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,040
This matter is not only
the business of the Dragon Palace.


653
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,700
That place gathers power several times


654
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,880
as much as the Power-gathering Circle of Beiling School


655
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,640
so it’s a good place for people to practice in.


656
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,480
We’re just guessing that


657
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,700
it absorbs power.


658
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,080
You mustn’t tell anyone.


659
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,880
Power-gathering Circle?


660
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,520
You don’t know what it is?


661
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:13,760
A Power-gathering Circle


662
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,280
is the commonest magic circle.


663
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,080
People will practice magic power in


664
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,760
Power-gathering Circles if they can.


665
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,160
Because the effect will multiply there.


666
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,280
You still don’t get it?


667
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,040
How about this?


668
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,120
I’ll take you to


669
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,360
the Power-gathering Circle early in the morning.


670
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,480
That’s settled, then?


671
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,360
Qian’er,


672
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,360
what are you doing here?


673
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,120
Can’t I read books here as well?


674
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,160
Is your wound OK now?


675
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,220
Yes.


676
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,560
By the way,


677
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,680
I want to give this to you.


678
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,880
What is it?


679
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,960
It’s for your self-protection.


680
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:08,700
From now on,


681
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,080
you don’t have to be afraid of snakes.


682
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,200
No.


683
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,120
Can you stop giving me anything?


684
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,520
You don’t have that gift.


685
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,200
Actually I also have something for you.


686
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,560
Take your hand off.


687
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,000
You did it yourself?


688
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,800
How could I do it myself?


689
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,880
It’s made by those workers at my house.


690
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,760
I’ll accept it.


691
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,280
Save the snake repellent for yourself.


692
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,220
I’ve got you.


693
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,880
What do I need it for?


694
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,520
Have you decided which sect you’re going to?


695
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,120
I’m in the Rotating Level now


696
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:21,200
so probably I’ll go to Sky Sect


697
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,000
or Sage Sect.


698
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:23,960
Oh, yes.


699
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,220
I hear you haven’t decided yet.


700
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,320
You’re the best of Beiling School.


701
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,600
What are you hesitate about?


702
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,920
You’re certain to go to North Sect, aren’t you?


703
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,680
I don’t want to go there.


704
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,400
If you don’t go there,


705
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,220
where do you want to go?


706
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,220
I haven’t decided yet.


707
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:53,840
I will be


708
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,160
where you are.


709
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,080
What...


710
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,840
What has that got to do with you?


711
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,700
I’ll go to Phoenix Sect.


712
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:11,880
How can you go with me, then?


713
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,520
That’s alright.


714
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,400
The Five Sects are so close to each other.


715
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,280
I can go to


716
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,600
see you every day.


717
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,680
Where are you going?


718
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,000
I’m going to practice in the Power-gathering Circle.


719
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,620
[Power-gathering Circle]


720
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,040
Wake up.


721
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,880
Can I help you?


722
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,440
You don’t have magic power


723
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,680
and you slept here.


724
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,220
You’re really a good-for-nothing.


725
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:48,700
Liu Yang,


726
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:49,640
don’t go too far.


727
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,560
Mu Chen,


728
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,320
I have no right to interfere


729
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,160
whether you sleep or practice.


730
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,960
But you took seats for two.


731
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,480
Aren’t you wasting our resources?


732
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,480
Can you vacate one for us?


733
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,560
Liu Mubai,


734
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,840
this seat is taken today.


735
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,400
Find somewhere else for yourselves.


736
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,640
Luo Li,


737
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,480
come here quickly.


738
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,800
I came before 5 a.m.


739
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,360
to take a good seat for you.


740
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,920
Is this the place where you practice?


741
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,920
They practice here.


742
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,680
I don’t have magic power


743
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:33,700
so


744
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,880
I can only watch.
