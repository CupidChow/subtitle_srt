
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available.]



00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,030
Why are you so impulsive?



00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,520
I wanted



00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,760
to hold the test secretly before.



00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,760
Once you become the Saintess,



00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,390
they will have nothing to say.



00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,520
And our people can fight



00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:20,920
together with you.



00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:21,310
But…



00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,200
But now you made a deal with them.



00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,760
Have you thought about



00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,680
what to do



00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,950
if you really fail?



00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:32,880
Grandpa.



00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,720
There are many rumors in our clan.



00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,560
Disunity



00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,200
is much scarier than Xue God Clan.



00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,200
The crisis can only be solved by



00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:41,910
the unity and



00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,110
struggle of the whole clan.



00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,840
We shouldn’t hold the test secretly.



00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,200
The best way to unite our people



00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,470
is to do it publicly and succeed.



00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,880
Luo Li,



00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,680
you really have grown up.



00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:37,380
The Great Ruler



00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,260
Episode 31



00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,470
Father.



00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,880
Father!



00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:48,880
Father!



00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:50,880
Father!



00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,030
Father!



00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,630
Mubai.



00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,360
Mubai.



00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,600
Wake up.



00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,440
Qian’er.



00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,470
Qian’er.



00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,720
Qian’er. Where are you?



00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,750
I’m here.



00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,270
I’m here.



00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,000
Qian’er.



00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,110
Mubai.



00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:08,670
Sorry.



00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,190
Sorry.



00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,470
It’s okay.



00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,880
Sorry.



00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,670
It’s okay.



00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:16,750
Sorry.



00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,829
Everything will be all right.



00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,880
Thank you.



00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:00,910
Let me comb your hair.



00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,040
Qian’er.



00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,000
Sorry.



00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,040
Yes.



00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,350
You should be.



00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,880
I end up like this



00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,040
because of you.



00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,070
Since you caused all this,



00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,920
shouldn’t you



00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,390
take the responsibility for me?



00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,320
Qian’er.



00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,390
Marry me.



00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,160
Let me compensate you



00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,320
with the rest of my life.



00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,670
Silly man.



00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,830
We’ve been engaged.



00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,320
You’re already my husband.



00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,950
But we haven’t had a wedding yet.



00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,950
Luckily, someone told me



00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,230
Qian’er turned up in Liu Territory.



00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,920
Or we wouldn’t have found her.



00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,950
Are you really not going to



00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,270
take her home?



00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,110
Even if you send men



00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,550
to buy all her medicinal materials,



00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,720
how much can she get?



00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,160
Don’t you know her?



00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,070
She would have come back if she wanted to.



00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,110
Anyway,



00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,350
I’m also responsible



00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,200
for the destruction of the Liu Territory.



00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,640
She doesn’t go home,



00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,640
because she doesn’t want Mubai to be sad.



00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,600
But…



00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,760
she’s suffering!



00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,920
I really feel…



00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,670
Listen.



00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,350
How happily Qian’er laughs!



00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,950
All right.



00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,760
Let’s go.



00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,000
Let’s go.



00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,880
From now on,



00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,950
we’re an ordinary couple,



00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,790
having nothing to do with the past.



00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,950
In the future,



00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,000
I’ll just live a peaceful life with you.



00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,200
I want nothing else,



00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,950
except that.



00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:31,350
Mu Chen.



00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,030
Look!



00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,000
We’re almost there.



00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,280
That’s the Land of Beasts,



00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,230
where the Phoenix Heritage lies.



00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,470
Why is it a forest?



00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,350
Shouldn’t it be a grassland?



00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,760
How do I know?



00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,400
I didn’t name it.



00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,320
It’s so big.



00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,230
When can we find the Phoenix Heritage?



00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,320
What a beautiful place!



00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,350
Totally different from where we were.



00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:25,590
In this place,



00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,470
you must be very cautious.



00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,030
What’s wrong?



00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,400
What have you found?



00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,910
Don’t you feel it?



00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,710
We’ve been walking so long,



00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,910
but not even a bird has flown by.



00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,710
That’s really abnormal.



00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,320
Let’s go.



00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,960
Since we’ve come,



00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,960
we must try, however dangerous it is.



00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,400
My Lady?



00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,080
My Lady, it’s been a while.



00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,470
What brings you here?



00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,280
My Lady.



00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,710
With all due respect,



00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,280
hearing that you’re back,



00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,710
our leader sent me



00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,760
to visit you



00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,470
and get you back for a couple of days.



00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,400
Please tell your leader



00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,280
that we haven’t acquiesced in the marriage yet.



00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,320
It’s too early



00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,030
to call her My Lady.



00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,760
Wait.



00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,000
What do you mean?



00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,200
Our Saintess



00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,350
isn’t some girl he can marry as he wishes.



00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,230
But…



00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,400
Elders, please think carefully



00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,790
about this.



00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,350
We don’t need to.



00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,640
On this,



00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,200
they agree with me.



00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,880
When they admit



00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,440
they agree with you,



00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:44,640
How dare you!



00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,350
they really do!



00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,110
So, elders.



00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,710
Do you really agree with him?



00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,840
That’s weird.



00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,880
Saintess of your clan is so noble



00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,280
and hard to get!



00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,030
But everyone, do you know?



00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,880
What did she do



00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,670
after she left



00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,470
Luo God Clan?



00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,320
First,



00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,590
we sent many envoys to her



00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,110
to express our good wills.



00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,110
But by now,



00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,910
they’ve been killed or wounded.



00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,320
No envoys are even killed in a war!



00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,520
I’ll let go of it.



00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,960
In Beiling,



00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,840
the noble, adorable and generous Saintess



00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,150
of your clan



00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,000
pledged to marry Young Master of the Mu Territory,



00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:40,910
Mu Chen,



00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,440
without parental permission.



00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,320
You don’t know?



00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,470
I thought you all knew it.



00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,590
What a responsible Saintess!



00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,350
No wonder you prefer to be ruined



00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,440
rather than marry her to our leader!



00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,520
But Leader Luo,



00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,320
the Xue God Clan



00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,280
will never let the marriage



00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,790
slip by!



00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,440
See you.



00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,880
Luo Li.



00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,150
Did he mean it?



00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:33,710
Qingya.



00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,520
Calm down!



00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,320
He was obviously



00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,590
driving a wedge between us!



00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,150
Don’t you know



00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,320
what girl Luo Li is?



00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,840
How could she



00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,320
violate the prohibition deliberately?



00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,670
In my opinion,



00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,520
we should tell the whole clan about this,



00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,550
so that they can judge.



00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,440
Luo Li.



00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,640
Can you explain to them?



00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,590
No. No. No.



00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,320
I don’t think it’s a good idea.



00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:09,080
Our clansmen have been dispirited.



00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,790
Xue God Clan cast a greedy eye on us.



00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,230
If we tell them,



00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,760
there’ll be great trouble.



00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,640
Leader.



00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,550
I think our priority



00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,470
is to complete the Luo Offering.



00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,590
Grandpa Qingya.



00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,110
Please trust me.



00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,790
I’m the Saintess of our clan.



00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,230
I will fulfil my duty!



00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,670
I can keep it secret for you.



00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,710
But…



00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,910
when the sacrifice ends,



00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,640
you must explain to me.



00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:51,910
Jiuyou.



00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,000
What’s going on with you and Bai Tong?



00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,400
Nothing.



00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,840
Come on.



00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,470
You flirted with each other.



00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,640
And I saw that!



00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,280
He confessed to me.



00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,200
He did?



00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:08,470
He said he liked me.



00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,280
What did you say?



00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,470
I didn’t agree to be with him.



00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,670
Why?



00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,230
Bai Tong is a good man!



00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,350
You two make a good match.



00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,030
But I don’t like him.



00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,000
I can’t just force myself.



00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,320
Jiuyou.



00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,030
Love grows



00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,640
when you stay together.



00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,520
Give him a chance.



00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,230
If a girl



00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,840
you don’t like confesses to you,



00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,400
will you agree?



00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,550
We’re different.



00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,030
I have the girl I like.



00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,200
But you don’t have one.



00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:37,960
Right?



00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,910
No, I don’t.



00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,710
Why does the mosquito only bite me,



00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,550
instead of you?



00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,880
You cheat!



00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,590
This is the dovetail leaf.



00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,790
It’s super toxic.



00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,440
But…



00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,520
it won’t harm anyone,



00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,200
when its sac is removed.



00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,790
Crush it



00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,030
and apply it to your body.



00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,440
No mosquitoes will bite you.



00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,760
Mu Chen?



00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:33,840
Bai Tong!



00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,080
Why are you coming?



00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,550
Didn’t I ask you not to come?



00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,910
But I’m worried about you.



00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,080
Did you see Mu Chen?



00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,670
No. I just arrived.



00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,440
Forget it.



00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,670
Let’s go find him!



00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,440
Go!



00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:06,560
Qian’er.



00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:11,640
You are?



00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,160
I’m passing by.



00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,310
The door is open.



00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,230
So, I come to ask the way.



00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:17,800
You asked the wrong guy.



00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,190
I just moved here.



00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,430
I don’t know the way.



00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,230
Childe.



00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,520
Do you know you have an incurable disease



00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,470
and you’re dying?



00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,470
You can’t



00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,110
cure me?



00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,560
No.



00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,280
You’re affected by evil power.



00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,350
I dare say that



00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,160
no ordinary doctors can cure you.



00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,400
But I can.



00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,760
Mubai.



00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,880
This is…



00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,190
I’m a doctor,



00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,640
travelling around the territories



00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,710
and see patients.



00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,830
You seem to be a doctor, too.



00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:11,310
I just know some pharmacology.



00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,520
Seems like you’re a couple.



00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,800
Would you like me



00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,400
to try to treat him?



00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,560
Forget it.



00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,920
Childe.



00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,280
Do you want to think about it?



00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:31,280
Weak as you are,



00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,640
I’m afraid you can’t do any labor work.



00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,520
That explains.



00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,590
Look at the poor girl.



00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,520
She’s young,



00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,680
but already has white hair.



00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,800
What’s going on?



00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,400
If he once practiced,



00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,800
this is a normal phenomenon.



00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,070
When he becomes healthy again,



00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,430
he gets his power back, too.



00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:16,830
Childe.



00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,230
Try your power.



00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:41,950
Miss.



00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,400
Go cook something.



00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,350
He needs



00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,680
to get more nutrition.



00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:46,560
Okay.



00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,710
I’ll go cook.



00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,230
Who the hell are you?



00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It’s you?



00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,110
Childe Liu.



00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,710
Godfather wants you to work for us again.



00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,310
The old me



00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,680
died in White Horse City.



00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,070
Right in front of you



00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,710
is a loser away from the secular world.



00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,880
Go find someone else.



00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,310
Godfather values you.



00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,230
If you continue to work for us,



00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,470
I promise you’ll return to normal,



00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,070
and even get better



00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,110
as a real strong man.



00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,710
I just want to be an ordinary guy.



00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,070
I don’t want to



00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,310
interfere with your business.



00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,110
Childe Liu.



00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,680
I’m not asking you.



00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,160
You can refuse to leave with me.



00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,400
You’ll just die.



00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,640
But what about Miss Tang?



00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,760
She’s so young.



00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,520
Do you want her to die with you?



00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,800
It’s between us.



00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,520
Leave the outsider alone.



00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,680
Outsider?



00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,590
But she’s your wife.



00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,400
She’s in.



00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,430
Her life



00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,560
is in your hands.



00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,400
Either to come or stay,



00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,190
make the decision.



00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,830
Childe Liu.



00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:24,160
What’s your decision?



00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,710
Mubai.



00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:29,830
I’m back.



00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,920
I’ve made much money today.



00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,430
Mubai.



00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,920
My dear wife,



00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,800
I was crippled



00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,000
and lost all hope.



00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,400
Now I’m recovered.



00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,880
There are many things I haven’t completed.



00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,920
I still want to try.



00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,350
Marrying you in this place



00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,680
is the best moment I’ve ever experienced.



00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,280
I’m leaving.



00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,680
Don’t miss me or look for me.



00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,830
Mubai!



00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,230
Mu Chen?



00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,000
Mu Chen!



00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,040
Mu Chen!



00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,040
I asked you not to come!



00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,470
Just take a rest here.



00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,400
I’m fine.



00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,920
Have some rest.



00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,400
If you fall,



00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,920
I have to take care of you.



00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,710
I’m really fine.



00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,430
Let’s continue.



00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,920
We haven’t found the Phoenix Heritage yet.



00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,070
But Mu Chen is lost.



00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,880
This place is so big!



00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,160
When can we find him?



00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:52,800
Think about it.



00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,920
Could Mu Chen be dead?



00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,590
Don’t jinx it!



00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,000
Say something positive!



00:23:58,830 --> 00:23:59,470
No.



00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,070
I don’t want him to die.



00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,350
I mean, if he was caught by



00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,880
the Evil Deity’s men,



00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,640
he would not live.



00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,230
I’m connected with Mu Chen



00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,680
and we live and die together.



00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,800
If he dies,



00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,280
I’ll die, too.



00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:17,880
But…



00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,920
I won’t let him die.



00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,350
That explains.



00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,280
The fake Mu Ling went for you,



00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,230
because he wanted to kill Mu Chen.



00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,760
We must find him!



00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,710
I don’t want you to be hurt!



00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,920
Don’t worry.



00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,920
Mu Chen will not easily get killed.



00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,280
But look at you!



00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,000
I’m afraid you’ll fall and die.



00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,520
Are you hungry?



00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,950
I’ll go get you something to eat.



00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:51,950
I’m not hungry.



00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,310
Stay here.



00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,560
I’ll be right back.



00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,560
Childe Liu.



00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,640
Why are you walking so fast?



00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,680
Maybe Miss Tang has gone back home



00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,830
after reading the letter.



00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,470
She won’t come after you.



00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,430
Mubai.



00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,230
Mubai.



00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,560
Why are you leaving?



00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,190
Don’t you even turn around



00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,880
and look at me?



00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,470
Childe Liu.



00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,160
How merciless you are!



00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,160
You just abandon



00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,760
your newly-married wife?



00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,040
Shut up!



00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,470
Why do you come?



00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,880
Didn’t I ask you to go back home?



00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,520
Mubai.



00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,000
Didn’t we make a deal?



00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,760
We promised to



00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,710
be an ordinary couple



00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,000
and live a peaceful life.



00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,710
Didn’t you say



00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,710
you would never leave me again?



00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,710
I explained clearly in the letter.



00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,430
I want to say no more.



00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:19,880
Go.



00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,230
I’m your wife.



00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:25,680
Wherever you go,



00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,040
I go with you.



00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,110
Tang Qian’er.



00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:30,920
Don’t you understand?



00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,280
I’ve been using you!



00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,800
I promised to live a peaceful life with you,



00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,110
just because I was crippled



00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,640
who must be looked after.



00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,680
Now I’m recovered.



00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,400
I don’t need you anymore.



00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,520
Understood?



00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,680
I don’t believe that.



00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,520
You won’t do that.



00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,680
How silly you are!



00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,430
I no longer loved you!



00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,680
Don’t bother me again.



00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,560
Brother!



00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,190
Brother.



00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,590
Luo Li fell in love with a human



00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,350
and killed the envoys.



00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,350
That was getting around in our clan.



00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,830
Clansmen are burning with rage,



00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,230
asking for an explanation.



00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:38,470
I think



00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,160
Luo Qingya and his men must be behind it.



00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,280
Shall we catch them



00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,280
and deal with them?



00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:43,830
Tianlong.



00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,590
Don't act on impulse.



00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,230
The priority



00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,640
is to calm them down.



00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,400
Leader!



00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,310
Clansmen are objecting greatly.



00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,190
Why don’t we



00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,680
give Luo Li to them?



00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,760
Elders.



00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,950
Didn’t we agree to keep it secret



00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,430
and discuss about it



00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:04,430
after the sacrifice?



00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,110
I didn’t tell anyone about it.



00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,710
How dare you deny!



00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,280
We didn’t say anything.



00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,470
You didn’t?



00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,710
But only the four of us knew it.



00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,830
Are you suspecting me?



00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,760
Elder Long.



00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,110
We’re not



00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,680
the only four who knew it.



00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,760
Xue God Clan may also disperse the rumor



00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:21,950
to disturb us.



00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,110
There’s no use in discussing it.



00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,470
People knew about it.



00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,400
We have to explain.



00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,920
Elder Qingya.



00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,280
How do you want me to explain?



00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,760
Go to the altar



00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,350
and make a vow



00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,590
in front of all clansmen,



00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,430
that you’ve never gone against our rules



00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,800
or violate the prohibition.



00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,430
Elder Qingya.



00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,110
In the past days,



00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,680
I’ve been staying with her.



00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:46,880
I can testify for her.



00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,830
You’re a mere guard.



00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,230
How dare you talk!



00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:53,190
Li Xuantong is my sworn brother.



00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,470
Why can’t he talk?



00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,470
Saintess!



00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,070
Okay.



00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,920
Leave this alone.



00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,040
Don’t avoid the question.



00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,590
Just go to the altar and swear.



00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,160
Do you dare?



00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,590
Leader!



00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,310
Leader!



00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,430
Xue Lingzi besieged Luo City



00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:17,430
with his troops.



00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,430
What?



00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:21,800
He said



00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,800
he wanted to discuss with you



00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,310
about the marriage with Saintess.



00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,230
How dare he!



00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,880
Discuss with troops?



00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,920
He’s obviously threatening us!



00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,160
Brother.



00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,040
What should we do?



00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,310
I’ll go talk with him.



00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:41,950
Leader.



00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,920
Xue Lingzi is always rude.



00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,400
What if he detains you?



00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,400
If I don’t go,



00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,310
he will attack us immediately.



00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,950
When I go, I can stall for time.



00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,470
Get ready for fight soon.



00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:55,560
Grandpa.



00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,400
Don’t go!



00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,920
Don’t try to stop me.



00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,470
Tianlong.



00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,070
Keep an eye on her.



00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,520
Don’t let her do anything stupid.



00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,110
Brother, don’t…



00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,400
I’m the leader.



00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,520
Listen to me.



00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,470
Luo Tianhe.



00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,400
We hold different political views.



00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,040
But…



00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,070
you’re so responsible!



00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,710
I admire you!



00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,640
I’ll go with you.



00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,920
Okay.



00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,920
Grandpa!



00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,520
Luo Li!



00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,520
Stay right here!



00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,920
If…



00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,710
If anything goes wrong,



00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,520
take the order from Grandpa Tianlong.



00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,430
Don’t worry, Brother.



00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:40,160
I’ll take good care of Luo Li.



00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,640
Thank you then.



00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,040
Let’s go.



00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,430
Found nothing, huh?



00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,590
Since I entered this forest,



00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:14,760
I have seen nothing,



00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,680
but worms.



00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,710
You’re right.



00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:19,760
Look!



00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,590
Do you want me to eat this?



00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,830
I’ve found a lot.



00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,040
Have a try.



00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,710
No!



00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:34,110
Don’t you fear it’s poisonous?



00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,230
It’s not.



00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,830
It’s the larva of moth.



00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,830
It’s tasty.



00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:38,560
Have a try.



00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,160
No, thanks.



00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,070
You’re a bird.



00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,190
You can eat worms.



00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,310
But I’m a human.



00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,400
Forget it.



00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,040
It’s also meat!



00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,880
No. I’ll just...



00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,710
Forget it.



00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,920
I’m not hungry.



00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,830
You’re too weak.



00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,560
Good boy.



00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,470
Take one.



00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,000
I’m really not hungry!



00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,830
Eat it!



00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,160
Even if I do,



00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,160
I have to roast it.



00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,310
It’s done.



00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,350
Have a try.



00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,950
Why do I think



00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,640
you don’t care if I’m hungry?



00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,920
You just want me to eat worms.



00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,680
I don’t deny that.



00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,430
How does it taste?



00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,040
Not bad.



00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,680
Why do you look depressed?



00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,190
I saw black leaf trees



00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,080
over there.



00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,429
The sap could be delicious.



00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,870
I’ll go get some for you.



00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,190
Dovetail leaf?



00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,080
Why does the mosquito only bite me,



00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:31,949
instead of you?



00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,190
Crush it and apply it to your skin.



00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,630
No mosquitoes will bite you.



00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,469
Before Mu Che disappeared,



00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,389
I found one,



00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,080
to expel the mosquitoes for him.



00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:43,469
Exactly this one!



00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,520
Are you sure?



00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,710
Is it so rare to find one?



00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:52,000
I marked it.



00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:53,760
It can’t be wrong.



00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,320
The environment may change.



00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,430
But magic plants won’t.



00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,600
It’s just camouflage.



00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,800
But…



00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,600
I don’t feel it’s illusion.



00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,230
You don’t know Land of Beasts.



00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,080
Such powerless plants



00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,910
can always be removed.



00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,280
But magic plants can’t.



00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,360
They won’t be influenced.



00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,910
In this way,



00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,360
the trees around us



00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,080
have been manipulated.



00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,630
Maybe that’s how Mu Chen was taken away.



00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,230
But it’s weird.



00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,390
Why do they make us run circles



00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,840
instead of killing us?



00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,230
I think



00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,150
they’re too busy dealing with Mu Chen



00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,000
to handle us.



00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:46,670
Jiuyou.



00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,080
You’re a magic beast.



00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,390
Can you tell the direction in the forest?



00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:52,840
I can find the direction



00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,870
even with my eyes closed



00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,320
in an ordinary forest.



00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,600
But this one



00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,470
is far too weird.



00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,390
If I hadn’t marked the plant,



00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,150
I wouldn’t have realized



00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,430
what we were suffering.



00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,390
We have to mark the magic plants, then.



00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,600
We must find the one behind it



00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,710
as soon as possible.



00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:17,630
How is it going?



00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,320
I’m done with the city defense.



00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,190
My trusted followers will defend it.



00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,120
By the way,



00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,470
is my brother back?



00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,230
Not yet.



00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:26,670
It’s getting dark.



00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,190
Could he be really…



00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,390
He isn’t back yet?



00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:30,710
Wait here for me.



00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,430
I’m going to find him.



00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,320
Grandpa Tianlong.



00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,320
We’re in an emergency.



00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,800
And we know nothing useful.



00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,120
If we act on impulse,



00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,670
there’ll be consequences.



00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,710
Why don’t we just wait?



00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:46,760
Luo Li!



00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:47,840
Brother.



00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:49,630
Luo Li.



00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:50,670
Go!



00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,040
Your grandpa and Elder Qingya



00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,520
are locked up by Xue Lingzi.



00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:54,870
But he wants you!



00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:55,950
Go, or it’ll be too late.



00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,430
How did that happen?



00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,430
I’m going to save my grandpa!



00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:00,840
No way.



00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,840
You’ll be biting the hook.



00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:04,910
Listen to me.



00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,360
Go to North Sect for help.



00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,080
We’ll try to defend here.



00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,280
Grandpa is in danger.



00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,470
How could I leave



00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,710
at this moment?



00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,710
Elders.



00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,950
Help to persuade her!



00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,230
Grandpa Tianlong.



00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,600
Don’t try to persuade me!



00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,390
I’m going to save my grandpa.



00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,760
Okay.



00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,600
I know I can’t stop you.



00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,000
But you know what?



00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,430
I will go with you!



00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,470
Luo Li!



00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,360
Brother.



00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,360
I’ve made up my mind.



00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:34,390
Forget it.



00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,950
I know I can’t stop you.



00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,870
I’ll go with you, too.



00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,360
Grandpa Tianlong.



00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,320
Brother.



00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,840
I’ll going to meet Xue Lingzi,



00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:44,950
pretending to agree with him



00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,230
to let down his guard.



00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,360
You can sneak into the camp



00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:50,390
and save Grandpa and Grandpa Qingya.



00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,190
No way.



00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,760
That’s too risky!



00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,600
Time is running out.



00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,470
The simplest way will work best.



00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,710
When you save them,



00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,430
there’ll be chaos.



00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,470
I can easily run away in the chaos.



00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,120
But…



00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,040
Xuantong.



00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:07,910
Don’t worry.



00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,630
I promised my brother



00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,360
to keep Luo Li safe.



00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:13,520
Uncle Xiu.



00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,470
Stay here for the command.



00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:16,840
Okay.



00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,670
Let’s go.



00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:52,630
Where’s my grandpa?



00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,230
He’s very fine.



00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:57,950
Don’t worry.



00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,040
Luo Li.



00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,320
You know what I want.



00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,390
As long as you agree,



00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,870
I’m pulling out right away.



00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,320
And I’ll give back everything



00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:13,190
that I’ve taken away



00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,430
from your clan.



00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,120
It’s okay.



00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,760
But let go of my grandpa and Grandpa Qingya first.



00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,670
Luo Li.



00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,760
I have true love for you.



00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,230
But you always want to lie to me.



00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:46,870
Grandpa Tianlong?



00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:48,870
Why are you…



00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,430
Luo Li.



00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,950
Surrender yourself.



00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,470
Don’t force me.



00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,320
Luo Li.



00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,600
You really hurt my heart.



00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,230
What have you done to Li Xuantong?



00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,470
Brother!



00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,710
Sorry, Luo Li.



00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,320
Luo Tianlong attacked me sneakily.



00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,600
But I trusted you!



00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,630
Do you still want to fight?



00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,280
Luo Li.



00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,670
It’s your luck when he wants to marry you.



00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,150
Why do you refuse?



00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,150
Think about your grandpa.



00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,840
And look at your sworn brother.



00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,390
Don’t be stupid!



00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:40,870
Don’t listen to them!



00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,560
Go!



00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,950
Let go of my grandpa.



00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:01,950
And let go of Li Xuantong.



00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:08,910
I’ll marry you.
