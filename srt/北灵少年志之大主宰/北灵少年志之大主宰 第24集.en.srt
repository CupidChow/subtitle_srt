[White Horse City]


3
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,000
Do you hear him?


4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,440
Go and look for Miss Jiuyou.


5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,840
Yes.


6
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,470
Don’t panic.


7
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:46,750
What’s that?


8
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,470
A human puppet.


9
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,560
Your machines are indeed ingenious.


10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,310
I heard long ago that


11
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,720
there were plenty of power talents


12
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,040
and magic circles emerged endlessly
in White Horse City.


13
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,470
But after I arrived here,


14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,480
I didn’t detect any magic power.


15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,120
That’s correct.


16
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,440
There were indeed plenty of talents here before.


17
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,630
But the city


18
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,950
has a complete mechanical system.


19
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,270
It’s more convenient than magic power.


20
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,230
Ten years ago,


21
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,830
I have forbidden practice of magic power


22
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:26,720
and driven out everything related.


23
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:27,910
What for?


24
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,509
Magic power


25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,680
will only bring about misfortune and disasters.


26
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,479
It’s because of its abandonment


27
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,190
that our city is peaceful today.


28
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,310
You’re new here.


29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,270
It’s normal that you can’t get it for the moment.


30
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,950
Why don’t you bring the lady outside in?


31
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:58,270
This picture


32
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,360
may be able to clear up your doubts.


33
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,160
Don’t worry.


34
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,030
As you know, there’s no magic power here


35
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,190
and you both practice it.


36
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,440
What do you need to worry about?


37
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,160
OK.


38
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,240
I’ll fetch her.


39
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:51,700
The Great Ruler


40
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,579
Episode 24


41
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,240
This picture bears the history of White Horse City


42
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,440
which was once


43
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,360
the largest city in the area.


44
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,630
It was crowded


45
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,910
and prosperous.


46
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:14,720
However,


47
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,440
after people became dependent on magic power,


48
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,480
everything changed.


49
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,350
Bigotry,


50
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:19,880
hatred


51
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,480
and conflicts occupied the whole city.


52
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,350
A great number of people were homeless.


53
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,830
Ten years ago,


54
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,760
colored clouds appeared in the sky.


55
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,070
Water in East Sea


56
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,480
gathered and formed an eye.


57
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,480
After this auspicious sign,


58
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,920
all citizens put their hatred aside


59
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,350
and stopped fighting.


60
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,480
The tragedy caused by magic power


61
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,920
was ended.


62
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,320
Ever since then,


63
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,550
I’ve forbidden practice and use of power.


64
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,510
But unavoidably some people insisted


65
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,070
and I had to expelled them.


66
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,270
Eventually our city restored prosperity and peace.


67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,390
You’re decisive


68
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,760
but I’m afraid you’re also a bit bigoted.


69
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,640
Magic power itself is never good or bad.


70
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,440
Only those who use it are.


71
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,790
If the user is virtuous,


72
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,160
there won’t be evil.


73
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,350
I witnessed great changes of this city.


74
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,600
Compared with your words,


75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,720
my own eyes are more believable.


76
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,040
Just now you said water in East Sea


77
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,640
gathered into an eye?


78
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:36,950
Yes.


79
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,950
It reminds me of a story I heard as a kid.


80
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,159
In a lake in Beiling,


81
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,720
a giant eye turned up out of thin air.


82
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,720
It seemed to be an auspicious sign


83
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,440
but actually it was absorbing magic power.


84
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,000
As time passed,


85
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,320
magic plants around all became empty.


86
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,040
What do you mean, Miss Luo Li?


87
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,720
I just want to warn you


88
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,200
not to be misled by the current peace


89
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,440
or you’ll in an irretrievable situation.


90
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,600
Nonsense.


91
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,230
The big eye in the sky


92
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,350
is an auspicious sign.


93
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,350
White Horse City is the best example.


94
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,070
Don’t be angry.


95
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,320
Luo Li was just looking out for your city.


96
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,200
Did the eye appear ten years ago?


97
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,600
Was there also


98
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,720
a white dragon here at that time?


99
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,510
I never heard of that.


100
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,440
You got a message. You got a message.


101
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,790
Miss Jiuyou


102
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,070
was on a mountain in the suburbs a few days ago.


103
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:42,880
A mountain.


104
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:43,760
OK.


105
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,790
Thank you, Mr. Bai.


106
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,440
Let’s go.


107
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,159
Wait.


108
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,720
There have been too many strangers recently.


109
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,390
I need to check defence of the city.


110
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,110
I’ll go with you.


111
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:54,880
Thank you, Mr. Bai.


112
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,440
Find out whether


113
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,160
he has magic power.


114
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,440
Come and have a look.


115
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,880
Lord.


116
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,390
Lord.


117
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,760
Lord.


118
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,600
Lord.


119
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,000
Mu Chen,


120
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,880
when Mr. Bai passed the reins to me just now,


121
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,600
I found that his power pulse was all damaged.


122
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,670
Lord.


123
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,480
Lord.


124
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,270
You’ve managed the city well.


125
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,920
You’re so popular with the people.


126
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,600
It’s nothing, Mr. Mu.


127
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,550
My dream is to


128
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,200
protect people in this city


129
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,230
so that they’ll have a steady and easy life.


130
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,320
Mr. Bai,


131
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,110
we’re in a wilderness


132
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,480
and there weren’t tracks of Jiuyou on our way here.


133
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,200
Did you make a mistake?


134
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,600
Indeed there was a mistake


135
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,110
but


136
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,600
it’s you who made it.


137
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,350
You’re a circle magician!


138
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,950
Isn’t your power pulse all damaged?


139
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:25,950
How come?


140
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,160
He could start up


141
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,070
such a powerful Catch Circle.


142
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,880
We underestimated him.


143
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,280
Anyone who may imperil White Horse City


144
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,640
will end up like this.


145
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,200
Mr. Bai,


146
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:35,880
you misunderstood.


147
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,230
We mean no harm.


148
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,880
Your magic power


149
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,470
is the harm.


150
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,470
Let’s get out of it first.


151
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:51,960
Luo Li,


152
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,080
don’t worry.


153
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,470
As long as it’s a magic circle,


154
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,110
I can definitely undo it.


155
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,670
I’m afraid we don’t have much time.


156
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,440
If we run out of magic power,


157
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,710
even if you figure something out,


158
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,960
we won’t be able to undo it.


159
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,230
There’s only one thing we can do then.


160
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,000
We’ll break it by force.


161
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,790
This magic circle will counter-attack.


162
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:15,710
It’s troublesome.


163
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,520
Yes.


164
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,200
Mu Chen,


165
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,150
what are you doing?


166
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,520
Of course trying to break this circle.


167
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,590
Don’t think about being a hero alone.


168
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,670
Let me out.


169
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,030
I never thought about being a hero.


170
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,550
I just need to make sure you’re safe.


171
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,910
You selfish wretch,


172
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,280
if anything happens to you,


173
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,440
what should I do?


174
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,000
Mu Chen!


175
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,880
So this is


176
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,440
the Power of Whisper.


177
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,150
Who is it?


178
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:15,760
It’s me.


179
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,110
Don’t stand there.


180
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,550
Come here.


181
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,550
Mubai,


182
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,110
I need to ask you a question.


183
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,590
What is it?


184
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,880
You’re so serious.


185
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,840
The other day


186
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,520
I helped you clean your room


187
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,350
and found a book.


188
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,150
A book?


189
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,520
There are


190
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,520
lots of books in my room.


191
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,790
It’s He Yao’s book.


192
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,710
Do you mean Soul Erasing Spell?


193
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,520
Yes.


194
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,910
Why is it here?


195
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:14,960
What are you thinking about?


196
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,840
Books like this should be burned.


197
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,550
I know.


198
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,400
Now we need to fight the Evil Deity


199
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,790
who’s extremely powerful.


200
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:27,280
But we know nothing about him.


201
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,150
I’m keeping this


202
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,230
to know more about it


203
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,670
so that the odds will be greater in our favor.


204
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,440
But it’s too dangerous.


205
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,150
Why didn’t you tell me?


206
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:43,880
These days


207
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,670
you’ve been


208
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,710
looking after me.


209
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:48,710
I don’t want you


210
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,670
to worry about me.


211
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:52,960
Qian’er,


212
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,150
I hope you’ll keep it secret for me.


213
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,550
Everyone has been exhausted


214
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,080
in order to protect North Sect.


215
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,840
I don’t want to worry them


216
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,230
or get into trouble.


217
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,550
Mubai.


218
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,230
What’s up?


219
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,590
Shen wants you to go to the classroom


220
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,030
discuss something important with you.


221
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:21,790
I’ve got it.


222
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:22,880
I’ll be right there.


223
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,150
Yes.


224
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,080
Why does Shen


225
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,000
want to see you?


226
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,320
Go and check with me.


227
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,280
I’m here, Shen,


228
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,200
Sun’er.


229
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,280
What is it that you want to


230
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,200
see me about?


231
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:54,760
Do you remember


232
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,880
we went to investigate dragon slaves


233
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:58,910
not long ago?


234
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,280
I asked you to investigate that village.


235
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,030
What did you find?


236
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,110
It’s quite bad.


237
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,000
Those villagers were eroded by the Power of Whisper.


238
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,110
How are they now?


239
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,400
When I arrived there,


240
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,550
the villagers had been


241
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,840
empty shells.


242
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,640
If I let them be,


243
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,590
I was afraid more people would
be eroded by the Power of Whisper.


244
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,150
I didn’t want them to suffer,


245
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:24,670
so...


246
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,590
I killed all of them.


247
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,150
Mubai, were you crazy?


248
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,400
How could you do that?


249
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,470
Those were lives.


250
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,960
Did you try to find another solution?


251
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,280
Once the Power of Whisper is pulled out by force,


252
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,840
they’ll die shortly.


253
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,150
If I let them watch their relatives


254
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,520
die one after another,


255
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,520
won’t that be crueler?


256
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,030
Have you thought about this?


257
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,200
Which is real mercy,


258
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,550
witness the death of your relatives lucidly


259
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,440
or die unconsciously?


260
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,840
I know the dangers of the Power of Whisper
better than anyone.


261
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,790
Because of it,


262
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,760
many families


263
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,200
were ruined in Liu Territory.


264
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,000
I saw soldiers who worked with me


265
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,470
and men who fought alongside me


266
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,200
being pained by the Power of Whisper.


267
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,320
So when I saw those villagers,


268
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,230
I didn’t want them to suffer the same.


269
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,960
Do you think you did the right thing?


270
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,110
What’s wrong about wiping out people


271
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,790
who are eroded by evil spirits?


272
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,520
In order to fight the Evil Deity,


273
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,710
I’m willing to pay any price.


274
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,280
If you think I did the wrong thing,


275
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,880
I’m willing to be punished.


276
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,640
Shen.


277
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,840
You misunderstood.


278
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,760
Mubai did that


279
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,910
just to fight against the Evil Deity.


280
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,640
Although it was a bit cruel,


281
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,230
perhaps he really


282
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,880
freed those villagers


283
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,440
from sufferings.


284
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,640
Don’t intercede for me.


285
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,080
Everything will incur a price.


286
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,670
You can understand me.


287
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,400
It’s enough already.


288
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:40,840
Shen,


289
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,520
I don’t


290
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,280
regret doing it.


291
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,230
Please punish me.


292
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,400
OK.


293
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,150
This matter will be left at that.


294
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,320
If things like this happen again,


295
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,520
I hope you’ll think twice.


296
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,200
Is anything else the matter?


297
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,470
If not,


298
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,520
I’ll be off.


299
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,910
Master killed everyone


300
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,760
in the village with a fan.


301
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,280
Gods must be punishing us.


302
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,910
Wait a minute.


303
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,440
What’s the matter?


304
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,150
You’re recovering well.


305
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,000
I wonder if so is your magic power.


306
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,590
I’d like to


307
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,910
battle with you.


308
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,470
Lotus Spell.


309
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,190
Shen used Lotus Spell.


310
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,000
Mubai.


311
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,710
Shen.


312
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,800
You hit him too hard.


313
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,470
Shen.


314
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,800
What are you doing here?


315
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,000
Shen,


316
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,350
didn’t you


317
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,760
go too far today?


318
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,760
Liu Mubai’s reaction


319
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,160
was weird today.


320
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,680
How come?


321
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,920
He has explained himself.


322
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,230
His explanation was too clear.


323
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,520
He didn’t panic at all.


324
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,470
He could still stay calm


325
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,160
after doing such an outrageous thing.


326
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,160
Don’t you think it’s weird?


327
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,950
If he’s really up to something,


328
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,430
he should have


329
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,560
seen that you’re suspecting him.


330
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,160
I will


331
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,310
spy on him.


332
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,830
That’s all we can do now.


333
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,190
Come on, take the medicine.


334
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,590
Shen


335
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:30,950
is really unbelievable.


336
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,310
He can battle with you


337
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,470
but what did he hit you so hard for?


338
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,000
You thought too much.


339
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,760
Now that we were battling,


340
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,520
of course we had to use all our strength.


341
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,470
No.


342
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,880
He can’t get away with it.


343
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,520
I’ll argue with him later.


344
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,310
Don’t.


345
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:45,590
Be a good girl.


346
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,400
We’re facing crises now.


347
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,760
We need to pull together.


348
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,350
Don’t make more issues for us.


349
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,640
I just can’t resign myself to it.


350
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,470
Don’t be bothered about these things.


351
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,830
My answer is still the same.


352
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,230
It’s enough already as long as


353
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,160
you understand me.


354
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,160
I’m tired.


355
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,560
I want to rest.


356
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,710
Have a good rest.


357
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,160
Come down.


358
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,230
You’re so affectionate


359
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,400
towards each other.


360
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,560
None of your business.


361
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,160
Shen Cangsheng is suspecting me.


362
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,430
We must


363
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,110
do something now.


364
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,310
You finally have a difficulty


365
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,560
and need me now.


366
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,070
Tell me.


367
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,280
What should we do?


368
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,160
Shen Cangsheng said Mu Chen was staying secluded.


369
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,680
I don’t believe him.


370
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,950
We can seize this chance to inquire about it.


371
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,830
It’d be best if we kill two birds with one stone.


372
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,280
What’s the other bird?


373
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,560
Stop them from suspecting me.


374
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:32,470
Luo Li.


375
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,110
Luo Li, wake up.


376
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,590
Where are we?


377
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,800
I have no idea.


378
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,920
Weren’t we trapped in a magic circle?


379
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,310
Catch Circle.


380
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,520
It’s Bai Xuan.


381
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:00,280
This matter is not as simple as we thought.


382
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:03,880
Jiuyou,


383
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,430
what are you doing here?


384
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,040
It’s a good thing you’re alright.


385
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,640
We looked a long time for you.


386
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,430
Jiuyou,


387
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,470
were you caught by Bai Xuan, too?


388
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,640
How come you’re here?


389
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,560
It’s useless.


390
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,280
Don’t waste your strength.


391
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,640
Bai Xuan trapped us here


392
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,560
and you’re guarding us.


393
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,560
You can both use Catch Circles.


394
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,560
Are you...


395
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,000
Bai Xuan is my father.


396
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,830
I’m Bai Tong.


397
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,110
Bai Tong is Bai Xuan’s son.


398
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,110
Why did he do that?


399
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,000
I’m wondering, too.


400
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,040
If as Bai Xuan said,


401
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,830
magic power is not allowed in the city.


402
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,760
How can we explain about Bai Tong?


403
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,710
And these magic circles.


404
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,430
They must


405
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,110
have a skeleton in the closet.


406
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,190
But we’re stuck here


407
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,590
being tired and hungry.


408
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,640
I have no idea when we can get out.


409
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,520
I’m so full.


410
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:44,800
Jiuyou,


411
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,680
why are you here?


412
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,520
What happened?


413
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,190
Why did Bai Tong


414
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,400
give you meat to eat?


415
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,920
His name is Bai Tong?


416
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,640
I thought


417
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,760
he didn’t have a name.


418
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,230
He didn’t reply


419
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,350
every time I spoke to him.


420
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,310
I thought he was dumb.


421
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,830
What on earth is going on?


422
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,920
He trapped me with a magic circle.


423
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,110
I was here when I woke up.


424
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,680
He’s rather elusive.


425
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,710
If he didn’t bring food for me every day,


426
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,560
I could never see him.


427
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,760
And when I spoke to him,


428
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,680
he made no reply.


429
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,400
Why couldn’t I find you


430
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,190
when our vessels were connected?


431
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,560
Do you know how worried


432
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,830
we were after we lost you?


433
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,160
Probably blood connection


434
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,430
will stop working sometimes.


435
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,110
Oh, yes?


436
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,680
As far as I know,


437
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,560
only the two people concerned


438
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,280
can break the connection.


439
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,000
I’m fine.


440
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,190
Stop asking.


441
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,040
Jiuyou,


442
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,400
we’re here to do something serious.


443
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,040
You left without permission


444
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,310
and cut off our connection.


445
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,560
Do you know how dangerous the situation is now?


446
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,830
I’ve explained.


447
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,830
Stop asking.


448
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,470
Alright,


449
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,110
don’t quarrel.


450
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,280
What’s the most important now
is to break the circles.


451
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:25,710
Thanks.


452
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,470
I think this matter


453
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,160
is not as simple as we thought.


454
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,310
Bai Xuan tricked and attacked us


455
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,400
but he didn’t try to kill us.


456
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,590
Indeed.


457
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,830
We were stuck in his Catch Circle


458
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,830
but weren’t harmed a bit.


459
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,560
It should have been planned early.


460
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,470
But these


461
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,350
are just guesses.


462
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,640
We need to find the reasons.


463
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,430
That’s easy.


464
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,640
We can just catch Bai Tong.


465
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,350
Catch Bai Tong?


466
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,880
Bai Xuan is his father.


467
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,230
He knows the best.


468
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,310
Jiuyou,


469
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,000
I think Bai Tong


470
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,040
was quite nice to you.


471
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,430
Yet you’re gonna be so heartless?


472
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,950
I think she’s right.


473
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,830
That’s the best method.


474
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,310
Yes.


475
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,280
Mu Chen, you ambush here.


476
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:11,950
Jiuyou,


477
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,640
let’s look for Bai Tong.


478
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,040
OK.


479
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,520
Why should I stay here?


480
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,310
Now the school is in harsh times.


481
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,350
You must keep a lookout.


482
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:43,710
Yes.


483
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,350
Everything is being prepared now.


484
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,800
Don’t act without permission


485
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,590
whatever you see.


486
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,040
You must report to me first.


487
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:34,430
Shen,


488
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,070
Liu Mubai just left.


489
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,070
It seems


490
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,950
he’s heading for Mu Chen’s room.


491
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,400
Huo Feng,


492
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,430
what are you doing in Mu Chen’s room?


493
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,040
Don’t talk rubbish.


494
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,400
So you are the spy.


495
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,190
Liu Mubai.


496
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:14,520
Shen,


497
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:15,590
let me through.


498
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,950
Mu Chen is staying secluded.


499
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,160
I’ve ordered that


500
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,880
no one disturb him.


501
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,190
Why did you come here?


502
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,830
I did so many things for our sect


503
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,110
yet you’re still suspecting me.


504
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,560
Let me tell you.


505
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,880
The spy in our sect


506
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,310
is Huo Feng.


507
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,160
If you believe me,


508
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,880
chase him with me.


509
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,800
If you don’t,


510
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,160
don’t stop me.


511
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,310
When I catch him,


512
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,920
the full story will come out.


513
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:54,590
Huo Feng?


514
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,190
How come?


515
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,280
He’s fleeing to the mountain behind.


516
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,880
There are only two routes from here to there.


517
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:05,560
If you believe me,


518
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,310
go there as well.


519
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:09,680
OK.


520
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,280
Let’s chase him separately.


521
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,400
Remember.


522
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:13,880
When you find him,


523
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,760
tell me immediately.


524
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:15,680
Yes.


525
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:21,950
Run after him now.


526
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,760
I’ll handle things here.


527
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:00,560
Huo Feng,


528
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,230
you’re really the spy.


529
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,070
Answer me.


530
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,400
Why did you sell out to the Evil Deity?


531
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,520
The Power of Whisper.


532
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,070
You have evil powers.


533
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,680
Wonderful.


534
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,040
Wonderful.


535
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:10,920
Mubai,


536
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,400
put an end to him now.


537
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,000
I will.


538
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,040
But before that,


539
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,310
I need you to do me a favor


540
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,430
so that no one will suspect me anymore.


541
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,400
What is it?


542
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,430
Shen.


543
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:40,760
Are you alright?


544
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,190
I didn’t expect Huo Feng


545
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,800
would have such strong evil powers.


546
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,760
Luckily I didn’t let him flee.


547
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:03,880
Your wound.


548
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,190
I’m OK.


549
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,760
Huo Feng is the spy.


550
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:13,760
I’m sorry,


551
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:14,680
Mubai.


552
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,560
I was mistaken about you.


553
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:22,680
I’m OK.


554
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:34,680
There’s a mark of


555
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,350
the Power of Whisper on Huo Feng’s body.


556
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:38,520
He’s He Yao’s accomplice.


557
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:40,160
I need to


558
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,800
thank Mubai this time.


559
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:44,560
If it hadn’t been for you,


560
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I would have lost my life.


561
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,560
You exaggerated, Shen.


562
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,070
So


563
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,230
the spy has been acting under our nose.


564
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,590
We were negligent.


565
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,000
At any rate,


566
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,590
Mubai should get the credit


567
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,830
for finding the spy.


568
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,400
It’s nothing.


569
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,640
We’re all part of North Sect.


570
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,040
It’s what I ought to do.


571
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,670
This time


572
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,909
I was injured by the Power of Whisper.


573
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,080
I may need some time


574
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,280
to stay secluded for a recovery.


575
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,360
I asked you to come here


576
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,469
because I hope


577
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,670
you’ll handle affairs of the sect


578
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,840
when I’m staying secluded.


579
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:26,190
Our sect is facing crises.


580
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:28,760
Nothing should go wrong now.


581
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,670
Don’t worry, Shen.


582
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:33,230
We’ll do our best.


583
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,600
Shen,


584
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,520
I need to make a request.


585
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:40,230
Feel free to say it.


586
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:41,909
You’re staying secluded today.


587
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,630
There’s something


588
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,080
I want to be clear about.


589
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:46,670
Go on.


590
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,560
It’s about Mu Chen.


591
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:52,670
Sun’er,


592
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,429
leave us.


593
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,429
I have something


594
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,150
to tell Mubai.


595
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,390
OK.


596
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,230
Mubai,


597
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,120
what I’m going to say


598
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,430
mustn’t be mentioned to anyone.


599
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,120
This


600
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,080
is just between


601
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:19,950
you


602
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,470
and me.


603
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:22,800
OK.


604
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,520
Mu Chen and the others


605
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,120
have left the school.


606
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,800
What?


607
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:31,910
In order to fight the Black Dragon,


608
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,950
we must find the White Dragon.


609
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,600
But we only know


610
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:41,910
his whereabouts can be found in White Horse City.


611
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,080
Mu Chen and the others have left here


612
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,910
for White Horse City.


613
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,280
I see.


614
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,430
No wonder when Huo Feng
opened the door of Mu Chen’s room,


615
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,000
no one was in it.


616
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:55,870
And I was so worried.


617
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,760
So you need to know


618
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,390
when I stay secluded,


619
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,190
you can only rely on yourselves.


620
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,120
Don’t worry.


621
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,040
As long as I’m here,


622
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,000
nothing bad will happen.


623
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,470
The Power of Whisper on your body


624
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,710
will disappear in three days.


625
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,710
In order to avoid more dispute,


626
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,840
I’ll put an end to you today.


627
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,760
You stopped them from suspecting me


628
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,630
and I buried you.


629
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:26,520
We’re even.


630
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,320
Jiuyou,


631
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,870
did you leave


632
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,190
because of the bracelet?


633
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:54,560
No.


634
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,150
What bracelet?


635
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,800
The one you left.


636
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,360
I don’t like it, OK?


637
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,230
And it’s not for me.


638
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,280
In any case,


639
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,840
you mustn’t run away again.


640
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:09,710
There is some strange power in this city


641
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,910
and we haven’t known


642
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,000
Bai Xuan and Bai Tong’s purposes yet.


643
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:18,040
We also have to find the White Dragon
as quickly as possible.


644
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,120
Fine.


645
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,560
Got it.


646
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,950
I won’t make trouble for you again.


647
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,760
It’s not about trouble.


648
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,190
If you go missing again,


649
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,910
Mu Chen and I will worry.


650
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:30,800
OK.


651
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,430
I’ve got it.


652
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,080
Where shall we look for Bai Tong?


653
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,390
He brought you hares and wild fruits
every time he came back.


654
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:41,950
So


655
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,360
let’s go to places with dense shrubs.


656
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,600
We should be able to find him there.


657
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,040
How can we make him go back, then?


658
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:51,040
Instead of that,


659
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,910
let’s catch him right away.


660
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:53,950
OK.


661
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,120
Let’s go.


662
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,280
You broke my Catch Circle.


663
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,760
Looks like you’ve got some knack.


664
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,360
If you weren’t good at roasting,


665
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,630
I would have been out long ago.


666
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,710
I’d advise you to surrender now


667
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:25,870
or I may hurt you.


668
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,430
Some hope!


669
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,040
I asked you to surrender


670
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,280
and you refused.


671
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,600
You trapped me for such a long time.


672
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,950
Now it’s your turn to be trapped.


673
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,670
Hurry.


674
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,600
You asked me


675
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:05,760
to ambush him here.


676
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,080
Because we’re good.


677
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,360
Go.


678
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:09,950
Bai Tong,


679
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,080
why did you and your father
seal off White Horse City?


680
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,390
That’s to


681
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:16,520
stop those who are as malevolent as you


682
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,080
from destroying our auspicious sign.


683
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,280
Auspicious sign?


684
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:20,800
Do you really think it’s an auspicious sign?


685
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,630
This is such a big city


686
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,710
but there are only young people here.


687
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:24,870
They all have a


688
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,470
mysterious smile on their faces.


689
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,040
They’re not normal already.


690
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,870
I’m afraid the word “insane”


691
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,000
will be more appropriate.


692
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,320
I saw a gigantic evil eye


693
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,280
above the sea in the picture.


694
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,190
In my opinion,


695
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,390
your city is not peaceful at all.


696
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,000
It’s full of darkness,


697
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,870
isn’t it?


698
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,150
Anyway,


699
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,150
you’d better leave now.


700
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,600
You shouldn’t have come here.


701
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,910
What are you up to?


702
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,040
Did you sell out to the Evil Deity?


703
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,230
Nonsense.


704
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:02,120
The Bai family have loyally


705
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,280
guarded White Horse City for generations.


706
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,360
Why would we do such a shameful thing?


707
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,360
What are you thinking about, then?


708
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,430
Tell us.


709
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,840
Speak.


710
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:13,560
If you hadn’t


711
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,080
brought food for me every day,


712
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:16,870
I would have burned you to death.


713
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,630
Never mind.


714
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,120
We’ll go into the city


715
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:21,150
and check things out.


716
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:24,910
Walk faster.


717
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,910
How’s that possible?


718
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,710
When was this tunnel made?


719
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,000
What are you mumbling?


720
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,560
Move.


721
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:01,800
Qingshan.


722
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:04,800
Sun’er.


723
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,840
You protected Dragon Roc


724
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,150
and the Protection Circle.


725
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:10,600
Good job.


726
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:11,950
No big deal.


727
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,390
The intensification is almost done.


728
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,320
Now we only need Mr. Dragon Roc


729
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,600
to keep the circle working.


730
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,710
How is it in the school these days?


731
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,120
It should be in peace I think.
