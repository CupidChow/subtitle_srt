[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,310
Mubai.

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:11,800
Watch out!

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,920
Stop!

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:15,720
Mubai.

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:16,550
Mubai.

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:17,760
Are you OK?

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:18,920
I’m fine.

9
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,000
Don't worry.

10
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,680
Master,

11
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,600
what exactly is this

12
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,150
Power of Whisper?

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,520
Power of Whisper

14
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,040
is my master’s blessing.

15
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,430
Even amateurs,

16
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,080
endowed with this power

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,590
can become skilled masters.

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,000
If the entire force of Liu Territory

19
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,880
acquires this power,

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,200
it can take over

21
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,360
Mu Territory effortlessly.

22
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,720
The solution you proposed yesterday

23
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,200
is to have our soldiers

24
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,720
be blessed, too?

25
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,910
Correct.

26
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:51,790
No way!

27
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,520
It’s not a blessing

28
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,310
but a curse.

29
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,150
They're no longer humans!

30
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,840
Those two are too weak

31
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,910
to absorb such great power.

32
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,760
That’s why they became insane.

33
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,480
They’ll recover after some time.

34
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,120
Don’t worry.

35
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,120
How do I know if you’re telling the truth?

36
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,680
I can’t stake Liu Territory’s future.

37
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,039
This kind of evil power

38
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,120
is better to be abandoned.

39
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,270
I’m saying this for your good.

40
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,760
This way, your cooperation with the Dragon Clan

41
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,680
won't be a problem.

42
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,400
No one will oppose to it.

43
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:28,440
Father,

44
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,830
don't listen to him.

45
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,590
He doesn't care about our territory at all.

46
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,400
Young Master Liu,

47
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,000
calm down,

48
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,440
or you’ll be dizzy again.

49
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,190
Mubai.

50
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,360
Mubai.

51
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,080
It’s you!

52
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,509
You did this, didn't you?

53
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,190
It's called Soul Devouring Poison.

54
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,910
Without activating it,

55
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,510
he’ll only feel woozy

56
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,600
but his life is guaranteed.

57
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,110
Lord Liu,

58
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,960
I’m giving you a way out.

59
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,750
As you can see,

60
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,800
if your men absorb this power,

61
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:21,520
you’ll gain a foothold

62
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,190
not only in Beiling

63
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,470
but in the entire world.

64
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,320
Besides,

65
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,110
aren’t you worried about your son?

66
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,079
Father,

67
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,270
I’m fine.

68
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,160
It’s OK.

69
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,240
I’ll give you some time to consider.

70
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,030
Before you make up your mind,

71
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,360
I don’t want more people to get wind of this.

72
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:51,820
The Great Ruler

73
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,780
Episode 11

74
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,480
Father,

75
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,200
you mentioned that Mr. Tang

76
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,320
pretends to cooperate with Liu Territory.

77
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,950
I’ll agree to ally with Liu Qingtian

78
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,200
to gain his trust,

79
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,200
and then marry Qian’er into the Liu’s

80
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,480
so that she and Mubai can get married.

81
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,200
Our engagement still exists.

82
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,230
Their marriage right now

83
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,270
is the best insurance.

84
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,550
You’re bold.

85
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,440
Aren’t you afraid of death?

86
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,200
You infiltrated into the enemies’ base

87
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,070
along with Qian'er.

88
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,480
You’re bolder than me.

89
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,200
Mr. Tang,

90
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,830
you saw what happened

91
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,070
in that hall.

92
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,790
I didn’t expect No-Face Taoist would do that.

93
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,480
Would Mr. Liu agree to his condition?

94
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,070
Hard to say.

95
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,880
If the entire Liu force

96
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,600
gains that power,

97
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,230
we’ll have no chance to win.

98
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,510
Power of Whisper isn’t too much trouble

99
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,880
but Liu Mubai

100
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,000
is poisoned.

101
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,920
We must save him.

102
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,070
You can handle that power?

103
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,270
Trust me,

104
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,480
Mr. Tang.

105
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,440
OK.

106
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,510
You and your father are always resourceful.

107
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,440
I trust you.

108
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,720
What do you need me to do?

109
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,790
An elite squad

110
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,600
will be dispatched from Mu Territory

111
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,270
to attack support units of Liu,

112
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,640
but they’ll fail and be caught

113
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,000
and be imprisoned in the capital.

114
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,880
Once the time is right,

115
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,480
they’ll break out of jail

116
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,830
and launch the attack from the inside

117
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,920
to capture Liu Qingtian and No-Face Taoist

118
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,670
to end the war for good.

119
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,790
Distraction

120
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,200
and ambush.

121
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,040
Brilliant!

122
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,510
Mu Chen,

123
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,950
you need my help to release

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,230
the captured,

125
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,040
right?

126
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:52,720
Exactly.

127
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,000
You overestimate me.

128
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,110
I’m simply a guest here.

129
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,550
How could I free them from jail?

130
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,230
Also,

131
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,720
Liu soldiers hate your men’s guts.

132
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:06,950
How can you be sure

133
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,110
that they’ll be brought back

134
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,790
instead of being killed instantly.

135
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,510
You have a point.

136
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,880
To make the plan work,

137
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,390
we also need other help.

138
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,440
Liu Mubai?

139
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,200
Yes.

140
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,760
Father.

141
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,320
It’s useless.

142
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,070
I've heard of

143
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,390
this Soul Devouring Poison.

144
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,000
It’s connected with the poisoner’s power.

145
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,000
Either No-Face Taoist removes it himself

146
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,070
or the victim dies.

147
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,350
There’s

148
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,390
no other solutions.

149
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,950
I’m so useless.

150
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,830
I’m so sorry.

151
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,200
Don’t say that.

152
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,110
You did nothing wrong.

153
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,950
It’s all that Taoist's fault.

154
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,040
You cannot work with him.

155
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,600
You're my only son.

156
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,600
My life is worthless.

157
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,590
Millions of the clansmen

158
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,200
are the foundation of our land.

159
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:38,789
I know what to do.

160
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,080
Come in.

161
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,030
Master.

162
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,670
Am I interrupting you?

163
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,030
Lord Liu,

164
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,400
you came in the middle of the night.

165
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,550
I assume you've made your decision.

166
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,590
Yes.

167
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,760
I’ll follow your lead.

168
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,230
From now on,

169
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,200
I’ll depend on you.

170
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,840
That’s right.

171
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,470
You have to depend on me.

172
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,790
Lord Liu,

173
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,000
killing me isn’t as easy as you thought.

174
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,110
If you try to sneak up on others,

175
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,200
remember to hide your power first.

176
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:40,080
Or, they’ll see through it instantly.

177
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,000
If I die,

178
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,350
you won’t get out of here alive.

179
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,960
Lord Liu,

180
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,470
I know you have tons of skilled guards.

181
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,200
If they strike me together,

182
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,080
I can’t beat them all.

183
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,790
But if I die in your place,

184
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,910
my master will seek revenge.

185
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,280
When that time comes,

186
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,350
there will be no man standing here.

187
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,590
I know you're eager to save your son,

188
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,350
but killing me

189
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,840
will only make things worse.

190
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,910
I think a smart man like you

191
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,320
should know that.

192
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,200
Leave.

193
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,230
Uncle. Master.

194
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,670
What brings you here?

195
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,080
We’re patrolling.

196
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,910
Thanks for your service.

197
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,350
Were you attacked on the way?

198
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,080
We met

199
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,320
a few stragglers

200
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,550
and crushed them easily.

201
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,710
You’re indeed capable.

202
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,760
I’m sure your father

203
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,550
will be proud of you in heaven.

204
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,790
I’ll wipe out all those Mu scums

205
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,520
to avenge my father’s death.

206
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,200
Liu Yang,

207
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:14,710
you did well.

208
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,550
You can go back and rest.

209
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,030
Uncle,

210
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,030
I can go with you.

211
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,880
No, thanks.

212
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,320
Go back.

213
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,030
Yes.

214
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,150
Those grains are shipping to Xiong City tomorrow,

215
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,030
right?

216
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,320
Yes.

217
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,640
If you have a plan,

218
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,590
better execute it now.

219
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,150
Mu Chen?

220
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,400
What are you waiting for?

221
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,640
Let me in.

222
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,230
Or I’ll be caught.

223
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,320
Is that what you want?

224
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,640
Come in.

225
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,440
Why are you here?

226
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,550
I know

227
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,790
you’re poisoned.

228
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,150
You shouldn’t have come.

229
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,000
I know

230
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,960
but I have to.

231
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,230
What do you want?

232
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,640
I’m here as an envoy

233
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,350
to talk you into working with me

234
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,150
against No-Face Taoist.

235
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,590
My father trusts him a lot.

236
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,320
Working against him

237
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,230
is working against my father.

238
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,280
I’m his heir.

239
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,030
That gives you more reason

240
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,200
to help me.

241
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,080
Or you’d rather see your father,

242
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:28,910
you

243
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,280
and all your people

244
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,200
become the walking dead?

245
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,640
You saw everything?

246
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,030
Yes.

247
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,670
Mubai,

248
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,790
your father is willing to

249
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,880
do anything for you.

250
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,440
Wait here for me.

251
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,320
Don't go anywhere.

252
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,280
Father!

253
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,400
Father!

254
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,080
Father!

255
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,150
Father!

256
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,760
Follow me.

257
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,470
Luo Li!

258
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,150
Luo Li!

259
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,400
Calm down.

260
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,550
Let’s go!

261
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,640
No.

262
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,350
I must get her out.

263
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,840
No-Face Taoist will be here anytime.

264
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,760
If you die,

265
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,550
who will save her?

266
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,200
Go.

267
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,550
Let’s go.

268
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,150
Are you alright, Master?

269
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,470
I’m fine.

270
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,790
False alarm.

271
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,200
Should the security be tightened?

272
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,280
No need.

273
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,030
Leave it as usual.

274
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,670
It's already late.

275
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:58,790
Lord Liu,

276
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,840
let’s continue tomorrow.

277
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,280
Yes.

278
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,320
Please.

279
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,000
We aren’t exposed.

280
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,790
I'm sorry.

281
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,670
I was reckless.

282
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,790
I should be the one to apologize.

283
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,400
I didn’t know Luo Li is caught.

284
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,670
If I were you

285
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,230
and Qian’er were the one there,

286
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,910
I’d lose my calm, too.

287
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,110
You and Qian’er

288
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,670
are getting engaged, aren’t you?

289
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,400
Yes.

290
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,520
I should prepare gift money for you. Congrats!

291
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,840
She doesn’t even want to look at me

292
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,350
and she accuses me of helping the evil.

293
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,910
What happened?

294
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,520
We owe the Mus.

295
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,150
Liu Qingtian

296
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,670
is my father after all.

297
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,400
I can’t disobey him.

298
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:07,710
I'm sorry.

299
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,190
I can’t help you.

300
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,920
But to me,

301
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,710
you’ll always be my friend.

302
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,190
Take care.

303
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,190
Mother,

304
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,560
I swear

305
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,470
I’ll get back what we lost.

306
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,800
Stop!

307
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,400
Mubai, from now on,

308
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,710
I’ll take care of your meals.

309
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,800
Remember,

310
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,350
you can only eat what I give you.

311
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,680
Don’t eat anything else.

312
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,760
Liu Yang!

313
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:32,400
Lord Liu!

314
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,000
Lord Liu!

315
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,160
What happened to those soldiers and servants?

316
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,070
Qian'er and I...

317
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,560
Lord Tang,

318
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,830
don’t worry.

319
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,920
I've arranged meals

320
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,710
for you and your daughter.

321
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,160
Don't be afraid.

322
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,070
Relax.

323
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,430
Lord Liu!

324
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,040
Lord Liu!

325
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,280
Liu Qingtian caved so quickly.

326
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,640
How spineless!

327
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,040
Under this circumstance,

328
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,470
it’s unlikely

329
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,760
to proceed with your plan.

330
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,520
Those monsters

331
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,800
won’t have mercy on prisoners.

332
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,430
Mr. Tang,

333
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,680
the odds are against us

334
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,680
but there’s still hope.

335
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,160
My plan is still doable.

336
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,000
Those demonized soldiers

337
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,000
are unable to think.

338
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,110
That’s why they need a leader.

339
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,710
You still haven’t given up on Mubai?

340
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,710
I thought he already rejected you.

341
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,070
He did

342
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:40,680
but I still

343
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,520
have faith in him.

344
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,560
He’s loyal

345
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,000
so he can’t act against his father’s will.

346
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,000
I’m sure

347
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,920
he won’t sit and do nothing

348
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,110
and allow his clansmen

349
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,520
to become like that.

350
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,470
You must act fast.

351
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,830
We're surrounded by monsters.

352
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,310
Danger is lurking.

353
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,880
Mr. Tang,

354
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,880
I know what to do.

355
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,040
It’s just that

356
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,760
I need to do something else first.

357
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,160
Humans can be surprisingly intimidating.

358
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,040
That’s because of the Power of Whisper, isn’t it?

359
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:27,760
No-Face,

360
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,640
are you sure you can control them?

361
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,830
Rest assured.

362
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,680
They're like my puppies.

363
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,880
So, Mo Xingtian,

364
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,110
do you want to be blessed?

365
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,430
No, thanks.

366
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,190
That’s too much for me.

367
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:53,800
Luo Li!

368
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,760
Hang in there.

369
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,280
Luo Li!

370
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,310
Look at me.

371
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,280
Luo Li!

372
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:35,680
Mu Chen?

373
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,470
Forget about me.

374
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,110
Go now!

375
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,070
Luo Li!

376
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,590
I won't leave without you.

377
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:47,950
Luo Li.

378
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,280
It hurts, doesn’t it?

379
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,920
Once we’re back, you can hit me

380
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,680
till I’m as painful as you are now.

381
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:05,950
But now,

382
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,520
I have to get you out.

383
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,190
Where are you taking my Goddess?

384
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:33,950
Mu Chen,

385
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,470
there's no way out.

386
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,800
Just give in.

387
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,760
Jiuyou!

388
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,710
Mu Chen?

389
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,950
Impressive!

390
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,710
Let me have a try.

391
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,800
It’s right under my nose.

392
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,230
Mo Xingtian,

393
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,520
step back.

394
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,110
Mu Chen,

395
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,880
I’m surprised that you have a magic beast.

396
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,470
Interesting.

397
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,520
Jiuyou!

398
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,110
Don't bother.

399
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,230
My spell can drain all beings’ power.

400
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,430
It's perfect to tame your beast.

401
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,350
Mu Chen.

402
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,950
Leave without me.

403
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,400
No way.

404
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,520
I promised to protect you.

405
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,470
I won’t abandon you.

406
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,920
Kill him.

407
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,160
Wait!

408
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,070
Liu Mubai,

409
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,800
stay out of this.

410
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,000
Go back.

411
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:02,950
Mu Chen!

412
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,350
Mu Chen!

413
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:13,760
Mu Chen!

414
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,310
Mu Chen!

415
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,920
Mu Chen!

416
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,710
Young Master Liu

417
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,640
did an excellent job.

418
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,920
I’m shocked that you could kill him.

419
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,400
I’ve promised my father,

420
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,310
so I won’t go back on my word.

421
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:54,950
I eliminated

422
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,800
an enemy.

423
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,190
Well said.

424
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,430
I’m really impressed.

425
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,040
Guards!

426
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,640
Hang Mu Chen’s body up on the wall

427
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:07,680
for everyone to see.

428
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,040
Hold on.

429
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,110
Master,

430
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,400
may I make a request?

431
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,470
Although we’re on opposite sides

432
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,000
and anyone can die,

433
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:18,950
he and I

434
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,070
used to study together.

435
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,640
We were friends.

436
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,350
I want him to die with dignity.

437
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,280
Allow me to handle his body, Master.

438
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,680
Fine.

439
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,430
You’re a good friend.

440
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,710
I’ll grant your request.

441
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,920
Thank you, Master.

442
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,430
Mu Chen!

443
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,350
Mu Chen!

444
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,400
Wake up, Mu Chen.

445
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,310
Mu Chen!

446
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,470
Mu Chen!

447
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,560
He’s already dead.

448
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,680
Liu Mubai,

449
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,710
how could you do this?

450
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,000
We're in war.

451
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,230
He was an enemy.

452
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,590
I couldn’t have mercy on him.

453
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,520
Qian’er.

454
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,160
Mubai,

455
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,640
are you OK?

456
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,350
Why didn’t you dodge?

457
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:51,000
If hitting me can make you feel better,

458
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,640
I’m willing to bear the pain.

459
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:15,760
You saw Mu Chen’s body yourself?

460
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,110
I did.

461
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,830
I examined it myself.

462
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,760
He was stabbed deeply in the abdomen.

463
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,470
Then he stopped breathing and lost his pulse.

464
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,310
He couldn't be more dead.

465
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,230
You did well.

466
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,400
Thank you.

467
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,310
Now that, Mu Chen is out of the picture,

468
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,040
should we carry on the plan?

469
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,710
Qing Yanjing’s husband is still alive.

470
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,280
Wipe out the Mu Territory.

471
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,430
Don’t leave anyone out.

472
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,470
Yes.

473
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,400
Seeing your love dying in front of you

474
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:00,190
is painful, isn’t it?

475
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,190
Stop struggling.

476
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,590
You’ll soon be painless

477
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,760
and reunite with him.

478
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,040
Squads dispatched today

479
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,950
suffer a heavy loss.

480
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,640
Liu soldiers are acting strangely

481
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,070
as if they were monsters.

482
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,800
The Dragon Clan joins the battle, too.

483
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
If this continues,

484
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,680
we’ll soon collapse.

485
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,560
I was shocked, too,

486
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,520
so I tried to fish information out of the captive.

487
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:50,880
But...

488
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,280
What’s wrong?

489
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,310
See for yourself.

490
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,160
Bring him in.

491
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,680
Evil Deity...

492
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,560
This is Evil Deity's Power of Whisper.

493
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,640
It’s written in ancient books.

494
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,040
5,000 years ago, Evil Deity

495
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,110
used this power to manipulate the masses.

496
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:15,830
It seems that

497
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:19,110
all our theories are proven to be true.

498
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:19,800
Mu Feng,

499
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,520
we must win this war

500
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,160
and inform all other clans

501
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,830
that Evil Deity is back.

502
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,350
Lord!

503
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,590
What's wrong?

504
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,520
Young Master is...

505
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,950
Mr. Tang.

506
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,470
Mubai?

507
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,760
Why are you here?

508
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,520
I want to ask you the same thing.

509
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,430
Mu Feng and I are friends.

510
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,350
Mu Chen is his only child.

511
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,350
I want to bring his body back

512
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:18,040
so that his father can see him one last time.

513
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,230
Why didn’t you say that earlier?

514
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,760
I want to keep a low profile in front of

515
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,160
that Taoist in case of any trouble.

516
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,430
Alright.

517
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,040
Now, it’s your turn to tell me

518
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,430
why you’re here.

519
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:30,520
Mubai,

520
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,950
you don’t need to

521
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,110
hide anything from me.

522
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,880
I’m your father-in-law.

523
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,310
Mubai,

524
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:43,000
you must be here for a reason.

525
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,710
If you don’t believe me,

526
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,000
I’ll leave right now

527
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,800
and I won’t tell anyone

528
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,000
about our encounter here.

529
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,110
Mr. Tang,

530
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:55,880
you said you and Uncle Mu are friends.

531
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,350
Are you willing to

532
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,520
take risks for your friend?

533
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,040
Of course.

534
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:24,950
Chen!

535
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,430
Slowly.

536
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,560
Mubai,

537
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,400
that really hurts.

538
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,160
Since your first visit,

539
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,160
I’ve known

540
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,950
this would happen anytime,

541
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,040
so I brought Scorpion Poison with me.

542
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,800
This poison could stop your breathing

543
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,950
and slow down your heartbeat to once per hour.

544
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,590
You’d be like dead.

545
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,110
Hadn’t I stabbed you,

546
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,070
No-face Taoist wouldn’t have bought it.

547
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,430
So you two put on a show.

548
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,560
So,

549
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,560
can you take my offer now?

550
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,040
Mr. Tang was also aware of

551
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,520
me coming back to Mu Territory.

552
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:10,920
What?

553
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,160
In that case,

554
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,760
you brought up the engagement...

555
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,520
Exactly.

556
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:16,640
Mubai,

557
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,230
you're a good kid.

558
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,110
No matter what happens,

559
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,830
you’ll always be my son-in-law.

560
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,190
General Mo.

561
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,800
What is this?

562
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,070
My daughter and Mubai

563
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,230
will soon get engaged.

564
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,950
I’m preparing the dowry.

565
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,350
Lord Tang,

566
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,000
please don’t take it to heart.

567
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,520
In wartime,

568
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,000
we can’t be careful enough.

569
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:10,120
After all,

570
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,560
Mu Chen already sneaked in once.

571
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,560
I understand.

572
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,360
You don’t need to explain it.

573
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,320
Mubai.

574
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,080
Bear with it.

575
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,040
This is for your safety

576
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,040
and to avoid suspicion.

577
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,910
What’s your plan to take care of that Taoist?

578
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,710
What do you need me to do?

579
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,190
You said you wouldn’t help me, didn’t you?

580
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,840
Just let it go.

581
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,800
I acted against my conscience to help my father

582
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:49,000
only for the sake of Liu Territory,

583
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,670
but I made a mistake.

584
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,800
I regretted it.

585
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,840
Before I reveal my plan,

586
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,840
I have two things

587
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,910
to tell you first.

588
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,040
I’m listening.

589
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,520
First,

590
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,390
it’s true that I can purify

591
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,670
those men who’re possessed by the evil power.

592
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:11,630
However,

593
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,670
during the process,

594
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,360
an enormous amount of power

595
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,230
will be drained from their bodies.

596
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,760
I’m afraid few people

597
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,430
can handle that.

598
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,630
You mean

599
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,360
they’ll die?

600
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:27,600
100%?

601
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:30,190
Even if they’re free from Evil Deity’s control,

602
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,320
they can barely stay alive.

603
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,520
Right now,

604
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,560
they’re merely a bunch of walking dead

605
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,080
with no spirit

606
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:44,870
or dignity.

607
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,320
They’ve become demonized

608
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,910
murder weapons.

609
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,430
I’ll take it.

610
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,040
Fine.

611
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,670
Second one

612
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,630
is the poison in your body.

613
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:04,000
Not a big deal.

614
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,040
My people’s lives are on the line.

615
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,280
Mine doesn’t matter.

616
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,840
It might not matter to you,

617
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:11,080
but it does to others.

618
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,320
Think about your father

619
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,430
and Qian’er.

620
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,600
To accomplish one thing

621
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,630
means to sacrifice others.

622
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,320
My father owes you.

623
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,430
I'm his son,

624
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,430
so I’ll repay his debt.

625
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,800
Liu Mubai!

626
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,600
Mu Chen,

627
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,800
you’re too soft-hearted, you know?

628
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,040
If our positions switched,

629
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,710
you might not be able to

630
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,430
stab me.

631
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:46,910
Guess we’ve reached a consensus.

632
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:48,560
So,

633
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,910
what’s your plan?

634
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,950
Nothing new yet?

635
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,950
Still haven’t found Chen’s body?

636
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,560
Not yet.

637
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,520
There’s nothing new.

638
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,800
No body?

639
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,080
Then Chen is still alive!

640
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:15,870
Lord Mu.

641
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,360
Lord Mu.

642
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,040
Lord Mu.

643
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,390
Lord Tang’s letter.

644
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,230
Chen is still alive!

645
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:41,150
There’s another great news.

646
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,760
Zhou Ye,

647
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,470
gather the force.

648
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,120
It’s time to set out.

649
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,080
Yes.

650
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,870
Jiuyou!

651
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,520
Jiuyou!

652
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,560
Jiuyou!

653
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,000
Jiuyou!

654
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:09,840
I’m here.

655
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,120
You scared me to death.

656
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,670
I was looking for you everywhere.

657
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,150
I was asleep.

658
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:16,120
What's with the fuss?

659
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,000
That No-Face Taoist

660
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,630
took out all my power.

661
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,910
His spell

662
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,150
can suppress us easily.

663
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:26,040
You're too weak.

664
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:26,870
Yeah.

665
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,190
I’ll take it over from here.

666
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:30,840
You can go back and rest.

667
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,360
What will you do?

668
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,560
I’ll practice the Desolate Formation.

669
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,360
Luo Li is still in that Taoist’s hands.

670
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,800
Our fight is inevitable.

671
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,360
His spell surpasses ours,

672
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,870
but I can adopt another method.

673
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,000
Problem is

674
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,390
the Desolate Formation

675
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,320
can harm the enemy

676
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:46,470
as well as the formation builder.

677
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,910
I don’t want to

678
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,560
see you get hurt, too.

679
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,430
I’d rather die with him

680
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,600
than being killed by him.

681
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,360
Even if I asked you to abandon Luo Li,

682
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,840
would you agree?

683
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:01,950
Jiuyou,

684
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,040
thank you.

685
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:54,150
Mubai,

686
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:58,630
this time, you don’t need to join the battle.

687
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:01,600
Got it?

688
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,470
Father,

689
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,390
this is our battle.

690
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,080
I can’t hide behind others.
