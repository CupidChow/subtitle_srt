1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,590
Headmaster.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,320
Come in.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:11,720
Headmaster.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,030
Mu Chen is in trouble.

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:13,880
What?

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,950
Greetings, Headmaster.

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,680
Headmaster.

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,520
His power is turbulent.

10
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,790
I can’t soothe it.

11
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,110
Mu Chen.

12
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,470
How do you feel?

13
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,470
What are you doing here?

14
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,270
You are...

15
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,950
This is Ling Xi, the Headmaster.

16
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:09,870
I sensed

17
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,590
dark red power

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,590
flowing in your vines.

19
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,830
It is of great violence

20
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,800
and may affect your mind.

21
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,160
What’s going on?

22
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,039
Your eyes

23
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:26,590
have recovered?

24
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,039
He Yao cured my eyes,

25
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,720
yet Luo Li seems to be mad at me.

26
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,160
Don’t worry, Mu Chen.

27
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,550
She will surely understand you.

28
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,759
Jiuyou doesn’t seem well either.

29
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,400
Is she

30
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,759
also affected?

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,080
She’s fine for now.

32
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,120
I’ve subdued her.

33
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:49,160
Come with me.

34
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,820
The Great Ruler

35
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,700
Episode 18

36
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,190
Headmaster.

37
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,160
I’m sorry

38
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,520
for what happened.

39
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:32,079
I...

40
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,630
You could

41
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,079
have been my exclusive disciple.

42
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,550
I didn’t know

43
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,720
you are the headmaster back then.

44
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,240
You know it now.

45
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,440
Would you like to be my disciple?

46
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,320
I’ve seen you as my master

47
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,520
since you taught me the combination formations.

48
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:52,390
Did He Yao really cure your eyes?

49
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,470
The dark red power

50
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,750
must have something to do with the cure.

51
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:59,910
Even Jiuyou is influenced by it.

52
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,830
Seems that it has great side effects.

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,600
Mr. He Yao told me specifically

54
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,160
I was struck by Xue God Clan’s Dark Blood Spell.

55
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,160
Though I can see now,

56
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,550
there’s still residual poison.

57
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,600
He hopes I can

58
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,670
receive further treatment there for some time.

59
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,920
He Yao

60
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,829
has no taboos in research and always takes risks.

61
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,880
I advise you

62
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,350
not to receive his treatment anymore.

63
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,000
Headmaster.

64
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,880
How is Jiuyou?

65
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,880
Jiuyou was attacked by you abruptly

66
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,600
and was frightened.

67
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,230
Is she in danger?

68
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,159
But it’s hard for her to regain consciousness.

69
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,440
Now that you share the veins,

70
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,070
you may wake her up.

71
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,480
This is a psychic spell.

72
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:56,670
The cultivation can increase

73
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,600
your Power.

74
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,880
And she doesn’t have to be confined in your body.

75
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,040
Troubles like this can be avoided.

76
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,950
Thank you, Headmaster.

77
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,720
Jiuyou.

78
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,790
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,070
Jiuyou.

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,070
It's me.

81
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,390
I am Mu Chen.

82
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,880
I won’t hurt you again.

83
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,790
You don’t need to eat in the Futu Pagoda.

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,350
Why still feel hungry?

85
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,880
Jiuyou.

86
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,160
Don't be afraid.

87
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,390
Give me your hand.

88
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,160
Jiuyou.

89
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,110
Trust me.

90
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,440
Close your eyes.

91
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,000
Jiuyou.

92
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,510
It still can’t succeed at one go.

93
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,350
Back then,

94
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,110
I used to think you are noisy.

95
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,600
Now you are so quiet,

96
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,640
all because I hurt you.

97
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,640
Jiuyou.

98
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,070
You become like this

99
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,790
because of the cure of my eyes.

100
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,320
I’ll have you recovered as soon as possible.

101
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,550
Excuse me. Have you seen Luo Li?

102
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
No, I haven’t seen her since yesterday.

103
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,510
Bravo!

104
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,110
Luo Li!

105
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,110
Luo Li!

106
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,790
Luo Li!

107
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:49,760
Where are you?

108
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,480
Mu Chen.

109
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:58,920
Don't be afraid.

110
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,670
After I learn the psychic spell,

111
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,000
you can be recovered.

112
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,760
Then you can go anywhere you want,

113
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,760
and won’t be trapped here.

114
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,400
Finally, I’m out!

115
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,280
It’s so boring

116
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,000
in the Futu Pagoda.

117
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,760
Jiuyou.

118
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,910
Great!

119
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,470
What’s wrong with you?

120
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,590
You didn’t show up.

121
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,590
I had no one to talk to.

122
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,470
That's a small place.

123
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,320
I couldn’t even fly freely.

124
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,550
Aren't you happy for me?

125
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,960
Of course I am.

126
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,030
It’s just that I don’t see Luo Li today.

127
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,230
Jiuyou.

128
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,080
With your speed, it’s easy

129
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,400
for you to find her, right?

130
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,350
You don’t see her just for one day

131
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,960
and you’re so anxious.

132
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,520
Of course I am.

133
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,080
She hasn’t shown up for a day.

134
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,960
It’s a piece of cake for me.

135
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,710
Give me a reason to help you.

136
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,840
I owe her an apology.

137
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,320
Alright.

138
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,670
You owe me one then.

139
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,280
Did I see it wrong?

140
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,960
Where did Luo Li go?

141
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,840
How could I promise Mu Chen to

142
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,400
look for her?

143
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,520
Never mind.

144
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,320
Anyway, I’m free now.

145
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,350
How many men did Black Dragon send over?

146
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,110
What is he up to?

147
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,280
I’ll say.

148
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:37,960
I’ll say.

149
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,960
Lord Mo Xingtian led men himself and meant to

150
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,000
to raid the North Sect when the Protective Circle

151
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,110
disappeared.

152
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,880
Unexpectedly, the barrier was restored so soon.

153
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,350
Mo Xingtian?

154
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,910
You disguised as locals.

155
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:56,910
What are you up to?

156
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,640
I do not know.

157
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,150
To turn people into Dragon Clan’s puppets

158
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,350
and use them as leverage.

159
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,760
I’m just a pawn.

160
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,670
That’s all I know.

161
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,400
Please spare me.

162
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,710
Shen.

163
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,550
If I am correct,

164
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,960
they disguised as locals

165
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,790
to force us to open the barrier by using locals.

166
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:31,910
It makes sense.

167
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:36,080
Seems that we need to go back

168
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,760
and tell Headmaster Ling Xi.

169
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,030
Lord.

170
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,910
How did it go?

171
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,110
My men

172
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,030
have been caught by Shen Cangsheng.

173
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,350
I’m sure they’ve known

174
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,670
we’ll use those people as leverage.

175
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,840
Well done.

176
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,150
I don’t believe

177
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,230
they can still sit and do nothing.

178
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,230
It’s weird.

179
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,710
The Dragon Roc List turns dark red.

180
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,030
It means someone entered Lei Territory.

181
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,470
Unbelievable! Someone in North Sect

182
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,150
made it to do trials there.

183
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,670
Tons of power points

184
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,790
are required to access Lei Territory.

185
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,790
Their power points change so fast.

186
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,320
I wonder how far they’ve gone inside.

187
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,280
It’s Lei Territory.

188
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,030
Even if you do nothing,

189
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,000
your power points will surge.

190
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,150
This is

191
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,880
Wooden Ball!

192
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,470
Wooden Balls

193
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,960
are indispensable treasures

194
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,080
for space formations.

195
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,840
How come they exist here?

196
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,670
The attributes of Wooden Balls

197
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,080
are against this place.

198
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,640
It couldn’t appear here for no reason.

199
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,110
You mean

200
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,440
someone deliberately put it...

201
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,230
Let's go.

202
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,710
Sir.

203
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,350
Did anyone enter Lei Territory yesterday?

204
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,230
Yes,

205
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,030
a girl named Luo Li.

206
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,320
Tons of power points are required to go there.

207
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,670
How did she get that many points?

208
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,320
She pawned her sword.

209
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,470
Do you mean Luo God Sword?

210
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,080
Yes.

211
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,030
How could it be?

212
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,640
How many power points is it worth?

213
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,320
The texture is smooth.

214
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,520
It’s worth 200.

215
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,840
How many power points

216
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,150
do I need to redeem Luo God Sword?

217
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,150
Not much.

218
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,030
16,000.

219
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,760
I knew you’d come here

220
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,880
once I saw Dragon Roc List.

221
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,760
Did Luo Li...

222
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,960
She came to look for Jade Knots.

223
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,840
How many power points

224
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,320
are needed to go there?

225
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,590
Yours and mine

226
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,400
are not enough, right?

227
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:30,880
Mu Chen.

228
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,470
Come with me.

229
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,470
I heard that

230
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,710
the entrance to Lei Territory

231
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,590
is right at the cloister.

232
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,000
But we pass by the cloister every day for classes.

233
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,350
Nothing seems weird.

234
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,590
How can you know without a try?

235
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,910
Anyway,

236
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,030
we can’t think up other ways to go.

237
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,150
Are you a pig?

238
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,710
Jiuyou.

239
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,910
You ignored me.

240
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,840
I won’t help you look for the entrance.

241
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,150
Can this bird talk?

242
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,350
Is it a demon?

243
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,150
Mu Chen.

244
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,790
Where did you get it?

245
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,230
You are a demon.

246
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,110
That’s insulting.

247
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,710
That’s Jiuyou Bird.

248
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:24,960
You saw it before.

249
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,110
Jiuyou Bird?

250
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,590
The one who trapped me during the exam...

251
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,440
Keep your voice down.

252
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,200
Don't worry.

253
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,080
I’ve connected my veins with hers.

254
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,520
Vein connection?

255
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,710
When did that happen?

256
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,230
You hide things from me again.

257
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,520
Qingshan.

258
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,590
Qingshan.

259
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,520
Do me another favor.

260
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,320
Only you can help me.

261
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,640
What is it?

262
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,790
Tan Qingshan.

263
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,150
Ms. Ye.

264
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,760
What’s the matter?

265
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,670
Ms. Ye. Drink it.

266
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,440
Why are you so attentive today?

267
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,200
I just want to chat with you.

268
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,710
I’m patrolling.

269
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,550
I’m occupied.

270
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,030
Wait, Ms. Ye.

271
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,320
I’d like to ask you

272
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,710
about North Sect’s history.

273
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,880
History?

274
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,470
What do you want to know?

275
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,280
For example, when was our school established?

276
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,710
By whom?

277
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,960
I want to know about it.

278
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,320
How come you’re interested in these?

279
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,760
Ms. Ye.

280
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,440
I don't read much.

281
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,150
Please tell me.

282
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:40,880
Alright.

283
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,840
The time when it was established is unknown,

284
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,760
but it’s been around for thousands of years.

285
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,080
The founder’s name

286
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,470
is lost in time.

287
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,520
Well,

288
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,350
why was it built on Mount Beicang?

289
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,110
Mount Beicang is filled

290
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,710
with power.

291
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,790
It’s beneficial to cultivation,

292
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,880
especially its main peak.

293
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,069
That’s why

294
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,230
it was built here.

295
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,400
Who created that Dragon Roc List?

296
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:15,069
Our sect’s guardian beast is

297
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,589
North Sea Dragon Roc, 5,000 years old at least.

298
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,000
It protected

299
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,470
our sect many times in the past.

300
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,069
The Dragon Roc List was created

301
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,680
to commemorate North Sea Dragon Roc.

302
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,680
It guards

303
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,920
the forbidden area of the North Sect,

304
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,069
Lei Territory.

305
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:28,230
Lei Territory?

306
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,760
Is it done?

307
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,310
I’m leaving.

308
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,280
Ms. Ye.

309
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,350
One more question.

310
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,680
Tons of power points

311
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,350
are required to enter Lei Territory. Why?

312
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,000
In fact,

313
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,070
it didn’t require so many points

314
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,760
to enter Lei Territory hundreds of years ago.

315
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,560
According to the record,

316
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,430
only 8,000 were needed,

317
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,760
until

318
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,520
dozens of top students once entered

319
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,520
but died there.

320
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,040
For the safety of students,

321
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,710
it was raised to 18,000 power points.

322
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,160
I see.

323
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,350
Lei Territory is awesome.

324
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,110
There’s more than one way

325
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,520
to access it, right?

326
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,760
Of course.

327
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,160
In addition to exchanging points for the key,

328
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,000
my sister and I...

329
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,040
Why do you ask that?

330
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,640
Nothing.

331
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,710
I'm just curious.

332
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,040
Don’t worry, Ms. Ye.

333
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,070
I’m still young.

334
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,160
I won’t take any risks.

335
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,590
Do you have any plot?

336
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,400
Don’t lie to me.

337
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,230
How could I lie to you?

338
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,830
That’s confidential.

339
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,560
Do not tell others.

340
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:36,800
Is that all?

341
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,430
Yes. Yes.

342
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,590
I’m leaving.

343
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,350
Ms. Ye.

344
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,350
Why do you

345
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,830
come back so soon this time?

346
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,760
We got the news

347
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,160
Mo Xingtian’s left Dragon Palace.

348
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,760
Dragon slaves may have mingled with the locals.

349
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,590
It’s urgent.

350
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,800
Let’s go.

351
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,710
How was it going about Mu Chen?

352
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,110
It will succeed soon.

353
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,230
Don't let me down.

354
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,830
Besides,

355
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,000
build teleporting formation in North Sect ASAP.

356
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,400
Teleporting formation?

357
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,590
I’ll send men to sneak in

358
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,040
and work with you.

359
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,230
Take the North Sect at one strike,

360
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,760
and give all people’s power in North Sect

361
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,800
to my godfather.

362
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,710
But

363
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,310
the barrier in North Sect has been fully sealed.

364
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,950
About the Space Stone’s secondary stone...

365
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,760
Any problem?

366
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,350
Rest assured, lord.

367
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,520
I’ll do it properly.

368
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,470
You better be.

369
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,470
Sir.

370
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,430
Come in.

371
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,430
Sir.

372
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,000
Mhmm.

373
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,310
Luo Li has entered Lei Territory.

374
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,640
What about Mu Chen?

375
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,070
He meant to enter Lei Territory too,

376
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,640
but he didn’t have enough power points.

377
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,310
Good.

378
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,110
One less troublemaker.

379
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,350
It’s good for us.

380
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,920
I also found another thing.

381
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,640
A student can come in and out North Sect

382
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,310
with Shen Cangsheng.

383
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,040
Who is it?

384
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,400
If I’m correct,

385
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,760
it is Liu Mubai.

386
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,880
Liu Mubai?

387
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,190
Headmaster.

388
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,470
I don't understand.

389
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,880
Why not just blockade Lei Territory?

390
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,310
Lei Territory is dangerous indeed,

391
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,950
while there are also opportunities with danger.

392
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,280
They managed to get enough power points

393
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,000
for the entrance pass.

394
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,110
That’s their fate and opportunity.

395
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,350
Moreover,

396
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,190
the cultivation is about fight for survival.

397
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,430
But

398
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,160
if others also enter Lei Territory

399
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,160
as Luo Li did by power points exchange,

400
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,470
that would be too dangerous.

401
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,350
She may have her own reason

402
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,520
to pawn the Luo God Sword.

403
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,350
Not all students have

404
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,800
that kind of divine weapon.

405
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,760
Others can hardly enter Lei Territory

406
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,280
by this way.

407
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,430
Headmaster.

408
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,040
Come in.

409
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:40,920
You are back.

410
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,350
Headmaster.

411
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,830
Seems that the second badge I gave you

412
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,640
came in handy.

413
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,560
This is Liu Mubai.

414
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,310
He’s as talented as me.

415
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,920
Moreover,

416
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,470
he is adept in formations.

417
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,880
Greetings, Headmaster.

418
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:04,830
You are excellent.

419
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,000
What news

420
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,640
do you have?

421
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,070
Black Dragon sent Mo Xingtian

422
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,560
and dragon slaves to the North Sect

423
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,560
and plotted to invade.

424
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,040
Dragon slaves has mixed in the locals.

425
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,110
Dragon Clan is strong by nature.

426
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,310
Even the dragon slaves

427
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,880
are more powerful than human beings.

428
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,830
If they intend to

429
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,560
harm the people in the towns nearby,

430
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,190
we can hardly stop them.

431
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,400
I’ve studied Beicang Formation for years.

432
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,400
It’ll draw to a close soon.

433
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:38,430
We may turn the tide at that time.

434
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,110
I’ll count on you

435
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,310
to protect people while the formation is built.

436
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,040
Consider it done.

437
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:46,950
Headmaster.

438
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,880
With the Protection Circle,

439
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,430
Black Dragon can’t break into North Sect easily.

440
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,590
Meanwhile,

441
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,800
the Dragon Palace must be vulnerable now.

442
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,560
It’s the best time to get intelligence there.

443
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,680
Shen and I

444
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,590
can go ask about information.

445
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,590
I have no objection to your proposal,

446
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:05,590
but safety first.

447
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,040
Do not act rashly.

448
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:07,880
Rest assured, Headmaster.

449
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,830
Seems that I underestimated Lei Territory.

450
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,040
We have to find a way out first.

451
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,560
No.

452
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,590
Find the Jade Knot first.

453
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,760
Since it’s a maze,

454
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,950
it must have a rule.

455
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,160
Is it the exit?

456
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,640
Xuantong!

457
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,000
Brat, I’m done playing with you.

458
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,800
Geezer, let go of Goddess!

459
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,430
Goddess!

460
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,680
It isn’t here.

461
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,680
It’s said the entrance to Lei Territory

462
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:32,830
is near here.

463
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,160
Wait.

464
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,520
The entrance seems to be here.

465
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:38,880
No!

466
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:40,430
Mu Chen. Listen to me...

467
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,520
You may strike and have a try.

468
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,000
If the entrance is here,

469
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,110
it can be found very soon.

470
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,430
Listen to me first.

471
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,280
You have a point.

472
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:47,830
You do it.

473
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,230
Me?

474
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,590
I won’t.

475
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,710
I’ll be confined for vandalism.

476
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,620
What is Jiuyou doing?

477
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,800
It's here.

478
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,710
Come and have a look. Alright?

479
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,310
The power is extremely weak here.

480
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,830
It can hardly be found.

481
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:25,830
Jiuyou.

482
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,430
How did you find it?

483
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,000
I once told you

484
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,680
there’s a mysterious place in North Sect.

485
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,640
Here?

486
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,160
Why not tell me earlier?

487
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,160
I’ve been trying to tell you.

488
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,190
Jiuyou, be good.

489
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,310
Don’t make trouble.

490
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,470
There are

491
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,280
power bans in the gate.

492
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,950
Only special power can open it.

493
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:56,000
And these bans are hard to discover.

494
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:58,280
This is it.

495
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,280
I can’t believe there’s really another way

496
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,190
to enter Lei Territory besides the pass.

497
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,950
The bans are extraordinary.

498
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,680
How can you get in so casually?

499
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,680
I wonder

500
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,400
how Luo Li is now inside.

501
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,070
Step back.

502
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,520
I’ll try to break the ban.

503
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,160
Let‘s rest for a few hours first.

504
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,560
Prepare what we need.

505
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,040
It’s the cloister!

506
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:36,430
Let's go.

507
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,230
Who is it?

508
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:48,920
Mu Chen.

509
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,880
Shen.

510
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,350
Mubai.

511
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,640
You're back.

512
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,800
Your eyes...

513
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,230
Long time no see.

514
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:58,430
Mubai.

515
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,830
You can see?

516
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,760
Great!

517
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,190
Shen, thanks for your concern.

518
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,560
What are you doing?

519
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,640
Luo Li entered Lei Territory.

520
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,000
I want to get her out.

521
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:15,680
Ridiculous.

522
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,280
Lei Territory is

523
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,350
extremely dangerous.

524
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,560
To prevent students from entering it,

525
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,230
Headmaster set high power points.

526
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,560
Luo Li’s a freshman. How did she get

527
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,430
so many points in half a year?

528
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:36,110
She pawned Luo God Sword for the pass.

529
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,040
I won’t let her be in danger.

530
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,280
What do you want to do?

531
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,800
I’m going to save her.

532
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,190
You sure?

533
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,190
Even I am not sure

534
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,950
if I could come out intact.

535
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,950
I’m willing to die for her.

536
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,190
To cure my eyes, Luo Li

537
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,000
risked her life in Lei Territory to get Jade Knot.

538
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,520
I can’t let her get in danger.

539
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,000
You have a point.

540
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,110
Though you can get in Lei Territory through it,

541
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,760
you are definitely unable to break the ban.

542
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:19,830
According to my knowledge,

543
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,710
other than the entrance pass,

544
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,590
Ye Sun’er and her sister have

545
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,160
a jade pendant

546
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,190
to access there.

547
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:29,880
Shen.

548
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,590
Many thanks, Shen.

549
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,520
Mubai,

550
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,880
don’t stop me.

551
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,000
If Qian’er did this for you,

552
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,310
I’m sure you’d do it too.

553
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:44,560
Mu Chen.

554
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,830
Lei Territory is dangerous.

555
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,230
I haven’t been there either.

556
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,880
I can’t give you more advice.

557
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,040
Be very careful.

558
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,560
Thank you, Shen.

559
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,190
I’m grateful.

560
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,310
Take care.

561
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,800
Be careful.

562
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,190
I will.

563
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,710
Thanks.

564
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,560
Mubai,

565
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,040
You're back.

566
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,800
How long

567
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,830
have you been waiting here?

568
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,590
Finally, you’re talking to me again!

569
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,470
Thank you, Qian’er.

570
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,710
Me again?

571
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,000
My eyes haven’t fully recovered yet.

572
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,160
I can’t find it

573
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,430
even if I go.

574
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,310
Alright.

575
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,880
But you have to watch it for me.

576
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,760
Rest assured.

577
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,710
Greetings, Ms. Ye.

578
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,920
OK. Got it.

579
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,710
Man.

580
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,430
I told you to watch for people!

581
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:54,280
You weren’t exposed anyway.

582
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,040
I couldn’t stop her

583
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,280
going home, right?

584
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,040
And

585
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,350
I also prayed

586
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,070
for you.

587
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,800
She almost found me.

588
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,680
Who’d know she’d be back to get changed?

589
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,280
Oh, right.

590
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,400
I found something troublesome.

591
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,040
What?

592
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,400
She always takes

593
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,760
the jade pendant with her.

594
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,160
That’s troublesome indeed.

595
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,110
Why are you staring at me?

596
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,430
We don't have much time.

597
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,920
We have to steal the pendant now.

598
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,040
Yes.

599
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,560
But how?

600
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,830
I have you.

601
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,160
Me again?

602
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:41,830
Mu Chen.

603
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,280
To be blunt,

604
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:45,070
had Ms. Ye seen me just now,

605
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:45,470
I would have...

606
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,000
Qingshan.

607
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,710
It’s an opportunity for you.

608
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,710
Look.

609
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:51,190
Among all the freshmen,

610
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,560
Ms. Ye favors you the most.

611
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,190
Given your relationship,

612
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:55,880
it’s easy

613
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,160
for you to get it.

614
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,560
We’ve been friends

615
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,830
since little.

616
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,590
You treat me like this?

617
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,520
Qingshan.

618
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,800
Listen to me.

619
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,070
Look.

620
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,950
Can I help you?

621
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,800
How much is the Illusion Vetch?

622
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:21,640
300 power points

623
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,430
or a Formation-broken Pill.

624
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:23,880
Buddy.

625
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,710
Are you kidding me?

626
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,230
It’s too expensive.

627
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,230
Not at all.

628
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,160
It blooms every 60 years.

629
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,430
It’s worth more than 10,000 gold outside.

630
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:32,800
30 power points.

631
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:33,430
Deal?

632
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,190
Take it

633
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,350
or leave it.

634
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,350
80.

635
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:37,350
Is it enough?

636
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,190
At lease 270.

637
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,280
250.

638
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,110
Deal, or I’ll leave.

639
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:44,710
Fine.

640
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,760
Deal.

641
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,800
Ms. Ye Sun’er!

642
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,760
Ms. Ye.

643
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,520
It’s for you.

644
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,360
It’s beautiful.

645
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,190
Ms. Ye.

646
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,389
I picked this flower especially for you.

647
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,320
Don’t you think it’s as gorgeous as you?

648
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:17,280
Take it.

649
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,429
Ms. Ye.

650
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,190
Don’t let my efforts go in vain.

651
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,190
Please take it.

652
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:22,670
Ms. Ye.

653
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,190
Take it.

654
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,120
It suits you well.

655
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,080
Are you so cruel

656
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,389
to abandon this adorable flower?

657
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:30,230
Ms. Ye. Please take it.

658
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:32,469
It hurts!

659
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,560
Tan Qingshan.

660
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,000
You obstruct my patrol.

661
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,000
You’ll be punished.

662
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:40,280
What happened?

663
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,600
Ms. Ye. Please take it.

664
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,360
Let me go.

665
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:49,000
Ms. Ye. It cost a lot.

666
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,520
Take it, or it’ll be a waste.

667
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,600
Ms. Ye, come on.

668
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,670
Let me go.

669
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,840
Tan Qingshan.

670
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:54,909
What are you doing?

671
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,840
Alright, I won’t bother you.

672
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,320
Wait!

673
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,230
Tan Qingshan.

674
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,840
You obstructed my patrol.

675
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:05,150
Transcribe books for seven days as a punishment.

676
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:06,910
Ms. Ye.

677
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,520
I didn't mean it.

678
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,080
Ms. Ye.

679
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:12,840
Ms. Ye.

680
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,190
Ms. Ye.

681
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,390
Jiuyou.

682
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,910
Can you fly up

683
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,080
and check it for me?

684
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,080
Sure.

685
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,150
Leave it to me.

686
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,950
Mu Chen.

687
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,560
The maze’s walls are constantly moving.

688
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,430
And it’s filled with thunder above.

689
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,120
Don’t worry.

690
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,190
Just follow me.

691
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:26,910
OK.

692
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,710
The maze’s center is ever-changing.

693
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,390
I’m afraid

694
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,520
it’ll be more dangerous inside.

695
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,630
I wonder how Luo Li is now.

696
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,670
Never mind.

697
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,360
Now that we’ve been here,

698
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,360
I must find her.

699
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:14,150
Mu Chen.

700
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,040
Come this way.

701
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,150
Mu Chen.

702
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,470
Why aren’t you moving?

703
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,470
Are you out of your mind?

704
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:14,670
Jiuyou.

705
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,320
Guide me.

706
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,360
What did you say?

707
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,800
I can’t see again.

708
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,150
How could it be?

709
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,230
I knew that He Yao was unreliable.

710
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:24,710
Say no more.

711
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,080
I’m used to being blind.

712
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,430
Let’s go.

713
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,150
Alright.

714
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,320
Go straight.

715
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:32,840
Turn right.

716
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,470
Continue.

717
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,430
Turn left.

718
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,390
Go forward.

719
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,080
Forward.

720
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,360
Go forward.

721
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:51,710
Run, Mu Chen!

722
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,520
Watch out!

723
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:02,520
Jiuyou.

724
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:03,910
What’s wrong?

725
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,800
Nothing.

726
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,470
Let’s move forward.

727
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:08,710
Let's go.

728
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,360
Hurry up.

729
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,560
Go forward.

730
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:14,000
To the right a little bit.

731
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,870
Yes. Move forward now.

732
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,040
Ms. Ye.

733
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,950
My senior said he wrote you

734
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,150
in his book.

735
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:21,470
Right.

736
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,040
The cake I ate yesterday

737
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,560
was made of Qiyou Flower.

738
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,390
It’s sweet and refreshing.

739
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,360
Very tasty.

740
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,560
Also,

741
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:30,080
a girl developed a kind of face cream.

742
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,320
When applied,

743
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,430
the skin will glow.

744
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,520
You want to try it?

745
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,390
Hey.

746
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,040
How come you care about these things?

747
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,520
Say one more word,

748
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,800
and transcribe books for ten days.

749
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,870
Ten days?

750
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,560
Ms. Ye.

751
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,000
Ms. Ye.

752
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,950
Well...

753
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,040
How come

754
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,430
Mu Chen’s power points rise so fast?

755
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,320
Is he doing trials there?

756
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,040
This flower is very expensive.

757
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,630
Take it, or it’ll be a waste.

758
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,910
Ms. Ye, come on.

759
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,870
Tan Qingshan.

760
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,630
Did you steal it?

761
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,760
Not me!

762
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:23,190
Look, there’s nothing in it.

763
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,120
Where is Mu Chen?

764
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,710
He is...

765
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,760
You guys are so ridiculous.

766
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,520
You are playing with fire.

767
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,080
You’ll be confined for ten days.

768
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:36,950
Reflect on yourself.

769
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,520
Shen.

770
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,120
Shen.

771
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,910
Shen.

772
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,710
Please help me.

773
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,390
Ms. Ye’ll confine me for ten days.

774
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,320
I’m surprised that he did enter Lei Territory.

775
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:58,600
You also knew that?

776
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,000
He went there to find Luo Li.

777
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,360
Too bad

778
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,280
I still have to wipe out all dragon slaves,

779
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,470
otherwise, I’d go with him

780
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,800
to explore that territory.
