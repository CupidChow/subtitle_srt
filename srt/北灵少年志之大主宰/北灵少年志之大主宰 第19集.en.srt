1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available.]


2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,960
I’m surprised that he did enter Lei Territory.


3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,600
You also knew that?


4
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:17,760
He went there to find Luo Li.


5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,070
Too bad


6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,840
I still have to wipe out all dragon slaves,


7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,310
otherwise, I’d go with him


8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,790
to explore that territory.


9
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:25,870
I’m sure you know


10
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,470
it’s a danger zone.


11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,520
How could you approve it?


12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,080
He just did what a man should do.


13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,840
How is that wrong?


14
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:35,520
Well...


15
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,400
Do you have anything to do with that jade pendant?


16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,750
You...


17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,360
You’re ridiculous!


18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,400
Sun'er...


19
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,000
Shut up.


20
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:51,680
Alright.


21
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,240
Relax.


22
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,720
I’m sure Mu Chen can come out alive.


23
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,200
You should have faith in him.


24
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:02,430
You...


25
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,800
Sun'er...


26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,440
Come with me.


27
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,760
Be gentle.


28
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,080
Sun'er,


29
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,480
stop crying.


30
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,440
I’m being punished. Why are you crying?


31
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,479
Over the past three years,


32
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:34,590
I haven’t made a single mistake.


33
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,720
I’m so embarrassed.


34
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,270
I stole your jade pendant.


35
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,680
Why are you embarrassed?


36
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,479
You...


37
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,000
Don’t you know what it’s for?


38
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:46,360
Teachers entrusted it to me.


39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,630
What should I tell them?


40
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:50,910
Tan Qingshan,


41
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,190
stealing from schoolmates is a crime.


42
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,910
Stealing from the sect is a felony.


43
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,000
Your crimes combined...


44
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,680
Wait.


45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,160
Let me finish first.


46
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,509
I’ll be at your disposal


47
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:00,360
after that.


48
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:00,910
Fine.


49
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,310
Go on.


50
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,870
Luo Li fought tirelessly to gain power points.


51
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,669
You asked me not to tell Mu Chen


52
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,800
and said since she made that decision,


53
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,910
she was fully aware of the risks and consequences.


54
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,750
You also said since we couldn’t stop her,


55
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,440
we should at least give her a hand.


56
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,160
Yes.


57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I did say that.


58
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,390
OK.


59
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,190
Mu Chen is similar to her.


60
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,630
After he knew Luo Li entered Lei Territory,


61
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,440
he followed her regardless of the risks.


62
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:29,960
He also knew the consequences.


63
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,190
As his friends,


64
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,880
shouldn’t we help him?


65
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:36,270
I...


66
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,190
Stealing your pendant


67
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,270
is wrong.


68
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,600
But...


69
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,550
since I couldn’t stop him,


70
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,520
all I could do was to help him.


71
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,160
Isn’t that


72
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,440
what you taught me?


73
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:48,670
You...


74
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:52,880
Sun'er,


75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,320
no more crying.


76
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,470
How about this?


77
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,440
I’ll take full responsibility.


78
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,630
It’s all my fault.


79
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,880
You can


80
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,720
pass the buck to me.


81
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:02,800
Fine.


82
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,080
You have a point.


83
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,880
But you’ll be in detention


84
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,030
for 10 days.


85
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,720
Sun'er.


86
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,470
When can I put this down?


87
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:44,940
The Great Ruler


88
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,900
Episode 19


89
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,040
I’m leaving.


90
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,950
I’ll be back soon.


91
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,790
I know.


92
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,270
Alright.


93
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,160
Let's go.


94
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,880
Sir.


95
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,230
Mu Chen


96
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,390
is in Lei Territory.


97
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,760
What?


98
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,830
It’s dangerous there.


99
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,200
He won’t come back alive.


100
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,070
You good-for-nothing!


101
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,920
If I wanted him dead,


102
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,670
why would I keep him for so long?


103
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,350
How’s everything going?


104
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,760
Where’s Mu Chen?


105
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,270
He’s in Lei Territory.


106
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,070
Lei Territory?


107
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,000
Herbal Jade Knot there


108
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,070
can cure his eyes.


109
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,950
Useless!


110
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,070
My lady,


111
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,159
Lei Territory is a maze


112
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,230
equipped with weapons and traps.


113
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,720
Since the North Sect opened,


114
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,040
nobody has made it out alive.


115
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,880
Mu Chen


116
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,000
is probably...


117
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,200
What's the status of the teleporting formation?


118
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,320
It’s...it’s been


119
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,320
completed already.


120
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,600
The person to escort the magic stone is settled.


121
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,200
But...


122
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,320
But we still need something from Black Dragon.


123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,200
Him?


124
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,390
Ask him for what?


125
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,040
A village.


126
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,200
What brings you here?


127
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,640
I’m here to borrow something.


128
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,600
Really?


129
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,110
What is it?


130
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,480
As far as I know,


131
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,200
you had dragon slaves sneak into humans’ villages.


132
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,480
I’d like to borrow one village from you.


133
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,600
What for?


134
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,510
To take over


135
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,110
the North Sect, of course.


136
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,550
I’m intrigued.


137
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,830
How can a humans’ village


138
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,830
be used against the North Sect?


139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,320
It can’t bring it down directly,


140
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,390
but can lure out people I need.


141
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,480
Who?


142
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:24,000
Shen Cangsheng, the guardian of the North Sect


143
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,830
and his partner Liu Mubai.


144
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,880
If we can lure them into that village,


145
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,440
I’ll be able to


146
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:35,760
crack open the North Sect.


147
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:40,440
But how?


148
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,550
Nothing is settled yet.


149
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,640
I hope you can cooperate with me.


150
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,590
Once I succeed,


151
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,790
your troops can charge in


152
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,710
effortlessly.


153
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,350
When godfather asks about it,


154
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:08,550
you can take all the credit.


155
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,320
Other than borrowing a village,


156
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,230
what else do you need?


157
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,960
I also need Mo Xingtian


158
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,550
to lead those two there.


159
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,790
Fine.


160
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,030
I’ll help you.


161
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,200
My lady.


162
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,350
Where is he?


163
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,080
You may leave.


164
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:40,910
Yes.


165
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,110
Ms. Wen.


166
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,670
Welcome, Lord Xue.


167
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,000
Nice to meet you.


168
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,150
Aren’t you supposed to hold the fort


169
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,150
and finish your tasks?


170
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:03,030
Why did you come all the way


171
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,910
to Beiling?


172
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,960
I need your help


173
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,910
to sneak into the North Sect.


174
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,030
You want to go there?


175
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,280
Why?


176
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,110
To bring back my fiancée.


177
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,640
Aren’t you sweet and caring?


178
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,790
But,


179
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,280
now isn’t the right time.


180
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,590
I’ll finish those tasks


181
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,590
assigned to me.


182
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,110
My fiancée


183
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,080
means a lot to me.


184
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,550
Lord,


185
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,350
I’m needed elsewhere.


186
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,880
I’ll have people take you to your room.


187
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,670
I don’t get it.


188
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,230
The teleporting formation is under construction.


189
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,150
Once it’s complete,


190
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,710
that’ll be free access to the North Sect.


191
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,670
You can go there with me.


192
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,760
You’re astonishingly capable


193
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,910
that you can build a teleporting formation there.


194
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,030
Were l less capable,


195
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,590
would Lord Xue come


196
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,000
to seek help from me?


197
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,000
I’m sorry for my abrupt visit.


198
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,150
No need to apologize.


199
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,590
Once you’re there,


200
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,000
please kill


201
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,280
a Mu Chen for me.


202
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,350
Mu Chen?


203
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,640
What’s wrong?


204
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,320
You know him?


205
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,470
Of course.


206
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,470
You know what,


207
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,790
I want him dead, too.


208
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,320
What are the odds!


209
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,030
Why do you want to kill him?


210
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:00,520
He owes me.


211
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,080
Take Lord Xue to rest.


212
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,790
Attend to


213
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,760
all his needs.


214
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,440
Yes.


215
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,320
It's said that


216
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,790
villagers do business with Evilness Clan here.


217
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,550
I bet


218
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,910
they’re from the Dragon Palace.


219
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,000
I didn’t sense anything wrong.


220
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,000
Those dragon slaves certainly know


221
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,440
how to hide themselves.


222
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,470
You’re right.


223
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,400
We can’t leave out anything.


224
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,910
Let's see for ourselves


225
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,550
what really happened.


226
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,150
Is there any loophole of the barrier?


227
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,550
What about internal access?


228
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,470
Even if I knew,


229
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,470
I wouldn’t tell you.


230
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,200
Stop!


231
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,590
Perfect timing.


232
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,400
They don’t know how to enter the North Sect,


233
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,080
but you sure do.


234
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,470
That place will soon be ours.


235
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,200
I’ll let you live for a few more days.


236
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,760
Mubai.


237
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,320
In order to get the answer,


238
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,550
he killed the innocent.


239
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,440
Bury them properly.


240
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,470
I’ll slaughter Mo Xingtian.


241
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,670
I’m going with you.


242
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,520
Do you remember


243
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,350
the village we saw?


244
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,320
Killing Mo Xingtian is important,


245
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,670
and so is eliminating dragon slaves.


246
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,080
I couldn’t handle multi-tasks before,


247
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:00,840
but with you here,


248
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,440
I can do more.


249
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,080
Alright.


250
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,590
I’ll stay.


251
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,200
I’ll come back soon.


252
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,150
Come and catch me.


253
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:28,910
Wait for me.


254
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,470
Kids,


255
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,910
don’t go too far.


256
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,030
Come back early.


257
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,520
You must be an immortal.


258
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,030
Did they bump into you?


259
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,150
I’m fine.


260
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,590
Immortal?


261
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,400
I once met one


262
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,640
who slew demons.


263
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,590
You’re dressed up the same as him,


264
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,790
so you must be an immortal, too, right?


265
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:49,960
Sir,


266
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,910
has anything strange occurred


267
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,910
around your village lately?


268
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,200
Strange things?


269
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,470
No.


270
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,110
Not at all.


271
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,550
Think again.


272
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,790
Let me save you some time.


273
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,670
Strange things seldom happen


274
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,520
in our small village.


275
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,030
It’s too late


276
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,760
to go back to your place.


277
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,470
Why don’t you stay the night here?


278
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,470
That’ll be our honor.


279
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,840
Let’s go.


280
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,760
Follow me.


281
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,280
Be careful.


282
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,670
Your right.


283
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,280
Slowly.


284
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:41,880
Careful!


285
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,550
Mu Chen.


286
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,960
Don’t go any further.


287
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,350
Let me check first.


288
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,520
Jiuyou!


289
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,640
Step back!


290
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,200
What happened?


291
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,960
Is Luo Li around?


292
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,080
No sign of her.


293
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,589
It keeps thundering.


294
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,589
Be very careful.


295
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,710
Jiuyou!


296
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,800
Are you alright?


297
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:18,920
What are you doing?


298
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,310
I can handle this.


299
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,710
Don’t forget I’m your eyes now.


300
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,280
You must listen to me.


301
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,040
Fine.


302
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,470
I’m glad you're OK.


303
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,880
Are you an idiot?


304
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,070
I didn’t come here for you.


305
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:32,880
What?


306
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,880
I’m not here to help you


307
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,880
find Luo Li.


308
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,520
I’m here to find


309
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,880
the Thundering Pearl for myself.


310
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,950
Thundering Pearl?


311
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,350
Once I take that,


312
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,800
my power will grow tremendously


313
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,070
and I’ll become an immortal bird.


314
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,070
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?


315
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,520
Where is that Pearl?


316
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,230
Right at front.


317
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,710
At front?


318
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,430
Right ahead?


319
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,430
Yes.


320
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,640
But the thunder stops me


321
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,680
from going there.


322
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,680
Mu Chen.


323
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,640
What are you doing?


324
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,430
To get the Pearl for you.


325
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,160
Mu Chen.


326
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,350
Come back.


327
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,640
Mu Chen.


328
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,880
You’re still affected by the Dark Blood Spell.


329
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,230
You don’t have enough power to support yourself.


330
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,470
Mu Chen.


331
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,710
You can’t die without my approval.


332
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,800
I won't die.


333
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,310
I’ll help you get the Pearl


334
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,230
and you’ll have to save Luo Li for me.


335
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,590
You’re such a fool!


336
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,430
Go rescue her yourself.


337
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,280
I won’t help you.


338
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,190
Follow my lead.


339
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,830
Don’t go any further.


340
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,110
Come back.


341
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,470
Mu Chen. Mu Chen.


342
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,830
Watch out for the thunder!


343
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,920
Do you want to die?


344
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,190
I give up.


345
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,800
I don’t want to be an immortal.


346
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,470
I no longer need that Pearl.


347
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,400
I don’t want it.


348
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,000
I said no, Mu Chen!


349
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:53,760
Mu Chen.


350
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,110
You idiot!


351
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,520
You fool!


352
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,590
How far is it?


353
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,230
This is it.


354
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,520
Mu Chen.


355
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,640
Mu Chen.


356
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,040
Wake up, Mu Chen!


357
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,800
Mu Chen.


358
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:20,830
Please.


359
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,310
Here it is.


360
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,680
Our village is in poor condition.


361
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,800
Please bear with it.


362
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,070
Have some rest.


363
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,160
Thanks.


364
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,400
You’re welcome.


365
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,400
This is for you.


366
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,430
Thank you.


367
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,640
What’s your name?


368
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,230
My name is Wen.


369
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,680
Why are you living in a cave?


370
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,470
Where are you from?


371
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,350
Last year, a flood


372
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,560
struck my hometown.


373
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,760
All my neighbors and I fled here.


374
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:15,000
An immortal took us in


375
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,710
and taught us skills to protect ourselves.


376
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,680
Even my father can kill beasts with bare hands.


377
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,430
About that immortal,


378
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,110
what does he look like?


379
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,520
Where is he now?


380
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,470
Wen,


381
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,350
it's late.


382
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,190
Our guest needs to sleep.


383
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,430
Have some rest.


384
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,430
Come.


385
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,640
Come, everyone.


386
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,000
Stop!


387
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,560
You spilled the holy water


388
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,920
bestowed by God.


389
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,430
It's not holy water.


390
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,640
It’s polluted by the Power of Whisper.


391
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,160
They fooled you all.


392
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:26,880
What did you say?


393
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,560
I offered you a place to stay


394
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,310
yet you spilled our water


395
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,470
and insulted God.


396
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,110
Evil Deity isn’t a god.


397
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,590
Trust me.


398
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,430
I’m a student of the North Sect.


399
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,520
Mu Chen.


400
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,520
Mu Chen.


401
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,710
You've become a human.


402
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,920
You idiot!


403
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,520
I told you not to get the Pearl


404
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,400
but you didn’t listen.


405
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,160
Luckily, I took it in time,


406
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,880
otherwise, we’d both die.


407
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,680
I said I’d fulfill your wish.


408
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,350
I’m a man of my word.


409
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:17,950
Jiuyou,


410
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,190
without you in my mind,


411
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,800
I feel a bit emptiness inside.


412
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,880
I’m still blind.


413
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,520
I’m afraid


414
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,350
I’ll lose you one day.


415
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,070
This feather


416
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,040
is our link.


417
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:01,920
From now on,


418
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,070
wherever we are,


419
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,710
we can always sense each other.


420
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,520
Great.


421
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,230
Let’s go find Luo Li.


422
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,070
Now that I’m an immortal bird


423
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,160
and you've reached


424
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,760
the fourth level of the Futu Spell.


425
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,520
The thunder won’t be a problem.


426
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,160
Let me guide you.


427
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:17,950
OK.


428
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,920
We still need to be cautious.


429
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,160
Come.


430
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,110
Slowly.


431
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:27,920
Careful.


432
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,520
Careful.


433
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,110
I sensed a familiar power.


434
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,190
Is it Luo Li’s?


435
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,350
What’s wrong with you, Li Xuantong?


436
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,190
Who are you?


437
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,190
She’s Jiuyou,


438
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,190
my friend.


439
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,760
So you're that Jiuyou bird.


440
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,160
Goddess is too kind


441
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,350
to drain your blood.


442
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,830
You're all afraid


443
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,280
of the Xue God Clan, aren’t you?


444
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,280
You want to drain my blood


445
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,680
to summon the Luo River God?


446
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,430
You shouldn’t be called a god clan.


447
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,430
So useless!


448
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,000
Enough. Stop arguing.


449
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,880
Xuantong,


450
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,040
where’s Luo Li?


451
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,880
In order to find that Knot for you,


452
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,040
she got caught by a weird geezer.


453
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,590
I’ll kill you if anything happens to her.


454
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,160
Li Xuantong,


455
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,430
you're too weak to protect her.


456
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,560
Don’t blame Mu Chen!


457
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:24,920
Ridiculous!


458
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,760
Where did she get caught?


459
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,430
This maze changes all the time.


460
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,350
I can no longer find that place.


461
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,310
I can find her.


462
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,680
I’m able to sense her power.


463
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,560
Wonderful.


464
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,400
Jiuyou,


465
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,430
lead the way.


466
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,830
Sorry for my rudeness.


467
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,430
If you can help me find her,


468
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,110
I’ll apologize to you.


469
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,110
That’s more like it.


470
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,310
Let's go.


471
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,280
Come.


472
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,190
Headmaster.


473
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,280
That’s all.


474
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,110
Is the formation all set?


475
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,190
Yes.


476
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,000
Mubai.


477
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,110
You and Cangsheng were out for too long.


478
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,520
Is everything OK?


479
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,280
Thanks for your concern.


480
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,430
We encountered a few dragon slaves.


481
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,710
Nothing else happened.


482
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,950
What did you find about the village?


483
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,350
Headmaster,


484
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,470
Mubai must be tired.


485
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:13,160
You can ask him later.


486
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,110
You're right.


487
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,710
Mubai,


488
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,560
go back and rest.


489
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:23,710
What's wrong?


490
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,070
He must be exhausted.


491
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,520
I’ll bring him back


492
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,920
and ask Zhu Tian for some medicine.


493
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,350
Good day, Headmaster.


494
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,880
Thanks for your care.


495
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,400
I can get the medicine myself.


496
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,230
Mubai,


497
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,830
did you see dragon slaves


498
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,000
in the village last night?


499
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,110
Are you suspecting me?


500
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,950
I remember those villagers


501
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,950
are kind and honest,


502
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,950
especially the Wens.


503
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,800
Did you make a mistake?


504
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,230
Killing the innocent


505
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,520
is a heinous crime.


506
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,070
What are you implying?


507
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,040
Calm down.


508
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,430
I’m not implying anything.


509
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:37,680
How did you know


510
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,640
what happened last night?


511
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,950
The day has eyes,


512
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,160
the night has ears.


513
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,760
If others find out


514
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,680
that you killed those innocent villagers,


515
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,880
the reputation of our sect will be ruined.


516
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,310
They weren’t innocent.


517
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,280
They were followers of the Evil Deity


518
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,310
infected by the Power of Whisper.


519
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,110
But they didn’t harm others


520
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,590
or turn into monsters like those in Liu Territory.


521
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,280
Death is too much.


522
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,230
What do you want?


523
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,280
Do me a favor,


524
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:20,590
then I’ll keep everything a secret.


525
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,350
Think about it.


526
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,000
I've sensed Luo Li’s power.


527
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,350
She must’ve been here.


528
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,070
That's right.


529
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,040
This is it.


530
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,070
Are you sure?


531
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,400
Absolutely.


532
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,640
This is where Goddess got caught.


533
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,680
I saw that geezer and Goddess


534
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:52,880
left through a door,


535
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,040
but the door is gone.


536
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:55,230
Jiuyou,


537
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,880
what do we have around here?


538
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:00,560
An endless tunnel is right ahead.


539
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:05,950
Mu Chen.


540
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,560
Don't act rashly.


541
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,640
It’s dangerous.


542
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,430
There seems to be


543
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,880
a strong power at front.


544
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,430
I need to take a look.


545
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,920
Mu Chen!


546
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,160
Mu Chen!


547
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,190
So it’s all an illusion.


548
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:27,190
How did you do that, Mu Chen?


549
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,190
I can’t see


550
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,920
so I’m not affected.


551
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,950
Who’d know that?


552
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,560
Yes.


553
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,800
That’s the door.


554
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:37,950
Wait.


555
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,190
What's wrong?


556
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,350
Careful.


557
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,800
A wall is approaching from behind.


558
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,760
There’s no way ahead.


559
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:46,590
That door is all we have.


560
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,190
It should be the exit.


561
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,280
Let’s go.


562
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:49,760
OK.


563
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,710
Move.


564
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,190
Mu Chen!


565
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,040
Mu Chen.


566
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,040
Luo Li.


567
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,389
Is it really you?


568
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:17,800
How come you're blind again?


569
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,429
You’re right.


570
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:22,670
Only the Jade Knot can cure me.


571
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:23,840
How...


572
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:25,909
did you get here?


573
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:27,360
I brought him here!


574
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:29,949
Who are you?


575
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,230
She’s Jiuyou.


576
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:33,080
This is her human shape.


577
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,120
She helped me a lot along the way.


578
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,389
So this is what she looks like.


579
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,630
Luo Li.


580
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:40,630
Don’t risk your life


581
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,870
for me again.


582
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:44,710
Goddess,


583
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,389
that geezer who abducted you...


584
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:51,840
It's rare to have so many guests.


585
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,659
[North Sea Dragon Roc  Guardian Beast of North Sect]


586
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:53,760
Who is that?


587
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:55,080
What's going on?


588
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,429
Nothing.


589
00:34:56,949 --> 00:34:58,230
It’s just a weird man.


590
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,040
Dark Blood Spell.


591
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,670
So she’s trying to cure you.


592
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:07,910
Can Herbal Jade Knot


593
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,870
restore Mu Chen's sight?


594
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,150
You took my Thundering Pearl.


595
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,040
What?


596
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,800
You want it back?


597
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,910
All these years,


598
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,600
other than that girl Ling Xi,


599
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,150
I haven’t seen so many living beings.


600
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,670
You called Headmaster a girl?


601
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,800
Sir,


602
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,390
may I know your name?


603
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,190
You don’t know North Sea Dragon Roc?


604
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,870
How ignorant!


605
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,950
You're North Sea Dragon Roc?


606
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,800
I’ve heard so much about you.


607
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:46,190
Our sect is on lockdown.


608
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,760
Why didn’t you go out?


609
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,630
I won’t leave here


610
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,870
unless there's a dire catastrophe.


611
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,760
If so,


612
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,600
we’ll take our leave.


613
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,600
Our sect is in danger.


614
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,560
As students,


615
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,840
we’re obligated to guard it.


616
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,840
How about this?


617
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,360
If you can amuse me,


618
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,470
I’ll let you go


619
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,280
and tell you where the Jade Knot is.


620
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,120
Really?


621
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,230
Let me remind you


622
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:18,190
that you can’t use your power.


623
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:21,080
If you fail,


624
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,600
none of you can leave.


625
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,560
Sir,


626
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,670
please tie my hands.


627
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,280
What?


628
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,320
Sure.


629
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:41,430
And?


630
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,760
Look at my eyes.


631
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,670
Aren’t you blind?


632
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,150
Just do it.


633
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,120
Where’s the rope?


634
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,040
You have it.


635
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,230
I didn’t use any power.


636
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,230
Not bad at all!


637
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,080
You did it.


638
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:05,600
Young lady,


639
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:06,600
your turn.


640
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,280
Me?


641
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,120
I can't do anything.


642
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:14,630
Luo Li.


643
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:15,840
Luo Li.


644
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,760
You remember


645
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,520
what I taught you


646
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,670
on our way to the sect?


647
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,120
Cut to the chase.


648
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,600
What do you want?


649
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,710
Simple.


650
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,360
Go to Zhu Tian's room


651
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:09,000
and bring me the Space Stone.


652
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,840
That stone is to build the teleporting formation.


653
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:11,800
Why do you need it?


654
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,360
I’m working on a new formation.


655
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,600
That stone is a necessary material.


656
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:17,910
But


657
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:20,000
Zhu Tian and I don’t get along well.


658
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,280
That’s why I need your help.


659
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,520
I’m warning you.


660
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,800
Don’t you dare harm the sect.


661
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:30,150
However capable I am,


662
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,760
I alone am no match for all of you.


663
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,040
No time to waste.


664
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,320
Look forward to your good news.


665
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,600
Sun’er,


666
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,080
Mo Xingtian is hunting students of Five Sects.


667
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,150
It’s bad.


668
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,520
Bring these materials to Headmaster Ling Xi


669
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,520
to reinforce the formation.


670
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:23,320
Yes.


671
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,390
I will.


672
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,630
Are you done?


673
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,080
Come out.


674
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,230
You aren’t working on new formations


675
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:11,320
but building one for teleporting.


676
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,870
What are you up to?


677
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,910
You've seen it.


678
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,600
I can stop hiding.


679
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,630
Yes.


680
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,760
I am setting up a teleporting formation.


681
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,150
As for why,


682
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,630
that’s not your concern.


683
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,600
I’m reporting it to Headmaster.


684
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,430
Shen Cangsheng appreciates you.


685
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,630
You're one step away from restoring Liu Territory.


686
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,630
If everyone finds out


687
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,800
that you're a hypocrite,


688
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:43,080
you’ll be expelled immediately


689
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:45,390
and will forever live in the shadow of stigma.


690
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,560
Don’t push me!
