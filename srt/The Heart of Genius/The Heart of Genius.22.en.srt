can you consider me as him?

am I in that world?

In my heart,

he is like a mountain.

13
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,500
Good morning.

14
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,820
Why are you here?

15
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,780
I came here in the morning.

16
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:00,760
I waited until you woke up.

17

Where's Lin?

19
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,450
He went out an hour ago.

20
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,350
Did you have a pleasant conversation

21
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,470
with your dad last night?

22
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:24,820
Anyway,

23
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:26,700
we reached a consensus.

24
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,190
I promised him

25
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,620
I would leave the Cheese World.

26
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,460
Of course, he promised me

27
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,860
before I left,

28
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,170
he would treat me as his own son.

29
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,050
I think

30
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:38,860
it was good.

31
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,460

36

couldn't have the chance like me.

37
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,750
I was too greedy.

38
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,020
And I used to...

39
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,290
Do you remember

40

I'm still trying.

46
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,180
Now I realize

47
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,220
that I do take advantage of

49
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:26,960

50

of being a high school genius.

51
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,540
But when I learn new things,

52
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,560
I still feel that I'm an ordinary people.

00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,390
This is my home.

176
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,140
This is Sanwei University

177
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,820
in the suburban university town.

178
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,570
The straight-line distance of the two places is 20 kilometers away.

179
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,860
There are many different routes

180
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,300
to reach there.

181
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,860
But if we don't take a taxi,

182
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,300
we need to change buses and the subway

183
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:58,970
for several times.

184
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,380
Moreover, if we change the public transport,

185
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,820
we should walk for a long distance.

186
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,900
So what I'm thinking now is

187
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,100
to divide the map

188
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,790
into equal-sized grids.

189
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,100
Use N and E as the place's longitude and latitude respectively.

190
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,220
T is the time.

191
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,420
P is the probability of a car accident

192
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,040
occurring at a given moment

193
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,460
in a given time period.

194
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,560
Then, based on

195
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,940
Lin's experience on that day, his actual location,

196
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,140
and the route to the venue,

197
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,610
including the traffic condition,

198
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,940
the historical data,

199
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,330
the running time of the traffic lights at each intersection,

200
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,500
we can continue to give each grid

201
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,220
new values.

202
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,540
Using the historical data

203
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,460
and designated routes,

204
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,580
we can firstly give each grid

205
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,260
different prior probabilities.

206
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,100
Then, based on emergencies

207
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:35,780
and the time order,

208
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,930
we can use the real-time data

209
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,980
to update the posterior probability p

210
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,900
of every grid.

211
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:39,820
Bayesian Network.

212
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:40,530
You're right.

213
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,140
If we repeat

214
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,240
Bayes' theorem,

215
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:44,660
as the remaining distance

216
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,360
becomes shorter and shorter,

217
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,420
we'll get the grid

218
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,500
of the highest probability

219
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,220
after continuously updating and verifying the probabilities.

220
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,470
We'll be alert

221
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,140
to make up for the bias

222
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,290
caused by subjective judgment.

223
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,260
What tool will you use

224
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,270
to make a model?

225
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,320
Python.

226
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,140
Why not use

227
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:57,740
MATLAB?

228
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,900
It has many toolboxes.

229
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,820
and many

230
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,820
mature modules.

231
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,100
I think there are also

232
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,360
many third-party modules

233
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,300
in Python.

234
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,340
Just like NumPy. It can make Python

235
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,580
deal with large matrices

236
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,050
like MATLAB.

237
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,180
SciPy

238
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,500
also contains a lot of algorithms.

239
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:17,610
And

240
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,290
Matplotlib Module

241
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,970
can also let Python

242
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,140
draw a lot of function graphs.

243
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,330
So, in fact,

244
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:25,900
Python can replace a lot of tools

245
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,940
in MATLAB.

246
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,190
It also has some advantages

247
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,870
that can't be replaced.

248
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:35,980
I'm not talented.

249
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,120
You are a genius.

250
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,220
If I'm wrong,

251
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:39,920
or if you have

252
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,780
any better ideas,

253
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:41,500
just tell me.

254
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,320
I'll listen to you.

255
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,340
No.

256
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,140
I think you're right.

257
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,060
Really?

258
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,340
You've only been studying it for two months, right?

259
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,610
You're so smart.

260
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:49,850
No.

261
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,820
How can I compare with you?

262
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:52,820
Besides programming,

263
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,380
we also need

264
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,410
a lot of traffic data.

265
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:55,900
I can

266
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,780
ask my dad to help us.

267
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,530
You'll be in charge of programming.

268
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,010
Your dad will be in charge of the data.

269
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,470
I'll beat the drum for you.

270
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,290
Will it be too easy for me?

271
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,380
No matter how good the program can be,

272
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,210
you'll be the one

273
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,780
who takes the final risk.

274
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,540
You are the most important person.

275
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:11,980
So is the master.

276
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:13,770
By the way,

277
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,590
if I destroy the IOU,

278
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,100
will he continue to run the tutoring class?

279
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,360
My dad

280
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,410
is thinking about

281
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,850
to improve the family condition.

282
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,750
The class will start soon.

283
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,300
But he won't give up his math research.

284
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,740
Does he know

285
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,510
about our jump?

286
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,990
I have told him.

287
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,250
The safest way now

288
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,700
is to tell him

289
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,460
all the rules

290
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,900
and let him set off to the meeting hall

291
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,830
in the scheduled time

292
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,490
and then come back

293
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,450
after the meeting.

294
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:42,100
In this way,

295
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,320
whether he will attend the meeting or not,

296
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,180
the result will be the same.

297
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,870
How about going to my house this weekend?

298
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,470
We can do the programming together.

299
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,900
This weekend...

300
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,380
Will your mother be home?

301
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,010
Yes.

302
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,070
What's wrong?

303
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,220
It was my idea

304
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:07,980
to go to the police office to report. She didn't...

305
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,650
No.

306
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,060
It has nothing to do with that.

307
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:10,660
Really.

308
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,830
I...

309
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,820
I'm just a little embarrassed.

310
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:15,580
I'm sorry.

311
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,580
I'm a little scared of your mother.

312
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,700
Are you scared?

313
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,810
I'm a girl after all.

314
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,110
I can be shy,

315
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:24,780
embarrassed,

316
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:25,870
and weak.

317
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:26,660
Xi.

318
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,090
[Education is an important cornerstone]

319
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,090
[of national revitalization and social progress]

320
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,300
Let's go.

321
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,070
Let's play basketball.

322
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:29,740
Do you want to die?

323
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,210
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

324
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:39,300
Weak.

325
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,740
This might be Lin Zhaoxi in the Cheese World.

326
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,460
Why are you laughing?

327
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,760
Let's continue.

328
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:01,970
Dad.

329
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,220
I may need

330
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,610
some traffic data of our city.

331
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:06,860
Do you have any idea?

332
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,960
What data?

333
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,580
The car accident record of a year

334
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,820
and the data of traffic and pedestrian flow

335
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,870
of some roads.

336
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,860
It would be better if we can set a date

337
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,260
to check traffic monitors of the city.

338
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,240
We can't check traffic monitors.

339
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,810
The car accident information

340
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,220
is about the parties involved

341
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,250
and what happened to them.

342
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,320
This is personal privacy.

343
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,090
So we don't need details.

344
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,050
I only want the data.

345
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,740
There must be some data

346
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,060
that our city needs to submit to the higher authority every year.

347
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,670
For example, the number of car accidents,

348
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,580
the number of

349
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,700
casualties,

350
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,140
locations of accidents,

351
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:42,880
and so on.

352
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,420
Yes, it's available.

353
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,780
Why do you need it?

354
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,450
We need to go back

355
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,860
and get ready for it.

356
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,150
Well.

357
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:52,900
Well.

358
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,420
Go back there.

359
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,180
If we want to go back,

360
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,030
we have to suffer a car accident.

361
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,860
So we want to write a program

362
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,780
to predict the location of the accident.

363
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,900
Will the accident be dangerous?

364
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,780
I won't be in danger.

365
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,980
But Lin Zhaoxi and the master

366
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:10,770
may be in danger.

367
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,540
So we need to lower the risk

368
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,440
by predictions.

369
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,400
How do you predict the accident?

370
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,280
Can you do it?

371
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,850
It's actually very simple.

372
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,480
In our daily life,

373
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,690
for example, we often say

374
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,060
at a place

375
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,140
that the front is an accident-prone area.

376
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:33,690
Yes.

377
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:34,140
It's a warning.

378
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,200
This is the simplest use

379
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:37,970
of statistical mathematics

380
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,900
in transportation.

381
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,180
Now we know

382
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,390
there must be a car accident

383
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,500
and it must

384
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,250
happen to my master.

385
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,500
All we need to do

386
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,550
is to bring in a large amount of data

387
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,390
and to use

388
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,060
a more sophisticated way

389
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,000
of processing the data.

390
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,220
Then, we may be able to calculate

391
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,020
where the accident will happen.

392
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,560
How do you calculate this?

393
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,590
By math models.

394
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:57,420
I don't understand.

395
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,850
But don't worry.

396
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,810
I'll take care of this.

397
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,060
I've been a traffic police officer for many years.

398
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:04,980
They should

399
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,250
give me a face.

400
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,260
Thank you, dad.

401
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:08,880
Thank you.

402
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,590
Don't say that.

403
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,780
You're like a stranger.

404
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,740
Well.

405
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,590
how long

406
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,500
do you plan to stay?

407
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,440
Till next February, okay?

408
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,260
We can only leave at that time.

409
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,700
Don't worry, dad.

410
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,520
I promised you

411
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,740
to leave.

412
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,800
So, I'm a man of my word.

413
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:37,900
No.

414
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,170
Don't think too much.

415
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,760
I'm just checking.

416
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,390
Why are your hands so cold?

417
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,200
It's not good for a young man to have cold hands.

418
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,370
Dad, this is your son's body.

419
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,150
I'm very healthy in that world.

420
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,530
Look at me.

421
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,710
Well.

422
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,200
How old are you there?

423
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,480
23.

424
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,190
You've graduated. Do you have a job?

425
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:13,620
A university teacher?

426
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,460
A boxer.

427
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,640
A boxer?

428
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:17,690
Just like me.

429
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:18,560
Yes.

430
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,440
How can you

431
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,970
become a boxer?

432
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,050
It's to

433
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:28,810
commemorate you.

434
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,420
Pei Zhi, stand up!

435
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,670
Pei Zhi, stand up!

436
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:37,200
Pei Zhi.

437
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,150
Stand up.

438
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:40,980
Dad.

439
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,490
Stand up.

440
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,540
No wonder

441
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,580
you've improved a lot recently.

442
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,690
It's okay.

443
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,630
You're more like me in the past.

444
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,579
Before I came here,

445
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,569
I participated in a competition.

446
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,260
I met a Thai boxer before.

447
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:10,579
He was short and strong.

448
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,640
He had great resisting ability.

449
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,780
He called Pilavakhun.

450
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,119
I know Pilavakhun.

451
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:16,920
He's a famous Thai boxing champion

452
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,310
in the past two years.

453
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:18,980
Yes.

454
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,220
He's quite famous in my world.

455
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,390
Have you fought with him?

456
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:22,380
Yes.

457
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,020
But at that time,

458
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,460
when he competed with me,

459
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,480
he was a veteran.

460
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:26,780
He was actually powerful

461
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:27,380
in all aspects.

462
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:28,940
He was just old

463
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,670
and not strong enough as before.

464
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,620
So I calculated how to win

465
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:32,540
and beat him.

466
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,410
You can use your mind to fight.

467
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,190
You're much better than me in the past.

468
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,220
Thank you, dad.

469
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,180
Where are you going?

470
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,100
I'll find Pei Zhi.

471
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,620
Why do you still go to him?

472
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,690
Have you forgotten what he did to you?

473
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,920
He also let our father take so much debt.

474
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,040
Okay. Okay. Calm down.

475
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:03,900
The debt has been canceled.

476
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:04,800
That was a misunderstanding.

477
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,540
How could these troubles be explained

478
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,930
to be caused by a misunderstanding?

479
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,550
Anyway, the relationship between Pei Zhi and I

480
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,770
can't be described simply.

481
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,340
You don't understand it.

482
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:12,880
Are you two back together again?

483
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,600
No.

484
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,310
Just focus on your study.

485
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,940
Sister. Lust can make people vulnerable.

486
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:27,300
Who's that?

487
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,140
Hello, auntie.

488
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,780
I'm here to see Pei Zhi.

489
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:33,740
Pei Zhi.

490
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,140
Auntie.

491
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,690
I bought you some fruit.

492
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,150
No, no, no.

493
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:38,990
Take it. Take it.

494
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,900
That's inappropriate.

495
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,940
Just eat it.

496
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,180
Let's talk in my room.

497
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,690
We'll go in first.

498
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,460
Will you have lunch here?

499
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,840
No, thanks.

500
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:51,820
We'll just talk for a while.

501
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,040
Hello?

502
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,550
Hello, Pei.

503
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,300
Come back quickly.

504
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,140
Something happened.

505
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:20,860
No.

506
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,900
Something really happened.

507
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,030
Lin Zhaoxi is here.

508
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,130
Why isn't it a serious thing?

509
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,760
The two kids

510
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,860
were at loggerheads.

511
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,190
Now they

512
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:33,910
seem to be close.

513
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,310
I don't know if it's true.

514
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,260
Come back quickly.

515
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,820
I was so embarrassed just now.

516
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,980
We need to use a computer to monitor in real time.

517
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:45,830

with my computer.

521
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,140

and then change the result of the accident?

524
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,220
I'll let the car

525

526

to collect data ourselves.

invested in a shop.

we couldn't rent it out
