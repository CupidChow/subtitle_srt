00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:39,940
You can do it.

176
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,090
Come on, Ms. Pei.

177
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,260
Just hit my hand.

178
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,040
Left.

179
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,659
Left.

180
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:45,930
Good. Right.

181
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:46,740
Right.

182
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,250
Lower your head.

183
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,260
Lower.

184
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:48,700
Lower.

185
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,670
Don't be afraid, Ms. Pei.

186
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,220
Just hit me hard.

187
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,260
Release your strength.

188
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:51,790
Come on.

189
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:52,740
Punch hard.

190
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,570
Left. Right.

191
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:55,030
Ms. Pei. You're quite strong.

192
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:55,530
Ms. Pei.

193
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:56,810
Hai.

194
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,250
You called her Ms. Pei?

195
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,460
Well...

196
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,240
It's just a joke.

197
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,510
Please take it easy.

198
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,540
Sorry,

199
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,460
I... I have things to do.

200
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,340
Have a good chat.

201
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,340
Xi.

202
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,900
I'm very happy

203
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,190
to see you today.

204
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,140
All these years,

205
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,170
with Pei Zhi around,

206
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
I didn't treat him well.

207
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,780
Sometimes,

208
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,850
when I saw him unhappy,

209
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,540
I really hoped

210
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,040
a girl like you

211
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,200
could be his side

212
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,640
and take good care of him,

213
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,370
so that he could have someone

214
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,150
to rely on in the future.

215
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,900
I'm getting old.

216
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:44,600
I can't keep up with

217
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,460
what you young people think.

218
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,240
And I'm feeling a bit tired.

219
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,430
You are a good girl.

220
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,830
As long as you two

221
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,660
are on good terms,

222
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,670
I'm not against your relationship.

223
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,130
Xi.

224
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,420
If you don't want him to die,

225
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,760
then don't let him learn math.

226
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,580
About what your mother said...

227
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,140
My mother saw you

228
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,220
and thought I wanted to study math again.

229
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,870
What's wrong with studying math?

230
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,510
It's okay.

231
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,300
If you don't want to explain it,

232
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,300
you don't have to.

233
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,640
I'm fine.

234
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,660
Why don't we...

235
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,910
No, I think

236
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,020
I shouldn't hide it

237
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,660
from you anymore.

238
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:27,890
My grandfather

239
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,700
was a math teacher

240
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,440
in the 1980s,

241
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,590
the last century.

242
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,650
He was also a mathematician.

243
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,570
Just like the master,

244
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,220
He did research in his spare time,

245
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,290
studying combinatorial mathematics.

246
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:43,920
He was a genius,

247
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,290
and made great achievements.

248
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,300
Later, some scholars in Beijing

249
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,220
found out about him,

250
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,190
and invited him

251
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,400
to attend an academic meeting.

252
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,540
Luo Jiayi,

253
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,460
you are just a middle school teacher.

254
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,640
Why are you attending the academic meeting?

255
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,190
This is the greatest academic meeting

256
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,950
of combinatorics now.

257
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,060
I need a week.

258
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,140
No, just give me five days

259
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,530
and money for travel tickets.

260
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,140
If you attend the meeting,

261
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,460
will you get a pay increase?

262
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:18,730
No.

263
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,180
Will you have a higher title?

264
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,250
No.

265
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,060
Then what's the point of participation?

266
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,520
I don't agree anyway.

267
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,260
My grandma didn’t agree till the end.

268
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,990
Grandpa borrowed money from others

269
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,790
and raised 200 yuan as travel expenses.

270
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,160
After that meeting,

271
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,300
my grandpa

272
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,420
was invited by Germans

273
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,220
and went abroad.

274
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,170
He never came back.

275
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:53,780
My mother thought it was math

276
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,690
that took my grandpa away.

277
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,580
So she doesn't want me

278
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,130
to study math.

279
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,660
My father passed away

280
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:02,560
when I was in Grade 9.

281
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,110
She was even more extreme after that.

282
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,130
Do you remember when I told you

283
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,150
that I would never come to you again

284
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,860
because I had to focus on

285
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,040
the college entrance exam preparation?

286
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,220
Of course.

287
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,770
That was when she found out

288
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,350
I secretly learned from the master.

289
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,540
When I took the college entrance exam,

290
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,140
I wanted to apply for

291
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,420
the Mathematics of Sanwei University.

292
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,100
She...

293
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,690
She forced me to meet someone

294
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,720
in Germany.

295
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,790
Your grandfather?

296
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,380
My grandfather.

297
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,180
In a mental hospital, however.

298
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,060
After my grandpa went to Germany,

299
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,690
he did get

300
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,980
a better academic environment.

301
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,020
But out of guilt for his wife and daughter,

302
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,400
not long after that,

303
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,780
he was diagnosed

304
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,100
with mental disease.

305
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,690
What's worse,

306
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:09,770
my mom thought

307
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,510
I would inherit his disease.

308
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,190
The test results

309
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,460
proved her worries.

310
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,430
My mom thought

311
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,790
studying math in depth

312
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,160
would trigger the disease.

313
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,910
She didn't allow me to learn math.

314
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,260
But I was eager to study it.

315
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,570
At that time,

316
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,290
we often quarreled

317
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,120
and came into conflicts.

318
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,480
Until I was diagnosed

319
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,070
with a minor mental illness.

320
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,730
So I started boxing.

321
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,630
Combining sports with professional treatment.

322
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,020
Although I recovered later,

323
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,020
I could only listen to my mother

324
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,240
and stayed in Germany,

325
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,030
with a major

326
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,210
having nothing to do with math.

327
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,460
So you went to Germany

328
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,940
without telling me.

329
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,810
and never contacted me.

330
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,390
This is the reason?

331
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,530
I'm a patient.

332
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,850
I don't know how to face you.

333
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:14,750
I'm sorry.

334
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,340
That's why you said that day

335
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,680
that we were not suitable to each other.

336
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,570
Pei Zhi, look at me.

337
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,180
I don't care about that.

338
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,950
I like you.

339
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,080
It has nothing to do

340
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:32,990
with whether you learn math or not

341
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,100
and whether you're sick or not.

342
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,350
But my illness

343
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,660
may relapse anytime.

344
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,530
You've defeated it once.

345
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,380
I trust you.

346
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,980
But Xi, I...

347
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,940
I think I'm sick again.

348
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,780
What's wrong?

349
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,110
I've found something.

350
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,460
And I think my father is still alive.

351
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,880
Am I crazy?

352
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,140
What do you mean?

353
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,400
He's lucky.

354
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,380
Not badly injured.

355
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,380
He was sent to the hospital,

356
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,690
reeking of alcohol.

357
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,080
He must have drunk a lot.

358
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,100
Can you describe briefly

359
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,440
what happened just now?

360
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:31,980
I'm recording now,

361
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,680
for the retention.

362
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,340
That's the only content

363
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,980
in this recording pen?

364
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,230
That traffic cop talking was my dad,

365
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:47,900
but the point is,

366
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,270
the recorder

367
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,500
went into production in 2010.

368
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,260
This recording was dated

369
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,900
February 22, 2013.

370
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,700
My father died in 2009.

371
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,900
Could it be that...

372
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,180
that you heard it wrong?

373
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,770
It's just that their voices were similar.

374
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,540
I've had a voiceprint comparison

375
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,380
between the recording

376
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,500
and my dad's former videos.

377
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:13,940
Even if I heard it wrong,

378
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,100
the computer couldn't go wrong.

379
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,220
And I've checked it.

380
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,770
My dad had the same

381
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,700
official recording pens

382
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,640
when he was the traffic police.

383
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,730
It's all so coincidental.

384
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,460
Did you see his body

385
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,420
after his death?

386
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,170
But I didn't see the cremation.

387
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,610
It can't be resurrection.

388
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,790
This is not logical.

389
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:48,910
Since I got

390
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,940
this recording pen,

391
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,900
I've thought about many possibilities.

392
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,910
I even thought

393
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,380
maybe my dad

394
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,960
was burdened by a huge secret

395
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,180
and his safety was threatened.

396
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,670
So he had to pretend to die

397
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,610
to escape a murder.

398
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,060
It's like a plot in movies.

399
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:06,099
Right.

400
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,210
That's why I think

401
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm crazy.

402
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,380
Maybe it's

403
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,619
a second recording?

404
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:13,710
Someone took this pen

405
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,079
to record your father's audio.

406
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,069
Who would do that?

407
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,109
What's the motive?

408
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,040
I don't know either.

409
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,230
But it sounds

410
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,730
more reliable.

411
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:25,920
Do you think

412
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,579
I'm truly sick?

413
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:27,380
No.

414
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:29,740
I didn't mean that.

415
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,920
I just put forward

416
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,260
one more possibility.

417
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:38,900
When did you see

418
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,120
this recording pen?

419
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,300
I remembered one day,

420
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:44,960
I slept for a long time.

421
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,120
I didn't know why,

422
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:47,860
but when I woke up,

423
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,820
I found this recording pen

424
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,700
and a Newton's cradle

425
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,590
by my bed.

426
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,930
Did someone sneak in

427
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,960
and put them?

428
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,550
So scary.

429
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,700
I thought so at first.

430
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,690
But I was searching

431
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:19,990
for a long time.

432
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,660
I couldn't find

433
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,560
any traces of outsiders sneaking in.

434
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,850
This recording pen

435
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,730
appeared out of nowhere.

436
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,450
Suddenly appeared.

437
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,090
Out of nowhere.

438
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:37,740
Not logical.

439
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,260
What did you think of?

440
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,820
If...

441
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,370
According to what you said,

442
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,540
if the same thing

443
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,860
happened to your father,

444
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,550
first of all,

445
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,660
in 2013,

446
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,340
he couldn't

447
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,490
still work in the traffic police force.

448
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,480
Even if there's a recording pen,

449
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,760
the recording content couldn't

450
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:00,530
be about his work.

451
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,010
It's definitely not logical.

452
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,450
Right. Then I've been thinking

453
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,520
if there's something

454
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,640
I don't know yet.

455
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:07,790
Actually...

456
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,350
I have a way

457
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:11,490
to explain it.

458
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,500
What is that?

459
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,540
You might find

460
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,560
my words exaggerating,

461
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,120
and even think I'm crazy.

462
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,620
It can't be.

463
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,220
I always believe you.

464
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,600
About a month ago,

465
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,380
to be precise,

466
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,380
a week ago in this world,

467
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:33,760
I also received

468
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,860
something unlogical.

469
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,290
It was a photo.

470
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,810
Why do you have this photo?

471
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,280
This is the photo

472
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,770
of Zhang Shuping's training camp.

473
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,070
I was even one of them.

474
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,610
Look, this is me.

475
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,800
Math.

476
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,100
Where are you going?

477
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,530
Calm down.

478
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,310
Calm down.

479
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,990
Hey, hey.

480
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:58,490
Calm down.

481
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,260
Don't touch me.

482
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:03,760
Lin Zhaoxi.

483
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,260
Come on.

484
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,440
[Group 1 Pei zhi, Lin Zhaoxi, Lu Zhihao]

485
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,440
[Group 2 Li Haitao, Lin Zhaosheng, Zhang Shuping]

486
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,640
Lin Zhaoxi, come on. Everyone's waiting for you.

487
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,140
Three, two, one.

488
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,060
It turns out a parallel world.

489
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,430
You believe me?

490
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:34,820
Xi,

491
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,100
if I wanna travel to that world

492
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,340
and find my father,

493
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,340
what should I do?

494
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:47,940
Mom,

495
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:49,730
have you ever thought

496
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,980
my father is still alive?

497
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,660
Your father cremated.

498
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,050
I saw it with my own eyes.

499
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,580
And so did many relatives and friends,

500
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,830
and even your father's colleagues.

501
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,370
Is everyone

502
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,850
lie to you?

503
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,570
Don't bother to think

504
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,440
about that stupid recording.

505
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,180
No.

506
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,020
I really have a clue this time.

507
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,340
Call him out.

508
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,540
Let me see

509
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,220
what he looks like now.

510
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,500
Mom.

511
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,200
Father is still alive.

512
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,040
But he's in another world.

513
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,820
A parallel world.

514
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,200
Pei Zhi,

515
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,560
I'll make an appointment with Dr. Jia.

516
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,340
Let's go for a check-up. Okay?

517
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,460
Mom,

518
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,060
I'm not sick now.

519
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,180
Someone has been to that world.

520
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,380
Who?

521
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,180
I will find a way.

522
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,240
I know.

523
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,660
It's hard to explain to you, but...

524
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,780
If I can successfully

525
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,470
travel to that world and see my dad,

526
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,510
do you have any words for him?

527
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:45,780
Tell him I miss him.

528
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,140
I miss him too.

529
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,600
If I wanna travel to that world

530
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,730
and find my father,

531
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,850
what should I do?

532
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,790
I don't know.

533
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,470
[Group 1 Pei Zhi, Lin Zhaoxi, Lu Zhihao]

534
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,470
[Group 2 Li Haitao, Lin Zhaosheng, Zhang Shuping]

535
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,540
Hello?

536
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,770
Did you find the tutoring class?

537
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,190
None of them suitable.

538
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,210
What about the place Lu recommended?

539
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,610
I went to them,

540
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:53,610
but they have admission requirements.

541
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,500
I'm not qualified.

542
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:00,180
I met Zhang Shuping, by the way.

543
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,160
No wonder they have

544
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:02,990
requirements for students.

545
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,220
Still Snape-like.

546
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,700
You didn't catch up with him?

547
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,730
To ask for some benefits?

548
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:10,740
No.

549
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,590
He doesn't know me in this world.

550
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:13,940
I left after a brief talk.

551
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,170
Isn't your father his old classmate?

552
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,780
It's not necessary.

553
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,130
And until now,

554
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,230
I have no idea about what's going on

555
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,380
between him and my father.

556
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,180
Are they friends or rivals?

557
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:26,490
You're right.

558
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,130
Hey, are you free tomorrow?

559
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:31,900
I have something

560
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,250
to discuss with you.

561
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,210
Wait a minute.

562
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,540
I have to check my schedule.

563
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,100
Okay.

564
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,290
Great!

565
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,740
Hey, I've checked tomorrow's plan.

566
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,100
I think I can spare some time.

567
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:54,860
Good.

568
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,010
When you're available,

569
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:56,640
tell me.

570
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,490
I'll come to you.

571
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,740
Okay.

572
00:24:59,030 --> 00:24:59,870
Bye.

573
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:02,740
Great!

574
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,250
Lu! Lu!

575
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,090
What's the rush?

576
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,260
Everyone in the company is watching.

577
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,170
Calm down.

578
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,430
Go on with your work.

579
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,760
I need your help.

580
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,060
Go ahead.

581
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,270
Let's go in.

582
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,630
You're still up?

583
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:38,790
Are you hungry?

584
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,270
Do you want some snack?

585
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:40,860
I'm not hungry.

586
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,250
I just want to see what you are doing.

587
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,760
You signed up for the tutoring class?

588
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,350
I want to try it on my own.

589

[Calculus]

590
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,410
Calculus.

591
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,060
Is it difficult?

592
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,380
Too difficult.

593
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,210
Lin,

594
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,540
was it easy for you

595
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,930
to learn calculus?

596
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,780
I think so.

597

[Calculus]

598
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,780
Pei Zhi had mastered it in high school.

599
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,620
He just knew a little.

600
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,840
Anyway, he's superior to me.

601
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,660
I'm different from you two.

602
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,870
My IQ...

603

Have you heard of that?

604
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,790
He used

605
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,100
god-like thinking power

606
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,160
to first prove

607
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,270
the operation and image of planets,

608
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,780
the orbit of comets,

609
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,420
and the tide of oceans.

Newton's epitaph.

611

the IQ

613
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,230
of Newton and Leibniz?

614
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,500
What about Archimedes, Descartes,

615
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,370
Fermat, Roberval,

616
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,960
Desargues, Barlow and Wallis?

617
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,260
What about these people?

618
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,540
I don't know.

Most people don't know.

621
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,700
But we know that

622
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,980
from the 7th century BC

623
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,110
to the 17th century AD,

624
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,730
these great mathematicians

625
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,660
I've just mentioned

626
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,380
made great efforts

627
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,770
to keep raising,

628
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,440
thinking and solving questions.

629
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,740
Finally,

630
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,420
the man with a god-like mind

631
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,690
formed the calculus,

632
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:25,520
a new discipline.

633
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,640
Of course,

634
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,720
Newton was just

635
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,000
one of the recognized founders in history.

636
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,730
However,

637
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,710
this was indeed the beginning of

638
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,300
calculus being called a discipline.

639
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,020
During hundreds of years,

640
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,760
many mathematicians keep improving it.

641
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,960
I have to say that.

642
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,070
We can see planes

643
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:41,660
when we look up.

644
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,350
We can see rails when lowering our heads.

645
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:44,620
This world has become

646
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,540
what it looks like now.

647
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,700
It's all because of calculus.

648
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,460
During this process,

649
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,170
you keep learning and experience it.

650
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:51,830
How happy

651
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,770
the process is.

652
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:53,720
Meanwhile,

653
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,560
amid the happiness,

654
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,460
you'll experience

655
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,430
a little difficulty.

656
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,780
It's a natural thing.

657
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,090
Sorry, I'm a bit excited.

658
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,630
I know what I should

659
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,190
learn from you.

660
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,610
No matter how talented you are,

661
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,540
in front of math,

662
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,600
always be honest and humble.

663
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,060
I need improvement too.

664
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,330
Actually, I've just passed

665
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,070
the stage where you are now.

666
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:18,720
Everyone

667
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,470
has their own difficulties.

668
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,030
In a word,

669
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,420
studying hard always improves strength.

670
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,300
Keep going. I'll leave you alone.

671
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,300
Studying hard always improves strength.

672
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,380

673
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,140

what you like.

678
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,780
As long as you are not changed by the world,

679
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,940
you've changed the world.

680
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:17,990
Why are you here?

681
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,640
You didn't bring the key?

682
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,090
When you can

683
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,730
understand this problem,

684
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,520
you've surpassed me.

685
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,300
I'll study hard

686
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,460
and help you with the problems.

687
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,340
Dad.

688
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,760
I was about to wake you up.

689
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:45,660
Hurry up.

690
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,090
What's the rush?

691
