[Episode 10]

4
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:47,000
So I'm an accountant.

5
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,280
Say something.

6
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:55,860
Say something.

7
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,550
Say something.

8
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:04,500
Yes?

9
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,479
Have you solved the P/ NP problem?

10
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,120
Not yet.

11
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,710
What about my research?

12
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,860
Is it a success?

13
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,750
You've been studying math.

14
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,100
But I don't know

15
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:18,920
the details.

16
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,190
Then it's a failure.

17
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,050
In the first half of my life,

18
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,350
I thought I was a genius.

19
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,530
But then...

20
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,370
No, dad.

21
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,600
Don't think about it.

22
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,329
I'm out of my mind.

23
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,190
How could this happen?

24
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,020
Dad. Dad.

25
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,140
Let's not think about this, okay?

26
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,020
You'll get better.

27
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,710
Dad.

28
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,620
You know what?

29
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:04,410
When I first went to that world,

30
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,270
I was really scared and panicked.

31
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,900
But you gave me a lot of support.

32
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,020
Every time I do something,

33
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,700
I always think of

34
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,870
what you said to me.

35
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,150
Here are some examples.

36
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,579
It's not a big deal.

37
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,620
There will be a solution.

38
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,410
It's not the time to be hopeless yet.

39
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,300
No matter what the result is,

40
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,540
the experience of being hardworking and dedicated

41
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,940
will always bring me something.

42
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,920
As long as you are not changed by the world,

43
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
you'll change the world.

44
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:55,710
What are you doing?

45
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,540
Why haven't you went to bed?

46
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,070
Why haven't you went to bed?

47
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,120
I'm going to bed now.

48
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,890
Something is playing in your mind.

49
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,500
Why do you say so?

50
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,530
You've been acting weird lately.

51
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,310
The last time you behaved in such a serious manner,

52
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,220
it was

53
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,570
when I filled out my application for the college entrance exam.

54
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,290
Your menopause has come?

55
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,790
What menopause?

56
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:22,220
See,

57
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,020
other parents

58
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,860
are always

59
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,660
urging their children to get jobs and married,

60
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,580
and give birth to their grandchildren.

61
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,110
But you didn't urge me for those stuff.

62
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,550
You urged me to be a moth flying to the fire.

63
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,270
I also want you

64
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,200
to live a normal life.

65
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,790
I know it's a kind of happiness.

66
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,000
But I'm your dad.

67
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:44,580
I know you well.

68
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,790
I'm afraid you'll regret it later.

69
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,780
In the future,

70
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,330
one day when I'll be dying

71
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,760
on the bed.

72
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,500
and you'll just stare at me

73
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,420
like what you are doing now.

74
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,360
With the chat today running in your mind,

75
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,660
what will you say?

76
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,660
What's the password to our saving account?

77
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,230
Why do you...

78
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,750
Can you stop killing this chat?

79
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,710
Let me say it another way.

80
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,220
I like Michael Fassbender.

81
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,140
Can I go after him?

82
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,060
Your classmate?

83
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:20,870
No.

84
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,040
The young Magneto.

85
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,150
I like him too.

86
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,490
But even so I don't have to go after him.

87
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,340
I don't care neither if I fail.

88
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,940
Can you guarantee

89
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,060
from now on, you won't think about maths

90
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,900
and Pei Zhi?

91
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,780
You are better at killing this chat.

92
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,170
Forget it. I'm going to sleep.

93
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:43,930
Lin Zhaoxi,

94
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,700
in this long yet beautiful

95
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,740
life,

96
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:47,950
as long as you truly

97
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,820
want to do something,

98
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,420
no matter when you start it,

99
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,120
no matter when you start it,

100
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,570
it's not too late.

101
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,620
When I was in primary school,

102
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:13,620
to finish the writing practice,

103
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,260
I always quoted your words

104
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,210
as sayings said by

105
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,570
Golkie,

106
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,510
Edison and Franklyn.

107
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,820
I was praised by the teacher.

108
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,910
She said I'm knowledgeable.

109
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,140
My classmates also said

110
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,430
I was chef Lin good at cooking chicken soup for the soul.

111
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,220
I told them

112
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,760
I didn't make the chicken soup.

113
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,960
I just passed it on from someone else.

114
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,360
You're right.

115
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,670
I shouldn't be

116
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,270
submissive

117
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:40,780
and worried about gains and losses.

118
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:46,860
It shouldn't be like this.

119
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,510
I'm going to resign.

120
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,680
I'm going to study maths.

121
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,280
I'll find Pei Zhi

122
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,330
and tell him I like him

123
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,070
even if he may reject me.

124
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,800
I will take good care of you

125
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,890
and myself.

126
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,210
Everything will be fine.

127
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,240
Dad,

128
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,670
is this place familiar?

129
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,710
Take care.

130
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,060
Move.

131
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,530
It doesn't work.

132
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,660
My dad has no response.

133
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,680
Does it has something to do with the doctor?

134
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,510
My dad is close to

135
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,620
a leader in Sanwei Medical School.

136
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:37,410
How about ask him for

137
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,280
introducing us to a good one?

138
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:38,900
It's okay.

139
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,130
Have some water.

140
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,610
Thank you.

141
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,130
Director Ma is

142
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,270
an expert in this field.

143
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,340
He made it clear last time.

144
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,670
There's little hope for my dad to recover.

145
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,280
I just want to take good care of him.

146
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,900
I'll cook for you.

147
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,380
Don't bother.

148
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,500
Just order a takeout later.

149
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,950
It's okay. I can cook fast.

150
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,730
How about I hiring someone for you?

151
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,660
I can do it myself.

152
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,580
You're a girl.

153
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,150
If anything happens to your dad,

154
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,140
you can't move him.

155
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:23,860
Not to mention, you can't

156
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,160
watch him 24 hours a day.

157
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,840
Let me think about it.

158
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,790
You've bothered a lot to help

159
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,780
me and my dad.

160
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,430
I'm really grateful.

161
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,670
We have brought you so much trouble.

162
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,340
Thank you.

163
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,650
After coming back,

164
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,760
you've been so polite to me.

165
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,570
I'm really not used to it.

166
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:02,840
I...

167
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,250
I'm actually not used to it either.

168
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,390
When we were in the Cheese World,

169
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,220
I didn't feel it.

170
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:09,840
After I came back,

171
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,030
your superstar's face shows up before me every day.

172
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,010
I need to take this call.

173
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:17,710
Okay.

174
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,400
I want to quit.

175
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,820
You heard me right. I want to quit.

176
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,980
Okay, I'll be right there.

177
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:49,790
I might need you

178
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,940
to take care of my dad for me.

179
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,170
I need to go out.

180
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,160
Sure.

181
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:53,800
Thank you.

182
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,630
Is anything

183
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,340
in trouble?

184
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,690
I'll go through a resignation procedure.

185
00:11:58,770 --> 00:11:59,660
What's being a regular worker?

186
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,410
Go away.

187
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,680
I want to be a postgraduate

188
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,700
for mathematic study in Sanwei University.

189
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:07,960
You have made up your mind?

190
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,150
In the Cheese World,

191
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,270
before so many people,

192
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,180
I announced that I want to study maths.

193
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,340
I can't break my words.

194
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,560
And I've thought it through.

195
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,030
One percent possibility is better

196
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,380
than doing nothing.

197
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,870
If my dad continues to be like this,

198
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,320
I'll carry on his research.

199
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,920
You should have done that earlier.

200
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,320
You don't have to sacrifice yourself.

201
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,590
I... I'll go pack up.

202
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,510
Well,

203
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,540
let me order a takeout for you.

204
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,150
No need.

205
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,020
I can order it myself later.

206
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,040
Sure.

207
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,780
Wait for me.

208
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,640
Ladies and gentlemen,

209
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,300
thank you

210
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,370
for your recent help.

211
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,940
I've learned a lot.

212
00:12:59,300 --> 00:12:59,830
Thank you.

213
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,030
There are so many scenes.

214
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,040
Who are you acting for?

215
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,140
We won't see each other again.

216
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,940
My aunt told me

217
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,810
you were a hardworking person.

218
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,370
I admire people like you the most.

219
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,740
What's the use of

220
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,700
these tricks?

221
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,660
You're acting one way before us

222
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,180
and another behind our back.

223
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,820
Can someone like you be a genius?

224
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,000
Luckily, I didn't let you be a member of my family.

225
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,630
If prestigious universities accept

226
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,000
students like you

227
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,240
they all will be closed sooner or later.

228
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:36,720
Human beings

229
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,510
should respect each other,

230
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,180
director.

231
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:45,640
Yes.

232
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,660
To graduate from a prestigious university

233
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:49,510
maybe

234
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,450
not a big deal.

235
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,390
But do you know,

236
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,850
why many girls like me

237
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,160
study hard?

238
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,820
Because only studying hard

239
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,290
can make them independent

240
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,350
spiritually and economically;

241
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,350
and give them the courage

242
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,380
to refuse boys and work

243
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,270
they don't like.

244
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,480
Lin Zhaoxi,

245
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,060
in this long yet beautiful

246
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:27,890
life,

247
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:28,990
as long as you truly

248
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,440
want to do something,

249
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,300
no matter when you start it,

250
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,960
it's not too late.

251
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,360
Mom, I'm going out.

252
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,380
Come back early.

253
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:55,830
Okay.

254
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,260
Look,

255
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,680
you get dressed up.

256
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,740
Where are you going?

257
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,510
None of your business.

258
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:05,650
Come back.

259
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:08,770
Come here.

260
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,290
What's wrong?

261
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,460
Well.

262
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,030
How is Xi's father?

263
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,060
The sun is rising from the west.

264
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,680
I don't know you can care about others.

265
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,070
I thought you only cared about

266
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,700
playing mahjong and counting money.

267
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,370
Don't be sarcastic.

268
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,540
I'm serious.

269
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:27,820
Uncle Lin has waken up.

270
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,240
Wait, wait, wait.

271
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,760
He has waken up?

272
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:33,850
Yes.

273
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,470
He has left the hospital.

274
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,660
But his condition seems to be worse.

275
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,160
He can't even speak clearly.

276
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,120
I see.

277
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,300
Find a free time,

278
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,190
buy some fruits and pay a visit to Uncle Lin.

279
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,670
Just say it's a gift from me.

280
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:48,980
Sure.

281
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,310
Dad?

282
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,000
What?

283
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,660
Money.

284
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,100
Kid, you even wouldn't pay such a little money

285
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,260
for your dad?

286
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,080
No.

287
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,470
You said it was a gift from you.

288
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,060
Why should I pay?

289
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:04,690
Why didn't I have another kid!

290
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,090
Fine.

291
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,110
Here, take it.

292
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,210
That's it?

293
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,940
Tell me the cost when back and I'll reimburse your payment.

294
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,100
Is it enough to buy anything?

295
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,690
Forget it.

296
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,600
I'll cover the spend for you.

297
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,860
Only spend but don't earn money. You black sheep.

298
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,710
Uncle Lin, do you want some fruit?

299
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:58,980
Lu.

300
00:16:59,140 --> 00:16:59,710
Where are you?

301
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,060
At home.

302
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,060
At home, right?

303
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:02,810
Open the door.

304
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,490
I'm in front of your apartment.

305
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,310
I say I'm at my friend's home.

306
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,869
A girl, right?

307
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,349
A boy.

308
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:15,859
Okay, come on.

309
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:16,920
Take a photo for me.

310
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,910
I don't think it's a good idea.

311
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,510
Take a photo and prove yourself.

312
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,640
Or tell me

313
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,270
your address.

314
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,150
I'll be right there.

315
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:24,010
Lu,

316
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:26,619
why are you acting like a grumpy woman now?

317
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,069
You're in an emergency.

318
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:29,490
You can't have any more scandals.

319
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,750
I'm afraid you'll lose your mind

320
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,180
and forget your identity.

321
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,640
Remember,

322
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,190
You can hide anything from anyone

323
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,640
except the company.

324
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,670
I know.

325
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,010
Lu,

326
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,690
how can you not trust me?

327
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:52,830
Wait for me.

328
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:53,720
I'll take a photo for you.

329
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:13,940
Did you receive it?

330
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:14,700
Yes.

331
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,570
Who is this?

332
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,070
A friend of my dad.

333
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,280
I came to visit him.

334
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,130
We haven't finished yet.

335
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,450
I'll hang up if there's nothing else.

336
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,460
Bye bye.

337
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,120
Who is your dad?

338
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,690
Xiaomeng, don't rush over.

339
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm still outside.

340
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,860
Is Uncle Lin alone at home?

341
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:46,820
No.

342
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,100
Ji Jiang is taking care of him for me.

343
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,890
What? Ji Jiang is at your home?

344
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,770
What’s going on between you and Ji Jiang?

345
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:00,410
We are just friends.

346
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,170
He accompanied you to the hospital,

347
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,280
handled things here for you,

348
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,690
and almost brought about a chaos in the hospital.

349
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,160
He also helped you take care of your dad.

350
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,990
He's not just a friend.

351
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,190
We're truly just friends,

352
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,260
and alumni.

353
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,300
Don't talk nonsense outside.

354
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,300
Especially in your shop.

355
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,530
People in your shop like to post Moments.

356
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,740
It'll be bad for him.

357
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,580
You care so much about him?

358
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,870
How could you say there's nothing between you two?

359
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,910
I remember now.

360
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,820
He talked about the common jet lag

361
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,770
that day.

362
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,610
Why aren't you saying anything?

363
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,710
Am I right?

364
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,460
Pei Zhi.

365
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,510
Pei Zhi?

366
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,560
You already have Ji Jiang.

367
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,020
Why do you still want Pei Zhi?

368
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,650
I am hanging up now.

369
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,010
Thank you.

370
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,500
Excuse me,

371
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,730
where did the person you just carried go?

372
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:18,810
Over there.

373
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:19,390
Thank you.

374
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,340
Hello.

375
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,340
It's your first time here, right?

376
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:59,640
Do you want a card?

377
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:01,430
We teach boxing,

378
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,060
martial arts, taekwondo,

379
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:02,610
and any lessons you want to take.

380
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,860
50% off during the promotion.

381
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,330
You can't find a second place like us

382
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,470
in the whole city.

383
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:32,720
Long time no see.

384
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,740
Long time no see.

385
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,770
Aren't you hot?

386
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,480
I've never seen you so nervous.

387
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,570
Actually, I was also nervous before.

388
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,000
I was nervous every time I went to your home.

389
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,170
But I did some preparations

390
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,120
so I hid it very well.

391
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,870
After you went to Germany,

392
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,220
I sent you

393
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,310
many emails.

394
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,490
Did you receive them?

395
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,420
Why didn't you reply?

396
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,790
When did you come back?

397
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,340
I've been back for 8 months and 27 days.

398
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,180
I saw the poster of you

399
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,560
outside.

400
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,150
I'm now

401
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:15,870
the boxing coach here.

402
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,380
I heard

403
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,460
that your dad taught you boxing when you were young.

404
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,990
I didn't expect

405
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,290
you're working in this field now.

406
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,590
I haven't thought...

407
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,720
I haven't thought

408
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:36,870
that I would meet you here.

409
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,380
Are you avoiding me on purpose?

410
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,370
I didn't study maths in Germany.

411
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,170
I let you and Mr.Lin down.

412
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,000
Do you think I meet you here

413
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,160
because of maths?

414
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:08,570
Zhaoxi.

415
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,400
Memories are beautiful, but...

416
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,280
That's the reality.

417
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,430
So I'm just a memory.

418
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,300
You know what?

419
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:33,950
According to

420
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,980
my original personality,

421
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,420
I would stand up now

422
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,310
and tell you

423
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,260
I'm sorry for bothering you.

424
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:39,640
Then I would leave with tears.

425
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,140
But today,

426
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,270
I have to react in another a way.

427
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:53,580
Guys,

428
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,460
give me some time please,

429
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,680
I have something to say.

430
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,610
Pei Zhi.

431
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,310
I've always liked him.

432
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,490
I have a crush on him for a long time.

433
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,550
Wow.

434
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,650
But we're not in a relationship.

435
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,430
Because after the high school,

436
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,460
he went to Germany.

437
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,720
and disappeared without a word.

438
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:21,540
Today, God makes me

439
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,400
meet him again.

440
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,320
So I won't let him

441
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,560
run away again.

442
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:29,620
Please keep an eye on him.

443
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,120
I'll come here to see him from now on.

444
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,630
If one day I can't find him

445
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,500
and he disappears,

446
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:34,940
I'll get even with you one by one.

447
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:35,970
OK.

448
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,690
Don't worry, Mrs. Pei. We will keep an eye on him

449
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,770
and follow him wherever he goes,

450
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,800
even to the toilet.

451
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,820
I have to go home now.

452
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,200
But I'll come here again.

453
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,010
Welcome whenever you come, Mrs. Pei.

454
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,820
Not bad, bro.

455
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,880
This girl is interesting.

456
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,750
Watch your opponent.

457
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,770
Lower your gravity.

458
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,210
Like this.

459
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,590
Focus on using your waist's strength to move your hands.

460
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:23,470
Come on.

461
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,060
Go on.

462
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,630
Lower your elbow.

463
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,390
Go on. Left, right, left.

464
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,050
OK. Watch your steps.

465
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,850
Left, right, left, head down.

466
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,100
Too late.

467
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:39,660
Left, right, left. Head down and punch.

468
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:41,940
Come on. Left, right, left. Head down.

469
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:43,210
Turn around.

470
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,050
Come on. Left, right, left. Head down.

471
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,550
If you by then

472
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,150
stuck on this,

473
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:49,960
we would have had

474
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,550
ten, or at least eight,

475
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,020
golden belts.

476
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,650
Mr.Yu, you flatter me.

477
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,750
Many people are better than me.

478
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,100
Don't pretend to be modest.

479
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,160
Tell me.

480
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,810
When we were on training before,

481
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,790
who was better than you?

482
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,610
Don't you think

483
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,500
you shouldn't

484
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,690
follow the instruction of your father-in-law

485
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,040
and become a traffic police officer?

486
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,000
Look.

487
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,710
Look how good the boxing market is now.

488
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,100
You are elder than 40 years old?

489
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,350
Enjoy your meal.

490
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:23,710
Mr.Yu.

491
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:25,290
Was my dad awesome

492
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:25,880
when he was young?

493
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:27,700
What do you mean?

494
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,400
He was quite impressive.

495
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,740
With a pair of iron fists, he was so ambitious.

496
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,750
He was the one we adore all the time.

497
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,100
He was said

498
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,930
to be invincible in the south of the Yangtze River.

499
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,560
His wish was

500
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,920
to conquer the boxing world in northern China,

501
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,590
and to go as far as Harbin.

502
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:45,930
Unexpectedly,

503
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:46,840
just entered northeast China,

504
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:47,890
he ran into your mother.

505
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,270
He was captivated by your mother.

506
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,070
Dad, watch your mouth.

507
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:54,900
Okay.

508
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,480
Use the phrase popular in your school.

509
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,150
What is it?

510
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,890
A perfect match.

511
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,040
A perfect match.

512
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,190
You,

513
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,230
you are the result of

514
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:08,660
the perfect match.

515
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,150
Come on.

516
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,010
Dad, I want to play boxing too.

517
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,960
Study hard.

518
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,270
Boxing can be a hobby.

519
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,130
Come back soon.

520
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,480
Sir,

521
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,550
can you drive faster for me?

522
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:41,990
Okay.

523
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:42,580
Okay, thank you.

524
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:43,670
You're welcome.

525
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,060
Ji Jiang.

526
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:00,740
Where is my dad?

527
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,310
You are back.

528
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,410
Here, have a look.

529
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:13,640
What happened?

530
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,450
Let me tell you.

531
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,470
After your leaving,

532
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,650
your dad suddenly woke up.

533
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,200
Just like what Xiaomeng said,

534
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,180
he thought he was in his 20s

535
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:23,820
and in his youth.

536
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:24,590
He even asked me who I was.

537
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,590
Why was I at his home?

538
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:26,630
I could only tell the truth.

539
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:28,330
I said I was your daughter's friend.

540
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,020
How could you tell him that?

541
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:30,920
What if he realizes

542
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:31,520
he is old,

543
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,590
and can't accept it?

544
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,800
Your dad saw my phone.

545
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:35,830
He was so smart.

546
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,520
Within several scrolls,

547
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,430
he realized something was wrong

548
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:38,790
and asked me which year it was now.

549
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,850
I was terrified.

550
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,840
I was wondering if I should tell the truth.

551
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,910
Suddenly, I thought something.

552
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,260
I thought the day we arrived at the hospital.

553
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,230
Didn't I tell you

554
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,390
your dad looked like he did a time travel too?

555
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,800
So I lied to Uncle Lin and said,

556
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,590
"Uncle Lin,

557
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,760
you've traveled from the past to the future.

558
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,270
It's 2018 now."

559
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,310
I then showed your dad

560
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,500
all kinds of home appliances

561
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,070
such as TV, computers,

562
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,590
and the phone.

563
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:01,780
Your dad did believe it.

564
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,090
He really thought

565
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:03,860
he traveled from the past.

566
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,670
How could you lie to him?

567
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,980
I had no choice.

568
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,300
It was an emergency.

569
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,180
But think about it.

570
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,600
Your dad has accepted it.

571
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,920
He won't be destroyed

572
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,510
by it anymore.

573
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,130
He won't be in a slump.

574
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,420
It will be much easier for you to take care of him.

575
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:20,920
No.

576
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:21,770
Lies

577
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,000
will be exposed one day.

578
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:24,580
When he finds out

579
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:25,660
his life in his 40s

580
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,630
is a mess,

581
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,030
he wants to go back but he can't,

582
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,090
and he can only waste

583
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,090
more than 20 years.

584
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:30,840
He would be devastated.

585
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,640
So you have to let him know

586
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,620
he can go back.

587
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:34,860
We've been through this.

588
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,100
Give him some hope.

589
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,460
Set a difficult goal.

590
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,290
Tell him

591
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,480
that he can go back after achieving it.

592
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,980
Let him live in peace first.

593
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,290
You can

594
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,070
gradually impart views to him

595
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,110
and let him accept the reality.

596
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:47,990
Then everything is fine.

597
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,940
What did he read?

598
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,390
Uncle Lin heard from me

599
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,390
that the Internet was very advanced now

600
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,180
and any program could be watched online.

601
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,480
He told me

602
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,750
he wanted to watch the 1994 World Cup.

603
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,020
I taught him how to surf the Internet by computer.

604
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,720
He searched the program himself.

605
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,640
Last time he used the computer,

606
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,790
he was freaked out.

607
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,390
This time

608
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,430
he was sitting there and watching the program.

609
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,360
Maybe your idea works.

610
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,380
Right?

611
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,550
I told you my idea was not bad.

612
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,370
If it were me,

613
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,430
I wouldn't dare to use it.

614
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:28,980
I'm afraid my dad will go into pieces.

615
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:35,120
Let's give it a try.

616
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,120
Nice shot!

617
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,360
Nice shot!

618
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,610
Are you avoiding me on purpose?

619
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,530
I thought the decision that I didn't learn maths

620
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,490
let you and Mr.Lin down.

621
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:55,060
Do you think

622
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,530
I come to meet you here because of math?

623
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:59,700
Memories are beautiful, but...

624
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,650
that's the reality.

625
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,370
The harsher you treat yourself, the more you get.

626
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,040
What do you think?

627
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:45,460
No.

628
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:46,510
You...

629
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:47,970
Why are you throwing this book?

630
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,010
This book...

631
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,330
He's just a middle school student in Grade 9.

632
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:51,280
Why did you let him study

633
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,640
in the maths class of the Juvenile University?

634
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,580
My son is

635
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:54,050
a math genius.

636
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,440
What kind of maths genius is he?

637
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,740
Can you describe

638
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:10,920
what happened just now.

639
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,590
I'm recording it.

640
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,290
Leave a file.

641
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,150
My daughter and I were on our way.

642
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,710
I heard

643
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:27,580
the car behind me was noisy.

644
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:31,890
When I looked back,

645
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,980
the car rushed over.

646
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,570
Luckily, my daughter reacted quickly

647
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,240
and dragged me.

648
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,230
Then the car

649
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:43,780
crashed into it.

650
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,030
You are back.

651
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,000
Dad, you remember me?

652
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,500
No.

653
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,450
But I know you're my daughter.

654
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,210
There is your photo on the table.

655
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,210
Your file is on the computer.

656
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,179
And the things in this room are

657
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,159
for girls.

658
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:10,230
This is my home.

659
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,150
I can infer that

660
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:11,690
you are either my wife

661
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,199
or my daughter.

662
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:13,130
But you're young.

663
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,030
You are my daughter.

664
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,070
You head was hurt,

665
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,030
but it works well now.

666
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,080
I'm a genius.

667
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,070
The computer system

668
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:20,590
and the Internet

669
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,690
are much more advanced

670
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,429
than what I used in America.

671
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,550
Judging from this point of view,

672
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,860
what he said is true.

673
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,300
I did come from the past.

674
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,010
I just searched online

675
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,580
for the four words: transcending time and space.

676
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,940
I found massive information.

677
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,830
Our society has moved forward.

678
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,179
In this era,

679
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,600
transcending time and space

680
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:38,760
is not something surprising.

681
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,570
He probably found a bunch of novels.

682
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,670
It is still something surprising.

683
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,250
So this is a secret.

684
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,900
We'll keep this secret for you.

685
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,840
OK. I was afraid you wouldn't believe me.

686
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:54,590
Yes.

687
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,290
Ji Jiang told me everything.

688
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:57,310
Yes.

689
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,880
She didn't believe it until I explained.

690
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,540
Well,

691
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,190
can you two

692
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,060
take me out?

693
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:05,920
I really want to see

694
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:06,950
what the world have become

695
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,140
after 20 years.

696
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:09,460
Sure.

697
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:11,860
Okay.

698
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,580
Wait for me in the living room.

699
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:14,630
I'll pack up and leave.

700
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,320
Don't be so polite.

701
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,300
It's awkward.

702
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,610
Although

703
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,940
we are father and daughter,

704
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:21,650
we're peers.

705
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,470
We are about the same age.

706
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,620
You can call me Lin.

707
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,520
I'll call you Little Lin.

708
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,530
Okay, Lin.

709
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,180
Then, when you go out,

710
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,330
don't call me dad. Don't call me dad.

711
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,230
Let me dress myself up.

712
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:37,830
Now I'm not sure.

713
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:38,900
Is your dad

714
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:39,880
too excited?

715
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,600
Help me calm him down.

716
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,050
Well,

717
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,070
I'll call Director Ma.

718
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:44,780
Okay.

719
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:45,450
Hurry up.

720
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,500

Of course.

781
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,940
As for the rapid development of China,

782
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,560
people living 20 years ago

783

couldn't think about it.

Come on, calm down.

786
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,130
Lin.

787

It's such a nice place.

788
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,360
Why don't you stay here?

789
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,420
No, I have to go back.

790
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,080
I have to contribute

791
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:02,710
to the social development.

792
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,110
Think about it.

793
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,340
If everyone rushes to the future like me

794
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:06,130
and only enjoys his life,

795
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:06,910
who work to develop our society?

796
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:10,650
Look at Lin. He's so noble.

797
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:11,810
Besides,

798
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:13,990
I'm 20 now.

799
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,060
Look at my body, it is in my 40s.

800
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,460
I have a great youth

801
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:19,290
which I haven't experienced yet.

802
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,440
If I stay here,

803
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,660
I'll lose more than 20 years.

804
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,030
As for your guys,

805
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,730
one thing you said is right.

806
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:29,260
Yes.

807
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:31,370
I shouldn't have

808
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,470
come here for no reason.

809
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,310
I have my mission.

810
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:35,940
I have a task.

811
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:36,850
Yes.

812
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:38,300
I can only go back

813
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:38,900
after finish the task.

814
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:39,710
Otherwise, I can't go back.

815
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,040
But the problem is I don't know

816
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:42,960
what my mission is.

817
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:45,210
Do you know?

818
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:49,780
That's tricky.

819
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:50,820
That's tricky.

820
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,800
Don't worry.

821
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,220
You have so much time.

822
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:54,740
Right?

823
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:55,790
Take your time.

824
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,580
Steady steady.

825
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,310
Let's have fun first.

826
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,380
Yes, fun first.

827
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:05,750
I'll watch the 1994 World Cup

828
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:06,450
when I go back home.

829
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:08,710
I just watched the qualifiers.

830
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:10,660
I have to see who the king was.

831
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,610
I remember it was...

832
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:18,800
I forgot.

833
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:20,370
Here, Lin.

834
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:21,170
Here's to you.

835
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:21,550
Here.

836
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:22,890
Me too.

837
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,100
There are many things on the Internet.

838
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,080
You can watch anything you want.

839
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,100
Great!

840
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:30,650
Great.

841
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:48,700
He's asleep.

842
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,590
Thank you for today.

843
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,970
Don't mention it.

844
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,440
Now we're back to the reality.

845
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,240
Why do you think the Cheese World

846
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,070
is fake?

847
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,080
You know

848
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,430
that's not what I meant.

849
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,880
By the way, I found Pei Zhi.

850
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:13,940
He came back.

851
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:17,000
I met him today.

852
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,250
You wouldn't have thought

853
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,630
he's now a coach at the boxing club.

854
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,870
Did you mistake him for someone else?

855
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:22,490
No.

856
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:29,900
I'm glad you found him.

857
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,320
How is he now?

858
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,710
I want to see him.

859
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:33,900
Pei Zhi.

860
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,650
He has changed a lot.

861
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,760
What are your plans?

862
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,580
What plans?

863
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,510
More than 4 years have passed

864
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:58,830
and he's quite unfamiliar to me now.

865
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,050
I just don't know

866
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,010
what happened to him in Germany.

867
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,350
He didn't even reply my emails.

868
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,300
We need to figure it out.

869
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:10,990
Four years is not long,

870
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,020
but it's not short neither.

871
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,050
People are changing.

872
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:26,060
Ji Jiang! Ji Jiang! Ji Jiang!

873
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:28,690
Ji Jiang! Ji Jiang! Ji Jiang!

874
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,100
Ji Jiang! Ji Jiang! Ji Jiang!

875
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,940
Ji Jiang! Ji Jiang! Ji Jiang!

876
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:39,160
Ji Jiang! Ji Jiang! Ji Jiang!

877
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:40,910
The old way.

878
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,380
Ji Jiang is here.

879
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,010
Ji Jiang! Ji Jiang! Ji Jiang!

880
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,470
Ji Jiang! Ji Jiang! Ji Jiang!

881
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,810
Ji Jiang! Ji Jiang! Ji Jiang!

882
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:54,630
Ji Jiang! Ji Jiang! Ji Jiang!

883
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:59,360
Thank you for your support.

884
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,550
Be careful.

885
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:01,730
Don't stay here.

886
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:02,890
Okay, thank you.
