4
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:38,690
Principal Zhang,

5
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:40,440
you are here.

6
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,759
Actually, the kids

7
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,100
were just kidding.

8
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:43,900
They were definitely not fighting.

9
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,030
Absolutely not.

10
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,020
I think it was just an accident,

11
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,180
accident...

12
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,289
Accident?

13
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:50,580
Zhang Liang’s mom,

14
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,560
if your son

15
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,530
is lying on this bed,

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,310
can you

17
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,380
be so casual?

18
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,240
-Mom... -How can you say that?

19
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,550
It was really an accident.

20
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,200
It's okay, Zhang Liang.

21
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,190
We're still friends.

22
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,660
Your arm is like this.

23
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,630
It was not an accident.

24
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,580
Everyone saw it.

25
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,860
They all saw it.

26
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,620
No, Zhang Liang’s mom,

27
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,580
actually, our family

28
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,390
-is willing to pay the medical expenses. -I don't want to listen to your explanation.

29
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,300
-I don't want to listen to your explanation. -Mom.

30
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:09,710
His hand is like this.

31
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,350
Are the medical expenses the most important thing?

32
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,780
You just give me some money and you think this is done, right?

33
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,980
Did you do it?

34
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,020
Everyone saw it.

35
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,710
-Aunt. -Don't be angry.

36
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,579
Mom, it was really my fault.

37
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,920
Why was it your fault?

38
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,020
Did you push him?

39
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,940
How to deal with it?

40
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,300
How to deal with it...

41
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:34,470
I will try to smooth it over.

42
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:36,910
The other party

43
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,660
is a friend of Lin Zhaoxi in the welfare home.

44
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,510
The background is a bit complicated.

45
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,730
Kids misunderstood it.

46
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,860
Judging from what they said,

47
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,180
it should be an accident.

48
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,490
Zhang Liang always causes trouble.

49
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,010
I guess he was spoiled by his mother.

50
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:52,950
But he looks

51
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,950
responsible.

52
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,900
Don't punish him.

53
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:56,980
They are in the 12th grade.

54
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:58,570
At this time,

55
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,390
the school should be careful

56
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,370
when it makes every decision.

57
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,630
Don't worry about others.

58
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,120
Think about

59
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,140
the training center I told you.

60
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,490
Actually, it was not our fault.

61
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,950
Last time I jumped,

62
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,460
Ji Jiang lost his family because of me,

63
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,750
and I ruined his dream of being a star.

64
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,930
I should have worked hard,

65
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,050
but I became a study slacker.

66
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,310
And I got you in this world

67
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,220
in trouble in passing.

68
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,190
This time,

69
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,030
Lu Zhihao's arm was broken because of us.

70
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:32,590
You said that

71
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,579
we would have a better future

72
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,090
when we came to this world.

73
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,310
But I really think that

74
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,420
things are getting worse.

75
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,030
There are many things

76
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,260
that we can't control.

77
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:45,870
We can only control

78
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,660
our own lives.

79
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,460
We can work hard to

80
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,460
make our future better.

81
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,620
Then why can't we

82
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,010
go back to our own world

83
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,770
and work hard?

84
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:53,850
Because there are many regrets

85
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,600
that we can't make up for

86
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,820
in that world.

87
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,440
But in this world, we can make up for them.

88
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,440
This is cheating.

89
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:01,770
Cheating?

90
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,130
Why is this kind of novel so popular?

91
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,540
Just because there are people

92
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,340
who want to lead a life in which they can cheat.

93
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:10,900
Now the chance

94
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,840
is right in front of us.

95
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,769
What if I still decide

96
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,560
to go back?

97
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:24,700
What will you do?

98
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,450
Did you quarrel with Pei Zhi?

99
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,060
No.

100
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,540
Then why didn't you say anything all the way?

101
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:20,990
Is there a generation gap between us?

102
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,270
No.

103
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,260
Let me ask you something.

104
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,140
I...

105
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,020
Fine, I have something to ask you too.

106
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,820
Do you think our family is poor?

107
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,220
Yes.

108
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:35,580
Are you done?

109
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,700
Isn't it obvious?

110
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,450
This question...

111
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,190
No,

112
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,540
everyone feels differently,

113
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,300
right?

114
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,570
Poverty is just a feeling.

115
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,460
But I wasn't finished.

116
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,080
Although we are poor,

117
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,980
we are quite happy.

118
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,090
What's your question?

119
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:52,960
My question

120
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,870
is a bit complicated.

121
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,540
Is it a Math question?

122
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,130
No.

123
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,900
Let me think about how to say it.

124
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,930
Let me tell you a story.

125
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,500
Well...

126
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,440
Once upon a time,

127
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,980
there was a little fox

128
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,820
who lived with her dad.

129
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,710
One day,

130
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,500
her dad was ill,

131
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,180
seriously ill.

132
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,730
At that time, the little fox

133
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,490
suddenly jumped to

134
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,980
a parallel world.

135
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,710
In the parallel world,

136
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,060
she met a healthy dad.

137
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,950
After that,

138
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,550
the little fox could choose to

139
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,770
go back to her world

140
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,850
and take care of that sick father.

141
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,380
Or she could stay

142
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,170
and lead a relaxing life.

143
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,530
In your opinion,

144
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,950
what should the little fox choose?

145
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,890
Is this a physics question

146
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:05,750
or an ethical question?

147
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,920
It's a philosophical question.

148
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,990
Then I think it should go back.

149
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:15,700
Why?

150
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,430
Because

151
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,800
people have to face their difficulties.

152
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,660
Is this evading responsibility

153
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,360
in the parallel world you said?

154
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,440
Well,

155
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,810
if you were

156
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:42,300
the sick dad,

157
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:46,200
would you want the little fox to go back?

158
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,650
No.

159
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:51,740
Why?

160
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,950
Because every parent

161
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,510
wants their children

162
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,030
to lead a happy life.

163
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,460
When some old people are sick,

164
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,430
they aren't afraid of death in the end.

165
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,340
They are afraid of being a burden on their children.

166
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,770
One day, when I am terminally ill,

167
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,830
don't spend money trying to cure me.

168
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,880
Why are you always thinking

169
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,180
so clearly?

170
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,900
Don't you have any moments

171
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,590
when you are helpless

172
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,780
and don't know what to do?

173
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:25,770
I have.

174
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,820
When?

175
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,360
When I knew

176
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,600
I had a daughter.

177
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:48,260
♫If the world is a sea♫

178
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:43,900
What?

179
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,180
I think...

180
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,750
you're suddenly so moving.

181
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,900
♫Your smile is the paddle breaking through waves♫

182
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,780
I am telling the truth.

183
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,250
♫Treat my panic♫

184
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,710
And now the black hole

185
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,100
is growing bigger and bigger.

186
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:04,780
♫The person who loves me the most♫

187
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:09,370
♫ He takes me all the way to chase the stars♫

188
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,750
♫But he forgot himself♫

189
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:10,620
I need to cook the meal.

190
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:20,440
♫Remember that I was lying on my dad’s shoulder♫

191
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,220
Let's go home.

192
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:27,630
♫He taught me how to open my wings♫

193
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:33,220
♫To fly to where I want♫

194
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,610
♫You care about me like the eaves that make me peaceful♫

195
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:35,580
Son.

196
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:36,540
Dad.

197
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,900
I just downloaded an action film.

198
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,780
Let's watch it together.

199
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,500
♫You shade the wind and rain for me every day♫

200
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:39,570
Sure.

201
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,210
I'll get you the iced cola.

202
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,020
Dad, I don't want to drink cola.

203
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,120
♫No matter where we are, we are as ordinary as the beginning♫

204
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,960
Can I have beer with you?

205
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,790
♫Never change♫

206
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,590
I've been waiting for these words

207
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,030
for 17 years.

208
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:51,730
Come on.

209
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,710
♫You also accompany me to travel through the depth of time♫

00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:02,860
Again.

213
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,560
Bottom up? Not bad.

214
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,270
Ice.

215
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,220
Drink.

216
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,020
I'll drink up too.

217
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:27,040
♫You witness my wish to grow♫

218
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,640
I'll take a nap.

219
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,180
♫You are wrinkled like a newspaper♫

220
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,130
♫You hide your sadness♫

221
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:43,770
♫You said that there should be light in my eyes♫

222

Sister,

00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,240
I heard you were blocked by Zhang Liang

232
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,470
and Lu Zhihao broke his arm too.

233

♫Never change♫

Don't worry, sister.

I will help you to vent your anger.

♫You also accompany me to travel through the depth of time♫

Enough.

00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,030
Have a rest.

239
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,940
How's your preparation for singing?

240

♫And pass every season♫

I have confidence in myself.

That's good.

245
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:42,670
Good luck.

246
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,460
Sister,

247
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,210
you even prepared a new gift for me.

248
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:47,900
No, no.

249
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,740
This is not for you.

250
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,860
If it's not for me,

251
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,540
why did you buy it?

252
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,720
I practice English listening.

253
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,700
Stop joking.

254
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:55,760
I don't believe it.

255
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,470
I'm going to work hard now.

256
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,650
Can't I work hard?

257
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,590
Sister, this drawing is good.

258
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,030
I will go to bed first.

259
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:06,740
Rest early.

260
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,240
[Girls don't cry.]

261
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,020
Sister.

262
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:24,580
I am coming.

263
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
Get me a towel.

264
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:28,660
You have got up.

265
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,170
I'll go get a towel.

266
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:31,540
Here you are.

267
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:32,730
Thank you.

268
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,260
You're welcome.

269
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,450
Sister, this is the towel for feet.

270
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,220
Sorry, I took the wrong one.

271
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,540
Dad, what are you looking for?

272
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:45,920
I am looking for medicine.

273
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,620
Have you caught a cold?

274
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,480
Maybe

275
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,480
I caught a chill.

276
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,150
Do your things.

277
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,340
I won't take you to the station.

278
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,890
Dad, what did you say?

279
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,260
I said that do your things.

280
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,690
Lu Zheng's car is here.

281
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:08,800
I'll go first.

282
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:10,540
Do your things.

283
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,980
Sister, I'm leaving.

284
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,460
Okay.

285
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,440
Dad, I'm leaving.

286
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,670
Luckily, my daughter responded quickly

287
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,140
and she pulled me.

288
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,930
Then the car crashed over.

289
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,980
That was close.

290
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,560
Lu Zheng's car is here.

291
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:50,690
I'll go first.

292
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,220
Do your things.

293
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,230
Dad,

294
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,610
can you do me a favor?

295
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,290
Say something to the recorder.

296
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,790
I'm the most handsome man in the world.

297
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,290
Not that.

298
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,200
I will say something and you will follow me.

299
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,190
What do you mean?

300
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,410
It's none of your business. Do me a favor.

301
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:15,910
Wait.

302
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,660
Let me cough.

303
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,400
Or, it will affect my condition.

304
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,270
No, no, no.

305
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:19,980
This is what I want.

306
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,070
I'll start recording.

307
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,430
Here we go.

308
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,900
The car was too fast.

309
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,260
It was heading towards the passageway.

310
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,940
The car was too fast.

311
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,100
It was heading towards the passageway.

312
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,540
My daughter and I were walking.

313
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,830
My daughter and I were walking.

314
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,700
Do your things.

315
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:46,380
Do your things.

316
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,210
Thank you, dad.

317
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,190
Thank you, dad.

318
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,270
You don't need to repeat this.

319
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:56,700
What do you mean?

320
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,830
Were my words recorded?

321
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:04,820
Do your things.

322
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,460
Pei Zhi, Pei Zhi.

323
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,190
I know who the person is

324
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:19,660
in the recording.

325
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,700
I know. That's my dad.

326
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:25,750
You mean

327
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,740
you know who the other person is.

328
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:29,520
It's my master.

329
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,600
I didn't know it at first.

330
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,990
Because Lin caught a cold.

331
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,210
His words were nasal

332
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:35,810
and he coughed seriously.

333
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,520
But now I'm very sure

334
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:38,330
it is Lin.

335
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,550
I was wondering

336
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,690
why the sounds were so familiar.

337
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:43,210
But when I was

338
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:43,890
in the Strawberry World,

339
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,830
I didn't expect that he was Master.

340
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,820
Because they didn't know each other.

341
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,930
But now in the Cheese World,

342
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,420
they knew each other long ago.

343
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,800
In 2013, in the Strawberry World,

344
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,520
my dad had a car accident.

345
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,710
I don't remember the exact date.

346
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,470
But it should be a few days

347
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:57,930
after my birthday.

348
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,150
The date can match.

349
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,700
The hit-and-run driver ran away.

350
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,520
Lin was fine at that time,

351
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,820
so we didn't call the police.

352
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,420
But there was a sequela.

353
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,670
So I didn't relate

354
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,480
the recording to this.

355
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,550
But now it seems that

356
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,060
Lin will have a car accident in the Cheese World too.

357
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,780
The recording shows that I can save him.

358
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,140
If I could save him,

359
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:15,940
he wouldn't suffer from

360
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,850
Alzheimer's disease.

361
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,210
Actually, there are many things that

362
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:19,840
we can change.

363
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:21,940
Xi,

364
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,110
now can you understand

365
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,300
why I want to stay here?

366
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:26,900
I must stop

367
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,220
the car accident that Lin will suffer.

368
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,350
But I have to

369
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,820
go back to the Strawberry World to take care of Lin.

370
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,820
If I miss February of next year,

371
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,020
I may never be able to go back.

372
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,270
But we have many ways

373
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,340
to save Lin in the Cheese World.

374
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,940
You don't have to go back.

375
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,370
You also said that

376
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,700
no matter how long we stay

377
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,180
in this world,

378
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,350
the time we return to the Strawberry World

379
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,340
is fixed.

380
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,380
In other words,

381
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:46,420
even if we get old and die

382
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:46,940
in this world,

383
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,020
we will still go back to

384
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,740
the time we came here,

385
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:49,680
right?

386
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,350
One experience

387
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,540
doesn't mean anything.

388
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:53,790
Besides, Lin is sick.

389
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,900
I can't take the risk.

390
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,990
We can only work together.

391
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,420
Are you going home with me?

392
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,170
I'm sorry.

393
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,150
I have a reason to stay.

394
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:10,810
You don't need to apologize.

395
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:13,680
I also have a reason

396
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,780
to go back.

397
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,140
It is basically like this.

398
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,640
I just hope that you can

399
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,280
talk to Director Zhou.

400
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:35,280
If

401
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,450
I can get the certificate earlier,

402
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,540
I will be relieved.

403
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,470
Thank you.

404
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,010
Since Principal Zhang has asked,

405
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,400
I will definitely help you.

406
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,540
You are a man of your word.

407
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,270
Since you said so,

408
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,380
I'll drink it up.

409
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,850
Well, Mr Lin,

410
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,370
doesn't talk much.

411
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,440
He...

412
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:02,560
is a math genius.

413
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,900
He didn't do anything else these years.

414
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:07,870
He has been doing

415
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,980
research on projects.

416
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:09,900
He likes being alone.

417
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:10,860
He's not good at socializing.

418
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,270
Don't you like drinking either?

419
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:15,940
He is thinking.

420
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,050
I don't know what's on his mind.

421
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:19,940
I respect

422
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,780
educated people like them.

423
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,100
Math?

424
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,180
I haven't figured it out since I was a kid.

425
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,310
Everyone has their own strengths.

426
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,800
Let's not talk about math.

427
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,500
As for doing business,

428
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,260
when have you ever earned little?

429
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,440
Let me tell you.

430
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,430
When I was in school,

431
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,130
my teacher

432
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,850
asked me to study math well.

433
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,020
We asked

434
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,340
what the use of math was.

435
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,310
We can use calculators

436
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,130
for grocery shopping now.

437
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,050
The teacher criticized me.

438
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,900
She said Math was useless,

439
00:18:59,220 --> 00:18:59,700
but

440
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,860
it could decide

441
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:03,860
where you buy vegetables.

442
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,410
Mr Lin,

443
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,530
you must be good at math.

444
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,450
Where do you usually buy vegetables?

445
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,770
You can drink,

446
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,580
but why did you stand up?

447
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,830
Come on. I will propose a toast.

448
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,370
Lin's brain

449
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,570
is active,

450
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,900
but he is lazy.

451
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,200
His children buy vegetables

452
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,310
and do housework.

453
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,180
He doesn't care about them.

454
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:41,890
Fine.

455
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,990
Let's toast for children's filial piety.

456
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:44,780
Cheers.

457
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,220
OK.

458
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,160
Come on.

459
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:46,770
For our children.

460
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,260
For the child.ren

461
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,380
For the children. Come on.

462
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:52,450
Come on.

463
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,000
Okay. Let's drink.

464
00:19:59,300 --> 00:19:59,940
Have some food.

465
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,500
Eat.

466
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,040
Class,

467
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,500
we will start

468
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,390
the application of the Law of Sines

469
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,140
and the Law of Cosines.

470
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,220
Let's look at this question.

471
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,090
In a city

472
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,390
under urban construction,

473
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:19,620
it demands changing

474
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,570
a triangle area

475
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,180
into a city park.

476
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:22,850
Have you ever thought that

477
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,650
what we're doing now

478
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,850
might harm Lin in the Cheese World?

479
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,340
Why?

480
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,060
Now we know that

481
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,350
February 22,

482
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,340
Lin will have a car accident.

483
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,280
The best way to avoid it now

484
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,420
is to make Lin stay at home

485
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,270
on that day.

486
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,540
Then there won't be a car accident.

487
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,950
He won't agree.

488
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,300
Lin will go to

489
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,060
an important academic meeting that day.

490
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,750
Then you need to force him.

491
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,210
You can rent a car for him.

492
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,010
As long as he doesn't walk, it will be fine.

493
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,930
Anyway, the easiest way now

494
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:49,990
is to change

495
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,140
Lin's action mode.

496
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,220
You also said that

497
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,250
this recording

498
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,210
was just a possibility

499
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,880
of the Cheese World.

500
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,270
If we don't

501
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,140
push it,

502
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,640
it may not happen.

503
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,190
On the contrary, your efforts

504
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,460
may lead to another result.

505
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:03,740
For example,

506
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,900
on the day of the car accident on February 22,

507
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,780
Lin will have a car accident,

508
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,950
but you will fail to save him.

509
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,660
Have you ever thought about this?

510
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,090
I'll follow him all day.

511
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,030
Accidents usually happen in a second.

512
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,350
Are you sure

513
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,300
you don't slack off

514
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,610
for 24 hours a day?

515
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,520
It's very risky.

516
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:26,830
You have to bet

517
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,180
safety of Lin in the Cheese World

518
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,900
and even your life.

519
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,230
So we can know that

520
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:32,890
it is approximately equal to...

521
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:33,550
If

522
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,260
you can't respond to it in time,

523
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,430
it's very likely that you and Lin

524
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,660
will be knocked down

525
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,200
by the drunk driver.

526
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:37,990
But no matter what,

527
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,100
I will desperately save him.

528
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,370
It's not about whether you are desperate or not.

529
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,160
You are not

530
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:41,910
100% sure now.

531
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:42,950
You aren't even

532
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,890
50 percent

533
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,450
sure.

534
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,300
We're having class.

535
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,220
You can talk outside if you have anything.

536
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,510
Let's talk outside.

537
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:15,910
Where was I?

538
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:16,900
Sir,

539
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,070
you asked them to talk outside.

540
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:21,770
Stop laughing.

541
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,650
I'll leave now.

542
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,870
Sorry for wasting your time.

543
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,420
I will remember

544
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,640
your thing.

545
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,580
Okay.

546
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,400
The bag.

547
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,530
Here it is.

548
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,300
The bag.

549
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,070
Take it.

550
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,650
The bag is on me.

551
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,290
Okay, thank you.

552
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,440
Don't mention it. We are friends.

553
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,730
Okay, got it.

554
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,170
Well,

555
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,940
remember to teach me how to buy vegetables.

556
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,310
Okay, buy vegetables.

557
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:50,700
Well,

558
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,740
your hair

559
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,340
doesn't look like a teacher's hair.

560
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,180
How can the leaders

561
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:57,990
It looks bad.

562
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,760
approve the school running permit?

563
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:00,470
He'll cut it tomorrow.

564
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,130
Yes.

565
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,930
I have told him.

566
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,940
I have told him several times.

567
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,240
I won't see you off, okay?

568
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:05,780
See you.

569
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,080
See you.

570
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:06,420
Be careful.

571
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,430
We are asking others for help.

572
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,370
Can you smile?

573
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,300
I tried really hard not to flip the table.

574
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,340
Fuck.

575
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,260
If I had known that it was so difficult to run a school,

576
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:23,950
I wouldn't have come here.

577
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,620
You used to be a hermit.

578
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,670
You're on your own. You can do whatever you want.

579
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,620
No one can control you.

580
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:32,770
Now, you're in society.

581
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,660
You have to beg for help.

582
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,380
You're in society.

583
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,140
What have you become?

584
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,540
What did you do?

585
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,810
You lost your hair style. Did you lose your posture too?

586
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,580
If it weren't for children...

587
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,620
Why wasn't I doing this for children?

588
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,160
I'm doing this for children.

589
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,950
Do it if you can.

590
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,580
You do it.

591
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,940
Why did I work so hard?

592
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,020
I did it for Lin Zhaoxi.

593
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,820
She's Qiu Yue's child after all.

594
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,550
You think you are...

595
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,400
You're...

596
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,230
I can't let you

597
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,100
make her a bad girl.

598
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,160
Tell me.

599
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:02,910
How did I

600
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,580
make her a bad girl?

601
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,620
What did I do?

602
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:06,270
When Lin Zhaoxi was young,

603
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,200
she was a good student.

604
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,280
She was good.

605
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,990
What's her score now?

606
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:10,630
Explain it.

607
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,340
It's a sudden change in puberty.

608
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,350
Go away.

609
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,390
Right? She is rebellious.

610
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,600
How can I make her obey?

611
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,630
Besides, grades don't mean everything.

612
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:19,290
My daughter is good.

613
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,020
At her age,

614
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,300
grades are everything.

615
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,080
You're an adult.

616
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,560
Why are you talking nonsense?

617
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,480
There are not many ways

618
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,060
in which people can change their fate.

619
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,670
What's the way of the lowest cost?

620
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:30,450
The college entrance exam.

621
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,670
So vulgar. OK.

622
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,250
So vulgar.

623
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,780
It's vulgar. I will help my child.

624
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,240
I will not eat. I will go.

625
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:41,660
Go!

626
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,730
Go!

627
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,500
Take it away.

628
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,340
Fuck.

629
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:47,700
Listen,

630
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,360
go back and cut

631
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,030
your hair.

632
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,390
That New Money was right.

633
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,780
Who dares to hand over the child to you?

634
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,610
You look like a troublemaker.

635
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,320
What's this?

636
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,610
This is called cool.

637
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,080
You know nothing.

638
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:58,180
Pack up the food.

639
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:01,410
You can't even afford to raise your children.

640
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:02,560
How can you be cool？

641
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,370
I'm not eating. I'm leaving.

642
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,900
If I can analyze

643
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,550
the exact time

644
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,750
the car accident takes place,

645
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,470
I will be highly alert

646
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,570
in a short time.

647
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,940
Then I will be confident to save Lin.

648
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,310
But now this recording

649
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,020
only has the date.

650
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,370
It doesn't have the exact time.

651
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,090
How can you know the exact time?

652
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:28,660
What about the location?

653
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,880
If I can analyze the location through the audio,

654
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:31,780
the effect will be the same.

655
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:32,900
I've analyzed

656
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:33,620
the whole recording.

657
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,220
I can even know

658
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,060
the model of the ambulance.

659
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:36,700
But it's meaningless.

660
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,000
Because there are this kind of ambulances

661
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,300
everywhere in the city.

662
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,710
And there's no clue to make sure the location

663
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,940
in the recording.

664
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,880
The only thing we know is that

665
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,060
there are trees on that road.

666
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,110
But this kind of roads

667
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:48,690
are everywhere.

668
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,300
Just give up.

669
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:00,550
How do you want to cut it?

670
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,030
Just cut it short.

671
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,450
Cut it short. Okay.

672
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,340
Cut this little bit, OK?

673
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:08,500
Make it shorter.

674
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:11,950
Is this OK?

675
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:14,580
You...

676
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,630
This...

677
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:19,390
This ... to this... Cut it all.

678
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,320
Here.

679
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:23,510
Uncle,

680
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,500
how long have you kept your hair?

681
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,340
Twenty years.

682
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,300
Twenty years?

683
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,380
Your hair is older than me.

684
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,170
Think about it carefully.

685
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,420
If you cut your hair,

686
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,230
you can't even extend it.

687
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,100
Don't regret it.

688
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:37,610
Cut it.

689
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:39,750
I cut it.

690
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:40,690
Cut it.

691
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,120
I really cut it.

692
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,320
Cut it.

693
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,070
My cloth.

694
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,210
What kind of person is this?

695
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,750
Hua Juan, you...

696
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,230
Do you think

697
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,120
I am happy these years?

698
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,580
You have to ask yourself.

699
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,640
What do you think?

700
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,000
As a bystander,

701
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:20,810
not bad.

702
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,670
Not bad means unhappy.

703
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,850
You can say that.

704
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:27,700
Why?

705
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:30,950
You're too demanding of yourself.

706
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,220
What do I demand of myself?

707
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:33,900
Academic grades.

708
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,950
My grades are like this.

709
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,890
How can I demand of myself?

710
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,110
When you were in primary school,

711
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,340
you were a genius in Olympic mathematics, right?

712
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,790
Later, when you were in grade 8 or 9,

713
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,970
your grades slightly dropped.

714
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,030
Some said girls were lacking future development

715
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,900
and something like girls really couldn't make it.

716
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:50,990
You were getting more and more unhappy.

717
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,780
So what's the relationship between them?

718
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:57,550
Sister, this is a mental problem.

719
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:58,900
You have idol burden.

720
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,060
Idol burden?

721
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,100
Since then,

722
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:03,740
you don't like to study.

723
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,270
You worked hard before

724
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,580
because your effort paid off.

725
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:07,910
But later you found that

726
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,670
no matter how hard you tried,

727
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,520
you couldn't surpass the past.

728
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,370
You even got worse.

729
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,630
Do you think you can be happy?

730
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:13,860
So,

731
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,290
what happened in my childhood

732
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,960
became my burden.

733
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:19,880
What did you say?

734
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,050
Nothing.

735
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:28,850
I am back.

736
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:31,050
You're back, dad.

737
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,200
You're back.

738
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,500
Let me do it.

739
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,100
-Can you do it? -Let me do it.

740
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,960
Let me do it.

741
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,490
Dad, where did you go?

742
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:48,440
I took a bath in the bathhouse.

743
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,540
What's wrong with dad today?

744
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:04,260
I don't know.

745
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,110
What's up?

746
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,380
What are you studying?

747
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:34,770
Nothing.

748
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,130
Date and place.

749
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,530
Are you writing a novel again?

750
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:39,860
No.

751
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,110
Xi, you...

752
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:50,990
Do you think that

753
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,020
I don't care about you?

754
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:59,140
Why do you ask this?

755
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,400
All these years,

756
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,400
your grades have been dropping.

757
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,980
Is it because we did not communicate enough

758
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,160
or I asked too much from you,

759
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:07,900
so you are under a lot of pressure?

760
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:11,500
I don't know.

761
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,480
But maybe that's not true.

762
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,640
I think as for learning,

763
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,980
you need to depend on yourself.

764
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,510
It has nothing to do with the external factors.

765
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,100
Besides, if I can't stand

766
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:24,940
this little pressure,

767
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,380
how can I go into society?

768
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:27,660
Fine,

769
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,140
you are my daughter.

770
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,830
Although you don't have good grades,

771
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,320
you're so eloquent in terms of major principles.

772
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,170
You are indeed my father.

773
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,310
Although you can't be a good father,

774
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,790
you are quite happy to slag off your daughter

775
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,370
every day.

776
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,190
Hearing you say that,

777
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,260
I feel better.

778
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,390
Really?

779
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,620
You'll suffer after I leave.

780
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:49,840
Where are you going?

781
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,270
To college.

782
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,720
When both of you go to college,

783
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,060
I'll be immortal.

784
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,700
Every day...

785
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,380
I will quit my job and

786
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,720
I will sleep at home every day.

787
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:02,660
Good.

788
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,150
No.

789
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,290
Aren't you worried at all?

790
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:07,630
What should I worry about?

791
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,990
With our financial situation,

792
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,240
if you go to college,

793
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,740
maybe you won't have enough money.

794
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,540
I am not worried.

795
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,230
I think as long as

796
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,820
you pay the tuition for the first year,

797
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,420
she can handle it herself.

798
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,180
Who is she?

799
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,410
Who is her?

800
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,490
Me, Lin Zhaoxi.

801
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,130
Having a daughter like you,

802
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:36,690
I feel comforting.

803
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:38,810
Watch your TV.

804
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,120
What are you studying?

805
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,220
Let me give you some advice.

806
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,020
Tell me.

807
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,020
When an ordinary person

808
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,530
competes with a genius,

809
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:55,530
can she win?

810
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:57,850
It

811
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,030
depends on the size and the weight.

812
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,230
I'm not talking about that kind of competition.

813
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,790
It's just a metaphor.

814
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,500
Did you quarrel with Pei Zhi?

815
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:09,230
How do you know it?

816
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,260
What do you think?

817
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:15,650
He's too smart.

818
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,580
I am nothing compared to him.

819
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,060
But,

820
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:21,770
if I must defeat him,

821
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:23,620
what can I do?

822
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,740
You can do nothing.

823
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,300
Haven't you heard of that sentence?

824
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:32,460
Love...

825
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,030
No.

826
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,030
What? I have to finish it.

827
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:35,370
Remember it.

828
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:35,940
I'm not talking about this.

829
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:36,450
Remember it.

830
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,020
Love is freedom,

831
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:38,470
understanding,

832
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,110
and tolerance.

833
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,690
Understand?

834
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,110
Don't laugh.

835
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:40,950
I'm serious.

836
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,630
I'm serious too.

837
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,280
Deal with

838
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,300
my serious thing first.

839
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:44,540
You're serious too.

840
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,660
Remember this.

841
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:49,850
Have you heard of

842
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,900
the invincible rules in gambling?

843
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,730
Why are you talking about gambling?

844
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,940
If we use this

845
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,730
winning probability formula...

846
00:32:59,300 --> 00:32:59,960
For example,

847
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,380
we take ten yuan

848
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,640
to bet on the sides of the coin.

849
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:03,840
Put it into the formula.

850
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:04,450
The probability of

851
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,660
you winning

852
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,010
and going bankrupt

853
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,020
is both 50 percent.

854
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,880
It's understandable, right?

855
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:11,830
But if you

856
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,550
do something

by three percent.

860

Put it into the formula.

861
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,230
Then the probability of winning will increase

862
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,070
from 50 percent

863
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,460
to 77 percent.

864
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,780
What does this have to do with my question?

865
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,310
Aren't you competing with

866
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,570
Pei Zhi?

867
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:26,460
You

a beginner

870
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,780
You are betting 21 points with the banker.

871
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,100
The probability of you winning

872
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,540
is only 49.5%.

873
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:35,830
But

874
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,870
if you keep gambling,

875
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,630
you will definitely lose the game.

876
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,990
But if you can remember the cards,

877
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:39,950
the result will be different.

878

will be 51 percent.

880
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,390
Then my chance of winning

881
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,770
can only increase a little.

882
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,150
Idiot, I have told you that

883
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:47,950
this is gambling.

884
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,400
You need to use the formula.

885
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,820
You just need to add

886
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,230
a little more chance of winning every day.

887
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,230
As long as you keep gambling,

888
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,310
your chance of winning

889
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:54,670
will become

890
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,140
99.75 percent.

891
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,670
That means you'll win for sure.

892
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,020
If you want to defeat Pei Zhi,

893

if you want to defeat the banker,

894
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,750
you will have to work hard

of winning every day.

897

Without you noticing it, the bet will be doubled.

a life you don't slack off,

and small accumulation every day

901
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,130
will be the final result.

902
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,900
This is your last way

903
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:14,699
to defeat the banker.

904

Am I handsome?

1029
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,930
Who taught you to be so greasy?

1030
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,980
Taking clothes off while you are singing.

1031
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,320
Are you performing a strip dance?

1032
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,620
I think he's showing how

1033
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,530
a homebody transforms to a trendy man.

1034
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,510
Although his intonation and dance

1035
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:06,260
are not very good,

1036
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,700
he is quite creative.

1037
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:08,630
Anyway,

1038
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,610
I won't let him pass.

1039
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,210
Attention, players.

1040
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,850
It's okay if you can't sing well.

1041
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,460
But don't be so greasy.

1042
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,000
I'm angry because of this.

1043
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:20,890
Teacher, then...

1044
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,560
You can leave.

1045
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,720
Can I finish this song?

1046
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,860
I don't want to hear it.

1047
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,660
Teacher, I beg you.

1048
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:31,580
My dad and my sister

1049
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,690
are watching the live streaming at home.

1050
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,360
I just want to finish this song.

1051
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,340
It is OK if I am not promoted.

1052
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,220
The previous performers have finished the songs.

1053
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:40,750
The judge has gone too far.

1054
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,650
She doesn't even let him finish.

1055
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:42,990
The judge has gone too far.

1056
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,150
She just wants to make herself happy.

1057
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:44,580
Yes.

1058
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,590
According to

1059
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:48,190
the principle of respecting each player,

1060
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,220
you can complete

1061
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,290
your song.

1062
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,190
But we can only start at

1063
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,300
where you stopped.

1064
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,620
You can't start over.

1065
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:57,540
OK.

1066
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,460
Thank you.

1067
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,110
♫Pain is nothing♫

1068
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,450
♫Wipe your tears. Don't be afraid♫

1069
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,880
♫At least, we still have dreams♫

1070
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,470
♫He said in the wind and the rain♫

1071
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,950
♫This pain is nothing♫

1072
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:22,010
♫Wipe your tears. Don't ask why♫

1073
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:27,220
This T-shirt looks good.

1074
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,010
Yes.

1075
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,970
My sister made this for me.

1076
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,900
Although it was roughly made,

1077
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:34,980
I like it.

1078
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,560
Originally, it was embroidered,

1079
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:38,400
"Come on, brother."

1080
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,060
Later, I used a red pen to change it into

1081
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,630
"Sister and brother, let's work hard together."

1082
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:45,920
Why doesn't he write about me?

1083
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,230
My sister

1084
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,540
is not happy recently,

1085
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,270
So I want to encourage her

1086
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:50,860
in this way.

1087
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:52,740
Is this the reason

1088
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,100
that you insisted on singing till the end?

1089
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,090
Yes.

1090
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,260
I have a brother.

1091
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,960
The relationship between my brother and I is closer than

1092
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,610
our relationship with our parents.

1093
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,550
I can understand love

1094
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,140
among siblings.

1095
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,110
Actually, my sister and I

1096
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,180
are not biological siblings.

1097
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,070
We grew up together

1098
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:13,750
in the orphanage.

1099
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,380
Both of you are orphans.

1100
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:18,130
Yes.

1101
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,660
We were close when we were young.

1102
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,140
Later, she found her biological father.

1103
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,240
She begged her father,

1104
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:27,910
my current father,

1105
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:28,830
to adopt me.

1106
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,310
Now the three of us

1107
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:32,530
are a very happy family.

1108
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:37,670
Although we don't have much money,

1109
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,380
I'm happy.

1110
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:40,730
I also hope that

1111
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:41,550
my dad and my sister

1112
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,540
can be happy forever.

1113
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,580
Even if we encounter some difficulties in life,

1114
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,350
as long as our family

1115
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:47,940
is together,

1116
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,460
it's no big deal.

1117
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,540
Why are you crying?

1118
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:00,990
You're not usually like this.
