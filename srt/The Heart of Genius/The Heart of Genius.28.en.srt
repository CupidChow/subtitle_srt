Look at Pei Zhi.

He stayed up one more day than me.

181
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,820
I slept on the first day, but he didn't.

182

It's fine.

183

Tell me.

enter the modeling competition?

186

I told you.

187
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,660
I was jealous to see you have fun.

188
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,180
I've known you for 20 years.

189

Tell me the truth.

190
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,180
The truth is I just miss it.

191

Yes.

At that time,

195

What kind of a person is my mom?

203
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,500
When I asked you,

204
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,920
you were reluctant to say.

205
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,540
You two are quite similar in characters.

206
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,630
You are both powerful,

I can't think of

anything else.

211

213
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:08,790

we would be busy until tomorrow night.

215
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,100
But now,

216
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,530
it seems that it should be almost finished by noon.

217
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,370

218

Not bad.

It's mainly to get the original feeling.

222

I'll change mine with you.

00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,100
or will you say

512
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,530
to the teacher that he or she shouldn't eat?

513
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,380
Just tell the teacher

514
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,670
your true thoughts.

515
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,610
Dear teachers.

516
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,510
I don't know

517
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,900
if something that happened before I was born

518
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,970
has much to do with

519
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,530
my postgraduate entrance exam today.

520
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,910
[2019 Postgraduate Entrance Exam]

521
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,910
[Interview Room for the Secondary Round]

522
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,780
But since my father

523
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,230
is involved in this matter,

524
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,180
I think

525
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,190
I should answer it seriously.

526
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,320
First of all, my father and I

527
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,100
have lived together for over 20 years.

528
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,540
I think I have the most right

529
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,360
to say what kind of person he is.

530
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,340
He can keep doing a research

531
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,510
for more than 20 years.

532
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,380
This has already shown me through actions

533
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,440
what passion is.

534
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,620
And I don't believe

535
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,310
such a person

536
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,470
could be a plagiarist.

537
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:39,840
I'm driven not only by emotion,

538
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,030
but also by rational logic.

539
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,640
You just said

540
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,120
life was complicated.

541
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,570
Maybe

542
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,940
he was just changed by life.

543
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,520
No matter what you say,

544
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,030
I'm sticking to my ideas.

545
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,980
Ms. Zhang, you've digressed from the subject.

546
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,190
That's all.

547
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:00,040
Lin Zhaoxi, sit down.

548
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,060
How was your interview?

549
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,620
What happened?

550
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,230
I didn't think it was because of me.

551
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,700
I didn't want to tell you.

552
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,220
You're carrying the burden

553
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,070
to yourself.

554
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,120
What's her name?

555
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,450
I don't know. Her surname...

556
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,030
Her surname is Zhang. Ms. Zhang.

557
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:51,790
Zhang Yan.

558
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,980
I've read all the teachers' information.

559
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,900
I know her.

560
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,580
She's also Professor Zeng's student.

561
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,900
She knows your mother too.

562
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,780
She's not bad.

563
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,580
But she's stubborn.

564
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,550
Maybe her brain

565
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,020
has all been used on researches.

566
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,230
I'm not afraid of failing.

567
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,620
But at that time,

568
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,810
I couldn't stand others criticizing you.

569
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:18,340
I feel bad.

570
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,940
Just let her say. I won't lose any part of my body.

571
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,210
Master.

572
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,600
What happened back then?

573
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,260
Back then,

574
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,980
my postgraduate thesis

575
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,350
and the thesis of Professor Feng

576
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,900
from Yongchuan University

577
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,960
were quite similar.

578
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,640
The university

579
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,290
thought I copied her thesis

580
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:45,920
and kicked me out.

581
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,140
Professor Feng?

582
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,480
Professor Feng Ming

583
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,470
studied discrete mathematics.

584
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,420
Do you know her?

585
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,940
I've read her books.

586
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,020
She's an excellent female mathematician.

587
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,100
When you wrote it,

588
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:58,780
didn't you know

589
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:00,310
she had a similar thesis?

590
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,000
Our theses

591
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,270
were sent to review at the same time.

592
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,830
They were not published.

593
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,900
But if they were not published,

594
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:09,620
what was the evidence

595
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,740
that proved the plagiarism?

596
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:13,140
There was no evidence. The two were just similar.

597
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,140
Maybe

598
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,550
she plagiarized you.

599
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,340
She was a famous professor.

600
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,550
But there are also cases

601
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,340
of professors plagiarizing students' work.

602
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,000
But the key point is

603
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:23,780
the master

604
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,900
studied at Sanwei University.

605
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,830
She was in Yongchuan University.

606
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:27,910
These two universities

607
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,500
are not even in the same city.

608
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,300
Master, did you submit your thesis

609
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,290
to any academic magazine?

610
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,370
Well, stop guessing.

611
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,020
I've already had a conclusion about this.

612
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,530
It was just a coincidence.

613
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,340
There was no plagiarist.

614
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,500
Our research content and field

615
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,500
were too similar.

616
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:48,340
It's common

617
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,020
in the academic field.

618
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,620
But even the time was the same.

619
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,540
What a coincidence.

620
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,060
Your idea is the same

621
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,490
as the school committee's back then.

622
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,610
So I was unlucky.

623
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,010
Did she really not plagiarize you?

624
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,780
No, she didn't.

625
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,420
Besides,

626
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,350
Professor Feng...

627
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,340
Professor Feng wouldn't do such a thing.

628
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,350
I'm sure.

629
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,110
Did you know her well?

630
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:17,970
Let's not talk about this.

631
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,660
It's been over 20 years.

632
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,290
It won't solve the current problem

633
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,850
if we make that thing clear.

634
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,300
Pei Zhi.

635
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,140
Why don't we find Professor Zeng

636
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,610
and ask him for help?

637
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,260
No, no, no.

638
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,410
Dad, forget it.

639
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,460
Don't give up. You worked so hard.

640
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,650
I said forgot it.

641
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,420
Really.

642
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,140
It's not a big deal.

643
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,500
Besides,

644
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,300
the interview result hasn't been out,

645
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:41,860
right?

646
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:43,180
Forget it.

647
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,310
Well.

648
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,010
Pei Zhi and I

649
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,170
will go out to buy some books.

650
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,650
The modeling competition is about to begin.

651
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:49,490
Let's get ready.

652
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:00,410
We can't just let it go.

653
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,250
We must figure it out.

654
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,310
Go to the library.

655
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,130
Check yearbooks of the university.

656
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,020
But I don't have the student card of Sanwei University.

657
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,820
Just borrow it from Wang.

658
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,530
How dare you stop me?

659
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,130
The step-back. A three-point shot.

660
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:30,190
You can play. I'm tired.

661
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,620
No. I don't know how to play.

662
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:33,920
You don't know how to play?

663
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,220
It's okay. I'll teach you. Come on.

664
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,410
I'm too stupid to learn.

665
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,180
Mr. Wang.

666
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,420
The card. Thank you.

667
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:46,140
Pei Zhi?

668
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:47,620
Zhang Liang.

669
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,120
Why are you here?

670
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,070
Who are you?

671
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,210
I'm your middle school alumni.

672
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:56,700
I don't know you.

673
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,440
Why do you come to Sanwei University?

674
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,260
He's going back to Sanwei University.

675
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,680
Are you also a candidate this year?

676
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,810
Come on, call me the senior.

677
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,170
You have taken the postgraduate entrance exam?

678
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,670
Sanwei University?

679
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:08,780
Yes.

in school all day

One is too hot and the other is too cold.

If we want the temperature

923

of the two glasses of water becomes similar,

924
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,020
we need to mix them.

ask about

Actually, I don't know much.

961
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,780
You should go to Yongchuan University.

962
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,360

Professor Feng

974
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,020
didn't get

976
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,200
Why did the university think

977
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,690
my dad was a plagiarist?

978
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:03,720
Was it really

979
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,050
because of similar theses?

Professor Feng

981
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,520
gave us a lot of pressure.

We wrote the same thing.

I say you copied mine.

did nothing wrong.

1010
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,100
There were two reasons.

1011
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:44,660
First,

1012
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,380
Professor Feng

1013
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,210
was a highly respected scholar.

1014
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:50,150
Her words

1015
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:51,360
were more credible.

1016
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,740
But shouldn't the university

1017
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,940
protect students?

1018
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,710
Another reason was that this

1019
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,130
