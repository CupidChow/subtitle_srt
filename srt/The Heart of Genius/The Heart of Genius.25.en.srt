00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,140
What's wrong, mom?

176
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,450
You've been with me these days.

177
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,620
Will Hai be okay with it?

178
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,090
It's OK. Don't worry.

179
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,740
I told him I'll stay at home for two days.

180
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:29,940
What's wrong?

181
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,430
Do you remember Uncle Qian?

182
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:35,400
Your classmate.

183
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,280
He opened a small shop,

184
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,830
and wants me to help.

185
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:40,740
Mom.

186
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,260
Is the living expense I gave you

187
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:43,940
not enough?

188
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,490
No, I don't need money.

189
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,110
It's boring for me

190
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,240
to stay at home alone.

191
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,540
I'm only in my forties.

192
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,300
I can't dance on public squares

193
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,140
for the next 30 years.

194
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:57,920
Right.

195
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,250
[What are you doing?]

196
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,840
Who?

197
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:09,990
A trainee.

198
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,990
[Pei Zhi]

199
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,990
[Yes.]

200
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,750
[What are you doing?]

201
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,750
[Yes.]

202
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,300
Yes?

203
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,130
Just say yes?

204
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,560
What does that mean?

205
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,720
He doesn't want to talk to me,

206
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,320
but can't ignore me.

207
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,230
[What are you doing?]

208
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,230
[Yes.]

209
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,510
If it's urgent,

210
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,730
you can go back first.

211
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,610
It's okay. I'm done.

212
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,470
Mom, go on.

213
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:46,630
I'm done.

214
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,260
What do you think?

215
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,030
Will it be too hard?

216
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,140
No.

217
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,120
I'll just keep accounts for them.

218
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,650
It's just a small shop

219
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,610
selling clothes.

220
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,840
It is not in the downtown.

221
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,700
How hard can it be?

222
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,470
I just want to find something to do.

223
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,570
Someone can talk to me during the day.

224
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,100
Okay, you can go if you want.

225
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,350
But

226
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,180
if you don't like it,

227
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,280
don't force yourself.

228
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,050
Don't worry.

229
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,430
Go. Go back to your work.

230
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,020
Okay.

231
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,310
Pei Zhi.

232
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,230
What are you reading?

233
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,060
Boxing magazine.

234
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,940
OK. Go ahead.

235
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,340
Mom, I won't disturb you.

236
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,860
I was chatting with my mom just now.

237
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:57,370
[What are you doing?]

238
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:57,370
[Yes.]

239
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:00,810
[I was chatting with my mom just now. I am reading. What about you?]

240
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,340
I am reading. What about you?

241
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:09,100
[I'm doing my test paper.]

242
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,860
I'm doing my test paper.

243
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,950
[I'm doing my test paper.]

244
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,950
[Let's watch a movie tomorrow.]

245
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,340
Let's watch a movie tomorrow.

246
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,470
[I'm doing my test paper.]

247
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,470
[I'm doing my test paper.]

248
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,470
[Let's watch a movie tomorrow.]

249
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,310
[I'm doing my test paper.]

250
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,310
[Let's watch a movie tomorrow.]

251
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,310
[OK.]

252
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,250
OK.

253
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,330
Dad, tomorrow...

254
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,000
What are you doing?

255
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,280
Ant.

256
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,760
The ant is lost.

257
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,980
Don't scare me.

258
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,310
Do you remember me?

259
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,240
I'm fine.

260
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,750
My mind is clear.

261
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,590
You scared me.

262
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,480
What are you looking at?

263
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,400
I'm sorting out my thesis.

264
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,990
But I don't understand my own thesis.

265
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,980
They're my own thesis.

266
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,720
I must be really sick.

267
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,980
My math career is over.

268
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,670
I'm going to retire early soon.

269
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,260
What can I do in the future?

270
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:11,940
It's okay.

271
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,910
Just treat the disease.

272
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:18,880
You told me

273
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,650
it's not a big deal.

274
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,310
Just treat the disease.

275
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,080
Xi.

276
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,060
Will you hate me

277
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,650
if your dad is an idiot?

278
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,880
What are you talking about? Think about it.

279
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,050
You've raised a little fool like me

280
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,650
for over 20 years.

281
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,840
Why will I hate you?

282
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,750
Can you get up?

283
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,980
You're making my stomach ache.

284
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,610
You are

285
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,040
much heavier now.

286
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,880
Don't mention it.

287
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,940
That means I raised you well.

288
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,460
Are you raising pigs, dad?

289
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,720
The heavier, the better, right?

290
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,220
I wanted to lie to you

291
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,890
that I'm fine.

292
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,600
Then you could focus on study.

293
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,710
I couldn't control myself.

294
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,500
You've been hiding it from me for five years.

295
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,440
You want to keep it from me for five years?

296
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,100
Besides,

297
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,540
you just can't

298
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,250
study math anymore.

299
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,860
But I'm here.

300
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,820
I can't understand the thesis now.

301
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,560
In the future,

302
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:44,740
I may be lonely and depressed.

303
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,140
Maybe there will be illusions.

304
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,610
I'll hide things and hide poop.

305
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,550
I know. I checked those online.

306
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,900
Will you...

307
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,260
No, no, no.

308
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,200
How many times do you want me to repeat it?

309
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:04,430
I...

310
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,420
No matter what you become,

311
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,040
you're still my most talented

312
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,820
and beloved old guy.

313
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,990
"Guy" will do. Remove the word "old".

314
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,490
I just don't want to burden you.

315
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,020
When I was little,

316
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,340
you could go abroad to study.

317
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,540
To raise me,

318
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,120
you gave up the opportunity.

319
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,990
Did you think I was a burden?

320
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,520
To be honest, a little.

321
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,750
Then why did you stay?

322
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:38,980
That's because

323
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,120
you looked funny.

324
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,160
Do you regret it?

325
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,040
No.

326
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:51,990
I had a dream.

327
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,250
And

328
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,190
I asked you the same question

329
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,210
in my dream.

330
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,540
Do you know your answer?

331
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,339
You said

332
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:08,460
raising me

333
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,099
makes you feel

334
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,450
you're alive.

335
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,829
It sounds like what I said.

336
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,430
So, Lin,

337
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:26,030
it's my turn to take care of you now.

338
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,590
I'm really motivated now.

339
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,760
I'll learn math well

340
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,830
and walk the path you haven't finished.

341
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:35,740
And

342
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,260
make money to support the family.

343
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,260
I'll hire the best nurse

00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:12,880
Today,

866
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,610
I watched a movie

867
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,030
with Pei Zhi.

868
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,230
Then,

869
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,950
he went to the postgraduate course with me.

870
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,660
There's another very important thing.

871
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,620
You won't expect it.

872
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:22,870
Guess what it is.

873
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:25,170
Pei Zhi will study math again.

874
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,340
Why are you

875
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,760
so cold?

876
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,270
It's not what I thought.

877
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,560
Didn't you always want him

878
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,620
to study math?

879
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,200
I want to tell you something.

880
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,190
What is it?

881
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:45,330
Don't tell me

882
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,660
my mom is a rich woman.

883
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:48,920
She's alive and wants to take me away.

884
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,470
No. Don't make fun of your mom.

885
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,100
You look so serious.

886
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:54,890
I'm nervous.

887
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,090
We went bankrupt.

888
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,080
Nothing else?

889
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:10,240
I thought it'll be a big deal.

890
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,660
It's not that we're very rich

891
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,980
and we suddenly went bankrupt.

892
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,810
We're poor all the time.

893
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,430
We don't have much money.

894
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,890
And now I'm jobless.

895
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,700
It costs a lot of money to see the doctor.

896
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:25,640
Don't think about it. I've thought about it.

897
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,630
After I finish my postgraduate exam,

898
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,580
I'll go to work.

899
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,130
That won't work.

900
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:29,910
You need to study.

901
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,820
I can work.

902
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:32,280
Why not?

903
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,700
Look at your daughter.

904
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,940
She's young and she graduated from a prestigious university.

905
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:37,980
She has hands and feet.

906
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,550
How come I can't support our family?

907
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,100
You are discriminating.

908
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:43,000
What? I don't want to waste your energy.

909
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:43,680
Listen.

910
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:44,980
I lack everything now.

911
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:45,940
But I don't lack energy.

912
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,720
I am

913
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,790
a high-speed car.

914
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,720
I can't stop.

915
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,620
Really.

916
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:54,810
You have no idea

917
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,940
how many things have happened

918
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,570
since you were unconscious.

919
00:39:59,300 --> 00:39:59,920
But...

920
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,240
But I made it.

921
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,340
You're awake.

922
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,800
I'm going to take

923
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:09,860
the postgraduate exam for math.

924
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,190
Pei Zhi also came back to study math.

925
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,300
There's nothing

926
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,180
can't be overcome.

927
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,720
With all your efforts,

928
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,960
never slack in your life.

929
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,120
The small accumulation

930
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,250
determines the final result.

931
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:29,870
This is my courage

932
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,560
to face all difficulties.

933
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,970
Anyway, let me make it clear.

934
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,430
I will take good care of my family

935
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,260
and pass the postgraduate entrance exam.

936
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,060
As for you,

937
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,500
just play chess every day,

938
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,120
take a walk

939
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,190
and live a peaceful life.

940
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,920
What's wrong? Why aren't you saying anything?

941
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,510
I think

942
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,390
you

943
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,630
suddenly grew up.

944
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,410
The tuition fee is 8,000 times 3.

945
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,190
Living expenses,

946
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,940
1,500 times 36.

947
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:47,670
The extra charge,

948
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,720
500 times 36.

949
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,510
Love expenses,

950
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,060
800 times 36.

951
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,300
The risk prevention is 20,000.

952
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,690
144,800 in total.

953
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,170
144,800.

954
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:26,860
I'm sorry.

955
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:27,820
This bag is fake.

956
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:28,640
We won't accept it.

957
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,220
It's fake?

958
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,280
How is that possible?

959
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,260
I have the receipt.

960
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,360
This receipt is also fake.

961
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,270
What about this?

962
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,460
I'm sorry.

963
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,550
This is also fake.

964
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,780
You may go somewhere else.
