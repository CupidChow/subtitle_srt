00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:11,930
So,

514
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,780
we need to strategically give up

515
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,450
some difficult parts.

516
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:15,950
Do you understand?

517
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,020
But technically, you need to

518
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,600
lay a solid foundation for your study,

519
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,690
especially for solid geometry.

520
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:20,700
Do you know?

521
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,610
In the test for students of humanity subject and art,

522
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,820
the questions of solid geometry

523
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,680
are the easiest.

524
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,040
Dad.

525
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:27,900
What are you talking about?

526
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,110
Why are you up?

527
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,620
I can't sleep.

528
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,130
Feeling better?

529
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,300
I'm fine now.

530
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:35,380
Don't sit there. It's cold.

531
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:35,820
Here.

532
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,810
Well, by the way,

533
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,690
let's have a family meeting.

534
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,760
I've been thinking about

535
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,980
opening a tutoring class.

536
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,430
Why do you suddenly want to start a class?

537
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,640
You two are going to college later,

538
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,910
I'm bored at home.

539
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,900
So I'll kill time by making some money.

540
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,210
You cut your hair because of this?

541
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:56,850
No.

542
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,260
It's convenient to keep short hair.

543
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,100
And when you

544
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,060
write something on the blackboard,

545
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,340
the dust of the chalk will fall on your hair if it's too long.

546
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,500
When the class starts,

547
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,510
do you still have the energy to study math?

548
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,300
I spent half of my life on it, but I didn't make any progress.

549
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,770
It’s better to make some money.

550
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,100
Zhang Shuping is the principal of a middle school.

551
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,090
I have to be better than him.

552
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,650
Lin, I still hope

553
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,820
you can do

554
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,700
what you like.

555
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:21,210
Yes, dad.

556
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,340
After I go to college,

557
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,340
I can make money on my own.

558
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,300
Our teacher said

559
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,790
if I can go to an art school,

560
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,380
there are many jobs that can make money.

561
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,220
You are all good kids.

562
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,990
I indulged myself too much.

563
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,130
I raised you for six years.

564
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,800
I'm still so carefree.

565
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,070
Fine.

566
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:35,820
Let me tell you.

567
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,180
In our heart, you are the best father of the entire country...

568
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,860
of the whole city?

569
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,430
Of this alley?

570
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,930
You the best father in the alley.

571
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,700
Why don't you say I'm the best father in the whole family?

572
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,410
I'm the only one.

573
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,940
Dad, I'm afraid,

574
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,600
in the future,

575
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:48,860
you have to give this title to me

576
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,740
when I have a child.

577
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,050
Fine, take it.

578
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,380
Anyway, I think

579
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,060
there's still one year left before college.

580
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:54,940
Give it a second thought.

581
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:55,590
Right.

582
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,220
Maybe we will

583
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,470
win the lottery one day.

584
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,860
Alright. I've made up my mind.

585
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:00,970
We'll open the tutoring class another day.

586
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,060
You're dismissed.

587
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:03,490
Go to bed.

588
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,020
Hello, Principal Zhang.

589
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,020
How are you feeling?

590
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,380
Much better.

591
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,980
Yes, my dad told me

592
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,040
you helped us in a lot of things.

593
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:43,520
Thank you.

594
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,700
You are

595
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:45,610
my student.

596
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,500
It's my duty to protect my students.

597
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,280
One more thing.

598
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,070
Your dad resigned.

599
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,820
He won't come to work next week.

600
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,380
Do you know?

601
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:55,910
I know.

602
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,500
He said he wanted to open a tutoring class.

603
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,660
Finally he decided.

604
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,020
Good. Good.

605
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,260
Good.

606
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,580
There is no way you could get it.

607
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,150
Give it to me.

608
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,730
Are you okay?

609
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,180
I'm fine.

610
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,420
Pei Zhi,

611
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,010
now that I could return here safely,

612
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,390
I should say thank you for letting me go.

613
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,020
Are you mocking me for being too cruel?

614
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,660
No.

615
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:43,810
I went too far.

616
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:44,610
As you wish.

617
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,740
My dad has returned to the traffic police force.

618
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,260
And he has become

619
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,260
a joke in his team.

620
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,200
Really?

621
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,710
Please send my apology to

622
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:52,380
uncle Pei.

623
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:52,940
Okay.

624
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:55,860
Please send my apology

625
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,640
to uncle Lin as well.

626
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,740
What are you sorry for?

627
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,740
With the 5 million pressure,

628
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,100
he can't focus on

629
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:02,890
studying math anymore.

630
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,140
I changed his fate.

631
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,350
What 5 million?

632
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,840
It seems that he hasn't told you.

633
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,000
Pei Zhi said you owe him five million.

634
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:28,810
What happened?

635
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:30,740
It's just an IOU.

636
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,000
It's no big deal.

637
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,330
Why did you promise

638
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,160
such thing to him?

639
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,300
It's all because of you.

640
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,460
It's just five million yuan.

641
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:41,260
Not a big deal.

642
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,900
Did you run the tutoring class

643
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,000
to redeem me?

644
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,540
What do you mean by that?

645
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,080
It's like you're kidnapped.

646
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:50,980
Zhang Shuping and I

647
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,240
have discussed it.

648
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,020
We're prepared.

649
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,240
But you have never made up your mind

650
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,770
until this happened.

651
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,540
No.

652
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,380
It's good to be a teacher.

653
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,220
And your hair.

654
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,120
You cut it because of this?

655
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:06,910
Am I handsome?

656
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:09,890
Am I handsome?

657
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,840
[Fight for the College Entrance Examination]

658
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,900
Come here. Hurry.

659
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,490
Did they quarrel again?

660
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,100
Why?

661
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,920
Why did you ask Lin to write an IOU?

662
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:30,990
For money.

663
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,840
I only have one goal.

664
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,690
Can't you guess?

665
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,660
You asked old Lin to give up his study on math,

666
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,340
so that he wouldn't go to the seminar,

667
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:40,620
and he wouldn't have met

668
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,700
that drunk driver.

669
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,880
What you need to do

670
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,020
is like making a house with building blocks.

671
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,700
You have to put every piece of them in the right place

672
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,700
to complete it.

673
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,160
And my task is simple.

674
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,740
As long as I take out any piece of those building blocks,

675
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,670
the entire house will collapse.

676
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:51,700
As long as Lin

677
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,190
doesn't attend this seminar,

678
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,460
the track of his life will be changed.

679
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,420
Naturally,

680
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,080
the car accident can be avoided.

681
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,350
You are his student.

682
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,460
You know how much he loves math.

683
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,650
Why did you do that?

684
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,250
Don't you want to go back to the Strawberry World?

685
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,140
Don't you think

686
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,110
old Lin in this world

687
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,330
is not your real father?

688
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,580
Why do you care so much?

689
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,970
You shouldn't get Lin involved.

690
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,150
In the Strawberry World,

691
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,290
Master

692
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,620
spent extra

693
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,310
six years on math.

694
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:17,990
In the end, he didn't make any achievement.

695
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,260
Everything he did, including

696
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,340
this seminar of NPC problem,

697
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,420
is meaningless.

698
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,300
So?

699
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,990
That's because Lin was sick.

700
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,300
In this world, Lin is healthy.

701
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,500
He can keep on.

702
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,500
How can you be sure

703
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,650
he won't succeed?

704
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,200
And is the result that important?

705
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,620
Why isn't the result important?

706
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,540
A mathematician

707
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,300
studied his problem all his life,

708
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,300
but it didn't work out.

709
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,660
Do you think he'll be happy?

710
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,140
Won't he feel frustrated?

711
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:37,860
No.

712
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,700
He will sing and scold life,

713
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,140
laughing and saying that exploring the unknown

714
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:41,980
is the happiness itself.

715
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:43,860
This is old Lin.

716
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:57,270
[Fighting for the College Entrance Examination]

717
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,290
[Fighting for the College Entrance Examination]

718
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:03,770
[Constantly strive for better perfection]

719
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,350
I announce that

720
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:18,540
the first expanded meeting of the leading Group

721
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:19,700
for saving the relationship

722
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:22,140
between Lin Zhaoxi and Pei Zhi

723
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,860
begins now.

724
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:25,980
Wait.

725
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:28,450
Why is he here?

726
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,870
None of your business

727
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,020
Are you a friend of Lin Zhaoxi

728
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,880
and Pei Zhi?

729
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,580
Pei Zhi and I are neighbors since childhood.

730
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:36,010
Tianming.

731
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,620
The expanded meeting means that

732
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,760
we should unite

733
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,740
everyone we could.

734
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,180
Just think that he is here to make the team bigger.

735
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:43,570
No.

736
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,580
If I hadn't

737
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,120
owe Lu Zhihao a favor,

738
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,020
you don't deserve

739
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,100
to have a meeting with me.

740
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:48,700
What did you say?

741
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,500
Enough.

742
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:49,860
What's wrong?

743
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,220
You two always fight each other.

744
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,790
Haven't you fought enough on the basketball playground?

745
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,330
When my arm recovers,

746
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,300
you may have another battle.

747
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,700
Can you just stop now?

748
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,940
Since you hurt your arm,

749
00:29:59,010 --> 00:29:59,820
I'll spare you.

750
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,050
The weak

751
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,190
only know how to talk.

752
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,410
Here's the situation.

753
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,220
Lin Zhaoxi and Pei Zhi

754
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,620
won't talk to each other.

755
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,090
They even quarreled when they met.

756
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,240
Pei Zhi

757
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,860
has always been the top student.

758
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,340
He helped Lin Zhaoxi in study.

759
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,060
But after Lin Zhaoxi

760
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,250
made huge progress in her exam scores,

761
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,460
the weaker one became the stronger one.

762
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,380
They changed from friends

763
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:26,850
to enemies

764
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,530
on the rank list.

765
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,980
There's a crack in their friendship.

766
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:34,780
Wait.

767
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:36,220
I'm Pei Zhi's

768
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,010
competitor.

769
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:41,740
In order to prove that he's better,

770
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,680
Pei Zhi used

771
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,900
his spare time

772
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,960
to start a business successfully.

773
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,060
Lin Zhaoxi was jealous.

774
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,230
She destroyed

775
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,120
Pei Zhi's business plan,

776
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,210
and Pei Zhi sued her.

777
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,660
But Pei Zhi

778
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,690
stopped it in time because of their old friendship.

779
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,700
That's why

780
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,170
things became like this.

781
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,590
The facts have proven that

782
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,620
it's hard for two excellent people

783
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,780
to be together.

784
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,060
Hold on.

785
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:09,610
Is your analysis reliable?

786
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,540
Absolutely.

787
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,910
We are in the same class.

788
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:13,980
We've been observing for a long time.

789
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,200
What are you going to do?

790
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,490
We don't want them to break up.

791
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,580
But we should find

792
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,590
a good method to persuade them.

793
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,720
It's impossible

794
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,490
to talk to them directly.

795
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,710
I think

796
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:29,100
we should ask them out,

797
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,880
create a relaxing environment,

798
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,700
and convince them patiently

799
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,820
until they open their hearts.

800
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,000
What do you think?

801
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,890
It sounds good.

802
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,340
I agree.

803
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,580
Me too.

804
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,220
Me too.

805
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:43,780
Me too.

806
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,220
Okay.

807
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,420
If you

808
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,500
have no objection,

809
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,660
I'll assign the task.

810
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,670
We'll act on Saturday.

811
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,100
We can text each other later.

812
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,540
Okay, no problem.

813
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:54,010
Okay.

814
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:54,900
Call me.

815
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:58,290
This way.

816
00:31:58,910 --> 00:31:59,650
Coming.

817
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,570
Here you are.

818
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:01,900
Come on.

819
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:02,620
Sit here.

820
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,100
Come.

821
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:03,660
Come on.

822
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,300
Come and sit here, Zhaoxi.

823
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:04,750
Xi.

824
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,100
Don't block her.

825
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:06,260
Come, sit here.

826
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:06,940
Have a seat.

827
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,500
Sit.

828
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,770
Have a seat.

829
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,150
Take a seat.

830
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:19,870
Today is a holiday.

831
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:20,850
so I asked you out

832
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,100
to relax.

833
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,100
Let's play “You Draw and I Guess”. It's an old game.

834
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,210
OK.

835
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,300
Let's divide us into some groups first.

836
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,000
Okay.

837
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,230
Zhang Liang and I will be in one group, we are in the same class.

838
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,860
And Bao Xiaomeng. And you.

839
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:34,880
We four are in a group.

840
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:35,900
The rest of us,

841
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,040
Sun Wenqi, Lin Zhaoxi.

842
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:37,990
Pei Zhi, and you,

843
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:38,870
you four are in a group.

844
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,390
I'll be the referee.

845
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,750
Let's talk about the rules.

846
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,340
The one who get the question

847
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,500
will draw on the white board.

848
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:45,820
Try to

849
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,420
make your teammate understand what you are painting,

850
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,180
and make sure that the other team can't figure out what it is.

851
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:49,900
Understand?

852
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,280
Yes.

853
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,530
Let's start.

854
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:53,450
Who goes first?

855
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,810
Xi, you go first.

856
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:55,670
Me?

857
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:56,760
Okay.

858
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,460
Take a card.

859
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,600
A matchstick man?

860
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,590
Matchstick man?

861
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,720
What is this?

862
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:15,940
He is bald.

863
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:19,390
Harry Potter!

864
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,000
How is it possible

865
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:21,380
that this is Harry Potter?

866
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,630
This doesn't look like Harry Potter.

867
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,620
[Harry Potter]

868
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,830
It's really Harry Potter.

869
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,640
It doesn't look like him.

870
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:29,800
It's just a person with a bald head.

871
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,090
You should at least draw some hair

872
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:31,890
and put a lightening-shaped scar

873
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,200
on his forehead.

874
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:33,790
Yes.

875
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,290
I didn't have time to draw.

876
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:35,990
I...

877
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,480
How did you guess that?

878
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,800
He has a magic stick in his left hand,

879
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:40,900
and a pair of round glasses.

880
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:41,600
That means he's Harry Potter.

881
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,210
This is a wand?

882
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,380
Isn't this a whip?

883
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,800
I almost believed that it's Mr. Xie.

884
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,250
Good.

885
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,640
-I thought that was a torch.- He is similar with Harry Potter.

886
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,850
One more round. I'm not convinced.

887
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,620
Me too. Again.

888
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:50,270
One more round.

889
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,700
The winner should paint this time.

890
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,730
Let Pei Zhi do it, the winner should do it.

891
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,460
Me?

892
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:54,720
Take a card.

893
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,400
I'll draw now.

894
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,180
Okay.

895
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:08,980
Four words.

896
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,870
Kitten.

897
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:18,540
Rabbit.

898
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:19,340
"Wait for the rabbits come to you under a tree" (an idiom)?

899
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:20,500
No.

900
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,290
Spicy rabbit head(name of a dish)!

901
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,400
What is spicy rabbit head?

902
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,100
No wonder you go to Class 13.

903
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,580
Killing the hound dog after it gets the rabbit(an idiom).

904
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,270
How is that possible

905
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,210
that this means "killing the hound dog after it gets the rabbit"?

906
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:34,409
What does this phrase mean?

907
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,780
It is killing the hound dog after it gets the rabbit.

908
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:36,989
[Killing the hound dog after it gets the rabbit]

909
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,239
It's true!

910
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,100
This is amazing.

911
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,940
It has nothing to do with dogs.

912
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,679
The rabbit was shot,

913
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,460
it means there was a hunter.

914
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,280
The hunter boiled a pot of water,

915
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:46,420
if it was drawn

916
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:47,400
below the rabbit,

917
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,500
it means he wanted to cook the rabbit.

918
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,190
But he drew it

919
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:50,040
next to the rabbit,

920
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:50,929
so he wanted to cook something else.

921
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,060
Therefore I thought it's

922
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,920
killing the hound dog after it gets the rabbit.

923
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,100
Awesome.

924
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:55,580
How is that possible?

925
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,300
This is amazing.

926
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,100
What a nice tacit understanding.

927
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:03,780
You two are so in sync.

928
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:04,970
Originally,

929
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,910
we made you two team up on purpose.

930
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,300
I would pretend I couldn't guess it,

931
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,710
so that you two will seem to be suitable.

932
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,290
I didn't expect you two made the picture too difficult,

933
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,700
I really can't guess it, no matter how hard I tried.

934
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,930
I didn't have to pretend.

935
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,340
I think so too.

936
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,740
It's just luck.

937
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:17,910
It has nothing to do with tacit understanding.

938
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:18,900
I think it's tacit understanding.

939
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,580
Pei Zhi said it's tacit understanding.

940
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,220
Here I am.

941
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:25,660
Sorry, I'm late.

942
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,450
Zheng Tianming, what's wrong with you?

943
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,560
We've played two rounds.

944
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:31,110
My mom stopped me and asked me to do an errand.

945
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,100
If you give me two more minutes,

946
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,340
I can guess that picture too.

947
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,450
Can you stop fooling around?

948
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,550
Let's play another round.

949
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,700
Xi, why didn't you tell us about this?

950
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,670
It's a significant matter.

951
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,660
A real friend will not hide this from us.

952
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,580
What is it?

953
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:43,260
Your dad has a tutoring class.

954
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,940
I'll definitely be the first one to sign up.

955
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,420
Where did you see it?

956
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,840
[Math Tutoring Class of Old Lin]

957
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,840
[Students wanted]

958
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,700
At the crossing nearby.

959
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,160
Mr Lin is handing out them by himself.

960
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,490
Math Tutoring Class of Old Lin?

961
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,180
Yes.

962
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,210
Xi.

963
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,220
Wait, she wants to quit?

964
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:56,940
She left.

965
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,340
Uncle Lin is

966
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,590
giving out leaflets, bearing all the hard weather.

967
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,220
How can we

968
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,020
play board games here?

969
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,220
Let's go and help.

970
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,150
Let's go.

971
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,940
Pei Zhi, aren't you going?

972
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,260
No.

973
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,460
Okay.

974
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,520
Dad, sister, you are back.

975
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,500
Yes.

976
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,760
Hold him.

977
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:39,580
It's okay.

978
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,860
How much did dad drink?

979
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,660
Not much.

980
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,620
Have you eaten?

981
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,230
I have.

982
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,140
One bottle, 500 grams.

983
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,730
1,000 ml.

984
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,780
500 grams of wine should be 500 ml.

985
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:52,610
I know.

986
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:53,950
It's 484 grams.

987
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:54,610
Drink some water.

988
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,300
Why did you drink wine if you can't drink too much?

989
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:58,570
I'm happy.

990
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,580
I'll be a teacher.

991
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,630
I'm the principal of a school.

992
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:04,620
From now on,

993
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,660
I'll make the school bigger and stronger.

994
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,620
I'll give you two

995
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,710
happy life,

996
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:10,290
and make sure you can spend everyday happily.

997
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,820
Don't worry about the debt.

998
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:12,480
I'll solve it myself.

999
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,540
It's not about the debt.

1000
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,820
I'm just happy.

1001
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:16,880
You can focus on singing.

1002
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,180
You two just need to study hard.

1003
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,220
Leave the rest to me.

1004
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,320
Leave it to me.

1005
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:30,800
Sister.

1006
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,020
What is the debt

1007
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,070
you said to dad?

1008
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,500
In order to save me,

1009
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,720
he owes Pei Zhi five million yuan.

1010
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:38,860
Five million?

1011
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,170
Why is he so cruel?

1012
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,810
It's not because of money.

1013
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,940
He's targeting me.

1014
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,940
Turn off the light.

1015
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,320
I'm going back to my room too.

1016
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,370
Wait a minute.

1017
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:54,940
Here.

1018
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,290
Where did you get it?

1019
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,710
I found it in an electronic city.

1020
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,460
Judging from the type, I think the owner of it

1021
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,180

But the tape can be used.

1023
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,330
Thank you.

1024
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:09,450
Why are you so polite

1025
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,070
to me?

1026
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:10,770
Go back.

1027
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,450
Rest early.

[Koperasi Loeong Zhuan Chu]

1029
00:38:59,070 --> 00:38:59,870
This video

1030
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,090
is only for Lin Zhaoxi.

1031
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,150
Those who are irrelevant, please leave.

1032
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:04,980
Otherwise,

1033
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,860
you'll have bad luck.

1034
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,710
Have you left?

1035
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:16,940
Yes?

1036
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,890
Then,

1037
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,690
I'll consider you are Lin Zhaoxi.

1038
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,490
Hello, Lin Zhaoxi,

1039
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,640
who is from Strawberry World.

1040
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,790
I'm Lin Zhaoxi from the Cheese World.

1041
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,780
I've been waiting for you.

1042
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,510
You didn't expect that, did you?

1043
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,720
After thinking about it,

1044
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:40,410
this is the only way

1045
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,490
to meet you.

1046
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,840
Maybe you don't want to see me either.

1047
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,060
Actually, I've been

1048
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,170
hiding in your closet.

1049
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:49,240
I'm looking at you now.

1050
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:53,090
I'm looking at you.

1051
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,450
You really opened that wardrobe?

1052
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:03,020
If you did,

1053
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,140
I'll laugh at you.

1054
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,160
Even if I'm locked in this body,

1055
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,730
I can laugh my heads off.

1056
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,880
Locked in this body?

1057
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,320
Aren't you smart?

1058
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,040
You even opened that wardrobe.

1059
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:24,710
Alright, I'm not kidding.

1060
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:30,660
Do you still remember

1061
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,120
that the first time you jumped,

1062
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,140
you traveled to 2006?

1063
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,750
I felt

1064
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,650
it was like

1065
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,360
I was locked in a space,

1066
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,750
watching a movie

1067
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,260
for several months.

1068
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:48,580
I was too young,

1069
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,240
and I don't remember the details.

1070
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,040
I could see

1071
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,610
everything you did.

1072
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,620
But I don't quite understand.

1073
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,420
I only know

1074
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,540
you're also Lin Zhaoxi.

1075
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,010
Lin Zhaoxi from another world.

1076
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,190
So,

1077
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,720
you can hear me talking now?

1078
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,010
I should say thank you.

1079
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:28,640
Thank you

1080
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,210
for helping me find my dad,

1081
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,410
and making Hua Juan my younger brother.

1082
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:37,260
Oh yes.

1083
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:40,400
And you made me

1084
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,420
getting the Math Olympiad medal,

1085
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,550
it enabled me to go to the best middle school.

1086
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:48,300
But you know what?

1087
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:51,950
I also hate you.

1088
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:56,230
I hate you so much.

1089
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,270
Because I'm always inferior to you.

1090
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,420
I'm not as good as you, not as hard-working as you.

1091
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:06,260
No matter what I become,

1092
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,380
people will say the same thing.

1093
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,820
Lin Zhaoxi, you're getting worse.

1094
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,670
You're getting more and more stupid.

1095
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,440
This is who I am now.

1096
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,050
But they don't know

1097
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,090
you cheated.

1098
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:17,860
You're an adult who bullied a child, aren't you?

1099
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,290
I'm a real child.

1100
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,040
No one knows

1101
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,140
that you bullied me.

1102
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,670
The thing I can never forgive

1103
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:28,350
is that

1104
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,940
you took Pei Zhi away from me.

1105
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:43,220
Before you left,

1106
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:45,580
you told Pei Zhi

1107
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,380
to take good care of me, right?

1108
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:48,770
Yes, he did.

1109
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:50,090
He have took good care of me.

1110
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,300
He cared about me.

1111
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:53,700
But do you know,

1112
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:54,700
every time he looks at me,

1113
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,780
I think

1114
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,420
he is thinking about you.

1115
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,750
He has been waiting for you.
