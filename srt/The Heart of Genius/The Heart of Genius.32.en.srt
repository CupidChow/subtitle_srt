"Was mich nicht umbringt,

macht mich stärker."

347
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,080
is a quote from which of

the following German philosophers?

349
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,070
A, G. W. F. Hegel.

350

Don't...

356

Don't you think this question is unfair to me?

360
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,180
But my friend Pei Zhi

361
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,050
once studied in Germany.

362
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,510
Can I ask him for help?

363
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,580
Of course.

364
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,660
Lin Zhaoxi

365
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,290
needs help now.

366

Pei Zhi, please look at the screen.

367
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,480
Pei Zhi, all you have to do

368
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,020
is tell me what this German sentence means.

369
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,600
As I once said,

370
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,730
different experiences

371
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,390
will make us different.

372
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,839
I thought it was

a perfect plan,

374
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,960
but Lin Zhaoxi's asking for help

375
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:13,770
reminds me of

376
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:14,940
one thing I neglected.

377
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:16,329
Different choices

378

I lived in before,

381
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:22,880
I chose not to study in Germany.

382
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,770
So I never learned German.

383
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:25,819
Sorry.

Yes. I did it on purpose.

Okay, please look at the first question.

409

We've been pretty high-profile lately.

in an entertainment show.

It's your turn.

419
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,420
How many years have you

420
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,840
had Alzheimer's?

421

Five years.

422
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,890
I don't look that bad, do I?

423
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,590
Not bad.

424

You look pretty... pretty sober.

425

My condition is less stable.

426
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,300
Because my brain

427
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,660
is different,

428

All right, you just have to

430

brag about yourself, don't you?

431
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,480
You haven't changed much about that.

432

Aren't you the same?

433
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,070
Just apologize if you want to.

You're now beating about the bush and playing chess with me.

Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

I'm not here to apologize.

437
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,070
Then why are you here?

438
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,000
You've been hiding from me for twenty years.

439
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,800
Why are you here if you're not here to apologize?

440
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,500
Leave.

441
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,250

I am Lin Zhaosheng.

444
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,780
When did you know this?

445
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,820
After Qiu Yue passed away.

446
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,190
Then why didn't you come to me?

447
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,450
Even if I go to you, she can't come back to life.

448
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,170
You've tortured me for twenty years.

449
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,660
Can you bring her back to life?

450
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:45,930
You're the one who's been wrong for twenty years.

451
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,020
Well. I've been trying to forgive you

452
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:59,140
for the past twenty years,

453
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,350
but I couldn't let go of the matter.

454
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,330
I'm not a saint.

455
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,890
I care about many things.

456
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,800
So I kept myself from thinking about it.

457
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,040
And

458
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,440
I shed all my tears

459
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,140
before Xi was two years old.

460
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,980
I've never cried

461
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,740
in front of her.

462
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,240
I just want

463
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,260
my daughter

464
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,450
to think I'm strong.

465
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,860
But I'm just an ordinary person.

466
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:35,760
I don't feel well when I'm sick.

467
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,690
I will be sad when I encounter difficulties.

468
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:39,850
And I've been betrayed

469
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:40,830
by my best friend.

470
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:42,770
How about we switch？

471
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,300
Zhaosheng, I'm sorry.

472
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:56,540
I don't accept it.

473
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,380
You're right.

474
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,270
That's it for the rest of my life.

475
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:08,860
In the next life...

476
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,660
I don't want to know you in my next life.

477
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,220
It depends on fate.

478
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,120
Then get down on your knees and kowtow to me.

479
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,540
Stop. I'm just kidding.

480
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,060
I remember that it was you

481
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,530
who taught me how to play chess.

482
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,420
Yeah.

483
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,020
In the Renmin Park.

484
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,500
We were both

485
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,700
ten years old

486
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,480
in third grade.

487
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,920
Let's go on.

488
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,010
Just finish what we started.

489
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,230
Zhang Shuping...

490
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,690
What are you doing here?

491
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,410
I came to play chess with your father.

492
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,130
And I lost.

493
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,770
We're back, dad.

494
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,370
Okay.

495
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:42,580
Why are you lying here?

496
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,540
Do you have a headache?

497
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,360
No, my blood pressure is a little high.

498
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,080
So I'm resting.

499
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,150
Then you... lie down and take a break.

500
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,200
We ran into Zhang Shuping

501
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,300
when he was leaving just now.

502
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:07,780
Hello?

503
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,990
Did he talk to you?

504
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,870
He said nothing.

505
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,130
Then he just left.

506
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,730
Yes.

507
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,730
He came to apologize to me.

508
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,290
He admitted it?

509
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,090
So have you forgiven him?

510
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,300
No.

511
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,470
Okay, I'll call you back.

512
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,390

What's wrong?

854
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,950
Are you okay?

855
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,140
[How difficult is the Tisomorphic image problem]

856
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:50,540
[How easy is the Tisomorphic image problem]

857
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,670
You finished my dad's research?

858
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,360
Yes.

859
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,720
Really?

860
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:58,650
When did you finish it?

861
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,160
Last night.

862
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,650
I couldn't sleep

863
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,910
and read Master's paper, then...

864
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,670
I'll have my dad take a look.

865
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:05,860
Xi, wait.

866
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:06,880
Just let my dad

867
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,090
finish reading it first.

868
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:08,770
It's a study

869
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,920
he's been working on for over twenty years.

870
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,630
Good. Very good.

871
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,340
Come on. Keep your head down. Look at me.

872
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,330
Okay.

873
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:24,750
Very good. Come here.

874
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,120
Fix it.

875
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:35,440
Okay, let's continue.

876
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,380
OK. Very good.

877
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,270
Turn your head a little more.

878
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,470
Look at me. Okay.

879
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:49,940
Handsome. Good.

880
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:52,110
Look at me.

881
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,100
Yes. Okay.

882
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:57,430
You think the current Pei Zhi

883
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,200
is the Pei Zhi from the Cheese World? How is that possible?

884
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,300
This Pei Zhi

885
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,460
can't speak German at all.
