You stay here.

6
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:44,970
I'll take a look.

7
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,060
Let's start.

8
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:49,970
You first.

9
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,340
Stop.

Hongxing Elementary School and Experimental Elementary School

Those from Experimental Elementary School,

13
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,230
stand up and come with me.

14
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,270
I was wondering what you were going to do.

15
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,020
You even gathered your schoolmates.

Come with me.

25
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,840
Hi,

26
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,950
I'm a freshman at Hongxing Elementary School.

27
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,790
Sit down and learn how to draw.

28
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:35,930
Don't come out before the class is over.

29
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,100
Stop, stop.

30

Those from Hongxing Elementary School,

35
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,020
stand up!

36
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,900
Lu, hurry up. Let's go.

37
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:48,930
What are you doing?

38
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,520
Stop talking. Hurry up.

39
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,060
What are they playing?

40
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,490
Do you know Bash game?

41
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,560
No.

42
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,410
I don't know it either. Just watch it.

43
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,540
We can't lose our momentum.

44
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:13,900
What's wrong?

45
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,340
Do you want to give in?

46
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,260
Lu Zhihao,

47
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:17,620
do you remember

48
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,420
what you have asked of me?

49
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,500
Are you serious, Lu?

50
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,540
It occurred to me that

51
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,110
this was not exciting enough.

52
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,700
How about

53
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:37,770
changing the rules every round?

54
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,660
For example, after I take the pieces this round,

55
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,170
I will stipulate that your limit is four pieces.

56
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,820
But the winning conditions remain the same.

57
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,630
In the next round,

58
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,660
you can also change the rules

59
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:46,540
to limit me.

60
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:48,070
But it should be no more than five pieces.

61
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,280
Isn't it fair?

62
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,660
No.

63
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,510
In that case,

64
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,110
no matter which of us

65
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,090
gets to the winning point first,

66
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,900
he or she will be stopped in the next round.

67
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,420
That will be meaningless.

68
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,980
I didn't expect that you could think of this.

69
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:01,850
Do you think that

70
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,220
you are the cleverest in the world?

71
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,010
Whether you are clever or not depends on the result.

72
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,860
Why don't we add something more?

73
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,650
You have played the game where one is drumming while the others pass, right?

74
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,460
Liu Xu.

75
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,870
He won't listen to us or look at us.

76
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,710
After a song stops,

77
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,860
we will stop changing the rules.

78
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,250
Check the total number and find the winning point.

79
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,470
It remains essentially the same despite all apparent changes.

80
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,050
Got it.

81

228 pieces.

88

Under the current rule,

89
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:02,980
the latter one will definitely lose.

90
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,820
How can it be possible?

91
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,360
She really knows how to play it.

92
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,690
But why could it be so fast?

93
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,280
The top limit is four.

There are 225 pieces left.

95

Experimental Elementary School and Hongxing Elementary School are competing.

101

Pei Zhi and Zhang Liang are both there.

102
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:33,770
Really?

103
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,360
Can anyone in Hongxing Elementary School win Pei Zhi?

104
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,620
I don't know.

105

The top limit is five.

107
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,120
Pei, what does this mean?

108
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,020
Once you know the rules,

00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,500
all strategies

110
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,980
will become simple subtraction,

111

multiplication and division.

112
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,750
Check the total in each game

113
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,550
and make sure the multiples of the number of pieces after you add one more.

114
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,620
Then, leave the multiple to the opponent.

115
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,160

The top limit is three.

Adding a time limit to the game

120
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:32,460
is to find out whether

121
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,370
the players can avoid calculation errors

122
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,730

Players can never

00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,620
give the chance of winning to the opponent.

125

He has made a mistake.

126
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,710
It's your turn. What are you waiting for?

127
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,450
I have heard this song.

128
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,780
It should be over soon.

We win.

133
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,810
Why?

134
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,060
What are you doing?

135
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,220
I'm waiting for this song to end.

136
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,380
You broke the rules. You cheated.

137
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,340
I didn't.

138
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,020
How could you

139
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:09,700
have the energy to pay attention to the music

140
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,740
when you calculated rapidly?

141
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,500
Three.

142
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:12,620
Two.

143
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,300
One.

144
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,660
The rules can't be changed.

145
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,020
You lose.

146
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,060
We both know that

147
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,220
you have made a mistake.

148
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,180
You gave the victory to me.

149
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:30,640
No.

150
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,180
The truth is that I'm more calm,

151
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,620
more accurate, and faster than you,

152
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,180
and I can last longer,

153
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,980
so I can win.

154
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,580
Lin Zhaoxi really won.

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,659
There are 81 pieces left on the chessboard.

156
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,380
The rule is that the top limit is three.

157
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:47,920
It's Lin Zhaoxi's turn to take the pieces.

158
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,030
Lin Zhaoxi will win if she takes one piece.

159
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,150
It's because Zhang Liang made a mistake

160
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,100
last round,

161
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,159
he changed the situation into where the latter definitely wins.

162
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,110
So,

163
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,020
Lin Zhaoxi didn't need

164
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,970
to change anything

165
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:58,650
to win.

166
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:01,740
Zhang Liang, you made the rules.

167
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,140
The music performer is your man.

168
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,970
You lost this game.

169
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,260
It's impossible. You must have cheated.

170
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,500
You said that I cheated

171
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,380
because you subconsciously thought that

172
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,560
I was not qualified to be your opponent

173
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,320
and I couldn't defeat you.

174
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,700
So you're ill-affected.

175
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,060
You always think you are the smartest.

176
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,340
Your school is good.

177
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,010
Your family is rich.

178
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,020
And you have good grades.

179
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,220
So, you look down upon others.

180
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,510
But actually,

181
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,740
there are always

182
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,960
people who are smarter than you.

183
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,580
There will always be people

184
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,700
who are stronger than you.

185
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:36,450
Instead of looking for

186
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,929
a sense of superiority

187
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,370
in those whose talents or families

188
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,309
are inferior to you,

189
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:43,260
it is better to look at

190
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:44,330
those who are better than you.

191
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,470
Try to look up to them.

192
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,060
And pursue the countless geniuses

193
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,240
in human history.

194
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:52,930
That's the true happiness.

195
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,700
Let's go.

196
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,020
Sorry.

197
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,010
Lin Zhaoxi, you're awesome.

198
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,120
You're much better than you said.

199
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,220
This is the foundation

200
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,610
my dad laid for me before.

201
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:31,900
Stand up.

202
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,020
That kid...

203
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,440
I think you're quite smart.

204
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:36,780
Let's play it together.

205
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,020
Give me a number.

206
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,510
1203.

207
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:44,660
What is the top limit?

208
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:45,850
28.

209
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,380
Who will win if I take 14 pieces?

210
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,740
You.

211
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,720
Give me another number.

212
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,580
155678.

213
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,370
What is the top limit?

214
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,320
318.

215
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:57,610
Who will win if I take 6 pieces?

216
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,810
-Are they playing the same thing as you? -Shut up.

217
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,220
You.

218
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:05,990
One more time.

219
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,130
It's enough. I won't play anymore.

220
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,330
There are only two audiences. It's boring.

221
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,390
No. Mr. Lin and Pei,

222
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,060
you go on.

223
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,300
I'll knock on the table to entertain you.

224
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,310
Put it down.

225
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:14,980
Stop it.

226
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,370
You must be smarter than me

227
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,290
and slower than me.

228
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,170
Do you know why?

229
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,070
No.

230
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:20,620
Do you want to know the reason?

231
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,300
Yes.

232
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:21,860
Call me master.

233
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,300
Master.

234
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:23,900
Master.

235
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,510
Master.

236
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,470
It's none of your business.

237
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,850
Coach, I want to learn Maths.

238
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,660
Dad.

239
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,050
As long as you don't call me dad,

240
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,270
everything is OK. Let go of me.

241
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,540
Coach, please.

242
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,160
Stand up.

243
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,220
Let go of me.

244
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,820
Coach, please.

245
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,540
I am begging you.

246
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,760
I won't get up if you don't agree.

247
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,240
Coach, please.

248
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,040
I can teach you math,

249
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,630
but what I teach may be

250
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,800
beyond the books.

251
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:51,590
It requires a lot of your

252
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,260
time and energy.

253
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,410
Do you still want to learn with me?

254
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,020
Okay, tell me why you want to learn with me.

255
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,200
I just like it.

256
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:01,840
Accepted.

257
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:02,950
Just like him,

258
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,060
I like it very much.

259
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:04,980
The reason can't be accepted.

260
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,100
I don't accept the same reason.

261
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,610
Just tell me the truth.

262
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,150
I have to aim at you. I have to...

263
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,160
I have to teach you based on your situation.

264
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,550
I just want to enter

265
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,260
Zhang Shuping’s Olympic Mathematics Training Camp.

266
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,250
Zhang Shuping is back.

267
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,800
Master, you know him too?

268
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,780
I know a lot about him.

269
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,650
He was my classmate and he was defeated by me.

270
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,540
Really?

271
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,420
Then Zhang Shuping.

272
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,030
is our master's brother.

273
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,410
With our background,

274
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,480
we don't need to take the exam.

275
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:37,460
I won't learn anymore.

276
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,380
I advise you not to mention me.

277
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,310
If you mention me,

278
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,540
even if you get full marks, he won't accept you.

279
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,160
Why?

280
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:45,920
We are rivals in love.

281
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:46,980
He was defeated by me.

282
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,300
Does Zhang Shuping like my mom?

283
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,020
Who is your mom?

284
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,520
She is your wife.

285
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,470
Lin Zhaoxi,

286
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,190
are you my master's daughter?

287
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,270
Stop.

288
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,610
I know your logic now.

289
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:01,980
Lin Zhaoxi,

290
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,980
Let me tell you again.

291
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,900
I'm not your dad.

292
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,240
Can we talk about it first?

293
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,120
I

294
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,350
will teach you maths for free.

295
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,220
But you can't call me dad.

296
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,730
You can call me master or Lin.

297
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,670
Otherwise, my heart...

298
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:12,350
I can't stand it.

299
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,180
Fine.

300
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,580
But you have to promise me one thing.

301
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,350
One day in the future,

302
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,460
I'll take a photo.

303
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,610
I'll decide the time and place.

304
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,030
No matter where you are at that time,

305
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,220
or what happens to you,

306
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,860
you have to come to me to fulfill your promise.

307
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,100
Just a photo?

308
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,200
Yes.

309
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,620
Deal.

310
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:40,330
Come on.

311
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,080
I want it too.

312
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,050
Okay, class begins.

313
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,060
Stand up.

314
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:50,310
Hello.

315
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,580
Hello, everyone. Sit down.

316
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,370
Pei Zhi isn't here today again, right?

317
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,950
He didn't come.

318
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,100
Let's continue to learn

319
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,510
mid-game attack and defense tactics.

320
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,740
Let's look at

321
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,440
this chess board first.

322
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,680
Why are you wearing a cartoon T-shirt?

323
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,370
Do you like to watch cartoons?

324
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,570
No.

325
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,780
I look young in this.

326
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,220
How old are you?

327
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,460
People always say I'm mature.

328
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,540
That's a compliment.

329
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,940
Pei Zhi is really interesting.

330
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,420
Pei,

331
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,540
you haven't been to the Go class for days.

332
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,930
Is that okay?

333
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,420
I don't like Go.

334
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,130
Why?

335
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,740
Go suits you well.

336
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:42,980
You can fully demonstrate

337
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,820
your calculating power.

338
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,940
I prefer maths.

339
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,780
Then why did you learn Go?

340
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,780
My mom asked me to learn it.

341
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,050
My mom doesn't like

342
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,370
me studying math.

343
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,570
She wants me to cultivate

344
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:54,450
more hobbies.

345
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,070
She even signed me up for

346
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,490
the art class and the dance class.

347
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,560
They are too hard to learn. I can't master them.

348
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,120
Maths is easier.

349
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:02,550
Is there a mother who doesn't

350
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,210
want her son to study?

351
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,530
My mom said math is useless to learn too much.

352
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,240
It's enough to get a full mark in the exam.

353
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,540
There's no need to study too hard.

354
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:10,670
So,

355
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,460
I read books secretly.

356
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,710
Lin Zhaoxi, listen.

357
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,740
Is this human language?

358
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:17,840
And he's just a kid,

359
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,300
but he said this.

360
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,570
Go and study.

361
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,140
You...

362
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,750
You should study hard too.

363
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:27,870
Mom, I'm back.

364
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:28,750
You're back.

365
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,860
Are you hungry?

366
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,500
How was your Go class?

367
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,520
There are ribs today.

368
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,420
I'll get you some first.

369
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,700
No need.

370
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,150
I'll wait for my dad

371
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,050
to eat together.

372
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,060
Okay, go wash your hands.

373
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,150
I don't want to learn anymore.

374
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,220
Why should we do the test paper

375
00:14:59,330 --> 00:14:59,870
while he is

376
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,210
eating, drinking, enjoying

377
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,990
and reading story books there?

378
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:02,740
Why?

379
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,560
This is not a story book.

380
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,010
But it's quite interesting.

381
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,010
We have been doing paper for three days.

382
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,550
I feel a bit terrible too.

383
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,580
If I don't do the paper, how can you enter the training camp?

384
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,160
No, I just want to ask

385
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,000
whether there are

386
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,740
some more quality-oriented methods?

387
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,390
In the movies,

388
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,140
they all went to feel the nature

389
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,210
and realized the essence of learning.

390
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,800
Then they liberated their nature.

391
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:25,950
Suddenly, they were enlightened

392
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,900
and their grades improved greatly.

393
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:29,580
Let me tell you.

394
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,330
The things required to pass the exam are

395
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:30,960
only talents,

396
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,120
learning skills and a lot of exercises.

397
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,020
You two are not as talented

398
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:33,810
as Pei Zhi,

399
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,480
and you don't have time to do a lot of exercises.

400
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,120
So I can only

401
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:35,990
prepare some exercises for you based on

402
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,770
your specific situation.

403
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,320
to help you review every knowledge point.

404
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,340
It can be considered as a kind of technique.

405
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,810
You have wasted a lot of my time,

406
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,940
but you are not grateful.

407
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,060
Thank you.

408
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,340
I can't take it anymore. It is enough.

409
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:56,100
Get up.

410
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,180
I can't take it anymore.

411
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,540
I'm not lying.

412
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,130
You're an adult.

413
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,860
The exam is the day after tomorrow. Don't go rogue.

414
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,190
This is more tiring than being a trainee.

415
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,820
If you fail,

416
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,120
it's hard

417
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,410
to be a trainee in this world.

418
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,260
I will learn it now.

419
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,740
But I don't think I can do it.

420
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,410
Lin taught you

421
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,740
and you learned it fast, right?

422
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,060
No, I'm nervous.

423
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:22,700
I'm under a lot of pressure.

424
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,270
God,

425
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,110
please let me go.

426
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,390
Hua Juan,

427
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,060
in the Strawberry World,

428
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,150
you were a star.

429
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,780
You were rich and famous.

430
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:37,980
But

431
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,770
you accidentally became a child.

432
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,250
I am an ordinary person.

433
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,620
Even I can't accept

434
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,370
this psychological gap,

435
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,460
but you adapted to it very quickly.

436
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,190
I really admire you.

437
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,620
Besides,

438
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,180
if you hadn't been with me,

439
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,540
I would have been mad.

440
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,250
And I think you are excellent,

441
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,460
optimistic and carefree.

442
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,650
You have good taste.

443
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,220
Although you're terrible,

444
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,880
you're not terrible at studying.

445
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,810
What? How can I be terrible?

446
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:07,140
You hyped scandals with female stars.

447
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,140
Why did you get in my car?

448
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:09,900
Drive away.

449
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,579
Who are you?

450
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,240
Don't you know me?

451
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,250
Ji Jiang?

452
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,170
Can you drive the car now?

453
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,140
Are you two a couple?

454
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,960
What are you talking about?

455
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,119
Oh, no.

456
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:20,819
Why don't you adhere the reflective film

457
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,250
to your car?

458
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:22,890
Or I can go to

459
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,560
explain to them.

460
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:24,730
What can you explain?

461
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,000
Can you explain it clearly?

462
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,369
Be quiet!

463
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,750
Lu, the car is on Baihua Road.

464
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,800
I'll leave the rest to you.

465
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,060
I'm always the one who cleans up the mess for you.

466
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,050
I'm not your dad.

467
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:43,620
Didn't I tell you

468
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,150
not to go to the hotel?

469
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:45,780
Tell me

470
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,130
why you came to the hotel for the rehearsal.

471
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,160
You asked me to go to the hotel.

472
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,230
I was unsure

473
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,630
so I wanted to rehearse.

474
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,010
Can't we rehearse in the company?

475
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,640
I asked you, but you agreed.

476
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,750
And you're blaming me now.

477
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,170
Who else should I blame?

478
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,930
You explain it to others.

479
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,090
Forget it.

480
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,340
I'll think about what to do myself.

481
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,040
Or maybe we can just go with it.

482
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,420
I think you are good.

483
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:21,630
No, you...

484
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,020
Let me make it clear.

485
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,120
We're just colleagues.

486
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,790
Don't think about other things.

487
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:34,650
Did you hear that?

488
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,450
She wanted to take advantage of my popularity.

489
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,580
You saw it.

490
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,770
She was so cunning.

491
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,510
She invited the reporters.

492
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,930
-I figured it out now. -Stop it.

493
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,420
Read books.

494
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,430
Listen.

495
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,120
Her men were also hyping the scandal online.

496
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,570
I'm serious.

497
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:04,940
Lin,

498
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,120
I heard you picked up a daughter.

499
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,730
Who said that? That's not true.

500
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,690
The security guards, people in the mail room and support crews

501
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:13,910
all knew that.

502
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,630
A little girl cared about you

503
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,030
and called you dad behind you.

504
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,390
You are

505
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,430
lucky.

506
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,590
Unlike me,

507
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,900
I just want a sweet daughter,

508
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,680
but I don't have one.

509
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,370
She's really not my daughter.

510
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,100
You don't admit it.

511
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,910
Everyone made mistakes

512
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,010
when they were young.

513
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,310
I heard that

514
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,660
no one is taking care of the child now.

515
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,000
You have to be responsible.

516
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:38,900
No matter what I say, you don't believe me.

517
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,850
I'll go out for a walk.

518
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,460
Perform well in the exam later.

519
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,170
Mom, I can walk there by myself.

520
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:01,900
Don't...

521
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:02,370
You...

522
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,600
Take this.

523
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,150
It's delicious. Come on.

524
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:05,790
Drink it yourself.

525
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:06,300
Take a sip.

526
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:07,450
I'm leaving.

527
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:08,130
Liangliang.

528
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,670
It is good.

529
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,680
Let's go.

530
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,690
Lin said he wouldn't come.

531
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:20,970
I am not waiting for him.

532
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,020
Can't I just stand here for a while?

533
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,570
Look, it's Pei.

534
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,460
Pei's father is a traffic police officer.

535
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,020
I've never seen him.

536
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,170
But in the Strawberry World,

537
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,400
his father passed away

538
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:34,950
when he was in junior high.

539
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:36,920
Why?

540
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,300
I don't know.

541
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:39,790
Should I

542
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,900
remind Pei Zhi?

543
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,860
Although the parallel world has changed,

544
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,100
most of the trajectories

545
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,010
are the same.

546
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,340
What if the tragedy happens again?

547
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,330
What can we say?

548
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,220
We know nothing.

549
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,130
Are we going to remind his dad to be careful?

550
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:52,670
Just let it be.

551
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,870
What are you talking about?

552
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,760
Nothing. We're waiting for you.

553
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,310
Lin Zhaoxi, Pei Zhi.

554
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,170
I won't lose this time.

555
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:02,940
He is so arrogant.

556
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,340
He is hopeless.

557
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,630
Wait.

558
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,180
He only called you two,

559
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,260
but not me.

560
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,780
He is looking down on me.

561
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,110
Hey!

562
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,310
Listen carefully.

563
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,250
I'm Dang Aimin. My nickname is Hua Juan.

564
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,300
What are you waiting for?

565
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,100
Nothing.

566
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,620
Let's go inside.

567
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,100
Everybody,

568
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,600
each of you has a test paper

569
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,780
and two pieces of draft paper.

570
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,560
Those who have got the test paper,

571
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,500
please don't answer the questions.

572
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,900
You can only answer the questions when the bell rings.

573
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,360
Okay, the exam begins.

574
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,670
Hello, honey.

575
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,390
Has Pei Zhi entered the exam room?

576
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:09,780
Yes.

577
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:11,820
Come to the Youth Palace.

578
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,180
Why?

579
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:13,690
I,

580
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:14,720
I have to go to work later.

581
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,030
I'll tell you when you are here.

582
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:16,580
Hurry up.

583
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,870
I'm waiting for you

584
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,700
in front of the Go classroom.

585
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,350
Well...

586
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,160
Sir, I have finished it.

587
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:45,470
Have you finished it?

588
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,920
So soon?

589
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,230
Aren't you going to check it again?

590
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,060
I have checked it.

591
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:53,770
So soon?

592
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,870
Okay, you can hand in your paper now.

593
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,370
Are Pei Zhi and I

594
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:56,140
really so different?

595
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,540
That's impossible.

596
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,160
The rest of you continue to answer the questions.

597
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,560
Calm down. This is the last question.

598
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,860
Three boxes were totally the same.

599
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,020
There were two red balls

600
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:12,940
in the first box.

601
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,100
There were two blue balls

602
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,060
in the second box.

603
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,140
In the last box,

604
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,070
there was a blue ball

605
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,850
and a red ball.

606
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,710
Pick a box randomly

607
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,130
from the three boxes.

608
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,660
Take out a ball from it.

609
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:23,880
It was red.

610
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,030
What is the probability of

611
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,100
the remaining ball

612
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,760
being red?

613
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,270
Rule out the box of two blue balls.

614
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,240
There are only boxes of two red balls

615
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,100
and one red ball and one blue ball left.

616
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,500
So it's one-second.

617
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,530
The last question is so simple.

618
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,810
[Anping Youth Palace]

619
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,000
Sir,

620
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,910
driving a motorcycle without a helmet

621
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,220
is against the traffic law.

622
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,300
Well, yes, thank you.

623
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,710
Thank you.

624
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,400
Thank you.

625
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,500
Put it on.

626
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,660
Safety is the most important.

627
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,340
Okay.

628
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,150
Let the first ball be red.

629
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:16,880
It is incident A.

630
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,110
Let the second ball be red.

631
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:18,700
It is incident B.

632
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,290
Under the condition of A,

633
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:20,910
what is the probability of B?

634
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,590
The probability of A and B happen at the same time is

635
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,620
P (AB) equals one third.

636
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,660
P (A) equals one third of red and red.

637
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:28,510
Plus one third

638
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,580
and multiply zero blue and blue.

639
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:30,900
Plus one third

640
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,310
and multiply one-second red and blue.

641
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,370
It equals one-second.

642
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,050
So under the condition of A,

643
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,220
the probability of B is

644
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,180
P (AB) to P(A).

645
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,230
It is two thirds.

646
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,780
Sir, I'm done too.

647
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,340
Take a look.

648
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,430
Among the three boxes,

649
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,270
pick one box randomly.

650
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,500
-Take out one ball out of the box. -OK. You can go now.

651
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,440
Calm down. Take your time.

652
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:01,900
The probabilities of the box of two red balls

653
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,250
and one red ball and one blue ball

654
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,420
are not the same.

655
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,260
We can't simply assume that

656
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,240
it is one-second.

657
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,190
Solve the questions with the listing method.

658
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:11,210
When we take out balls from three boxes,

659
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,750
we have six possibilities.

660
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,440
There are three possibilities

661
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,380
when you take out a red ball.

662
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,480
There are two possibilities

663
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,270
when the other one is also a red ball.

664
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,820
So P equals two thirds.

665
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,950
Sir, I'm done.

666
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:43,980
Are the students coming out?

667
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,060
Why is there only one person?

668
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,820
Did she finish it in advance?

669
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,620
Why didn't our children come out?

670
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,130
Lin Zhaoxi.

671
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,660
You said that you weren't coming.

672
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:01,760
I was just passing by.

673
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,470
Take it.

674
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,010
Move your ass to that side.

675
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,980
Why are you so slow?

676
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,080
I came out half the time in advance. Was I slow?

677
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,910
Pei Zhi came out in half an hour.

678
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,810
I have to check it.

679
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,350
You are not confident.

680
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,770
No one will check it if he is confident.

681
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,460
Right, Pei Zhi?

682
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,010
I checked it twice.

683
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:32,890
Look.

684
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,730
It's only half an hour after he's checked it twice.

685
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,590
Master.

686
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,480
You're here too.

687
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,240
I was passing by.

688
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:49,940
By the way,

689
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,070
what's the answer to the last question?

690
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:51,960
Two thirds.

691
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,660
Two thirds.

692
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,010
Why did I get

693
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,200
one-second?

694
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:56,940
It is the question of three doors.

695
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:58,060
It is about the condition and the probability.

696
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,390
I also wrote two thirds.

697
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,310
Didn't you get

698
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,100
one-second?

699
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,700
I had a dream.

700
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,210
I dreamed that

701
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,660
in a world full of strawberries,

702
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,560
I have answered this question.

703
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,840
I only remembered that

704
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,870
the answer was two thirds.

705
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,820
I forgot the process.

706
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,540
It's been so many years and

707
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,610
you still remember the answer.

708
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,500
Impressive.

709
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,720
I'm no match for you two.

710
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,020
What do you mean by "so many years"?

711
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:24,620
Nothing.

712
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:26,780
Alright, stop sitting here.

713
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,460
Since you all did it well,

714
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,580
I'll go back.

715
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:30,680
Come down.

716
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,240
Well,

717
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,070
we agreed

718
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:36,650
to celebrate at your place after the exam.

719
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,340
Do what you want.

720
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,200
I can't take so many of you.

721
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:40,870
Take a taxi.

722
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,540
Give me the fare.

723
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,890
What?

724
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,750
I taught you for free

725
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:46,690
and I even have to pay you.

726
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,450
Will you give me money or not?

727
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,140
Get the invoice.

728
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:55,610
Got it.

729
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,140
Then let's compete.

730
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,880
Whoever arrives first wins.

731
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,440
Begin.

732
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:01,470
Let's go.

733
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:04,740
You kids are funny. You want to

734
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,180
have a competition...

735
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:14,020
Don't lower your head. Don't stop.

736
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,320
I look up and stop.

737
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,660
I pretend to look around.

738
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:18,300
I stand at the green light intersection.

739
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,500
What song are you singing?

740
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,340
I've never heard of it.

741
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,040
Of course.

742
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,720
That’s his song.

743
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,010
You can write songs!

744
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:27,770
I'm your friend, Jiangjiang.

745
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,470
I'm also known for being versatile.

746
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,270
I can sing, dance, play the instruments and act.

747
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,850
My epitaph is "so cool".

748
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,400
Awesome!

749
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,300
So cute.

750
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,090
What are you saying?

751
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,290
I've never heard of it.

752
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,540
Of course.

753
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,630
Just treat him as a street performer.

754
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:43,780
Of course.

755
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:48,380
Gosh, Lin.

756
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,110
Sir, drive faster.

757
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,080
Sir, drive faster.

758
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,140
Don't be overtaken by him.

759
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:54,120
Wait for us, Lin!

760
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:54,940
Sir, drive faster.

761
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,180
Lin!

762
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,770
Lin!

763
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,600
Hurry up!

764
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,670
Sir, drive faster.

765
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,660
Hurry up.

766
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,090
Sir, drive to the fastest.

767
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,480
You mean that

768
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,220
Pei Zhi skipped classes, right?

769
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,200
It's quite strange.

770
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,020
Why aren't you nervous?

771
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,700
I often skipped classes when I was a kid.

772
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,300
He probably went to the Internet cafe

773
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:19,920
to play games.

774
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,450
That's not a big deal.

775
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,520
It would be good if he went to an internet cafe.

776
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,370
I heard the kid from the Zhang family say that

777
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,580
he always

778
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:27,380
stayed with

779
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,150
pretty low types.

780
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:32,170
That's really a problem.

781
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,340
Yes.

782
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:34,940
Hello.

783
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:35,750
Ms. Gao.

784
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,440
Is this Pei Zhi's father?

785
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,000
Yes.

786
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,090
-Ms. Gao. -Hi.

787
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:39,830
Did Pei Zhi say that

788
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,260
he came to the Youth Palace every day?

789
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,030
Yes.

790
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,900
But I haven't seen him

791
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,080
these days.

792
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,740
See? We're faster.

793
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,900
Pei, we won!

794
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,020
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

795
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,050
Do you admit being defeated?

796
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:02,940
No.

797
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,910
If you don't accept it, let's go ahead with the match.

798
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,310
Okay, let's continue it in a few days.

799
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,210
OK.

800
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,540
I'm asking if you accept your failure.

801
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,360
No.

802
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,230
How do we celebrate it? What do you want to eat?

803
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:12,850
Hamburger or pizza?

804
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,350
Mom and dad.

805
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,430
Whether he learns maths

806
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,420
is your family's business.

807
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,060
You don't have to

808
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:26,820
argue with me here.

809
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:27,820
If it weren't for you,

810
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,340
could my son skip classes?

811
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,700
What is your intention?

812
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,730
Mom, it has nothing to do with my master.

813
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,570
You're almost sold

814
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,920
and you're still counting money for the seller.

815
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:36,590
What?

816
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,880
I just taught him maths.

817
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,380
And I didn't even charge tuition fees.

818
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,760
Why am I a liar?

819
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,700
What do you want since you don't want the tuition fees?

820
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,780
This reflects that you have ulterior motives more evidently.

821
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,580
It's even scarier.

822
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,950
Lin is not a bad guy.

823
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:47,740
Exactly.

824
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,940
You can't wrong my master.

825
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,240
Listen to the children.

826
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:51,850
Auntie,

827
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,940
although Lin smokes, drinks,

828
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,180
has long hair and swears,

829
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,660
and he beats people like a hooligan,

830
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,110
he's really a good man.

831
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:00,730
He even beat people!

832
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,590
When did I beat people?

833
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,500
Who did I beat?

834
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,430
The king of calculation, right?

835
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,140
Did he beat you?

836
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,090
No.

837
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,030
I didn't say you were a bad guy.

838
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,110
Shut up, okay?

839
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:07,820
I'm not a liar.

840
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,260
I'm not cheating...

841
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,110
This is not over.

842
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:12,180
Alright, stop arguing.

843
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,050
Hello,

844
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:16,140
I'm Pei Zhi's father,

845
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:16,830
Pei Donglai.

846
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,020
I'm Lin Zhaosheng.

847
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:21,170
Look, these

848
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:21,860
are all math books here.

849
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:22,870
I can tell

850
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,870
the children are learning

851
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,700
from this teacher.

852
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:25,870
There is a smart person here.

853
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:27,240
So the wrong one is

854
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,150
our son.

855
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,610
Pei Zhi, how could you tell lies

856
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,550
and skip classes?

857
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:35,130
Apologize now.

858
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,310
Mom, I'm sorry.

859
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,500
It is good to recognize his fault.

860
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,150
Let's go home.

861
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,260
Is that it?

862
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,660
Are you going to arrest him?

863
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,560
Pei Zhi is fine.

864
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:49,330
Let's go.

865
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,250
Look at him.

866
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,040
Mom, I don't want to learn Go anymore.

867
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,150
I want to learn maths from my master.

868
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,180
Look.

869
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,550
He was brainwashed by a liar.

870
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,600
How can you say that he is fine?

871
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:00,150
Why am I a liar?

872
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:00,910
Let me tell you.

873
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:01,780
It has nothing to do with me.

874
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:02,980
Your misunderstanding

875
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,270
has no effect on me either.

876
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,930
But Pei Zhi said that...

877
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,630
I'll prove it to you.

878
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,320
Sorry. Come on.

879
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:14,450
Look, this is "Math. Annalen",

880
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:16,140
September 1993.

881
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,150
[Math. Annalen]

882
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,530
It is easy to find it.

883
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,420
It is my thesis.

884
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,460
Lin Zhaosheng in China.

885
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,280
Come on, take a look.

886
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,900
This is my ID card.

887
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,010
Lin Zhaosheng.

888
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,380
Please compare it.

889
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,960
I graduated from

890
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,100
Department of Mathematics, Yongchuan University.

891
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:33,910
Then I was recommended to

892
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,310
Sanwei University to be a postgraduate student.

893
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,980
I've studied math for more than 20 years.

894
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,310
I'm not lying.

895
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,400
I went to college when I was 15.

896
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,540
Is it okay for me

897
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,560
to teach Olympic mathematics of elementary school?

898
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:46,770
Auntie,

899
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,050
do you know the monk who swept the ground

900
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,030
in The Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils?

901
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,990
My master wandered around

902
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,090
and hid in the city.

903
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,180
He doesn't seek fame and fortune. He only focuses on the research.

904
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,910
Guarding the gate is just an appearance.

905
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:05,410
Sorry.

906
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:07,700
I misunderstood you.

907
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,230
I'm not a liar.

908
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,100
When you grow up,

909
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,820
don't be engaged in mathematics research.

910
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:14,980
See?

911
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,500
Otherwise, you can only guard the gate for others.

912
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:19,790
Mom, I'm only in the fifth grade.

913
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,340
Auntie.

914
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,050
mathematicians are respected.

915
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,730
They work

916
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,480
in major schools.

917
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,500
Besides, many big companies

918
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,540
hire Doctor of Mathematics

919
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,380
with high salary.

920
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,560
Mathematicians have a bright future.

921
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,190
You take my master as an example.

922
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,110
That's not appropriate.

923
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,430
He is an exception.

924
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,070
Many big companies hire me.

925
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,060
I didn't want to go.

926
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,370
See?

927
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,740
He can only paralyze himself by bragging.

928
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:48,780
How pathetic！

929
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:49,620
Sister,

930
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,930
why are you so prejudiced?

931
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:51,940
You don't need to say more.

932
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,390
My son is good at math.

933
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,170
He doesn't need anyone to teach him.

934
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,720
I will never

935
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,630
let him come to the Youth Palace anymore

936
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,140
Go

937
00:33:58,610 --> 00:33:59,530
Go.

938
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:04,040
Alright.

939
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,130
Don't go.

940
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,199
It'll backfire.

941
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,949
Shall we celebrate?

942
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,420
Celebrate?

943
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:15,570
No.

944
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,980
No, I want to eat pizza.

945
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:17,850
Please.

946
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,100
A total of

947
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,380
1245 students

948
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,100
took the exam.

949
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:31,940
We will take the top 80.

950
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,199
The 80th is 75.

951
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,530
Three people were tied for first place.

952
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:35,770
They all got full marks.

953
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,179
Pei Zhi,

954
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,020
Zhang Liang

955
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:43,409
and Lin Zhaoxi.

956
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:45,940
Only these three full marks?

957
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,739
The last question is harder.

958
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:48,980
Several students got

959
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,860
95 points.

960
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,239
They were all wrong in the last question.

961
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:55,719
You have corrected the paper all day.

962
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,639
Thank you for your hard work.

963
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,200
Go back and have a good rest.

964
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,740
There are still difficult things to do.

965
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,480
Son,

966
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,290
I have found

967
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:18,450
a very interesting game lately.

968
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,540
Let me play with you.

969
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,390
What are you doing?

970
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,420
My mom is mad at me.

971
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,340
She doesn't want me to join

972
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,430
Olympic mathematics training camp.

973
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:28,660
I am calculating to see

974
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,540
how to make her give up the idea.

975
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:35,180
Son,

976
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,130
based on my previous experience,

977
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,900
it won't end well

978
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,370
if you go against your mother.

979
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,100
I don't want to go against her.

980
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,740
I just want to persuade her.

981
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,090
Are they different?

982
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,410
But trust me,

983
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,380
your dad is

984
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,530
definitely

985
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,470
on your side.

986
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,220
You have to help me.

987
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,010
You know my status

988
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:57,990
in our family.

989
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,410
It's not that I don't want to help you.

990
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,710
When have I ever won

991
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:02,630
when I argued with your mom these years?

992
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,230
How can I help you?

993
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:05,990
Don't worry.

994
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,440
I've written it down.

995
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,730
Just follow the lyrics.

996
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,790
You punk.

997
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,610
You counted your dad in.

998
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,100
What are you two discussing?

999
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,020
My son is testing my intelligence.

1000
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:37,990
Is it necessary

1001
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,030
to test your mind?

1002
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,260
What's wrong with me?

1003
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,160
Maybe you're not as good as me.

1004
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,700
Let me test you.

1005
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:46,790
I won't play.

1006
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,050
I'm smarter than you anyway.

1007
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,020
Your mom doesn't play by the rules.

1008
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:58,710
Mom,

1009
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,540
there's a river here.

1010
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:03,210
There are two islands in the river.

1011
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,030
Seven bridges connect

1012
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,250
two islands and two shores.

1013
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,230
Can you cross the seven bridges

1014
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,610
in one go

1015
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,340
without repeating and missing the bridges?

1016
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:14,250
Try it.

1017
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,060
Draw it by one line?

1018
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,360
Just like you can do it.

1019
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:33,250
How about this?

1020
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:39,780
You do it.

1021
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,600
I don't know how to draw it.

1022
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,310
Then why are you so proud?

1023
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,540
I know I can't draw.

1024
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,510
No one can draw it.

1025
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,270
If no one can draw it,

1026
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,620
what's the point of this question?

1027
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,410
This is a question of

1028
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,570
the 18th century.

1029
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,860
Mathematician, Oppa, he...

1030
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:55,870
It's Euler.

1031
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,390
Even the mathematician, Euler, couldn't draw it.

1032
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,630
He thought he couldn't make it.

1033
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,970
But in maths,

1034
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,310
we need solid evidence

1035
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,740
to prove possibility and impossibility.

1036
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,640
So the mathematician, Euler,

1037
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,620
submitted "Copernicus Seven Bridges"

1038
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,730
to St Petersburg University.

1039
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:16,880
"Konigsberg Seven Bridges".

1040
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,150
I can't stand it anymore,

1041
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,500
Honey.

1042
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,290
You know it?

1043
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,280
"Konigsberg Seven Bridges",

1044
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,940
I knew this couldn't be solved.

1045
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:27,870
I just wanted to hear

1046
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,100
what you're holding back.

1047
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,830
Don't look at me.

1048
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:35,630
I don't know what to do.

1049
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,220
Mom,

1050
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,860
was it amazing that Euler

1051
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,700
created

1052
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:43,940
a branch in the math world,

1053
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,790
Graph theory

1054
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,930
and geometric topology,

1055
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:49,360
from a daily issue?

1056
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,300
Yes.

1057
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:52,620
So?

1058
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,130
This is maths.

1059
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,980
You never know

1060
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,590
what kind of future

1061
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:59,800
is behind a problem.

1062
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,770
Just like when I go to the camp,

1063
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,220
we all don't know

1064
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:04,970
what will happen.

1065
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:06,170
But I guess

1066
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,650
this

1067
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,210
will become

1068
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,190
my beautiful memory.

1069
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:12,510
Can you just let me go?

1070
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,730
But I don't want you

1071
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,270
to study math all day long.

1072
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,420
Our teacher said

1073
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,000
besides studying,

1074
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,540
we also have many activities.

1075
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,270
We can meet many new friends.

1076
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,250
It's good to make more friends.

1077
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,130
The friendship at their age

1078
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:31,960
is the purest.

1079
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,160
Look at me and Yu.

1080
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,380
If we hadn't been friends

1081
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:35,540
since were young,

1082
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,840
how could we be so close?

1083
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:37,680
Your friendship comes

1084
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,840
from fighting.

1085
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,410
Pei Zhi can't be like you.

1086
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,500
No, this...

1087
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,710
He attend more activities

1088
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,820
and he will be more cheerful.

1089
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:45,980
That's good.

1090
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,230
You said you were worried about

1091
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,230
the Math research

1092
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,720
It's far from our son.

1093
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,800
You think he's a genius, right?

1094
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,450
What if he is Zhongyong?

1095
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:54,480
When

1096
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,400
his grades drop,

1097
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,690
you will be worried.

1098
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,130
There's nothing wrong with Zhongyong.

1099
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:01,670
It's not tiring to be an ordinary person.

1100
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:03,950
Others' parents

1101
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,140
want their children to be successful.

1102
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,250
Why are you so stubborn?

1103
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,980
It's just a training camp.

1104
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,070
Pei Zhi said

1105
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:09,820
that he wanted to go.

1106
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,950
Why can't you

1107
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:11,870
say yes?

1108
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,980
I can see that

1109
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,750
you two are in cahoots.

1110
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,770
I can't convince you.

1111
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,820
Mom, I'm on your side.

1112
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,310
You're the best to me in the world.

1113
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,190
My dad ranks second.

1114
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,700
You little traitor,

1115
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:32,260
I... I took your side first.

1116
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,260
Why am I the second?

1117
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,140
Dad,

1118
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,820
don't try to

1119
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,970
change my mom's status.

1120
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,820
Enough. Stop talking.

1121
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:40,340
You can go,

1122
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,050
but be careful.

1123
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,300
Listen to your teacher.

1124
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,890
My mom agreed.

1125
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:47,100
I can go to the camp.

1126
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:47,560
Son.

1127
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,320
Pei Donglai.

1128
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,380
We did it. We have taken the first step.

1129
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:02,670
Our fate has changed.

1130
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,270
This is a parallel world.

1131
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,280
Everything is possible.

1132
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:06,370
As long as we do it,

1133
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,870
we still have a chance.

1134
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,210
I kind of believe in the soul soothers now.

1135
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,390
I'm so tired.

1136
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,620
It's not convenient to get smaller.

1137
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:35,710
I didn't expect

1138
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,070
that the gathering point is the Youth Palace.

1139
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:38,590
I wonder if your dad has come to work.

1140
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,320
I need to go there.

1141
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,800
I'll go with you.

1142
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:43,890
No need.

1143
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:44,690
The car will be here soon.

1144
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,390
You occupy the seats.

1145
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,570
Hello, uncle.

1146
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,050
Is Lin here?

1147
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,060
Are you his daughter?

1148
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:05,900
Your dad is not here.

1149
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,540
He asked me to give you this.

1150
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:12,660
Thank you, uncle.

1151
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:13,710
You're welcome.

1152
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:21,880
Zhaosheng,

1153
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:23,860
what are you looking at?

1154
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,300
Nothing. I was just in a trance.

1155
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,070
No.

1156
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,140
You...

1157
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,550
Why do I feel that

1158
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,780
you're absent-minded today?

1159
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:33,570
No.

1160
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,380
I've been staring at you.

1161
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:35,830
You are beautiful.

1162
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:36,970
Go on.

1163
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:38,010
Then learn with me together.

1164
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,300
Come on.

1165
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,170
Come on.

1166
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:45,240
Is it like this?

1167
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,950
One, two, three.

1168
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:50,850
Two, two, three.

1169
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,680
Three, two, three.

1170
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,290
Four, two, three.

1171
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,460
Five, two, three.

1172
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,750
We look great together.

1173
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,540
Six, two, three.

1174
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,390
Seven, two, three.
