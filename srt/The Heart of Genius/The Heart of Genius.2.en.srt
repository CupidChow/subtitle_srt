4
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:38,900
Brush your teeth.

5
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,020
Or you'll be late.

6
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,020
Why do I have to go to school?

7
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:44,830
I'm an adult.

8
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,860
Why would I go to primary school?

9
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,360
Stop.

10
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,620
Louder!

11
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,030
Go shout on the street.

12
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,500
I'm an adult.

13
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:53,170
I'm from 2018.

14
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,220
I bet Mrs. Li

15
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,060
will lock you up for a few more days

16
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,640
or send you to a psychiatrist.

17
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,520
Pack your schoolbag.

18
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,900
What is this?

19
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,669
I think you really need to go to a psychiatrist.

20
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,220
It's your schoolbag.

21
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,980
This is so ugly.

22
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,300
Now is not the time

23
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,620
to pick and choose.

24
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,640
And this is not bad.

25
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:20,740
Look.

26
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,350
Gunara, the God of Darkness.

27
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,180
So cool.

28
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,810
What god?

29
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,220
Gunara, the God of Darkness.

30
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,560
Balala the Fairies.

31
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,780
Haven't you seen it?

32
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,920
Bakala Transformation.

33
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,710
I, Lin Zhaoxi,

34
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,590
would like to be treated like a lunatic,

35
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,329
and forced to take medicines and be shocked by electricity

36
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,670
rather than carry this.

37
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,540
I'll leave you to electricity.

38
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,200
I'll wait for you at the door.

39
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:49,600
Hurry up.

40
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,160
I'm not going to school.

41
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,030
Later,

42
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:56,940
let's go to my house.

43
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:57,950
Since everything happened

44
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,100
at the gate of my house,

45
00:02:59,260 --> 00:02:59,870
the way back

46
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,870
must be there.

47
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,380
Can we wait until lunch break?

48
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,040
If we go now, we'll miss school.

49
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,830
The consequences of pupils missing school are very serious.

50
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,670
When we arrive at my house,

51
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,670
we can go back.

52
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,350
What are you afraid of?

53
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,300
What if we can't go back?

54
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,160
There's no "what if". I have to go back.

55
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,420
Is the world yours?

56
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,250
Lin Zhaoxi.

57
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,130
You two...

58
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,320
Dang Aimin, what are you doing?

59
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,490
Hurry up. Class will begin soon.

60
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,420
Let's go.

61
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,290
Line up.

62
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,030
Watch your step.

63
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:23,980
Come on.

64
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,380
Keep up.

65
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,440
Hurry up.

66
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,990
Slow down. Let's go.

67
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:29,980
Is everyone here?

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,220
Yes.

69
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,770
Hurry up.

70
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,120
Goodbye, Aunt Li.

71
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,500
Take your time.

72
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,710
Jiaqi, Yuqing.

73
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,700
Did you listen to your teacher?

74
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,510
Yes.

75
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:40,390
What?

76
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:43,780
Are you coming or not?

77
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,730
Let's collect out thoughts.

78
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,860
When we go back to my house,

79
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,380
let's check that wall first.

80
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,270
If the formula

81
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,580
is on that wall,

82
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,600
we can go back by erasing it.

83
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,370
That makes sense.

84
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,140
Plan B:

85
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,980
if the formula is not there,

86
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,820
let's try ripping the photo.

87
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,000
Maybe something will change too.

88
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,300
That makes perfect sense.

89
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:19,950
If we can find nothing,

90
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,230
then we have to go to my dad.

91
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,250
I became an orphan.

92
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,330
This is very unusual.

93
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,230
Maybe he knows something.

94
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,340
What do you think?

95
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,380
That makes super sense.

96
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,380
Mr Ji,

97
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,400
can you give me

98
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,790
a constructive opinion?

99
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,060
It's up to you.

100
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,260
Stand up.

101
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,510
Hello, everyone.

102
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,159
Hello, Miss.

103
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:54,790
Please have a seat.

104
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:57,790
Let's turn to page 79

105
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,210
of the Chinese textbook.

106
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:03,790
Where is Lin Zhaoxi?

107
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:04,830
She's not here.

108
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,550
Not here.

109
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,020
Dang Aimin didn't come, either?

110
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,290
I don't know.

111
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,040
Hao Moshi,

112
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,130
you take the lead and others read after her.

113
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,700
Read the Chinese text.

114
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,610
I'm going out for a while.

115
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,250
It's a pity that lunar January is over.

116
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,080
Okay, I got it.

117
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,260
Thank you.

118
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:29,840
I've checked

119
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,030
in the dorm.

120
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,710
Their personal belongings are still there.

121
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,940
What did the school say?

122
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,270
The teacher said

123
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,700
they were not in school from the first class.

124
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,560
The guard also said

125
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,480
he didn't see any students going out during recess.

126
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,260
They didn't come back.

127
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,590
Where do you think

128
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,490
they might go?

129
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,390
I sent them

130
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,710
to the school gate this morning.

131
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,850
Why are they gone?

132
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,100
Miss Li, don't worry.

133
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,270
Maybe the two kids

134
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,360
went out to play.

135
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,330
No way.

136
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,820
Da Tou and Jiaozi

137
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,920
might do this.

138
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,430
Lin Zhaoxi is the most obedient child.

139
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,260
Hua Juan is also an honest kid.

140
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,020
They never skipped any class.

141
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,700
If anything happened to them,

142
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:07,950
what should we do?

143
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,740
Calm down.

144
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:09,850
Let's keep looking.

145
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:11,930
A few days ago,

146
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,620
an International Olympic Committee official

147
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,500
gave high praise to

148
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,100
the preparation

149
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,380
of Beijing Olympics.

150
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,370
According to the plan,

151
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,510
Beijing will build

152
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,500
15 new

153
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,250
sports stadiums

154
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,060
and renovate

155
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,860
11 existing stadiums.

156
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,220
And this official said

157
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,510
Judging from the current progress of the project...

158
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,570
Let's go up.

159
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,260
Let's go.

160
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,130
They will be put into testing

161
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,080
two years before the Olympic Games.

162
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,370
These stadiums

163
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,180
will become

164
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,020
excellent modern sports buildings.

165
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,180
There's nothing here.

166
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,900
The two formulas

167
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,070
were left on the wall

168
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,820
when my dad and I

169
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,659
were playing games.

170
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:48,850
Now I'm an orphan.

171
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,800
My dad didn't raise a child.

172
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,000
That's why

173
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:53,870
the two formulas are not here.

174
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,140
Go home.

175
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,570
What are you doing?

176
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,650
I'm not home.

177
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,230
Watch me!

178
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,150
I think we failed again.

179
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,660
We want to go home.

180
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,540
Why don't you let us go back?

181
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,860
Why are we forced to jump?

182
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,220
Don't say it.

183
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,970
Don't let others know.

184
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,110
dad.

185
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,110
Are you home?

186
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,670
Lower your voice.

187
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,420
Are you home?

188
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,620
It might not even be your home.

189
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,850
dad, I'm Lin Zhaoxi.

190
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,180
Lin Zhaoxi, calm down.

191
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,970
Open the door!

192
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,270
dad, are you home?

193
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,150
I'm Lin Zhaoxi.

194
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:38,740
Calm down.

195
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,539
Are you home?

196
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,380
Calm down.

197
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,419
What are you doing?

198
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,780
dad.

199
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,370
What about some spicy hot pot?

200
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,300
Sure.

201
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,220
dad. dad.

202
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,630
Who is this kid?

203
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,530
I don't know.

204
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:10,970
dad, I'm your daughter.

205
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,380
Are you calling me?

206
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,320
You have a daughter?

207
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,070
Don't tease me.

208
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,820
Do I look like I have a child?

209
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,960
-Dad. -Kid, I'm not your dad.

210
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,300
No, dad, I'm Lin Zhaoxi.

211
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:21,930
Look.

212
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,380
You said you don't have a daughter.

213
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,380
She has the same surname as you.

214
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:25,540
Liar.

215
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,400
Qian. Qian.

216
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,470
No, this is a misunderstanding.

217
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,830
dad, don't you recognize me?

218
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,090
I'm Lin Zhaoxi.

219
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,290
dad, I'm Lin Zhaoxi.

220
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:32,800
Let go!

221
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,530
You got the wrong person.

222
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,720
Qian. Qian.

223
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:36,870
Please let me explain.

224
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,860
Lin Zhaoxi.

225
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,900
Qian, Qian, I...

226
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,230
Shut up! Shut up!

227
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:40,870
Wait.

228
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,930
Let me ask her.

229
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,930
Let's figure it out, okay?

230
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:43,740
Baby, okay?

231
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,890
Figure it out.

232
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:48,180
What...

233
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,780
What's wrong with you?

234
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,140
Why do you call me dad?

235
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,260
Do you know it's dangerous?

236
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,940
What if you were abducted?

237
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:57,800
Besides, do you know me?

238
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,470
Why do you call me dad?

239
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,140
Your name is Lin Zhaosheng.

240
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,410
born in the Second People's Hospital

241
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,340
in 1973.

242
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,620
My grandpa is Lin Shixiang.

243
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,220
My grandma is Song Chunhua.

244
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,730
You studied in Changgeng primary school.

245
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,320
You were a student in No. 3 middle school.

246
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,290
No, baby...

247
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:20,940
Who are you?

248
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,690
I'm your daughter.

249
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,860
Not bad, Lin Zhaosheng.

250
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:26,990
In order to be with me,

251
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,420
you even abandoned your daughter.

252
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,020
No.

253
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,820
Trash.

254
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,520
No, no.

255
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,860
Qian, listen to me. Qian.

256
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,330
How about this?

257
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,260
Well...

258
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,140
No.

259
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:35,860
Give it to me.

260
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,780
Qian, I...

261
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,540
-Let go of me. -Qian, I love you.

262
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:39,450
Get lost!

263
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,230
Don't forget

264
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,620
what we are here for.

265
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,760
Now you live

266
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,040
in an orphanage.

267
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,710
It's normal that your dad doesn't know you.

268
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:46,690
Just ask him

269
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,230
whether he knows about the jump?

270
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:48,740
Listen.

271
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,530
If you come to me again,

272
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:50,160
I'll hit you.

273
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,660
I love you.

274
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,450
Qian, I love you.

275
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,570
Trash.

276
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,820
My goodness.

277
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,250
This is crazy.

278
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,720
Come on.

279
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,060
What's wrong with you two?

280
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,120
Let me talk to him.

281
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:11,780
We are

282
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:12,750
from Hongxing Welfare Home.

283
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:13,660
Listen.

284
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,820
I don't plan to adopt an orphan.

285
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,630
No, Uncle.

286
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,060
That's not what I meant.

287
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,050
Who are you calling uncle?

288
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,060
Am I that old?

289
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,770
Then, Bro...

290
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:20,840
Who are you calling bro?

291
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,420
Uncle...

292
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,140
You say it.

293
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,220
You.

294
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,620
You.

295
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,020
dad.

296
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,110
Maybe what I'm saying now

297
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,580
is hard to believe.

298
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:40,380
But I promise

299
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,790
I'm telling the truth.

300
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,660
I'm your daughter.

301
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:45,590
I don't know why

302
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,750
I was sent to the orphanage.

303
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,480
I grew up in an orphanage.

304
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,870
I have something urgent to tell you.

305
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,380
Fine.

306
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,580
You're an orphan.

307
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,820
You grew up in an orphanage.

308
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:56,710
How did you know

309
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,580
I'm your dad?

310
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,810
I'll start from the beginning.

311
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,420
We've always been father and daughter.

312
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,300
This year

313
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,100
in 2018,

314
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,310
I am 23.

315
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,070
This is our house.

316
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,620
We've been living here.

317
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,150
One day, you passed out.

318
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,190
I don't know what happened or

319
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:16,930
who did it.

320
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,360
You're still lying in the hospital.

321
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,420
I don't know when you'll wake up.

322
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,290
One day,

323
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,510
I met him on my way home.

324
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,090
Then

325
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,950
I saw a mysterious photo.

326
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:23,650
Then I erased

327
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:24,140
the formula we wrote

328
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,400
on the wall a few years ago.

329
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,870
A squared plus b squared

330
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,850
equals c squared.

331
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,390
Then there was thunder in the sky.

332
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,740
I went back to 2006

333
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:31,700
and became an orphan.

334
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:32,530
You still live here.

335
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:33,420
Do you know

336
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,260
what happened?

337
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,180
I got it.

338
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,420
Are you crazy?

339
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,370
Such a poor child.

340
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,480
So young, and an orphan.

341
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:44,900
Enough.

342
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,870
I'll let it slide.

343
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,500
Go play.

344
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,120
No, dad.

345
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,820
I may not have made myself clear.

346
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,150
Listen to me again.

347
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,060
Don't bother me.

348
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,190
If you keep bothering me, I'm telling you,

349
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,140
I'll contact the orphanage.

350
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,350
No, no, no. We're leaving now.

351
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:54,940
We're leaving now.

352
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,560
We're leaving now.

353
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,900
dad, I'm really your daughter.

354
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,240
Let's go.

355
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:08,890
dad.

356
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,660
Stop it.

357
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,520
Trust me. I'm Lin Zhaoxi.

358
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,380
dad, I'm really your daughter.

359
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:19,990
Now your dad thinks

360
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,260
you're crazy.

361
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:21,790
No matter what you say,

362
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,540
he'll never believe you.

363
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,180
That's not my dad.

364
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,380
He just looks like him.

365
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,540
My dad doesn't know how to ride a motorcycle,

366
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,560
nor would he dress like that.

367
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,060
Don't be angry.

368
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,390
You said when we arrive at your house

369
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,420
we can go back.

370
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,520
There's no need to write one, two, three.

371
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,390
You're right.

372
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,120
Does the result work?

373
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,470
Does it?

374
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,220
At least I tried.

375
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,030
Unlike you, who doesn't do anything.

376
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,130
You're just sarcastic.

377
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,790
Who said I didn't do anything?

378
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,210
I want to go back too.

379
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,020
I'm a national idol.

380
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:52,990
If I can't go back,

381
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,860
my female fans

382
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,960
must be so sad.

383
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,290
Tell me, what did you do?

384
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,450
Yesterday, I tried

385
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,910
every way I could think of.

386
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,380
穿梭时空

387
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,020
Time travel.

388
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,690
Time travel.

389
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,250
Are those your ideas?

390
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,710
What a genius.

391
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,020
I'm an actor,

392
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,010
not a physicist,

393
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,030
or Doraemon.

394
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,740
What can I think of?

395
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,450
Besides,

396
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,290
we are at the same level.

397
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,580
Write formula, rip photos,

398
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,840
and make a big noise to the sky.

399
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,370
How dare you laugh about me?

400
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,990
Where are you going, Lin Zhaoxi?

401
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:37,970
The school is over there.

402
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,210
Go to primary school by yourself.

403
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,860
I'll find another way.

404
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:43,980
If we don't go back,

405
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,380
the director will call the police.

406
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,170
I don't care.

407
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,460
If we can't go back,

408
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,840
we have to start over here

409
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,950
and live on.

410
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:51,910
If we want to live well,

411
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,330
we can't go against the director.

412
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,980
Otherwise, we will have a hard time.

413
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,470
My dad

414
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,550
is still lying in the hospital.

415
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,020
I don't know when he can get up.

416
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,100
But somehow,

417
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:00,620
I went back

418
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,550
to the past.

419
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:01,980
And you're here talking about

420
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,300
living a life here.

421
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,020
We have to be prepared for the worst.

422
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,380
What's wrong with your dad?

423
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,340
Is he sick?

424
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,420
It's none of your business.

425
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,970
Can I at least ask?

426
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,540
Your dishes are all here.

427
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:26,970
Thank you.

428
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:33,630
I ordered

429
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,270
your favorite dishes.

430
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,070
Come on, let's eat.

431
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,980
Five teachers, Auntie,

432
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,850
and me,

433
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,710
we went around

434
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,840
around Hongxing Elementary School,

435
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,220
but we couldn't find you.

436
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,370
How many calls have I made?

437
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,930
I've called the hospitals

438
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,710
and traffic police.

439
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:05,140
They all said

440
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,220
there was no

441
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,360
car accident today.

442
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,020
Then I'm relieved.

443
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,140
Mrs. Li,

444
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,160
why don't you ask

445
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,990
where we went?

446
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,620
You are good kids.

447
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,020
Especially you, Lin Zhaoxi.

448
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,880
You always

449
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,880
more independent than other kids.

450
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:31,910
So I know

451
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,060
you didn't cause trouble

452
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,400
on purpose.

453
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:36,560
Eat.

454
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,740
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

455
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,010
What did you do wrong?

456
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,340
I shouldn't skip class and made you worry.

457
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:56,980
I didn't cherish

458
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,570
the hard-earned learning opportunity.

459
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,180
I'm sorry to myself.

460
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:08,890
Alright.

461
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,380
Go back to class after lunch.

462
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,540
I need to go to the bathroom.

463
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,680
I thought

464
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,900
we shouldn't be here

465
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,859
nor be responsible for anyone.

466
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:28,990
But just now,

467
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,340
seeing Mrs. Li looking at me like that,

468
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,840
why am I so upset?

469
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,210
It's a trap.

470
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,050
This is Mrs. Li's unique skill.

471
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,740
It's like when two people are in a relationship,

472
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,700
when the girl is unhappy,

473
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,180
she will not scold the boy.

474
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:42,940
She just ask him,

475
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,750
do you know what you did wrong?

476
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,340
The boy would think...

477
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,560
Did I

478
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,050
speak to her in a loud voice?

479
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:51,780
No.

480
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,590
Did I

481
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,860
hesitate when I paying for her clothes?

482
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,450
No.

483
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,570
You cooked last night,

484
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,790
but I didn't wash the dishes.

485
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,660
Still no.

486
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,290
The less the girl says,

487
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,820
the more scared the boy is,

488
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,130
His liver would tremble.

489
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,840
In the end, he could only kneel

490
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,820
and beg for forgiveness.

491
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,060
But I'm still confused.

492
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,310
What did I do wrong?

493
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,520
I did something wrong but I didn't get scolded.

494
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,530
That's why you feel guilty.

495
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,740
You know it well.

496
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,300
Of course.

497
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,790
Psychology battle. It's a man's compulsory course.

498
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,820
We need it to deal with girls.

499
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,550
As the saying goes,

500
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,770
know yourself and know enemy, and you will win every battle.

501
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,020
Scum.

502
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,300
We're getting off the topic.

503
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,460
Judging from the situation,

504
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,250
we have to go to school.

505
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,190
Elementary school?

506
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,620
I studied hard for 16 years.

507
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,110
Now I returned to the beginning in one night.

508
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,400
There is a golden full moon

509
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:05,820
in the deep blue sky.

510
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:10,110
Below is the sand of the seashore,

511
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:13,930
on which

512
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,500
endless turquoise watermelons are planted.

513
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,000
There was

514
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,020
a 12-year-old boy

515
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:21,750
Lin Zhaoxi.

516

00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,520
Stand up and carry on.

519
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:33,550
There was

520
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,860
a 12-year-old boy

521
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:35,710
Go on.

522
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,350
wearing a silver necklace.

523
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,100
He holds...

524
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,360
What is he holding?

525
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,340
Run Tu.

526
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,020
Run Tu?

527
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,700
Hold a piece of Run Tu, right?

528
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:51,940
Stand at the back.

529
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,860
Lu Zhihao, what are you laughing at?

530
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,860
Stand with her.

531
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,070
Come on, let's carry on.

532
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:04,830
He holds a fork in his hand.

533
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:09,220
He tried his best to stab at a badger.

534
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,210
Class,

535
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,790
you have two days this weekend.

536
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,240
Play less and read more.

537
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,580
Alright, class is over.

538
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,310
Stand up.

539
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,870
Goodbye, Miss.

540
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,540
Goodbye, students.

541
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:23,850
Class is over.

542
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:24,950
Class is over.

543
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,780
It's my bad luck to sit behind you.

544
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,420
I can't take it anymore.

545
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,550
I can't take it anymore.

546
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,230
I'm going crazy.

547
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,350
It's only been one afternoon.

548
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,160
If we can't go back,

549
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,590
we still have a year after summer vacation.

550
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,300
Students study for six years in primary school,

551
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,110
three years in middle school, three years in high school,

552
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:56,370
and four years...

553
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,400
we'll feel much better when we get to college.

554
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,160
I can't do it again.

555
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,320
Just bear with it.

556
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,540
Everyone has been through this.

557
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,050
No one has done it twice.

558
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,990
Can you really be patient enough

559
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,020
to do it again

560
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:12,940
with these kids?

561
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:13,780
What else can we do?

562
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:15,820
Skip class again?

563
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,760
Or should we just

564
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,000
just leave the orphanage?

565
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,080
The director might think

566
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,290
we eloped for love.

567
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,440
You want to elope?

568
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,040
You heard it wrong.

569
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,860
You two are dating.

570
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,520
You want to skip class and elope?

571
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,630
I'll tell my mom.

572
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,080
No.

573
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,490
Why do you want to tell your mom?

574

His mother is our head teacher.

575
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,470
Bro, I believe in you.

576
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,720
You wouldn't do such a thing.

578
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:41,900
What?

579
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,310
If you buy me a CD,

580
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,320
then I won't tell my mom.

581
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,160
Did I hear it right?

582
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,410
Is he blackmailing me?

583
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,850
He's funnier than you.

584
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,250
What's funnier is

585
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,660
he is my future agent.

586
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,700
He is reliable.

587
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,350
When you grow up,

588
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,540
you two

589
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,340
are a perfect match.

590
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,780
What are you talking about?

591
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:03,780
If you don't buy the CD,

592
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,360
I'll go to my mom's office.

593
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,800
Sure.

594
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,300
We'll be so close in the future.

595

Just like brothers.

the new album of Fang Wensan.

598
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,060
No problem.

00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,120
Wait.

600
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,580

Isn't it Yu Qian?

From now on, I will focus on

acting and crosstalk.

He won the award for best actor in a leading role.

00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,380
I know

why I'm in the orphanage.

What do you know?

Why don't I understand?

630

Have you heard that

every choice someone makes

632
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:15,320
will lead to

a different world.

00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,440
What do you mean?

635
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,010
Look.

636
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:22,960
For example,

637
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:23,700
we want to buy a cake.

638
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,750
And

639
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,660
one of them is in strawberry flavor,

640
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,860
the other is a cheese cake.

641
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,430
Every choice will

00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,620
trigger a different development.

In the past,

we live in a world where we chose the strawberry flavor.

But now,

646
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,420
the world tastes like cheese.

647
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,150
What does the cake flavor

648
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:40,070
has nothing to do with

649
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:40,700

I'm just making an analogy.

Anyway,

changed his mind,

so I became an orphan.

657

Whether it's the strawberry flavor

658
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,460
or cheese flavor,

659
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,390
the two worlds

660
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,390
are similar,

but not exactly the same.

00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,430
This is a photo of the cheese world.

690
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,180
Then why did it appear

691
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,200
in the Strawberry World?

692
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:00,860
I don't know.

693
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,100
Then why did it

694
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,240
come to

695
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:03,940
the cheese world.

696
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,220
I can be sure that

697
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,350
it not only

698
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,770
brought us to the cheese world,

699
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,910
but also brought us

700
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,940
to an earlier time.

701
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,920
Of course.

702
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:12,870
Zhang Shuping's camp

703
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,860
hasn't started yet.

704
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,460
This photo

705
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,950
belongs to the future of the cheese world.

706
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,150
So?

707
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,140
What does that mean?

708
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,260
This is a possibility in the future.

709
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,500
If

710
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,840
we die in an accident in two days?

711
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,540
What do you mean?

712
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,240
I mean if...

713
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,660
If, if, if...

714
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,700
Or we didn't

715
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:33,590
qualify for

716
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,170
Zhang Shuping's Olympic mathematics training camp.

717
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,080
This photo

718
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,500
will not appear.

719
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:39,010
Right.

720
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,630
On the contrary,

721
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,490
we work harder

722
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,700
to do something

723
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,410
and make this photo

724
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,380
the reality.

725
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,110
Then this photo

726
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:50,800
will appear a few months later.

727
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,280
I might return to the strawberry world

728
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,720
and go back to my front door.

729
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,430
Go back?

730
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,640
Maybe

731
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:58,940
we can...

732
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:00,600
If this photo is back,

733
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,100
maybe we'll be back too.

734
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,500
That's right.

735
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,060
How sure are you?

736
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,430
Not sure at all.

737
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,410
What do you think?

738
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:09,950
Same as you. Not sure at all.

739
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,240
Let's do it.

740
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,650
OK.

741
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,430
What should we do?

742
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,340
First,

743
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,860
we have to qualify for

744
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,480
Zhang Shuping's Olympic mathematics training camp.

745
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,020
Yes.

746
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,190
If I successfully

747
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,370
got into the training camp,

748
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,680
everyone in the photo

749
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,780
will also appear.

750
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,750
Except him.

751
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,750
So cute and pretty.

752
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:41,660
As long as you're happy.

753
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:42,740
Today,

754
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,180
many volunteers came.

755
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,360
Families

756
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,910
who want to adopt children will come too.

757
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,380
You must behave yourselves.

758
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,030
I don't want to be adopted.

759
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,410
Don't be silly.

760
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:53,820
Can you stay here

761
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,620
for the rest of your life?

762
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,520
Miss Li,

763
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,670
Jiao Zi's nose is bleeding again.

764
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:58,770
Please go and have a look.

765
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,940
Okay, I'll be right there.

766
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:00,860
Don't run around.

767
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:02,280
I'll come back for you later.

768
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:11,980
Take it.

769
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:12,890
Thank you, brother.

770
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,130
Be careful.

771
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,680
Twist it.

772
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,300
Childish.

773
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,070
I've been waiting for you.

774
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:44,940
You're too slow.

775
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,260
You wore a hairpin

776
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,460
and a skirt.

777
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,420
So cute.

778
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,740
Have you had breakfast?

779
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,220
Not yet.

780
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,330
Here.

781
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,090
Childish.

782
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,350
You're welcome.

783
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,080
Let me tell you.

784
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,200
Don't talk about parallel world with your dad.

785
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,290
He won't believe it.

786
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,470
Okay, I'll listen to you. It's a secret.

787
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:18,770
Lin Zhaoxi,

788
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,190
why is the door open?

789
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,720
Let's go to my house.

790
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:24,690
Let's go.

791
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:48,850
Ji Jiang.

792
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:50,740
What's wrong?

793
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,260
The key.

794
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,510
No.

795
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:56,750
Your dad is not home.

796
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,010
We shouldn't go in.

797
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,860
Why not?

798
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,020
I want to see

799
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,210
how my dad

800
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,150
is living in a parallel world?

801
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,220
Kids, you...

802
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,600
Auntie Song?

803
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,330
You are?

804
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,100
I am

805
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,500
Lin Zhaosheng's niece.

806
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,040
I'm here to visit my uncle.

807
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,660
I saw you a few times when I was young.

808
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,400
Lin's niece?

809
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,960
I remember her.

810
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,500
My uncle gave me the key.

811
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,560
He said he would be back late.

812
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,160
but he didn't tell me where he went.

813
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,870
Do you know where he went?

814
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,790
I'm not sure.

815
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:35,310
I think she went to work.

816
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,190
Do you know

817
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,160
where he works?

818
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,300
He seems to work

819
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,700
at the Youth Palace.

820
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,960
Your uncle always changes his job.

821
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,320
I am not sure if he still works there.

822
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,110
Thank you.

823
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:49,850
You're welcome.

824
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,000
Remember to close the door.

825
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,380
Gosh, your dad's math professor

826
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,760
in the strawberry world.

827
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,460
He's an accountant of Experimental High School.

828
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,290
Accounting is very difficult.

829
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,940
It seems that he's still obsessed

830
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:29,810
in math.

831
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,660
My dad is a mathematician,

832
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:34,880
but a non-mainstream one.

833
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,850
This is more like the room

834
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,300
of a man in his thirties.

835
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,190
From the living room,

836
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,230
it looks like it belongs to

837
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,180
a respectable academician in his 70s?

838
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:54,980
What should we do now?

839
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,730
We can't just wait here.

840
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:58,660
When your dad comes back,

841
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,820
he might think we are thieves.

842
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:02,010
Let's go.

843
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:02,820
Where are we going?

844
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,080
The Youth Palace. Find him.

845
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,160
Is there a teacher

846
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,180
called Lin Zhaosheng?

847
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,700
We don't have him here.

848
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,330
Kid.

849
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,440
Thank you.

850
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,240
Hello.

851
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:18,770
Is there a teacher

852
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,870
called Lin Zhaosheng?

853
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,290
Lin Zhaosheng?

854
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,060
Never heard of him.

855
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:25,670
Thank you.

856
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,360
Little girl,

857
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:30,490
we don't have

858
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,670
Mr. Lin here.

859
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:33,780
Thank you.

860
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:34,500
You're welcome.

861
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:44,220
There are several Youth Palaces in our city

862
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,500
Did we

863
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,790
came to the wrong one?

864
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,950
Your dad may not be a math teacher.

865
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,560
If he works here,

866
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,810
what else can he do if he doesn't teach math?

867
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,340
Accountant of the Youth Palace?

868
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,500
He may teach music

869
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:58,110
or something else.

870
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,950
Look at his outfit. He's so rocky.

871
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,220
But he's out of tune even when he sings.

872
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,050
Let along rock.

873
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,190
What should we do now?

874
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,580
Go back to Zhuanxhu Alley

875
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,380
and wait for him.

876
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,100
That's the only way.

877
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,440
Are we really going back?

878
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,620
Recently,

879
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,260
a parent of a student

880
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,180
came back to thank me.

881
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,600
Is it Lu?

882
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,610
He said he bought my book

883
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,840
to show it to his son.

884
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:23,170
Lu Zhihao, why are you here?

885
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,300
Why are you two here?

886
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,510
Did the orphanage have money

887
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,820
to sign you up for the cram school?

888
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,220
Has he always been so annoying?

889
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,750
He was naive when he was young.

890
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:32,990
Don't take it to heart.

891
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,080
You said it like

892
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,270
you are adults.

893
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,410
Why? Why?

894
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,880
He wants to buy out my book,

895
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,490
to buy out my idea.

896
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:41,860
He will give me some money.

897
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:43,300
If I take it,

898
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,970
I can't sell my calculation method any more.

899
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,840
In this way,

900
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,340
his kids will have no competitors in the future.

901
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,940
什么 太坏了

902
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,880
What kind of person is he?

903
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,350
He's too selfish.

904
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,620
He's so mean and selfish.

905
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,580
How could he do that? He's so selfish.

906
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,900
He doesn't want other kids to study this method.

907
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,260
Of course I didn't take the money.

908
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,780
I honestly told him

909
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,760
I invented this calculation method

910
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,680
to benefit more students.

911
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,930
Money is not important to me.

912
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,410
I'm too rich.

913
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,140
Ask my assistant.

914
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:09,800
My assistant knows

915
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,700
which city I live in and

916
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,530
whether I have a car or a house.

917
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,500
I'm very rich.

918
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,180
Enough.

919
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,710
Stop showing off here.

920
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,520
I sincerely

921
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,380
want more children

922
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,620
to learn math well.

923
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,660
So I set

924
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:22,800
a very low price.

925
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,310
100 yuan.

926
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,570
100 yuan for a book.

927
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,740
100 yuan? That's too expensive.

928
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,660
Parents, think about it.

929
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,810
100 yuan,

930
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,280
just buy less snacks for your kid,

931
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,780
or don't go out for a party.

932
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,750
That's how you can save 100 yuan.

933
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,780
With mere 100 yuan,

934
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,820
you can let

935
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,510
your child's math

936
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,390
have a great improvement.

937
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,220
Is it worth it?

938
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,380
Yes.

939
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,240
Come on.

940
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,270
Come on.

941
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,130
I'll buy you one.

942
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,100
Are you buying it?

943
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:48,660
Leave me alone.

944
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,460
If you don't buy it now, it'll be too late.

945
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,890
Can the calculation book really work?

946
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:52,930
No way.

947
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,990
Since Mr. Zhang wants to benefit the students,

948
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,460
why don't you give them books for free?

949
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,780
That's right.

950
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:00,290
Yes.

951
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,540
Everyone.

952
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,820
Parents and students,

953
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,330
you all know one thing.

954
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,810
Tao cannot be passed down easily.

955
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,449
Knowledge is power.

956
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:11,120
There is no free lunch in the world.

957
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,560
If you get

958
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,320
a very cheap thing,

959
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:14,260
will you cherish it?

960
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:15,070
You won't.

961
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,100
The Tao you're talking about

962
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,230
is the knowledge of Arthur Benjamin

963
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:20,659
and the power of Michael Shermer.

964
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:24,230
Who?

965
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,100
Why? You don't even know

966
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,469
the authors

967
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:29,380
of this pirated book.

968
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,340
I've read this book.

969
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:36,590
This book was written by

970
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,860
the two foreigners I just mentioned.

971
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,230
It's sold in Xinhua Bookstore.

972
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,030
If I remember correctly,

973
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,760
it should only be 17.5 yuan.

974
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:45,429
17.5 yuan?

975
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,230
It systematically summarizes

976
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,420
various mental arithmetic methods.

977
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,389
You can check out in the bookstore.

978
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,420
He could be a liar.

979
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,280
Parents,

980
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:52,949
this girl said that

981
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:54,260
this is a pirated book.

982
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,100
Parents, children's words carry no harm.

983
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,750
Let me tell you the truth.

984
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,740
Miss,

985
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,690
I've never heard of

986
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,100
the names of the two foreigners.

987
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:03,670
I don't know them either.

988
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,010
You're just making up stories.

989
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,630
If you can say that

990
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,340
a book is pirated

991
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:10,900
by just mentioning two foreign names.

992
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:11,930
In this case,

993
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,010
all the parents here

994
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:13,710
can say

995
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:14,440
two foreign names

996
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,670
to deny my book?

997
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,020
Yes.

998
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,580
Okay, you said you read this book.

999
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,700
Let me ask you.

1000
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,970
What is the third power of 13?

1001
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:24,780
Answer me now.

1002
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,820
He thinks I'm young.

1003
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,180
He thinks I can't remember

1004
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:28,950
even if I read it.

1005
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:30,870
Unfortunately, my memory is not bad.

1006
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:31,840
No, no, no.

1007
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:32,700
Can you answer me?

1008
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,570
Answer me.

1009
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,310
The third power of thirteen equals

1010
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:36,710
bracket thirteen minus three

1011
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,050
inverse bracket multiplied by thirteen

1012
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,100
times bracket thirteen

1013
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,210
plus three inverse bracket

1014
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,480
plus three times three times thirteen

1015
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,290
that is, 2,197.

1016
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:44,870
Young lady,

1017
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,900
you have a good memory.

1018
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,860
When you opened the book,

1019
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,370
you remembered this question.

1020
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:51,820
I remember now.

1021
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,270
You bought my book.

1022
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,100
Do you remember

1023
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:54,950
you and your mom...

1024
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,910
You were not this tall.

1025
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,940
When you were this tall,

1026
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,580
You're so cunning, little girl.

1027
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:00,590
Your book is so expensive.

1028
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,560
We can't afford it.

1029
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,030
Let me tell you.

1030
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,280
Calculating is not reciting texts.

1031
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,320
As you know,

1032
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:06,330
in the end,

1033
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,950
we have to use it in reality.

1034
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:09,560
Yes.

1035
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,460
Well, little girl.

1036
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,560
There are so many parents here.

1037
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,480
We can ask anyone here

1038
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,350
to give us a question.

1039
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,220
Let's answer it.

1040
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:15,750
Let's see who answers faster and accurate.

1041
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,020
Do you dare to compete?

1042
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:18,620
Yes.

1043
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,080
Good idea.

1044
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,140
Sir,

1045
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,490
give me a question.

1046
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,300
Me?

1047
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,340
Fine.

1048
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,820
I'll just say it casually.

1049
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,910
You can't do it casually.

1050
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,500
You have to make it complicated.

1051
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,020
This is high IQ against high IQ.

1052
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,430
OK, I'll give you a difficult one.

1053
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,590
What is

1054
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:38,050
92,960,675

1055
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:38,960
divided by

1056
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:39,750
78?

1057
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,780
This is too hard.

1058
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:42,920
Oh no, Lin Zhaoxi.

1059
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,950
Can you figure it out?

1060
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,150
You shouldn't have showed off.

1061
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:46,890
Quiet!

1062
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:47,860
Quiet!

1063
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:49,300
Little girl,

1064
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,060
do you want me to tell you the answer?

1065
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,230
1,191,803.525641

1066
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:03,830
This genius

1067
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,020
is amazing.

1068
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,230
Pei Zhi.

1069
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:51,900
Whose child is this?

1070
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:52,970
Who let her out?

1071
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,310
We are discussing math.

1072
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,610
Why are you interrupting?

1073
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,780
Go, go, go. Play elsewhere.

1074
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,780
You already made a question.

1075
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,750
To be fair,

1076
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,830
I'll make the next question.

1077
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,460
You'll answer.

1078
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,850
Don't make it. I won't answer either.

1079
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,300
How is it unfair?

1080
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,400
Everyone can see it.

1081
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,380
A question by a third party

1082
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:11,380
is the fairest, right?

1083
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,310
He's your partner.

1084
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,580
Nonsense.

1085
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,370
Why is he talking nonsense again?

1086
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,250
I don't know him.

1087
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:21,660
Who are you?

1088
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,320
Are you here to ruin my reputation?

1089
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:24,860
Here's my question.

1090
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,450
1,234.

1091
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,620
What question?

1092
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,960
Do you think your answer

1093
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:29,660
is correct?

1094
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,540
It can't be wrong.

1095
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,230
Did you use a computer?

1096
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,500
Or are you colluding?

1097
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,460
It's a simple question. No need for that.

1098
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,280
Do you want me to

1099
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,500
ask a parent

1100
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,420
to give you another question?

1101
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,640
-Sure. -That makes sense.

1102
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,470
Another question?

1103
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,180
No problem.

1104
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,120
Are you crazy?

1105
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,140
Why swear?

1106
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,350
Whose child is this?

1107
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:47,900
Where are your parents?

1108
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,890
Are you an orphan?

1109
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,090
I'll teach you a lesson

1110
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,270
on behalf of your parents.

1111
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:04,980
I'll fix you.

1112
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:06,750
Stop!

1113
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:08,950
Stop!

1114
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,980
Hua Juan, let's go.

1115
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:11,900
Teach you a lesson

1116
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,960
on behalf of your parents.

1117
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:14,860
Stop!

1118
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,520
Brat!

1119
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,020
Stop!

1120
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,430
Stop!

1121
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:23,720
Brat!

1122
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:24,980
Brat!

1123
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:29,780
Do you want to die?

1124
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,050
Why are you here again?

1125
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,030
Lin, I said that

1126
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,180
I'll beat you up every time I see you.

1127
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,160
You liar. Again?

1128
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,890
It's none of your business.

1129
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:37,790
-It is my business. This is my territory. -Dad.

1130
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,490
It has nothing to do with me.

1131
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:39,100
Let them out.

1132
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,100
-I'll teach them a lesson -Dad.

1133
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:45,070
She's your daughter?

1134
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,630
Forget it.

1135
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,380
Leave now!

1136
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,000
Does your whole family

1137
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:48,770
bully people?

1138
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:49,710
Who am I bullying?

1139
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,320
You liar.

1140
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:50,900
Did you forget about

1141
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,740
last time?

1142
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:52,260
Let's go.

1143
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:53,980
Yes, the Youth Palace is your place.

1144
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,080
Come out.

1145
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:55,750
So what?

1146
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,160
-So what? -The Youth Palace is your place.

1147
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:57,650
Come out.

1148
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,220
I'm telling you.

1149
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:58,900
I'll beat you up every time I see you.

1150
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,060
Hurry up, or we'll call the police.

1151
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,620
Wait here.

1152
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:04,620
Let's go.

1153
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,890
Kid, wait for me.

1154
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,180
Remember this.

1155
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,520
And you.

1156
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,980
You talk too much. Leave now.

1157
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:12,690
Lin Zhaoxi.

1158
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,460
Your dad is not a teacher.

1159
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,440
Your dad is a martial artist.

1160
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,520
Why is it you again?

1161
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:33,730
Stop following me.

1162
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:35,920
Pei.

1163
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:37,190
Long time no see.

1164
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,340
You're still so cool.

1165
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:39,120
You're a good friend.

1166
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,400
Unlike Lu Zhihao.

1167
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,100
He's long gone.

1168
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:43,310
Do we know each other?

1169
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:47,950
We

1170
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,390
share weal and woe together.

1171
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:49,900
Right?

1172
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:50,910
Let's get to know each other again.

1173
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,040
My name is Ji.

1174
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:55,020
No. My name is Dang Aimin.

1175
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:56,550
Yes, Dang Aimin, and my nickname is Hua Juan,

1176
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,840
from Hongxing Welfare Home.

1177
00:40:58,570 --> 00:40:59,220
Pei Zhi.

1178
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,710
Hello, Pei Zhi.

1179
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,240
Hi, Hua Juan.

1180
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:04,930
Hey, you...

1181
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,240
what are you doing?

1182
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,010
Someday,

1183
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,500
I'll take a photo.

1184
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,980
But I'll let you know in advance.

1185
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,790
Can you guarantee that you'll come at any time?

1186
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:14,430
I can't.

1187
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,700
Why should I take photos with you?

1188
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,030
Because you're my dad.

1189
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:17,850
There you go again.

1190
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:18,970
Hey, kid.

1191
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:19,970
My name is Lin Zhaoxi.

1192
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,870
Lin Zhaoxi,

1193
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,810
what do you want from me?

1194
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:23,700
Alimony?

1195
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,540
I want you to send me back.

1196
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:26,500
That's easy.

1197
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,230
You want me to send you back to the Welfare Home?

1198
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,270
I'll call a taxi for you. Let's go.

1199
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,540
Wait.

1200
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,380
Why am I an orphan?

1201
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,610
You abandoned me.

1202
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:35,520
You want a home?

1203
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,550
I can understand

1204
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,580
your feeling.

1205
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,870
I feel the same.

1206
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,590
I'm touched.

1207
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,900
But, I'm not your father.

1208
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:42,050
You are!

1209
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:45,690
Do you have evidence?

1210
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:48,670
You can't say that we're family

1211
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,540
just because we have the same surname.

1212
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,620
I had a long dream.

1213
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,310
I dreamed that we were father and daughter.

1214
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,160
So I know everything about you.

1215
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,380
A dream? The evidence is so convincing.

1216
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:06,380
Then ask me.

1217
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:09,370
Look at you.

1218
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,640
Fine, let me ask you.

1219
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,040
What's my favorite food?

1220
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:15,690
Chicken.

1221
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:17,770
Yes, you investigated me.

1222
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:18,600
You know

1223
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,230
my parents' name.

1224
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,060
Which part of the chicken?

1225
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,080
Chicken wing tips.

1226
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:25,860
No.

1227
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:28,770
I like the middle part.

1228
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,200
There's no meat on the tip of the wings.

1229
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,430
What games do I like?

1230
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,220
Math.

1231
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,180
Is math a game?

1232
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:33,910
Chess?

1233
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,610
Do you think I'm a grandpa in the park?

1234
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,040
Let me tell you the truth.

1235
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:38,390
I like

1236
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,020
cars, billiards,

1237
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,290
clubbing,

1238
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,270
and hiking.

1239
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,940
No, how is that possible?

1240
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,150
Growing up,

1241
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,140
you've never been to

1242
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:46,900
Shanghai or Guangzhou.

1243
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:47,660
Growing up?

1244
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,170
Do you know me?

1245
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,100
Let me tell you.

1246
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:51,270
Not only have I been to Shanghai,

1247
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:51,940
I've also worked there

1248
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,010
for two years.

1249
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,940
I'll talk to you

1250
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,930
in the Shanghai dialect.

1251
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:58,900
See?

1252
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,200
I'm not good at speaking the Shanghai dialect.

1253
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,090
Perfect, just perfect.
