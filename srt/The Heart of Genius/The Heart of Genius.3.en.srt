Does this mean that we are destined for each other?

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,170
"Dong" can be found in the word "Dongfeng (means the east wind)".

175
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,180
And "Xi" is from the name "Lin Zhaoxi".

176
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,620
Well, Lin Dongxi.

177
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,580
Have you finished your homework?

178
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,260
No.

179
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,500
I'll write it now.

180
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,340
Call me Lin Dongxi.

181
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,380
Lin Dongxi?

182
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,250
Xi.

183
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:32,780
Lin Dongxi.

184
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:33,500
Let me introduce someone to you.

185
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,020
What?

186
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,830
Where is he? Come in.

187
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:38,700
This is Pei Zhi.

188
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,770
You're in the same grade.

189
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,530
You must have met before.

190
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:41,810
We get along very well.

191
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:42,650
In the future,

192
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,850
he will come to our house every weekend.

193
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:45,659
I'll teach him math.

194
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,409
Come in.

195
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:47,810
Hello.

196
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,909
The probability

197
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,340
has been doubled really.

198
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,070
Hello.

199
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:56,890
I remember you.

200
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,200
We were in the same junior high school, right?

201
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,100
Also in the same primary school.

202
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,660
But we were not in the same class.

203
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,200
I remember

204
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,180
your name is Lin Zhaoxi?

205
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,730
No. My name...

206
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,020
My nickname is Lin Dong...

207
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,950
My nickname is Lin Dongxi.

208
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,620
I'll take you in.

209
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,970
V means a non-empty and finite set.

210
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,700
It's called a vertex set.

211
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,300
Dad.

212
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,460
Dad.

213
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:22,870
Dad. Dad.

214
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,530
I want to listen to your class.

215
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,300
You can't understand it.

216
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,670
Why can't I understand it?

217
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,190
Since I was a kid,

218
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:28,990
you have never taught me.

219
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,020
And I'm already a senior high school student.

220
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,860
I can understand it.

221
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,669
You don't like to hear me nagging, do you?

222
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,610
I'm willing to do it now.

223
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,000
Teach me.

224
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,270
I've got my book.

225
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,570
OK. Sit here and listen.

226
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,220
Listen carefully.

227
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:43,520
ϕ is the ordered or unordered pair of vertices

228
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,650
in elements of E to V

229
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,640
multiplied by the function of vertices.

230
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,590
It's called the incidence function.

231
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,240
E is an multiple finite set

232
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,980
of the unordered set V.

233
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,370
What? Go ahead.

234
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,100
A set

235
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,270
in which elements can be repeated

236
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,060
is called an edge set.

237
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,750
Its elements are called undirected edges

238
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,680
or edges for short.

239
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,220
Do you know the graph partition?

240
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,620
I have known a little.

241
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,310
The graph partition means

242
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,740
that if a simple n-level graph

243
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,240
and the degree of each vertex is di,

244
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,420
the integer k

245
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,180
is the partition ∑di of n parts.

246
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,280
This is called the graph partition.

247
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,380
What's wrong?

248
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,840
Are you unhappy because the handsome guy left?

249
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,390
It's okay. He'll come next week.

250
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,200
I don't understand what you taught.

251
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,380
It's normal.

252
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,630
This is not what you should know

253
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,220
at your age.

254
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,080
But Pei Zhi understood it.

255
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,930
He's different. He's a genius.

256
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,780
Are you not convinced?

257
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,470
If you're not convinced, I'll teach you from the beginning.

258
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,310
So there were so many things happened

259
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,220
between you and Pei Zhi

260
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,400
in the Strawberry World.

261
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,420
I haven't been to this room for years.

262
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,140
I really miss it.

263
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,730
I was alone at that time.

264
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,390
I remember the first time I found this place

265
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,840
was because I didn't know the ways

266
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:34,610
in the welfare home.

267
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,930
It seems that Da Tou found me.

268
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,860
After that,

269
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,900
it became our secret base.

270
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,380
How does the light go out?

271
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,820
Lin Zhaoxi, are you still there?

272
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,060
Lin Zhaoxi?

273
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,590
I'm not here.

274
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,380
Don't be scared.

275
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,460
You're the one who's scared.

276
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,420
Why should I be scared?

277
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:00,250
Darn it.

278
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,570
Who is it?

279
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,640
It's me, Da Tou.

280
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,570
Da Tou?

281
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,290
How do you know

282
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,240
that I'm at the secret base.

283
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,300
Why don't you turn on the light?

284
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,900
Don't mention it. The bulb broken.

285
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,510
There's a low voltage box.

286
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,310
It has a lighter,

287
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:17,620
candles and candies inside.

288
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:18,780
Those things are all yours.

289
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,660
Thank you, Da Tou.

290
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,370
I didn't expect you to be so kind.

291
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,830
I'm here

292
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,540
to thank you

293
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,380
for running out today.

294
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,690
Among my friends,

295
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,500
you two are the most qualified.

296
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,740
If you were here,

297
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:32,990
Jiao Zi wouldn't be adopted.

298
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:33,860
What do you mean?

299
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,920
Jiao Zi has been adopted.

300
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,910
He is going to enjoy his life with his parents.

301
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,410
Jiao Zi has been adopted?

302
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,270
Yes.

303
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,250
Both of his parents are college professors.

304
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,430
They are well-off

305
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,450
and well educated.

306
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,090
They also said

307
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:46,750
that they would take Jiao Zi  to see the doctor.

308
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,750
Really?

309
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,430
Cheese Jiao Zi

310
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,980
is luckier than Strawberry Jiao Zi.

311
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,700
Strawberry? Why is the strawberry?

312
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,640
Nothing. I was just kidding.

313
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,070
Among my brothers,

314
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,390
I care about Jiao Zi the most.

315
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,590
Now Jiao Zi

316
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,860
is enjoying his life with his parents.

317
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,460
I have nothing to worry about.

318
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:03,720
I'm leaving.

319
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:04,680
Wait.

320
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,570
Do you know the surname

321
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:10,410
of the professor who adopted Jiao Zi?

322
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,260
It's Ji.

323
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,310
What's wrong?

324
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:18,720
Nothing.

325
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:24,100
Three, two, one. Cheese.

326
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,370
I'm really a pig.

327
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,440
I'm a pig.

328
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,760
It was my fault. It was my fault.

329
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,780
I shouldn't have dragged you out.

330
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,030
Otherwise, your parents

331
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:41,900
would still choose you.

332
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,670
It's no use

333
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,120
saying this now.

334
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,120
Don't... Don;t cry.

335
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,360
My... My dad

336
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,590
also abandoned me.

337
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,300
Actually, it's good.

338
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,230
In the Strawberry World,

339
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,740
my dad has always been disappointed in me.

340
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,010
Here,

341
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,320
my dad doesn't have to worry about it.

342
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,960
Why was he disappointed in you?

343
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,020
Maybe because I was timid.

344
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,110
I think you're brave.

345
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,020
You were not afraid

346
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:40,920
to expose the liar's lies directly.

347
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,550
Maybe because

348
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,690
I'm in the parallel world now.

349
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,220
I didn't care too much anymore.

350
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,500
I just wanted to go back.

351
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,310
Now I feel scared.

352
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,110
Anyway, I think you're awesome.

353
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,670
In the Strawberry World, I'm just a coward

354
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,370
who don't dare to solve math problems.

355
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,060
Why?

356
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,720
Because I'm stupid.

357
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,570
You are stupid?

358
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,060
Don't I look stupid?

359
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:06,980
When I was young,

360
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,310
I didn’t even get into

361
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,220
Zhang Shuping’s training camp.

362
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,340
Not to mention my ability in specialized math.

363
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,490
Dad.

364
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:20,250
You're back.

365
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,700
I failed to get into the camp.

366
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,230
Don't be upset.

367
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,150
It's just a summer camp

368
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,350
Go in.

369
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,290
I'll cook for you later.

370
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:31,580
Hurry up.

371
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,680
My dad didn't say anything that day.

372
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,300
He even comforted me.

373
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,820
But from his eyes,

374
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,570
I could see that he was more depressed than me.

375
00:14:59,260 --> 00:14:59,940
Pei Zhi and I

376
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,820
have been in the same school since the elementary school.

377
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,800
Compared with him and my dad,

378
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:04,910
I know very well

379
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,250
that I'm just an ordinary person.

380
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,240
Thank you, master.

381
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,780
When Pei Zhi was in senior high school,

382
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,730
he met my dad.

383
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,940
Maybe it was because

384
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,940
geniuses were attracted to each other.

385
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:26,900
They soon became close friends

386
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,220
beyond the relationship between teacher and student.

387
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,930
He was more like

388
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,860
my dad's child than me.

389
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,280
I heard Pei Zhi went abroad later.

390
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,380
He went to Germany.

391
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,650
He didn't leave a word before he left.

392
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,500
My dad was depressed

393
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,400
for a while.

394
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,980
Didn't you try to find him?

395
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,730
I did.

396
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,070
I didn't find him.

397
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,820
Actually...

398
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,930
Actually, I like math.

399
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,180
Maybe it's because of the influence of my dad.

400
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:12,950
But I'm

401
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,840
not gifted.

402
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,140
I don't know why.

403
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,170
If someone like me studies math,

404
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,900
the possibility of his success

405
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,940
may only be one percent.

406
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,320
So what?

407
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,300
It's still better than zero.

408
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,390
And I really think

409
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,300
you are very smart.

410
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:29,240
It's not like

411
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,190
what you said.

412
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,730
Although I don't know math well,

413
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,850
I don't think

414
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,150
it is right

415
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,540
that the higher your IQ is, the more successful you will be.

416
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,750
Otherwise, we can just gather

417
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,470
and compare our IQ.

418
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,660
Doing research will be useless.

419
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,610
IQ is the threshold.

420
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,200
You can reach the threshold definitely.

421
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,160
Don't define yourself

422
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,270
so early.

423
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,340
Distance tests the strength of a horse.

424
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,300
You have to be far-sighted.

425
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,069
But I can't think about

426
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:12,140
long-term matters.

427
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:14,579
I just want to go home now.

428
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,220
I only want to go home.

429
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,500
My dad is still in hospital

430
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,190
and is unconscious.

431
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,260
I have to go back.

432
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,349
Now is the time

433
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,540
he needs me the most.

434
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,980
What happened to your dad?

435
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:28,430
He was robbed

436
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,300
and was hit in the head.

437
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,010
Was the culprit caught?

438
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:34,740
No.

439
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,070
So,

440
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,000
you can understand my feeling, right?

441
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,100
I have to go back.

442
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,090
And I can't

443
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,020
be weak

444
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:48,830
like before.

445
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,970
I have to pull myself together.

446
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,260
Got it.

447
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,040
I used to think

448
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,300
that I could live a new life

449
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,780
in the new world.

450
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,800
Now, I don't even have my parents.

451
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,060
I have no leeway.

452
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,750
I have to go back.

453
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,340
Never give up.

454
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,110
Never give up.

455
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,530
Pinky swear.

456
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,590
Let's do our best

457
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,450
to go home together.

458
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,730
Do our best to go home together.

459
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,030
Get up.

460
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,960
Why are you here again?

461
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,730
Mrs. Li is looking for you.

462
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,020
Hurry up.

463
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,360
Go to the director's office.

464
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,620
Someone is going to adopt you.

465
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,410
Stop dawdling and get up.

466
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,730
Hurry up.

467
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,550
What should we do later?

468
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,410
Mrs. Li definitely hopes

469
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,640
us can be adopted.

470
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,830
But we can't

471
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,550
have different parents

472
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,700
in different worlds.

473
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,340
Besides, you have your dad

474
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,780
although he doesn't recognize you now.

475
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,180
There's nothing to worry about.

476
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,660
It's hard to let someone adopt you.

477
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,280
But it's easy not to let them adopt you.

478
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,470
Right.

479
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,460
Come in. Come in.

480
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,190
Hello, Mrs. Li.

481
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:22,790
Hello, Mrs. Li.

482
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,380
Hello. Hello.

483
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,660
Let me introduce them.

484
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,430
They are Dang Aimin and Lin Zhaoxi.

485
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,240
They are Mr. Jia and Mrs. Jia.

486
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,580
Say hello to them.

487
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,050
Hello, uncle and aunt.

488
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:32,760
Good children.

489
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,110
Good children. Hello. Hello.

490
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:34,930
Sit down. Sit down.

491
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,500
Have a seat.

492
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,310
Mrs. Li,

493
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,700
can I ask

494
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,470
some questions to them?

495
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,250
Of course. Go ahead.

496
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,430
I want

497
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,660
to ask you

498
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,760
about your dreams.

499
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:53,900
Tell them.

500
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,580
I want to be an actor.

501
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,490
That's great.

502
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,110
You have ambition.

503
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:00,660
What about you,

504
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:01,270
little girl?

505
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:02,980
I haven't made up my mind yet.

506
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,760
She's still young. She hasn't decided yet.

507
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,380
Yes, she's still young. It's okay.

508
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,130
Take your time.

509
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,890
How much pocket money do you spend

510
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:09,830
per month?

511
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,190
The welfare home

512
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,310
gives us 50 yuan

513
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,450
every month.

514
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,630
We usually use the money

515
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,970
to buy books or stationery.

516
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,010
Then, save up the extra money.

517
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,130
What good children.

518
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,710
It's good to read books.

519
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,640
And you don't waste money .

520
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,610
Yes, they can save money.

521
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,860
Can you tell us

522
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:26,930
the books you like to read?

523
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:27,460
Yes.

524
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,570
The Phenomenology of Spirit,

525
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:32,970
Truth and Method,

526
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,230
Existentialism

527
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,620
is A Kind of Humanism,

528
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,720
and so on.

529
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,020
It's quite deep.

530
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:39,580
Very deep.

531
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,980
I've never heard of the book.

532
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,260
It's quite profound. It's profound.

533
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,490
What are you talking about?

534
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,520
When did you read those books?

535
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:47,530
I have read them.

536
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,390
I can recite some paragraphs.

537
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,110
You can recite some paragraphs?

538
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,900
You can recite them?

539
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,190
About the ego and composition

540
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,330
from the consciousness,

541
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,860
the difference

542
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,460
between themselves and the entity of targets

543
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,680
is their inherent difference.

544
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,740
It's a normal denial factor.

545
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,050
We will regard

546
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,820
the denial factor

547
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,900
as the common deficiency

548
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:06,820
of the opposing parties.

549
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,440
However,

550
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,680
the denial factor

551
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,430
has its unique soul.

552
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,540
It's a spirit in motion.

553
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,500
She has really read this book.

554
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,270
She has really read this book.

555
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:17,830
Sometimes,

556
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,690
I think about the meaning of our lives.

557
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:21,700
Sometimes I think

558
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:22,720
the life is meaningless.

559
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,270
What do you think, uncle and aunt?

560
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,620
I...

561
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,360
Lin Zhaoxi.

562
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,610
Lin Zhaoxi usually likes to joke.

563
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:34,210
Is it true?

564
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:35,950
Am I right? You like to joke, right?

565
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,060
Well.

566
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,180
What about Dang Aimin?

567
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,730
What hobbies do you have?

568
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,100
Yeah, what hobbies do you have?

569
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,200
I like natural science.

570
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:45,590
Natural science is good.

571
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,420
Natural science is good.

572
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,620
Then, tell us about it.

573
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,460
Tell us.

574
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,070
Have you heard of

575
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,380
the scratching reaction?

576
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,370
No, we haven't.

577
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,690
First, cut off

578
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,500
the brain of a frog.

579
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:58,890
Then, use a piece of paper

580
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,300
with low concentrations of sulfuric acid

581
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,900
to smear the frog's abdomen.

582
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,600
After the frog is stimulated,

583
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:04,800
it will use its back limbs

584
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,620
to scratch the smeared part.

585
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,170
It will look like a zombie.

586
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,960
This is because there is also a nerve center

587
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,190
in the frog's spinal cord.

588
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,840
This is the scratching reaction.

589
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:15,330
Dang Aimin.

590
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,380
What are you talking about?

591
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,210
I'm telling the truth.

592
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,590
Sit down. Don't talk nonsense.

593
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,220
You can take a frog to have a try if you don't believe me.

594
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:23,820
Shut up!

595
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,470
Look at these two kids.

596
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,310
It's okay. It's good.

597
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,380
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

598
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,220
Look.

599
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:30,970
Thank you.

600
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,950
Sorry.

601
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,750
These two kids

602
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,310
are not usually like this.

603
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,160
Well.

604
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,040
They have no psychological problems.

605
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,910
It's okay, Mrs. Li.

606
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:44,740
Actually, both of us

607
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,640
can realize that

608
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:46,790
they don't want to

609
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,500
to go with us.

610
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:47,880
Yes.

611
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,840
I understand it. We won't force you.

612
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,940
Sorry. Sorry.

613
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:51,980
It's okay. We're leaving.

614
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,710
We're leaving, Mrs. Li.

615
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,840
Thank you. Bye.

616
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,390
See you.

617
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,500
OK. Bye. Bye.

618
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,130
The scratching reaction you said

619
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:04,880
was amazing.

620
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:05,960
I heard it from Lu.

621
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,230
He knows that?

622
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,720
He studied medicine as an undergraduate.

623
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,790
What you said was indeed awesome.

624
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,520
I can understand every word.

625
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,670
But I can't understand them when they were put together.

626
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,540
Are you satisfied now?

627
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:21,420
Mrs. Li.

628
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,350
We just don't want to

629
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,340
leave the welfare home.

630
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,340
Shut up!

631
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:27,660
Lin Zhaoxi.

632
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,920
Was it your idea?

633
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,340
Yes.

634
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,660
I don't understand

635
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,540
what you are thinking about.

636
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:38,550
Do you want to stay at the welfare home

637
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:39,570
for the rest of your life?

638
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:41,910
I don't think that stay at the welfare home

639
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,980
is bad.

640
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,770
How long can the welfare home raise you?

641
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,690
What will you do in the future?

642
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,160
Okay, I'm going all out.

643
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,420
I'll pay for your senior high school education.

644
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,260
What will you do for the college education?

645
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,340
I can study on a work-study basis.

646
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,500
You're only 11 years old.

647
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,700
Do you know

648
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,800
what the society is like?

649
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,190
If a girl

650
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,290
has no education background and no family members,

651
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,110
do you know what her will face

652
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,410
in this society?

653
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,670
I used to be an orphan.

654
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,230
I know how hard it is.

655
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,740
So I don't want you

656
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:15,770
do this.

657
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,660
Mrs. Li.

658
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,550
I didn't mean to offend you.

659
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,670
I just have my own ideas.

660
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,140
You have your own ideas, right?

661
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,450
Okay, come with me.

662
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:29,200
Come here.

663
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,780
Take a look.

664
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,540
You wrote this last year.

665
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,250
I hope I can be adopted

666
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,330
by a warm family.

667
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,290
My parents will love me.

668
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,880
I'll study hard

669
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,900
and make progress every day.

670
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:54,030
When I grow up,

671
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,530
I'll repay my parents who raise me.

672
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,740
I'll also repay the aunts in the welfare home.

673
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,830
I'll help

674
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,900
more people like me.

675
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,980
You used to have your own ideas.

676
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,370
I don't know

677
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,050
why you've changed.

678
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,570
You think you've grown up,

679
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,280
but you're actually childish.

680
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,710
You refused to go

681
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,170
to a good growth environment.

682
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:15,580
How can you help other unfortunate people

683
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,280
in the future?

684
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,400
I think

685
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,340
even if I grow up in a welfare home,

686
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:29,760
as long as I work hard,

687
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,030
I can still be a useful adult.

688
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,430
Then you have to work

689
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,200
10 or 100 times harder than others.

690
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,540
You shouldn't suffer this.

691
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,900
Mrs. Li, I'm sorry.

692
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:45,310
I apologize for my willfulness today.

693
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,140
I understand your kindness.

694
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,070
But I still insist on

695
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,060
my own ideas.

696
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,370
What are your ideas?

697
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,390
Come, sit down.

698
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,580
I know

699
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,230
you think Hua Juan and I

700
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,570
are not normal recently.

701
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,910
Actually, we have

702
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,860
our goal.

703
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,260
We've been working hard

704
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,290
to achieve the goal these days.

705
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,130
What is the goal?

706
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,220
Enter Zhang Shuping’s

707

708

and become a representative

709

710

The gold medal of Olympic mathematics competition.

714

We want to prove ourselves.

We want to prove ourselves

I thought he was my uncle.

774
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,140
He was just like anyone's uncle.

♫Something good, something great♫

Countless elegiac couplets

the scores of Olympic mathematics competitions of our city were not satisfied.

The Jin's Olympic Mathematics Competition

805

♫And gone with my life better♫

813
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,760
which forces the parents to send their children to study Olympic mathematics.

814
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:12,770
This is against

815
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,870
the original purpose of Olympic mathematics education.

816
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,110
And there is the suspicion

817
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,220
of undermining educational equity.

818
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,570
There's a lot of controversy outside.

819
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,080
We should pay attention to that.

820

Anyway,

821
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,220
we can't always

be the last one in group competitions.

823

When I went to the provincial meeting last time,

824
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,060
they laughed at us for this.

825

Director Sun, cramming for the competition

826
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,570
makes me feel worried.

827
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:33,300
Don't worry.

828
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,980

This plan is very detailed.

Many details

00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,470
I admire you.

838
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,020
But isn't your way of treating students

839
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,130
a little too rigorous?

840

I know your ability clearly.

Your students have won the team champions many times.

844
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:20,430
You can be called

But,

847
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,510
I need to think more about it.

848
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,030

00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,020
I have made my requirements.

852
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:33,420
First,

853
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,810
I need to be totally independent.

854
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:36,220
Second,

855
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,690
I need the three-month use rights

856
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,760
of the Oasis Camp.

857
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:40,750
Third,

858
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,940
I need some support

859
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,700
of the department of mathematics of Sanwei University.

860
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:44,900
About these three requirements,

861
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,080
Director Sun has already promised me.

862
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,140
What you're worried about

863
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:49,940
are no more than

864
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,170
psychological problems of students

865
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,740
and the acceptance of parents.

866
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,140
With all due respect,

867
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,910
these are not important.

868
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:55,980
Without pressure,

869
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:56,880
there is no achievement.

870
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,510
We need to let students and parents

871
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:00,420
understand the truth

872
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,160
that the Olympic mathematics isn't a shortcut.

873
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:03,500
It's impossible for students

874
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,510
to rely on the Olympic mathematics

875
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,700
to get higher education easily.

876
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,490
In a way,

877
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,030
it will be crueler than the college entrance exam.

878
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:12,900
Everyone,

879
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:14,740
after the summer vacation,

880
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,240
you'll be in sixth grade.

881
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,510
I hope you can

882
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,300
spend a summer vacation happily.

883
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,700
But you can't

884
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:22,640
neglect your study.

885
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,350
The summer vacation homework

886
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,860
must be finished carefully.

887
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,760
You can't rush to finish it

888
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,520
before the next term begins.

889
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,320
During this summer,

890
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,340
I will randomly do home visits

891
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,190
to check everyone's

892
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,020
studying progress.

893
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:40,780
Moreover,

894
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,050
the three students, Lu Zhihao,

895
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,040
Lin Zhaoxi,

896
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,610
and Dang Aimin,

897
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,430
signed up for the Olympic mathematics training camp.

898
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,610
They are very brave.

899
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:48,950
We also hope

900
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,380
they can enter the camp successfully.

901
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,680
Let's applaud

902
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,910
and cheer for them.

903
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,420
OK.

904
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,960
Remember to bring all the things in your desks

905
00:31:58,990 --> 00:31:59,710
back home.

906
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,700
I hereby announce

907
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,010
the summer vacation begins.

908
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,530
You two are going to the camp too?

909
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,570
What? We can't?

910
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:11,940
No.

911
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,670
Why not have fun during the summer vacation?

912
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,480
Why do you have to find an exam for yourself?

913
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,660
You need to study for it.

914
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,860
But you also signed up for the exam.

915
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,110
My dad said

916
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,460
if I could attend the Jin's Competition,

917
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,680
he would buy me a computer

918
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:23,390
to play the World of Warcraft.

919
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,300
Let's go.

920
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,190
Are you two qualified?

921
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,520
What do you mean?

922
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,030
Don't cry if you fail.

923
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,790
What did he say?

924
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,550
I think you should

925
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,470
find another agent when you go back.

926
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,680
The salary of the worker working for you

927
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,360
for seven days is a gold bar.

928
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:48,710
You need to

929
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,400
pay him every night.

930
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,220
No credit or extra payment.

931
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,120
What is the minimum number of times

932
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,210
the gold bar needs to be cut

933
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:54,960
to meet your requirement?

934
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,310
A twice. B three times.

935
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,860
C four times. D six times.

936
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,460
We should choose...

937
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:01,130
A.

938
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,570
A?

939
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:04,790
Twice?

940
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,480
It can only divide the bar into three parts.

941
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,460
How do you pay him?

942
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,780
Are you stupid?

943
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,470
Who tells you to divide it equally?

944
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,060
Look carefully.

945
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,430
Divided the bar into three sections

946
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:22,790
according to the ratio of one to two to four.

947
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,700
One, two, four.

948
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,940
On the first day,

949
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,880
give him the first part.

950
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,670
On the second day, give him the second part

951
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,820
and get the first one back.

952
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,900
On the third day, give him the first part.

953
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,740
On the fourth day, give him the third part

954
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,180
and get the first and second parts back.

955
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,420
The fifth day.

956
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,080
The sixth day.

957
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:47,980
On the last day,

958
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,550
give the first part

959
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,440
to him.

960
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:55,250
Right.

961
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,190
Why didn't I think of this method?

962
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:58,920
You're stupid.

963
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,250
No.

964
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,210
I definitely knew this question when I was young.

965
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,020
Why can't I do it when I grow up?

966
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,180
How long has it been

967
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,100
since you studied math?

968
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,370
I haven't learned it since the college entrance exam.

969
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,300
I don't even want to count the money.

970
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,989
That's the reason.

971
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,719
Teach me.

972
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,190
Otherwise, it is useless for you

973
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:19,520
to enter the training camp alone.

974
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:20,310
If anyone is missing,

975
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,699
the photo can't be taken.

976
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:24,060
I can't teach you.

977
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,739
But someone can teach you.

978
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:33,929
Don't say that person is your dad.

979
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:34,739
I'm afraid he'll kick me.

980
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:36,139
I can't stand it.

981
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:37,120
Otherwise, you can't

982
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:37,820
take that photo.

983
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,820
I mean Pei Zhi.

984
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:43,830
Triple plus one.

985
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,020
Double two.

986
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,030
You go.

987
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:53,580
Three.

988
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,540
Black joker.

989
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,280
Red joker.

990
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,900
One card left.

991
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:03,730
Bomb.

992
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,050
You go.

993
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,790
Jack. Queen. King. Ace. I win.

994
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:13,920
Take them back.

995
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,230
You can't play four cards at the same time.

996
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,940
I did it one by one.

997
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,540
The card you left

998
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:18,570
is either a jack or six.

999
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:19,810
Neither of the two is higher than mine.

1000
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:24,110
Son, you're great.

1001
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:24,780
Shuffle the cards.

1002
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,060
We agreed that we couldn't count cards.

1003
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:28,140
You still counted them.

1004
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:28,970
It's all your fault.

1005
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,590
Sorry, it was my instinct.

1006
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,600
I couldn't control myself.

1007
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,060
Why are you apologizing?

1008
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,490
It's your ability to count cards.

1009
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,670
You can do it too if you can.

1010
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,230
You can't accept that your son defeated you.

1011
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,690
Next time, my cards will be full of bombs.

1012
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,400
You can't count them.

1013
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,090
You need to be focused when playing Go.

1014
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,120
You're not focused enough.

1015
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,170
Zhang Liang, I need to go out.

1016
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,780
No, you can't leave until we finish it.

1017
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,450
I can win this time.

1018
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,740
You've lost.

1019
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:08,870
I...

1020
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,100
You're not focused enough.

1021
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,700
The loser should clean up the board.

1022
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:23,720
Pei Zhi, I'll defeat you sooner or later.

1023
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,830
Pei. Pei.

1024
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:27,710
Please help me. Please help me.

1025
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,610
Please help me.

1026
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:29,860
What's happened?

1027
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,070
Have you heard

1028
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,340
Zhang Shuping's Olympic mathematics training camp?

1029
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,640
Yes.

1030
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,450
I want to enter it.

1031
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,700
Can you teach me the Olympic mathematics?

1032
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,050
I don't know how to teach.

1033
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,710
Pei. Pei.

1034
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,510
As long as you are willing,

1035
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,260
you will be able to teach me.

1036
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,410
You're such a good actor to play a poor boy.

1037
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,300
Lin Zhaoxi, do you want to learn too?

1038
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:49,380
No.

1039
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:50,790
She's a genius compared to me.

1040
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,820
Just teach me.

1041
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,700
Does Hongxing Elementary School have any genius?

1042
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:55,600
Pei Zhi.

1043
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,110
Don't play

1044
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:57,810
with these poor students.

1045
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:59,740
Who is this guy?

1046
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,010
He's my classmate. He's also my neighbour.

1047
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:03,580
Zhang Liang.

1048
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,660
Zhang Liang?

1049
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,630
You are Zhang Liang?

1050
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,500
Zhang Liang

1051
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,820
is the best student of our school.

1052
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:10,380
His family is also well-off.

1053
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,580
But Ji Jiang is handsome too.

1054
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,340
He looks so dull.

1055
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,990
Shouldn't Pei Zhi be the best student?

1056
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:22,950
So you've been so offensive

1057
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,270
since you were young.

1058
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:25,700
Pei Zhi.

1059
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,180
don't play with them.

1060
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,930
If you become stupid, you're not qualified

1061
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,910
to be my opponent.

1062
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:31,900
I remember

1063
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,140
he was in your class during senior high school.

1064
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:34,970
Yes, he was always the second.

1065
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,130
He was much worse than Pei.

1066
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,280
Pei Zhi.

1067
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,960
My mom will pick me up later.

1068
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:39,880
Let's go home together.

1069
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:40,880
No need for that.

1070
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,770
I'll go back by myself.

1071
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:44,400
They are my friends.

1072
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:45,980
Friends?

1073
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,500
I'm your classmate and neighbor.

1074
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:51,980
They are your friends.

1075
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:53,900
Do poor students from a poor school

1076
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,140
deserve to be your friends?

1077
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,820
You're only a primary school student.

1078
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,290
Why do you have a sense of superiority?

1079
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:58,910
Doesn't your school

1080
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,140
teach you morals?

1081
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:01,950
What? Do you think

1082
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,860
there's no distinction between high and low schools?

1083
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,460
Of course.

1084
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,500
But the brains have.

1085
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,910
You're stupid. You're trash.

1086
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:07,530
You...

1087
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,660
Forget it.

1088
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,780
Forget it. Forget it.

1089
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,500
Don't talk to stupid people.

1090
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,990
We can tell who is stupid by comparison.

1091
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,640
Zhang Liang, don't be ridiculous.

1092
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:18,100
I just want to see

1093
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:18,930
what your friends are.

1094
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:20,700
What do you think?

1095
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,870
The genius from Hongxing Elementary School.

1096
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,470
Do you dare to play?

1097
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:26,990
Why not?

1098
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:28,540
Xi, you're so cool.

1099
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,610
What do you want to do?

1100
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,270
Make a set of

1101
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,360
Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children

1102
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,460
or Raven Progressive Matrices?

1103
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,380
What?

1104
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,550
I don't think he's heard of it.

1105
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,160
Don't need that.

1106
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,760
Let's play a game.

1107
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:44,740
Come on.

1108
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,100
There are 17 beans here.

1109
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,340
Let's take turns to take them.

1110
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,150
Take one to three beans each time.

1111
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,190
You must take it.

1112
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,030
The winner is to get the last bean.

1113
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,020
Who goes first?

1114
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,460
By throwing the coin?

1115
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:01,970
Let's take turns.

1116
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,700
I'll go first in the first round.

1117
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,340
OK, you go first.

1118
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,900
Take in turns from m things

1119
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,280
in total

1120
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,840
with the rule that only n things can be taken at a time.

1121
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,490
This is the Bash Game.

1122
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,690
You know it, right?

1123
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:21,670
You have learned it too?

1124
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:24,590
I underestimated you.

1125
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,400
You win this time.

1126
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,420
How did you win?

1127
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:31,770
There are 17 beans.

1128
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,780
They can only take one to three beans each time.

1129
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:35,730
If there are four beans left,

1130
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,820
the player who will take beans in the next round will lose.

1131
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,360
Therefore, to get the winning point,

1132
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,900
there should be 4, 8,

1133
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,140
12 or 16 beans left.

1134
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,140
Then, the person can win.

1135
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,580
So, Lin Zhaoxi,

1136
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:47,740
when you took a bean

1137
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:48,650
for the first time,

1138
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,740
you have already won.

1139
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,460
Don't be too proud.

1140
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,380
It's too easy to play with 17 beans.

1141
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,060
Wait for me here if you dare.

1142
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,220
Lin Zhaoxi, you're great.

1143
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:02,620
It's just the basic knowledge.

1144
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,340
Zhang Liang

1145
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,590
is obviously trying his best

1146
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,540
to show himself off greatly.

1147
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,850
Let's we leave now.

1148
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,100
He'll be furious when he comes back.

1149
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:14,940
No need for that.

1150
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,310
Don't forget

1151
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:17,710
he is also one of the core characters

1152
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:18,410
of that photo.

1153
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,020
It's not bad to get to know him.

1154
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:21,760
I want to see

1155
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,650
what tricks he can play.

1156
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,100
What are you talking about?

1157
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,530
Nothing.

1158
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:29,500
Let's go.

1159
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,080
Jia Bing.

1160
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:50,580
Liu Xu.

1161
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:51,000
Zhang Liang.

1162
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:51,620
Shi Zhe.

1163
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,210
Chen Chengcheng.

1164
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,340
We are

1165
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:54,750
Winning Five Tigers.

1166
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:02,740
Hua Juan.

1167
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,910
They are trying to steal your job

1168
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,780
and debut as a group.

1169
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,400
Let me laugh for a while.

1170
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:10,740
Laugh.

1171
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,540
I'll make you cry later.

1172
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:15,780
Go.

1173
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,350
Why is he

1174
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:18,770
so hostile?

1175
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,140
That's how little boys are.

1176
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:23,920
A little silly.

1177
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:25,590
Am I right, Pei?

1178
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,460
Are they silly?

1179
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:35,790
Have a seat.

1180
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,180
Do you want to play Go with me?

1181
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,290
It's still the game we played just now.

1182
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,370
There's no distinction between black and white.

1183
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,190
You can only take one to five pieces each time.

1184
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:54,800
Who takes the last one wins.

1185
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:56,020
Do you dare to play?

1186
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:57,560
That's not fair.

1187
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,990
You are the ones who bring the pieces.

1188
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,670
Who knows how many pieces there are?

1189
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,360
Estimating the total number is a basic skill.

1190
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:03,390
We don't count them.

1191
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:04,410
You can also

1192
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,610
add more pieces.

1193
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,310
You want to compete

1194
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,900
the rapid calculation with me?

1195
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:10,880
Exactly.

1196
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,340
How about I play for you?

1197
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,160
Pei Zhi.

1198
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:15,350
This is a battle

1199
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,370
between Experimental and Hongxing Elementary School.

1200
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:18,170
Do you want to help the enemies?

1201
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:19,990
There are no enemies here.

1202
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:20,950
I don't think

1203
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:22,650
this is a battle between Hongxing and Experimental Elementary School.

1204
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,150
Otherwise, you won't be the one

1205
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:24,980
representing Experimental School.

1206
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,190
It's okay. I'll do it.

1207
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,390
Where did they go?

1208
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,610
You stay here.

1209
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,360
I'll take a look.

1210
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,220
Let's start.

1211
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:40,080
You go first.

1212
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,780
Stop!

1213
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,670
There's a battle between Hongxing Elementary School

1214
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,390
and Experimental Elementary School.

1215
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,060
Those from Experimental Elementary School,

1216
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,340
stand up and follow me.

1217
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,390
I wondered where you went.

1218
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,140
You're finding audience.

1219
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:56,450
Those from Hongxing Elementary School,

1220
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,500
stand up!
