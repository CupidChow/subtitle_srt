4
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,060
Later, she found her biological father.

5
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,940
She begged her father

6
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,780
who's my father now

7
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:45,729
to adopt me.

8
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,250
Now the three of us

9
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,470
are a happy family.

10
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,539
Although we lead a modest life,

11
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,280
I always enjoy the happiness.

12
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,509
And I hope

13
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:58,470
my father and my sister

14
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,460
can be happy all the time.

15
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,500
Even if we encounter some difficulties in life,

16
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,270
it's no big deal

17
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:04,860
as long as

18
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,460
we are together.

19
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,460
Are you crying?

20
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:17,850
That's not like you.

21
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:25,670
I think

22
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,780
it's a sincere performance.

23
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,530
Hope to meet you in the next round.

24
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,340
Me too.

25
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,300
Yes!

26
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,660
Now,

27
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,020
it's up to Miss Zhong.

28
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,140
Have you changed your mind?

29
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,500
I'm always against histrionics

30
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,579
and sensationalism.

31
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:43,970
However,

32
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,380
I've found

33
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,510
your whole performance

34
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,700
full of heartfelt emotions,

35
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,410
which has changed my opinion of you.

36
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,910
Even though it is

37
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,160
carefully designed,

38
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,140
I have to admit

39
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,690
you did a great job.

40
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,900
Hope you can practice more.

41
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,620
You've passed.

42
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,500
Congratulations.

43
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,340
Come on. Try harder.

44
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:06,930
Thank you.

45
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,890
He made it.

46
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:39,280
Good.

47
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,300
Pei Zhi has made great progress.

48
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:43,380
He has

49
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,790
a talent for it.

50
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,540
Not bad.

51
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,880
Stop pretending.

52
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:51,790
I know

53
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,410
you must be very proud.

54
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:54,980
I'll punch you.

55
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:56,890
Come on.

56
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,530
It's been a long time since we fought.

57
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,060
Let's have a game.

58
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:02,660
Hai.

59
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,660
Stop. Stop.

60
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,460
Mr. Pei and I

61
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,530
will have a fight.

62
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,470
Bro,

63
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,200
why did you become so fierce?

64
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,210
I suddenly had an inkling.

65
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,520
How could you suddenly have it?

66
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,550
How could it be?

67
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,620
Tell me the secret.

68
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:35,510
Hai,

69
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,930
wait until

70
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,370
I summarize the skills.

71
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,270
Then I'll tell you.

72
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,680
Really? I'll take it seriously.

73
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:42,340
Of course.

74
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,170
Keep your word.

75
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,659
I will.

76
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,400
By the way,

77
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,060
Mr. Yu

78
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,040
doesn't look well lately.

79
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,370
Take him to the hospital

80
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,130
and have him checked up.

81
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,020
Check up?

82
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,730
He's not going.

83
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,240
I asked him before.

84
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,700
You know what?

85
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,510
When he knew it costs money,

86
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,290
he refused.

87
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:01,660
Hey,

88
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,740
you must listen to me.

89
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,760
Mr. Yu often smokes and drinks.

90
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,980
There could be something wrong with his liver.

91
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,340
If he's really sick,

92
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,410
early detection offers early treatment.

93
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,870
He must have a check-up.

94
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,500
I can follow your advice,

95
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,000
but he won't follow mine.

96
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,180
Give you a tip then.

97
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,230
Just pay the fee

98
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,310
for medical check-up in advance.

99
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,380
Tell him you won it in a lucky draw.

100
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,720
Mr. Yu will definitely go.

101
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,660
A prize in the lucky draw?

102
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,580
Well, a nice excuse.

103
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,659
You're so smart.

104
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,120
What are you doing?

105
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,300
Writing a program.

106
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,240
Can you teach me

107
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,830
programming and math modeling?

108
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:51,940
Why do you want to learn it?

109
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,430
You want to

110
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,340
use the math modeling

111
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,659
with data and program

112
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,190
to calculate

113
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,460
where Lin had the accident.

114
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,560
How can you guess that?

115
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,220
Nice idea.

116
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,310
But the problem is that

117
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,840
I don't know programming

118
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,150
or math modeling.

119
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,580
Can you teach me?

120
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,860
I won't teach you.

121
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:15,930
Why?

122
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,250
Because I don't want to go back.

123
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,820
And I don't want you to do so.

124
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,340
Stand up.

125
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:35,940
Good morning.

126
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,860
Good morning.

127
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,020
Have a seat.

128
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,780
Sir, Pei Zhi brought his laptop to class.

129
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:49,880
Pei Zhi.

130
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:50,990
Don't bring

131
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,970
anything irrelevant.

132
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,110
It will distract

133
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,540
the classmates who's less determined.

134
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,380
Got it.

135
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,020
Today,

136
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,159
we will talk about

137
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,170
the properties of inequality.

138
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,620
That's it?

139
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,040
The second property.

140
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,180
If a is greater than b,

141
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,330
and b is greater than c,

142
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,690
then a is greater than c.

143
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:21,790
From the above two properties,

144
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,180
we can deduce another one.

145
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,740
If c is less than b, and b is less than a,

146
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:26,830
then c...

147
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,340
Sir.

148
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,620
Lin Zhaoxi is reading other books.

149
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,020
Lean back.

150
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:52,770
Where is your romance novel?

151
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:53,420
Where did you hide it?

152
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,620
That one in your hand.

153
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:01,940
Pei Zhi.

154
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,130
Is this the book she was reading?

155
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,650
[Neural Networks and Applications]

156
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,790
Yes.

157
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:06,880
I'll confiscate your book.

158
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,480
Come to my office after class.

159
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:11,590
No way.

160
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,430
Pei Zhi brought his laptop.

161
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,200
But you didn't confiscate it.

162
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,180
Hey, he's Pei Zhi.

163
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,420
But who are you?

164
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,740
Again?

165
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,620
What's wrong with them?

166
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,050
Another quarrel?

167
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't know.

168
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,480
The third one, if a is greater than b,

169
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,620
then a plus c is greater than b plus c.

170
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,470
That means if you add the same number

171
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,760
to both sides of an inequality...

172
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:42,820
Tell me.

173
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:44,640
Who asked you to learn this?

174
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,260
I made the decision myself.

175
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,830
You haven't mastered math for high school yet.

176
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:49,950
Do you have time to do this?

177
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,560
I've mastered it completely.

178
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,470
I don't need to learn it anymore.

179
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,700
Completely?

180
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,210
You only got 88 points

181
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,410
in the last math exam.

182
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,010
You didn't even pass it.

183
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,660
88.

184
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,260
What a lucky number, sir.

185
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,310
I could solve all the questions.

186
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,170
Lin Zhaoxi.

187
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,550
Are you trying to piss me off?

188
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,510
Then, Mr. Xie,

189
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,360
how about giving me another test?

190
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,580
I'll show you now.

191
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,450
Miss Tong.

192
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,380
Well,

193
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,700
can you give me a piece of test paper

194
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,930
that you printed yesterday.

195
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,740
Here you are.

196
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:32,500
Thank you.

197
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,070
You're welcome.

198
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,900
These are questions of the college entrance exam last year.

199
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,060
Sit here.

200
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:42,980
The maximum is 150.

201
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:43,950
I'll watch you.

202
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,110
Scratch paper.

203
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,020
Sir, I need scratch paper.

204
00:09:58,730 --> 00:09:59,660
I'll check the time for you.

205
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,180
You have two hours at most.

206
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,080
Don't worry.

207
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,170
I'll finish it before lunch.

208
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,120
I won't waste your lunchtime.

209
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:13,570
Mr. Xie,

210
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,820
I've never seen you so serious.

211
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:20,970
Since I've never seen

212
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:21,920
such a stubborn student.

213
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,430
Review what we learned

214
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,510
in this class.

215
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,380
I'll arrange for a test.

216
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:52,730
Class is over.

217
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:53,950
Stand up.

218
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,500
Goodbye, teacher.

219
00:10:58,690 --> 00:10:59,410
Goodbye.

220
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,790
Lin Zhaoxi hasn't come back

221
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,500
for a whole class.

222
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,140
What happened between you two?

223
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,620
It has nothing to do with you.

224
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,620
That's it.

225
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,090
They definitely become enemies.

226
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,450
His personality has totally changed.

227
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,810
What one can't get becomes concerns.

228
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,430
Couples who spend day and night will get tired of each other.

229
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,350
Take it as a lesson.

230
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,740
He is so perceptive, right?

231
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,020
Done.

232
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,980
Just over an hour.

233
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:50,770
You finished it?

234
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,730
141 points.

235
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,860
Only one multiple question

236
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,010
and one sub-question are wrong.

237
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,650
That's impossible.

238
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,100
Do you believe me now?

239
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,340
I know.

240
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,460
This is last year's test.

241
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,700
You must have done it.

242
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:29,490
You know the answers, right?

243
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,110
This is the first time

244
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,340
I saw these questions, sir.

245
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:32,940
I don't believe it.

246
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,390
How could you

247
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:34,990
finish it

248
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:35,820
with both high speed and accuracy.

249
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,460
Mr. Xie, let me have a look.

250
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,560
I've randomly drawn another test.

251
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,460
You can continue this afternoon.

252
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,510
If you still

253
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,380
get high accuracy,

254
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,270
I'll return the book to you

255
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,660
and make an apology.

256
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,820
Okay, I'll do it.

257
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,500
Can't wait, sir.

258
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,210
I don't want lunch.

259
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:12,830
I can do it now.

260
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,500
It's 11:38.

261
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:25,660
Start.

262
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,220
Mr. Xie.

263
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,440
I'll get you lunch from the canteen.

264
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,060
Thank you.

265
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,280
Miss Tong,

266
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,300
get one for her please.

267
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,460
Okay.

268
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,700
Let's go.

269
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,040
Well, teachers,

270
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,590
if it has satisfied your curiosity,

271
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,190
please leave.

272
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:43,580
Well...

273
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,550
it's quiet scary

274
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,420
when you're all standing behind me.

275
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,380
Look at her.

276
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,420
Not bad.

277
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,570
Principal Zhang.

278
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,340
Principal.

279
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:16,820
How long has it taken her?

280
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,260
Over half an hour.

281
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:29,620
Watch out.

282
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,820
It's lunch break.

283
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,830
How could Xi

284
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,660
still in the office?

285
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,820
Where else can she go?

286
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,150
Come with me.

287
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,450
Is she inside?

288
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:05,579
Yes.

289
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,230
But I don't know how to describe

290
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,369
what I saw just now.

291
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:10,599
Why?

292
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:11,390
What did you see?

293
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:11,980
Have a look yourself.

294
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:19,099
What's going on?

295
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,500
I don't know.

296
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,020
What should we do?

297
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,670
No matter what's going on,

298
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:25,810
I'm sure we can't help

299
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,349
on this occasion.

300
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,480
Let's go have lunch.

301
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,660
We can cheer her up while eating.

302
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:33,890
Is it not faithful for us

303
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,040
to leave her alone like this?

304
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,500
You wanna go in?

305
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,800
No.

306
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,810
Come on. Let's go.

307
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:41,700
Done.

308
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,140
How did you teach her?

309
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,260
It's not over yet. All correct.

310
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,160
She didn't give up.

311
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,400
143?

312
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,810
148!

313
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,050
Incredible.

314
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:44,980
Principal Zhang,

315
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,700
she just answered another one.

316
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:47,880
Got 141.

317
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,210
Mr. Xie.

318
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,860
There are talents everywhere in your class.

319
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,310
One is Pei Zhi.

320
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,740
Now you have Lin Zhaoxi.

321
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,140
Mr. Xie, my book...

322
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:00,620
Put it down.

323
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,040
Come with me.

324
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,500
Tell me.

325
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,500
Why did you get low scores on purpose?

326
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,500
Because I love

327
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,400
the atmosphere of Class 13.

328
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,020
Very harmonious.

329
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,460
I don't want to leave Class 13.

330
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,620
And we got you,

331
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:21,230
such a brilliant teacher.

332
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,290
Don't lie to me.

333
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:26,890
Then what do you think?

334
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,930
How could I know?

335
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,300
Well, Lin Zhaoxi.

336
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,420
The school has its division system.

337
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,860
You have good grades.

338
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,080
You should come to Class 1.

339
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:39,530
Miss Ma.

340
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,710
You can't take my student away

341
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,380
in front of me.

342
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,550
Thanks. But...

343
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,270
I'm afraid

344
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,780
I'll fight with Zhang Liang in your class.

345
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,630
Look at her.

346
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,060
Lin Zhaoxi.

347
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,380
As long as you don't affect others,

348
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:53,920
you can stay

349
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,890
in whichever class

350
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,410
and learn whatever you want.

351
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,650
I have the say.

352
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,060
Thank you, Snape.

353
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,760
Oh, thank you, Principal Zhang.

354
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,470
Good girl.

355
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:11,560
Take it.

356
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:12,710
Bye, sir.

357
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,100
Wait.

358
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,010
I should apologize.

359
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,070
I'm leaving.

360
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,890
Children's play.

361
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,960
How does it feel to play tricks?

362
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:52,750
Remind you.

363
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,660
We are enemies now.

364
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,630
Don't try to stop me from going home.

365
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,490
Still a few months left.

366
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:01,780
Let's wait.

367
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:06,970
You're right.

368
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,890
They're enemies.

369
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:26,590
♫Please don't worry, my dear, cuz I'm on my way♫

370
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:34,250
♫I'm hurrying home to you and I won't be late♫

Let's go.

378
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,140
I don't want to distract her.

379
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:05,980
So I want to change my seat.

380
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,140
Which one do you want?

381
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,100
The last row.

382
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,810

00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,140
In the research

397
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,070
on the optimal concentration

398
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,140

♫You're on my mind every day♫

00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,450
Okay.

425
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:58,870
Stop.

426
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,130
I mean, dad,

427
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,820
how about being a traffic cop?

428
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,450
It's good.

429
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,030
Laborious, though.

430
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:16,540
Well.

431
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:22,100
Do you like to be a traffic policeman?

432
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,460
I do.

433
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,190
Fine.

434
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,780
Have a seat.

435
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:32,860
Have some water.

436
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,240
Listen.

437
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,710
I can do

438
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,890
my favorite job,

439
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:37,990
and support our family.

440
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,150
What a nice work.

441
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,140
If one day,

442
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,020
I can make a lot of money,

443
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,250
will you consider quitting?

444
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,300
When you become successful,

445
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,440
I'll certainly quit.

446
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,540
I'll take advantage of my son then.

447
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,830
I can play boxing and go fishing every day.

448
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,140
What a comfortable life!

449
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,180
I got it.

450
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,950
I'm just kidding.

451
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,340
It doesn't matter if you succeed or not.

452
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,600
I want you to be healthy,

453
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,100
and keep fighting.

454
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,790
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

455
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,260
Don't worry.

456
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,460
I never feel over-stressed.

457
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:08,650
Mr. Charlie,

458
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,550
there's a new chess battle game

459
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,280
on the platform,

460
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,520
called Auto Chess Battle.

461
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,940
It's now available by free download.

462
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,590
It has the potential to add

463
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,830
paid content like skin selling.

464
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,430
I take an optimistic view.

465
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,780
I think it deserves a recommendation position.

466
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,460
Which company did it?

467
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:23,540
It's called

468
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:24,500
Donglai Games Studio.

469
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:24,940
A small workshop.

470
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,840
It never showed up before.

471
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,760
A chess battle game...

472
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,500
Put it on the recommended apps list.

473
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,580
Let's see the market response in a week.

474
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,060
Got it.

475
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,780
You didn't change these parts just now.

476
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:54,010
Hai.

477
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,880
Thank you, bro.

478
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:06,780
If you hadn't insisted on bringing my dad here,

479
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:07,630
I couldn't imagine

480
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,420
what would happen to my dad.

481
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,900
I'll remember your kindness forever.

482
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,620
Don't mention it.

483
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,330
Arrange the surgery

484
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,360
for him as soon as possible.

485
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,140
-I know. -Find a way to tell him gently.

486
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,610
I'll work on it right away.

487
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:23,740
Okay.

488
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,110
I have to leave you alone.

489
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,150
I have a friend

490
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:27,750
in the hospital.

491
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,300
I'll visit him.

492
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:29,720
Leaving now.

493
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,400
Xi.

494
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,490
Let's go shopping.

495
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,180
I'm sorry.

496
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,450
I need to go to the hospital.

497
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:45,990
For what?

498
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,240
Visit a friend, Lu Zhihao.

499
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,530
Lu Zhihao?

500
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,900
The boy with bowl haircut in Class 1.

501
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,270
Bowl haircut? What bowl haircut?

502
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:55,170
Together?

503
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,280
I'm not going.

504
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,200
If he were a handsome guy, I would like to go.

505
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,060
I don't like bowl haircut.

506
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,370
I should remind you

507
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,340
that the bowl-haircut guy

508
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,570
may become good-looking after growing up.

509
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:05,660
Really?

510
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,200
Believe it or not.

511
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:08,090
Are you serious?

512
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,110
Yes.

513
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,470
Okay, I'll go.

514
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,070
I have to see him myself.

515
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:12,460
Let's go.

516
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,070
I lost the game of Go.

517
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,140
Now I lost the game of chess.

518
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,670
Pei Zhi,

519
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,260
did you practice secretly?

520
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:34,980
I've learned it from my master.

521
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:36,820
Admit your defeat?

522
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:41,660
Fine.

523
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,900
I lost. You eat.

524
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,870
I've already had three cans.

525
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,980
And so much fruit just now.

526
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,180
No way.

527
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,560
You have to eat it today.

528
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:50,880
Come on.

529
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:51,860
There are not many cans left.

530
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:55,770
Lu.

531
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,770
-I'm coming. -Lin Zhaoxi.

532
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,060
I brought you some fruit.

533
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,890
I really can't eat more.

534
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:03,820
Too much.

535
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,850
I'll put it here.

536
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,960
When will you be discharged?

537
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,180
Next Wednesday.

538
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,020
And you'll see me in plaster

539
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,200
in school soon.

540
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,370
Oh, come on.

541
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,860
Let me introduce.

542
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,950
I know her, Bao Xiaomeng.

543
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,840
Pei Zhi, Lin Zhaoxi and her

544
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:18,500
are in the same class.

545
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,400
I'm Lu Zhihao from Class 1.

546
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:23,450
Nice to meet you.

547
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,350
Hey, she's the girl

548
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,220
that you secretly watched every morning exercise?

549
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,140
Play your chess.

550
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,550
Ghost?

551
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,140
You're here too.

552
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,640
I'm not the ghost.

553
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:35,940
Hello?

554
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,280
Hold on.

555
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,380
Something is wrong with them.

556
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,580
Don't you know?

557
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,490
Know what?

558
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,110
They have been on and off many times.

559
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,450
Their relationship is confusing.

560
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,220
It's been

561
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,130
the hottest topic in Class 13 for two weeks.

562
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:06,780
Great.

563
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,910
Pei Zhi shouldn't have

564
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,750
hung out with bad students

565
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,300
like you.

566
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,550
Dragons never live with snakes.

567
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,500
Who is the snake?

568
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,610
Lin Zhaoxi is now recognized

569
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,630
as a genius by the teachers.

570
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,100
Class 13

571
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,420
is a chaotic place.

572
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:24,740
If someone always plays

573
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,100
with you who have bad grades,

574
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,200
one will become stupid.

575
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,520
You are really a lunatic.

576
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,510
As for the company's official seals,

577
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,390
can you mail them to me?

578
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:38,940
Okay, thank you.

579
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:41,380
Pei Zhi.

580
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,160
What are you busy with these days?

581
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:47,780
Busy with playing tricks.

582
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,030
Are you up to something?

583
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:50,940
Yes.

584
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,670
Since you've confessed,

585
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,680
then tell me.

586
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,930
I can't tell you yet.

587
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,220
What are you doing with that program?

588
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:04,980
It's just a game.

589
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,340
Why do you write a game?

590
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,900
You'll see in a few days.

591
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:28,270
Auntie.

592
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:28,970
Lu.

593
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,630
How are you?

594
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:31,790
Much better.

595
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,630
Much better.

596
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,750
You need a good rest now.

597
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,440
I'll leave after seeing you.

598
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,610
Thank you.

599
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:39,210
Hey.

600
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,030
Mom, how...

601
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,040
How can you visit him

602
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:41,930
with empty hands?

603
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:43,860
It's okay.

604
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,640
I'm happy

605
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:45,230
to see you.

606
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:45,940
It's okay.

607
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:46,640
Look at you.

608
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,070
Lu is more sensible than you.

609
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,230
Why are you unconfident

610
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,700
in your mom?

611
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,760
How could I come with empty hands?

612
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,060
Your father's driver is at the back.

613

He walks slowly with a lot of things in hands.

614

Where should I

615
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,340
put them?

616
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,110
Here.

617
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,010
Lu, I don't know

618
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:03,140
what you like.

619
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,320
-Mom, it's his favorite. -I bought some tremella.

620
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:05,930
He loves it very much.

called you yesterday.

about cooperation on Auto Chess Battle.

OK.

I'm weak in the matrix.

Didn't you refuse to teach me?

663
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,660
Why did you change your mind?

664
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,180
Because I'm confident.

666

They're at peace again?

671
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,100
I don't understand.

672
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,460
Their relationship

673
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,670
is more complicated than math questions.

674

Isn't it more coherent?

Sorry.

687
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,540
Yes.

688
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,340
No team?

689
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:01,850
Alone.

690
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:04,020
How old are you?

691
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,050
17. Still in high school.

692
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,100
So I'm meeting

693
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,210
a genius today.

694
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,740
Chinese are commonly smart.

695
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,560
Don't be humble.

696
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,940
You've used your spare time

697
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,700
to make such a creative

698
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,330
and perfect game.

699
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,490
You're definitely

700
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,370
not an ordinary genius.

701
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,020
Thank you.

702
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,820
Let's start our talk.

703
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,380
You can have your meal while talking.

704
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,060
Okay.

705
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:40,960
Excuse me.

706
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:41,930
I'm a reporter

707
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,780
from Anping TV Station.

708
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:43,740
May I have an interview with you?

709
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:45,870
Why me?

710
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:46,710
Knowing

711
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,060
you're a traffic police,

712
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,100
we're very surprise.

713
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,030
What

714
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:50,580
made you

715
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,620
to develop the game,

716
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,620
Auto Chess Battle?

717
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,050
What game?

718
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,380
Auto Chess Battle.

719
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,280
I've never heard of it.

720
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,410
You must be mistaken.

721
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,920
Are you Pei Donglai?

722
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:01,630
Yes.

723
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,420
We got the information

724
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,060
from the game introduction.

725
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,110
You are the contact

726
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,500
for this game.

727
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:07,060
Yes.

728
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:09,870
What game are you talking about?

729
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,330
What's going on?

730
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,950
Auto Chess Battle

731
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,430
saw surging downloads

732
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:14,370
in one month.

733
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,190
Especially after

734
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,490
English updates were patched,

735
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,300
it's becoming popular worldwide.

736
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,210
It's hard to imagine

737
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,620
such a miraculous game

738
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,090
was produced by

739
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,010
a traffic police.

740
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,250
What kind of story

741
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:25,250
is behind this?

742
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:25,910
Mr. Pei,

743
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,870
can you say something

744
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:27,620
to the audience?

745
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,340
Wait... wait a minute.

746
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,310
I need to go back

747
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,740
to confirm something.

748
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,390
Just say something.

749
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,180
Just say something.

750
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,670
No comment.

751
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,820
Mr. Pei. Mr. Pei.

752
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,100
Dad, mom.

753
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,540
Tell us.

754
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,090
What's going on?

755
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,710
I made a game. It became popular.

756
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:51,590
You made it yourself?

757
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,010
That's why you worked with computer

758
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,820
in your room all day?

759
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:56,380
Yes.

760
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,820
Did it affect your school course?

761
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,590
What are you talking about?

762
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,310
Our son doesn't need

763
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:02,490
school classes now.

764
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:04,050
Dad,

765
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,120
I plan to set up a company.

766
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,460
I've talked to the game platform.

767
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,010
They'll provide funds.

768
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,400
I'll in charge of the products and technologies.

769
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:13,780
The main business

770
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,670
of the company focuses on

771
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,910
the operation of Auto Chess Battle,

772
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,020
and its follow-up development.

773
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,430
Son, you're awesome.

774
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,300
You're starting your business in high school.

775
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,390
But you'll take the college entrance exam next year.

776
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,590
It will affect your exam preparation.

777
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:26,620
I know.

778
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:28,440
I want dad to quit his job.

779
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:29,860
I'll have classes as usual.

780
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:30,580
Then you two

781
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,530
help me manage the company,

782
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,420
so that both sides won't be delayed.

783
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,250
Quit my job?

784
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,190
No way.

785
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,020
I don't know computer.

786
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:39,350
I'll take care of the technology.

787
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,150
And the platform

788
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,060
will offer some help.

789
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:42,530
You just need to manage it.

790
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:43,890
No, I can't.

791
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:45,670
What should I tell my leader?

792
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,970
I think it's good.

793
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,550
I asked you to change your job long ago.

794
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,390
You haven't done it

795
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,150
for so long.

796
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:50,820
Why don't you quit?

797
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:52,700
How much do they want to invest?

798
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:53,460
No matter how much they invest,

799
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:55,020
paid employment is more stable.

800
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:55,490
20 million.

801
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:56,940
What?

802
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,710
Page 18, Article 14.

803
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,810
About the deadline of the lease of server.

804
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:14,500
There's a problem

805
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:15,120
with this place.

806
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:19,530
I need a breath of fresh air.

807
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:27,450
Look at this one.

808
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,000
Pei Zhi,

809
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,060
I have confidence

810
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:35,210
in your ability.

811
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:36,900
But the business

812
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:38,170
needs professional management.

813
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,260
With all due respect,

814
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:40,990
your father doesn't seem to

815
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:41,960
know about our business.

816
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:42,720
Mr. Charlie.

817
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,790
It is my core request

818
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,470
that my father will

819
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,620
be the legal representative of the company.

820
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:49,500
Okay.

821
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,420
Just a personal reminder.

822
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,750
You can ignore it.

823
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:55,280
But if anything happens,

824
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,990
Steak will initiate

825
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:57,830
the termination of the contract

826
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:58,790
to avoid any risks.

827
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,180
I know.

828
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,020
Can we continue?

829
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:04,980
This place.

830
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,890
The date is not prescribed

831
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,510
accurately enough.

832
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,770
It might need some modification.

833
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:26,500
Dad.

834
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:28,580
Wake up.

835
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:31,550
Let's go home.

836
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:33,550
The discussion is over.

837
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,460
I need you to sign the contract.

838
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,020
It's all settled?

839
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,440
I really envy you

840
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:42,830
for having such an excellent son.

841
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,500
Look forward to working with you.

842
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,620
I'm looking forward too.

843
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,630
This way, please.

844
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:50,670
Let's go.

845
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:55,830
Hello, Pei Zhi.

846
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,550
I'm a reporter

847
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,600
from Anping TV Station.

848
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,620
I want to interview you.

849
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,510
Why did you think of

850
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,770
making this game?

851
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,300
Out of personal interest.

852
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:04,890
Have you ever thought that

853
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:05,910
Auto Chess Battle would be popular?

854
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,360
Pei Zhi is amazing.

855
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,730
There are reporters interviewing him.

856
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,620
You are very confident in yourself.

857
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,020
Because I had a dream.

858
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:16,100
I saw the future in my dream.

859
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:19,350
What was your idea

860
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,670
for this game

861
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,300
in the first place?

862
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,340
My idea is simple.

863
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:26,760
Xiaomeng,

864
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,160
can I borrow your phone?

865
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:29,650
Lend me your phone.

866
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,320
What are you doing?

867
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,570
Don't get caught by teachers.

868
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,950
Since there are

869
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,500
[China's Zuckerberg! The Author of Auto Chess Battle is A High School Senior?]

870
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,310
chess games in life,

871
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:40,050
it's good to make it

872
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:40,930
into an automatic mode.

873
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,520
Launch it on the Internet,

874
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,830
so as to connect

875
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,280
different people worldwide.

876
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:49,450
They can have chess battles

877
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,640
with others on such a platform.

878
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:50,980
Come in.

879
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,350
We never

880
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,890
constrain Pei Zhi.

881
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,810
Because when it comes to geniuses,

882
00:40:59,260 --> 00:40:59,620
we need

883
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,060
a different way to educate them.

884
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,700
Our principle of education in Experimental High School

885
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,980
has always been teaching by their aptitudes.

886
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,500
The teachers actually did so.

887
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:10,910
Pei Zhi is a senior now.

888
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,670
Are you worried that

889
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,180
his business will affect his college entrance exam?

890
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,400
Mr. Xie.

891
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,100
I'm Pei Zhi's class teacher.

892
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:18,020
These are his test paper

893
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,270
of various subjects

894
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,380
in the last exam.

895
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,380
The total score is 715.

896
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,810
We're never worried about

897
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:27,620
students like him.

898
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:28,820
What we should do

899
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:30,650
is to give the right guidance

900
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,890
in mind, in thoughts.

901
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,890
We hope he cherishes his talent,

902
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:36,220
so that he can serve the country

903
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,220
and the society.

904
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,120
Give it a close-up.

905
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:42,770
Principal, please make way.

906
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,420
You've blocked the light.

907
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:57,860
Auto Chess Battle?

908
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,550
You copied the idea

909
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,660
of that chess game in Strawberry World.

910
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:02,420
You've played it too?

911
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,790
CEO of Donglai Network

912
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,000
Technology Development Company,

913
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:06,740
Pei Donglai.

914
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:08,510
Your father resigned?

915
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:10,310
Yes.

916
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,540
Is that your purpose?

917
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,770
To make him leave the traffic police force.

918
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:15,950
Stop being a traffic police officer.

919
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,100
No longer deal with any car accident.

920
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,590
Then, whether that accident happens

921
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,420
or not,

922
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,460
the recording won't reappear.

923
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,500
My efforts become meaningless.

924
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:26,780
You're right.

925
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,780
Pei Zhi, you're handling it with a drastic measure.

926
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:31,870
Are you going to cut off

927
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:32,810
my way home?

928
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:34,480
I thought,

929
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,070
though I said we are enemies,

930
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,380
you may change your mind.

931
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:38,140
Now I think

932
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,180
I was too stupid.

933
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,440
Do you remember Yu Minghai?

934
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,220
The owner of Minghai Boxing Club.

935
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,710
His father and my father

936
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:56,530
are good friends.

937
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,380
But in Strawberry World,

938
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,130
his father died of liver cancer

939
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,150
in 2014.
