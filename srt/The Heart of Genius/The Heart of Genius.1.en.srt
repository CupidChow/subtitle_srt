What do you think?

00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:22,960
Get in.

8
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,630
No, no, no.

9
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,420
This is a new car.

10
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,180
I just got my license.

11
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,140
I'm afraid I will get it scraped by accident.

What are you afraid of?

You have me.

14
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:29,930
It's okay.

15
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:31,590
Just drive.

I'm Zhu.

00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:43,660
Thank you.

00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,250

00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,390
Bye, baby.

Can you drive faster?

26
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,530
When starting the car, put it in the second gear and speed it up.

27
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,390
Smoothly shift between different gears.

28
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,870
90% of car accidents can be attributed to speeding,

This is a car with automatic transmission,

Good for you.

36
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,460
Well,

38
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,740
I have a piece of paper in my bag.

Good for you.

44
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:54,460
You applied for internships,

45
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,090
prepared for classes,

46
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,500
had a blind date,

49
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,790

50

51

52

Have you really thought it through

53
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:12,930
and stopped looking for Pei Zhi?

54
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,269
Can you focus on driving?

55
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,300
Sorry.

56

Sorry, sir.

59
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,220
Sorry.

60
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,900
I was wrong.

61
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,860
I shouldn't have mentioned him.

When you brake,

68

it will turn off the engine.

This is Lin Zhaoxi.

77

She's the new intern teacher

78
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,290
of our school.

79
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,300
Take your time.

80
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,510
I'm going to the mall across the street.

81
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,860
Okay.

82
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,150
I ordered something.

83
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,520
Hope you'll like it.

84
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,500
Okay, thank you.

85
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,640
My aunt told me

86
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,360
you studied philosophy.

87
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,100
What a coincidence.

88
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,680
I know a lot

89
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,190
about philosophy.

90
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,280
Really?

91
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,260
Instead of defeating the ugliness,

92
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,270
we can choose beauty.

93
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,150
One's life can be small,

94
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:38,990
but his world must be wide.

95
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,390
Stubborn people go the farthest,

96
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,670
because they are not afraid of anything.

97
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,690
The only thing they are afraid of is not reaching the end.

98
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,250
These philosophical credings

99
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,560
guided me

100
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,540
in the first half of my life.

101
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,700
What you said

102
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,100
actually doesn't belong to philosophy.

103
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:55,780
What's the difference?

104
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,360
Can your teacher in the Philosophy Department

105
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,190
say something better

106
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,180
than this?

107
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,190
My aunt told me

108
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,160
you're a hardworking person.

109
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,750
I admire people like you the most.

110
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,200
Let me give you an example.

111
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,070
You know what?

112
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,420
When Einstein was little,

113
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,640
he was actually

114
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,140
a fool.

115
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,030
Let me tell you.

116
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,100
When he was in school,

117
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,230
he only got 1 point in math.

118
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:23,910
You see,

119
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,860
if a person can only get 1 point in math,

120
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,740
he must have a low IQ.

121
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,110
But through his own efforts,

122
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,030
he successfully

123
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:30,780
changed himself into a

124
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,110
a great scientist.

125
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:32,780
What is this?

126
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,820
The value and meaning of hard work.

127
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,430
My friend,

128
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,990
in Germany,

129
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,340
the lowest score of an exam is 6 points,

130
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,210
and the highest score is 1, so...

131
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,790
Is he from Germany?

132
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:45,840
No.

133
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,520
Why do I remember...

[2018.8.12, July 2nd in lunar calendar]

135

Dad.

136
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,540
Why are you sitting here?

137
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,580
You forgot your key?

138
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,270
What did you do today?

139
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:42,400
I was training myself to drive the car.

140
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,460
And then?

141
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,640
Just went home.

142
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,840
Let's go. I'm tired.

143
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,900
Are you tired of blind dates?

144
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,440
I saw it.

145
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,570
Let's have a chat.

146
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:03,670
How do you feel?

147
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,970
What do you mean?

148
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:05,910
Your date, how is he?

149
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,280
He's not good for me.

150
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,100
Then why did you go?

151
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,820
I didn't know at first.

152
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,180
He's a relative of the director

153
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,580
of the Academic Affair Office in my internship school.

154
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,630
I can't refuse it.

155
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,090
Lin Zhaoxi,

156
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,050
what are you thinking?

157
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,400
What am I thinking?

158
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,020
After graduation,

159
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,220
I should start dating.

160
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,810
What's your life plan?

161
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,100
To be a teacher.

162
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,680
Are you going to have the blind date

163
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,669
because you want to get married?

164
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,440
You want to become a teacher because you like teaching?

165
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,580
My dear old Lin,

166
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,750
I think you should know it

167
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,780
better than anyone else.

168
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:42,429
People don't necessarily do

169
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,539
what they like.

170
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,700
You loved math so much,

171
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,990
but you gave up the chance to study abroad

172
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,370
to raise me.

173
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,760
But I didn't give up math.

174
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,020
To put it bluntly, dad,

175
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,440
You're only an accountant of Yi Zhong High School,

176
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,270
and people do not consider that as a formal scientist.

177
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,820
That's not what I meant.

178
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,910
I know you bought the textbook

179
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,940
for math major's postgraduate entrance exam.

180
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,150
Why didn't you take the exam?

181
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,810
Can we just be realistic?

182
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,860
In order to pass the exam,

183
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,930
I should study for four years,

184
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,650
like those math major students.

185
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,120
I don't think four years are too long.

186
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,340
Isn't it long?

187
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,620
I'm tired. Let's go.

188
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,170
Has Pei Zhi graduated?

189
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:36,870
Has he returned to China?

190
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:37,450
I don't know.

191
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,000
You like him, don't you?

192
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,340
He went to Germany for study

193
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,530
without saying anything.

194
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,870
I haven't heard from him for four years.

195
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,860
Why do I like him?

196
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,060
Back then, didn't you say

197
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,000
you want to go abroad and find him?

198
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,130
But I give up now.

199
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,550
I've grown up.

200
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,610
Nothing is difficult in the world,

201
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,520
as long as you give up.

202
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,180
Is this growth?

203
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,990
Growing up is learning to compromise.

204
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:53,990
Why did you give up

205
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:54,860
at such a young age?

206
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,400
If you love someone, you can pursue him.

207
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,620
If you have a dream, you can go for it.

208
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,860
Do you think the distance between you

209
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,550
and passing the post graduate exam for math major,

210
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,590
the distance between you and Pei Zhi,

211
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,980
are further than the distance between

212
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,260
pythagoras theorem and the P NP problem?

213
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:04,820
That's enough, Dad.

214
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,130
I've been lectured enough today.

215
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:06,810
My hiccups

216
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,520
smell like those cliches he said.

217
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,510
Really, I don't want to hear about it anymore.

218
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,050
Who is it?

219
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,210
August 12, 2018.

220
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,220
Lin Zhaoxi,

221
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,270
Hello.

222
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,480
We'll meet soon.

223
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,700
You had a big head when you were young.

224
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,120
You think my head was big?

225
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:31,890
Isn't it big?

226
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,830
What's wrong with a big head?

227
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,340
It's good.

228
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,200
So cute.

229
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,000
What about your photo when you were young?

230
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:39,980
What?

231
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,220
Didn't we agree?

232
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,540
Agree on what?

233
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:44,460
Well...

234
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,840
Are you trying to trick me?

235
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,550
[Director Gao]

236
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,070
Hello, Director.

237
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,470
Lin, are you free tonight?

238
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,340
What can I do for you?

239
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,710
My nephew praised you.

240
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,830
He said you're a polite and innocent girl.

241
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,670
He wants to ask you out for movie tonight.

242
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,610
Please go and meet him at the department store

243
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,650
at 7:00 p.m. today.

244
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,500
Director.

245
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,020
I...

246
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,090
We may not be suitable for each other.

247
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,510
Lin, I know your family

248
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,010
is not wealthy

249
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,830
and your appearance isn't pretty either.

250
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,810
But don't feel inferior.

251
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,230
You graduated from a prestigious school.

252
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,200
Our family values this.

253
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,590
You have a chance.

254
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,860
You may have misunderstood me.

255
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,020
I didn't mean that.

256
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,140
Damn.

257
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:56,840
Lin Zhaoxi!

258
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,180
Are you scolding me?

259
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,260
No, Director.

260
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,010
I didn't scold you.

261
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:02,750
No, I...

262
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,500
How did you drive?

263
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,100
I'm sorry

264
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,730
Lin Zhaoxi!

265
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,460
I...

266
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,240
Would you please wait for a minute?

267
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,280
I'll go to...

268
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,070
I'll call you later.

269
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,850
What's wrong with you?

270
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:11,380
Well...

271
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,240
I didn't even move my car.

272
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:12,940
I'm sorry.

273
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,740
It's my responsibility, and I'll pay for it.

274
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,630
Ji Jiang, the reporters are coming.

275
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,660
Hurry up. Stop taking pictures.

276
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,900
Get in the car.

277
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,860
What do you mean?

278
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,530
Why did you get in my car?

279
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,790
You bumped my car.

280
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,300
Listen...

281
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:24,820
Can you drive?

282
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,180
Hold on.

283
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,350
You have to make it clear.

284
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,340
Why did you get in my car?

285
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,020
I...

286
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:28,700
Who are you?

287
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:30,700
It's me!

288
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,340
You don't know me?

289
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,970
Look at that!

290
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:36,650
Look.

291
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,370
I am him. He is me.

292
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,480
Ji... Ji Jiang?

293
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:45,330
Can you drive now?

294
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,480
We are alumni.

295
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,250
Just drive.

296
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,310
I'm begging you. Hurry up.

297
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:50,740
Oh no.

298
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,610
Hurry up.

299
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,940
Cover your face.

300
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,540
Step on the clutch and the gas.

301
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,270
Lu, the car is on Baihua Road.

302
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,300
I'll leave the rest to you.

303
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,420
I always have to clean up the mess for you.

304
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,540
I'm not your dad.

305
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,200
Didn't I tell you

306
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,670
not to go to the hotel?

307
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,300
Tell me.

308
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,660
Why did you come to the hotel for the rehearsal?

309
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,730
Why did you take me to that hotel?

310
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,750
I'm not so sure about the performance,

311
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,230
and I want to rehearse.

312
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,550
Can't we rehearse in the company?

313
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,170
I asked you, and you agreed!

314
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,220
You're blaming me now?

315
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,910
Who else should I blame?

316
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,540
Then explain it to others.

317
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:39,980
Stop the car.

318
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:48,860
Well,

319
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,270
you got to pay me for repairing the car before you leave.

320
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:51,980
Drive.

321
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,870
I won't pay you the money if you don't drive now.

322
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,110
Ji Jiang!

323
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:57,930
Drive!

324
00:14:59,260 --> 00:14:59,900
Ji Jiang!

325
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,340
Drive!

326
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,100
Ji Jiang!

327
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,890
Scum!

328
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,530
Leave me your contact information

329
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,380
and home address.

330
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,430
I'll compensate you

331
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,260
when the damage of the car is determined.

332
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,400
I borrowed this car.

333
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:32,950
Would you mind

334
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,020
contacting the owner directly?

335
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,680
Stop over there.

336
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,300
I don't want to contact anyone else.

337
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,040
I only recognize you.

338
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,260
Wait.

339
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,610
Phone, address, and name.

340
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:01,780
Here.

341
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,550
The damage of your car is not serious.

342
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,540
It will only cost 300 yuan to repair it.

343
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,640
I'll give you 1,000.

344
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,350
You may keep the rest of the money.

345
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,290
Thank you for taking me away from them.

346
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,540
Then why do you need

347
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,380
my phone number and address?

348
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,990
Our conversation in the car today

349
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,840
is my privacy.

350
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:15,840
Now I know who you are

351
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,510
and where you live.

352
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,620
If you spread rumors

353
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:18,350
on the Internet,

354
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,460
I'll contact my lawyer and sue you.

355
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,620
That's hilarious.

356
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,380
Ridiculous.

357
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,260
Why are you so late?

358
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,340
Don't mention it.

359
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,280
Where are you going?

360
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,520
I'm going to the office.

361
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,460
I left the meal on your table.

362
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,620
Why are you going to work at this late hour?

363
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,680
I'll be back soon.

364
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,540
Did you take the key?

365
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,110
Yes.

366
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,600
Dad.

367
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:24,820
Hello?

368
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:26,290
Hello.

369
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,100
We can't predict

370
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,310
when the patient will wake up.

371
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:36,600
Okay then. Later,

372
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,580
when the family members come, I'll send them to you.

373
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:38,330
Dad!

374
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,300
Dad!

375
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:40,700
Dad!

376
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,500
Are you Lin Zhaosheng's family member?

377
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,560
Yes, I'm his daughter.

378
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,000
How is he now?

379
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,120
The patient's head was severely hit.

380
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:49,220
We have sutured

381
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,090
the wound.

382
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,180
The skull has not sustained obvious damage.

383
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,230
Judging from the current situation,

384
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:56,890
he might have concussion.

385
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,850
He'll be in a coma for a while.

386
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,530
Thank you.

387
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,940
He was fine last night.

388
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,760
Why did he suddenly...

389
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,660
Calm down.

390
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:09,500
Here's the thing.

391
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,420
At 6 a.m. this morning,

392
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,900
your dad was found by his student,

393
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,220
he was lying in the school finance office.

394
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,980
The finance office lost 170,000 yuan.

395
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:16,620
According to

396
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,100
our investigation, last night,

397
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,740
your dad's colleague

398
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,240
called him

399
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,620
to go to the school finance office

400
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,420
to close the windows.

401
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,070
During this process,

402
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,800
someone followed him and attacked him,

403
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:27,800
and took the money.

404
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,360
Hello, Xiaomeng.

405
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,230
Something happened to my dad.

406
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,190
Can you come to the hospital

407
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,040
and take care of him?

408
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,890
What's wrong with Uncle Lin?

409
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,390
I can't explain...

410
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,620
I can't explain it now.

411
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,860
But I need to go home and withdraw some money.

412
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:40,930
OK?

413
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,070
Take care of him for me.

414
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,740
He's in

415
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,390
Room 916

416
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,140
of Renming Eryuan Hospital's inpatient department.

417
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:46,750
Okay.

418
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,080
Thank you.

419
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,890
January 5, 1998.

420
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,810
Xi was 3 years old.

421
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,680
May 2001.

422
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,740
Xi was 5.5 years old.

423
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:26,680
She got a souvenir toy

424
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,800
at a fast food restaurant.

425
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,500
December 2001,

426
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,120
took Xi to Beijing.

427
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,910
In 2002,

428
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,390
he location is safe and stable.

429
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,990
I went for a walk with Xi.

430
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,050
July 8, 2017.

431
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,420
Xi graduated from her university with her bachelor's degree.

432
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,780
She's going to work.

433
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,090
The school lost money,

434
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,150
we have shown enough kindness that

435
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,300
we didn't ask your dad to take the responsibility.

436
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,320
But the medical expenses should be

437
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,670
paid by yourself.

438
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,420
But what did my dad do wrong?

439
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,630
He didn't tell us his disease,

440
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,170
and this affected his work.

441
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:58,970
He was careless.

442
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,420
Think about it.

443
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,160
He even forgot to close the window

444
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,380
of the finance office.

445
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,910
Of course something will happen.

446
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,840
What's his disease?

447
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:08,140
Your dad has

448
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,140
Alzheimer's disease,

449
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,620
which means senile dementia.

450
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,720
As a financial staff,

451
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,820
he didn't report his disease

452
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,140
to the school immediately,

453
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,270
this has already violated

454
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,420
the regulations of the finance office.

455
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,560
He's only 45 years old.

456
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,930
He can't have Alzheimer's disease.

457
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,060
Yeah, I know.

458
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,420
We didn't know this

459
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,500
until we came to visit him

460
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,630
this morning.

461
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,520
He really kept us in the dark

462
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,470
for too long.

463
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,290
As for the details,

464
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,020
you should ask the doctor.

465
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,580
Didn't your dad tell you?

466
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:37,790
He has been receiving treatment here

467
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,170
for five years.

468
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,630
Xiaomeng,

469
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,780
can you answer it for me?

470
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,400
Okay.

471
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,200
In the last few months,

472
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,930
his situation is deteriorating.

473
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,110
It's hard to predict

474
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,530
how this accident will

475
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,940
affect him.

476
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:55,990
I can't tell

477
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,380
when he will wake up.

478
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:59,740
You need to be mentally prepared.

479
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:19,790
Xi.

480
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,710
Go back.

481
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,130
I'll keep an eye on him tonight.

482
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,270
You've been staying up for so long.

483
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,660
Listen to me.

484
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,010
Take a shower

485
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,000
and have a good sleep.

486
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,690
If you fall ill,

487
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,530
who will take care of your dad?

488
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:32,540
Dad.

489
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:34,530
I got 100 marks

490
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,310
in math test yesterday.

491
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:36,750
Do you think I can

492
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,700
be as good as you?

493
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,220
Of course.

494
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,220
You are my daughter.

495
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:41,780
It's said that

496
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,260
you are better than me.

497
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,570
You'll surpass me soon.

498
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,490
When is it?

499
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:49,960
Come here.

500
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,070
Here

501
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,380
is the problem you are learning.

502
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,330
And below it, this is the problem I'm working on.

503
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,420
When you can understand

504
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,410
the difficult problem I'm working on,

505
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,270
you'll surpass me.

506
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:31,220
Okay, I'll study hard.

507
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,330
When I grow up, I'll help you solve the problem.

508
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,540
Pinky swear.

509
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,250
We had the pinky swear here,

510
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,660
and it will never change.

511
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:41,590
I've passed.

512
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:42,390
Me too.

513
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,680

At that time,

685
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,190
she was in a baby's cart,

686
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,310
and covered with a white paper.

687
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:35,170
Her name Lin Zhaoxi was written on that paper.

688
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,100
Her biological parents are unknown.

689
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,400
What happened?

690
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:49,429
This is the photo

691
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:51,070
of Zhang Shuping’s training camp.

692
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:52,330
I participated in it myself.

693
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:54,330
Look, this is me.

694
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,650
Zhang Shuping, Pei Zhi.

695
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,580
Who are they?

696
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,410
Something is wrong with your photo.

697
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,330
Ji Jiang?

698
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,430
Is it related to him?

699
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,590
The director asked me to bring you some food.

700
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,250
Which city will the 24th Winter Olympic

701
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,460
be held in?

702
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,430
Beijing.

703
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,680
We’re friends.

704
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,520
I’m Ji Jiang.

705
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,310
Are you really Ji Jiang?

706
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,890
Yes, I am Ji Jiang.

707
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,610
Did you do it?

708
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,050
What did I do?

709
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,450
Did you bring me here?

710
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,510
What's your purpose?

711
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,880
It wasn't me. I even wanted to ask you.

712
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,140
We turned into children

713
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,710
in front of your house.

714
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,550
You should

715
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,450
explain it to me.

716
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,330
I'm the victim.

717
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,850
Why should I explain to you?

718
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,580
I'm the victim.

719
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:11,840
I went to your house

720
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,190
just because I need you to prove it to me.

721
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,000
In the end,

722
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:15,710
I went back to the past.

723
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,930
Do you think things were easy for

724
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:19,130
an orphan like me?

725
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,470
In the future, I'll have to experience

726
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,780
what I've suffered again.

727
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,370
Were you an orphan?

728
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,180
Yes.

729
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,230
You grew up in this orphanage?

730
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,260
Yes.

731
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,390
I didn't see you

732
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:31,180
in these files.

733
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,020
This is my file.

734
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,750
Dang Aimin.

735
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:48,280
[File Box]

736
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,120
When I was little, my name was Hua Juan.

737
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,560
I didn't change my name to Ji Jiang

738
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,230
until I was adopted

739
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,220
by my parents.

740
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,040
I...

741
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,270
Well...

742
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,960
even if I went back to 2006,

743
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,180
I shouldn't be in

744
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,180
this orphanage.

745
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,430
You know what? I have a home.

746
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,020
I grew up

747
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:21,620
with my dad.

748
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,760
Why am I here?

749
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,180
I'm also confused.

750
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:25,020
When I first came here,

751
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,370
I thought I was dreaming.

752
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,650
So I looked around.

753
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:28,480
I found everything here

754
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,270
is the same

755
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:29,830
with that in my memory.

756
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,060
Except for two things,

757
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:31,980
one is you.

758
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,370
I don't remember you, Lin Zhaoxi,

759
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,550
lived in our orphanage.

760
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,090
Because I'm not an orphan.

761
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,550
And the other is I found this photo

762
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,380
on me.

763
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,260
It really wasn't you.

764
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,630
How many times have I told you?

765
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,770
It really wasn't me.

766
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,040
If you keep talking,

767
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,100
I'll suspect you did it.

768
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:04,420
Then we can never get out of this.

769
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,340
I'm sorry.

770
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,580
And do you think

771
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,820
a human can make all this happen?

772
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,150
I just wonder

773
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,210
why would this photo went back to the past

774
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,110
with you?

775
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,170
It's so weird.

776
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:16,550
How would I know?

777
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,630
Isn't this yours?

778
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:18,820
I've never seen it before.

779
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,460
I went home this afternoon,

780
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,470
I opened my mailbox,

781
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,420
and saw this photo.

782
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,050
This is it.

783
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,180
I don't know who put it there.

784
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,370
I thought it was my dad.

785
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,190
But now it turns out that

786
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,100
he didn't.

787
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,650
Anyway,

788
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,850
this photo traveled through time

789
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,610
with us.

790
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,860
Isn't it a bit ridiculous?

791
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,090
I saw the photo,

792
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,610
and then you came to me.

793
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,740
Then I wiped the formula.

794
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,220
Wipe it?

795
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,050
Is it because of the formula?

796
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,330
Who knows?

797
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,530
I saw you

798
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,360
you were crying.

799
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:55,430
Then I comforted you.

800
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:56,560
I didn't do anything else.

801
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,340
This photo has nothing to do with me anyway.

802
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,840
You're in the photo.

803
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,430
Dang Aimin.

804
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,180
Why not?

805
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,430
I attended

806
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,350
Zhang Shuping’s training camp.

807
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,560
But we didn't win the gold medal

808
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,020
in the Math Olympic competition.

809
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,220
Look at Pei Zhi.

810
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,510
He quarreled with Zhang Shuping

811
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,500
shortly after he got into the training camp.

812
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,420
He left there after that.

813
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,300
He didn’t stay there

814
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:17,900
to participate in the competition.

815
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,180
Why was he in the photo?

816
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,690
You know Pei Zhi?

817
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,250
We were in the same grade.

818
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:24,800
But I don't know him well.

819
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:25,800
He doesn't fit in.

820
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:30,850
The winners...

821
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,760
The winners of the gold medal are

822
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,720
Zhang Liang, Pei Zhi, me,

823
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:39,900
him, Liu Xu, and Lu Zhihao.

824
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:42,710
But the problem is I've never

825
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,780
participated in this training camp.

826
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,270
And neither did I participated in this competition.

827
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:45,950
Also, my dad.

828
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:46,670
Why is he

829
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,010
in this photo?

830
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,270
What is the reason

831
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,290
for all this?

832
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:54,380
The photo?

833
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,500
The formula?

834
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,870
What else can it be?

835
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,460
I think

836
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:08,580
we shouldn't think about

837
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,680
how we got here.

838
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,830
Let's think about how to go back.

839
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,120
Do you think we can go back?

840
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:29,290
Why are you two

841
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,360
still here?

842
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,750
It's late.

843
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:32,800
Why don't you go to bed?

844
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,310
Mrs. Li, we're leaving now.

845
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,500
Lin Zhaoxi, don't lie again.

846
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,650
I'm sorry, Mrs. Li.

847
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:45,100
I know I was wrong.

848
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,160
Get some rest.

849
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,340
Here.

850
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:00,820
I got your information.

851
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,150
You live in Room 303.

852
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,730
The lower bunk on the right side of the door.

853
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,820
Why are you sneaking around?

854
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,720
Don't you think it's exciting?

855
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,060
What's so exciting?

856
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,520
The whole world doesn't know

857
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,390
our secret.

858
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,830
This experience is so important.

859
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,550
As an actor,

860
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,100
I need to feel it.

861
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,780
Like a spy drama.

862
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:19,600
Remember,

863
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,860
don't expose

864
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:21,820
our identities.

00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,170
[Textbook for Elementary School Mathematic Olympic Competition]

866
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,170
[Draw inferences about other cases from one instance]

867
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,060
I hope this is all a dream.

868
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:58,490
After I wake up,

869
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,600
everything will go back to normal.

870
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:11,090
Lin Zhaoxi! Lin Zhaoxi!

871
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:13,130
You're awake.

872
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,220
It's just a dream.

873
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:16,380
I must be dreaming.

874
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,580
What dream?

875
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,390
Get up and go to school.

876
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,560
Get up.

877
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,720
I've asked around.

878
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:22,790
We went to Hongxing Elementary School.

879
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,780
Class 2, Grade 5.

880
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:24,800
Come here.

881
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:25,800
Brush your teeth.

882
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,040
Or it'll be too late.

883
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,850
How can I go to school?

884
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,550
I'm an adult.

885
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:32,670
Why would I go to primary school?

886
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,180
Stop.

887
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:35,610
Why don't you shout louder?

888
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,840
Go shout on the street.

889
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:38,380
I'm an adult!

890
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,990
I'm from 2018!

891
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,140
Let's see whether Mrs. Li

892
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,160
will lock you up for a few more days

893
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,530
or send you to a psychiatrist?
