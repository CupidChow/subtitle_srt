00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,970
then obviously,

176

the data of the west was unreliable,

00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,040
with low credibility.

181
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,240
will have higher values.

182
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,880
Based on historical data

183
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,780
and certain routes,

184
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,740
each grid is given

185
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,620
a different prior probability.

186
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,130
Then according to

187
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,260
emergencies and time sequence,

188
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,260
update the posterior probability P

189

with real-time data

190
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,320

Right.

By repeating Bayes' theorem.

194
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,010
As the remaining distance

195

is shorter and shorter,

196
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,720
we can get one grid

197
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,940
with the highest probability

198
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:00,790

201

caused by subjective judgment.

202
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,130
We can consider

00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,860
all the locations

204
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,060
where the suspect may appear

at every point in time.

206
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,540
And form a probability distribution

207
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,580
on which each value

208
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,710
will be constantly updated.

209
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,490

in such a short time.

This is the magic of dreaming.

Did the dream have a cheese taste?

223
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,790
See? Do you understand?

224

I don't understand.

225
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,020
Then play chess if you don't understand.

What? You're in a competition?

236
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,780
When will you come back?

237

Maybe the day after tomorrow.

517
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:38,690
[The bell rings in 9 minutes.]

518
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:12,950
When you came to

519
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,140
the Cheese World,

520
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,630
I was

521
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,800
as you are now.

522
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,160
I could only see

523
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,690
and hear.

524
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,580
I had to watch you

525
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,400
come with her

526
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,060
and leave together.

527
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,620
I couldn't do anything.

528
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,090
In this world,

529
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:35,930
there're you, me

530
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,790
and Lin.

531
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,310
My dad didn't die.

532
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,410
Your dad didn't have an accident.

533
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,630
He didn't have Alzheimer's, either.

534
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,900
We could go to college together

535
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,410
and study math together.

536
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,610
We could change

537
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,700
Lin's fate together.

538
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,860
Your biggest confusion now

539
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,950
should be

540
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,610
why did I come

541
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,560
into this world.

542
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,980
I agree with what you said.

543
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,060
A person's experience

544
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,320
determines who he is.

545
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,580
So even if we

546
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,040
have the same genes,

547
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,330
we are still

548
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,470
different individuals.

549
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:20,330
She's the same.

550
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,660
Lin Zhaoxi.

551
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,430
The first time I saw her

552
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,580
was in the Cheese world.

553
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,360
It was the summer in 2006.

554
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,740
It really feels good.

555
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:42,390
Why are you wearing a cartoon T-shirt?

556
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,190
You like cartoons?

557
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,460
No, it can make me look younger.

558
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:47,730
Thank you.

559
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,820
My little hero.

560
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,590
Pei Zhi, are we friends?

561
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:53,710
Of course.

562
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:54,910
Good friends?

563
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:55,530
Best friends.

564
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,780
Lin Zhaoxi.

565
00:26:58,210 --> 00:26:59,580
I will help you and Hua Juan

566
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,460
go back home.

567
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:01,950
I'm a man of my word.

568
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:07,850
In this world,

569
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,700
there will be another Lin Zhaoxi.

570
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,090
A real me

571
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,230
in this world.

572
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,500
Take care of her for me.

573
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,980
I will. I promise.

574
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,620
In the years

575
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,640
since she left the Cheese World,

576
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,880
I could never forget that day.

577
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,070
I once tried to

578
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,100
transfer my feelings for her

579
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,240
to Cheese Lin Zhaoxi.

580
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,520
But I failed.

581
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,760
I started to realize that you were right.

582
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,150
Because of different experiences,

583
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,500
Lin Zhaoxi in this world

584
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,040
is totally different from

585
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,580
her in the Cheese World.

586
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:00,610
The person I miss

587
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,520
is in the distant parallel world.

588
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,370
She's here.

589
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,130
Thus I tried so hard

590
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,300
and came up with countless ways.

591
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,240
I finally made it here.

592
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,370
This is why

593
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,340
I should come to this world.

594
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,630
Because of her.

595
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:31,810
Because of Lin Zhaoxi.

596
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,180
In order to come to this world,

597
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,060
I've even given up

598
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,380
my own world.

599
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:38,740
Pei Zhi,

600
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,090
don't you want to

601
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,190
live with dad?

602
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,580
I have a way to send you

603
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,640
to the Cheese World.

604
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,620
And don't worry.

605
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:49,460
Before I came here,

606
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,920
I already talked it over with dad.

607
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,570
You can travel there without worry.

608
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,710
Don't worry about anything.

609
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,050
Live with him

610
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,140
Strawberry Pei Zhi.

611
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,870
Let's exchange our lives.

612
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,240
You're right.

613
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,460
Deep self-hypnosis

614
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,920
will change our positions.

615
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,580
I need your answer.

616
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:22,870
Next,

617
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,220
I'll hypnotize myself.

618
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,270
When the Newton's cradle in front of you

619
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,430
forms a wave of oscillation,

620
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,480
I will be hypnotized.

621
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:38,060
You can be free

622
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,060
for the time being.

623
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,090
But when the alarm

624
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,030
goes off,

625
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,020
I will wake up again

626
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,120
and control the body.

627
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,020
Let's start.

628
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,820
I disagree.

629
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,030
I disagree.

630
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,590
Did you hear that?

631
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,340
I'm going to tell

632
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,120
Lin Zhaoxi

633
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,010
everything.

634
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,050
I'll show her everything.

635
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:40,050
Guang, change it.

636
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,090
Pay attention to the one behind.

637
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,980
[Disconnected]

638
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,940
Share my findings

639
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,080
in the Cheese World.

640
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,360
The origin

641
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,410
is this letter.

642
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,080
There is a bloodstain on it.

643
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,030
It should be three stains.

644
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:07,460
[I love you, though I've only seen you once.]

645
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:07,460
[I want to stay with you but I have to leave.]

646
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:07,460
[I feel no regret you don't remember me.]

647
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,310
I think the other two

648
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:00,980
should be erased

649
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,350
by unknown power

650
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,500
during your two travels.

651
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,940
If you want to reach the Cheese World,

652
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,230
erase the last one stain.

653
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,740
Just like erasing the formula.

654
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,420
However,

655
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,140
since you can

656
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,360
watch this video,

657
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,820
it may mean you've rejected the idea

658
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,530
of living with dad

659
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,240
in the Cheese World.

660
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,780
It seems that you've

661
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,730
accepted his departure.

662
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:31,150
You've grown up.

663
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,160
But I'm determined to get what I want.

664
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,060
In the Cheese World,

665
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,660
I'm one of the best

666
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,800
mathematicians.

667
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,200
I proved P=NP.

668
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:50,730
The world of P=NP is beautiful.

669
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,630
Don't you want to have a look?

670
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,490
By the way,

671
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:05,020
my kindness to you

672
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,550
is reserved for one night.

673
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,949
If you disagree,

674
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:12,750
I will forever trap you

675
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,239
in this body.

676
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:21,699
Your threat

677
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:22,960
is useless to me.

678
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:26,699
Because I won't

679
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,719
go to the Cheese World.

680
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:32,780
On the surface, you're the one who controls everything.

681
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,719
But I will keep making you lose control.

682
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,580
I'm like a time bomb.

683
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:40,739
Sooner or later,

684
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,000
I'll break free from you.

685
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,560
Oh no.

686
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,500
You know what?

687
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,840
I've never been so grateful

688
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,080
for my mental illness.

689
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,250
With it,

690
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,860
I have a chance to turn the tide.

691
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:58,990
As I said,

692
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,070
different experiences

693
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,350
determine you and me.

694
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:14,530
As for the lock trapping you,

695
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:15,930
I can open it easily

696
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,430
with a steel wire.

697
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,830
It has nothing to do with intelligence.

698
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,060
I learned it

699
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:23,420
especially for this moment.

700
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,130
Those few minutes

701
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,220
were not enough for you

702
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,320
to break through this limit.

703
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:39,980
I guessed you might not agree.

704
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,850
Unfortunately, the real alarm I mentioned

705
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,410
is here.

706
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,420
I admit

707
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:01,740
I didn't expect

708
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,830
your mental condition.

709
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,820
This is a variable.

710
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:06,620
But if you want

711
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,660
to control your body.

712
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,720
That's absolutely impossible.

713
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:10,700
I'm sorry.

714
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,510
In one world,

715
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,820
there can only be one Pei Zhi.

716
00:37:56,330 --> 00:38:01,320
[Lin Zhaoxi]

717
00:37:56,330 --> 00:38:01,320
[Lin Zhaosheng]

718
00:37:56,330 --> 00:38:01,320
[Pei Zhi]

719
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,520
Water.

720
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,690
Thank you.

721
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,640
No one else is sleeping.

722
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,050
It's normal.

723
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,540
Mathematical Contest in Modeling.

724
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,620
48 hours are not enough for it.

725
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,980
There's no time for sleep.

726
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,990
Are you working so hard for the bonus?

727
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:32,700
Not exactly.

728
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,820
I think there should be

729
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,040
a more important reason.

730
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,420
The desire to win?

731
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,740
A sense of excitement.

732
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,080
It's kind of like

733
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:51,990
your excitement

734
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,340
when playing games.

735
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,810
Studying is actually

736
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,220
a very difficult path.

737
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,020
You have to devote

738
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,600
a lot of time

739
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:06,860
and energy.

740
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,060
But it doesn't

741
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,010
always get paid.

742
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,100
In the MCM,

743
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,600
you can use what you've learned

744
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,460
to complete the match

745
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,270
and see the results in a short time.

746
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,800
It's kind of like...

747
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,060
When we were in middle school,

748
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,450
a piece of math paper was handed out.

749
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:24,450
And there were

750
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,040
some scratch paper with you.

751
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,300
You started the exercise

752
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,060
from the first question

753
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,180
to the last question.

754
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,050
You answered all fluently.

755
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,700
I really miss it.

756
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,410
Maybe my feelings

757
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,490
was different from yours.

758
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,140
But it doesn't matter

759
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,660
as long as you're happy.

760
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,170
Don't stay up with me.

761
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:48,940
Go to sleep.

762
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:50,140
It's okay.

763
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,500
Don't worry about me. Go back to your work.

764
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:19,860
Now I understand

765
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,430
why I liked you so much.

766
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,450
I mean "liked".

767
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,380
You always bring

768
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,440
a positive feeling

769
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:35,820
to those around you.

770
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:37,820
When we were in the Cheese World,

771
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,750
you told me

772
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,700
you got your courage back.

773
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:42,860
I think what you got back

774
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,190
is the Halo of Courage.

775
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,420
All your friends

776
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,790
can share it.

777
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,400
You're exaggerating, Hua Juan.

778
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:04,140
If there's Hua Juan, why is there Pei Zhi?

779
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,190
-I'm going to sleep. -Pei Zhi.

780
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:09,490
Pei Zhi.

781
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,270
Hello.

782
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,340
I'm here.

783
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,740
Okay, I'll pick you up now.

784
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:16,910
Pei Zhi is here.

785
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:18,860
I'll pick him up.

786
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:25,940
[Lin Zhaoxi]

787
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:25,940
[Lin Zhaosheng]

788
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:25,940
[Pei Zhi]

789
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,070
We're here.

790
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:29,410
I see you.

791
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,010
Be careful.

792
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:56,870
I finally see you.

793
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:59,740
What's wrong?

794
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:07,480
How is your mother?

795
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:09,020
Not bad.

796
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,940
Didn't you say

797
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,140
you would come tomorrow morning?

798
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:12,850
Why are you here

799
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:13,710
in the middle of the night?

800
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:15,510
I missed you so much.

801
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,500
I couldn't wait until tomorrow.

802
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,310
We were just apart for one day.

803
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,880
Hua Juan is still here.

804
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:25,040
Sorry. I'll leave now.

805
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:26,940
Thank you.

806
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:29,630
Be careful.

807
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:35,750
Here.

808
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:40,350
Go back.

809
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:41,700
Thanks.

810
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,380
You're welcome. Bye.

811
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,300
See you.

812
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:55,940
Are you okay, Hua Juan?

813
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,160
Are you okay?

814
00:42:58,630 --> 00:42:59,630
I'm fine.

815
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:00,940
I'll take a rest here.

816
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,720
Wait for Lu to pick me up.
