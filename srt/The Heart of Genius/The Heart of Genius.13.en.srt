[Episode 13]

4
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:40,820
I think I've met you

5
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:41,770
in high school.

6
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,420
Stop pretending to be close to me.

7
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,910
You know my relationship with Ji Jiang.

8
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,890
I'll ask him to fire you.

9
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,850
If you're so intimate with him,

10
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,530
why do you need his derivatives?

11
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,200
Just ask Ji Jiang to

12
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:55,020
make one for you.

13
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,660
Who wants the derivatives?

14
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,110
I just want to check your identity.

15
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,450
You don't look like a good person.

16
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,700
What are you doing?

17
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,680
You studied in Experimental High School,

18
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,140
enrolled in 2010,

19
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:05,860
and you were in Class 13, right?

20
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:07,780
I was in Class 1.

21
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,180
Lu Zhihao.

22
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:16,990
Bao Xiaomeng.

23
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,340
Nice to meet you.

24
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:19,820
Nice to meet you.

25
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,170
♫ Ride on my beloved motorcycle ♫

26
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,620
♫ It'll never get stuck in heavy traffic ♫

27
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:30,170
So this is how

28
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,300
a superstar sings.

29
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,700
What's wrong with you?

30
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,540
Are you looking down on me?

31
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,579
No.

32
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,120
Why do I feel that you are happier

33
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,180
than me?

34
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,170
I'm happy to see you get beaten up.

35
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:40,780
Can't I?

36
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,380
Don't listen to him.

37
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,670
When you were fighting,

38
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,510
he cheered

39
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,780
even louder than me.

40
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,020
You must be tired.

41
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:49,700
Let me

42
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,620
turn on the air conditioner.

43
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,430
You two can take a break.

44
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:52,430
It's okay.

45
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,110
No need.

46
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,970
Pei Zhi, I'll send Xi home first.

47
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,510
Later,

48
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,500
I'll send you back to the boxing club.

49
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:01,860
Thank you.

50
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:02,860
You're welcome.

51
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,460
By the way,

52
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,910
I saw your mother

53
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,340
just now.

54
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,240
Yes, I saw her too.

55
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,510
The one

56
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,530
who cheered the whole audience up.

57
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,510
She shouted so excitingly

58
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,680
that I got goose bumps.

59
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,210
Did your mother watch your match

60
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,420
on the spot every time?

61
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,790
When I was an amateur,

62
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,740
she was there every time.

63
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,180
I didn't say hello

64
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:25,860
to her today.

65
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,160
Yes.

66
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,220
It's okay.

67
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,579
She always leaves

68
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,870
on her own

69
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,800
before I come down.

70
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:34,860
Why?

71
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,770
Maybe

72
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,020
she's afraid to see me hurt.

73
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,750
I think it's good.

74
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,440
I don't want to

75
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,500
see her

76
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,120
with a wound on my face

77
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,230
or when I'm bleeding.

78
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:48,730
It's not good.

79
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,820
That's right.

80
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,060
While I was watching,

81
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,470
I was worried too.

82
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,750
Your mother is quite tough.

83
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,650
Maybe it's because of my dad.

84
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,750
They knew each other

85
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,740
in a boxing match.

86
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,320
After they fell in love,

87
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,060
my mom would be on the spot

88
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:08,860
every time my dad played games.

89
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,750
But my dad

90
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,900
didn't want to worry my mom,

91
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,070
so he gave up boxing

92
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,060
for her.

93
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,500
What song do you want to hear?

94
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,750
Rap.

95
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,380
Rap?

96
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,210
I don't listen to rap songs.

97
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,150
Mainly because you sing happily

98
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:32,980
along the way.

99
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,620
You majored in medicine?

100
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:37,780
Yes.

101
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,159
I liked a girl

102
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,409
when working on my college application.

103
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,570
I secretly followed her on social media.

104
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,600
I saw her post saying

105
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,230
"I like Doctor so much."

106
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,260
So I applied for clinical medicine.

107
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,020
Later I found out

108
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,460
the "Doctor" she liked

109
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,659
is Eason Chen,

110
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,420
a singer.

111
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,100
It's true.

112
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,090
Are you free this weekend?

113
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,180
Yes.

114
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,660
Xi.

115
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,610
Xiaomeng, why are you...

116
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,060
I'm here to see you.

117
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,580
Why are you here?

118
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,660
I'm here for you.

119
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,120
You didn't tell me where you went.

120
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,050
Can't I even have

121
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,930
some personal freedom?

122
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,340
Let me introduce.

123
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,220
Lin Zhaoxi. Lu.

124
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,030
-Hello. -Hello.

125
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,610
He hasn't changed much.

126
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,230
I guess I don't need to introduce Pei.

127
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,880
Long time no see.

128
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,780
Long time no see.

129
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,770
What happened between you two?

130
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,640
We met at your door

131
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,730
and had a chat.

132
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,320
Pei Zhi just finished the game. He's tired.

133
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,100
I'll send him back first.

134
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,820
Xiaomeng, where are you going?

135
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:48,300
We could drive you there.

136
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,140
It's okay.

137
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:49,940
Xi.

138
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,600
Can I stay at your house tonight?

139
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,220
All right.

140
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,110
Bye.

141
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:54,900
Have a good rest.

142
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:56,010
I'm leaving.

143
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,190
Don't worry. Have a good rest.

144
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,100
Bye.

145
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:58,500
Bye.

146
00:05:59,070 --> 00:05:59,470
Bye.

147
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,500
Let's go.

148
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,930
Send Pei Zhi home now.

149
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,220
Let's have a private talk.

150
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:09,650
Okay.

151
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,800
Come on, Pei Zhi.

152
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:16,130
Thank you.

153
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,790
You're welcome.

154
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,390
Try the fresh tremella.

155
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,350
It tastes good.

156
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,690
What do you think of her?

157
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,220
I'm surprised.

158
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,400
Do you really think so?

159
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,659
Of course.

160
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,420
She gave me her number.

161
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,490
We have an appointment

162
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,310
for dinner this weekend.

163
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,640
Who are you talking about?

164
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,100
Bao Xiaomeng.

165
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,260
I am talking about Lin Zhaoxi,

166
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,040
not Bao Xiaomeng.

167
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,220
She...

168
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,900
I finally understand.

169
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,380
It's totally your wishful thinking.

170
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,100
She likes Pei Zhi.

171
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:10,910
I know.

172
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,260
Then why don'y you give up?

173
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,620
Silly.

174
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:14,340
Listen.

175
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,090
What you're doing now

176
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,260
will be in vain in the end.

177
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,180
I have to give it a try anyway.

178
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,180
The price is high.

179
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,460
You are devoting all your

180
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,390
time, energy, and money.

181
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,810
I think she's worth it.

182
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,220
Let me remind you.

183
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,420
You can't rest for too long.

184
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,510
If you keep resting,

185
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,470
the staff of the company

186
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,300
will be poor due to you.

187
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,220
Don't worry. I know what to do.

188
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,460
It won't take long.

189
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,590
Dear,

190
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,340
I haven't visited you

191
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,490
for a long time.

192
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,450
How dare you ignore me?

193
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,700
I'm very sad.

194
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,520
Your Majesty,

195
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,690
please don't be angry.

196
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,030
I'll come to you

197
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,670
after reading this page, okay?

198
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,400
It doesn't matter.

199
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,350
Let me finish.

200
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,020
It's almost done.

201
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,460
No.

202
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,610
I won't let you read it.

203
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,700
Bao Xiaomeng, are you a cat?

204
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,690
You're lying down like this.

205
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,190
No, I'm staying tonight

206
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,330
because I want to hear

207
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,850
some gossip.

208
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,470
-If you don't tell me, -Go away.

209
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:23,490
I would have lived here for nothing.

210
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,140
Go away.

211
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,070
No, tell me.

212
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,810
Don't disturb my study.

213
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,620
Tell me.

214
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,260
No.

215
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:27,700
Come here.

216
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,890
Tell me.

217
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,650
Tell me.

218
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:37,870
What?

219
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:40,500
What's going on between you and Ji Jiang?

220
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,919
Nothing.

221
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,510
Just friends.

222
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,010
How is that possible?

223
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,180
Can't you tell?

224
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,940
He has feelings for you.

225
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,030
Don't talk nonsense.

226
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,310
We're good friends.

227
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,570
The way he looks at you.

228
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,710
Even a fool knows that he likes you.

229
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,580
I've had eight relationships.

230
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,500
I promise

231
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,350
he definitely likes you.

232
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,460
No way.

233
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,610
He has so many beautiful girls around him.

234
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,240
What if?

235
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,320
What if?

236
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,340
What will you do?

237
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,020
He's a superstar.

238
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,810
He's rich and handsome.

239
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,670
Alright, stop it.

240
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,660
It's impossible for us.

241
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,700
Xi.

242
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,940
In school,

243
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,890
it's normal

244
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:30,930
to like someone with good scores.

245
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,060
But we've grown up.

246
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,290
Even if you think of the money,

247
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,380
you should learn to move on.

248
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,580
Stop. If you keep saying,

249
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,570
I'm going back to study.

250
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:40,740
-No. -I'm leaving.

251
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,060
Please don't be angry. I was wrong.

252
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,460
Let's turn off the lights and sleep.

253
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,450
Are you sure you will stop?

254
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,180
I will stop.

255
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,110
You swear?

256
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,000
Okay, go to bed.

257
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,750
You talk nonsense all day long.

258
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,230
I'm not.

259
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:57,780
Wait.

260
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,770
I haven't asked you.

261
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,390
Bao Xiaomeng.

262
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,020
Tell me.

263
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,350
What's going on between you and Lu Zhihao?

264
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,660
-I -What's going on? What's going on?

265
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,670
Nothing.

266
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:06,590
There's nothing

267
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,900
between us.

268
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,540
I...

269
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,610
I'm going to bed. I'm hanging up.

270
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,630
Are you asleep?

271
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,860
Be quiet, Bao Xiaomeng.

272
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,180
What are you looking at so early in the morning?

273
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,110
Sit down.

274
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,980
Didn't we agree that

275
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,440
you won't do math before I go back?

276
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,100
I just want to write something.

277
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,020
But I don't know what to write.

278
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,190
Then don't write.

279
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,620
Stop reading.

280
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:51,700
Morning, Mr. Lin.

281
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:52,940
Xi, I'm going to be late.

282
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,580
I'm leaving.

283
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,300
Okay.

284
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:54,540
Bye.

285
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,300
Bye. Bye.

286
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,060
Stop looking.

287
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,920
I'll get you something to eat.

288
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,770
Hello.

289
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,120
Yes.

290
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,360
Zhang Shuping wants to see me?

291
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:15,480
Sorry.

292
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,400
I didn't expect that.

293
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:19,790
Go there

294
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,410
at noon?

295
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,270
OK.

296
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,950
I'll go to Mr. Zhang at noon.

297
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,290
Okay, thank you.

298
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,700
Zhang Shuping wants to see you?

299
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,650
The same name, a girl.

300
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,760
The agent of the postgraduate training class.

301
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,170
She found a teacher for me

302
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,890
and asked me to check it out.

303
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,530
There's an agent for classes?

304
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:37,910
Well.

305
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,220
Times are changing.

306
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,610
I'm going out.

307
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,550
I'll be back soon.

308
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,260
Don't surf the Internet at home.

309
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:43,970
Got it?

310
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,650
Stop looking.

311
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,330
Stop looking. Sit down.

312
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,030
I'll make lunch for you.

313
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:48,960
Remember to eat it.

314
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:15,610
Hello.

315
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,520
I have an appointment with Mr. Zhang.

316
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:18,870
This way please.

317
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:19,390
Okay.

318
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,000
Thank you.

319
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:36,980
Principal.

320
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,140
Miss Lin is here.

321
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,460
OK.

322
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,420
Have a seat.

323
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,460
Thank you.

324
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,310
Wait a second.

325
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:44,710
Okay.

326
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,180
You want to see me?

327
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,590
To inform you

328
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:03,900
there is a vacancy

329
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,340
for math training class.

330
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,820
I've arranged for you.

331
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,920
You can join directly.

332
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,580
Didn't you say I'm not qualified?

333
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,130
I've read

334
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,750
your profile.

335
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,760
Your grades are good.

336
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,500
And I founded the school

337
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,470
to make money.

338
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,390
It's not bad

339
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,170
to have one more student.

340
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,140
Did you find out

341
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,800
who my dad is?

342
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:28,880
Who is your dad?

343
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,540
He's also an investor?

344
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,770
No, no, no.

345
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,750
Go to Mr. Fan to fill in the form and pay tuition fee.

346
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,070
You could have the class tomorrow.

347
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:38,940
Okay.

348
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:39,910
I'm leaving.

349
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,990
-Thank you. -Shuping.

350
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:41,900
Dad.

351
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:44,230
Dad.

352
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,380
Why are you here?

353
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:48,820
-You're really bad at lying. -Come here.

354
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,980
You look like this in your forties?

355
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:57,720
Sorry, Mr. Zhang.

356
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,310
You look quite handsome.

357
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,020
Sorry.

358
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,760
We know each other.

359
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:00,930
Let me say hello.

360
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,530
Wait.

361
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:03,700
Your...

362
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,010
Where is your long hair?

363
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,710
You cut it?

364
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,490
Your hair is not bad.

365
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,120
Your dad was bald in his thirties.

366
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,580
-Are you really his son? -Stop.

367
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,680
Lin, come home with me.

368
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:13,580
Come home with me. Come on.

369
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,240
-What? We're talking. -Come on.

370
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,040
I'm sorry. Let's go home.

371
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:17,820
This is my daughter.

372
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,510
Do we look alike?

373
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,850
How have you been?

374
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,250
Are you here to humiliate me?

375
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,530
What? What do you mean?

376
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,100
We're good friends.

377
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,660
Best friends.

378
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,720
Do you deal with everything

379
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,150
in your own way?

380
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,550
You don't deserve to be my friend.

381
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:41,760
Get out.

382
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,410
Let's go, dad.

383
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:50,210
Come with me.

384
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,880
Come, sit here.

385
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,590
How did you get here?

386
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:14,730
I followed you.

387
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,540
I just want to see

388
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,060
what Zhang Shuping has become.

389
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,220
Did I cause trouble?

390
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,100
No.

391
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:25,550
Sit here and wait for me.

392
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,150
I'll be right back.

393
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,800
I'm not going anywhere.

394
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,550
Okay, don't run around.

395
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,950
Don't be angry.

396
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,490
Why should I be mad at you?

397
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:35,910
Don't run around.

398
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,220
Mr. Zhang,

399
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,990
why did you say my dad

400
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,980
doesn't deserve to be your friend?

401
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,820
So you are Lin Zhaosheng's daughter.

402
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,200
You should learn something good at such a young age.

403
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,500
Don't always count on your relations.

404
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:58,290
Count on yourself.

405
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,740
I didn't count on my relations.

406
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:03,990
Go back and tell your boyfriend

407
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,090
I don't want his investment.

408
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,180
There are many training classes.

409
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,230
Go to another one.

410
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,230
What boyfriend? Investment?

411
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,220
Your...

412
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,340
Your actor boyfriend.

413
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,210
Ji Jiang?

414
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,530
His manager came to me.

415
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,830
He said he's willing to

416
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,620
to invest in my school.

417
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,990
The condition is to let you enroll.

418
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,380
Got it?

419
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,140
Okay, I got it.

420
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:27,950
Mr. Zhang,

421
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,820
you can say whatever you want to me.

422
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,020
But you can't say that to my dad.

423
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,920
I don't know what happened

424
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,890
between you two.

425
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,500
But he's sick now.

426
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:37,920
Alzheimer's disease.

427
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,150
He doesn't remember

428
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,370
what happened between you two.

429
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,820
He only knows that you are friends.

430
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,260
But don't worry.

431
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,120
We will never come here again.

432
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,780
Wait.

433
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,790
Dad, let's go home.

434
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:04,700
Let's go home.

435
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,140
Go home.

436
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,660
Stop looking.

437
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,070
What do you want?

438
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,690
Excuse me.

439
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,150
I saw there's a CCTV in front of your house.

440
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,310
Is this yours?

441
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,410
Yes.

442
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,400
My friend lives nearby.

443
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,390
She has a cat.

444
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,090
But the cat went missing recently.

445
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,380
Can you

446
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,540
let me watch the videos?

447
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,350
I'm looking for the cat.

448
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,860
I'm really sorry.

449
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:01,730
Because she keeps the cat

450
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,340
for a long time.

451
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,550
It's very important to her.

452
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,780
I'll finish it soon.

453
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,010
Okay.

454
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,890
By the way,

455
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,260
how long could

456
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,010
the video data be kept?

457
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,820
About 15 days.

458
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,420
It will be deleted if it takes longer.

459
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,780
That's enough.

460
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,990
Okay, come in.

461
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,850
Thank you.

462
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:19,770
It's OK.

463
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,190
Zhang Shuping and I...

464
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,640
I don't know much about you.

465
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,870
I always have a question.

466
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,540
But I didn't dare to ask.

467
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,110
Where is your mom?

468
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,300
Am I divorced?

469
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,540
What's her name?

470
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,940
Her name is Qiu Yue.

471
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,080
She passed away when she gave birth to me.

472
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:07,770
Dad.

473
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,850
No wonder...

474
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,020
Shuping...

475
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,490
I see.

476
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,190
What happened

477
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,490
between you three?

478
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,800
The three of us...

479
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,580
Shuping and I grew up together.

480
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,660
His long hair reached his shoulders.

481
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:40,960
We got into the Math Department

482
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,420
of Yongchuan University.

483
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,680
We and Qiu Yue

484
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,790
were in the same class.

485
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:52,750
But I quit.

486
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,850
I went to the Math Department of Sanwei University.

487
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,550
I can't remember what happened later.

488
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,180
How could I forget?

489
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,720
Dad, it's okay.

490
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,260
Forget it.

491
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,390
You came from the past.

492
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,110
It's normal that you don't know

493
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,220
things in the future.

494
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:16,940
Is that so?

495
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,380
Yes.

496
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,940
And you can't know

497
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,000
too much about the future.

498
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,470
If one day,

499
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,140
you go back

500
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,150
and change the past,

501
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:26,950
I'll disappear.

502
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,160
You don't want to lose me, do you?

503
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,060
No.

504
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,660
Then it's a deal.

505
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,840
Don't sneak out,

506
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:35,880
OK?

507
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,940
Just stay at home.

508
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,780
Leave Zhang Shuping

509
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,480
behind.

510
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,230
Forget about it.

511
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:43,720
Forget it.

512
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,430
Forget it.

513
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,290
Since this afternoon.

514
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,200
Please play it at 64 times speed.

515
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,740
64 times?

516
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,620
I'm an athlete with good eyesight.

517
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,230
An athlete? Okay.

518
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:05,790
Like this?

519
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,300
Stop.

520
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,620
Can you replay for four minutes?

521
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,000
Four minutes?

522
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:19,390
Yes.

523
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,410
Are you looking for the cat?

524
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,100
This is my friend.

525
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,420
When she was talking

526
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,120
with others,

527
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,210
the cat ran out of the room.

528
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,180
Please start from here

529
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,560
and play it at four times speed.

530
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,240
I want to check what happened later.

531
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:35,980
Okay.

532
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,020
Stop. Replay 28 seconds.

533
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:42,860
Turn back a little.

534
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,060
I found the cat.

535
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,100
Where is it?

536
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,690
Why can't I see it?

537
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,300
Thank you.

538
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,420
Where is it?

539
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,830
It's a parallel world.

540
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,050
Then things are logical.

541
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,130
In other words, in that world,

542
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,890
due to some deviations,

543
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,200
my dad survived

544
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,090
in 2009.

545
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,520
With the record in 2013...

546
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,020
But how could the recorder

547
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:31,580
and the photo

548
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,300
appear

549
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:32,910
in our world?

550
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,290
Actually,

551
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,510
I haven't figured it out.

552
00:23:58,930 --> 00:23:59,490
Pei Zhi.

553
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,130
Xi.

554
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,740
Master.

555
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,100
Why are you here?

556
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,340
I came to see Master and you.

557
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,420
You didn't come back.

558
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,620
So I waited here for a while.

559
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,000
Good.

560
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,530
I just learned a new game.

561
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:12,370
Play the game with me.

562
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:13,380
Okay, Master.

563
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,140
I remember there were two formulas

564
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,540
on that wall.

565
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:24,740
Why is there

566
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,640
only one left?

567
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,890
What formula? Nothing.

568
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,630
I just wrote it casually.

569
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:30,790
Why don't you stay for dinner?

570
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,540
Since you're here,

571
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:32,550
play with Lin.

572
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,350
Okay.

573
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:53,930
I heard from Master

574
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,990
you couldn't find a training class.

575
00:24:58,990 --> 00:24:59,740
Let me teach you.

576
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:01,600
Math is not difficult.

577
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,270
Are you free?

578
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:06,830
I'm free later.

579
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:09,410
But I have to

580
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,580
go out later.

581
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:11,450
I have something to do.

582
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,060
It's fine.

583
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:14,820
Just come to the boxing club

584
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:15,390
during the day.

585
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:16,430
I can teach you

586
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,290
when I'm not teaching boxing.

587
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,270
Will it affect your illness?

588
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,420
Do you think the person

589
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,540
who knocked my head is Zhang Shuping?

590
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,220
Why do you think so?

591
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,390
I think he hates me.

592
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,450
Did he take revenge on me?

593
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,740
Don't think too much.

594
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,510
Mr. Zhang is not that kind of person.

595
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,460
Who is the person then?

596
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,640
Don't think about it.

597
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,500
The police will find the culprit.

598
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,420
Mr. Ji,

599
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:58,560
what's your personality

600
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,960
in daily life?

601
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:04,760
I'm quite lively and optimistic.

602
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:07,460
I'm sorry.

603
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,050
My friend is here.

604
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,620
Let's take a break.

605
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,150
Okay, thank you.

606
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:11,670
Thank you.

607
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,100
Excuse me.

608
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,450
What's so urgent?

609
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:18,610
Let's talk.

610
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,380
Take a seat.

611
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,330
You went to see Zhang Shuping?

612
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:32,810
For what?

613
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:35,940
Keep acting.

614
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,220
Listen.

615
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,540
Zhang Shuping told me everything.

616
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,880
He broke his promise.

617
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,340
He promised not to tell you.

618
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,180
Wait.

619
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,860
Why did you do that?

620
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:47,900
For what?

621
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,840
For you.

622
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,070
You just wanted me to take

623
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,180
the best postgraduate entrance class?

624
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,590
How much money did you plan

625
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,620
to pay Zhang Shuping?

626
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,380
It's not for him. It's for investment.

627
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:01,810
I'll invest 7.6 million

628
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,400
for 18% of his shares.

629
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,770
But we haven't signed the contract yet.

630
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:06,560
Over seven million?

631
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,340
Zhang Shuping said it's overpriced.

632
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:12,290
I asked Lu to check it.

633
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,560
According to the market,

634
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,430
we need to

635
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,820
use about 6.5 million

636
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:19,710
to buy

637
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,820
18% of the shares.

638
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:23,220
To let me take the class,

639
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,460
you're willing to

640
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,010
spend more than a million yuan?

641
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,570
That's a lot.

642
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,220
It's nothing.

643
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,780
We are friends.

644
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:35,470
No. Do you know

645
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,970
what you're doing now

646
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,850
is beyond the range of friends?

647
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,820
I can't accept it.

648
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,450
Why not?

649
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,740
What's our relationship?

650
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,090
We travelled through time together,

651
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,100
became younger together,

652
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,260
skipped school together,

653
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,430
and got scolded together.

654
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,740
And we acknowledged someone as father.

655
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,010
Do you like me?

656
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,360
Yes. I like you.

657
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,480
I mean the love between men and women.

658
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,470
No one knows

659
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,490
our secret.

660
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,750
This experience is so important.

661
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:28,540
As an actor,

662
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:29,860
I need to feel it.

663
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:30,630
Remember.

664
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,990
Don't expose

665
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:32,890
our identity.

666
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,060
What identity?

667
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,310
Which city will the 24th Winter Olympics

668
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:38,330
be held?

669
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:39,500
Beijing.

670
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:45,030
We're friends.

671
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,450
I'm Ji Jiang.

672
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,840
Do you think we can go back?

673
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,770
Let's just leave the orphanage.

674
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:52,070
I don't think we

675
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,710
travel to the past,

676
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,220
but a parallel world.

677
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,200
I have to go back.

678
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:58,450
Promise.

679
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:04,570
Let's work hard together.

680
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,770
Let's go home together.

681
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,380
Let's work hard together. Let's go home together.

682
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:25,960
Yes.

683
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:30,460
When?

684
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,300
I don't know.

685
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,840
Maybe

686
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,030
when we were at the secret base.

687
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,070
Is it impossible between us?

688
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,220
Hua Juan.

689
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,010
I really really

690
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,930
cherish

691
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,390
a friend like you.

692
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,310
It's not because you are rich,

693
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,290
or because you're a star.

694
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,530
It's really because we have

695
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,000
many unforgettable memories.

696
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,880
Like you said before,

697
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,660
we fought

698
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,910
together, right?

699
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:04,730
So I...

700
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,170
I'm grateful for your love for me,

701
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:09,980
and

702
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,690
for everything you've done for me and Lin.

703
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:13,830
But there's something

704
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,450
I have to make it clear.

705
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,150
I don't want to be the person

706
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:17,940
who keeps pestering you,

707
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,590
gets some benefits

708
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,830
from you

709
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,900
and then kicks you out.

710
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,440
If we can't

711
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,740
keep our distance,

712
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,930
I'd rather stay away from you.

713
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,510
You're still so straightforward.

714
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:43,780
I'm sorry.

715
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,010
I have to make it clear.

716
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,800
I really don't want to hurt you.

717
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:49,810
But I think

718
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,880
I'm already hurt.

719
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,720
The later I said it, the more upset you would be.

720
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,830
It's not too late to say it now.

721
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:03,910
Well...

722
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,460
Can we still be friends?

723
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:08,700
Of course.

724
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:12,140
You will always be

725
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,190
my best friend.

726
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,300
Come, give me a hug.

727
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,700
For friendship.

728
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,330
Ji Jiang.

729
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,460
Someone is taking photo.

730
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,050
Someone is taking photo.

731
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,380
Someone is taking photo.

732
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,270
Ji Jiang.

733
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,000
I'm leaving.

734
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,260
I'll get someone to give you a ride.

735
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:49,920
No need.

736
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:50,590
I'll go back.

737
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:51,930
Bye.

738
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,660
What is she doing here?

739
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,500
Nothing.

740
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,650
Just for a talk.

741
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,440
What's wrong?

742
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,140
Are you not feeling well?

743
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,700
I'm fine.

744
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:17,870
Just a hypo.

745
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,530
Let's call it a day?

746
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,990
We could record the rest tomorrow.

747
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,650
No. Let me take a rest.

748
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,450
Let's continue later.

749
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,330
Take a rest.

750
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,460
I'll talk to them.

751
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,540
Lu,

752
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,590
as for Director Zeng's drama

753
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,380
you told me before,

754
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,900
give me the script.

755
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,820
I want to read it.

756
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,490
Okay.

757
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,800
On the other hand,

758
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,030
according to

759
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,070
the division method,

760
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:04,770
we can divide it into two parts.

761
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,460
We keep dividing

762
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,470
the left part.

763
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,700
Leave the other part behind.

764
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,490
Then for the value of λ,

765
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,720
no matter what's the value of the n,

766
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:13,850
it won't be

767
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:14,530
a small number.

768
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:15,620
So the value of λ

769
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:16,630
exactly reflects

770
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,890
the extent of the division.

771
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:18,820
Yes.

772
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:19,800
Second,

773
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,660
to select the points.

774
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,620
Mr. Pei,

775
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,570
aren't you nervous about your match?

776
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:26,600
No.

777
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,930
In the zone between xi-1 and xi...

778
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,400
What do you prepare for the match?

779
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,020
Before the match,

780
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:33,980
we'll

781
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,840
watch the opponent's videos

782
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:35,630
and study his fighting style.

783
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:36,820
But the next opponent

784
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,300
is a green hand,

785
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:37,980
just like me.

786
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,950
So there's nothing to study.

787
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,240
Okay, let's take n points.

788
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,100
Of course, this point

789
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,260
is also self-willed.

790
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:46,940
Listen carefully.

791
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:49,680
I'm listening.

792
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,580
I'm really listening.

793
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,270
But you've taught

794
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,230
for three hours.

795
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,110
Three hours.

796
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,770
We don't even have a break.

797
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,390
If you want to make up all the

798
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,780
undergraduate courses in a short time,

799
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,520
you must work harder.

800
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:02,860
You know what?

801
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,380
Sometimes,

802
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,340
I really hope

803
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:04,980
I can be a genius

804
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,930
like you.

805
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,230
Then I don't have to

806
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:07,940
to work so hard.

807
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,739
You're wrong.

808
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,330
Genius usually work harder

809
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,060
than ordinary people.

810
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:13,670
But they work

811
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:14,290
more efficiently,

812
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,250
so their progress looks more obvious.

813
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,420
Of course,

814
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,360
ordinary people have to work harder

815
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,179
even they couldn't see the result.

816
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:21,659
It's unfair.

817
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,360
Mr. Pei, please continue.

818
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:31,850
Let's continue selecting the points.

819
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,050
Now,

820
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,659
select a point casually

821
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,239
on every part.

822
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,719
Pei Zhi, Pei Zhi, Pei Zhi.

823
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:39,449
Your mother is here.

824
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,739
Hurry up and collect the books.

825
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:44,620
Should I hide for a while?

826
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,150
It's okay. I can't hide anyone here.

827
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:46,820
I'll talk to my mom.

828
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,420
No, no, no.

829
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,889
I'm not ready yet.

830
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,480
Hi, you're here.

831
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:58,510
I brought Pei Zhi

832
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,290
some clothes.

833
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,040
Well,

834
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:00,900
let me help you.

835
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:01,730
The stairs are quite long.

836
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:02,690
No need.

837
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:03,830
Be careful.

838
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,540
Don't catch a cold.

839
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:05,570
I'm fine.

840
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,450
I'm fine.

841
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:07,170
I won't catch a cold.

842
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,420
Alright.

843
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,750
Mom, are you okay?

844
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:20,740
I'm fine.

845
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,560
Why are you here?

846
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,220
Can't I visit you?

847
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,080
It's getting cold.

848
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,620
I brought you some clothes.

849
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:29,820
I also brought some medicine.

850
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,310
Don't catch a cold.

851
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,590
I've prepared them for you.

852
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,070
Why are your clothes

853
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,030
hanging

854
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,710
outside?

855
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,050
I'm going to sort it out.

856
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:41,940
Let me help you.

857
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,230
I can do it myself.

858
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,510
Are you still blaming me

859
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,900
for not understanding you?

860
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,720
I know

861
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,310
you're sad

862
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,980
after your dad passed away.

863
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:55,900
You and your dad were the closest.

864
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:58,810
Get me a glass of water.

865
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,790
I understand.

866
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,360
I often dream about

867
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,900
your dad at night.

868
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,940
But what you said that day,

869
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,720
the parallel world,

870
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,390
doesn't make sense at all.

871
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,500
Mom, I'm not blaming you.

872
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:16,720
Mom!

873
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,070
The more I forbid you to do,

874
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:32,330
the more you want to do, right?

875
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:33,870
Sorry.

876
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:34,630
I asked Pei Zhi...

877
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,500
Please go out for a while.

878
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,660
I have something to tell him.

879
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,390
Okay.

880
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:43,550
Mom.

881
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,090
Lin Zhaoxi is my friend.

882
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,070
I have the right to make friends normally.

883
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,410
Make friends normally?

884
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,290
In broad daylight,

885
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,320
you're in the dark room

886
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,260
and she's locked in that cabinet.

887
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,140
What are you doing?

888
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,320
I can do whatever I want.

889
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,770
Aren't you ashamed?

890
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,520
Aren't you afraid of

891
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,310
gossip about you?

892
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:01,120
Mom, everyone is busy.

893
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,470
Who would be so bored

894
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,060
to pay attention to other people's lives?

895
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,020
What are you doing here?

896
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:09,820
Go on your training.

897
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,200
Training.

898
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:14,330
Training.

899
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,910
I'm going back too.

900
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:24,980
You guys talk.

901
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,220
Mom, I admit that sometimes

902
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:31,900
you're right, but...

903
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:36,860
But I need to

904
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,880
talk to you.

905
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,070
Girl,

906
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,210
be careful.

907
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,790
Your future mother-in-law is fierce.

908
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,550
She's not my mother-in-law.

909
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:46,760
Pei Zhi and I are friends.

910
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,020
After friends, you'll be his girlfriend.

911
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,580
Then his wife.

912
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,550
She will be your mother-in-law.

913
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,620
and you'll be her daughter-in-law.

914
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,260
You will suffer.

915
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:56,100
I remember

916
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,430
when I first met you,

917
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:58,930
you were

918
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:00,420
a heroine.

919
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,620
I didn't expect

920
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,070
you're defeated

921
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:03,940
by her.

922
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,340
That makes sense.

923
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,620
Who is Aunt Pei?

924
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,120
She turned a boxing champion

925
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,320
into a hen-pecked man.

926
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,120
Boxing champion?

927
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,140
Pei Zhi's father.

928
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,160
Xi, come here.

929
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,100
Okay.

930
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:30,490
You go in first.

931
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:31,330
Okay.

932
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:42,110
Xi, Pei Zhi told me

933
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,460
you studied philosophy in college.

934
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:45,640
Yes.

935
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,280
Then I'm relieved.

936
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:50,790
People who study philosophy

937
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:52,080
are simpler.

938
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:53,560
It's better than studying math.

939
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,260
Pei Zhi told me

940
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:57,460
he really likes you.

941
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,100
In that case,

942
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:00,640
you two should

943
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,510
be together

944
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,140
and get along well.

945
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,430
You should keep studying philosophy.

946
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:09,170
Go out and have fun.

947
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:09,960
Go shopping

948
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,080
and watch movies.

949
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,560
I agree with your relationship.

950
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,080
I hope both you two are good.

951
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:24,330
Mom, we're leaving.

952
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:25,770
Let's go.

953
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,840
Goodbye.

954
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:33,760
Xi.

955
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,050
Don't forget

956
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,290
what I told you last time.

957
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:41,530
You have to let him have a live.

958
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,680
Don't let him study math.

959
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:47,650
Let's go.

960
00:39:58,890 --> 00:39:59,380
Pei Zhi.

961
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,980
What did you say to her?

962
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:03,410
She suddenly...

963
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,740
I told her

964
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:12,900
I won't be affected by you and master

965
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:14,010
and won't study math again.

966
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:17,860
And

967
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:18,630
after this period,

968
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,320
I will find

969
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,230
an office job.

970
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,060
So,

971
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:25,270
are you really going to give up math?

972
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,540
Will you be unhappy?

973
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,370
I respect your choice.

974
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:37,770
But I think

975
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,580
it's a pity.

976
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:41,330
You are so enthusiastic

977
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,430
and talented.

978
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,190
But I believe

979
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:44,900
you can do

980
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,010
whatever you do.

981
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:51,180
So what are we going to do now?

982
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,380
Are we really going shopping?

983
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:58,720
You don't want to go shopping?

984
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,230
I don't like shopping.

985
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:02,430
I always find the things I want,

986
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,180
buy them, and leave.

987
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,280
Me too.

988
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:09,400
Well...

989
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,550
But it seems that

990
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,350
I haven't gone shopping

991
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,170
with a boy.

992
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,190
I don't know how it feels.

993
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:14,380
I've never gone shopping

994
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,170
with a girl.

995
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,660
I don't know how it feels, either.

996
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,950
Why don't we give it a try?

997
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,040
Have a try.

998
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:24,860
This is Director Zeng,

999
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,720
the director of this drama.

1000
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:27,330
Hello, Director Zeng.

1001
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,460
Mr. Ji.

1002
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,880
I've always wanted to work with you.

1003
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:30,950
Mr. Lu said

1004
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:31,860
you are interested

1005
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,370
in our script.

1006
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:33,350
I came here

1007
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:34,290
to talk about the drama.

1008
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:34,790
OK.

1009
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:41,750
Please have a seat.

1010
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:53,620
I've read the script.

1011
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,300
It's wonderful.

1012
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,590
Director Zeng is here

1013
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:59,110
to explain the script

1014
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,300
in person.

1015
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,940
If there's no problem,

1016
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,630
we can sign the contract.

1017
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,730
-Is that okay? -Yes.

1018
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,620
You're such a responsible director.

1019
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:11,030
I'm more confident in your drama.

1020
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,200
Mr. Ji, you flatter me.

1021
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,670
Let me tell you about this play.

1022
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,170
In the beginning,

1023
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,100
it's like...

1024
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:26,110
How long did it take to walk

1025
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,180
from the first floor

1026
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:28,220
to this floor?

1027
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:29,060
Eight and a half minutes.

1028
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:30,730
Eight and a half minutes.

1029
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,790
How long does it take to go shopping normally?

1030
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:36,660
Half an hour?

1031
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:38,680
More than that.

1032
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:40,380
Take Bao Xiaomeng as an example.

1033
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:41,390
It usually takes her

1034
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:42,440
-four hours. -Four hours?

1035
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:43,120
Yes.

1036
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,590
Think about it.

1037
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,970
If a mall contains four floors,

1038
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:46,900
she will need

1039
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:48,210
an hour per floor.

1040
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,460
This floor should be 80 meters.

1041
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,870
Including the time to walk around,

1042
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,720
it'll only take five minutes.

1043
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,420
Does she have a boyfriend?

1044
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,870
Not yet.

1045
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:00,580
Then you're wrong.

1046
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,770
She should need more time.
