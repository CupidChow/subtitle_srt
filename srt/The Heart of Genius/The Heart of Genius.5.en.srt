Why do I feel

5
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,620
you're absent-minded today?

6
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,390
I'm fine.

7
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,140
Just too absorbed in looking at you.

8
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:43,740
Beautiful.

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:44,820

Okay.

This is a kind of happiness.

But I'm your dad.

you'll regret it later.

Lin didn't come.

Are you sad?

31
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,829
As long as he can come for photo-taking,

32
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,000
I don't care.

33
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,150
He's not my real dad anyway.

34
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,140
Stop pretending.

35

He's your real dad.

36
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,500
He's your dad in every sense.

37
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,860
That's the tie of kinship.

38

What is this?

39

So thick.

42
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,180
It's worth at least...

43
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,720

You'll regret it.

It's kind of similar

with the Strawberry World.

101
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,340
The only thing we should do

102

is avoiding being eliminated.

103
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,320
Eliminated?

104
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,290
There's a mechanism of selection

105

for this training camp.

106

Anyone who fails the exam

107
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,350
will get knocked out.

108

There were 80 people entering the camp.

109

But only over 20 people

110

were present in the photo.

111
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,060
What important information!

112
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,810
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

113
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,760
It's okay.

we are done.

119

and managed to be here.

129

According to your scores,

the lower-ranked students

145
00:06:58,930 --> 00:06:59,850
will be eliminated each round.

146

Those who give up will be eliminated.

147

Those who violate the camp discipline will be eliminated.

148
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,930
And once you're out,

149
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,270
I will ask

150
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,070

157

in front of you.

158
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,070
It's 11:01

159
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,380
at this moment.

160
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,160
Take your luggage

161
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,140
and rush to the classroom.

162
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,190

166
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:40,740
No way.

167

you must hand in the paper before 12.

173

176
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,510
after the test.

177
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,000
So no one will watch your luggage

178
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,060
when you have the test.

179
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,630
You must take

180
00:07:58,659 --> 00:07:59,420
your belongings with you,

181
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:00,780
and find the classroom by yourself.

182
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,410
Hurry up.

183
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,570
And good luck.

184
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,060
The test now begins.

185
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,060
Carry the luggage. Let's go.

186
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,410
Sir, it's not safe.

187
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,900
We're all young.

188
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,780
That's right.

189
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:13,700
Sorry.

190
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,290
I'm just explaining the rules.

191
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,830
I don't have the say.

192
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,130
-Something's wrong. -It's 11:05 now.

193
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,770
You still have 55 minutes.

194
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,940
Hey, this is not right.

195
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,740
What's wrong?

196
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,950
In Strawberry World, there were tests and selection,

197
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,880
but they were not so unreasonable as here.

198
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,680
Why should we

199
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,340
move our luggage before the test?

200
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,590
We have to help them now.

201
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,340
How?

202
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:35,980
It's hard for you to move your own luggage.

203
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:37,950
I have an idea.

204
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,460
You go up and take the test first.

205
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,679
I'll stay and take care of our luggage.

206
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:42,780
Then my turn after you finish.

207
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,020
Relay?

208
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:44,960
Relay.

209
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,140
No way.

210
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,860
There are less than one hour left.

211
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,260
I only need ten minutes.

212
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,650
Pei Zhi.

213
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,660
Trust me.

214
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:17,890
Go chase them!

215
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:22,790
Let's go.

216
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,630
Liang.

217
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,850
Liang, if we follow them,

218
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,210
we'll waste a dozen minutes.

219
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,220
No need to remind me.

220
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,730
Hey, not here.

221
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,390
Lin Zhaoxi.

222
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,350
It's here.

223
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,620
I need three minutes to go downstairs.

224
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,450
Pei Zhi needs three minutes to go upstairs.

225
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,460
I have to finish it

226
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,060
before 11:44.

227
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
32 minutes left.

228
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:22,440
Come in.

229
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:26,950
Mr. Zhang.

230
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,630
A student named Pei Zhi

231
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,410
volunteered to stay

232
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,310
and watch all the luggage.

233
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,100
So most students

234
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,240
went upstairs without their luggage.

235
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,190
He's quite dedicated.

236
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,960
Pei Zhi...

237
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,820
He got a full mark before, right?

238
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,090
Yes.

239
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,260
Is he giving up?

240
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,470
Should I talk to him?

241
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,100
No.

242
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,230
He should learn

243
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,410
to bear the consequences.

244
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,860
Another ten minutes.

245
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:33,650
Miss,

246
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,270
I'm done.

247
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,140
Give it to me.

248
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,560
Lin Zhaoxi, Pei Zhi,

249
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,340
count on you.

250
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:55,980
Pei Zhi.

251
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,320
Sorry, I'm late.

252
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,000
Come in.

253
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,950
Everyone, be quiet.

254
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,020
Go on your test.

255
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,660
The first one...

256
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,660
Are you okay?

257
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:20,620
Don't worry.

258
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:24,790
Who is this?

259
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,540
Hello, everyone.

260
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,040
Nice to meet you.

261
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:35,360
Nice to meet you, sir.

262
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,960
I'm Zhang Shuping.

263
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,620
As you guessed,

264
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,130
I was the bad guy

265
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:40,870
in the speaker.

266
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,820
Welcome to the training camp.

267
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,200
Done.

268
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,350
I'll announce the results now.

269
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,040
Raise your hand if you hear your name.

270
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,450
Liang Shuang, 72.

271
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,870
Lu Zhihao,

272
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,140
63.

273
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,790
Idiot.

274
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,470
Chen Chengcheng,

275
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,400
75.

276
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,620
Liu Xu,

277
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,140
81.

278
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,920
Yu Tianjiao,

279
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,540
65.

280
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,540
Lin Zhaoxi.

281
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:29,880
Lin Zhaoxi.

282
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:31,570
Sir,

283
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,270
Lin Zhaoxi is helping with the luggage downstairs.

284
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,220
The girl

285
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,150
who finished and left

286
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,190
in less than half an hour?

287
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,020
Probably she is.

288
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,550
Mr. Xie.

289
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,060
Can you replace her

290
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:42,780
and ask her to come up?

291
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:43,600
OK.

292
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,450
Lin Zhaoxi, 91.

293
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,420
Dang Aimin,

294
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,290
70.

295
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,130
Zhang Liang,

296
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,880
98.

297
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,370
Pei Zhi,

298
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,510
Pei...

299
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,300
100.

300
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:17,970
That's amazing.

301
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,560
Quiet.

302
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,190
Qian Chengyi.

303
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,770
Go up now.

304
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,050
Is the test over?

305
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:29,820
Why didn't they come down?

306
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:30,970
The test has been scored on the spot.

307
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,390
And there will be a class meeting later.

308
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,210
What about the luggage?

309
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,390
I'll take care of them for you.

310
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,040
Thank you.

311
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,050
Do you know

312
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:40,890
your score?

313
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,220
91.

314
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,420
Good job.

315
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,320
Thank you.

316
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:56,140
When their parents arrive,

317
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,100
you go with me.

318
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:57,680
OK.

319
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,700
Take them back to the dorm

320
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,460
for a short rest.

321
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,580
Are you Lin Zhaoxi?

322
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:07,300
Go in.

323
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,260
Good. They're still here.

324
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,990
[These five aren't in the photo.]

325
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,420
Your paper.

326
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,260
Nice.

327
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,660
You loser.

328
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,250
He spent more than 20 minutes

329
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,540
than you.

330
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,790
Why are you so proud?

331
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,400
Unfortunately,

332
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,340
the last five trainees have to leave here.

333
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:44,980
Because they didn't even

334
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:45,860
achieve 60 points.

335
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,700
We have informed

336
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:48,620
their parents.

337
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,420
Before their parents come,

338
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:51,550
the psychological counselor

339
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,840
will have a good chat with them.

340
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,310
They're really leaving?

341
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,390
It's all true.

342
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,010
It's so embarrassing

343
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,700
to be sent back like this.

344
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,020
Don't worry.

345
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,600
Although only five of you

346
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,980
can be members of the city team,

347
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,599
some may also have a chance

348
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,079
to learn the complete program.

349
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,869
As long as you work hard,

350
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,300
I won't easily eliminate any of you.

351
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,300
Sir.

352
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,849
When is the next test?

353
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,880
Raise your hand next time.

354
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,270
You don't need to know

355
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,589
when the next test is.

356
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,630
What you need to do

357
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,250
is to be prepared at any time.

358
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,860
Some of you are smart.

359
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,520
But one day,

360
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,010
when you have a chance

361
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,080
to face the real difficult math problems,

362
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,020
you will find

363
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,380
the advantage you have now

364
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,020
is insignificant.

365
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,710
Intelligence is not a crucial factor.

366
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,320
Diligence is what matters.

367
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,220
Pei Zhi, please stand up.

368
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,220
Pei Zhi got a full mark

369
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:56,890
in this test,

370
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,850
and it only took him ten minutes.

371
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:00,920
Let's applaud

372
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,620
for his performance.

373
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,980
Lin Zhaoxi, please stand up.

374
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,880
You got 91 points.

375
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,620
Well done as well.

376
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,190
I didn't ask you to sit down.

377
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,480
But I want to ask you a question.

378
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,550
Do you know

379
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,550
why I asked all of you

380
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,140
to take your luggage?

381
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,990
You wanted us

382
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,310
to take the test

383
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,480
in extreme situations.

384
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,920
A kind of simulation.

385
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,350
But I think

386
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,300
it's meaningless.

387
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,870
It couldn't reflect

388
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,140
our real ability.

389
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,830
It seems that you don't know

390
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,820
what is extreme.

391
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,060
Can you make sure

392
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,070
you are always

393
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:57,940
100% prepared

394
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,310
in each test

395
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,020
of your life?

396
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,860
Can you make sure

397
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,710
you'll never have

398
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,010
a headache, fever, or diarrhea

399
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:05,710
in each test?

400
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:23,890
Dad.

401
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:25,800
You're back.

402
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,330
I didn't pass.

403
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,450
So what?

404
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,350
It's just a summer camp.

405
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:31,860
Go in.

406
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:32,490
I'll cook for you later.

407
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,690
It's okay.

408
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:50,890
No, I can't.

409
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,110
Today's test,

410
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,730
however,

411
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,080
is one of the accidents

412
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,790
you may encounter in the future.

413
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,130
Imagine it.

414
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,820
The road is crowded.

415
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,210
You've run several kilometers

416
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:03,890
to take the exam.

417
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,690
You sit in the classroom,

418
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:05,920
and have to answer the questions immediately.

419
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,440
With today's experience,

420
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,540
will you be

421
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:09,790
calmer?

422
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:10,750
Is it possible that

423
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,870
because of your calmness,

424
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,390
you'll be more likely

425
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,130
to go to a prestigious school.

426
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,790
But the purpose of study

427
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,480
is not just for the tests.

428
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,390
Is it really necessary

429
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,950
to prepare for an extreme situation

430
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,250
of a very low probability?

431
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,640
In today's society,

432
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,790
the purpose of study,

433
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,140
for most people,

434
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,410
is to pass the tests.

435
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,520
Tests, exams, competitions.

436
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,110
You will be left behind if you fail.

437
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,060
The social resources are limited.

438
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,340
Test

439
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,700
is to select

440
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,410
in a relatively fair way

441
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,470
layer by layer,

442
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,470
so as to

443
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,710
allocate education resources.

444
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,500
Whether you accept it or not,

445
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,310
this is the reality.

446
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,460
You two are smart.

447
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:55,510
I admit it.

448
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,580
I can understand

449
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,720
what you did just now

450
00:20:59,060 --> 00:20:59,970
was not for yourselves,

451
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:00,860
but for everyone.

452
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,010
But your action

453
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,610
has violated the discipline.

454
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,630
So I have to give you

455
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,810
the following punishment.

456
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,050
In the next week,

457
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,660
you two must

458
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,300
wake up at 6 a.m.

459
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,730
and clean up the space

460
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,900
in front of the teaching building.

461
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,180
Spick-and-span.

462
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:21,610
All right.

463
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,410
Now go downstairs

464
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,230
and get your luggage.

465
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,980
The teacher will assign your dorms.

466
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:27,870
Let's call it a day.

467
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:32,810
Everyone,

468
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,680
take your luggage.

469
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,200
We have arranged

470
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,150
your dorms.

471
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,800
Miss. Xiang Ke

472
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,270
will give the keys to you.

473
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,750
Everyone,

474
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:44,260
gather in half an hour.

475
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,380
Don't be late.

476
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,940
I repeat.

477
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,060
No one is allowed to be late.

478
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,410
Hello, I'm Yu Tianjiao.

479
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:53,850
I'm Lin Zhaoxi.

480
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:54,850
I know you.

481
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,200
Everyone knows you now.

482
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,420
Come with me.

483
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,120
Sun Jiaming and the others.

484
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,330
Did Mr. Zhang

485
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,510
deliberately

486
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,630
let us see them

487
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,560
to be sent away?

488
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,680
This is not a math training camp.

489
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,480
It's just an evil camp.

490
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:18,580
Exactly.

491
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,420
-They were sent here this morning. -Calm down.

492
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,470
Mr. Zhang will be here soon.

493
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,110
He will give you

494
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,030
a reasonable explanation.

495
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:23,680
I...

496
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,330
Our kid just...

497
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,740
Oh, there.

498
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,260
Come on.

499
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:30,850
Honey, what's wrong?

500
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,300
What's the matter?

501
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:31,960
What happened?

502
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,100
Honey, what happened?

503
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:33,900
Why are you back?

504
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,660
Why are you back?

505
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:35,870
What's going on?

506
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,980
What training camp is this?

507
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,340
It's only been a day.

508
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,220
-Why is my kid worse than others? -Come on.

509
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,260
They haven't been in class for a day.

510
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:41,780
They haven't learned anything.

511
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,420
What are you selecting?

512
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,200
What you did

513
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,710
will give a blow to my kid.

514
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,500
You must

515
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,300
give us an explanation.

516
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,910
I can understand your feelings.

517
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,380
But you may remember the agreement

518
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,790
you signed before entering the camp.

519
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,280
The rules have been set

520
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:56,940
from the beginning.

521
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,490
Thank you for your support.

522
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,620
What?

523
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,380
Miss. Wang,

524
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,340
send them back

525
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:03,940
safely.

526
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,520
Okay.

527
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,550
Bye.

528
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,340
Let's go.

529
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,220
Let's go.

530
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,790
We're no longer going, babe. It's okay.

531
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,820
It's okay.

532
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:11,840
We won't be here any more.

533
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:12,690
Parents,

534
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:13,740
this way.

535
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:14,870
Nonsense.

536
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,580
No way.

537
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,880
Let's go. I'll get you another one.

538
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,380
Lin,

539
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,800
your daughter came this morning.

540
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,090
I gave the stuff to her.

541
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,300
She took a bus at the entrance.

542
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,220
Where did she go?

543
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,540
A summer camp.

544
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,790
I have to say something.

545
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,990
You screw around like this every day.

546
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,430
Nothing to worry as long as you're not starved.

547
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,470
You live a comfortable life.

548
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,150
But you can't run away

549
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,020
from your responsibility.

550
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,950
She's not my daughter.

551
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,860
Are you so sure?

552
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:53,970
Probably

553
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,570
99 percent.

554
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:58,700
For this kind of thing,

555
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,920
you have to figure it out

556
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:00,790
even with the slightest chance.

557
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:01,440
Right?

558
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,740
All right, I'm going to buy groceries.

559
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,830
I have to cook for my family after work.

560
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:06,620
Be careful.

561
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,480
Okay.

562
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,320
Zhaosheng.

563
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,420
What are you looking at?

564
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,770
Nothing. I'm just spacing out.

565
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,130
Now,

566
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,620
we have

567
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:55,160
the student representative Zhang Liang

568
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,020
to have a speech.

569
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:56,920
Let's welcome.

570
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,550
It must have something to do with his family.

571
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,180
It must be arranged in advance.

572
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,360
Otherwise,

573
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,190
it's Pei's turn to speak.

574
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:05,900
Dear teachers,

575
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,300
-dear classmates... -Zhang Liang's good at speech.

576
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,340
Hello, everyone.

577
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,060
I'm Zhang Liang

578
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,450
from Experimental Elementary School.

579
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,980
Nice to meet you.

580
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,030
It's an honor

581
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,020
to speak here

582
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,700
on behalf of everyone

583
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,110
in the 2006 Anping

584
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:19,980
Olympic Math Training Camp.

585
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,510
We should,

586
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,340
under the teachers' guidance,

587
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,260
study hard, listen carefully,

588
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:26,820
and finish the homework

589
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:27,990
-assigned by the teachers. -Without this speech,

590
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,260
I almost forgot that he's still a child.

591
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,460
Live up to our parents' expectations.

592
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,540
Thank you.

593
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,270
Next, let's welcome

594
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:39,960
the honorary principal

595
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:40,750
of this training camp,

596
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,820
the tenured math professor

597
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,620
of Sanwei University,

598
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,220
the famous mathematician and educationalist,

599
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:47,310
Professor Zeng Qingran.

600
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,750
He will have

601
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,500
the final opening speech for us.

602
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,980
Because of his international meeting,

603
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,590
Professor Zeng

604
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,500
can't be here today.

605
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,960
But he specially recorded a video

606
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,460
for us.

607
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,510
Please watch it carefully.

608
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,900
I'm sorry for

609
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,240
meeting you in this way.

610
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,660
A sense of distance, right?

611
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,260
But I think

612
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,700
this distance

613
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,500
makes both of us

614
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:21,580
feel relaxed.

615
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,780
We did the initial analysis.

616
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,710
According to the two exams,

617
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,250
the students can be divided into four ranks.

618
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,100
The fourth rank includes 15 students

619
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,350
who barely passed

620
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,630
and may be eliminated

621
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,810
in coming tests.

622
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,610
The third one includes 46 students

623
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,340
who are of average abilities,

624
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,680
but most of them can't make it to the end.

625
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,920
The second rank includes 13 students,

626
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,590
including Zhang Liang and Lin Zhaoxi.

627
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,900
They are the most likely

628
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:49,140
to stay till the end.

629
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,590
They will probably

630
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,430
stand out at last

631
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,340
and join the representative team.

632
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:55,740
Who's in the first rank?

633
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,040
We all agree that

634
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:58,650
Pei Zhi

635
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,690
is literally superior to others.

636
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:05,860
When I was young,

637
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,650
my father once

638
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,980
depicted a scene for me.

639
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,920
When the world started,

640
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,140
it was pitch-dark.

641
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,340
Then

642
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,870
a very tiny

643
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,430
but dense point

644
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,920
had an explosion.

645
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,880
It turned from the inside.

646
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,820
Time spread.

647
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,660
Space spread.

648
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,740
All of what we know

649
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,130
and don't know about the world

650
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,190
started at this moment.

651
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:40,580
They kept growing.

652
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,020
For countless years,

653
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,580
on a very small

654
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,400
planet,

655
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,370
someone opened its eyes.

656
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,520
It's a speculation

657
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,130
of the formation of our universe.

658
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,780
Maybe one day it will be proved

659
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,580
or be overturned.

660
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,280
Both will make sense.

661
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,420
My dear pupils,

662
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,220
everyday,

663
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,140
we stand

664
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,730
on the edge of things known and unknown.

665
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,510
The world is too big

666
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,020
but we know too little.

667
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,060
Everything

668
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,620
seems to be uncertain.

669
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,510
But I want to tell you,

670
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,500
in this world,

671
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:24,110
unknown is the most wonderful thing.

672
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,420
At the end of February 1995, she was abandoned

673
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,330
at the gate of the orphanage,

674
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,040
and a note was left

675
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,720
with the name Lin Zhaoxi.

676
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:44,900
I thought

677
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,880
her family named her.

678
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,260
I had a dream.

679
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:51,770
I dreamed that we were father and daughter.

680
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:53,770
Dad.

681
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,880
Maybe you find it hard to believe

682
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,140
what I'm saying now.

683
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,220
But I promise

684
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,480
I'm telling the truth.

685
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,120
I'm your daughter.

686
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,080
Japanese sword drawing.

687
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,540
What are you two doing?

688
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:07,620
You're here.

689
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,200
You can be our witness.

690
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,690
Today, I, Hua Juan Gucheng,

691
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,580
will fight with Ximen Pei Zhi

692
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,820
at the peak of the Forbidden City.

693
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:14,350
We must battle it out.

694
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,830
Hua Juan insisted on helping.

695
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,680
We've finished the work.

696
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,100
Let's go to the canteen.

697
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,680
Then I don't have to do anything?

698
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,460
Thank you.

699
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,580
It's okay.

700
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,020
Boys should do more.

701
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,100
Let's go.

702
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,780
Ximen Pei Zhi.

703
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,380
Are you running away?

704
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,560
You're really naive.

705
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:40,950
I haven't played like this for years.

706
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:41,690
I'm a bit over-excited.

707
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,340
Let's go.

708
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:46,720
You stinky Voldemort!

709
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,430
I'll beat you to death!

710
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,710
Lin Zhaoxi.

711
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:53,840
Come and help.

712
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,030
Despite anything else,

713
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,820
the food here is really good.

714
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,650
You eat so much.

715
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,550
How did you control your weight

716
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,620
when you were a celebrity?

717
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,960
When I was in Srawberry,

718
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,720
in order to keep fit,

719
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,490
I either starved

720
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,280
or dieted.

721
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,590
Insipid boiled chicken breast.

722
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:23,860
I almost felt like vomiting.

723
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,190
Now I can eat

724
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:25,900
whatever I want.

725
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,110
I think this is the best benefit

726
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,380
living in this world.

727
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,210
Hua Juan.

728
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,780
You must be suffering

729
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,780
in the orphanage.

730
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,300
What else do you want to eat?

731
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:49,390
I'll get it for you.

732
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,720
It's okay. It's okay.

733
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,970
Just enjoy your meal.

734
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,900
Let's eat together.

735
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:03,730
I have no appetite.

736
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,420
Why?

737
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,140
I'm just worried about the next test.

738
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:11,940
You don't need to worry.

739
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,850
You did well.

740
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,580
You don't understand.

741
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,140
It's useless to only get good grades alone.

742
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,180
I won't let either of you

743
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,510
be kicked out.

744
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,630
I promise.

745
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:32,890
Thank you, my little hero.

746
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,260
Take one.

747
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:05,910
Are you still eating?

748
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,440
I'm not afraid of gaining weight now.

749
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,210
It's a rare opportunity.

750
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:11,020
Do you want it?

751
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,380
I don't have a good appetite like you.

752
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,330
Take a look at this.

753
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,780
These are people on the photo?

754
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,860
The numbers below their names

755
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,950
are their scores of last test.

756
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,080
Some of them

757
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,090
were almost eliminated.

758
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,390
I wonder

759
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,490
how they can stick to the end.

760
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,220
They will make progress.

761
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,860
It's good if they can make it by themselves.

762
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:33,750
I'm just afraid

763
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,260
we will have to offer a hand.

764
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,850
What is this?

765
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,340
This is a gift from Professor Zeng.

766
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:47,950
It's also a small challenge

767
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:48,740
for you guys.

768
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,090
[Rule of Kongming Chess]

769
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:52,470
This is the rule.

770
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,450
Mr. Zeng doesn't know

771
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,380
about our situation.

772
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,310
The students are busy with the tests.

773
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,180
They are all in a mess.

774
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,409
Who has the time to study this?

775
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,380
I'm not sure about others,

776
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,639
but he's sure to do so.

777
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,900
When all the chess pieces are placed,

778
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,949
take one out of the centre.

779
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,710
The pieces can only be moved vertically or horizontally,

780
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:25,790
not diagonally.

781
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,520
Skip an adjacent piece

782
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:28,840
to the empty place.

783
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:32,139
The skipped piece is captured.

784
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:34,520
Repeat the above steps

785
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,639
and keep moving.

786
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,239
When reaching a dead position,

787
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,210
count how many pieces are left.

788
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,310
The less pieces left, the more powerful you are.

789
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,380
If there's only one left,

790
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,889
you're a genius.

791
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,140
Boys and girls,

792
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,320
today is the first day of class.

793
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,630
Every morning,

794
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,590
different teachers

795
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,420
will give you a class.

796
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,860
In the afternoon, you'll have free time

797
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,070
and extracurricular activities.

798
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,710
Remember, on the afternoon of the 20th,

799
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,320
you will have

800
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,960
the next selection test.

801
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:19,110
This test is different

802
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:19,780
from that of yesterday.

803
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,130
You'll have several days

804
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:21,880
for the preparation.

805
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,590
I think you've all known that.

806
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,770
Jin's competition is a team competition.

807
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,540
Therefore, this time,

808
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:28,800
we will take

809
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:30,600
a knock-out system for groups.

810
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:32,260
You can team up freely.

811
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,180
Each group includes

812
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,180
five to six members.

813
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,590
According to the average score,

814
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,900
we will rank the teams,

815
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,250
and the last three teams

816
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:41,920
will have to leave us.

817
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:44,950
Sir.

818
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,510
What if someone in the last three teams

819
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,730
have a much higher score?

820
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,750
It's useless.

821
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,210
The average score is the standard.

822
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,730
The last three groups

823
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,710
will all leave us.

824
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,500
So for every team,

825
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,440
well-performed students

826
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,380
should find ways

827
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,420
to help

828
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,420
poor-performed classmates.

829
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,900
We need to develop the spirit of mutual help,

830
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,570
solidarity and friendship.

831
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:11,900
It can't be.

832
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:13,470
What's wrong?

833
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,030
They assess us in this way,

834
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,980
but allow us to freely group together.

835
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,290
In the end,

836
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,560
no one will help others.

837
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,300
Okay, guys,

838
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,920
after the discusstion,

839
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,630
write down on the paper

840
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,180
the leader's name

841
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,170
and your member list.

842
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:31,330
Then,

843
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,910
gather in front of the library.

844
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,610
Mr. Zhang will give you

845
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,250
the first class in the library.

846
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:37,500
OK.

847
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:38,630
Now you have some time

848
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,890
to discuss grouping.

849
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,790
I'll wait for you at the library.

850
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,420
Sir.

851
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,700
What if no one want

852
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:48,550
to team up with me?

853
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,810
What if we can't form a team?

854
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:50,650
Actually,

855
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:51,570
we've considered it.

856
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,820
Those who are not accepted in teams

857
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,300
will automatically become a group.

858
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,680
If there are too many people left,

859
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:57,610
we will divide you

860
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,400
into groups randomly.

861
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,510
Anyway, the final explanation

862
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:01,980
of all the rules

863
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,470
depends on Mr. Zhang.

864
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,770
Pei, Xi,

865
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,540
please consider me.

866
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,070
I got 79 this time.

867
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,560
I'll get 80 next time.

868
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,390
Besides, you have only three members.

869
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,430
You need at least

870
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,450
two members.

871
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:24,740
Pei,

872
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,560
can I join your team?

873
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,690
I can lend you

874
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,450
my video games.

875
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,500
Give us some time

876
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:30,460
to discuss it.

877
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:31,990
Lin Zhaoxi.

878
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,660
What should we do?

879
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,840
You're so cunning.

880
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:50,420
Are you done?

881
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,230
Yes.

882
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,390
You didn't even go in with me,

883
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:54,230
and let me

884
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,030
face those children alone.

885
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:56,760
I'm afraid they would blame me.

886
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,150
Liang, that's good.

887
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,730
Each team has five or six members.

888
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,750
We Winning Five Tigers

889
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,540
have exactly five people.

890
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:10,790
Do you think we should

891
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,700
recruit another one?

892
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:12,890
Wang Feng,

893
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,630
you got 82 points, right?

894
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,330
Yes.

895
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,690
Would you like to join my team?

896
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,330
Sure.

897
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,140
Great.

898
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,240
We have six people now.

899
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,680
Shall we change our name

900
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,700
into Winning Six Tigers?

901
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:22,690
No need.

902
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,180
I think the five of us are good.

903
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,260
Lu Zhihao.

904
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,620
Go to another team.

905
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:27,780
Liang,

906
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,400
are you testing me?

907
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,020
I'm determined to follow you.

908
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,540
You only got over 60

909
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,660
in the last test.

910
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,340
My team doesn't accept waste.

911
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,680
I didn't perform well last time.

912
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,920
I'm sure to improve.

913
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,440
This is the chocolate

914
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,950
my aunt bought me from Switzerland.

915
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,710
Give me another chance.

916
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:47,440
You only have one chance.

917
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,160
Unfortunately, you didn't seize it.

918
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,780
Zhang Liang, you can't do so.

919
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,030
You promised me

920
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:53,920
in the Youth Palace.

921
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:54,860
For you,

922
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,510
I broke up

923
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,370
with Lin Zhaoxi

924
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,110
and Dang Aimin.

925
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,060
Stop wasting time.

926
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,730
Go and team up with others.

927
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,950
If you're late, you'll have to

928
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,180
to form a merely qualified team

929
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,600
with those who got only 60 points.

930
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:26,960
Chen Chengcheng.

931
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,320
You got 75 this time.

932
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,680
The lowest in my team.

933
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,270
If you can't achieve 80

934
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,420
in the next exam...

935
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,510
I will quit.

936
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:34,600
I won't drag you down.

937
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,500
I hope you can keep your promise.

938
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,590
This game seems fun.

939
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,040
Look.

940
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,610
It says that you can contact Professor Zeng

941
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,740
after finishing the chess game.

942
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,400
Does it work?

943
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,800
Can it help you get into Tsinghua?

944
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:51,630
Or recommend you

945
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,610
for admission to Sanwei University?

946
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,300
What a waste of time.

947
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,490
Let's go.

948
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,870
There are fewer and fewer people left.

949
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:13,290
I crossed out 4 members in Zhang Liang's team,

950
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:15,020
and 5 members in Zhao Hongliang's team.

951
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,130
They are all excellent students

952
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,040
Except Chen Chengcheng.

953
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,070
I don't know why

954
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:21,910
he can't make it to the end.

955
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,790
Anyway,

956
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,320
we don't have to worry about them.

957
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:34,900
Li Ming,

958
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:37,840
can I join you?

959
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,650
Sorry.

960
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,660
We're all from the Second Elementary School.

961
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,770
No outsiders.

962
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,730
There are 3 members in Li Ming's team

963
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,760
sticking to the end.

964
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:56,490
It seems that changes happen

965
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,630
in following tests.

966
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,300
There are 7 people left in the classroom.

967
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,210
Lu is also there.

968
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,400
It's probably because of what happened at the Youth Palace.

969
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:08,090
Lu may feel embarrassed to come to us.

970
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:10,430
They are the last seven people

971
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,500
in the photo.

972
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:12,890
Maybe this is fate.

973
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,120
We must help them.

974
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,790
The remaining seven

975
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,270
all played badly.

976
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,240
They'll be done if they're together.

977
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,280
Three of us,

978
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,230
plus Lu.

979
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,790
We can only team up with two more.

980
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,580
What should we do?

981
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:27,760
What are you talking about?

982
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:30,670
Lin Zhaoxi,

983
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,020
why are you drawing on the paper?

984
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,500
Who should we form a team with?

985
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,300
Pei Zhi, are we friends?

986
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,300
Of course.

987
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,300
Good friends?

988
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,400
Best friends.

989
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,110
I really need

990
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:44,940
your help now.

991
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,460
Will you help us?

992
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,390
What can I do?

993
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,100
I'll listen to you.

994
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:48,920
Thank you.

995
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,690
I'll arrange

996
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:51,720
the grouping.

997
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:52,620
Okay?

998
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,090
Hey, cheer up.

999
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:06,130
Except Pei Zhi and I,

1000
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,830
everyone here

1001
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,370
didn't do well

1002
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:10,530
in the last exam.

1003
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,570
No one wants to team up with you.

1004
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,380
Are you planning to

1005
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:16,080
be grouped together

1006
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,070
and do nothing?

1007
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:18,740
And then leave here dejectedly

1008
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,320
after the next test?

1009
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:21,970
Do you want to accept it?

1010
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:22,900
Of course not.

1011
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,450
No. No.

1012
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,680
I have an idea

1013
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:26,580
to help all of us

1014
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,820
sail through the difficulties together.

1015
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:28,900
I need everyone here

1016
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,130
to follow my arrangements.

1017
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,370
We should

1018
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:32,050
work hard,

1019
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:32,950
fight together,

1020
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,510
and then pass

1021
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,420
the next test.

1022
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,190
Are you willing to do this?

1023
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,140
Yes.

1024
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:38,920
Me too.

1025
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:39,550
Yes.

1026
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,790
Xi, thank you for counting me in.

1027
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:42,910
In the Youth Palace...

1028
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,870
We are classmates. Don't mention it.

1029
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:47,350
I can't let you off so easily.

1030
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:48,070
I saw you

1031
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:48,940
bring some snack.

1032
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,060
Chocolate, made in Switzerland.

1033
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:50,900
Give it to me.

1034
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,820
Here's my plan.
