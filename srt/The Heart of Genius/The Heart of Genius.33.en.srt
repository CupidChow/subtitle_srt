[Episode 33]

4
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,220
Lower your head and look at me.

5
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:39,870
Okay.

6
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,300
Good.

7
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,680
Very good. Come on.

8
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,220
Fix his makeup.

9
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,640
OK, let's continue.

10
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,140
Look at me.

11
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,320
Yes. Okay.

12
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,650
You think the current Pei Zhi

13
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,220
is Pei Zhi of the Cheese World? How is that possible?

14
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,210
The current Pei Zhi

15
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,580
doesn't know German at all.

16
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:08,660
Last time,

17
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,500
during the quiz competition,

18
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,620
he said he lost on purpose,

19
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,890
but he didn't discuss with me in advance.

20
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,290
Also,

21
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,120
I found this.

22
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:16,460
What is this?

23
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,640
It's a receipt from the German class of Jordan Foreign Languages.

24
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:20,930
And I've already called

25
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,090
to confirm.

26
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,660
He did learn German behind my back.

27
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:24,900
What does it have to do with the Cheese World

28
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,470
if he can speak German or not?

29
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,340
Do you remember that

30
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,180
I told you last time that

31
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,980
Pei Zhi wanted to go to

32
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:31,670
the Cheese World?

33
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,650
Anyway.

34
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,870
In the end, I went to the Cheese World

35
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,020
with him.

36
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,420
But that's not the point.

37
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,590
The point is that after I went there,

38
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,650
I found that Lin Zhaoxi's grades were

39
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,390
a total mess in high school.

40
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,020
In other words, I, in the Cheese World, may not know

41
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,410
the things I know here.

42
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,900
So Pei Zhi of the Cheese World

43
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,070
may not speak German.

44
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,300
Only Pei Zhi of the Cheese World

45
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,530
can't speak German.

46
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,070
I see.

47
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,380
What can I help you with?

48
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,290
I'm thinking

49
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,400
that if I'm right,

50
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,380
the time Pei Zhi was replaced

51
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,540
in the Strawberry World

52
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,340
must be

53
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,950
after the time we came back last time.

54
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,410
So I thought you could

55
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,620
test him

56
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,500
with what happened before.

57
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,600
Okay, no problem.

58
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,320
Thank you.

59
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:14,630
You're welcome.

60
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,840
My hands are itching these days.

61
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,829
I want to play basketball.

62
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,460
Friends in the circle

63
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,170
are either in Hengdian or in Xiangshan.

64
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,250
So, I thought of you.

65
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:28,880
No problem.

66
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:29,610
It's just that

67
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,570
I can't stay out too late tonight.

68
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,140
I want to go home and rest early.

69
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,329
Don't you have at least an hour?

70
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,980
Yes.

71
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,060
That's good.

72
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,780
I envy you.

73
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,250
I should have spent more money

74
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,570
to buy you off.

75
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,329
What money?

76
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,050
The money I gave you

77
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,800
for leaving Xi.

78
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,150
I won't do it no matter how much it is.

79
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,160
You never know.

80
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,120
Human nature

81
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,640
can't stand the test.

82
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,540
It's my fault.

83
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,860
I didn't have enough money in the card.

84
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,060
Do you remember how much money

85
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,730
I had in my card?

86
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,580
1,453,524

87
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:08,600
yuan.

88
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,410
It's still a lot.

89
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,010
You remember it so clearly.

90
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,190
My brain is

91
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,140
sensitive to numbers.

92
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,890
You knew it.

93
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,260
It seems to be about 1.4 million.

94
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,740
I can't remember the exact number.

95
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,300
You're the best.

96
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,600
Come.

97
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,390
You asked me to play basketball with you,

98
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,890
so this was the ball you wanted to play.

99
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,610
I thought about it.

100
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,050
I have a lot of work to do.

101
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,610
It'll be troublesome if I get hurt.

102
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,510
It's the same. It's fun.

103
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,560
I'm your playmate.

104
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,850
As long as you're happy.

105
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,140
You're a good friend. Come on.

106
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,460
Pei Zhi,

107
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,190
have you ever lied to anyone?

108
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,560
Why do you ask?

109
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,020
If a smart person like you

110
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:16,910
lies,

111
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,490
I'm sure no one will find out.

112
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,120
I've accepted a drama offer recently.

113
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,770
The protagonist is a liar.

114
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,230
According to the script,

115
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,600
he has to lie to others sincerely.

116
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,110
I don't understand

117
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,570
how can sincerity and deception

118
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,500
appear at the same time.

119
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,400
I can't act.

120
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,620
So I may not be able to

121
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,440
help you.

122
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,140
You've never lied?

123
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,390
Of course I told lies.

124
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,530
No one

125
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,730
can be 100% honest.

126
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,940
I'm not talking about how you act in the society.

127
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,890
Have you ever lied to your close friends?

128
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,890
For example, your mom,

129
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,920
Lin or Lin Zhaoxi.

130
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,460
If it's a white lie,

131
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:04,940
I will...

132
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,750
What is a white lie?

133
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,110
It means to make everyone

134
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,600
live a better life.

135
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:13,860
It seems that

136
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,160
you don't want to play games today.

137
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,320
I should go now.

138
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:17,850
No.

139
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,660
I just wanted

140
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,660
to talk to you.

141
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,600
Go on.

142
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,420
Go on.

143
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,890
Have you played basketball recently?

144
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,080
I played it once with Zhang Liang.

145
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:42,650
And last year,

146
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,100
when the master was not clear-headed,

147
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,040
I played with him in the court for a while.

148
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,300
Let's go out

149
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:49,880
for karaoke later.

150
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,310
I've been busy lately.

151
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:54,180
Can't you make time

152
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,570
for one night?

153
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,350
I really want to sing now.

154
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,740
Do you remember

155
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,460
you had a match with a Thai?

156
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,310
After that,

157
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,050
I sent you and Lin Zhaoxi back.

158
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,580
I was singing while driving.

159
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,880
What was I singing?

160
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,500
I'm on my beloved motorbike.

161
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,260
It will never get stuck in traffic.

162
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,540
Yes, that's it.

163
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:16,390
That's it.

164
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,470
You have a good memory.

165
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,660
You've always been like this.

166
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,720
See you next time. Bye.

167
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,540
Bye.

168
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,330
We can go now.

169
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,450
I just asked him a few questions.

170
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,970
I heard.

171
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,500
On the car here,

172
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,920
I asked a few questions too.

173
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,660
He answered perfectly.

174
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,660
He remembered the details better than me.

175
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,090
Are you

176
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,740
overthinking?

177
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,740
I met Pei Zhi again

178
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,409
after the first time

179
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,770
and before the second time I jumped.

180
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:36,740
Suppose he is already

181
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,390
Pei Zhi of the Cheese World,

182
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,070
then the second jump

183
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,590
doesn't make sense.

184
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,309
If Pei Zhi jumped,

185
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,140
it can only be

186
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,560
after the second time I jumped.

187
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,940
But his performance today

188
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,210
didn't make sense.

189
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,730
Did I overthink?

190
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,090
Xiaomeng, why are you here?

191
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,870
I brought you some fruits.

192
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,150
Why didn't you go in?

193
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,460
Is your dad home?

194
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,560
No one opened the door for me.

195
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,050
But there seems to be noise inside.

196
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:04,990
My dad is at home.

197
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,880
Come in.

198
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,940
Come in.

199
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:19,710
-Dad.
-Uncle LIn.

200
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,540
Why didn't you open the door?

201
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,230
Why didn't you...

202
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,570
Xiaomeng is here to see you.

203
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,800
Thief! I can't open the door for a thief!

204
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,220
Why could a thief knock?

205
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,520
Who knows?

206
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,740
What if she steal my thesis?

207
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:34,980
My thesis is so important.

208
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,620
Okay, I know.

209
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,940
The thesis has been published.

210
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,260
No one will take it away.

211
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,890
Don't worry.

212
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,550
Uncle Lin, my dad has been sentenced.

213
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,040
His punishment is not serious.

214
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,740
Thanks to your letter of understanding.

215
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,140
I'm here to thank you.

216
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,820
I've been studying veterinarian.

217
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,860
I signed up for an adult class.

218
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,720
I plan to open a pet hospital.

219
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,060
Pets have no rights either.

220
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,560
The doctors are not good enough.

221
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,130
I'll hire a vet.

222
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,380
I just want to learn

223
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,790
more professional knowledge.

224
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,030
Good.

225
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,360
Uncle Lin seems to be getting worse.

226
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:27,760
Xi.

227
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,540
If you need help,

228
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,910
just let me know.

229
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,820
I can help you.

230
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,180
I can handle it now.

231
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,630
That's good.

232
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,400
Where is Pei Zhi?

233
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,240
Isn't he staying at your house?

234
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,540
He went back to his mom's place.

235
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,750
He's been busy with school recently.

236
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,050
It's closer from there.

237
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,260
I thought

238
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,900
something happened between you two.

239
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,700
No.

240
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,800
What? Am I right?

241
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,480
Not really.

242
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,280
I realized that

243
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,260
he's been acting strange lately.

244
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,490
Did he treat you badly?

245
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,260
No, no.

246
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,220
He treats me quite well.

247
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,180
But I don't know.

248
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,100
Maybe he's busy.

249
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,370
As long as he's nice to you,

250
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,130
don't think too much.

251
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,470
Speaking of which,

252
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,020
there's something

253
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,290
a little strange.

254
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:27,910
About Pei Zhi?

255
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,110
On the day of your competition,

256
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,140
I came to your house to deliver fish.

257
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,740
I saw him outside

258
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,270
mixing cement with a spade.

259
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,150
Pei Zhi.

260
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,960
Xiaomeng, why are you here?

261
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,350
You're here too?

262
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,490
Xi said you were busy.

263
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,100
What are you doing?

264
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,370
Don't tell anyone

265
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,060
about what happened today.

266
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,890
I'm afraid if she finds out,

267
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,910
she'll blame me for meddling again.

268
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,770
He mended here.

269
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,210
What are you looking at?

270
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,020
I'm not sure.

271
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,150
There's something in the wall.

272
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,130
-Dad.
-Uncle Lin.

273
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:47,610
Dad, why are you here?

274
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,220
There's something in the wall.

275
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:48,860
How did you know

276
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:49,980
there's something in the wall?

277
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,860
Did you put something in the wall?

278
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,580
Did you put it there?

279
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,910
I don't remember.

280
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,240
You don't remember?

281
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:01,870
Do you remember

282
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,980
what you put?

283
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,330
Something important.

284
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,800
I can't remember.

285
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:06,960
Something important?

286
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,380
Forget it if you can't remember.

287
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,930
I'll ask Pei Zhi for you.

288
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,140
I'll see if he knows.

289
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:12,420
Okay?

290
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,060
Why can't I remember?

291
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:13,780
Forget it.

292
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,700
Uncle Lin, calm down. Uncle Lin.

293
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,230
Let's go home first, okay?

294
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:16,960
It's very important.

295
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,630
I know.

296
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,820
I'll help you find it.

297
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,740
Yes, you help me find it.

298
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:20,340
It's very important.

299
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,510
Xiaomeng, go home first.

300
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,670
It's important.

301
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,360
I can't remember.

302
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,010
Be careful.

303
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,090
Sit there. Dad, be careful.

304
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,460
Xiaomeng, please

305
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,560
take care of my dad for me.

306
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,460
I need to go out.

307
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,190
Okay, don't worry.

308
00:13:59,100 --> 00:13:59,910
I'm leaving.

309
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,500
Go ahead.

310
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,220
Thank you.

311
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,460
Did I calculate this number just now?

312
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:28,220
Yes.

313
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,580
Mom, I was watching.

314
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,270
1,446.

315
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,300
1,446.

316
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,650
Xi, why are you here?

317
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,990
Come in.

318
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,000
What did you take

319
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,170
from the wall?

320
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:51,610
Mom.

321
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:53,950
I need to go out.

322
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:56,440
Go ahead.

323
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,340
400.

324
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,230
Have you figured out how to answer me?

325
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,880
It's a letter.

326
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:29,920
What letter?

327
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,840
A letter from your mom.

328
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,630
A letter from my mom?

329
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,100
Why didn't you tell me?

330
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:40,760
Because I don't know

331
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,670
how to explain.

332
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,160
Explain what?

333
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,940
Explain how you know

334
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,860
there's a letter in the wall?

335
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,450
Yes.

336
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,460
So why?

337
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,590
I guessed it.

338
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,990
Why did you take it away?

339
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:52,980
Because I need it

340
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,520
to do something for me.

341
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,030
Are you Pei Zhi from the Cheese World?

342
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,640
Why do you ask?

343
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,890

when the results came out.

855
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,980
So she chose to

856
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:26,050
give up the college entrance exam

857
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,100
in an extreme way.

858
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,170
You've got the cast.

859
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:51,700
You can't move at your will.

860
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:53,090
You need calcium supplement.

861
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,140
Take more calcium pills

862
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:54,850
and rest.

863
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,900
Got it?

864
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,170
It's okay, Xi.

865
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,810
Eat something.

866
00:40:58,940 --> 00:40:59,940
I'm eating.

867
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,400
Eat.

868
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,200
Eat.

869
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:01,930
Eat.

870
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:02,940
No, you guys eat.

871
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:03,500
You brought them to my house.

872
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,020
We'll watch you eat.

873
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,830
We have guests.

874
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:06,840
Good girl.

875
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,580
If you fail this year,

876
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,220
you can take it next year.

877
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,090
That's right.

878
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:10,850
It doesn't matter.

879
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,300
Maybe the test paper next year

880
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,240
will be easier than that of this year.

881
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:13,800
We'll talk about it later.

882
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:14,220
Yes.

883
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:15,230
It doesn't matter.

884
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,810
It's like I didn't take the exam.

885
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,500
How can you compare to her?

886
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,610
I know what you're thinking.

887
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:24,660
She won't come back.

888
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,440
Accept the reality.

889
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,860
They are all my daughters.

890
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:30,830
I don't want to see

891
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,140
any of them sad.

892
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,300
You can accompany her to study for another year.

893
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,020
That's right.

894
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:38,010
That's right. I...

895
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:39,110
Promise me.

896
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,930
Be good to Xi,

897
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,660
our Xi.

898
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:48,760
Everyone thought

899
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,770
it was an accident.

900
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,460
Only the master and I know the truth.

901
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:57,090
I'm sorry.

902
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:00,960
For what?

903
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,260
My hand?

904
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,270
It's not your fault.

905
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:09,860
I'll help you with your study.

906
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,440
Next year,

907
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:12,500
you will get into the university of your dreams.

908
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,460
There is no need.

909
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:15,860
You don't have to blame yourself.

910
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:16,990
You know what?

911
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,540
I feel very relaxed

912
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,130
and free now.

913
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:22,100
Maybe I should have been cruel

914
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,140
to myself,

915
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:24,440
like in the welfare home.

916
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,360
The more cruel you treat yourself, the more you can get.

917
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,170
What do you think?
