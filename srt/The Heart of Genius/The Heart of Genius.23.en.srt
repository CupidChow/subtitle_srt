4
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,660
I didn't expect that we would make it.

5
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,539
But the time error

6
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,039
was a little big, right?

7
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:43,979
Maybe we neglected

8
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,190
the psychological change of the thief.

9
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,890
After he succeeded,

10
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:48,030
he was nervous

11
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,320
when he was near the crime scene,

12
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,460
so he rode pretty fast.

13
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,340
But after he rode a certain distance,

14
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:53,340
he felt relaxed,

15
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,440
so he slowed down.

16
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:55,770
This is what we didn't think of.

17
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,580
I think there was one more thing.

18
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,490
When we were setting

19
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,690
the program,

20
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,140
we always set that

21
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,170
the thief wouldn't follow traffic rules.

22
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,730
But now,

23
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,390
it seems that he might be waiting for

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,660
the green light at every intersection

25
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,690
for fear that the traffic policemen

26
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,240
might punish him.

27
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:14,880
Hello, dad.

28
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,140
I have good news for you.

29
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,050
I have got

That you guys caught the thief

was well known.

34
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,329
The higher-ups

35
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,180
were very interested in the program.

36
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,890
They wanted your code.

37
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,550
I

38
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:35,020
took the chance to ask for

39
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,079
the traffic data of a year

40
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,860
and using city surveillance one day

41
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,579
for testing.

42
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,130
Director Wang agreed.

43
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,400
Can you give your code

44
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,020
to the traffic police?

45
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:47,710
Yes.

47
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,530
Hello, uncle.

48
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,920
I asked my colleague who was in charge of the surveillance

49
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,900
to make the escape route

50
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:57,730
of the thief

51
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:58,980
into a video.

52
00:02:59,250 --> 00:02:59,660
I don't know

53
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,450
whether it is useful for you.

54
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:01,660
It is useful.

55
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,770
We were going to have a review.

56
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,850
It's better to have a video.

57
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,340
It is good that it is useful.

58
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,670
I'll bring it to you tonight.

59
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,650

You go to school every day

64
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,760
and you haven't been trained systematically.

65
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,210
What's more, your weight is much less than mine.

66
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,150
But you can fight like this.

No. I still have a long way to go.

70
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,380
I'm just a little faster

71
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,340
than others in terms of reaction capability.

76

but the talent

can't be trained.

00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,700
or cancer.

176
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,360
Then why did you say that

177
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,520
your dad was going to die?

178
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,860
Maybe I used improper words.

179
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,090
Let me put it another way.

180
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,140
If one day

181
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,970
I do something wrong

182
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,420
that upsets you,

183
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,460
what should I do

184
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,620
to make you a little happier?

185
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,840
Son, don't

186
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,850
commit crimes.

187
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,210
Mom, I think

188
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,250
you should keep practicing yoga.

189
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:41,890
I think you are happy

190
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,560
when you practice yoga.

191
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,380
I'll leave you alone.

192
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,780
Son, make it clear.

193
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,280
What happened?

194
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:06,810

Why are you here?

199
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,560
I just want to ask you

200
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,540
whether you will come back to school.

201
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:10,290
I will.

202
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,900
But we are busy right now.

203
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,140
Pei Zhi and I will go back after a while.

204
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,300
That's good.

205
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,700
Everyone is worried about you.

206
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,520
There are rumors about you at school.

207
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,260
Some even say you're pregnant.

208
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,980
They are so mean.

209
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,110
I...

210
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,850
Forget it.

211
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:27,420
When I go back to school,

212
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,300
the rumors will collapse themselves.

213
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,980
Xiaomeng has not been doing well recently.

214
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,290
She seems to give up on the college entrance exam.

215
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,460
What's wrong with her?

216
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:38,970
She said that

217
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:40,570
we were not

218
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,750
in the same world.

219
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,140
She also said that

220
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,020
you would feel embarrassed

221
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,450
to have friends like us.

222
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,790
I don't think so.

223
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,990
Actually, I know she wants to learn.

224
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,010
But she has missed too many lessons.

225
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,180
She doesn't know where to start.

226
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,700
But I'm no better

227
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,740
than her.

228
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,320
I can only let my dad spend more money

229
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,370
and let me learn in a third-tier university.

230
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,140
Xi,

231
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,420
do you have any

232
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,480
learning tips?

233
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:08,550
I...

234
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,790
I don't expect to be one of the top students

235
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,700
in the grade like you.

236
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,460
It's enough for me

237
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,020
to reach the admission line of second-tier universities.

238
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,220
Learning tips?

239
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,060
I don't have any tips.

240
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:24,540
I see.

241
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,950
You're just smart.

242
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,060
As long as you work harder,

243
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,710
you'll get it.

244
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,540
Maybe Xiaomeng was right.

245
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,430
From now on,

246
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,660
we will be in two different worlds.

247
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:37,730

Let's go.

256
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,700
You know what? I can hardly bear to leave.

257
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,420
These days,

258
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:23,960
I felt isolated from the world.

259
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,070
Although I was tired,

260
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,620
I felt quite calm inside.

261
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,040
Now, the program is done.

262
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,460
We still have some time left.

263
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,500
What are you going to do?

264
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,410
Actually, there is really one thing.

265
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,670
I've been thinking that after I left,

266
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,140
Lin Zhaoxi in the Cheese World

267
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,010
will return to her original state.

268
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,770
It's less than half a year before the college entrance exam.

269
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,760
How can she study?

270
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,970
So you want to help

271
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,630
Lin Zhaoxi in the Cheese World.

272
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,380

273
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,330
what I'm doing

274
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,220
now,

275
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,420
I can learn

276
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,320
the stuff in high school once again.

277
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,850
It is like I learn it for her.

278
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,010
I can also set up

279
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,400
a study group.

280
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,640
I will also invite Xiaomeng, Tianming, and Qi.

281
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,740
It can be counted as a contribution I make to

283

285
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,250
What's wrong?

286
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,270
Nothing.

287
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:14,660
Let's go.

288
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,100
It's perfect.

289
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,100
Hello, Lin Zhaoxi in the Cheese World.

290
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,260
I've checked your paper.

291
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,690
Your Chinese and English

292
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,750
are not bad.

293
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,750
The major problem is in math.

294
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,830
Your foundation is weak.

295
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,730
But it's okay.

296
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,320
We still have three months.

297
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:42,910
Next,

298
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,820
we can go through

299
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,480
the knowledge of

300
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,550
math in high school.

301
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,780
It's not like

302
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,370
math in the university.

303
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,200
So relax.

304
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,960
It seems that I'm doing a live stream.

305
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,460
So I choose to record

306
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,460
a video.

307
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,910
If you

308
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,260
have any questions then,

309
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,940
just come back and watch the video.

310
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,420
Today we will mainly

311
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,420
learn the sequence.

312
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,070
It should be...

313
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:08,970
What are you doing?

314
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:09,980
Who are you talking to?

315
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:13,140
I'm talking.

316
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,490
I'm teaching your daughter math.

317
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:18,660
I see.

318
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,180
Wait a minute.

319
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:19,860
I'll call Hua Juan.

320
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,700
One more student.

321
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:26,830
Wait a minute.

322
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,000
Don't block the shot.

323
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:32,820
Okay.

324
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,660
We

325
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,590
have one more student now,

326
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,370
Hua Juan.

327
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,120
Then,

328
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,250
let's start the class together.

329
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,000
Okay.

330
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,370
Let's look at the example of the first question

331
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,210
about the sequence.

332
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,360
Sister, what are you doing?

333
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:45,850
I...

334
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:47,860
Don't care about this.

335
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,060
Just look carefully and focus on your studies.

336
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:49,540
Understand?

337
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,980
Your academic scores

338
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,660
are not safe.

339
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,960
Increase as much as you can.

340
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,450
Okay, let's look at the example first.

341
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,140
So,

342
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,740
in sequences,

343
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,830
the variable of the first part

344
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,940
is the number of terms.

345
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,680
There are the first, the second,

346
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,000
the third and the N term.

347
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,820
The other variable...

348
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:09,880
Sister,

349
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:11,790
I...

350
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,790
I want some water.

351
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:15,950
Okay, go ahead.

352
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,190
Bring it here for me.

353
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,240
I'm thirsty too.

354
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,250
Take a rest.

355
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,460
Dad.

356
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,820
Dad, go and have a look.

357
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,970
Something is wrong with my sister.

358
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,460
What's wrong?

359
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,780
She is facing a digital camera

360
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,570
and is talking nonsense

361
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,820
to herself

362
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,580
as if she's crazy.

363
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,470
It's not crazy.

364
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,700
Your sister is urging herself.

365
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:35,900
That's

366
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,170
a new learning method.

367
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,900
I taught her.

368
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,500
Just learn from her.

369
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,310
Don't ask anything else.

370
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,960
What learning method is this?

371
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,540
This is called

372
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,550
a one-on-one cross-time education.

373
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,330
Dad,

374
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,250
I think you're bluffing.

375
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,470
Why should I?

376
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,190
Otherwise, you can learn from me.

377
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,290
I can practice teaching with you.

378
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,000
No need.

379
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:00,840
Come on. Hurry up.

380
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,540
Let's start from the knowledge you learned in middle school.

381
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,780
Your foundation is not good.

382
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,660
Dad, I suddenly felt that

383
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,420
the one-on-one cross-time education

384
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,020
is very good.

385
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,540
I'm going back to study.

386
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:11,930
Aren't you coming?

387
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,970
No, no.

388
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,880
Let's start.

389
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:27,740
OK.

390
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,250
Let's talk about

391
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,160
high school English today.

392
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,630
To be honest,

393
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,920
high school English

394
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,650
is the simplest subject.

395
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,020
It is divided into two parts,

396
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,680
grammar and vocabulary.

397
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,620
There are only

398
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,050
more than ten parts of grammar.

399
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,160
I'll make a list

400
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:42,800
and teach you later.

401
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,500
Let's talk about memorizing words today.

402
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,220
Isn't memorizing words just rote learning?

403
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,720
I can't even remember them by rote.

404
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,700
I can't remember words at all.

405
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,460
How do you usually recite it?

406
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,860
Just memorize it.

407
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,790
Read Chinese and write it down.

408
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,420
In exams, there are only choice questions.

409
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,710
Who ask you to write words?

410
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,130
The composition.

411
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,720
There are all words in the composition.

412
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,579
But you don't need to use high-end words.

413
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,420
In the composition, we just need to use the basic words we learned

414
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,520
in middle school or even elementary school.

415
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,200
They are simple oral words.

416
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,050
Then you can use some sentences like

417
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,630
"Just like each coin

418
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,339
has two sides..."

419
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,310
and other auspicious words

420
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:14,980
like this.

421
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:17,710
What's the meaning of "Just like..."?

422
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,300
I don't even know that.

423
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:20,270
It's okay.

424
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:23,450
In reading comprehension

425
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,730
and cloze,

426
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,619
it is enough that you

427
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,290
understand

428
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:26,869
the meaning of the words.

429
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:28,099
You don't need to

430
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,060
write down the English words while you are looking at the Chinese meaning.

431
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,920
Like some words,

432
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,600
is it important to remember whether it is an "o" or "e" in the middle?

433
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,520
For example,

434
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,620
when the Chinese characters are linked together,

435
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,280
even if there is a wrong character,

436
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:36,980
you'll know

437
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,940
what the sentence means.

438
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,020
Most of the time

439
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,280
it is enough to understand the meaning.

440
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,340
When you memorize the words,

441
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,800
cover its Chinese part

442
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:43,700
and ask yourself,

443
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:44,730
what does this English word

444
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,480
mean?

445
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,470
Then compare with the Chinese meaning.

446
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,470
It's very efficient.

447
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:49,850
It makes sense.

448
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,060
But this is just

449
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:52,940
a quick method.

450
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:53,890
You can improve your grades

451
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:54,960
in a short time

452
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,850
in exams.

453
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:56,900
The upper limit is not high.

454
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,590
What I need is the quick method.

455
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,300
What I need is to pass the exam.

456
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,170
What I need is to be close to passing the exam.

457
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,020
Xiaomeng.

458
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,240
Wait for me.

459
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,440
What's wrong with Xiaomeng lately?

460
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,510
You boys won't understand.

461
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,500
Cover the Chinese.

462
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:28,130
[Education is an important cornerstone]

463
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:28,130
[of national revitalization and social progress]

464
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,130
Xiaomeng.

465
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:28,740
Xiao...

466
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:31,710
Xiaomeng.

467
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,200
Xiaomeng.

468
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:36,660
Xiaomeng.

469
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:38,650
Xiaomeng.

470
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,660
Xiaomeng, let's talk.

471
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,970
Why are you chasing me?

472
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,460
Why are you running?

473
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,340
Listen to me.

474
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,220
I've set up a study group.

475
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,060
Join us.

476
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,490
Let's work hard together, okay?

477
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,350
Does working hard mean anything to me?

478
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:01,810
Yes.

479
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,980
And I know you want to learn too.

480
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,170
I don't want to learn.

481
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,240
You want to learn.

482
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,500
I don't want to learn.

483
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,220
You want to learn.

484
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,750
I don't want to learn.

485
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,100
If I can't go to college,

486
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,540
I will be a waitress.

487
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,090
You are so smart.

488
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,140
You definitely do not know

489
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:18,760
how tiring it is

490
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,820
for me, an idiot, to learn.

491
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,160
I can never get it.

492
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,530
What can I do?

493
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,180
There are many ways.

494
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,340
I can teach you.

495
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,300
Come on.

496
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,840
Lin Zhaoxi,

497
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:31,980
you...

498
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,060
are over there.

499
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,020
You just come down

500
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,100
to play with me for a while.

501
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,030
After that,

502
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,440
you'll go back.

503
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:44,640
And I...

504
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,130
I am always here.

505
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,710
Please tell me.

506
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,460
It's hard for me

507
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,800
to walk on the ground.

508
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,460
How can I

509
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,130
catch up with you who are high in the sky?

510
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,670
What does that matter?

511
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,040
Just like

512
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,920
I was wondering

513
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,230
how to

514
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,690
catch up with Pei Zhi.

515
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,300
But even if we can't,

516
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,530

This is a surprise

1026
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:21,960
prepared for you.

1027
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,450
Are you sure it's not because a kid

1028
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,290
dislikes me?

1029
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,460
I'll prepare another surprise for you.

1030
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,060
What's that look?

1031
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:30,170
Doesn't that look like yours?

1032
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:32,140
It is not like me. I'm so cool.

1033
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,280
Dad,

1034
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,780
it's nice to see you so healthy.

1035
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,380
But people

1036
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,540
have to face difficulties.

1037
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,340
Does the parallel world you said

1038
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:45,420
mean escaping?

1039
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,300
Haven't you had a moment when

1040
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:49,740
you were helpless

1041
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:51,300
and didn't know what to do?

1042
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:52,510
I have.

1043
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,500
When?

1044
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,980
When I knew

1045
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,290
I had a daughter...
