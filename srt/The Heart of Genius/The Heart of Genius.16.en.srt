[Episode 16]

4
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,810
Most importantly,

5
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,560
Ji Jiang has become my brother.

6
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,570
What happened?

7
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,150
I don't know.

8
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,560
Maybe it's the result

9
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,060
of our previous stay.

10
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,340
But I'm thinking

11
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,470
that in the Strawberry World,

12
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,580
Hua Juan has started

13
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,370
to be in commercials

14
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:54,920
and has become popular at this time.

15
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:55,590
But now,

16
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,700
he has nothing.

17
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,960
He still likes singing.

18
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,220
He even wants to participate in the singing competition.

19
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,460
How about

20
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,250
we talk about it

21
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,390
at school tomorrow?

22
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,660
Your parents are there, right?

23
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,420
Okay, I'll tell you at school tomorrow.

24
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,760
Okay, bye.

25
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:13,840
Bye.

26
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:25,310
Dad.

27
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,250
Come on, let's play cards.

28
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,010
What did Lin Zhaoxi want from you?

29
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,600
We were just chatting.

30
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,200
Are you going to play this round?

31
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,390
Yes.

32
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,260
Catch the landlord!

33
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,900
After two years,

34
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,540
the Super Singer is coming again.

35
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,440
From now on,

36
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,860
this music reality show

37
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,100
which created

38
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,980
idol singers

39
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,820
like Song Zihou and Lu Wen,

40
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,300
will start its audition.

41
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,480
Yesterday afternoon,

42
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:57,740
the director of Super Singer, Jiang Dongmei,

43
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,660
was interviewed.

44
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,690
Get up. Get up. Get up.

45
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,810
You're late. Get up.

46
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,750
I won't heat up the milk.

47
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,510
Drink the cold milk.

48
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,390
What time is it?

49
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,780
It's 6:30. Hurry. We're late.

50
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,940
Sister, what's wrong with you?

51
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,290
It's your turn to make breakfast today.

52
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,370
You got up late again.

53
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,420
Hurry up and eat.

54
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,460
Come on.

55
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,950
Have you packed your bag?

56
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:21,960
No.

57
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,040
No? Go and pack your bag.

58
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,400
Go. Leave after you finish eating.

59
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,170
Hurry up.

60
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,070
Have you brushed your teeth and washed your face?

61
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,560
No.

62
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:31,820
Go and brush your teeth. Hurry up.

63
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,660
Be quick. We're late.

64
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,140
Hurry up and finish eating.

65
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,500
I'm not full yet.

66
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,600
Hurry up.

67
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,910
I'll take you to the bus stop after you're done.

68
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:42,100
Hurry up. Go.

69
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,570
Where's your motorcycle?

70
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,810
I sold it.

71
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,110
Didn't you say it's not safe?

72
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,260
Come on.

73
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,990
Yes, hold the big seat.

74
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,280
-This is good too.
-Let's go.

75
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,650
Dad, aren't you

76
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,750
too slow?

77
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:17,760
Am I slow?

78
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:18,920
Aren't you slow?

79
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,550
Let's compete later.

80
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,240
You take the bus and I ride.

81
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:22,840
Let's see who arrives first.

82
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,270
Can you drive faster?

83
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:26,900
I...

84
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,070
How about I run over there?

85
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,910
No, no, no.

86
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,630
It's dangerous.

87
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,700
I'll speed up.

88
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,790
Did you speed up?

89
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:33,580
Yes.

90
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,740
The bus is leaving.

91
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,670
Look at my speed.

92
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,450
Look.

93
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,420
It's speeding up.

94
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,430
We're here. Don't worry.

95
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,750
We're here.

96
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,380
Hurry up.

97
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:41,230
We're here.

98
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,460
It has left.

99
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:45,659
It has left.

100
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,190
Did you ride so slowly on purpose?

101
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,780
Am I that childish?

102
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,060
The game begins.

103
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,500
Childish.

104
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:19,460
Good morning.

105
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,180
Good morning.

106
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,520
How did you get here?

107
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,210
I took the bus.

108
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,190
I came by bus too.

109
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,170
I was exhausted from running.

110
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,410
I rode my bike here.

111
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:29,660
Go on. Take me with you.

112
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,110
Sorry, sir.

113
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,550
I haven't been to school for so long.

114
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,409
Be quiet.

115
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,480
Hua Juan has become my brother.

116
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,360
But now,

117
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,640
he's still a poor student.

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,790
But in the Strawberry World, Hua Juan

119
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,440
has started to be in commercials

120
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,080
and has become popular at this time.

121
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,220
I guess this is the change

122
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,870
I brought to the world for the first time I came here.

123
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,270
Without Professor Ji’s help,

124
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,460
his future is in doubt.

125
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,590
If he can't become a star,

126
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,690
it will be all my fault.

127
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,060
The teacher is coming.

128
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,040
Every world

129
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,150
has its own unique running rules.

130
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,420
Chatting.

131
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,190
You kept chatting after I left.

132
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,380
The teacher left.

133
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,580
Senior high school students are suffering.

134
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,620
I have found

135
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,500
that feeling.

136
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:08,920
I think it's good

137
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,040
to have fun in bitterness.

138
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,680
He drew a picture for himself.

139
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,660
I feel guilty.

140
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,270
Just like the one on it,

141
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,370
he marked the land and the bridge.

142
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,330
Then he put a dot.

143
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,710
For Hua Juan.

144
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,340
He connected each of these areas.

145
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,850
Maybe it will be better

146
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,010
for Hua Juan to take part in talent shows.

147
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,030
I don't think so.

148
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:54,220
Lin Zhaoxi.

149
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:55,620
Stand up.

150
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,150
Look at you.

151
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,860
You've become a bad student.

152
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,480
But you still don't work hard.

153
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,280
You should focus in class.

154
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,140
Read the second part

155
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:10,810
of Part 3 for me.

156
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,510
If you stutter a little,

157
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:14,840
stand until the class is over.

158
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,620
If a figure

159
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,540
has more than two odd points,

160
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,190
you cannot go over it

161
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,140
without lifting your pencil from the page

162
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,910
or going over a line twice.

163
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,020
Quickly he went to his textbooks

164
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,059
to find some more figures.

165
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,870
He looked at the four diagrams...

166
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,460
Okay, be quiet.

167
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,930
Pay attention to the lecture.

168
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,530
Don't play any tricks.

169
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,520
Sit down.

170
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,590
Okay, let's continue.

171
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,120
Do you still have the recorder?

172
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,560
I want to listen to it a few more times.

173
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,330
Here.

174
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,620
Thank you.

175
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,390
Take it.

176
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,470
I've memorized

177
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,380
all the details.

178
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:18,100
Don't worry. I'll definitely take you back.

179
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,110
Xi.

180
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,390
What do you think of

181
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,350
the life

182
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:33,850
in this Cheese World?

183
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:35,840
Pretty good.

184
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,610
Your dad and my dad

185
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,680
are healthy.

186
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,180
The superstar, Hua Juan is here.

187
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,920
He is also my brother.

188
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:43,950
Do you know

189
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,020
what's the best?

190
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,020
We are

191
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,850
a pair of

192
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,600
well-known mysterious deskmates.

193
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,700
We can also be legends

194
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,600
of Experimental High School.

195
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,000
Have you ever thought

196
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:01,850
that it would be good

197
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,320
for us

198
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,910
to live in this world?

199
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,270
We're from the Strawberry World.

200
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,460
Why should we stay here?

201
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,620
Why not?

202
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,300
I mean,

203
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,380
since we can

204
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,250
come to this world,

205
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:18,550
we have

206
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,040
one more chance than other people

207
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,200
to choose our lives.

208
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,910
All our important family members

209
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,780
are here.

210
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,680
And most importantly,

211
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,140
you and I are still together.

212
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:27,840
We can go

213
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,100
to Sanwei University to study maths.

214
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:31,920
What we lost

215
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:32,960
in the Strawberry World

216
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,660
can be found here.

217
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,620
I don't understand

218
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,550
there's a choice question

219
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,250
with a standard answer.

220
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:36,670
Why should we

221
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,720
choose a wrong one?

222
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,710
Listen to me, Pei Zhi.

223
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,380
Yes, this world is wonderful.

224
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,130
But if there are rocks in our socks,

225
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,190
what we need to do is

226
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:45,950
taking the stones out

227
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,300
instead of changing the shoes.

228
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,600
My dad

229
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,380
is the sick Lin.

230
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,120
He needs me.

231
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,070
I can't lose him.

232
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,580
I know what it feels to lose him.

233
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,030
I've known it since I was young.

234
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:05,620
Xi.

235
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:08,940
If you let me

236
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,100
return to the Strawberry World,

237
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,740
that means

238
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,940
I need to lose my father again.

239
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,960
I'm not brave enough

240
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,870
to see my dad

241
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,460
disappear twice in front of me.

242
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,860
We still have time.

243
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,690
Let's think about it again.

244
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:31,770
Okay?

245
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,540
Now let's look at this question.

246
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,750
The common ratio is 2.

247
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,300
The summation of first five terms, S5, is 1.

248
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,910
Calculate the summation of first ten items, S10.

249
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,590
You can use this formula.

250
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,860
S5 equals

251
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,540
1 minus a1/q multiply by 1 minus the fifth power of q.

252
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:51,030
The answer is 1.

253
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,520
Pei Zhi's father is a traffic police.

254
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,120
But in the Strawberry World,

255
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,830
his father passed away

256
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:56,490
when he was in junior high school.

257
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,790
Studying maths deeply

258
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,820
will trigger my illness.

259
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,620
I'm a patient.

260
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,350
I don't know how to face you.

261
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,330
Cognitive disorder

262
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,680
is one of the most difficult problems

263
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,270
in the diagnosis and treatment

264
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,740
of diseases of the brain.

265
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,120
Many patients with cognitive disorders

266
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,780
don't know their family members anymore.

267
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,320
I'm going to resign.

268
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,130
I'm going to study maths.

269
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,880
I'll find Pei Zhi

270
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,960
and tell him I love him.

271
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,760
Even if he might reject me,

272
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,740
I will take good care of you

273
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,770
and myself.

274
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,190
If you don't want him to die,

275
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,740
don't let him study maths.

276
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:39,890
So we can calculate

277
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,180
a1 is 1/31.

278
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,650
The common ratio is two

279
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,370
and a1 is 1/31.

280
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:45,510
We'll take them together into the formula.

281
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,970
So, S10 is

282
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,310
33.

283
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,300
Sorry, we have to go back.

284
00:12:59,400 --> 00:12:59,910
Guys,

285
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,500
it's lunch break.

286
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,320
There will be a basketball game in the afternoon.

287
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,960
I hope the players can

288
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:05,580
do their best.

289
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,040
But be careful with the safety.

290
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,170
Don't get hurt.

291
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:09,510
Come on.

292
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,980
Cheer for the players.

293
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,270
Class 13 will win!

294
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,900
Class 13 will win!

295
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,690
Class 13 will win!

296
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,350
Class 13 will win!

297
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,370
Class 13 will win!

298
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:21,900
Class is over.

299
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:22,660
Stand up.

300
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,150
Goodbye, teacher.

301
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,290
I see.

302
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,220
Let's go, Pei Zhi.

303
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,970
We'll discuss tactics while having lunch.

304
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:37,660
Let's go.

305
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,040
How are we going to have lunch?

306
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:43,560
Xiaomeng.

307
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,520
Let's go, Qi.

308
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,350
Let's have lunch.

309
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,640
You are no longer

310
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,870
a member of our trio.

311
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,910
Go eat by yourself.

312
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,350
Unless you agree

313
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,930
to be one of the cheerleaders again,

314
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:56,480
you'll have the chance

315
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,520
to have lunch with us.

316
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,450
Come on, Xiaomeng.

317
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:01,890
Give me some time.

318
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,580
We are such good friends.

319
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:06,800
You must know me too.

320
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,210
If I don't want to do it,

321
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,620
there must be the reason

322
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,850
I don't want to do it.

323
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,000
What's the reason?

324
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,890
I had heatstroke that day.

325
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,810
As you can see,

326
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:15,860
my physical condition

327
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:16,970
very bad now.

328
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,730
I will faint as soon as I get on that stage.

329
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,090
Forget it.

330
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,410
You tried to take me

331
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,720
to climb over the school gate yesterday.

332
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,260
Lin Zhaoxi.

333
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,220
Stop making excuses.

334
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,210
You started this.

335
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,270
Are you afraid of embarrassing yourself now?

336
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,380
Yes, I am.

337
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,420
But

338
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,270
I don't have time to announce

339
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,740
that my naive teenage period is over.

340
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,570
Let me tell you this.

341
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,820
In puberty,

342
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,830
people tend to be emotional

343
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,070
and do something impulsively.

344
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,230
But if you think back

345
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,010
these things

346
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:46,950
when you grow up,

347
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,930
you'll very embarrassed.

348
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,210
You'll even want to slap yourselves.

349
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,560
Oh my god.

350
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,010
Lin Zhaoxi.

351
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,580
Are you really

352
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,680
at the same age as us?

353
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,210
You look

354
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,560
like my cousin in her 20s

355
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,540
who has never been in a relationship.

356
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,390
You've been acting strange

357
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,930
after you had heatstroke that day.

358
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,490
You used to

359
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,870
to join in the fun.

360
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,640
When you pursued Zheng Tianming,

361
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,220
you were even more shameless than me.

362
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,630
You think we will lose our faces

363
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,040
after just one day?

364
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,660
Fine.

365
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,290
We're not good enough for you.

366
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,630
Go eat by yourself.

367
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,020
Let's go.

368
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,130
She seems to be reflecting on herself.

369
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,500
Should we give her another chance?

370
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,420
Why are you back?

371
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,300
I'll give you another chance.

372
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,170
Do you want to join us?

373
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,610
Or I'll tell Uncle Lin

374
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,750
that Zhaoxi and Xiaoxiao

375
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,940
are eager to buy milk tea for Zheng Tianming.

376
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,610
Dear Xiaomeng.

377
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,560
Well.

378
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,210
Consider it as your payment

379
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,180
for helping me take care of Lin.

380
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,340
I'll go, okay?

381
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,560
Great.

382
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,260
We'll teach you again.

383
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:09,350
Hurry up.

384
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,580
-Let's eat in the canteen.
-Help me, Qi.

385
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,120
Let's go.

386
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:13,970
Wait.

387
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,510
When did I take care of Uncle Lin?

388
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,870
-Come on! Come on!
-Good job!

389
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,540
Class 1 will lose!

390
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,290
Class 1 will lose!

391
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,390
Come on! Come on! Come on!

392
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,940
Come on! Come on! Come on!

393
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,260
Zhang Liang is so handsome.

394
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,320
Don't worry.

395
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,040
Are you crazy?

396
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,590
Are you insane?

397
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,220
What are you doing?

398
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:55,830
Who are you?

399
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,580
Come on!

400
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,650
Zhang Liang, come on!

401
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,880
Zhang Liang, come on!

402
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,900
Come on, Class 13!

403
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,980
Zheng Tianming is more handsome!

404
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,329
Zheng Tianming is more handsome!

405
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:12,900
Zhang Liang is so handsome! Zhang Liang is more handsome!

406
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,800
Zheng Tianming is the most handsome!

407
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:17,790
Zhang Liang is handsome,

408
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:18,579
smart,

409
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:19,270
and good at playing basketball.

410
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,750
He isn't like you guys who are bad at

411
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,970
studying and playing basketball.

412
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:27,859
What are you talking about?

413
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,260
It's enough.

414
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,070
Watch the game.

415
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,220
We are students. What do you mean?

416
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,260
I mean the literal meaning.

417
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,270
Take a break.

418
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,620
Baby, let's go.

419
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,120
Gather around.

420
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:42,680
Great!

421
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,520
Gather around. Gather around.

422
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:44,930
Now we are behind in the score.

423
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:45,610
But it's okay.

424
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,270
We can catch up.

425
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,600
Let's keep an eye on them. Stay calm.

426
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,410
They can't win.

427
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,080
Get the score back.

428
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,300
Leave more space and let me make three-point shots.

429
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:50,790
Okay?

430
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,820
Come on. Three, two, one.

431
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:53,520
Class 13.

432
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,460
Come on! Come on! Come on!

433
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,970
Come on! Come on!

434
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,570
Catch up with them.

435
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,390
Come on.

436
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,670
Xiaomeng.

437
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:05,940
Qi.

438
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,050
Listen.

439
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:08,580
Let's

440
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,140
wear these later.

441
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,150
What are these?

442
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,400
These are masks.

443
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,180
Let's dance with them.

444
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,240
Look.

445
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,150
Am I cute?

446
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,120
That's the cutest way.

447
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:18,830
Right?

448
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,660
I have confidence in you.

449
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,350
But I have no confidence in me.

450
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,860
You can do it. Go.

451
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:27,760
Let's go.

452
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,020
Let's go.

453

Come on! Come on!

482
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,690
Defense!

483
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:33,970
Come on! Come on! Come on!

484
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:58,040
Come on! Come on! Come on!

485
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,210
What did you do?

486
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:11,330
You hit him.

487
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:14,870
You're unscrupulous.

488
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:15,260
Sorry.

489
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,080
I was not on purpose.

490
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,010
What did you do?

491
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,210
I was not on purpose.

492
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:20,960
Get out of the way.

493
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,360
Do you want to play?

494
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:23,870
Yes.

495
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,140
The game continues.

496
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,240
Defence!

497
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:31,430
Come on! Come on! Come on!

498
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:34,760
Wait, referee.

499
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,340
The score was

500
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,390
37 to 45.

501
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,350
Why is our team 33 now?

502
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,350
Well.

503
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,730
Why is our team 33 now?

504
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,280
This is a good opportunity.

505
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,490
The fall is worth four points.

506
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,800
It's quite special to get three plus one points.

507
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,500
Referee.

508
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,800
The score should be

509
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,670
37 to 45.

510
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,400
Mr. Wang.

511
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:53,830
Just change it

512
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,970
into 37 to 45.

513
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,680
They can't win

514
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,260
even we give them four more points.

515
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:57,780
That's right.

516
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,830
It doesn't matter.

517
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,500
What do you mean by giving us four points?

518
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,160
We have indeed got 37 points.

519
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:02,850
Okay.

520
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,800
Just change it into 37 to 45.

521
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:05,900
The game continues.

522
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,180
Give you four points.

523
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,180
What do you mean?

524
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:10,870
Say it again.

525
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,210
What do you mean by giving us four points?

526
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,870
So what?

527
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,100
Did you fight too?

528
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,240
No.

529
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,180
What are you doing here?

530
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,150
When have you become

531
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,280
the principal of Experiment High School?

532
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:39,860
I transferred here last month.

533
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,440
What? Do I need to report to you

534
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,270
my job transfer?

535
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,300
No need.

536
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,710
I'm the witness.

537
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,100
Principal.

538
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,460
Tell me.

539
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,620
What happened just now?

540
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,940
The student from Class 1

541
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:53,750
fouled Zheng Tianming from our class

542
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,910
during the game,

543
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,780
causing Zheng Tianming

544
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,040
to fall down.

545
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:57,860
At the same time, Zheng knocked over the table

546
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:58,930
where the scoreboard was placed.

547
00:22:59,240 --> 00:22:59,960
The game was interrupted.

548
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,750
Players of both sides

549
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:01,780
had some minor conflicts.

550
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,830
Then, the scoreboard was put back.

551
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:04,940
But our score

552
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,860
was changed

553
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,860
from 37 to 33.

554
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,040
Zheng Tianming found this mistake

555
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,070
and pointed it out.

556
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,420
But none of Class 1's students admitted it.

557
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,630
Zhang Liang said

558
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,600
it could be changed into 37 points.

559
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,710
But your attitude was bad

560
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,940
as if our class was cheating.

561
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,100
But our class really got 37 points.

562
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,330
Our class

563
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,310
raised doubts.

564
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,500
Then, they pushed someone of our class

565
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,700
and we had some conflicts with them.

566
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:26,700
That's all?

567
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,420
That's all.

568
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,240
Zhang Liang, what happened?

569
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,860
Principal, here's how it happened.

570
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,430
Chen Chu accidentally

571
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,460
knocked Zheng Tianming down.

572
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,070
Class 13 wanted to take the chance to get more points

573
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,100
and caused conflicts with us.

574
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,210
You...

575
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:40,870
Sir.

576
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,070
Can I say something?

577
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:44,610
Go ahead.

578
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:46,810
The score of our class was indeed

579
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,320
37 points.

580
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,110
I remember the scoring record

581
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:49,540
from the beginning of the basketball game

582
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,500
to the break.

583
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,110
You're bragging.

584
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:54,540
Here's the scoring order

585
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,140
of Class 13.

586
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,220
A lay-up. A perimeter shot. A free throw.

587
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,140
A rebound.

588
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,300
Two perimeter shots. A three-point shot.

589
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,000
Two lay-ups. A three-point shot.

590
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,180
A rebound. A tip-in.

591
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,050
Two three-point shots.

592
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,590
A three-point shot. A perimeter shot.

593
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,010
A three-point shot. A lay-up.

594
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,430
It's 37 points in total.

595
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,340
Sir, if you need,

596
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,610
I can give you

597
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,330
the names and numbers of the students

598
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,240
who scored each time.

599
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,460
I can also tell you

600
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:17,080
everything that was going on at that time.

601
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,200
Okay. Okay. Okay.

602
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:24,060
Class 1.

603
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:25,210
What else do you want to say?

604
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:26,470
Sir, I...

605
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,350
I may not remember

606
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,140
as clearly as him.

607
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:30,340
Maybe the score

608
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,140
was wrong.

609
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,710
But we didn't make it on purpose.

610
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,860
They couldn't hit us.

611
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,970
You pushed me first.

612
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,540
I pushed you means I hit you?

613
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,730
The guy from your class

614
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:39,980
gave me a kick.

615
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,820
Are you done?

616
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,260
Do you want to continue to fight?

617
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:47,590
You're in 12th grade.

618
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,350
You shouldn't hold

619
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,060
any basketball game.

620
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:50,430
Some teachers said

621
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,460
it could relax you

622
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,890
and lighten your pressure.

623
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,060
I said it was not necessary.

624
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:54,620
Look.

625
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:05,540
Well.

626
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:08,180
Class 13 stays here.

627
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,610
Class 1, go back to the classroom.

628
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,420
Thank you, principal.

629
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,200
You were all good.

630
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,410
You even cared about the score of basketball.

631
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,570
But your grades are getting lower.

632
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:30,730
Why don't you care about it?

633
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,120
All of you

634
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,540
like to fight with others actively.

635
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,180
Everyone wants to be a hero.

636
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,730
A hero.

637
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:36,890
Just wait.

638
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,020
I'll record you serious demerits.

639
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,250
I have a problem, principal.

640
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,540
What do you think?

641
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,870
It's none of your business. Go to play.

642
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:42,870
Before I play,

643
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,860
I need to tell you the thing clearly.

644
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,310
It was Class 1's fault.

645
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:45,830
Why?

646
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,220
Why does only Class 13 get punished?

647
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,140
Do you have any evidence?

648
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,460
Everyone saw it.

649
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,700
It's useless.

650
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,900
You said class 1 started it.

651
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,130
But they said it was your fault.

652
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,500
Who should I believe?

653
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,580
Anyway, I think

654
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,600
you should ask more people.

655
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:58,660
You should find out the truth at least.

656
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,380
I don't have the time

657
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:01,250
to do research.

658
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,400
Your arguments were different.

659
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,620
I chose to believe

660
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,200
the one who performed better.

661
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,020
Was I wrong?

662
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:08,190
Perform better.

663
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,170
Does better performance mean

664
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,640
good grades?

665
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:10,200
Yes.

666
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,890
I don't think good grades

667
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,720
can represent everything.

668
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,190
It doesn't mean

669
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:14,980
good morality.

670
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,180
And everyone in Class 1

671
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,390
were all arrogant.

672
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,220
I think if you were me,

673
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,840
you should also be unable to stand it.

674
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:20,940
Lin Zhaoxi.

675
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:22,340
Shut up your mouth.

676
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,070
Since you were a kid,

677
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,560
you've been so impressive.

678
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,620
You can be the principal.

679
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:26,830
You're the principal,

680
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,100
but you can't abuse your authority.

681
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:29,820
What a serious accusation!

682
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:31,350
Let me tell you.

683
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,640
I didn't want to only focus on the study.

684
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,350
But I had to make a decision.

685
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,780
Just now,

686
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,140
both of you expressed your opinions

687
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,820
and wanted to stay here.

688
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,250
How long would it take?

689
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,460
Stay here until the final exam?

690
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,060
There are less than 300 days

691
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,880
to the college entrance exam.

692
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:48,740
Less than 300 days.

693
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:49,510
Everyone.

694
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,370
Please wake up.

695
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:53,610
Well.

696
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:54,720
I'll deal with it later.

697
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,020
Go back now.

698
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,480
Go.

699
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:12,870
Have you thought about

700
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:13,870
your future?

701
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,370
What if you have no college to go after the college entrance exam?

702
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:17,790
You'll be done for.

703
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:18,820
You'll be shocked.

704
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,250
Good job.

705
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,680
Class 13 never gives up!

706
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,470
Class 13 never gives up!

707
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,340
Good job.

708
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:37,280
Never give up.

709
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,000
Classmates.

710
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,470
Thank you.

711
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,380
My dad said

712
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,740
we should have integrity.

713
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:52,550
Right?

714
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:53,860
Yes.

715
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:55,980
The reason that I can fight dauntlessly ahead

716
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:57,560
is your support

717
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,500
behind our backs.

718
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,160
Good job, Class 13!

719
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,600
Bravo! Bravo!

720
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,210
You really think you're a hero?

721
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,110
Go back and sit down.

722
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:27,680
All of you

723
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,170
are getting bolder.

724
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,830
You just kept calm for a few days.

725
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,890
You're making trouble again.

726
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,450
How dare you fight with others?

727
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,520
Mr. Xie.

728
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,400
Class 1 started the conflicts.

729
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,560
That's why the following things happened.

730
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,640
Did I ask you to speak?

731
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:39,890
Sit down.

732
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,120
I have only one question.

733
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,340
You must answer me honestly.

734
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:47,210
Which class

735
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,630
started today's conflicts?

736
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,190
Class 1.

737
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:54,250
Okay, I trust you.

738
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,260
I'll go to the principal now.

739
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:59,140
Good. Good. Good.

740
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,590
Study quietly.

741
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,000
Mr. Xie, I love you.

742
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,180
Hurry up.

743
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:27,750
Okay.

744
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:32,560
Teacher Zhang.

745
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,350
I feel that you have handled

746
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,800
today's matter quite unfairly.

747
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,020
If I remember correctly,

748
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,170
since I came to Experiment High School,

749
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,320
you've been calling me Principal Zhang.

750
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,120
Why do you

751
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,260
call me Teacher Zhang again today?

752
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,570
What do you think?

753
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,320
Fighting is definitely wrong.

754
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,700
But both parties are responsible.

755
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,240
And it was Class 1

756
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,020
started it.

757
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,420
Why only my class's students

758
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:56,340
were punished?

759
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,620
Class 1 said

760
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,820
your class started it.

761
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,100
Teacher Zhang.

762
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:01,800
I believe my students.

763
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,420
The class teacher of Class 1, Ms. Ma,

764
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,800
also believes her students.

765
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,560
Teacher Zhang.

766
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,590
You can't draw such a conclusion

767
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,150
just because the two classes

768
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,580
have different grades.

769
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:13,820
Mr. Xie.

770
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:15,890
Of course I know

771
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,310
grades can't represent

772
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,220
one's character.

773
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,130
The reason why

774
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,590
I only criticized your students

775
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:23,360
was that I wanted to use

776
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:24,590
this opportunity

777
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,580
to stimulate them.

778
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,540
I wanted to let them be brave after they felt ashamed

779
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,210
and make them focus on their study.

780
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,130
I wanted to turn this fight

781
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,060
into a good thing

782
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,230
that could let them make progress.

783
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,260
Here's my opinion.

784
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:37,050
Teacher Zhang, you've done a lot.

785
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,860
I understand.

786
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,450
But I disagree with you.

787
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,670
You might

788
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,500
ruin their values of right and wrong.

789
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,180
Why are you laughing?

790
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,320
Nothing.

791
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,550
I just think

792
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,210
during these years,

793
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,400
you look

794
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,630
like a dough.

795
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,770
Everyone can pinch it.

796
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,520
But you're actually a piece of iron.

797
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:58,660
Good.

798
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:03,050
Thank you for your compliment.

799
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,460
I'm not praising you.

800
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,520
How was Lin Zhaoxi?

801
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,780
How did she react?

802
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:11,940
She was still

803
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:14,030
the same as when she was a child.

804
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,020
She was so angry.

805
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:15,880
But this

806
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,800
had nothing to do with her.

807
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:18,530
I believe it.

808
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,620
Okay, it's effective.

809
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:23,950
How about this?

810
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,060
When you go back,

811
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,010
tell your students

812
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,980
everyone in the fight

813
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,400
will be punished.

814
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,060
I won't record it in the archives.

815
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,300
At the end of the semester, students with good performance

816
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:37,920
can automatically cancel their demerits.

817
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,900
The students include those from Class 1.

818
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:44,260
Thank you, Teacher Zhang.

819
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,460
You should

820
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,100
keep an eye on Lin Zhaoxi.

821
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,500
Supervise her.

822
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:57,860
She's quite good. Let her work harder.

823
00:31:59,020 --> 00:31:59,620
I see.

824
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,120
You're all top students.

825
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:12,670
How could you fight

826
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,660
with those bad students from Class 13?

827
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,560
Sir, they started the fight.

828
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,670
That's right.

829
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,290
But you couldn't fight back.

830
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,960
You should come to the teacher.

831
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,410
The school has decided

832
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,220
that everyone in the fight,

833
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,080
no matter from Class 1 or Class 13,

834
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,000
should be punished.

835
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,480
Why?

836
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,470
Only those who perform well

837
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,050
can cancel their demerits at the end of the semester.

838
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,110
Okay, be quiet.

839
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,090
Class begins now.

840
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:49,950
How are you going home?

841
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,910
I'll take the bus.

842
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,250
My dad is on night duty today.

843
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,150
I'll take you home.

844
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:58,790
No need.

845
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,470
We both have different routes home.

846
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,360
Forget it if you don't want to.

847
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,850
I didn't say I didn't want to.

848
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,380
Well.

849
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,210
If you insist on taking me home,

850
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,270
I accept it.

851
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:17,330
You don't have to say that.

852
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:23,210
How do you feel today?

853
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,750
Quite lively, right?

854
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,610
I used to think

855
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,490
life in senior high school was hard.

856
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,420
But from today's experience,

857
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:33,850
it's not bad actually.

858
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:35,930
Yes.

859
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,820
Especially when you dance...

860
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,060
No, don't mention it.

861
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,780
Don't mention it.

862
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,460
I want to find a crack to go in.

863
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:43,610
No.

864
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,910
I think your dancing was cute.

865
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,510
Many movements were wrong.

866
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:48,060
Really?

867
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,240
I can't see.

868
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:50,630
Really?

869
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:51,650
No.

870
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:54,710
Your movements

871
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,310
were totally different

872
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,020
from the other two.

873
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,770
Don't tell the truth.

874
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,690
But when you stood in the middle

875
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,010
and danced differently from them,

876
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:03,740
it looked like it was your design in advance.

877
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:04,650
It was very natural.

878
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:07,300
That's more like it.

879
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:11,400
How unlucky.

880
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,260
Class 13 was bad at playing basketball.

881
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,460
They wouldn't win even if we gave them 10 more points.

882
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,070
This little thing

883
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,130
made our game canceled.

884
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,449
We also got punished.

885
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:20,860
What should we do?

886
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:22,179
This is my first time being punished.

887
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:22,889
What are you afraid of?

888
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,199
The demerits will be canceled certainly.

889
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,310
Liang is also

890
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:26,940
with us.

891
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:28,270
If my dad knows,

892
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,370
he'll beat me to death.

893
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:31,460
I have to apply to study abroad.

894
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:33,340
Will it affect me?

895
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:33,940
It will be fine.

896
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,270
The demerits will be canceled certainly.

897
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,920
If it doesn't work,

898
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:38,909
at the end of the semester,

899
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,060
I'll ask my dad to come to school

900
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:41,290
to talk to the principal.

901
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,409
My dad knows

902
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,040
the director of the education authority.

903
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,570
Liang, I'm counting on you.

904
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,159
It's okay.

905
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:52,100
When will the audition

906
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,800
that Hua Juan signed up start?

907
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,560
Maybe on the weekend.

908
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,260
Look.

909
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:56,780
Lin Zhaoxi and Pei Zhi.

910
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,020
Can we watch it on TV?

911
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:00,880
Zhang Liang and his friends.

912
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:20,700
Pei Zhi.

913
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:23,140
I'm so disappointed in you.

914
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,740
I thought

915
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,950
although you went to Class 13

916
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,330
for this girl,

917
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,190
your heart was on Class 1's side.

918
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,110
But today,

919
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,300
you helped outsiders.

920
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,140
Actually, I always think

921
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,240
Zhang Liang is quite interesting.

922
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:36,550
I've never seen a man

923
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,210
who could keep his naive teenage period

924
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,250
for such a long time.

925
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,070
Was he always like this

926
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:39,980
in the Strawberry World?

927
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:40,470
Yes.

928
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,660
Did you hear me?

929
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,270
Zhang Liang, this afternoon,

930
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,360
I just told the truth.

931
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:48,900
I didn't mean to side with anyone.

932
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,340
You're quibbling. You should be punished.

933
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:50,920
Traitor!

934
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,150
No, no, everyone.

935
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,260
You just got punished today.

936
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,880
Do you want to be expelled from school?

937
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,030
Liang, I think what she said

938
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,740
makes sense.

939
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,250
We should be more cautious.

940
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:01,860
Don't be afraid.

941
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,020
This is not the school.

942
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,340
Teachers can't control us now.

943
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:08,540
Pei Zhi.

944
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:09,740
How about this?

945
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,830
I'll give you another chance.

946
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,280
Go back to Class 1.

947
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,290
There's nothing good in Class 13.

948
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,110
If you really go there

949
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:17,870
for this girl,

950
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,460
I can tutor her

951
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:20,290
with you,

952
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,460
so that she can come to Class 1.

953
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,020
No, no, no.

954
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,060
You don't need to tutor me.

955
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,700
-You might as well beat me.
-You have no right to speak.

956
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,350
One against six.

957
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,570
Can you defeat them?

958
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:31,550
Yes.

959
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,140
But I don't want to hurt them.

960
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,490
After all, they are just children.

961
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:35,820
What should we do?

962
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:37,780
Let's leave.

963
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,280
Are you two in tune with each other

964
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,230
like doing crosstalk?

965
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,710
He don't let us go.

966
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,600
Let's run.

967
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:48,920
Liang.

968
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:50,510
Wait.

969
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,500
Can you still run?

970
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,250
Yes.

971
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:18,830
What are they playing?

972
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:21,620
Chase them!

973
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:24,000
Chase them!

974
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,330
Okay.

975
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:27,090
Wait for me.

976
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,780
Young people nowadays

977
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,350
can run so fast.

978
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:41,950
If we can't escape,

979
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,860
we have to beat them up.

980
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:44,450
Don't fight. Don't fight.

981
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:46,220
We're friends. We're friends.

982
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,460
Who is your friend?

983
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:48,740
Zhang Liang.

984
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:51,250
I've known you for so many years.

985
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:52,270
Aren't you angry with Pei Zhi

986
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,660
that he don't play with you?

987
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:54,270
Pei Zhi.

988
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,710
You can talk to him.

989
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,580
He's not a bad guy.

990
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,180
I'll beat you up.

991
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,550
You just pay lip service to that.

992
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,670
When did you ever hit me?

993
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:01,880
Let me tell you.

994
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:02,700
Have you been punished

995
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:03,490
already?

996
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:04,410
If anything happens again,

997
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:05,740
I'll tell the school tomorrow.

998
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,820
Nobody will have a good result.

999
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,740
Are you a member of Class 1?

1000
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,680
How can you betray us?

1001
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:12,440
Lu Zhihao.

1002
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,780
It's none of your business.

1003
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:14,760
I can handle it.

1004
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:15,150
Don't do that.

1005
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,290
Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

1006
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,090
Listen to me.

1007
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:21,340
Some of you wants to be recommended to colleges

1008
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,980
or go abroad, right?

1009
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,140
If you're punished seriously,

1010
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,060
it's all over.

1011
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:25,970
Yes, Liang.

1012
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,550
I think Hao is right.

1013
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,340
We are classmates.

1014
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:28,970
We don't have much hatred of each other.

1015
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:29,460
Right?

1016
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:30,100
Yes.

1017
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,340
Liang, when we were young, we were in a team

1018
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,480
and won the gold medal of Olympic mathematics competition.

1019
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,540
I forgot about it.

1020
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,300
Xi.

1021
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:39,730
I haven't played billiards for days.

1022
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:40,700
I miss you.

1023
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,240
Tell me if you're in trouble.

1024
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,180
I'll protect you.

1025
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,280
Look at

1026
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,300
the friends she makes.

1027
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,560
What are you talking about?

1028
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:51,360
I'm sorry.

1029
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,300
Sorry, brother.

1030
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,140
We are classmates.

1031
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,410
Who is your brother?

1032
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,540
This friend,

1033
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,190
I don't know you.

1034
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:58,560
If you don't leave,

1035
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,120
I'll call the police.

1036
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:01,290
Call the police?

1037
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,420
Try it.

1038
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,660
Xi, tell me, Brother Da Tou.

1039
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,470
Are they your classmates?

1040
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,140
Who told you to tell the teacher?

1041
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,230
Xi.

1042
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,790
How intimate they are.

1043
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,050
Do you want to be hit?

1044
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:16,470
Stop fighting!

1045
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:17,880
Stop fighting! Stop fighting!

1046
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,010
He's my friend in the welfare home.

1047
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,200
Stop fighting!

1048
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:25,800
Stop!

1049
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,840
Let's go.

1050
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:29,280
Something happened.

1051
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:31,120
Lu.

1052
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,380
How long will you

1053
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,300
sit here?

1054
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,140
Until you

1055
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,100
promise me.

1056
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,140
I said I would think about it.

1057
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,020
Don't be ignorant.

1058
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:11,540
I'm not doing this for you.

1059
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,110
These two kids

1060
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,150
are going to college soon.

1061
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,070
The annual tuition and living expenses

1062
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:20,060
will be about 40,000 to 50,000 yuan.

1063
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,340
Why don't you open a cram school?

1064
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,910
Is you salary enough now?

1065
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:27,180
I told you.

1066
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,040
My research is just one step away from being finished.

1067
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,340
Zhaosheng, let's be realistic.

1068
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,800
On the way of fundamental mathematics,

1069
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:36,620
many people

1070
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,600
have almost reached the end

1071
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,320
in just a distance of hair.

1072
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,030
But he probably

1073
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:42,820
can never shorten

1074
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,020
such little distance.

1075
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,180
Even the finishing line

1076
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,540
is wrong. It doesn't exist.

1077
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,220
What you are studying

1078
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,940
is a part of P=NP problem.

1079
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:53,760
Even if you succeed,

1080
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,150
you can only gain

1081
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,380
recognition from the academic world.

1082
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,900
It's still far from gaining fame and fortune.

1083
00:40:59,050 --> 00:40:59,610
You can't get these.

1084
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,660
I don't think so.

1085
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,910
I have stuck to one thing for 20 years.

1086
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,340
You want me to give up now?

1087
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,400
I don't want to.

1088
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:09,820
I don't ask you

1089
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:11,090
to give up on your research.

1090
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,640
You should focus on your teaching.

1091
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,660
You can do whatever you want

1092
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:14,530
in your spare time.

1093
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,000
If I teach students every day,

1094
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,310
I won't have any spare time.

1095
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:22,920
I'll support their tuition.

1096
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,500
Will you accept it?

1097
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:24,600
Xi.

1098
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:30,930
Hello?

1099
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:38,880
The patient has an ulnar radius fracture

1100
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:39,690
and multiple contusions.

1101
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,780
He needs a timely incisional composite

1102
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,530
and an nternal plate fixation surgery.

1103
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:45,420
My son

1104
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,620
wants to be a surgeon.

1105
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,190
Will it affect him?

1106
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:49,860
It's hard to say.

1107
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,010
It depends on the recovery.

1108
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:52,660
I'll get ready.

1109
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,090
Thank you, doctor.

1110
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,010
Actually, no one saw

1111
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,660
how Lu fell down.

1112
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,060
You can't

1113
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:02,470
only blame our family for this.

1114
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:03,590
Mom.

1115
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:05,550
Actually, it was my fault.

1116
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:06,910
If we hadn't

1117
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:07,890
gone to Pei Zhi,

1118
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,740
the latter things wouldn't have happened.

1119
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,290
Look at you.

1120
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,520
Are you out of your mind because of hard study?

1121
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:13,260
Zhang Liang.

1122
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,390
Where are the other students

1123
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:16,650
who participated in the fight?

1124
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:19,120
Principal Zhang, they all went back.

1125
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,640
This has nothing to do with them.

1126
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,220
If there's anything wrong,

1127
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:23,910
I'll take the responsibility.

1128
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:24,830
Principal Zhang.

1129
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,580
Why are you here?

1130
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:27,820
Actually,

1131
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:29,180
they were just playing.

1132
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,190
They were definitely not fighting.

1133
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,220
Absolutely not.

1134
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,060
I think it was just an accident.

1135
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:34,300
An accident?

1136
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:35,410
An accident?

1137
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:36,780
Zhang Liang’s mom.

1138
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:37,630
If your son

1139
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:38,620
is lying on the bed,

1140
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:39,510
can you

1141
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,580
be so casual?

1142
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,300
-Mom.
-How could you say that?

1143
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,750
It was an accident.

1144
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,420
It's okay, Zhang Liang.

1145
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:45,390
We're still friends.

1146
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,700
Your arm has been hurt.

1147
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,710
How could it be an accident?

1148
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:48,650
Everyone saw it.

1149
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,920
They saw it.

1150
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:50,740
Well, Zhang Liang’s mom.

1151
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:51,630
Actually, our family

1152
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,560
-is willing to pay medical fees.
-I don't want to hear your explanation.

1153
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,680
-I don't want to hear your explanation.
-Mom.

1154
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,860
His arm has been hurt.

1155
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:57,420
Is this about medical expenses now?

1156
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,120
Do you think you can just give me some money?

1157
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,180
Did you do it?

1158
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,210
Everyone saw it.

1159
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:02,660
-Auntie.
-Don't worry.

1160
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:02,990
Mom.
