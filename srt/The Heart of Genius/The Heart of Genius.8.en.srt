[Episode 8]

4
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,240
Twist it.

5
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,930
What's that look?

6
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,360
Doesn't that look like you?

7
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,979
Not like me. I'm so cool.

8
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,090
Try your sunglasses cookies.

9
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,150
By the way,

10
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,960
Mimi, it's time to eat.

11
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,980
What are you doing?

12
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,280
A stray cat I adopted.

13
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,190
You really decided to adopt it?

14
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,410
It won't leave.

15
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,850
What can I do?

16
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,140
Indeed.

17
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,220
Having a stray cat

18
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,400
is much easier

19
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,230
than raising a stray child.

20
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,780
Master,

21
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,460
let me ask you a question.

22
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,170
Do you prefer being alone

23
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,270
or having a child?

24
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,900
I prefer being alone.

25
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,390
It's obvious.

26
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:32,980
A man

27
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,660
raising a child,

28
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:35,760
and being a single father.

29
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:36,960
It's tiring even to think about it.

30
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,290
Although it's comfortable to be alone,

31
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,010
but having a child

32
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,130
might make it feel better to live.

33
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,420
What do you mean?

34
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,220
The feeling of caring for someone.

35
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,020
You never care about anyone before?

36
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:56,780
No.

37
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,130
But now I have.

38
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:06,970
I'm talking about the cat.

39
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:17,910
Come in.

40
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:20,910
Come in

41
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:44,170
Come in. The teams headed by Lin Zhaoxi and Pei Zhi sneak out after lights are out every day.

42
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,230
Someone is here.

43
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,370
Let's go.

44
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,550
Let's go.

45
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,300
Let's go.

46
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,420
Get down! Get down!

47
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,680
Get down!

48
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,990
Go in.

49
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,060
Let's go.

50
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,900
Let's go.

51
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:24,900
Go.

52
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,810
Qu Ge, keep up.

53
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,300
Have you remembered?

54
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,620
That's all for today.

55
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,620
Lastly,

56
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,970
I'll give you a quiz for fun.

57
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,100
Use your brain.

58
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,730
There is a fat bear

59
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,580
at Point P.

60
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,140
And then,

61
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,560
it goes south for a mile,

62
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,910
and east for a mile.

63
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,020
Then turns left and goes north

64
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:05,960
for a mile.

65
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,830
Then goes back to Point P.

66
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:10,560
The question is what color the bear is.

67
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,610
What?

68
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,570
What's the question?

69
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,440
Why ask about the color?

70
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,040
This is a brain teaser.

71
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,660
Is it fun?

72
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,040
No one knows.

73
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,330
Who is the leader?

74
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,010
Me.

75
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,360
I'm afraid I'll fail the exam,

76
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,310
so I hired a teacher.

77
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:06,850
Mr. Lin is a good teacher.

78
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,550
We like to listen to Mr. Lin.

79
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,360
Enough.

80
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,580
Do you know

81
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,540
what rules you broke?

82
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,130
Why are you still here so late?

83
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:18,960
Who will take responsibility if something happens?

84
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:20,730
The leader will be responsible.

85
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,650
Why are you all silent?

86
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,300
You didn't break the law.

87
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,430
You're afraid he'll scold you and beat you.

88
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,100
Be quiet.

89
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:35,940
I'll punish you later.

90
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,240
Punish me?

91
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,170
You said it.

92
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,360
We are not in the same system.

93
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,140
Besides,

94
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,680
first, I'm not your lackey.

95
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,890
Second, I didn't break the law.

96
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,250
Who are you to punish me?

97
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,720
Listen to yourself.

98
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,860
Is this what you want to teach them?

99
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,610
No one here

100
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,470
will beat you and scold you.

101
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,510
But the rules

102
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,810
was set from the beginning.

103
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:00,840
Whoever breaks the rules

104
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,160
will be punished.

105
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,720
Those who want to learn fun math, stay.

106
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,880
Those who want to join the Jin's Competition, go back to sleep.

107
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,260
Let's go.

108
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,460
Let's go.

109
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:19,900
Go back to sleep. Go.

110
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,870
When I saw you in the canteen,

111
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,419
I knew

112
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,000
nothing good will happen.

113
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,730
Will our master be alright?

114
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,040
Don't worry.

115
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,300
He is a temporary worker.

116
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,890
This is my fault.

117
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:17,860
I'll take the responsibility.

118
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:19,520
Will it affect the matter

119
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,820
of you and Hua Juan?

120
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,600
Don't worry about it.

121
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,530
One step at a time.

122
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:26,980
Stop talking.

123
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,800
Don't you know how much trouble you've caused?

124
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,150
Are you afraid you can't go back?

125
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:44,770
I'm ready

126
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,920
to live

127
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,600
in this world.

128
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,040
Thank goodness you're here.

129
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,110
It won't be boring.

130
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,530
Do you have parents?

131
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,370
Don't force it when it comes to fate.

132
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,010
Some things can't be asked for.

133
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,580
I'm an orphan

134
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,640
that no one wants.

135
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:05,240
I'm used to it.

136
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,540
The most painful thing

137
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,320
is to see

138
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,500
my classmate's birthday.

139
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,380
I always try to stay away.

140
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,080
Come in.

141
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,620
-Mr. Zhang, sorry to disturb you. -Mr. Xie.

142
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,390
Have a seat.

143
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,160
I want to speak for Lin Zhaoxi.

144
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:46,820
Why?

145
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,390
They broke the rules

146
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,250
to study.

147
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,890
And you know,

148
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,990
in the training camp,

149
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,070
their groups

150
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,020
are the most hardworking.

151
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,190
Mr. Lin,

152
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,450
I met him once

153
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,120
in the park before.

154
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,290
I didn't know

155
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,790
he was tutoring them secretly.

156
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,450
I don't think he has any bad intentions.

157
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,760
His name is Lin Zhaosheng.

158
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,380
Just like you.

159
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,990
He was also a postgraduate of math major

160
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,340
in Sanwei University.

161
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,350
When he was in school,

162
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,620
he was arrogant.

163
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,590
His life style is chaotic.

164
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:22,410
He got a student

165
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,640
from another university pregnant.

166
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,690
He plagiarized a professor's thesis

167
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,270
and eventually got expelled.

168
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,040
We can't be fearless.

169
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,090
I emphasize the rules.

170
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,370
I don't want the students

171
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,520
to become like him in the future.

172
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,640
Hua Juan, Hua Juan.

173
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:49,740
Where is Pei Zhi?

174
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:50,730
I don't know.

175
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:51,670
His was not in bed

176
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,910
when I woke up.

177
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,980
I didn't see him in the canteen either.

178
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,330
You guys,

179
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,990
what will Snape do to us?

180
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,490
Master said

181
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,780
there's nothing to be afraid of.

182
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,080
It's not embarrassing to study.

183
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,080
Well said.

184
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,620
Mr. Zhang is here.

185
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,370
I have an announcement before class.

186
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,330
Yesterday the members in

187
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,290
the two teams headed by Lin Zhaoxi and Pei Zhi

188
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,440
made serious violations of our disciplines.

189
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,500
After discussion by all the faculty and staff,

190
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,060
the following penalties will be imposed:

191
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,050
First,

192
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,400
the members of these two teams are disqualified from

193
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,970
obtaining certificates of completion.

194
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,180
Second,

195
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,820
Lin Zhaoxi is expelled, effective immediately.

196
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,380
Lin Zhaoxi.

197
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:44,450
Mr. Xie is contacting

198
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,070
your parents.

199
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,630
You can go back to your dorm

200
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,420
and pack up.

201
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,120
Dang Aimin, what do you want?

202
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,080
If she leaves, I'll leave too.

203
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,760
Are you threatening me?

204
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,500
If she leaves,

205
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,560
I don't have any reason to stay.

206
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:06,970
Okay.

207
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,080
Who else wants to leave?

208
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,830
Stand up now.

209
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,640
No one will stop you.

210
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,970
But I will report to the Education Bureau.

211
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,980
I'll inform the school and parents

212
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,100
of your violations

213
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,420
and record them in your files.

214
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:24,940
Lu Zhihao.

215
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,710
My homeroom teacher is my mother.

216
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,230
I was beaten up when I was young.

217
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,180
What am I afraid of?

218
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:32,970
Okay.

219
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,190
Who else?

220
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,220
Very good.

221
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:47,790
You can leave now.

222
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,200
I'll inform the parents now.

223
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,380
Mr. Zhang, a call for you.

224
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:02,780
Hello?

225
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,810
Zhang, this is Zeng Qingran.

226
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,110
Mr. Zeng.

227
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,200
You contacted Professor Zeng?

228
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,650
You solved Kongming Chess?

229
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:19,850
I told you

230
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,170
I'll help you go home.

231
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,380
Professor Zeng.

232
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,810
I've solved Kongming Chess.

233
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,630
Well done.

234
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,050
I know Pei Zhi is a genius.

235
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,370
That's exactly why

236
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,020
I have to restrain him.

237
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,540
I know.

238
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:04,870
But my words,

239
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,300
I hope you can consider them.

240
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:09,170
I understand.

241
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,340
You called me.

242
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,860
I must reconsider.

243
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,900
But Mr. Zeng, do you know

244
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:15,950
who has been

245
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:16,860
teaching them math?

246
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,130
Do you remember Lin Zhaosheng?

247
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,590
Lin Zhaosheng?

248
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,630
I thought you were so united

249
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,540
and loyal.

250
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,980
Let's go together.

251
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:27,890
Why are there still people sitting here?

252
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,310
Sorry, Lin Zhaoxi.

253
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,010
I don't want to leave here like this.

254
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:32,500
Thank you.

255
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,650
You really don't have to apologize.

256
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,220
I told you

257
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,060
I should

258
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,350
responsible for this.

259
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,190
Do you really think

260
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,330
you are the leader?

261
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,540
Stop pretending.

262
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,320
Zhang Liang.

263
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,990
Shut your mouth.

264
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,050
Pei Zhi, come to our team.

265
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,420
This is the right choice.

266
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,610
You and I

267
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,310
will make the best team.

268
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,310
Let's sweep the Olympic Mathematics

269
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,210
of primary school level together.

270
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,310
What do you want?

271
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,380
Do you want to pick a fight?

272
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,590
I'm not afraid of you.

273
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,030
But I'm warning you.

274
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,460
You're a good student.

275
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,620
You can solve Kongming Chess.

276
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,130
If you get expelled

277
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:12,880
because of fighting,

278
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,490
won't you think it's a pity?

279
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,620
Think about it, Pei Zhi.

280
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,560
Pei Zhi, calm down.

281
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,870
Calm down.

282
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,680
Mr. Zhang is here.

283
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,380
Go back.

284
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:40,690
Calm down.

285
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,110
Zhang Liang, anyone wants to fight?

286
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,460
Anyone wants to fight?

287
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,470
Sit down.

288
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,380
Pei Zhi,

289
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,140
you are a very excellent student.

290
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,900
The second best student

291
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,780
I've seen in my life.

292
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:29,980
Genius

293
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,350
will be treated better.

294
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,660
The teachers in school will favor you.

295
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,650
If others violates the discipline,

296
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,020
their parents will be asked to school.

297
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,810
If a genius violates the discipline,

298
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,960
it'll be over easily.

299
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,100
When others sleep in class,

300
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,260
they will be scolded by the teacher.

301
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,060
If a genius sleeps in class,

302
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,180
the teacher may say to other students:

303
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,580
you can sleep too

304
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,900
as long as you get full marks.

305
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,340
When you go to the university,

306
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:04,980
teachers there

307
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,290
revolve around the genius.

308
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,070
During postgraduate studies,

309
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,300
the professors were eager to be the advisor of the genius.

310
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,580
Everything goes smoothly.

311
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,160
That's why they will lose everything

312
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:23,730
and act recklessly.

313
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,820
Mr. Zhang, I won't do that.

314
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:29,880
I'm not talking about you.

315
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,460
I mean

316
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,240
the first genius I met

317
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,690
who taught you math secretly.

318
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,360
Lin Zhaosheng.

319
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,260
You treat him as your teacher

320
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,670
and treat me as your enemy.

321
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,690
I totally understand.

322
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,240
Because he plays with you.

323
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:47,470
He won't teach you

324
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,640
how to follow the rules.

325
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,820
He will tell you

326
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,260
to destroy it.

327
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:55,800
Don't listen to them.

328
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,380
Do whatever you want.

329
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,100
Don't say that about Lin.

330
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,550
But I'm not wrong.

331
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,980
You can ask him

332
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,900
why he can only be a guard.

333
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:13,860
Let's see what he says.

334
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,090
Lin treat life as merely playing games.

335
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,330
How can life be a game, kid?

336
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,700
You asked Professor Zeng to speak for you.

337
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:25,810
It's a great honor, Pei Zhi.

338
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,340
I announce

339
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,470
all the punishments

340
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,420
of these two teams are cancelled.

341
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,080
I won't inform the school and parents either.

342
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,580
But Lin Zhaoxi,

343
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,100
you must leave today.

344
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,600
No one can save you.

345
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,830
As your teacher,

346
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,380
I must teach you this lesson.

347
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,190
Let me help you.

348
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:12,890
No need.

349
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,300
I can do it myself.

350
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,030
Everyone is waiting

351
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:18,930
to see you off.

352
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,020
I'll be ready soon.

353
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,130
I want to go home now.

354
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,160
I just want to go home.

355
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,630
My dad is still unconscious

356
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,350
in a hospital bed.

357
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,250
I have to go back.

358
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,970
Above here is

359
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,690
what you are learning.

360
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,540
Below is

361
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,030
what I'm working on.

362
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:23,490
The time

363
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,230
you can understand the difficult questions below

364
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,190
is the time you'll surpass me.

365
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,000
Okay, I'll study hard.

366
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,040
When I grow up, I'll help you solve the problem.

367
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,590
Pinky swear.

368
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,180
It's a deal

369
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,690
that will never change.

370
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:16,700
Where is Pei Zhi and Dang Aimin?

371
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,310
They went to the toilet upstairs.

372
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,450
Ask them to come down.

373
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,970
Let them watch Lin Zhaoxi leave.

374
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:45,830
Wait.

375
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,260
Pei Zhi, Dang Aimin.

376
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,160
Why are you carrying your luggages?

377
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,190
I said I'll go with her.

378
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,220
I'll leave if they leave.

379
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,120
Let's go. Get in.

380
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:11,700
Wait.

381
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,340
Before I leave,

382
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,750
I have something to say.

383
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,300
I want to thank my friends.

384
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,580
I came to the camp

385
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:37,730
to complete something

386
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,610
very important.

387
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,240
Although in the end,

388
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,920
I failed to do it.

389
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:47,390
But here,

390
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,500
I made many friends.

391
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,040
I can see in you

392
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:51,670
the passion

393
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,100
I had for math.

394
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,030
I really enjoyed

395
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,220
the days

396
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,140
I had with you.

397
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,030
I actually was

398
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,740
a very unconfident person.

399
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,070
But you really brought me

400
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,070
a lot of courage.

401
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,740
Mr. Zhang,

402
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,310
I understand you.

403
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:19,480
I know what you're thinking.

404
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,480
Because we are the same kind of people.

405
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,940
We are all losers.

406
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,260
We think that math is all about talent.

407
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:31,860
But we're

408
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:32,940
not geniuses.

409
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,660
So when we face

410
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,630
people of the same age

411
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,700
like Lin and Pei Zhi,

412
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,070
we want to be them,

413
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,280
envy them,

414
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,580
and even believe that only they can

415
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,230
make achievements in math.

416
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,910
But we forgot

417
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,900
our own will.

418
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,660
Actually, I've always wanted to

419
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:51,770
talk to you.

420
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,270
But

421
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,190
I really hate you now.

422
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,150
Just like hating

423
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,300
who I used to be.

424
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,390
Everyone's starting line

425
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:04,860
may be different,

426
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,810
but if you try your best,

427
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,910
even if only once,

428
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,130
for people like us

429
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,390
with average talent

430
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,420
is doing

431
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,540
a great thing.

432
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,950
But you denied this kind of effort

433
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,350
in the very beginning,

434
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,240
because you couldn't see the result.

435
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,620
From the bottom of your heart,

436
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,920
you deny the process of hard work.

437
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,180
But mathematicians

438
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,290
are not all geniuses.

439
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,260
Successful people

440
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,620
are not all smart either.

441
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,710
Score doesn't mean

442
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,780
everything.

443
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,460
No one can

444
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,920
decide our lives

445
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:32,990
with one test,

446
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,060
one paper,

447
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,520
or one score.

448
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,900
Especially not ourselves.

449
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,100
Now I understand.

450
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,470
No matter what the result

451
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,430
will be,

452
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,710
I will continue to study math.

453
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,690
I was afraid of the future,

454
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,660
destiny,

455
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:00,970
and hard work without gain.

456
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,410
But I'm not afraid now.

457
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,350
Lin Zhaoxi!

458
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,900
Lin Zhaoxi!

459
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,210
Let's go.

460
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,200
Wait a minute.

461
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:13,130
Wait!

462
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,820
Lin Zhaoxi, I'm here. Don't be afraid.

463
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,780
Sister.

464
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,450
Lin Zhaoxi.

465
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:17,580
You're great.

466
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:18,620
Wait.

467
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,540
Wait a minute.

468
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,340
Hello, who are you?

469
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:25,560
I'm Lin Zhaoxi's parent.

470
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,060
Are you Lin Zhaoxi's mom?

471
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:28,790
Yes.

472
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:29,860
I am also

473
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,340
the director of Red Star Children's Welfare House.

474
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,050
Lin Zhaoxi and Dang Aimin

475
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,140
are our children.

476
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,180
They are orphans.

477
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,280
That's right.

478
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:40,780
We're family.

479
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,270
We're here to take them home.

480
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:47,410
Thank you, director.

481
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:48,940
Thank you.

482
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,260
Lin Zhaoxi.

483
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:56,940
Master,

484
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,620
Let's take a paternity test.

485
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,330
You're not smarter than me,

486
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,310
but we share the same bad luck.

487
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:03,920
Maybe you're really my daughter.

488
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,530
No one can break the rules.

489
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,280
I don't care whose child she is.

490
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,630
I won't go easy on her.

491
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:43,740
You beat me up like this.

492
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:44,850
I still have to be your driver.

493
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,020
Shuping, calm down.

494
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,260
Why weren't you calm

495
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,040
when you hit me?

496
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,710
I hit you.

497
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:49,500
How about

498
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,140
hit me back later?

499
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,660
I can't do that, rogue.

500
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,680
Who are you calling a rogue?

501
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:53,430
Why are you so petty?

502
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:54,370
Just like when you were young.

503
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:56,180
You said it.

504
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:56,770
Hit you back later.

505
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,420
Yes.

506
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,740
Enough.

507
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,050
Don't fight in front of the kid.

508
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,000
Long Hair, let me ask you.

509
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,460
Did you know

510
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,670
Lin Zhaoxi is your daughter?

511
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:08,920
I don't know.

512
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,720
Otherwise, I wouldn't need a DNA test.

513
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:12,050
Then why did you

514
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,420
come to our orphanage

515
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,280
to check Lin Zhaoxi's information?

516
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,490
Did you know it?

517
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:18,820
Did you

518
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,100
abandoned Lin Zhaoxi?

519
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:20,530
I...

520
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,680
And now you regretted.

521
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,820
No, I really didn't know.

522
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,460
Don't act like you're interrogating a criminal.

523
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,340
Go ahead.

524
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,260
Director, let me tell you.

525
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,370
He has never been honest since he was young.

526
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:29,910
Interrogate him.

527
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:30,860
Drive straight.

528
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,740
Can't you see it you've crossed the line?

529
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:32,490
What line?

530
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,500
You do it.

531
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:33,900
I...

532
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,460
How many points will be deducted for crossing double yellow lines?

533
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:36,280
Have you ever driven a car?

534
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,340
The drivers beside you are watching you.

535
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,030
Your DNA test

536
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:44,970
is not judicially entrusted.

537
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,310
So please explain

538
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,870
why you want to do the DNA test.

539
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:49,550
Do I have to tell you?

540
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,260
Of course.

541
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:56,410
This child is an orphan.

542
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,420
She had a dream

543
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,070
that I was her dad.

544
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,500
We're here to confirm.

545
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,300
I'm from Red Star Welfare Home.

546
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,420
Lin Zhaoxi

547
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,620
is our child.

548
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,410
This gentleman might to be her father,

549
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:11,370
so we came here to verify it.

550
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:13,740
Fine.

551
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:14,900
You

552
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:16,160
fill out the information

553
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:17,540
and pay the money

554
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:18,760
and collect blood samples.

555
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,360
Okay.

556
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,310
No, I...

557
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,650
I'm not afraid of pain.

558
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,960
Please give me your hand.

559
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,340
Well...

560
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,950
Hurry up.

561
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,140
What? No.

562
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:35,250
Hurry up. You...

563
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,150
We are talking.

564
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,200
Well...

565
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,410
Sir, it really doesn't hurt.

566
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,680
Just one prick.

567
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,210
We need a little blood

568
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:43,100
on the gauze.

569
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:43,860
It really doesn't hurt.

570
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,600
You talk funny. I'm not afraid of pain.

571
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,610
I learned from

572
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,070
the TV that

573
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:48,620
hair

574
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,620
can be used

575
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:50,890
for DNA tests.

576
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,430
Look at my hair.

577
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:52,950
Right?

578
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,890
And nails

579
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:55,660
or oral cells.

580
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,620
I can provide them.

581
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:03,310
Lin Zhaoxi is a good girl.

582
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,330
The fact that she and Hua Juan

583
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,040
got into your camp

584
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,390
is an encouragement

585
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,220
to all the children

586
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,260
in the orphanage.

587
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:12,710
It made them feel

588
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:14,050
they are as good as others.

589
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,120
I know

590
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,040
Lin Zhaoxi

591
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:18,980
violated the rules.

592
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,680
It's reasonable for you to expel her.

593
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:26,320
But I still want you

594
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,140
to be lenient.

595
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,350
It's not easy for a kid like Lin Zhaoxi

596
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,910
to come this far.

597
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:37,980
Sir,

598
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,330
please cooperate.

599
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,410
Just one prick.

600
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,150
A man is afraid of pain?

601
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:42,580
No.

602
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,430
What are you talking about?

603
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,310
Em...

604
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,500
Wait for me outside.

605
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:47,670
I'm not leaving.

606
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,460
I'll stay here and watch you.

607
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,310
Look at me.

608
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:51,440
Wait for me outside. Hurry up.

609
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:52,530
It's pricking. Hurry up.

610
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,500
Wait for me.

611
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,840
Good luck, kid.

612
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,810
Be gentle.

613
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,770
Sister...

614
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:00,980
Reach out.

615
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,040
Be gentle.

616
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,460
Be gentle.

617
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,440
Be gentle, sister.

618
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:11,690
Look.

619
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,200
Where is Long Hair?

620
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,330
He's still inside.

621
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:17,700
Have a seat.

622
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,620
Lin Zhaoxi's guardian,

623
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,380
come with me.

624
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,220
We need to check

625
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,240
Lin Zhaoxi's information.

626
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,680
Okay, I'll go.

627
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,050
Lin Zhaoxi,

628
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,580
you said Lin Zhaosheng is your father?

629
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,620
Do you know who your mom is?

630
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,340
I only know her name is Qiu Yue.

631
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,210
She passed away when she gave birth to me.

632
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,180
You...

633
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,140
You asked me before

634
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,090
why I set

635
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:29,950
so many obstacles

636
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,170
for elimination.

637
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,220
I can tell you today.

638
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:40,860
It is actually a kind of comfort.

639
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,320
Comfort?

640
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,490
How can such a fierce elimination

641
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:48,360
be a comfort?

642
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,380
For children,

643
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,210
it's better to deny teachers

644
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,510
than your talent.

645
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,860
I don't understand.

646
00:32:59,380 --> 00:32:59,950
It's just that

647
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:03,590
some kids open the door when they get home:

648
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,620
Dad, my luggage is too heavy.

649
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,530
I ran upstairs with that luggage,

650
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,040
I won't have the strength to take the exam.

651
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,400
Mom,

652
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,670
I'm in one team

653
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,220
with a weak member.

654
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,210
He dragged me down.

655
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,860
I was eliminated.

656
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:20,770
And that grandma,

657
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:25,150
that teacher is too fierce.

658
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,610
I can't stand it anymore.

659
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,590
Trust me.

660
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,330
Almost all the eliminated children

661
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,730
would say that at home.

662
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,610
It's hard to admit

663
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:38,950
that you're not gifted.

664
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,350
It's not necessary either.

665
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,710
I don't need such comfort.

666
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,460
That's because you're mature

667
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:47,890
and talented.

668
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,530
Yes, you're right.

669
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,520
No one

670
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,520
can't deny their efforts.

671
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,780
But what they can't accept

672
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,980
is that

673
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:57,670
they worked hard

674
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,580
for a lot of time

675
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,740
but failed.

676
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,570
When you give up,

677
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,350
you need a reason.

678
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,300
I gave them this reason.

679
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,000
The teacher is not good enough.

680
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,500
This teacher is so cruel.

681
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,690
He's a devil.

682
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:15,210
You said I destroyed

683
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,850
their confidence in learning Mathematics Competition。

684
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:18,550
Maybe.

685
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,639
but it also stopped them from

686
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,710
doing things that are not for them.

687
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,170
But Mr. Zhang,

688
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:38,600
do you ever wonder

689
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,260
the reason why we give up so easily

690
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:42,550
when we grow up

691
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:43,120
might be that

692
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:44,690
we were comforted so many times when we were young.

693
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:47,300
I did.

694
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,670
But there's one thing

695
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,580
you can't get over.

696
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,890
Mathematics Competition training camp

697
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,480
is not a basic school.

698
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,260
It's cruel.

699
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,580
There aren't so many ways to pay hard work.

700
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:16,190
Many things

701
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,530
should be rewarded.

702
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,210
You, Pei Zhi, Zhang Liang,

703
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,090
you may still participate

704
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,380
in the future.

705
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:27,030
National competitions,

706
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,710
or even international competitions.

707
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:30,910
Do you think Yu Tianjiao

708
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,100
and Zou Wenchao

709
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,040
will be able to participate?

710
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,670
I've been teaching

711
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,580
for ten years.

712
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:42,530
I'm sorry.

713
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:44,110
I really

714
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,260
can't be touched

715
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,220
because

716
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,770
someone worked very hard.

717
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:49,330
I can't do it.

718
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,710
I've seen too many kids

719
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,630
who cried and collapsed.

720
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,710
They worked hard too.

721
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,000
They've been climbing for a long time.

722
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:57,620
But they could only

723
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:58,780
reach someone else's starting line.

724
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,460
That is cruel.

725
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:04,910
Really.

726
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:07,830
They will give up

727
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:09,520
sooner or later.

728
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:12,650
But I sincerely hope

729
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,410
you won't give up on math.

730
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,300
Because you are talented

731
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,000
and persistent,

732
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:20,790
In other people's eyes,

733
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,030
a teacher like me

734
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,600
should not exist.

735
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,640
You won't give up math,

736
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:33,670
right?

737
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:36,730
No.

738
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,430
Just like your mom.

739
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:44,950
You know my mom?

740
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,490
I can give you another chance.

741
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,440
The last elimination exam.

742
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:55,340
If the average score

743
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,180
of your and Pei Zhi’s team

744
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,420
is higher than Zhang Liang’s,

745
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,940
you can stay.

746
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:00,860
Otherwise,

747
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:01,990
the twelve of you will leave together.

748
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:03,860
You can ask

749
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,140
ask their opinion.

750
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,420
Mr. Zhang,

751
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:13,670
only three groups

752
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,660
can stay.

753
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,150
Since it's

754
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,340
the average score of the twelve of us,

755
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,190
Can you treat us

756
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,140
as one team?

757
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:20,880
If we surpass Zhang Liang's team,

758
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,220
we will take one spot

759
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,160
in the end.

760
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:27,440
OK.

761
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,340
Mr. Zhang,

762
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:36,820
Do you know that

763
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,010
we call you Snape in private?

764
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:40,300
I seem to have heard of that.

765
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:41,440
Who's Snape?

766
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,260
It's a character

767
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,060
in Harry Potter.

768
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:46,280
I

769
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,580
never watched it.

770
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,180
But since it’s my nickname.

771
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,690
I'm sure he's annoying too.

772
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,480
He's annoying sometimes.

773
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,260
But he is a good man.

774
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,470
Mr. Zhang,

775
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:21,920
I hope you can think about

776
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,660
what I just said.

777
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,230
I won't go back

778
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,100
with you.

779
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,900
When the result is out,

780
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,630
you can come to me

781
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,660
to discuss the follow-up.

782
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,780
Zhaoxi, goodbye.

783
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,150
Goodbye, Mrs. Li.

784
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:37,530
See you, Miss Li.

785
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,040
OK.

786
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:38,470
Thank you.

787
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,340
How long has it been since you returned to Yongchuan?

788
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,020
More than ten years.

789
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:53,900
I've never been back.

790
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,300
Not even once?

791
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:57,330
It's the Qingming Festival.

792
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:58,300
Why don't you go back?

793
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,350
Good for you.

794
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,440
Swearing

795
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:02,680
in front of my daughter.

796
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,500
The result of the DNA test hasn't come out yet.

797
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,300
How can you be sure she's your daughter?

798
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,620
Probably.

799
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,260
Don't you think

800
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:11,620
she looks like Qiu Yue?

801
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,990
Her personality, right?

802
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,020
What’s decided

803
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,950
can't be stopped.

804
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:29,490
You may leave.

805
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:30,920
We haven't arrived yet.

806
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:31,460
I know.

807
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,310
Walk back on your own.

808
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,220
Crazy.

809
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:36,780
Let's go.

810
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,040
Crazy. Don’t hit the tree again.

811
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,690
Thank you for giving us a ride.

812
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:50,280
Let's go.

813
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,730
I'll make a call.

814
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:14,500
I...

815
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:16,940
Lin Zhaosheng.

816
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,740
Let me ask you.

817
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,280
There's a little girl called Lin Zhaoxi.

818
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:24,740
She said she's my daughter.

819
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,230
We just came out

820
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,780
from the DNA lab.

821
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,180
I want to ask you

822
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,560
how likely is it

823
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,820
that we could be related?

824
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:46,810
Got it.

825
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,530
Who is it?

826
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:09,160
Is it the person

827
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,060
who sent me to the orphanage?

828
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:13,560
It's all in the past.

829
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,450
I'm sorry.

830
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,280
for not raising you.

831
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,600
It's not your fault.

832
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,060
You're wearing the right outfit.

833
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,180
Let me introduce myself again.

834
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,470
My name is Lin Zhaosheng.

835
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:34,720
I'm your dad.

836
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:38,700
I'll take care of you from now on.

837
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:52,800
Dad, wait for me.

838
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:55,060
I should have taken care of you.

839
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,070
Is master really your father?

840
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,310
DNA test

841
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,060
is not that fast.

842
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,180
Sometimes,

843
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:35,050
love is more accurate than science.

844
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:36,140
Congratulations.

845
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,140
Thank you.

846
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,140
Let's discuss

847
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,320
what Mr. Zhang said.

848
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:41,380
I agree.

849
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,190
It's just Zhang Liang.

850
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:42,780
Get him!

851
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,340
-I agree. -Me too.

852
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:46,560
Let's do it again.

853
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:50,850
Come on. One, two, three. Come on.

854
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,640
Come on.

855
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:53,500
OK.

856
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:54,520
Go back to

857
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,430
your seats.

858
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,100
Let's start the review.
