4
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,229
He's your deskmate.

5
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,340
You want me to take you to him?

6
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,770
I am in the same class with him?

7
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,610
We are all in the same class.

8
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,030
I am in the same class with you too?

9
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,120
Yes.

10
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,300
Where is the classroom?

11
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,640
What's wrong with you?

12
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,480
Xi, you went to the wrong side.

13
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:16,620
Zhang Liang.

14
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,380
Come up and solve this question.

15
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,220
Lu Zhihao.

16
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,130
You solve this question.

Lin Zhaoxi.

18
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,829
Excuse me.

19
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,530
Who are you looking for?

20
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,420
Sorry, Miss.

21
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,700
We're in the wrong class.

22
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,410
Let's go.

23
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,540
We went to the wrong class?

24
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,220
Yes.

25
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,820
Why did you go to Class 1?

26
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,070
Aren't I in Class 1?

27
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,840
We are from Class 13.

28
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,130
Class 13?

29
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,420
With the worst grades?

30
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,020
No, with our grades,

31
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,079
where can we be

32
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,079
if not Class 13?

33
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,790
When I was in primary school,

34
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,570
I won a gold metal for the Olympic mathematics.

35
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,690
Your grades are so bad now.

36
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,840
Did you really win a gold metal for the Olympic mathematics?

37
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,890
I asked you before, but you didn't admit it.

38
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,470
Where is Pei Zhi?

39
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,100
Why is Pei Zhi in Class 13?

40
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,320
In order to be in your class,

41
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,630
he turned in blank papers for three subjects for every exam

42
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,490
and ranked at the bottom on purpose.

43
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,860
The whole school knows about this.

44
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,520
Where is Class 13?

45
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:41,650
Well.

46
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,100
-What’s wrong with you? -Are we friends?

47
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,420
I'll explain later.

48
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:44,910
Which way?

49
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,110
Let's go.

50
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,560
Excuse me.

51
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,360
Watch out.

52
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,570
We're here.

53
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:08,100
Let's get in.

54
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,580
Xi.

55
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,620
I heard that you fainted while running in PE class.

56
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,810
You're so weak.

57
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,030
Exercise more.

58
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,790
Get lost.

59
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,269
Let's go.

60
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,560
Where do I sit?

61
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,330
Here.

62
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,340
Pei Zhi is next to you.

63
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:25,640
Where is Pei Zhi?

64
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,640
I don't know.

65
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,240
Maybe he'll be back soon.

66
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:30,380
Xiaomeng.

67
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:31,500
Come here.

68
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,170
What's wrong with her?

69
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:35,580
Don't ask me.

70
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,710
I know nothing.

71
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:03,870
Stand up.

72
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,670
Hello, everyone.

73
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,560
Hello, Sir.

74
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,510
Hello, everyone. Have a seat.

75
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:13,690
Come on.

76
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,700
Let's take out

77
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,810
the paper

78
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,510
that we haven't finished explaining.

79
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,620
-Let’s continue. -Why hasn’t Pei Zhi come back?

80
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,110
Where did we leave off?

81
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,910
Question 11.

82
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:23,910
Question 11.

83
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,870
Question 11, right?

84
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,920
Okay, let's start from

85
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,670
question 11.

86
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,100
Lin Zhaoxi.

87
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,510
Let's start with you.

88
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,940
One question each, and start from you.

89
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:40,890
Where is your paper?

90
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,090
Take it out.

91
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,140
What are you waiting for?

92
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,000
Come on, question 11. Hurry up.

93
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,560
The answer is C.

94
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,110
Yes.

95
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,510
The correct answer of this question

96
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,390
is C.

97
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,630
Tell us

98
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,540
why you chose C.

99
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,060
Don't be afraid of making mistakes.

100
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,170
Please share with us

101
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,140
your train of thought.

102
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,870
This is an attributive clause, right?

103
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,820
So I chose...

104
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,820
An attributive clause?

105
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,120
An attributive clause? What does that mean?

106
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,070
Lin Zhaoxi.

107
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:22,900
We're in chemistry class.

108
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,420
Are you kidding me

109
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:25,600
with an English paper?

110
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,890
So Lin Zhaoxi didn't play stupid,

111
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,520
she's really stupid.

112
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:33,980
Enough.

113
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:35,700
Sir.

114
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,090
Lin Zhaoxi had a heatstroke in PE class.

115
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,270
She hasn't fully recovered yet.

116
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,010
She must be confused.

117
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,280
So you're sick?

118
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,610
Okay, sit down.

119
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,400
Well, the student behind her,

120
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,659
please explain

121
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:47,300
question 11 to us.

122
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,870
Sir, I'm not feeling well.

123
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,940
I need to go out.

124
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,280
What's wrong with her?

125
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,870
Sir, can I go check on her?

126
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,820
Okay, go ahead.

127
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,270
Call your head teacher if you need anything.

128
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,140
I know.

129
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,680
Enough.

130
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,380
Stop talking.

131
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,660
A classmate is sick,

132
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,770
and you were activated.

133
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,580
So restless.

134
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,150
Well, the student behind her,

135
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,720
go on with the question 11.

136
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,400
The student behind her.

137
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,800
Question 11, hurry up.

138
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,180
Sir, the answer for question 11 is B.

139
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,020
C.

140
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,050
Stop.

141
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,290
We just said the answer is C.

142
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,090
Why are you saying B?

143
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,550
What were you listening to?

144
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,630
The answer is C.

145
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,710
This is the problem of Class 13.

146
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,990
One ear in, and the other out!

147
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:46,780
Next question.

148
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,159
Xi.

149
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,200
Slow down.

150
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,370
Is the class over? Where are you going?

151
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,700
Why are you here?

152
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,360
I'm work here.

153
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,150
Are you the guard?

154
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,890
What should I do with you?

155
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,550
What should I do with you?

156
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,670
Are you still confused?

157
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,500
Have you seen Pei Zhi?

158
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,510
What?

159
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,410
Pei Zhi should be home, right?

160
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,660
Let me out, dad.

161
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,330
I'm looking for him.

162
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,580
Why?

163
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,170
Is it lunch time? Go back to class.

164
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,260
No, let me out first, dad.

165
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,090
-Go back. -Lin Zhaoxi.

166
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,910
You ran too fast.

167
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,429
What's wrong with you?

168
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,010
The teacher asked me to come out

169
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,230
to check on her.

170
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,049
Come down. What are you doing?

171
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,220
Uncle Lin.

172
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:41,559
Lin Zhaoxi is really weird.

173
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:44,280
We should go to the hospital.

174
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,160
No, dad.

175
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,870
I just have a stomachache.

176
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,460
I want to go out and eat something.

177
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,920
Can Xiaomeng come with me?

178
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,710
What time is it now?

179
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,020
The fourth class in the morning.

180
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,850
It's almost noon break.

181
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,700
Uncle Lin, I can accompany Xi

182
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:58,610
for lunch.

183
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,950
You don't like to study, right?

184
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,430
Go.

185
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,170
I feel so tired.

186
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:09,990
Come back.

187
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,010
Eat something good and come back early.

188
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,650
Thank you, dad.

189
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,200
Uncle Lin is so nice.

190
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,600
Come with me.

191
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,030
Mom.

192
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:10,530
Mom.

193
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,320
Why are you here?

194
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,240
Mom.

195
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,230
You look younger.

196
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,290
What's this all of a sudden?

197
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:29,960
Don't you have classes this afternoon?

198
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,230
The school is closed in the afternoon.

199
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,560
Where's your bag?

200
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:34,130
Mom.

201
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,440
Where's my dad?

202
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,110
He was on night shift last night.

203
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,170
He should be back soon.

204
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,910
Hurry, wash your hands and eat.

205
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,350
The meal is ready.

206
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,420
You're back.

207
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:10,480
Dad.

208
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,390
Why are you back?

209
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:28,640
Dad.

210
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:31,810
You...

211
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,300
You look so good.

212
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,050
Look good?

213
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,890
I didn't sleep because of three accidents.

214
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,250
I need to pee. I can't hold it anymore.

215
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,260
I'll start eating, then.

216
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,070
Help yourself.

217
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,220
When you eat,

218
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,900
you have to answer my questions.

219
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,180
First, you have to tell me

220
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,330
what's wrong with you.

221
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,290
Are you sure you want to listen?

222
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,820
Then,

223
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,100
I'll have to start from

224
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,740
the 1950s.

225
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,780
When physicists

226
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,030
study quantum,

227
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,340
they find that

228
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,180
the state of each quantum is different.

229
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:40,830
Do you know that

230
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,490
everything in the universe

231
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,680
are made of quantum?

232
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,300
So they had a hypothesis.

233
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,910
Since the state of each quantum

234
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,700
is different,

235
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,070
then is it possible that

236
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,540
instead of one universe,

237
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,210
there are

238
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,600
several similar universes.

239
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:01,280
Okay.

240
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:04,410
I... I lost my memory.

241
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,360
Do you think you're the heroine of a Korean drama?

242
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,460
Did you really lose your memory?

243
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,940
You'll lose your memory if you have heatstroke?

244
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,470
I didn't have a heatstroke.

245
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,920
Yes, I really lost my memory.

246
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:20,380
Well,

247
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,020
I have Alzheimer's disease.

248
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,550
Do you know?

249
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,700
Go to the hospital if you're sick.

250
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,660
No, I can't go.

251
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,360
Why?

252
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,950
If I go,

253
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,940
everyone will worry about me.

254
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,540
Right?

255
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,280
That won't do.

256
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,060
You're the only one who knows this.

257
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,180
You have to keep it a secret for me.

258
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,380
Pei Zhi doesn't know either?

259
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,320
He doesn't know yet.

260
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,820
Such a big secret,

261
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,630
you only told me? -Yes.

262
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,490
You're really my best friend.

263
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:50,470
Don't worry.

264
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,220
I won't tell anyone.

265
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:51,930
Really?

266
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,390
It's a deal then.

267
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,630
From now on,

268
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,760
can you answer my questions?

269
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,280
OK.

270
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,740
When did we meet?

271
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:00,860
In the first year of high school,

272
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,860
we were in the same class.

273
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,470
Was I in Class 13

274
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,670
from the beginning?

275
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,540
I didn't get good grades in the high school entrance exam?

276
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,510
Just like me.

277
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:10,790
It's just so-so.

278
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,690
So my grades were not good in middle school.

279
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:14,990
When did my dad

280
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:15,940
start working at school?

281
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,250
When I met you,

282
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,110
Uncle Lin was working

283
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:18,900
in the mail room at our school.

284
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,870
It seems that Uncle Lin will work

285
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,140
wherever you go to school.

286
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:23,980
You were quite annoyed at that time.

287
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,430
You said he might as well keep an eye on your brother.

288
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,600
I have a brother?

289
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,460
Lin Aimin.

290
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,890
You even forgot your brother?

291
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,570
Ji Jiang, Hua Juan?

292
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,430
Who is Ji Jiang?

293
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,730
Your brother’s nickname seems to be Hua Juan.

294
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,380
That must be...

295
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,110
What’s the situation with Pei Zhi?

296
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,780
He was at Class 13 from the beginning too?

297
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,970
How is that possible?

298
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,670
Pei Zhi ranked No.1 in the high school entrance exam

299
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,900
in our city.

300
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,390
Eat slowly.

301
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,040
Save some for him.

302
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,110
There is plenty left.

303
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,920
No matter how much is left,

304
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,330
little will be left with your speed.

305
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,380
Fine.

306
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,280
I'll take my time.

307
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,950
Come on.

308
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,530
I didn't ask you to be so slow.

309
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,870
Your mom has no sense of humor

310
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,500
at all.

311
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,330
Mom, these dishes are so delicious.

312
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,400
I'll get another bowl of rice.

313
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,060
Looks like my cooking skills have improved.

314
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,580
He usually

315
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,260
can't even finish one bowl of rice.

316
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,140
Now he has added twice.

317
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,360
Definitely.

318
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,630
When are you going to do the thing

319
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,000
I told you the day before yesterday?

320
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,630
What thing?

321
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,520
The visit to Zhang Liang's father.

322
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,700
I've bought the gift.

323
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,430
I'm not going.

324
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,660
Didn't we agree?

325
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,580
You agreed,

326
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,400
but I didn't.

327
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,140
Besides, it might not work.

328
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,460
Why not?

329
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,630
Zhang Liang’s father’s brother-in-law

330
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,980
and your director are best friends.

331
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,040
And you...

332
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,050
Don’t you need help

333
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,210
if you want a job transfer?

334
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:31,670
Besides,

335
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,590
you said that

336
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,600
you want to enjoy your life.

337
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,790
Do you want to work on the front line

338
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,860
until you retire?

339
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,910
I'm very satisfied with my current state.

340
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,170
I think it's good.

341
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,540
I'm not satisfied.

342
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,780
Have you forgotten the incident three years ago?

343
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,190
You were lucky that time.

344
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,630
We were so scared.

345
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:47,900
Three years ago?

346
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,150
What happened?

347
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,510
That time,

348
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,340
your dad was chasing a thief on a motorcycle.

349
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,180
That time,

350
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:55,950
he bumped his head

351
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,300
on the road.

352
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,630
Luckily, you had a helmet.

353
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,740
Otherwise, you're done for.

354
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:00,500
Helmet?

355
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,260
Didn't you two fight back then?

356
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,329
What are you talking about?

357
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,140
Fine.

358
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,000
Study, study, study.

[Lin Zhaoxi 14 years old]

361
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,010
-Study what? -No.

362
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:11,069
Why are you lashing on these books?

363
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,690
I won't let him study math.

364
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,990
He is only a 12th grade high school student.

365
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,740
You asked him to study

366
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,140
Math of Juvenile University.

367
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:16,740
Our son

368
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,740
is a math genius.

369
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,890
What kind of math genius is he?

370
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:19,660
You have the say for everything?

371
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,020
-You have to arrange everything? -Of course.

372
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,800
I'm his mom.

373
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:23,319
Okay, it’s all up to you.

374
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,330
You...

375
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,230
Nuts.

376
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,630
I won't always be on the front line.

377
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,670
When I get old,

378
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,900
the team will make arrangements.

379
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,200
If you are capable,

380
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,650
you should get a promotion.

381
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,170
In the future, sit in the office

382
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,070
like Cao

383
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,550
so that

384
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,940
you won’t have to run on the street.

385
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,250
So,

386
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,650
in order to urge me to study,

387
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,890
he got low grades on purpose to stay in Class 13.

388
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,020
Yes.

389
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,630
The teacher doesn't care?

390
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,720
It's said that the principal has taken action.

391
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:20,710
But Pei Zhi

392
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,050
chose to stay in Class 13.

393
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,140
Later, they found that

394
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:23,980
Pei Zhi can study well everywhere.

395
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,580
It's the same.

396
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,440
So they let him be.

397
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,970
Little Pei Zhi.

398
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,350
Well, what's the situation

399
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,350
between me and Pei Zhi?

400
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,100
You two are weird.

401
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,270
You’re not

402
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,380
a couple.

403
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,100
What's going on?

404
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,150
Didn't he submit the blank paper for me?

405
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,330
How would I know about you?

406
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,350
Don't you like Zheng Tianming?

407
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:55,890
Zheng Tianming?

408
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,700
Yes.

409
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:57,600
Who is he?

410
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,600
Zheng Tianming.

411
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:01,830
My deskmate.

412
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,750
The one who dissed you in recess.

413
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,480
Him...

414
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,230
I like him?

415
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:08,970
Yes.

416
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,170
No way.

417
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,880
What's wrong with my head?

418
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,830
How could I like him?

419
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,220
No.

420
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,980
Zheng Tianming is good.

421
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,990
He's just bad at studying.

422
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,300
He's nice

423
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,460
and funny.

424
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,040
He's good in basketball.

425
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,890
I'll leave the handsome guy to you.

426
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:30,970
OK?

427
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,670
You said

428
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:33,950
he looks like a star.

429
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:35,780
Fine.

430
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,550
Are you testing me?

431
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,460
Don't worry.

432
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,140
I won't

433
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,150
take Zheng Tianming away from you,

434
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:44,520
although

435
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,830
I think

436
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:49,550
he's quite nice.

437
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,290
Boss, we’re ready to pay the bill.

438
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,740
I'll leave first, you pay the bill.

439
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,650
Go back to school?

440
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,270
I'm going to Pei Zhi's house.

441
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,620
What about the afternoon classes?

442
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,230
We'll see. I don't have time.

443
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,260
Pay for me.

444
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,050
I'm leaving.

445
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,780
What about the change?

446
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,710
Keep it.

447
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,780
Consider it a payment for knowledge.

448
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,820
Bye, Xiaomeng.

449
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,710
What happened?

450
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:13,730
Is she angry?

451
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,270
Let me help you.

452
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:40,870
No need.

453
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,820
Don't get your hands dirty.

454
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,860
Go and rest over there.

455
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,980
I'll go back to school in the afternoon.

456
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:46,850
When will you be back?

457
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,980
I'll be back after class.

458
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,140
Didn't you say you're on holiday?

459
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,560
I lied.

460
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:54,900
I just missed you two,

461
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:56,440
so I came back to see you.

462
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,570
What's this all of a sudden?

463
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,890
Did you cause trouble at school?

464
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,050
No.

465
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,580
Did your teacher criticize you?

466
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:03,570
No.

467
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,480
Nothing else?

468
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,190
No.

469
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,060
I just missed you.

470
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:08,970
Go now.

471
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:09,780
It's already 1 p.m.

472
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,820
You'll be late.

473
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,560
Which country won the World Cup

474
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,660
in 2014?

475
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,140
On July 14,

476
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,060
the German team defeated Argentina

477
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,830
overtime game with 1:0.

478
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,590
The German team won.

479
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,640
You really came.

480
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,580
You too.

481
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,320
What's wrong?

482
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,810
Are you worried about Master?

483
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,060
I...

484
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:31,700
I've been looking for you

485
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,020
since I woke up.

486
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,460
I'm sorry

487
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,460
I didn't look for you immediately.

488
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:37,720
I was in a hurry to go home

489
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,780
to check on my dad.

490
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,930
Is he okay?

491
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,380
We had lunch together.

492
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:48,670
Like you said,

493
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:49,370
my dad is still alive

494
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,190
in this world.

495
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,540
Thank you, Xi.

496
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,260
Without you,

497
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,660
I wouldn't have seen my dad again.

498
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:00,700
That's good.

499
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,660
I'm sorry.

500
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:13,590
I didn't expect

501
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,310
this would happen

502
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,320
when erasing the formula.

503
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,510
I should have accompanied you

504
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,100
to find master.

505
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,460
No one would have thought this would happen.

506
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,060
Do you still have the recorder?

507
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:24,990
When I woke up,

508
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,780
it was in my pocket.

509
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,760
It seems that the recorder

510
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,510
serves a similar function

511
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,380
as the photo.

512
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,210
It’s September 2012 now.

513
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,900
The recorder says

514
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,050
February 2013.

515
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,150
We have 5 months left.

516
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,360
You have to find out

517
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,720
everything about the recording.

518
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,440
Otherwise, we won't be able to

519
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,130
go back to the strawberry world.

520
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,560
Lin Zhaoxi.

521
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,620
The master of this world

522
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,320
is a guard at the school gate.

523
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:58,620
I bumped into him just now.

524
00:23:59,020 --> 00:23:59,700
What's wrong?

525
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:04,670
The two worlds

526
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,740
are different in many ways.

527
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,280
You were Class 1,

528
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,150
and I was in Class 3.

529
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,340
Now both of us

530
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,780
are in the worst one, Class 13.

531
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,820
There are also some changes

532
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:16,830
in our relationships with

533
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:17,650
teachers, students, and friends.

534
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,750
When I went there,

535
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,980
I was so confused.

536
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,660
Xi,

537
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,660
I mean,

538
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,430
since we

539
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,630
live in this world,

540
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,260
we have to fit in as soon as possible.

541
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,060
We should go to school.

542
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,280
Let’s go back to school first.

543
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:44,140
Show me the situation of Class 13.

544
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,940
I'm not sure.

545
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,020
Luckily,

546
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,030
Bao Xiaomeng is in that class too.

547
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:54,420
Dad.

548
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,190
What took you so long? What time is it?

549
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,170
I'm going to class.

550
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,510
Pei Zhi, keep an eye on her.

551
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,740
Got it, master.

552
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:15,850
It should be right ahead.

553
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,500
Lin Zhaoxi, Pei Zhi.

554
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,020
Mr. Xie.

555
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,870
Come to my office.

556
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:28,820
I met him once.

557
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,060
When I was young,

558
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:31,300
he was the assistant of the Olympic mathematics training camp.

559
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,900
You still remember it after so many years?

560
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,740
He looks like our teacher.

561
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,470
Head teacher? Or subject teacher?

562
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,490
I don't know.

563
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,250
Class 13 and Class 1

564
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,600
have different teachers.

565
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,340
Be flexible.

566
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,920
Don't worry. I'm familiar with this.

567
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,780
I’ve experienced once.

568
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,490
The whole grade knows

569
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,030
I don’t work hard.

570
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,780
I'll be the head teacher when the leader asks me to.

571
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:57,270
The leader asked me to head the worst class,

572
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,020
so I became your head teacher.

573
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,400
I don’t have a temper.

574
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,590
I always smile when I see you.

575
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:02,450
But

576
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,690
you can't bully me like this.

577
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,380
Sir, who bullied you?

578
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:09,730
I always thought

579
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,770
you are in Grade 12 now,

580
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,030
and you're already 17 years old.

581
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,300
You should have

582
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,540
your own judgement on things.

583
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,300
But this time,

584
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,420
you’ve gone too far.

585
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:18,760
You didn't ask for leave.

586
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,380
You skipped class and came back late.

587
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,140
Tell me the reason.

588
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,060
Because...

589
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,590
I...

590
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:32,530
What are you doing?

591
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,320
What are you looking at?

592
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,180
Are you giving hints in front of me?

593
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:37,900
Sir.

594
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,350
I know

595
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,500
you may be worried that

596
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,040
our grades will decline.

597
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,540
Decline? Is there still room for her to decline?

598
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,720
She's already at the bottom of her grade.

599
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:48,780
Don't worry.

600
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,770
I believe Lin Zhaoxi's grades

601
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,260
will improve soon.

602
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,060
Pei Zhi,

603
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,620
I know

604
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,480
you’re helping her

605
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:00,090
during the spare time.

606
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,000
But you saw the result.

607
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,640
It's useless.

608
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,350
You...

609
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:09,410
Let alone others.

610
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,450
If you go on like this,

611
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,560
can you live up to your dad’s expectations?

612
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,570
Sir, I'm sorry.

613
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,680
I'll try my best.

614
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,760
Lin Zhaoxi.

615
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,310
Although so many years have passed,

616
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:24,670
I clearly remember

617
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,010
how smart you were

618
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,850
when you were young.

619
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,020
Back then...

620
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,810
Look at you now.

621
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,500
Anyway, let me tell you something.

622
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:36,670
If you

623
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,740
give up on yourself,

624
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,430
no matter how good a teacher is,

625
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,220
it's useless.

626
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:53,760
Forget it. Go back to the class.

627
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,140
Pei Zhi, stay here.

628
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:56,090
I have something to tell you.

629
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,010
Goodbye.

630
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,370
Sit.

631
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,490
Considering your Olympics mathematics grades

632
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,970
in the last two years,

633
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,440
the Mathematics Department of Sanwei University

634
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,300
is calling for you.

635
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:16,980
If it goes well,

636
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,160
you should be able to be

637
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,240
recommended to Sanwei University.

638
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,690
Yes. [A photo of Class 13 in the chorus competition of Experimental High School in Anping City]

639
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,280
As your head teacher,

640
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,500
I'm happy for you.

641
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,020
Congratulations in advance.

642
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,260
OK.

643
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,000
You can go to the best university

644
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,430
without the college entrance exam.

645
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,110
Aren't you happy?

646
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:37,430
Yes.

647
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,390
Next time,

648
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:41,670
don’t turn in blank papers.

649
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,260
Make your grades look better.

650
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,730
I'll talk to the principal.

651
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,470
If you want to stay in Class 13,

652
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,220
you can stay in Class 13.

653
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,980
You won't be transferred to a better class.

654
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,180
Sir,

655
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,180
can you do me a favor?

656
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:54,660
Why?

657
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,180
Do you have this photo?

658
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,000
A group photo of our class.

659
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:02,060
Yes.

660
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,500
Chen Zhu, commissary in charge of sports.

661
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:05,180
Well,

662
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,200
He used to be strong, but now he's lost weight.

663
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,940
He looks listless all day.

664
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,630
I heard he goes to the Internet cafe

665
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:13,490
after school every day.

666
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:15,660
Chen... Chen Zhu.

667
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,230
The girl with glasses

668
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,380
is Zhou Qian.

669
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,020
She likes to snitch.

670
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,060
No one likes her.

671
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,190
Zhou Qian.

672
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,210
What are you talking about?

673
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:31,770
Nothing.

674
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,640
Nothing.

675
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:35,160
Who?

676
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:36,650
Don't you remember?

677
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:41,100
Qi, Sun Wenqi.

678
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,370
Sun Wenqi.

679
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,860
Besides me,

680
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:45,980
she’s your best friend.

681
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:48,530
OK.

682
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,000
Sun Wenqi.

683
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,140
Lin Zhaoxi.

684
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,200
I'll go first.

685
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,340
It’s OK.

686
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,900
I got the photo

687
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:09,370
from Mr. Xie.

688
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,460
I’ve memorized it.

689
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,460
Take a look.

690
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,800
That's great.

691
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,390
When I'm in class,

692
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:14,850
I can

693
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,880
match everyone.

694
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,500
Pei Zhi,

695
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,940
don't forget to practice at night.

696
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,380
Extra training? Basketball?

697
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:25,210
Of course.

698
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,310
Didn't we agree?

699
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,830
We'll play against Class 1 tomorrow.

700
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,600
We can't lose to them.

701
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,500
When will we get off school?

702
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:34,010
6:40 p.m.

703
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,620
No evening class?

704
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,710
What evening class?

705
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,700
Isn't the evening class cancelled?

706
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,610
I remember the class

707
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:44,780
ends at 8:50 p.m..

708
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,100
In the Strawberry World,

709
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,460
the Education Bureau wants reduce the pressure.

710
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,640
Two weeks before Grade 3 started school,

711
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,340
the school canceled the evening classes

712
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,320
for the checkup.

713
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,150
Later,

714
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,120
because the parents don’t agree,

715
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:56,940
so they recovered.

716
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,380
On this point,

717
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,340
the two worlds are the same.

718
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:04,980
Where is this person?

719
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:07,760
The left side of table six of the first group.

720
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,080
And this?

721
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,060
Two students behind you.

722
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:17,740
What's wrong?

723
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,940
Nothing.

724
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,720
This?

725
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,460
Right on your left.

726
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,310
Nice shot!

727
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:45,580
Nice shot!

728
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:46,570
When did you practice it secretly?

729
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:47,900
For a few years.

730
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,840
Are you kidding me?

731
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,820
The basketball game of our grade?

732
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,690
I seem to remember this.

733
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,540
Was Class 3 eliminated in the first round?

734
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,370
Indeed, in the first round,

735
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,320
Class 3 was eliminated

736
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,070
Class 3

737
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:02,020
was eliminated by us last week.

738
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,180
We'll take Class 1 tomorrow.

739
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:04,820
Those people in Class 1

740
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,130
are so arrogant

741
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:06,970
and annoying.

742
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,740
Everyone in our class is trying their best.

743
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,580
We can’t

744
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,280
lose to those nerds.

745
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,500
Those who study well

746
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:18,880
are not necessarily nerds.

747
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,590
I was not talking about Pei Zhi.

748
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,140
I didn't say it was him.

749
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,630
Let's watch for a while.

750
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,200
It's time to practice.

751
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,600
Qi's house is so close.

752
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,890
She went for the recorder.

753
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,300
She should be back now.

754
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,580
What are you practicing?

755
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,420
Yeah.

756
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,870
Have you forgotten

757
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:42,990
our big plan?

758
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,620
Big plan?

759
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:46,550
Oh no.

760
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,390
Xiaomeng.

761
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:48,900
Qi.

762
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,800
I'm back.

763
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,880
Let's get started.

764
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,460
I have to teach Xi again.

765
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,210
Why?

766
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,470
This involves a big secret.

767
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,540
I can't tell you.

768
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,020
A secret? What secret?

769
00:32:59,050 --> 00:32:59,740
I want to hear it too.

770
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,370
It's a secret, so I can't tell you.

771
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,820
So what are we practicing?

772
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,010
Let's go.

773
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,810
Let's talk somewhere else.

774
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,350
Come on, be the blocker.

775
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,100
Let's start.

776
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:15,980
You're in the middle.

777
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:18,580
One, two, three, four.

778
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,040
Five, six, seven, eight.

779
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,650
Two, two, three, four.

780
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,470
Five, six, seven, eight.

781
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,170
I'm in the middle?

782
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:23,540
Yeah.

783
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,180
You watched us dance the first time,

784
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,490
and dance with us for the second time.

785
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,090
Understand?

786
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,910
Three, five, six, seven, eight.

787
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,130
No, no, no.

788
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,440
I can't.

789
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,200
Didn't we agree that

790
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,800
we’ll be the Q cheerleaders in school?

791
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:37,980
Q?

792
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,340
The cutest.

793
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:43,610
I...

794
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:44,970
Don't just stand there.

795
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,100
The basketball game is tomorrow.

796
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,060
We don't have much time

797
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:47,830
left.

798
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,380
Cheer on the basketball court?

799
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,340
When they take a break,

800
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,580
it’s our show time.

801
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,660
It's so embarrassing. I really can't do it.

802
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,980
We had a deal.

803
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,250
You even picked the song.

804
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:57,690
Yes.

805
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,100
You also said we’ll do

806
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,030
the retro dance.

807
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:00,810
No.

808
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,420
I really can't.

809
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,230
Xiaomeng, you know that

810
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:02,870
I'm in the right mind today.

811
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,260
I'll teach you little by little.

812
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,830
It's simple, Xi.

813
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:09,810
What's wrong with her?

814
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,380
She's sick.

815
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:13,139
You don't have to scold her.

816
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:16,270
No, she's really sick.

817
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:17,820
Forget it.

818
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,550
Let's practice our dance.

819
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,460
We can change it to a double dance.

820
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:19,900
Let's go.

821
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,230
I’m back.

822
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:23,940
Dad, sister.

823
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,790
You're back?

824
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,300
The meal is ready.

825
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:40,679
Why are you spacing out?

826
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,260
Put your bag down. Wash your hands and eat.

827
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:54,199
Do you have meat?

828
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:55,300
Yes.

829
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,610
Pork ribs.

830
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:02,860
Time to eat.

831
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,260
Coming.

832
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,200
You cook every day?

833
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,970
Are you trying to slack off again?

834
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,810
It's your turn to cook tomorrow.

835
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:34,870
We’re taking turns?

836
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:35,910
Yes.

837
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,140
Didn't we agree that

838
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,200
I'll cook on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays,

839
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:38,910
and you’ll cook on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays?

840
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,080
What about you?

841
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,580
I'll take you to the restaurant on Sundays.

842
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,560
Don't you cook?

843
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:44,590
No.

844
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,460
You've been raising two kids for six years,

845
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:49,240
and you don't cook?

846
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,290
Hua Juan,

847
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,950
your sister still

848
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:54,140
don’t agree with this distribution mode.

849
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,690
Should we do it the old way?

850
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,160
Later,

851
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,020
let's throw darts.

852
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:57,720
No.

853
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,820
She can throw ten rings with her eyes covered.

854
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:00,750
If throw darts,

855
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,700
I have to cook every day.

856
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,080
I have a competition.

857
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,290
I don't have time to practice singing.

858
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,260
A competition? What competition?

859
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,990
The Super Singer.

860
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,420
I told you before, sister.

861
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,370
What's wrong with you today?

862
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,140
Something is wrong.

863
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:17,340
Your sister passed out

864
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,440
at school today.

865
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,590
Are you okay?

866
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,610
I'm fine.

867
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,620
But I suspect your sister is pretending to be sick.

868
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:26,420
Dad.

869
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,620
How could you say that about my sister?

870
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,750
Although she is playful and lazy,

871
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,440
and doesn't study hard,

872
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,570
she doesn't lie.

873
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,930
I'm playful and lazy?

874
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:36,990
Are you talking about me?

875
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,130
I didn't say that.

876
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,100
Thank you, dad.

877
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,860
Good evening, everyone.

878
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,090
Today is Tuesday, September 25.

879
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,310
Let's watch the weather together.

880
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,090
Tomorrow,the rain

881
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:04,210
mainly falls on

882
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:04,920
the east of Sichuan

883
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,460
to the north of Anhui.

884
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,880
In the southeast of Henan

885
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,210
and Southeast Shaanxi

886
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:10,920
there will be heavy rain.

887
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,630
He said that in the rain

888
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,300
The pain is nothing

889
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,060
Wipe your tears and don't be afraid

890
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,850
At least we still have dreams

891
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:21,130
He said that in the rain

892
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:23,120
He said that in the rain

893
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,850
The pain is nothing

894
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,660
Wipe your tears and don't ask why

895
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,920
What are you yelling about?

896
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,100
Sister, why are you here?

897
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,900
I need to study.

898
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,800
I'm taking the book.

899
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,240
You need to study?

900
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,060
How long will you practice?

901
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,220
You need to study?

902
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,420
What's with that expression?

903
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,540
Can't I study?

904
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,710
Ever since high school,

905
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,070
you never touched your books at night.

906
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,700
Can't I change?

907
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,380
No.

908
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:55,410
What are you doing?

909
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,600
What do you mean?

910
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:01,740
Sister, what's wrong with you?

911
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,020
No, hurry up and practice.

912
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,590
How long will it take?

913
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,750
Should I leave now?

914
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,620
No need. You practice first.

915
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,000
Just give me a time.

916
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,860
I'm going out.

917
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,910
I'm afraid you'll tear me apart too.

918
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,350
Why would I do that?

919
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:19,940
How long will you practice?

920
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,740
One hour.

921
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,300
Okay.

922
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:27,820
Sister,

923
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,790
it's your turn to cook tomorrow.

924
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:34,050
Okay.

925
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,890
Okay.

926
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,070
He said in the rain

927
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,700
The pain is nothing

928
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,560
Wipe your tears and don't be afraid

929
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,270
What's going on?

930
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,220
He said in the rain

931
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,970
The pain is nothing

932
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:10,590
Wipe your tears and don't ask why

933
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,090
You've improved.

934
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,980
Hold on for 30 seconds this time.

935
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,400
Most importantly,

936
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,450
high school math is too simple.

937
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:33,230
It doesn't suit me.

938
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:34,660
What you said

939
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:35,980
is 70% like me.

940
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:37,380
You believe everything I say?

941
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,180
I mean you are praising yourself.

942
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,600
Let me ask you something.

943
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,090
This...

944
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:47,700
Thank you.

945
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:52,480
Didn't he learn acting?

946
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:53,190
Why did he participate

947
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,260
in a singing competition?

948
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,620
You signed up for it.

949
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,230
Does the strawberry world

950
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,260
rely on sound fixing?

951
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,660
What strawberry world?

952
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:02,710
Nothing.

953
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,760
I just want to ask

954
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,410
what kind of attitude you have as a parent.

955
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,020
I support him.

956
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,100
As long as it's not against the law,

957
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,420
I will support you.

958
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:15,090
You also support skipping classes?

959
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:15,760
No,

960
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:18,630
I’m in the 12th grade,

961
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:19,820
and my grades are so bad,

962
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:20,410
you don't care?

963
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,730
But you don’t listen to me.

964
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:23,570
I didn’t listen?

965
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,950
Didn’t we agree that

966
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:27,610
even if I give up math,

967
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:28,710
you won't give up on me,

968
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,490
and you will force me to learn?

969
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,020
You remember now?

970
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:31,780
Back then,

971
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,710
when I forced you to study math,

972
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,300
you didn’t admit that

973
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,180
you said that.

974
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:38,100
I've grown up.

975
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,220
My rebellious phase is over.

976
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,150
Okay, I wish

977
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,900
you can keep it for three days.

978
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:44,980
Wait.

979
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,230
Is your phone here?

980
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,260
Is it on the table?

981
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,020
I'll call Pei Zhi.

982
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,410
Thanks.

983
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,950
You're rebellious in another way

984
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,780
Wipe your tears and don't be afraid

985
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,580
At least we still have dreams

986
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,350
He said in the rain

987
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,820
Hua Juan, keep your voice down.

988
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:04,020
Wipe your tears

989
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,310
and don’t ask why

990
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,980
Why do I feel

991
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,730
something is wrong with Pei Zhi today?

992
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:14,940
What's wrong?

993
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,020
He seemed weird when he came back at noon.

994
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,170
He told me the school was on holiday.

995
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,010
Then he said

996
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,820
he lied.

997
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:27,030
He said he came back

998
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:27,930
because he missed us.

999
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,810
We stay at home every day.

1000
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:30,820
What's there to miss about?

1001
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,760
What's wrong with that?

1002
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,620
It means that we are

1003
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,690
in his heart.

1004
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,620
I still feel something is wrong.

1005
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,140
But I can't tell where it is.

1006
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,480
Anyway,

1007
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,350
Pei Zhi changed a lot.

1008
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,390
You're oversensitive.

1009
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,060
Rest early.

1010
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:52,290
Here.

1011
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:54,710
Dad, mom.

1012
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:55,430
Pei Zhi.

1013
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,200
Do you want to play cards?

1014
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:58,970
Come on.

1015
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,370
You’re energetic when you hear play.

1016
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,100
I'm accompanying my son.

1017
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:13,930
Hello, Mr. Lin.

1018
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,500
Lin.

1019
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,790
Wait a moment.

1020
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:19,780
It's for you.

1021
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:20,570
For you.

1022
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:23,940
Hello.

1023
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,050
Pei Zhi.

1024
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:27,850
How is it going over there?

1025
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,290
I'm fine.

1026
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,140
What about you?

1027
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:35,690
It's a bit complicated here.

1028
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,010
I seem to be rebellious.

1029
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:38,810
But Lin

1030
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,840
has given up taking care of me.

1031
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,660
Most importantly,

1032
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,390
Ji Jiang became my brother.

1033
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:44,420
What happened?

1034
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:45,980
I don't know.

1035
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,300
Maybe it's the result

1036
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:49,810
from last time.

1037
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,410
But I'm thinking

1038
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,370
in the strawberry world,

1039
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:54,470
at this time,

1040
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,200
Hua Juan has started to shoot commercials

1041
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:56,750
and became popular.

1042
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:57,430
But now,

1043
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,530
he still has nothing.

1044
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,850
He still likes singing.

1045
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:02,120
He even wants to participate in the competition.
