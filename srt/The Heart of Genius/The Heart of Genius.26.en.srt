00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,330
One time, Professor Dugdon told me something.

518
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,170
You do inherit

519
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,400
the genes of schizophrenia.

520
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,740
But I think

521
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,120
the symptoms you show

522
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,540
are more like anxiety disorder.

523
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:02,430
I heard that your mother

524
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,030
doesn't allow you to study math.

525
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,010
But you like it a lot.

526
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:07,490
Yes.

527
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,090
I came originally to Germany

528
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,900
to study math.

529
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,210
But now I'm a patient.

530
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:19,240
Do you think your mother

531
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:19,990
is right?

532
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,140
I don't know.

533
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,740
Are you in pain?

534
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,420
Yes.

535
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,060
But you're afraid that she is correct,

536
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:31,760
right?

537
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:35,010
In fact, deep down in your heart,

538
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:35,820
you agree

539
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:37,110
with your mother.

540
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,800
You're afraid you'll become a psychotic

541
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,280
like your grandfather.

542
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,220
I think

543
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,050
fear is your biggest problem,

544
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,190
instead of math.

Mom,

546
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,610
I promised you

547
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,520
not to study math anymore.

548
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,980
But I broke my promise.

549
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:06,760

This

551

has brought

552
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,990
great pressure to me.

553
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,140
I don't know.

554
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,370

reading books related to math,

560
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,130
I had to cut

my inner thigh.

562

tell me before?

568
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:17,510
Because I think

this is my problem.

and received professional treatment.

00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,050
I've got rid of the symptoms.

575
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,660
But you still treat me

in order not to lose to you.

862
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,790
I didn't expect you to fall down.

863
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,790
Hello, Zhang Liang.

864
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:21,680
Pei Zhi.

865
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,300
Didn't you go to England

866
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,620
to learn hotel management?

867
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,160
Why did you go to Japan?

868
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:31,040
Life is hard.

869
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,060
The banquet ends at the end.

870
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,010
Speak in a way others can easily understand.

871
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,880
The hotel of my family was closed down.

872
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,570
So I didn't learn hotel management.

873
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,130
I passed the exam and went to Japan.

874
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,100
Did you study math?

875
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:47,780
Physics.

876
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,780
You finally got what you wanted.

877
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,300
Thanks for the collapse of my family business.

878
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,620
My parents couldn't control me anymore.

879
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:57,900
Now they allow me to

880
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,010
wherever I want to go.

881
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:02,140
It's a blessing in disguise.

882
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,170
You are really optimistic.

883
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,380
You're more optimistic than me,

884
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:09,140
staying in such a shabby place.

885
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,070
It seems like

886
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,910
you use your muscles much more than your brain.

887
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:15,570
Are your brain damaged

888
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,800
because you're too weak?

889
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,060
Why don't we play on the boxing stage?

890
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,580
I can give you an experience class.

891
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,180
So rude.

892
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:25,780
You embarrassed all the other straight A students

893
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:26,900
of the Experimental High School.

894
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,750
I don't want to associate with people like you.

895
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:32,140
All right. I'm relieved

896
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,130
since you're having a hard life. I'm leaving.

897
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,340
No need to see me off.

898
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,090
You don't have the right.

899
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:43,620
We are not

900
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:44,740
at the same level now.

901
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,660
I'm going to Yongchuan University next year.

902
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:50,820
Its math department is famous.

903
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:53,980
You know what I mean.
