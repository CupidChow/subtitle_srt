00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:13,940
Has he returned to China?

338
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,599
I don't know.

339
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,220
Don't you like him?

340
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,300
He went to Germany

341
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,619
without a word.

342
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:19,970
I couldn't contact him.

343
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:20,960
Why would I like him?

344
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,099
You were so eager

345
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,160
to go to Germany to meet him.

346
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,670
But I gave up.

347
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:25,810
I've grown up.

348
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,650
Nothing is difficult in the world

349
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,530
as long as you give it up.

350
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,420
Is this growth?

351
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,290
Growing up is about learning to compromise.

352
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,470
I immediately realized a problem.

353
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:33,980
You hadn't

354
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,100
experienced travel at that time.

355
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,390
You and I had never met.

356
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,470
A person's experience

357
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,770
determines who he or she is.

358
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,070
At that time,

359
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,750
you were still not

360
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,480
Lin Zhaoxi that I knew.

361
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,840
Is it more difficult than

362
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,240
solving the P=NP problem after we learned the Pythagoras Theorem?

363
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:46,740
That's enough, dad.

364
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:47,900
I've heard enough chicken soup for the soul.

365
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,220
My hiccups smell like the chicken soup.

366
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,510
I really don't want to hear it.

367
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,550
I remembered what you did

368
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:05,390
in your two travels.

369
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:08,140
You didn't change

370
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,360
the history of the Cheese World.

371
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,940
And you are a part of

372
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,390
of the Cheese World.

373
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,180
At this moment,

374
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,330
I also became a part of

375
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,770
of the Strawberry World.

376
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,820
I was making up for the past.

377
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,170
Who is it?

378
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,610
According to my plan

379
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,680
based on the temporal logic,

380
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,300
you would find

381
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,360
the photo

382
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,300
I put in the mailbox.

383
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,180
That was the opportunity to interfere with

384
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,570
what was happening in the two worlds.

385
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,770
It was also the key

386
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,650
to get to and from the Cheese World for the first time.

387

[Group 2: Pei Zhi, Lin Zhaoxi]

389
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,370

392
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,900
Why do you have this photo?

393
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,380
This is the photo

394
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,860
of the members of Zhang Shuping's training camp.

395
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,150
I even took part in it.

396
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,040
Where are you going?

397
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:22,460
Calm down.

398
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:24,080
Calm down.

399
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,460
Don't do this.

400
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,010
Calm down.

401
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,730
Don't touch me.

402
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,400
Even if I have travelled to the year of 2006,

403
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,140
I shouldn't be

404

at the welfare home.

405

I have my home.

406
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:55,700
I've grown up

407

with my dad.

408
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,640

412
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,730
What's the reason

413
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:06,980
caused all this?

414
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,400
The photo?

415
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,660
The formula? Or anything else?

416
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,710
Do you think we can go back?

417
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,180
In order not to affect

418
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,620
your second travel,

419

and hide my background,

421
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:22,780
I decided to carry out

422
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,040
one of my plans.

423
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,510
That was to hypnotize myself

424
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,100
and hide inside the body of Pei Zhi in the Strawberry World.

425

[Choose the target date]

[The countdown is 246 days]

430
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,900
I set a countdown

431
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,660
with the postgraduate entrance exam as the time point.

432
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,820
I hid the timing application

433
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,810
and waited for you to finish your two travels.

434
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:38,650
On the next evening,

435
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:39,770
Pei Zhi in the Strawberry World woke up.

436
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,020
Because

437
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,340
I controlled my body for a short time

438
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,220
and I did it after he fell asleep,

439

he didn't realize the problem.

440

He just found

441
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,260
there was a Newton's cradle

442
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,340
and a recording pen on the table.

443

It's September 25th.

457
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,300
Once upon a time,

458
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,060
there was a little fox.

459
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,860
She lived with her dad.

460
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,230
One day,

461
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,060
Mr. Fox was sick.

462
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,980
It was very serious.

463
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,780
At this moment,

464
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,010
the little fox suddenly travelled

465
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,440
to a parallel world.

466
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,700
In the parallel world,

467
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,430
she met

468
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,700
a healthy Mr. Fox.

469
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,870
After that,

470
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,170
the little fox found

471
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,560
she could choose

472
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,310
to travel back to her own world

473
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,440
and take care of her dad.

474
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,670
But she could also stay here

475
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,350
to live a easy life.

476
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,680
You...

477
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,770
What do you think the little fox would choose?

478
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:30,450
People have to face their difficulties.

479
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,520
[Girl, don't cry]

480
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,220
Do you think that parallel world

481
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:34,930
is somewhat let us escape from reality?

482
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,500
It doesn't matter if you succeed or not.

483
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,420
You just need to be healthy

484
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,840
and keep fighting.

485
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,310
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

486
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:44,890
Don't worry.

487
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,010
There's no pressure.

488
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,250
Can you describe

489
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,550
what happened just now.

490
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,170
I'm recording it.

491
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:56,940
Keep a file.

492
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,870
My daughter and I were on our way.

493
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,440
I heard...

494
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:08,620
He heard my dad's voice

495
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,940
from the recording pen.

496
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,210
So he put his attention

497
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,400
on the recording pen

498
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,180
and started the investigation.

499
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:15,670
Your father

500
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,740
died in 2009.

501
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,340
But the time of this recording

502
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,520
was February 22th, 2013.

503
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,040
So, the sound in the recording

504
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,270
is definitely not your father's.

505
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,720
But this is my father's voice.

506
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:25,940
You mean you know

507
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,960
who the other person was?

508
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,210
The master?

509
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,750
The car was too fast.

510
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,120
It rushed towards us.

511
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,840
My daughter and I were walking.

512
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,730
My daughter and I were walking.

513
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:39,570
Thank you, dad.

514
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:40,900
I wondered why the voices of the two people

515
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,480
sounded so familiar.

516
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:43,290
But when I was

517
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,080
in the Strawberry World,

518
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:44,990
I never thought it was my master

519
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,300
because they didn't know each other.

520
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,120
But now in the Cheese World,

521
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,510
they have known each other for a long time.

522
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,590
In 2013 of the Strawberry World,

523
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,410
my dad did have a car accident.

524
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,350
I don't remember the exact date.

525
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,380
But it should be

526
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,750
a few days after my birthday.

527
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,950
after my birthday.

528
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,670
The driver ran away.

529
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,300
Lin was fine,

530
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,700
so he didn't call the police.

531
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,350
But then he suffered the sequela.

532
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,520
So, I didn't remember

533
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,390
to connect the recording to this.

534
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,050
But now it seems

535
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:12,150
Lin in the Cheese World will suffer a car accident.

536
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,600
The recording shows that I can save him.

537
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,910
If I can save him,

538
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,610
he won't have

539
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,900
Alzheimer's disease.

540
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:22,610
Stop. Stop.

541
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,340
Eight months later,

542
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,040
the awakening condition I set triggered.

543
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,050
Stop.

544
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,020
Pei Zhi.

545
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:49,820
Pei Zhi in the Strawberry World.

546
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,660
Can you hear me?

547
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:52,980
Now I officially

548
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,250
introduce myself to you.

549
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,100
I'm Pei Zhi in the Cheese World.

550
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:01,820
Don't you want to

551
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,970
live with your dad?

552
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,110
I have a way

553
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,420
to get you to the Cheese World.

554
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,280
[All alarms are closed]

555
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,150
[The bell will ring in 9 minutes]

556
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,260
Pei Zhi in the Strawberry World.

557
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,910
Let's exchange our lives.

558
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,500
So,

559
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,690
you've been here

560
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:32,870
after the modeling competition.

561
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:33,940
Yes.

562
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,790
Although I stayed in his body

563
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,550
for half a year and knew everything,

564
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,290
I've never been to Germany.

565
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:46,440
After all,

566
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,640
we're two people from different worlds.

567
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,140
We have many differences.

568
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,950
Then why did you hide it from me?

569
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,420
Because he didn't agree.

570
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,300
Only if he voluntarily

571
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,280
wanted to,

572
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,870
he would be able to go to that world.

573
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,700
The reason why I didn't tell you

574
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,830
my real identity

575
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,380
was that I wanted to tell you it

576
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,420
after he left.

577
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,580
So, you wanted

578
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,680
to tell me it

579
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,460
after everything was settled.

580
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:15,150
Sorry, I...

581
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,530
I had to hide it.

582
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,190
You shouldn't be here. Do you know?

583
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,000
Since you were there

584
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,260
when I came to the Cheese World with him,

585
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,030
you should know

586
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,310
my choice.

587
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:26,180
I won't let you

588
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,140
stay here.

589
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:30,490
Of course I know.

590
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,740
Thus, I also come up with a way

591
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,010
to get you all to agree.

592
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,770
As long as you choose to let me stay here,

593
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,620
I'll complete

594
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,130
the proof that P=NP right away.

595
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,220
In the world of P=NP,

596
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,150
the medicine for Alzheimer's disease

597
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,710
will appear in advance.

598
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:55,420
This is the history

599
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,900
the Cheese World has been verified.

600
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,780
When I in this world

601
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,640
understand this,

602
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,470
he will agree to leave.

603
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,500
He hasn't appeared

604
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,840
to affect me during this period.

605
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,010
That's the best proof.

606
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,820
Don't you want to cure Lin?

607
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,230
If you miss

608
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,330
this opportunity,

609
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:17,860
Lin may not

610
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,170
be able to last long.

611
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:35,530
I...

612
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:37,670
I need you to tell me

613
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,560
your choice now.

614
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:41,460
If you choose him,

615
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,080
I won't leave

616
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,810
the arguments of P=NP for you.

617
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:47,660
I...

618
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,190
I don't know.

619
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,440
If you choose me,

620
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,550
I will always be with you.

621
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,480
I will be with you forever.

622
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,290
No. No. No.

623
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:01,890
I'm also Pei Zhi.

624
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,000
You don't understand. You're not the one

625
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,210
who grew up

626
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:04,860
and experienced

627
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,150
so many things with me.

628
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,780
What about Lin?

629
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,230
He only experienced half of his life.

630
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:10,920
He's still so young.

631
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,200
If he's not sick,

632
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,900
he must be passionate

633
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:14,930
about the life

634
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,040
and the math he loves.

635
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,340
Do you let him go?

636
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,360
I...

637
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:26,850
I...

638
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,670
Can you accept his leaving?

639
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,170
I can't.

640
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,490
But I...

641
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:38,700
Xi.

642
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:41,860
He and I

643
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,140
are watching you.

644
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,580
We're waiting for you to make a choice.

645
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,500
I want to save Lin.

646
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:16,570
But I... I have no choice.

647
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:19,970
I...

648
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,250
Sister.

649
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,280
Little Lin.

650
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,800
Dad said

651
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,650
he would row a boat one day

652
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,210
to a place very far away.

653
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,130
By then,

654
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,800
he can't take care of you anymore.

655
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,010
So, he created me.

656
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:46,690
Sing.

657
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,620
The bitter sand

658
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:50,950
blew on my face. It is painful.

659
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,700
It is like my father's scolding

660
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,780
and my mother's cry.

661
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,780
I can't forget it forever.

662
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,510
When I was young,

663
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,080
I liked to stay by the sea alone.

664
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,670
I rolled up my pants and my feet were bare.

665
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,140
I stepped on the beach.

666
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,130
Let me accompany my sister.

667
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,740
It's like our dad hasn't left.

668
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,660
I can talk with you,

669
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,870
tell jokes to you,

670
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,520
and sing for you.

671
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,080
Dad left a lot of words

672
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:20,470
and let me tell you.

673
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:23,880
In our lives,

674
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,940
we have a few opportunities to struggle.

675
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,240
[Starlight Sports Park]

676
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,620

846
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,170
He just forgot

847
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,080
the Lin Zhaoxi he knew

848
00:40:59,120 --> 00:40:59,990
was a person

849
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:02,700
who never gave up easily.

850
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,260
As long as she thinks it clearly,

851
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,760
she'll go in one direction.

852
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,940
No matter how hard the road will be,

853
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,060
she'll always go ahead.

854
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,320
This is the person he loves.

855
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,010
This may be

856
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:26,360
the only hope to cure Lin.

857
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:28,840
Don't you regret it?

858
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:35,400
♫Every day, every night, everything♫

859
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:32,940
Maybe...

860
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:35,900
Maybe we

861
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:37,580
♫It belongs to me♫

862
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:41,800
♫And it is anyone something just like me♫

863
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,140
can prove P=NP

864
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,500
together.

865
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:44,610
♫Just leave it together♫

866
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:47,460
♫Most thing will be ok♫

867
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,300
P=NP.

868
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:54,520
♫Something new, something hates, something change♫

869
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,620
Can we really make it?

870
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,940
Can't we?

871
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,120
♫It connected with me♫

872
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,030
♫And it is nothing makes me♫

873
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:58,660
There are two of us.

874
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:03,450
♫However nothing's gonna change♫

875
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,220
What you can do in the Cheese World,

876
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:05,940
we can do it too.

877
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:09,430
♫Yes, I will be ok♫

878
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,980
♫Take me back I used to be♫

879
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:14,300
Consistent Efforts.

880
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:20,080
♫I don't wanna be no one♫

881
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,420
A life that cannot be slackened.

882
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,350
♫Slowly sinking on my dream♫

883
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:22,940
The destination is right there.

884
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,090
♫There's one thing on my mind♫

885
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,140
♫Together♫

886
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,860
Let's walk over there.

887
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:33,960
♫Take me back I used to be♫

888
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:39,350
♫I wanna be the one♫

889
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:42,570
♫Take me in your mind with my time♫
