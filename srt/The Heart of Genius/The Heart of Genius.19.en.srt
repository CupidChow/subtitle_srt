No longer deal with any car accident.

00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,180
Whether that accident happens

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,180
or not,

the recording won't reappear.

8
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,300
My efforts become meaningless.

9
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,780
You're right.

10
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,680
Pei Zhi, you're handling it with a drastic measure.

11
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,560
Are you going to cut off

12
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,840
my way home?

13
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,400
I thought,

14
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,700
though I said we are enemies,

15
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,170
you may change your mind.

16
00:01:59,490 --> 00:01:59,940
Now I think

17
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,200
I was too stupid.

18
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,710
Do you remember Yu Minghai?

19
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,900
The owner of Minghai Boxing Club.

20
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:17,700
His father and my dad

21
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,540
are good friends.

22
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,340
But in Strawberry World,

23
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,060
his father died of liver cancer

24
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,180
in 2014.

25
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,620
It was only three months

26
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,920
from he noticed the cancer till he died.

27
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,490
But in Cheese World,

28
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:31,900
in this world,

29
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,160
under my supervision, Yu took his father to the hospital

30
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:37,180
for examination two days ago.

31
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,060
The early tumor is less than two centimeters.

32
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,079
The operation will be a success.

33
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:53,490
Don't you always suspect that

34
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,380
whether we can make the world

35
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,490
better?

36
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,300
I can tell you now

37
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,829
we will definitely make it.

38
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,660
Are you sure you want to give up

39
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,700
the chance to embrace

40
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,520
such a wonderful new world?

41
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,700
Yes, we can change

42
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,970
things here.

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,190
But I still have to go back.

44
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:11,820
I told you the reason.

45
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,630
Lin is also in this world.

46
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,340
That's different.

47
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,420
What's the difference?

48
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,420
Even if I leave,

49
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,180
the Lin Zhaoxi from Cheese World

50
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,220
will accompany the Lin from Cheese World.

51
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,700
But for Lin in Strawberry World,

52
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,660
he only has me.

53
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,110
It's okay.

54
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,720
It's okay to be eliminated.

55
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,350
There are winners and losers in competitions.

56
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,240
It's good to enter the second round.

57
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,200
It's meaningless.

58
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,380
I couldn't enter the finals.

59
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,790
You have to be confident, you know?

60
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,020
With all your efforts...

61
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,440
What's the latter part?

62
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,120
Never slack in your life.

63
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:00,980
Your sister knows.

64
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:01,970
Never slack in your life.

65
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,820
You have to work hard and have confidence.

66

00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,440
Why are you so upset?

69
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,350
I'm in a bad mood.

Do you know Jin Yong?

71

In his life,

72

he wrote 14 books.

73
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,390
The titles of his books be connected into a couplet.

can also be combined into a sentence?

Isn't it funny?

85

You can't handle setbacks.

86
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,870
Stand up.

Pei Zhi didn't come to class.

He asked for leave.

95

He said the company is preparing some equipment.

96

Sir, I want to ask for leave too.

For what?

98

You set up a company too?

Why are you talking so loudly?

103
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,460
Look how energetic you are

104
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,590
and how loudly you speak.

105

It's not like you have a stomachache.

Go back. Stop it.

107

Go back.

108
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,170
Drink some warm water.

109
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,010
Don't drink cold water.

I've asked for leave from the class teacher.

I'll go home now.

Lin Zhaoxi skipped class.

Did you see her go out?

126
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,090
I opened the door for her.

127
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,900
Why didn't you stop her?

128

She went to find Pei Zhi.

129

I think she was serious

130

so I let her go.

131

Mr Lin, you're too generous.

Don't you have any vigilance?

They are going to college.

I don't care.

They're in the senior year,

I prevented her form puppy love.

Mr. Lin, you are...

143

So carefree, right?

144
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,409
Fine, my worries are unnecessary.

145
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:44,860
I will leave her alone.

146

My surname is Xie,

147
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,020
not Jie.

148
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,510
Boss should show his confidence

149
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,100
in front of employees.

150
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,840
Employees can complain about

their tiring work and uncertainty about future,

152

about the company's future.

154
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,350
But the boss can't.

155
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,600
The boss must be confident.

156
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,180
Otherwise, if the boss is depressed all day,

157
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,100
half of the employees

158

00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,190
Hello.

160

May I ask if Pei Zhi is here?

What?

Pei Zhi.

163
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,060
Ask him.

164
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,090
Okay, thank you.

165
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:33,710
Shout out!

Yes.

174
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,830
He's in the computer room downstairs.

175
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,650
Just go find him.

176
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,510
Okay, I'm leaving.

177
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,520
Actually, I can be here for you.

178
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,290
Me?

179
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,740
Yes, is it convenient for you?

180
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,120
I have a few questions.

181
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,550
Well, let's sit down and talk.

182
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,560
Okay, thank you.

183
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,020
So you resigned

184
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,560
to help Pei Zhi set up the company?

185
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,180
Yes.

186
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,680
Don't you feel regretful?

187
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,340
You gave up a chance

188
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,080
to serve the people.

189
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,970
Well, I do.

190
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,150
But I am just

191
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,200
a normal person.

192
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,110
I have to consider my own life.

193
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,860
It's our family business.

194
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,020
Someone should help with the management.

195
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,500
Pei Zhi's mother

196
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,700
is in poor health.

197
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:38,820
Here's my consideration.

198
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,560
When Pei Zhi finishes his college entrance exam,

199
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,280
and he has time

200
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,170
to manage the company,

201
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,400
I'll think about

202
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,020
going back to the traffic police force.

203
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,740
It'll be too late.

204
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:49,900
What?

205
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,060
Lin Zhaoxi?

206
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,210
She's here for you.

207
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,230
Come with me.

208
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:56,780
It's okay.

209
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,280
I haven't finished talking with him.

210
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:58,850
Come out.

211
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,180
What?

212
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,580
Come out.

213
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,190
These two kids.

214
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,340
What? You want to fight?

215
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,910
I don't want to fight with you.

216
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,240
You want to go back to Strawberry World

217
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,690
and take care of Lin who's sick.

218
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,010
I want to stay in this world

219
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,850
with my dad

220
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,950
and live a happy life.

221
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:39,660
Our demands

222
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,820
can't be satisfied at the same time.

223
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,620
So one must

224
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,700
give up voluntarily.

225
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,300
Yes, I understand that

226
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,770
you want a complete family.

227
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:47,900
But I can't

228
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,890
give up.

229
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,140
I can't give up either.

230
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,820
I just want you to

231
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:54,850
stay in this world with me.

232
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,620
Is that OK?

233
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,580
Okay, I got it.

234
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,240
I won't blame you anymore.

235
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,520
I hope you won't blame me.

236
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,780
Let's do it our way.

237
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,800
Why are you back?

238
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,260
You skipped class.

239
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,650
Then I can skip work.

240
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,840
Why are you back at this hour?

241
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:49,960
I don't know.

242
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,500
Everything is meaningless.

243
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,530
Then just do nothing.

244
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,330
If you don't know what to do,

245
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,310
just think about the present.

246
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,900
If you can't figure it out, look at the future.

247
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,330
Take your time.

248
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,180
You'll figure it out sooner or later.

I tried my best to laugh, dad.

255
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,970
I really can't.

256
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:21,970
My joke is a bit out-of-date.

257
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,740
No, it's my problem.

258

Here's a gift for you.

259
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,730
I heard that

260
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,330
you showed your gene of talent recently.

But you gave me calculus.

It's really Lin's style.

Do you know

why I like math?

00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,800
It's done, dad.

345
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,420
Come on.

346
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,710
Come on.

347
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,060
Give my sister some.

348
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,910
It's ok.

349
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,340
Here, sister.

350
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,260
Who wants this?

351
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,670
Hua Juan.

352
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,580
What are you doing this weekend?

353
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,340
Are you free?

354
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,270
What?

355
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,060
Do me a favor.

356
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,340
Can you

357
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,330
ask Pei Zhi out?

358
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,180
Why don't you ask him out?

359
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,890
Did you two have a fight?

360
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:28,860
No.

361
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,590
Someone is bullying your sister.

362
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,640
Will you help me?

363
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,300
Did he bully you?

364
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:33,830
No.

365
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,990
I'll find him tomorrow.

366
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,090
Don't do anything stupid.

367
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:37,940
That's not what I mean.

368
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:38,670
I mean,

369
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,340
can you

370
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:40,960
ask Pei Zhi out

371
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,060
and go watch

372
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,930
a movie

373
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,520
or have a meal with him?

374
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,270
Anyway, don't let him go home.

375
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,790
We go watch a movie and have dinner?

376
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,260
It's just a metaphor.

377
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,080
You can do something else.

378
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,860
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

379
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,360
I could ask him to go to the Internet cafe.

380
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,300
Movies and dinners

381
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,130
are so troublesome.

382
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,110
Fine.

383
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,900
Ask him to go to the Internet cafe.

384
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,660
It's a deal.

385
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,340
Sister.

386
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,720
What are you going to do?

387
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,620
Don't worry.

388
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,110
Listen.

389
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,140
It's no good to know too much.

390
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,350
Don't forget.

391
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,220
What?

392
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,820
So mysterious.

393
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,900
When your dad was a traffic police,

394
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,350
he could have a day off.

395
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,660
Why is he so busy

396
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,780
even on weekends now?

397
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,740
Maybe it's because the company is just set up.

398
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:39,910
He has a lot to do.

399
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,410
Your dad has been a bit arrogant recently.

400
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,680
He asked me to call him Mr. Pei.

401
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,060
Let me tell you, I should be

402
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,430
the general manager.

403
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,490
Let him be the vice president

404
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,500
and work for me.

405
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:54,800
Sure, Mum.

406
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,770
How about you manage the company

407
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,010
and let my dad do the housework?

408
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,460
Forget it.

409
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,780
Considering your dad's cooking skills,

410
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:05,980
for my son's health,

411
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,869
I can't let him

412
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,280
enter the kitchen.

413
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,290
Hello, Hua Juan.

414
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,359
Pei Zhi, let's hang out.

415
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:19,650
There is a newly opened Internet cafe nearby.

416
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,920
Let's play games.

417
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,339
I want to stay home with my mom today.

418
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,260
I won't hang out.

419
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,839
Come out with me for a while.

420
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,180
The latest League of Legends

421
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,930
is fun.

422
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,120
Come play with me.

423
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,760
I've played that game.

424
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,020
Sorry.

425
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,420
I really don't want to hang out today.

426
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:33,900
Next time.

427
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:36,820
You've changed.

428
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,100
You've changed.

429
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,020
Pei Zhi, you've changed.

430
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,850
You weren't like this before.

431
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:43,980
It's been a long time

432
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,430
since we hung out.

433
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,290
I was eliminated.

434
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,760
I was so depressed.

435
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,180
You're even unwilling

436
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:52,890
to play games with me.

437
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,020
Are we still friends?

438
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,630
I...

439
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,660
Go. You don't have to accompany me.

440
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,410
You don't have to accompany me. Go.

441
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:02,700
Okay.

442
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,080
Fine.

Let's make a deal.

I'll use AP Electrodeless Juggernaut on MID.

445

You're good with AD.

I'm good at using Galen to support you.

It doesn't matter.

00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,380
Fine, you'll work on MID and I work on Jungle.

449
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,140
I'll support you.

Bye.

Okay, I'll come down now.

454

When will you come back?

455
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,360
I'll be back before dinner.

Then you can't eat the ribs.

458
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,180
Mom, save some for me

459

as dinner.

00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,000

00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:56,300
Let's go.

687
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,070
Mom, I'm back.

688
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:04,960
You're back?

689
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,980
Lin Zhaoxi came to you just now.

690
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,290
Lin Zhaoxi?

691
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:15,170
She said she called you.

692
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,240
She waited

693
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:16,760
in your room,

694
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,750
and left after a while.

695
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,820
She said she couldn't figure out a few questions.

696
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,820
She wants to ask you.

697
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,380
I don't think

698
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,260
she came to ask questions.

699
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,100
She seemed to have something else.

700
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,180
Probably some questions

701
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,380
about programming.

702
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,410
She's so poor at studying.

703
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,490
She doesn't have time to learn programming.

704
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,390
No.

705
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,260
She made

706
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:39,870
great progress.

707
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,370
She can be in the top 20 in our grade.

708
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,720
Wasn't she in the last place last semester?

709
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,760
Maybe she's been working hard recently.

710
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,340
Mom, I need to use the computer.

711
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,710
Is Lin that amazing?

712
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,280
Have some tangerines.

713
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:16,760
No, mom.

714
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,140
I'll cook dinner for you.

715
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,320
[Change user's name]

716
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,020
I save the ribs for lunch.

717
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,740
Sister, how did it go?

718
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,290
It's done. You did a good job.

719
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,480
[Protect Artifacts]

720
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:40,740
Sister.

721
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,010
Do you know how exciting it was today?

722
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,100
I wanted to

723
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,140
take Pei Zhi to the Internet cafe.

724
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,700
But the Internet cafe didn't let us in.

725
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,110
Guess where did we go.

726
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:47,650
Where?

727
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,060
Do you know how embarrasing it is

728
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,340
that two men watch movie together

729
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,870
in the cinema?

730
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:54,460
Others are all couples.

731
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,900
What are you doing?

732
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,740
I told you not to ask.

733
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,220
I'm curious.

734
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,810
What happened between you and Pei Zhi?

735
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,070
You asked me to distract him.

736
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,370
Why did you go to his house?

737
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,370
I was in it.

738
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:15,790
Just tell me.

739
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,390
I'm having a hard time.

740
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,100
I want his company to go bankrupt.

741
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,500
Sister, are you serious?

742
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,270
That's Pei Zhi.

743
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,110
We grew up together.

744
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,180
Why do you

745
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,360
want to do that to him?

746
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,520
I can't tell anyone

747
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,300
the things between Pei Zhi and me.

748
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,140
I know.

749
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,980
You're too tired to love.

750
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,030
Hua Juan, let me tell you.

751
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,780
It's better for you to read more books

752
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:42,850
than surfing the Internet.

753
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,360
Look, sister.

754
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,460
Now you're

755
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,450
lecturing me again.

756
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,860
Since your grades

757
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,050
improved greatly,

758
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:50,740
you've changed

759
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,970
a lot.

760
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,380
I miss

761
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,110
the Lin Zhaoxi

762
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,020
who struggles on study with me.

763
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:05,300
Tell me, who are you?

764
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,150
Why did you

765
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:07,940
become my sister?

766
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,860
Give me back my sister.

767
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,090
What are you writing?

768
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,960
The company is recruiting.

769
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,340
I want to know how many people

770
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,810
do we need in every post.

771
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,920
They work on computers now.

772
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,780
Who would write like you?

773
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,490
I'm not used to using computers.

774
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:59,240
You're really into the role as a boss.

775
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:01,680
What do you mean?

776
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,010
I'm not a fake boss.

777
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:03,690
At least,

778
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,760
I'm in charge of dozens of people.

779
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:05,870
You think I'm kidding?

780
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:06,710
You said

781
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,240
you don't want to do it.

782
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,660
Now you're exposed.

783
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,260
You're obsessed with power.

784
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,780
I just want to manage the company

785
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:15,120
for my son.

786
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,100
When he takes over,

787
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,030
it can't be a mess.

788
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,120
Have you noticed

789
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,830
something is wrong with Pei Zhi recently?

790
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,340
What's wrong?

791
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,070
In the past,

792
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,520
he

793
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,260
kept talking

794
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,290
about the school

795
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,100
or taught us a lesson.

796
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,180
But he's

797
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,690
not talking now.

798
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,620
He has changed recently.

799
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,580
I feel it too.

800
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,030
Do you think he broke up?

801
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,610
He has never been in a relationship.

802
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:54,870
How could he break up?

803
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,220
Do you know that?

804
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:56,970
Of course.

805
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,550
My son tells me everything.

806
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,130
Where did you get the confidence?

807
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:00,780
When you were young,

808
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,900
you told your dad everything?

809
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,960
Of course, I didn't.

810
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,820
But you can't make a wild guess.

811
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,700
I have evidence.

812
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:11,970
Lin Zhaoxi came to our house today.

813
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,440
Son was not home.

814
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,660
The girl waited in his room

815
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,830
and left after a while.

816
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,020
After Pei Zhi heard it,

817
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,360
he didn't look good immediately.

818
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,820
Then he went out.

819
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,310
Do you think

820
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,550
something happened between them?

821
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,500
Lin Zhaoxi had a fight with Pei Zhi?

822
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,260
No way.

823
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:29,040
Even though they had a fight,

824
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,840
it's Lin Zhaoxi who apologizes.

825
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,900
It's hard to say.

826
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,500
Pei Zhi has been pursuing Lin Zhaoxi

827
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,310
for so many years.

828
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,850
You know that.

829
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:40,450
Pei Zhi

830
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:41,740
is so busy every day.

831
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,640
There are so many things to do in the company and school.

832
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,530
As long as our son is successful in the future,

833
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,100
girls will pursue him.

834
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:49,350
Just like how you pursued me.

835
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,800
Say it again.

836
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,090
Who pursued who?

837
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:55,370
I pursued you. I pursued you.

838
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,380
I was wrong.

839
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,440
Pei Donglai, I think

840
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,100
you've been a little arrogant lately.

841
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:00,900
Do you feel proud

842
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,260
after being a boss?

843
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,260
Do you want me get you

844
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,190
a young girl

845
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,250
as your secretary

846
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:05,860
to show

847
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,500
the charm of a middle-aged man?

848
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,070
Okay.

849
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:09,580
You...

850
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:13,700
No, no, no.

851
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,650
My ideal salary is 8,000 yuan.

852
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,340
You just graduated from university.

853
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,490
You didn't graduate from a famous university,

854
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,780
and you're not a skilled worker.

855
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,390
How dare you ask for

856
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,900
such a high salary?

857
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,900
I'm good at communicating.

858
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:37,740
In college,

859
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,940
I was the president of the Department of Public Relations.

860
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,180
I can coordinate the team well.

861
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,170
Please stop the recruitment.

862
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,550
Mr. Pei, prepare the meeting room.

863
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,750
We need to talk.

864
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:53,940
Alright,

865
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:54,850
let's look at the second question.

866
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,020
If A, B, and C are all gas,

867
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,500
the reaction will be balanced

868
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,900
in ten minutes.

869
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,180
Here comes the first question.

870
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,940
[Call from dad]

871
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:02,890
How many times the pressure is

872
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,330
compared with the pressure at the beginning?

873
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,470
Does anyone know?

874
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,070
Three times.

875
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,270
Three times?

876
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:11,010
[Call from dad]

877
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,020
How do we calculate

878
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:10,980
the pressure?

879
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,850
Remember this.

880
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:12,860
The pressure

881
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,210
equals the quantity relative ratio of material.

882
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:14,540
[Call from dad]

883
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,179
How much is the quantity relative ratio?

884
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,429
Let's look at this picture.

885
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:18,239
Sir.

886
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,409
What's wrong, Pei Zhi?

887
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:20,770
I need to go to the bathroom.

888
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:21,980
Go ahead.

889
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:22,770
Thank you.

890
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:23,750
Look at this picture.

891
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,980
A plus B plus C.

892
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:29,480
[Attitude decides everything, details determine success or failure.]

893
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,659
What's the initial quantity relative ratio?

894
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:29,780
A is three mol.

895
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:31,710
B, one mol.

896
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,780
C is also three mol.

897
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,060
So it's seven mol in total.

898
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:34,630
Right?

899
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,389
Okay, what's the end?

900
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:36,940
Nine times.

901
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:37,739
Nine times.

902
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,020
Nine sevenths times.

903
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,389
Hello, dad.

904
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,060
Don't worry. Take your time.

905
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:52,520
Don't worry.

906
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,270
We're not making Role Play Games.

907
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:56,100
No one wants to make personal servers.

908
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,330
The regedit can be easily blocked.

909
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,550
Even if the source code is leaked,

910
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:03,710
it won't affect us much.

911
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:06,850
By the way, dad,

912
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,140
is Charlie still here?

913
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:10,790
Tell him to wait for me.

914
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,210
I'll be right there.

915
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:13,540
Okay, bye.

916
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:27,220
The outstanding point of our game

917
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,530
is creativity.

918
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,780
But creativity is the most valuable

919
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:30,930
and the least valuable thing.

920
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,190
Several big companies

921
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,500
are

922
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:34,540
developing new

923
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,620
Auto Chess Battle.

924
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,260
They plagiarized your idea,

925
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:38,620
made some adjustments,

926
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,620
and bundled sales with the copyright of the hot game.

927
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,040
Their productions are better than yours,

928
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,140
and they operate better than you.

929
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,710
I wonder

930
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,020
how are we going to compete with them?

931
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:46,900
What you said

932
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,650
has nothing to do

933
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,800
with the leak of source code.

934
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,140
The only advantage we have now

935
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,230
is time.

936
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,970
The leak of the source code

937
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,410
will only make

938
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,050
our advantage more useless.

939
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,140
And Steak Company

940
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,620
has a reason to suspect you

941
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,580
and your father's management ability.

942
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:03,370
Enough.

943
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,610
Stop beating around the bush.

944
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:06,660
Just say it.

945
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:07,420
What do you want?

946
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,170
Sell all your shares to us.

947
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,060
That means

948
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,320
you sell the copyright

949
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,180
of Auto Chess Battle.

950
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,660
Mr. Pei, have some water.

951
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,210
This is my company.

952
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,970
I can get some myself.

953
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,900
Honey, you're here.

954
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,550
What happened?

955
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,220
They said

956
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,980
the source code of the game.

957
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,180
was leaked

958
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,510
on the Internet.

959
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,900
I don't understand too much.

960
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:39,590
Where is Pei Zhi?

961
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,700
They're negotiating.

962
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,860
Don't be too anxious.

963
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,700
I'm not anxious.

964
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,780
I'm afraid son will be anxious.

965
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,380
I'll go back

966
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,220
to prepare the contract.

967
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:58,740
Okay.

968
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,180
I hope

969
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,340
we can work together again.

970
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,210
See you.

971
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,300
Son, how is it?

972
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,910
We were kicked out.

973
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,720
Is it that serious?

974
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,730
It's not a bad thing.

975
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,380
It's just that my dad

976
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,310
can't be the boss anymore.

977
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,070
That's not a big deal.

978
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,660
I'm just worried about you.

979
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,930
Son, don't be discouraged.

980
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:41,410
If your heart is there, your dream is there.

981
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,340
We can start over.

982
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,070
Dad, Mom.

983
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:47,860
Don't worry.

984
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:48,940
I'm really fine.

985
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,220
And they plan to

986
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:52,740
pay 8 million

987
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,540
to buy our game.

988
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,060
We're rich now.

989
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,190
Don't you always

990
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,460
want to change our house?

991
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:00,670
If you're free these days,

992
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,820
you can seek for a house.

993
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:03,450
By the way,

994
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:04,740
I have to go back to school.

995
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:05,660
I didn't ask for leave

996
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,140
when I came out this afternoon.

997
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,540
How will you go back?

998
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,870
I'll just take a taxi.

999
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,060
Be careful.

1000
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:11,890
Okay.

1001
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:13,740
I'm leaving, dad.

1002
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:14,940
Then you...

1003
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,660
I think our son is quite shocked.

1004
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,100
All of a sudden,

1005
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,750
the source code

1006
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,620
was lost?

1007
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,500
Why didn't you hide it and keep it?

1008
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,750
That's a program.

1009
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,430
It's in Pei Zhi's computer.

1010
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,980
How can I hide it?

1011
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,810
Pei Zhi's computer?

1012
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,620
Wait.

1013
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,950
What are you watching?

1014
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,650
A movie poster.

1015
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,330
When it's on show,

1016
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:53,870
you can ask Pei Zhi to take you to the cinema.

1017
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,250
Yesterday,

1018
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:56,820
Lin Zhaoxi came to our house.

1019
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:57,260
She said she wanted

1020
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,820
to use Pei Zhi's computer to surf the Internet.

1021
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,410
Do you think it's her?

1022
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,700
No.

1023
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,420
Don't doubt her. She's just a kid.

1024
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,430
I think

1025
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,060
it must be done by hackers.

1026
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,060
It's so popular that someone may envy.

You did it?

Ji Jiang was also arranged by you?

1029
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,700
Didn't I said we'll do it on our own?

1030
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,640
It seems to be effective.

1031
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,500
It's very good.

1032

They took over my company.

he will return to the traffic police force.

In this way,

even if I set up another company,

1038

he won't quit.

1039
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,120
Sorry.

1040
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,350
I ruined your work.

1041
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,260
Not really.

1042
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,270
I just plagiarized

1043
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,540
the idea of Strawberry World.

1044
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,300
You don't need to apologize.

1045
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,590
Because what you did

1046

is to complete one thing.

1049

And I just need to destroy it.

1050
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,500
Destroying is always

1051
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,220
easier than building.

1052
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,790
I asked my dad to leave the traffic police force

1053

just to tell you

1054
