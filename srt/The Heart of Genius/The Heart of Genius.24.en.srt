But my dad remembers everything.

And he looks good

693
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,790
recently.

694
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,270
A temporary sober mind

695
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:52,000
doesn't mean he has been cured.

696
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,120
Look, we can

697
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,150
see the neuritic plaques.

698
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,340

The related pathology

of Alzheimer's disease

701
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,230
has appeared.

702

Lin has been sick for five years.

You should know

704
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:10,199
the patients' median survival time

705
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:12,320
is 7.21 years.

706
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,139
What does it mean?

707
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,500
Only two years left.

708
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,100
Not exactly.

709
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:24,300
There are individual differences.

710
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,639
Besides, dementia

711
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:27,540
is not the direct

712
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:28,690
or potential cause of death.

713
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,130
You should be more vigilant

714
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,639
about complications and comorbidities

715
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:35,420

OK.

717
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,710
I'm fine.

719
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:43,260
you said it in a serious way.

720
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,179
Do you remember?

721
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,380
You told me

722
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:47,440
that at my age,

723
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,710
the odds of getting it

724
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:49,940
is 4 in 10,000.

725
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,219
That means

726
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,380
there's a chance of 4 in 10,000

727

that I can live to 90.

Yes.

Keep optimistic. Live healthily.

730
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,790
Exercise regularly.

731

There's hope for everything.

OK. Thank you.

Don't listen to Dr. Ma.

I know my health.

Much more than 80.

745

You have to look at this problem

00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,820
in the light of development.

747
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,500

the disease will be solved.

Right? Just take some medicine.

But seriously,

752
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,880
you have to pay attention to it.

I do.

He threw the chicken into the river.

"I'm taking care of its clothes."

a human-eating tribe.

"Hit them 40 times each."

826
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,090
Henry told the chief,

827
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,900
"I need a cushion."

828
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,440
The chief said, "OK."

After that,

"I want 10 cushions."

834
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,250
The chief agreed again.

835

After that, Yamamoto was fine.

836
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,940
Then he started to show off

837

in front of Henry.

838
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:03,000
Finally, it was my son.

839
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,780
The chief asked,

840
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,190
"How many cushions do you want?"

841
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:12,010
My son said, "I don't want a cushion."

842
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,500
"I want Yamamoto."

843
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,140
Who are you?

844
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,420

The police came and said, "You stole the chicken."

851

The thief was nervous.

852
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:49,500
He threw the chicken into the river.

853
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,460
He said no.

854

Henry, Bond, Yamamoto,

862
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:26,840
were practicing shooting.

863
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,070
They put an apple

864
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:31,440
on the head of Yamamoto.

865
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,620
Henry took 10 steps away and turned around.

866
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:39,100
He broke the apple with one shot.

867
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,420
Then he blew the muzzle and said,

868
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,550
"I'm Henry."

869
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,460
Another new apple.

870
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,620
Bond took 20 steps away,

871
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:53,220
He turned around

872
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,580
and shot the apple.

873
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,100
Then he blew the muzzle and said,

874
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,540
"I'm Bond."

875
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,100
Finally, my son.

876
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,580
He put an apple

877
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,990
on the head of Yamamoto.

878
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,380
He took 5 steps away.

879
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,650
Turned around.

880
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,460
And shot.

881
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,660
He killed Yamamoto.

882
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:18,310
Then he blew the muzzle and said,

883
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:20,400
"I'm sorry."

884
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,900
I'm sorry.

885
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,320
How long has Grandpa Gong been sick?

886
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,690
It's been ten years.

887
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,970
He likes to hear jokes.

888
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,020
When he was selling fried dough sticks,

889
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:46,040
if you told him a joke,

890
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,560
he would give you a few more.

891
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,330
I saw when you told jokes,

892
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,840
he was smiling happily.

893
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,140
But you two

894
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,950
kept repeating it.

895
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:57,920
It's quite painful.

896
00:41:58,650 --> 00:41:59,580
Painful?

897
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,840
You have to think of it in another way.

898
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:06,240
He doesn't have a clear mind

899
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,320
and listens to the same joke now.

900
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,650
But he's quite happy.

901
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,050
Most people

902
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:13,010
have clear minds in life.

903
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,610
I don't think

904
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,500
they are happier than him.

905
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:19,820
Well...

906
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,700
Anything in this world

907
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,700
could happen

908
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,580
on anyone.

909
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,120
It's no big deal.

910
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,910
It's no big deal?

911
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:30,870
It's no big deal.

Xiaomeng?

920
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:56,280
Uncle Lin, I'm here to visit you.

921
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,070
I brought you some fresh white fungus.

922
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,060
Don't bring anything. Come in.

923
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:02,240
Xi, Xiaomeng is here.
