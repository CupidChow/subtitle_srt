4
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:39,570
Are you willing to join me?

5
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,660
Yes.

6
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,509
Me too.

7
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:42,140
Yes.

8
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,330
Xi, thank you for counting me in.

9
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:45,420
When we were in the Youth Palace...

10
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,500
We are classmates. Don't mention it.

11
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,870
I can't let you off so easily.

12
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:50,590
I saw you

13
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,479
bring some snack.

14
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,670
Chocolate, made in Switzerland.

15
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:53,370
Give it to me.

16
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,350
Let me explain my plan.

17
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,240
There are ten people here.

18
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,740
I think we should divide us into two teams.

19
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,960
I'll be one of the team leaders.

20
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,270
My team members are Lu Zhihao,

21
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,590
Yu Tianjiao, Yao Xiaotian,

22
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,700
and Shao Mingchen.

23
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,800
The rest are another team.

24
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,340
Your team leader is Pei Zhi.

25
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,290
I'll team up with Hua Juan.

26
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,740
You are not with us.

27
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,570
The competition is about the average scores of teams.

28
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,240
Pei Zhi and I

29
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,200
are more confident of getting a high score.

30
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,920
But if you

31
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,900
work harder,

32
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:33,980
I believe

33
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,000
the average scores of both teams

34
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,700
won't rank the last three.

35
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,480
But it's very risky.

36
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,829
If you team up with Pei Zhi,

37
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,460
the average score won't be low.

38
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,000
But if you break up...

39
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,100
You can't think like that.

40
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,579
Don't forget

41
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,590
our goal

42
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,740
is to let everyone here

43
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,740
get a high score.

44
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,200
Everyone of you.

45
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:52,970
Got it.

46
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,110
Any other questions?

47
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:57,230
Just say it.

48
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,520
Why are you helping us?

49
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,320
We are

50
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,270
the worst in the training camp.

51
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,540
Yes, and we don't know each other.

52
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:06,790
Just take it as

53
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,740
my dislike of Zhang Shuping.

54
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,780
I want to go against his rules.

55
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,100
And I don't think

56
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,270
you are the worst

57
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,060
in the training camp.

58
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,130
You just failed in one exam.

59
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,460
It's nothing.

60
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,040
But I don't want to hold you back.

61
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,640
I used to think

62
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,620
I was good at studying in the class.

63
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,420
But when I came here,

64
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:24,970
I found I'm a loser.

65
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,300
Forget it.

66
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,850
You should form an elite team.

67
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,780
In that way, you can compete with Zhang Liang's team.

68
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,480
With us,

69
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,510
I'm afraid you'll fail.

70
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,640
Don't be discouraged.

71
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,360
We'll make it if we work hard.

72
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,170
I'm still not confident.

73
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,700
Have you all read Harry Potter?

74
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:48,990
Don't you think

75
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,660
we are similar to the characters in the book?

76
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,400
Zhang Liang is the Marlford

77
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,290
in Slytherin,

78
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,990
showing off everyday

79
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,780
with his followers.

80
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,829
Zhang Shuping is

81
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,790
the Professor Snape

82
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,690
who doesn't like us.

83
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,640
And we

84
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,850
are a group of brave and lively people

85
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,640
who help each other

86
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,060
in Gryffindor.

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,440
Well. We do look like them.

88
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,300
Right?

89
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,940
What's the tradition of Gryffindor?

90
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,770
It's courage and adventure.

91
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,690
What are you afraid of? Just study hard.

92
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,790
No one is worse.

93
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,130
We all have brains.

94
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,420
Can we get two more taels

95
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,339
from Zhang Liang's brain?

96
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:17,730
Hua Juan is right.

97
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,350
We have to be brave.

98
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,860
We need to

99
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,610
overcome the difficulties bravely like Gryffindor.

100
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,770
Let's work hard together.

101
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:27,860
Come on!

102
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,320
Come on!

103
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:55,830
This is the teaming decision

104
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,900
you made.

105
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,700
You have to be responsible for your choice.

106
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:01,740
Good luck.

107
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,700
Everyone, attention!

108
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,180
Turn left.

109
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,230
The first two rows, follow me.

110
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,020
The back three, follow up.

111
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,800
So big.

112
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,640
So many.

113
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,610
So many books.

114
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,760
That's too many

115
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,150
The library in the Oasis Camp

116
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,140
owns a large collection of books.

117
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,500
But you just need to

118
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,340
focus on this bookshelf.

119
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,860
There are six floors in total.

120
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:42,780
It contains books collected from

121
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,020
the city library

122
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,740
and various school libraries

123
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,120
and some books

124
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:48,860
I collected myself.

125
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,290
This bookshelf

126
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,030
covers the scope of examination

127
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,080
in the training camp this month.

128
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,290
That's a lot.

129
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,220
The internal teaching materials

130
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,380
I sent you before

131
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:01,900
can be regarded as

132
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,410
the reading guide of this bookshelf.

133
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,100
I only learn one book

134
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,020
in a semester in school.

135
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,480
How can I learn that many in a month?

136
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,860
That's too many for me.

137
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,180
That's right. That's too many.

138
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,040
How can we learn them all?

139
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:16,850
Sir,

140
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,370
I still don't know how to learn.

141
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,740
Yeah, how?

142
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,940
How?

143
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,610
Pei Zhi,

144
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,490
how will you learn?

145
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,010
Teachers arranged

146
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,050
these books logically.

147
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,710
For example, "counting",

148
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,860
"chart filling", and "dismantling numbers" for the first grade,

149
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:45,960
"recognizing

150
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,940
simple sequence" and

151
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,490
"funny natural sequence questions" for the second and third grades,

152
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:49,830
and then "finding rules from numerical tables"

153
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,540
for the fourth and fifth grades.

154
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:53,390
These books are all about numbers.

155
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,020
After reading these books,

156
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,500
we could figure out the points,

157
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:57,750
summary,

158
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,490
and arrange them orderly in the brain.

159
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,600
I think that's all.

160
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,070
Build a math knowledge system yourself

161
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,620
to learn about unfamiliar contents.

162
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,260
Take exams

163
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,860
to find out your weaknesses.

164
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,190
Then take classes with your questions

165
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,900
and ask teachers for answers.

166
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,590
This is the learning method

167
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,580
you should master.

168
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:21,890
That's it.

169
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:22,940
Pei Zhi,

170
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,650
a good answer.

171
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,300
Thank you, sir.

172
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,140
Gryffindor gets ten more points.

173
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,900
What's Gryffindor?

In the next few days,

176
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,500
you'll primarily work on self-study.

177
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,780

178
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,140
teachers' lectures

179
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:46,940
will be very short.

180
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,240
In the rest of the time,

181
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,710
teachers will answer your questions.

or extra activities,

184
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,120
you can stay in the library,

185

in the camp

188
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,620
and self-study in groups.

189
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,510

193
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,830
You can study

194
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,310
according to the outline.

195
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,480
We don't have much time.

196
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,510
It's impossible

197
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,700
to read every book in detail.

198
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,820
We must get to the points.

199
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:12,660
If you don't understand,

200
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:13,840
you can ask me or Pei Zhi anytime.

201
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:14,570
Thank you.

202
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,830
We are friends.

203
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,540
You're welcome.

204
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,060
Remember the following three points.

205
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,020
First,

206
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,980
you must return the documents

207
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:21,940
to the library on time.

208
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,540
Excuse me.

209
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,080
Second, be careful.

210
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,380
You must go back to the dormitory

211
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,520
before 8 p.m.

212
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,470
Third, don't stay up late.

213
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,669
You can't study all night.

214
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,539
The dorm will turn off the lights

215
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,250
at 10 p.m.

216
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,360
Make sure you have a sound sleep.

217
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,669
Share them yourselves.

218
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:43,850
Two pages for each.

219
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,690
The library is closed at eight.

220
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,050
Go back and sleep early today.

221
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,060
Meet at the canteen at 7 a.m. tomorrow.

222
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,260
Who is Lin Zhaoxi?

223
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,640
What do you mean?

224
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,150
Zhang Liang is Marlford.

225
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,480
Mr. Zhang is Snape.

226
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,600
Who is Lin Zhaoxi?

227
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,540
She must be Hermione.

228
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,080
Are you Harry Potter?

229
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,620
Of course not.

230
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,180
Pei Zhi is obviously Harry Potter.

231
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,100
Miracle Boy.

232
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,740
I'm Ron,

233
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:12,680
just hanging around.

234
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,040
What about me? Who am I?

235
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,620
You...

236
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,200
Neville Longbottom.

237
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,060
You are just like Neville.

238
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,230
Useless at first

239
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,060
but great in the end.

240
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,540
Neville was great later?

241
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,730
Yes. Really great.

242
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,280
Okay, I'll be Neville.

243
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,140
Wait.

244
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,880
You're still useless.

245
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:31,730
Study hard.

246
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,590
You've never worked there?

247
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,580
Fine.

248
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,210
Okay, let's drink some other day. Okay.

249
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,460
It's me.

250
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,890
How about the thing I asked you to do?

251
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,960
I don't need a reason to change my job.

252
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,510
The traffic in the city center is too heavy.

253
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,920
I want to go to the suburb to relax.

254
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,030
How can I get stuck by motorcycle?

255
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,370
Can I fly over someone's head?

256
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,230
Okay, don't talk too much.

257
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,780
Really?

258
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,430
Fine.

259
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,780
I can do anything.

260
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:24,330
OK.

261
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,440
Help me confirm it.

262
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:27,710
Okay.

263
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,060
I'll buy you a drink next time.

264
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,450
Thank you, bro.

265
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:31,580
Okay.

266
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,180
I just heard that

267
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,780
you are buying someone a drink.

268
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,060
Why don't you buy me a drink?

269
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,030
Tonight.

270
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:40,090
Really?

271
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,550
I am just kidding.

272
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,480
I mean it.

273
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,900
I heard it right.

274
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,940
Penny pincher is buying me a drink.

275
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,480
You've never been

276
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,140
that generous to a man.

277
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,410
Did something good happen?

278
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,260
To celebrate.

279
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,100
I'm quitting again.

280
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,090
If you quit,

281
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,720
what about Yao upstairs?

282
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,770
It's already in the past. I dumped her.

283
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,200
Another one.

284
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,530
I won't play with you anymore.

285
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,790
It's finally quiet.

286
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,370
These kids...

287
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,710
Don't say that.

288
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,460
We're at all the same age.

289
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,590
You're right.

290
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,630
But I'm older psychologically.

291
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,350
You also tested your mental age?

292
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,850

I don't want to be Harry.

296
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:48,730
I want to be Ron.

297
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,540
Why?

298
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,420
Tell me.

299
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:50,840
I swear

300
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,900
I won't tell anyone else.

301

According to the rules of training camp,

turn off the lights

your energy and strength.

346
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,760
The exam is coming tomorrow.

347
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,510
I'm not confident.

348
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,390
You've been working so hard these days.

349
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,930
You can handle the exam.

350
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,850
I don't know

351
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,710
what I've learnt these days.

352
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,310
I think I've learned a lot

353
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,580
and I don't seem to understand anything.

354
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,540
Lin Zhaoxi.

355
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,630
I'm afraid I'll make you be eliminated.

356
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,090
It's okay.

357
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,580
Don't think too much.

358
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:49,920
I'm here.

359
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,860
14 teams

360
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,330
will take the exam.

361
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,390
The teams with average score ranking the 12th,

362
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,480
the 13th and 14th

363
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,090
will leave the camp.

364
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,500
Now I'll announce the results.

365
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,740
The first place, Zhang Liang's team.

366
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,680
Great.

367
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,310
Zhang Liang, 93. Liu Xu, 90.

368
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,700
Wang Feng, 88.

369
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,010
Shi Zhe, 82.

370
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,370
Chen Chengcheng 76.

371
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,170
The average score is 85.8.

372
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,460
The second place is Zhao Hongliang's team.

373
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:21,750
Zhao Hongliang, 81.

374
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:22,870
Yan Su, 79.

375
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,130
Qian Zhengyi, 83.

376
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,220
Du Feng, 80.

377
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,550
Lu Ang, 77.

378
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,000
The average score is 80.

379
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,390
75 minus 16.

380
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,530
There are 59 left.

381
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,260
Will Mr. Zhang only leave 5 students

382
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,310
to participate in the competition in the end?

383
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,280
We don't need to guess

384
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,260
Mr. Zhang's thoughts.

385
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,300
Just do our job.

386
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,730
You said you'll buy me dinner.

387
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,390
When?

388
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:46,580
If you explain to

389
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,780
their parents alone,

390
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,140
I'll buy you dinner.

391
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,620
You're not going?

392
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,380
No.

393
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,560
The breeze blows, the water is cold.

394
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,640
The heroes are gone, but never return.

395
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:04,740
He's here.

396
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,700
Hello, parents.

397
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,420
I'm Xie Ran from the training camp.

398
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,400
You can call me Xie.

399
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:11,540
Please bless me.

400
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,099
God blesses us.

401
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,329
The seventh place, Pei Zhi's team.

402
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,339
Great.

403
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:15,349
Pei Zhi, 100.

404
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,329
Why does he get full marks again?

405
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,950
Dang Aimin, 70.

406
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,910
Liao Tianhua, 73.

407
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:27,369
Zheng Bingqing, 64.

408
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,800
Zou Wenchao, 59.

409
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,510
The average score is 73.2.

410
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,260
Here's the thing.

411
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,920
Let me explain.

412
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,310
Their team's average score

413
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,240
is not high enough

414
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,470
so they're eliminated.

415
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,190
We...

416
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,030
We have

417
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,350
the rules of elimination.

418
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,470
The 11th place...

419
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,320
This team is lucky.

420
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,110
Ultraman blesses us.

421
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,100
Light Envoy blesses us.

422
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,740
The average score is only 0.5 points higher than

423
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,130
that of the 12th place

424
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,320
who is about to be eliminated.

425
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,670
The 11th place, Lin Zhaoxi's team.

426
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,720
Yes!

427
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,990
Lin Zhaoxi, 95.

428
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,600
Lu Zhihao, 72.

429
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,770
Shao Mingchen, 62.

430
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,440
Yao Xiaotian, 60.

431
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,650
Yu Tianjiao, 55.

432
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,540
The average score is 68.8.

433
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,000
It's okay.

434
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,400
We passed.

435
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,520
Lin Zhaoxi, your team is in danger.

436
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,820
In the next exam,

437
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,660
you must work harder.

438
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:28,780
Yes, sir.

439
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,240
Those who haven't

440
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,030
been called

441
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,370
are in the last three groups.

442
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,850
I won't announce the results.

443
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,010
If you want,

444
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,220
you can go to Mr. Li

445
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,580
to get your test paper back.

446
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,250
Your parents have arrived.

447
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,080
You can go back to your dorms

448
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,400
and pack your luggage.

449
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:53,660
I wish you

450
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,440
a relaxing summer vacation.

451
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,450
Everyone who stays,

452
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,460
in next ten days,

453
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,350
will have the mid-term exam

454
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,420
of the training camp.

455
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,980
Another exam?

456
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,580
The ranking still depends on the average score of your team.

457
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,210
But there is a new rule.

458
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,700
From now to the day before the exam,

459
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,660
you are allowed to

460
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,460
change your team members

461
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,790
with the specified number of people.

462
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,470
If a team

463
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,940
has less than five members

464
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,470
because some members are leaving,

465
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,680
this team will be canceled.

466
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,380
The rest of this team will

467
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,750
either join another team

468
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,260
or go home.

469
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,460
In the end, no matter

470
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,330
how many teams take

471
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,640
in the next exam,

472
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,750
half of the teams

473
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,060
will be eliminated.

474
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:39,960
Sir.

475
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,390
If the number of the groups

476
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,290
taking the exam is an odd number,

477
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,900
what about the team in the middle?

478
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:44,910
It's simple.

479
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,170
They'll be eliminated together.

480
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,670
Those who want to stay, keep working.

481
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,860
Go to the teacher if you want to go home.

482
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:53,620
Good luck.

483
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,620
This is too fast.

484
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,600
I heard Mr. Li and Mr. Meng

485
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,670
have packed their luggage

486
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,500
already.

487
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,780
It's really cruel.

488
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,790
I'm going back to my dorm.

489
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,780
What's wrong?

490
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,500
I'm not feeling well.

491
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:56,130
Hello? Who are you calling for?

492
00:20:58,930 --> 00:20:59,930
I want to quit.

493
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,260
Why?

494
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,460
We passed.

495
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,220
I miss home.

496
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,630
I miss my parents.

497
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,500
I don't want to take exams anymore.

498
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,140
No, you can't leave.

499
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,300
Why?

500
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,630
You're not my mother.

501
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,620
Who are you to tell me what to do?

502
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,510
I'm leaving.

503
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,020
You can find someone with higher scores

504
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:19,810
to join your team.

505
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,540
I don't want to be a burden.

506
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,600
No, Xiaotian. I'm sorry.

507
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,880
I was anxious just now.

508
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:28,070
I mean we need you.

509
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,500
Stop lying.

510
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,620
Who would need a student

511
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,540
who only got 60 points?

512
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,340
Xiaotian.

513
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,940
No one thinks you are a burden.

514
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:39,980
But I think so.

515
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,440
I've been working hard for days.

516
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:43,860
But

517
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,480
I almost failed.

518
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,520
I've never got

519
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,270
such a low score in school.

520
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,110
I want to leave too.

521
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,340
This time, I'm No.11.

522
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,950
I'll definitely be eliminated next time.

523
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,980
It's better to leave voluntarily.

524
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,480
Who says we will be eliminated?

525
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,220
We still have time to improve.

526
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,380
It's useless even if we have time.

527
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:04,950
I'm an idiot.

528
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,460
It's useless to learn.

529
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,470
No, Chenchen.

530
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,550
Don't think like that.

531
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:09,900
You're smart.

532
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,890
Lin Zhaoxi, your call.

533
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:15,940
Call?

534
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,220
Where did you get the phone?

535
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,230
A public phone call for you.

536
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,400
Who would call me?

537
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,360
It's true.

538
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,140
He said he is your master.

539
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,400
My master?

540
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:26,700
Lin?

541
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:30,900
Well...

542
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,380
Xiaotian and Chenchen.

543
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,840
I am begging you.

544
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,210
Don't leave.

545
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,220
Tianjiao, you...

546
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,700
I'll talk to you later.

547
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,230
Huan Juan, Pei Zhi.

548
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,090
Help me persuade them.

549
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,070
Go to the canteen first.

550
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:43,950
I'll see you later.

551
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,220
Let's go to the canteen.

552
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,300
Hello?

553
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,260
Lin Zhaoxi?

554
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,060
Yes.

555
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,420
It's me.

556
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:14,010
What time is it over there?

557
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,260
Is it dark?

558
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,970
I'm just in the suburb.

559
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,590
I'm not abroad.

560
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,010
You have no sense of humor.

561
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,580
It's not funny at all.

562
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,600
Why did you call me?

563
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,700
Didn't you call me a while ago?

564
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:28,520
I didn't catch it.

565
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,320
I was studying

566
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,020
some profound math problems.

567
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,670
I just want to give you a reply.

568
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,500
No way.

569
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,510
This is a public phone.

570
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,780
How did you know it was me?

571
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,040
I checked the number.

572
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,810
Who else would call me

573
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,700
in the suburb?

574
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,540
How did you know

575
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,600
someone would answer?

576
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,340
Are you nearby?

577
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,110
Enough.

578
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,380
Stop looking around.

579
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,400
You think too much.

580
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,500
I'm at home.

581
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,790
Suddenly showing up

582
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,860
is for kids.

583
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,290
You're lucky.

584
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,180
My classmate just passed by.

585
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,380
What do you mean by lucky?

586
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,490
Let me tell you.

587
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,790
I called you when I recalled.

588
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,710
I called you when I recalled.

589
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,780
I...

590
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,400
It took me several days to get through.

591
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,580
Alright.

592
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,310
How is your camp?

593
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,300
Not good.

594
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,910
We have a lot of exams.

595
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,340
If I fail, I have to leave.

596
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,140
It's stressful.

597
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,260
You haven't passed the exam yet.

598
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,660
No.

599
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,350
We take exams

600
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,700
in groups.

601
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,270
Today, our team

602
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,230
almost got eliminated.

603
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,410
Listen.

604
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,850
Zhang Shuping is only good at this.

605
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,210
I mean it.

606
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,090
Forcing kids to move forward.

607
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,790
If our class teacher

608
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,070
had used his way,

609
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:40,790
with his IQ,

610
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,790
he would have been the first to be eliminated.

611
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,580
What's going on

612
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,440
between you and Mr. Zhang?

613
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,020
Don't ask too much about adults.

614
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,850
Let me tell you.

615
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,130
Zhang Shuping

616
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,280
is a

617
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,020
a fan of the Talent Theory.

618
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,020
You know?

619
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,490
As long as you show that

620
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,840
you're talented enough in front of him

621
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,140
and play according to his rules,

622
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,380
he may leave you some room.

623
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,550
What if I don't want to follow

624
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,340
his rules?

625
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:04,620
You're done.

626
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,830
You should know by his appearance.

627
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:07,620
Narrow-minded.

628
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,300
Normal people never look like that, right?

629
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:09,980
Wait.

630
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,480
Why are you so mean?

631
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,090
There is more truth than elegance in my words.

632
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,400
Bye.

633
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,570
How can you eat so much

634
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,290
without getting fat?

635
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,150
I won't get fat.

636
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,520
Come with me.

637
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,780
What did Lin tell you?

638
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,210
He just wanted to know

639
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,070
about our situation.

640
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,580
Does he have any suggestions?

641
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,500
No.

642
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:48,620
Fine.

643
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:49,780
In the next exam,

644
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,080
we must

645
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,030
rank in the top two.

646
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:54,560
If one of our teams gets eliminated,

647
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:56,390
our plan will be

648
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,460
in vain.

649
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,060
Any ideas?

650
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,580
Nothing at all.

651
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:04,980
What?

652
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,770
I want to talk to Zhang Shuping.

653
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,820
They are always mysterious.

654
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,080
What are they talking about?

655
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,680
I know their secret.

656
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:16,570
You know?

657
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,210
We are in the same class.

658
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,110
Do you want to know?

659
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:20,940
Yes.

660
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:22,070
Come here.

661
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,370
They are in a relationship.

662
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,010
Impossible.

663
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:30,660
Sit down.

664
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,800
Why are you so excited?

665
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,630
I think we are still young.

666
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,470
That's impossible.

667
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,880
Otherwise, how can it be puppy love?

668
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,290
Some people become mature earlier.

669
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,760
Maybe you used your strength

670
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,740
to develop your brain.

671
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,220
You know nothing about love.

672
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:10,860
You work really hard.

673
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,790
Unfortunately,

674
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,710
you didn't get 80 points.

675
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,120
Do you remember our promise?

676
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,660
If I leave,

677
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,500
your team won't have enough members.

678
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,220
Don't worry about that.

679
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,070
I asked Li Ming to replace you.

680
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:30,510
Isn't Li Ming

681
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:31,530
the leader of Team Two?

682
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,220
Li Ming got 85 this time.

683
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,090
He got such a high score

684
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,220
but he was dragged down by his team members.

685
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,430
He ranked ninth.

686
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,030
If he doesn't join my team,

687
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,510
he will be eliminated next time.

688
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:41,510
If he joins in my team,

689
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,890
he can not only stay till the end

690
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,910
but also get a chance to join the municipal team.

691
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,260
What should he choose?

692
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:50,120
What about the other members

693
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,800
in Team Two?

694
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,660
Why don't you go to Li Ming's team

695
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:54,290
to make up the number?

696
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:55,780
If you go,

697
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,660
you can call it Chen ChengCheng's team.

698
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:00,370
I'm not going. I'd rather go home.

699
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:04,250
Chengcheng.

700
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,420
After all, we are friends.

701
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,490
I don't have to kick you out.

702
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,120
But if you want to stay,

703
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,140
you have to show your value.

704
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,910
I will try my best to learn.

705
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:16,900
I'm not talking about scores.

706
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:18,740
Chengcheng.

707
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:20,520
Don't you think Lin Zhaoxi

708
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,330
is so annoying?

709
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,400
Help me get rid of her.

710
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:37,030
It's hard.

711
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,760
It's too hard for me.

712
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:44,980
What are you and Lin Zhaoxi doing?

713
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,510
It should be easy to pass

714
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,100
if we're in a team.

715
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,310
Why we have to

716
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:50,890
work with Yu Tianjiao and the others?

717
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,150
Lin Zhaoxi drew

718
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,300
on the paper.

719
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,420
And you avoided me in the canteen.

720
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,900
What are you doing?

721
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,180
This is a secret between me and Lin Zhaoxi.

722
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,660
I can't tell you.

723
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,530
Aren't we good friends?

724
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,180
What is it?

725
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,400
You can't even tell me?

726
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,110
It's not that I can't.

727
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,180
You won't believe me

728
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,570
even I told you.

729
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:20,450
How do you know if you don't tell me?

730
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,610
Are you two

731
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,770
really dating?

732
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,870
What are you talking about?

733
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,030
Otherwise,

734
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,100
what are you hiding from me?

735
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,970
Fine, I'll tell you.

736
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,420
But you have to swear

737
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:55,590
you won't tell anyone else.

738
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,510
Okay, I swear.

739
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,870
I will never tell anyone.

740
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,870
Okay, keep it down.

741
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:06,240
Have you ever

742
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,380
heard of parallel world?

743
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,150
5:52.

744
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,100
You're punctual.

745
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:34,760
And for so many days,

746
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:35,420
you keep doing well.

747
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,380
Good.

748
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,760
Are you here to check on me?

749
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,620
I want to talk to you.

750
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,780
I have something to tell you too.

751
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,740
I've been teaching Math Olympiad for ten years.

752
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,310
I'm sure you and Pei Zhi

753
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,480
are rare geniuses.

754
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,100
Pei Zhi is a genius. I'm not.

755
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,780
I'm sure about that.

756
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,300
I designed the teaming mode

757
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,540
hoping to help the top students

758
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,420
gather automatically

759
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,830
and help each other.

760
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,500
It's not hard to understand, right?

761
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,750
But what I can't understand is

762
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,570
you always hang out with

763
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,840
with students with poor qualifications.

764
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:16,500
What are you thinking?

765
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,310
Because I want everyone to

766
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,410
graduate successfully.

767
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,520
Those without talent

768
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:23,540
will leave sooner or later.

769
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,460
This is a selection training camp,

770
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,260
not a pure summer camp.

771
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,390
So they deserve to be discouraged if they're not talented?

772
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,990
Have you ever thought

773
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,860
that the rules you designed

774
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,670
may destroy

775
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,860
the students' confidence

776
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,050
and even make them hate math?

777
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,460
Then give up.

778
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,180
Why do they insist?

779
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,430
Because no one wants to fail.

780
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,610
Moreover, you designed

781
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:46,470
such an embarrassing failure.

782
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:47,860
Do you know

783
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,170
the setbacks in childhood

784
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,360
may affect

785
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:51,590
one's whole life in the future?

786
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:55,930
I am the example.

787
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:59,630
How old are you to talk about life?

788
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,100
When you reach my age and

789
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,200
at my position,

790
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,480
you will understand

791
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,350
what I'm doing.

792
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,750
Now I'm as tall as you.

793
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,680
What do you think the training camp

794
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,850
should be like?

795
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,630
Cultivating math interest,

796
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,920
training logical thinking.

797
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,630
and feeling the happiness of math,

798
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,390
instead of pain.

799
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:36,050
If you want to be happy,

800
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,760
don't participate in competitions.

801
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,820
Lin Zhaoxi. Mr. Zhang.

802
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,390
I really hope

803
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,460
you two can compete

804
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,180
on behalf of the municipal team.

805
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,330
But only if you are still here.

806
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:53,590
I won't change the rules

807
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,660
for anyone,

808
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,790
even for a genius.

809
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,590
Don't worry.

810
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,220
You will return to

811
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,160
the Strawberry World.

812
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,030
What are you talking about?

813
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:20,950
Hua Juan told me.

814
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,130
You came from the Strawberry World.

815
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,000
You believe that?

816
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,200
I believe you.

817
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,270
Are you really an adult?

818
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:31,740
An adult from another world?

819
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,220
Don't worry.

820
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,610
I won't tell anyone else.

821
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:37,750
I will help you.

822
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,380
It's true.

823
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:43,460
That's great.

824
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,110
What did you say?

825
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,110
I will help you and Hua Juan

826
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:47,820
go back home.

827
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,410
I'm a man of my word.

828
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,180
What's the Strawberry World like?

829
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,980
It's pretty much like here.

830
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,370
Do you know me there?

831
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:09,389
Yes.

832
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,480
Are we close?

833
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,239
It's hard to say.

834
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,090
Someone is leaving again.

835
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,870
Will the person be from our team?

836
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,480
Go back to the boys' dorm and ask around.

837
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:33,699
I'll go back to the girls' dorm.

838
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,940
We have to find out who is leaving.

839
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,929
See you in the library.

840
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,260
Are you leaving?

841
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,570
What's wrong?

842
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,540
You're in Li Ming's team.

843
00:34:58,570 --> 00:34:59,210
Why are you leaving?

844
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,820
Li Ming joined Zhang Liang's team.

845
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:03,970
There are only four people left in the team.

846
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,220
No one wants to join us.

847
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,360
So we have to quit.

848
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:09,430
This is the rule.

849
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:10,990
Why don't you try

850
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:11,970
to join another team?

851
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,820
Our grades are average.

852
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,960
Otherwise, Li Ming wouldn't have left.

853
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,410
Someone in the team said it's good.

854
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,730
Not having enough members

855
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,070
sounds better than failing in the exam.

856
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:28,050
If our team wants you,

857
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,140
would you come?

858
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,620
But my grades are not good.

859
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:34,820
Is that what you think?

860
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,500
Do you want to leave?

861
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,170
As for the four of us,

862
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,570
Qu Ge and I don't want to leave.

863
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,660
Qu Ge?

864
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,020
Actually, I think

865
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,140
passing one more exam is enough.

866
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:49,730
I want to try again.

867
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,740
Join our team.

868
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,630
Let Qu Ge join Pei Zhi's team.

869
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,550
We all need one more member.

870
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:57,710
Is that okay?

871
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,960
Why are you helping us?

872
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,450
It depends on you.

873
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,990
If you want to leave,

874
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,430
I have no choice.

875
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,420
But if you want to stay,

876
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,540
this is the power of courage.

877
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,280
Join us.

878
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,420
Even if we can't stay until the end,

879
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:20,810
we can help each other

880
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,620
and go as far as we can.

881
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,800
Guys, listen to me.

882
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:31,050
This is Qu Ge. This is Wang Lu.

883
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,220
From now on,

884
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,320
they're one of us.

885
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:34,980
Welcome!

886
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,860
Applause!

887
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,780
Have a seat.

888
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,360
Mingchen, do you have any opinion?

889
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,300
No.

890
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,650
We can't

891
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,970
pass the next exam anyway.

892
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,210
You can invite anyone.

893
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,710
Qu Ge and Wang Lu

894
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,540
are good.

895
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,420
One is 65

896
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,580
and the other is 68.

897
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,780
They're even lower than our average.

898
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,720
Xiaotian and I are not going

899
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,580
to take the next exam.

900
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:03,950
We'll have fun

901
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,840
in the last few days.

902
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,680
We'll quit before the exam.

903
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,520
We won't burden your average scores.

904
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,530
Xiaotian, let's go.

905
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,400
I'm sorry.

906
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,920
I shouldn't bother you.

907
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,480
It has nothing to do with you two.

908
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:28,590
Just focus on your study.

909
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:57,020
I thought

910
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,230
you went after Yao Xiaotian.

911
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,050
Why are you here?

912
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,560
I'm worried about you.

913
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,180
Why should you worry?

914
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,710
You're a girl.

915
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,560
Boys should protect girls.

916
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,040
I'm fine.

917
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,430
At worst, I can't go back.

918
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,710
At worst,

919
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,300
I'll never see

920
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,820
that nagging and stubborn man again.

921
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,700
Who are you talking about?

922
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:25,680
My dad.

923
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,350
Master?

924
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,000
But master is not like what you said.

925
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,890
They are two people.

926
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,100
I don't know why.

927
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,640
Lin is so different

928
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,080
in two worlds.

929
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,020
It's because of you, isn't it?

930
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:53,560
Why did you say that?

931
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,800
My dad said,

932
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,480
since I was born,

933
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,310
he has become

934
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,450
completely different.

935
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,820
Maybe that's how dad is.

936
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,780
Like Digimon Adventure.

937
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,210
Boys-mon Evolution! Papa-mon!

938
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:10,940
When I was young,

939
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,980
I loved watching Digimon Adventure too.

940
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,770
Which one do you like?

941
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,120
Patamon Evolution!

942
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,460
Angemon!

943
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,500
Master.

944
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:26,180
What's wrong? You called again?

945
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:26,810
Have you finished your exam?

946
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,140
Not yet.

947
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:30,550
Then what?

948
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,180
Nothing.

949
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,620
Don't call for nothing.

950
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,390
I'm busy.

951
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,440
I'll hang up if there's nothing else.

952
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,360
Cool. I'm hanging up.

953
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:39,740
Wait.

954
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:43,410
You don't sound like in a good mood.

955
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,500
I'm fine.

956
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,220
Have you had breakfast?

957
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:49,730
Yes.

958
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,400
That means you have strength.

959
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:53,780
Maybe.

960
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:55,510
Come here.

961
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,740
Help me move the books.

962
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:57,630
They're quite heavy.

963
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,500
Come here? Where?

964
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,480
There is a mailroom

965
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,140
at the gate of your base.

966
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,010
I'm here.

967
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,070
That's enough.

968
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,790
My stomach hurts.

969
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,660
You said only kids

970
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:54,160
will show up suddenly.

971
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,660
You can't be so naive.

972
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,530
How can you believe a man?

973
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,170
You'll be cheated when you grow up.

974
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:01,750
That's enough.

975
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:03,210
The powder is on my clothes.

976
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:03,650
Hurry.

977
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,940
I'm a kid.

978
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,200
I don't put on makeup.

979
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,310
See? You got cheated again.

980
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,200
How could you live in the future?

981
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:17,520
Aren't you going back to the Youth Palace?

982
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,190
I've changed my job.

983
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,180
I'm now

984
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,150
a full-time security guard

985
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,110
and a night watchman.

986
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:26,980
How could

987
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:27,740
you find a job here?

988
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:29,060
That's easy.

989
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,950
I am famous in the security area.

990
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:37,690
If I leave one month later,

991
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:38,470
what will you do?

992
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:40,140
I'll change my job.

993
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,870
I always change jobs.

994
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,460
Let me help you.

995
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,180
What?

996
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:49,780
I moved them all last night.

997
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,430
Just kidding.

998
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:57,730
Men are all liars.

999
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:59,190
You've improved.
