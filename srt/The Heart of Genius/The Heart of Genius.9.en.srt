00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,570
in a hurry.

172
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,659
A rabbit from the cartoon?

173
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:36,950
A wild rabbit.

174
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,140
How could a wild rabbit wear clothes?

175
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,460
That's why it's a dream.

176
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,020
Okay, go on.

177
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,740
I followed it secretly

178
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,710
to a tree hole.

179
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,240
I became small there.

180
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,210
I met many strange people

181
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,190
and a pair of cards.

182
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,100
One of them was the Red Queen.

183
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,980
It told me that I have a father.

184
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,060
I think I've heard this story somewhere.

185
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,220
Dad.

186
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,140
Did you have the same dream?

187
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,320
I knew it.

188
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,140
God let us reunite.

189
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,520
I watched it on TV.

190
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,390
On the CCTV-6.

191
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,750
The stories you have read

192
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,700
will affect

193
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:14,540
your subconscious.

194
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,840
It's normal.

195
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,970
Your ability

196
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,010
of talking nonsense

197
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,450
shows that you're indeed my daughter.

198
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,640
Let me ask you something.

199
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,580
Who made me lost?

200
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,090
Who were you calling

201
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,250
when we came out of the identification center?

202
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,360
At this point,

203
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,390
let me tell you the truth.

204
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,060
Back then,

205
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,250
I am an undercover agent

206
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,920
sent by the mathematics department of Yongchuan University

207
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,190
to the counterpart of Sanwei University.

208
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,750
On the day of departure,

209
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,950
my teacher told me

210
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,130
a fortune teller said

211
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,750
he would cost too much

212
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,360
to make achievements.

213
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:58,810
But he didn't believe that.

214
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,330
He thought his life path

215
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,310
should be decided by himself.

216
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,770
Life has its own way.

217
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,870
You don't need to say it if you don't want to.

218
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,560
We're the same.

219
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,740
Come on! We can win!

220
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,630
Lin Zhaoxi, I'm counting on you.

221
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,470
Gold medal! You must win the gold medal!

222
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,440
You must win the gold medal!

223
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,210
Understand it?

224
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,430
Don't worry.

225
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,160
Lu Zhihao.

226
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,460
Don't come back if you lose.

227
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,520
How can I lose?

228
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,630
Don't you know

229
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,420
there are so many excellent students in our team?

230
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,640
So you have to follow them closely.

231
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,760
Don't be a drag.

232
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,140
Liang, we will stay at the base

233
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,240
waiting for you to lead the team to victory and come back.

234
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,960
Pei Zhi is the leader, okay?

235
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,100
Liang is the leader, okay?

236
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,150
Pei is the leader.

237
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,620
Zhang Liang didn't even get 100 points.

238
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,940
Pei got 100 points every time.

239
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,660
That's right, Pei is the leader.

240
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,220
It's enough.

241
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,160
It's enough. Listen to me.

242
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,900
The five students participating in the competition,

243
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,600
come with me.

244
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,300
Get in the car.

245
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:00,620
Let's go.

246
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:01,880
Pei, come on!

247
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,070
When we were young,

248
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:04,930
and went out to for competitions,

249
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:05,950
we were also so spirited and excited

250
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,860
like them.

251
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,630
I really hope

252
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,700
they can win a gold medal

253
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,300
like the team I led last time.

254
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:14,940
When did you ever lead a team?

255
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,520
I led teams every time.

256
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,410
I led students of Grade 8 to Shanghai.

257
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:19,260
That time.

258
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,750
I gave you the chance.

259
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,370
What do you mean?

260
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,870
You violated the school rules.

261
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:24,720
The leading teacher

262
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,610
chose me at last.

263
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,590
He emphasized that

264
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,880
I was more mature and steady.

265
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,900
That's because

266
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,990
you cried.

267
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,780
I made a mistake on purpose

268
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,850
and gave the chance to you.

269
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,130
Then I have to thank you.

270
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:35,630
No need.

271
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,220
We can go now.

272
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,980
Come on! Come on! Come on!

273
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,540
Come on! Come on! Come on!

274
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:46,830
Come on!

275
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:48,260
Come on!

276
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:49,650
Come on!

277
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,090
Come on! Come on! Come on!

278
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,390
Come on! Come on! Come on!

279
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,070
Come on! Come on!

280
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,850
Come on! Come on!

281
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,250
Good luck, everyone.

282
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,300
Bye.

283
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,060
Bye.

284
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,060
You must win the gold medal.

285
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,160
Bye.

286
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,240
[Jin's Olympic Mathematics Competition of the whole province]

287
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,660
These kids are good.

288
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,780
They are good.

289
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,530
Who are these two leaders?

290
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,510
One looks like

291
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,270
a sports player

292
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,360
and another looks like a musician.

293
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,320
Are they here for the Olympic Mathematics Competition?

294
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,140
Isn't that Zhang? I know him.

295
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,520
I'll go and ask him.

296
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:41,580
Zhang.

297
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:43,930
Well.

298
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,600
Why are you also here

299
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,790
leading the primary school team?

300
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,850
But you make a mistake this time.

301
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,720
Your city's elementary school team

302
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,070
always gets the last place.

303
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,310
It won't happen this time.

304
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,110
This is...

305
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,220
He's in charge of security.

306
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,750
What security?

307
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,130
I'm also an instructor.

308
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,480
He's an off-staff member.

309
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,770
He helps me sometimes.

310
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,350
An off-staff member?

311
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,160
There are five students in the group.

312
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,670
I taught three of them. You taught two.

313
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,620
All the 80 students

314
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,700
were chosen by me.

315
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,590
If I didn't teach them,

316
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,520
how could we have the chance to select

317
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,420
the five top students?

318
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,620
Did you take it seriously after I gave you three students?

319
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,330
Seriously? Your class that taught all the students counts?

320
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,390
Why not?

321
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,700
If it didn't count, how could you choose them?

322
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,450
Okay. Okay.

323
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,580
Take your time.

324
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,420
Take your time. Don't be angry.

325
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,560
Keep your voice down. The exam is ongoing. Take your time.

326
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,790
Why are you so interesting?

327
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:24,750
What do you mean?

328
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,340
Weren't you ashamed?

329
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:25,900
You were arguing with me in front of them.

330
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,740
Fine. I don't want to talk to you.

331
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,490
There are 40 minutes left.

332
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,880
Aren't you going to check it again?

333
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,150
No.

334
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:05,690
Lin.

335
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:07,910
The exam is over.

336
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:10,450
How did it go?

337
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,020
I finished it as usual.

338
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,160
You would be all right if you finished it as usual.

339
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,760
Mr. Zhang.

340
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,350
Let’s go and have ice creams.

341
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,110
I'm not going. I have to wait for Liu Xu.

342
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,500
Let’s go. You can bring one for them.

343
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,730
Let's go together, Zhang Liang.

344
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,390
Fine.

345
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,540
Let me make it clear.

346
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,940
I'm doing this for Pei Zhi's invitation.

347
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:28,650
Lin Zhaoxi.

348
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,630
If you want to get my approval,

349
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,420
you have to wait for a few more years.

350
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,510
You're so stubborn.

351
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:32,760
Let's go.

352
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,220
I won't eat. I won't eat.

353
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,410
Zhang.

354
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,540
Are these three your students?

355
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,890
Yes, they are all my students.

356
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,890
Why were they so impatient?

357
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,620
I think you'll lose again this year.

358
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,940
Yes.

359
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,530
Okay, I'll wait for others.

360
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,900
The champion of elementary school teams

361
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,350
of the Jin's Olympic Mathematics Competition

362
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,210
is the team of Anping City.

363
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,470
Bravo! Bravo!

364
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:09,890
Great!

365
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,340
Next, let's welcome

366
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,240
Professor Zeng Qingran from Sanwei University

367
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,950
to give them the medals.

368
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,600
Welcome.

369
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:23,970
Zhaosheng.

370
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,310
Zhaosheng.

371
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,090
Lin Zhaosheng.

372
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,340
Lin Zhaosheng.

373
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,210
Zhaosheng.

374
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,360
Zhang.

375
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:33,920
Everyone has heard that

376
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,770
among your five students, three have got full marks.

377
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:36,900
Where did you find

378
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:37,770
these little monsters?

379
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,250
Calm down.

380
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,260
This year is just the beginning.

381
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,540
Lin Zhaoxi, well done.

382
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,380
Congratulations.

383
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,200
Thank you.

384
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,930
Pei Zhi, cool.

385
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,270
You gave me the call, right?

386
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,570
Come to be my doctoral student

387
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,670
when you grow up.

388
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,880
Congratulations.

389
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,900
Thank you.

390
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:14,090
OK.

391
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,020
Our team is the champion.

392
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,990
What will we choose later?

393
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,100
You're the best, right?

394
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,580
What are you doing?

395
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,220
Give it to Liang.

396
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,620
Liang is the best.

397
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,220
The trophy belongs to Liang.

398
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,710
It's ours.

399
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,860
It's Liang's.

400
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,340
-What are you doing?
-It's Liang's.

401
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,050
Snape.

402
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,780
Snape.

403
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,840
The training camp

404
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,630
is over now.

405
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,250
Guys.

406
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,750
I hope you can continue to work hard

407
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,140
and study hard

408
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:57,020
to learn any subject you are interested in

409
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,100
which is not limited to maths.

410
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:00,760
Remember,

411
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,460
struggle is always a part of life.

412
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:09,220
Let's take a graduation photo later.

413
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:11,170
Go back to your dorms

414
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,089
and change into your clothes.

415
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,329
We'll have a great celebration.

416
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,060
You are the champions.

417
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:22,650
Congratulations.

418
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,450
We are champions!

419
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,050
We are champions!

420
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,620
We are champions!

421
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,420
We are champions!

422
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,460
The moment to decide our destiny is approaching.

423
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:04,940
What have you prepared for?

424
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:09,110
[2014 World Cup Champion, China]

425
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:09,110
[2018 World Cup Champion, France]

426
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:08,380
I left the inheritance

427
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:09,360
for myself.

428
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:10,770
If I become poor in the future,

429
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,980
the Cheese Hua Juan

430
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,990
can use this to buy the lottery.

431
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,430
This is a parallel world. Can it be accurate?

432
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,470
Leave it to fate.

433
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,180
Ji Jiang.

434
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:26,980
Thank you.

435
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,610
For what?

436
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,270
If you weren't so optimistic,

437
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,590
I wouldn't have made it.

438
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,880
Well, I just forced myself.

439
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:39,640
I know

440
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,070
you've been under more pressure than me.

441
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,120
But you could control it greatly.

442
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,200
So you didn't show it.

443
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,060
Well, actors

444
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,820
regard controlling emotions as the basic skill.

445
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:52,610
What about you?

446
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,900
Are you ready to say goodbye to him?

447
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,290
You may never

448
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,830
meet each other again.

449
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,340
I refer to Lin of this world.

450
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,000
You're here.

451
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,080
Dad, the training camp members will take a photo.

452
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:31,860
Will you come?

453
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:32,700
No.

454
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:33,760
I don't want to see

455
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,780
see Zhang Shuping’s ugly face.

456
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,390
Have you forgotten?

457
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,290
You still owe me a photo.

458
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,620
You're waiting for me here.

459
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,390
Okay, I'll go.

460
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,500
Wait for me.

461
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,090
I'll look better in a leather jacket.

462
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,780
Dad, let me ask you a question.

463
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:54,840
Do you think

464
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,130
I have the talent to study maths?

465
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,600
Of course.

466
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:58,930
You are my daughter.

467
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:00,950
If I don't want

468
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,990
to study maths one day,

469
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,110
will you force me to learn it?

470
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,100
Of course.

471
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,460
You're my daughter.

472
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,020
Will you love me forever?

473
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,770
Even if I'm not as smart

474
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,550
as Pei Zhi.

475
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,660
Of course.

476
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,200
You're my daughter.

477
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,610
Dad, you always wonder

478
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,830
why I know

479
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,700
so many things, right?

480
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,530
I admit

481
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,180
I come from another world.

482
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:41,790
I knew it.

483
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,630
In your world,

484
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,970
there is a Red Queen.

485
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,910
Am I right, my little Alice?

486
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,120
Okay.

487
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,200
Okay.

488
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,990
Pei Zhi is here for you.

489
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,480
Let me change my shoes.

490
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:34,950
Are you going back?

491
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,840
I won't meet you again.

492
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,570
I'm leaving.

493
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:46,940
In this world,

494
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,340
there's another Lin Zhaoxi.

495
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,160
A real me

496
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,170
in this world.

497
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,770
She may be gentle,

498
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,660
sensitive and fragile.

499
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,740
Take care of her for me.

500
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,720
I will. I promise.

501
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,970
Can I hold your hand again?

502
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:26,710
Let's go.

503
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,250
Let's go.

504
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,670
Brat.

505
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,150
You are holding my daughter's hand.

506
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,180
I have to keep an eye on you from now on.

507
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:40,330
Yu Tianjiao.

508
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,580
Yao Xiaotian.

509
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,060
Lin Zhaoxi, what are you doing?

510
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:44,520
Hurry up.

511
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,450
Lin Zhaoxi, come here. We're waiting for you.

512
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,210
I'm coming.

513
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,150
So fierce.

514
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,890
What are you doing?

515
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:57,720
Okay, everyone.

516
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,990
Stand still.

517
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,380
Yes. You need

518
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,060
to be happy. Be happy

519
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,310
Yes, smile. Yes.

520
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:04,990
Yes, when taking the photo,

521
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,060
don't blink.

522
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,230
Okay, let's take one.

523
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,660
Okay, let's try it.

524
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:10,330
Listen to my command.

525
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,300
Three, two, one.

526
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,640
Cheese.

527
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,580
Very good.

528
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:35,720
Hold on. Hold on.

529
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,620
One more.

530
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:37,570
Okay.

531
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,630
Let's take another one.

532
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,110
Okay.

533
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,300
Attention.

534
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,460
One more.

535
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,880
Pay attention to your mood.

536
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,830
Smile. Yes.

537
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,630
The mouth. Smile.

538
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,400
Okay.

539
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:49,340
Three, two, one.

540
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,430
Cheese.

541
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,020
Very good.

542
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,220
Sorry, sir.

543
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,590
I closed my eyes.

544
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,540
One more.

545
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:06,850
Let's take one more photo.

546
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:07,980
Okay.

547
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,190
Okay. The mood. Be aware of your mood.

548
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,810
The expression. Yes. Smile.

549
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:15,140
Three, two, one.

550
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,660
I blinked too.

551
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,420
One more.

552
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,860
OK, one more.

553
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,070
The last one.

554
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:31,710
The last one.

555
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,320
Okay.

556
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,780
Three, two, one.

557
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:41,860
Okay.

558
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,130
One more.

559
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,180
We've been working so hard.

560
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,870
What have we done?

561
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,150
I'm sorry.

562
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,820
I was wrong.

563
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:04,750
The photo.

564
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,250
Go back.

565
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,500
It was my delusion from the beginning.

566
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,270
It's not your fault.

567
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,410
Who would have thought that?

568
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:14,970
It's a waste of emotions.

569
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:20,940
What's your plan?

570
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:24,900
What plan?

571
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,180
Go back to the welfare home.

572
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,180
Since I'm still young,

573
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,270
I'll find another family to adopt me

574
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,300
and be their son.

575
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,240
If I take the art exam in the future,

576
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,260
maybe I can do my previous job.

577
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:39,930
Aren’t you going

578
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,170
to find Professor Ji?

579
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,340
Maybe

580
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,620
he will believe our story.

581
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,810
You can ask him to adopt you.

582
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,100
My parents are

583
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,350
very traditional people.

584
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,620
They won't believe me.

585
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,880
They'll think I'm a liar

586
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,810
or a lunatic.

587
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,460
How about

588
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,930
let Lin adopt you?

589
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,340
We'll be siblings.

590
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,540
Then we can work together

591
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,380
in the future.

592
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,850
Think about it.

593
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,510
We know

594
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,790
many plots

595
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,700
yet to be filmed.

596
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,370
I also have to keep an eye on this guy.

597
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,140
As for songs that haven't been released,

598
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,880
we can write them down in advance.

599
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,410
Then we can script, direct, act,

600
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,700
write, create and sing by ourselves.

601
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,930
We will both become superstars.

602
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,290
Good idea. Just like Xia Luo in the movie Goodbye Mr. Loser.

603
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:28,820
But why

604
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,240
you're the elder sister and I'm the younger brother?

605
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:32,580
Look at your height.

606
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,220
Look at

607
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,570
your height in the Strawberry World.

608
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,970
My birthday is in February. What about you?

609
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:39,670
I...

610
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:40,890
I'm a rescued

611
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,820
child from kidnapping.

612
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,390
I can't even find my biological parents.

613
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,910
I don't know

614
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,820
when my birthday is.

615
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,040
Maybe in January.

616
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,900
So I'm your elder brother.

617
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:48,730
No.

618
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,290
My birthday is on February 20th.

619
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,460
The probability of you being a elder brother

620
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,870
is less than 14 percent.

621
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,310
It's still possible.

622
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,840
Why should I adopt him?

623
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,350
Buy one and get one free?

624
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:02,950
Hua Juan.

625
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,060
I'm not against you.

626
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:07,340
Dad, you promised me.

627
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,660
I really owe you.

628
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:14,650
Why are you sad?

629
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,290
Are you unhappy to be my son?

630
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,690
Of course not.

631
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,770
You are the best father in the world.

632
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:22,940
I'm flattered.

633
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,820
I know myself well.

634
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,670
I'm okay with not being the worst in the world.

635
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,190
Hua Juan, don't worry.

636
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,190
Since I promised you,

637
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,400
I'll take good care of you.

638
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,770
Well, I have enough food anyway.

639
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,570
I'll let you grow up.

640
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,220
Are you okay?

641
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,700
I'm fine.

642
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:01,440
I'm just thinking

643
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,800
if I should

644
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,990
change my name into Lin Aimin.

645
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,500
Whatever.

646
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,380
You can call me whatever you want.

647
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:09,870
You can also call me Ji Jiang.

648
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,460
Why Ji Jiang?

649
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,790
Isn't it good to call you Hua Juan?

650
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:13,810
I'm used to it.

651
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,100
Gou Dan.

652
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,520
Dang Aimin.

653
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,700
Hua Juan.

654
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,100
Ji Jiang.

655
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,410
Lin Aimin.

656
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,330
I guess I'm not the smartest.

657
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,390
But I have the most names.

658
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:40,890
Not bad.

659
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,330
We did it.

660
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:18,070
I think so.

661
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:19,980
We're back.

662
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,150
No, I need some time to rest.

663
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,200
Have we been missing

664
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,230
for months?

665
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,050
That would be troublesome.

666
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:36,380
The famous idol actor Ji Jiang is missing.

667
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:37,540
His life is uncertain.

668
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,540
It will become the headline.

669
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,860
It's okay. The time hasn't changed.

670
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:43,860
But

671
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:46,550
will we

672
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:48,820
jump

673
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,960
to a new world?

674
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,180
Let me check the computer.

675
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:07,880
Okay.

676
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,380
[Ji Jiang]

677
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,650
The Strawberry World!

678
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:32,460
We're back!

679
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,260
We're back!

680
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,280
We're back!

681
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,390
We're back!

682
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,250
Ji Jiang. Mr. Ji.

683
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,560
Just call me Hua Juan.

684
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:48,950
We are almost siblings.

685
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:52,890
I'll answer this call.

686
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:53,520
Okay.

687
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:54,940
I'll have some water.

688
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,240
Okay.

689
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,380
Xiaomeng.

690
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,670
Don't worry. Calm down.

691
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:05,940
What happened?

692
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:07,860
My dad is awake.

693
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,380
Xiaomeng.

694
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,940
Xi, you're finally come.

695
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,080
Dad, you're awake.

696
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,090
Dad?

697
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:23,910
Dad?

698
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,100
Why doesn't he respond?

699
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:27,060
Did you call the doctor?

700
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:29,240
The nurse has informed Director Ma.

701
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,440
I'm Lin Zhaoxi, dad.

702
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,900
-Ji Jiang?
-Dad.

703
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,480
It's alive. Alive.

704
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,990
Xi, look.

705
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,010
This is Ji Jiang. He is alive.

706
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,440
Why are you here?

707
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,140
Here's the hospital.

708
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:46,840
We are friends.

709
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,610
You're the friend of my friend's.

710
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,460
Xiaomeng. Xiaomeng. Xiaomeng.

711
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,290
Tell me

712
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,300
what happened to my dad.

713
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,060
Well.

714
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:53,890
What happened just now?

715
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,060
Here's the thing.

716
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,820
Uncle Lin suddenly woke up just now.

717
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,340
Uncle Lin, you're awake.

718
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,060
I'll call the nurse.

719
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,130
Nurse.

720
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,860
Uncle Lin, why are you up?

721
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:18,660
Do you feel better?

722
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,820
Where am I?

723
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:21,690
Hello.

724
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,780
Please take a rest here.

725
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,490
I'll call Director Ma.

726
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,430
Thank you.

727
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,060
What's wrong with me?

728
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,460
You were hit by someone.

729
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,810
Here's the hospital.

730
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,500
Who are you?

731
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,550
I'm Xiaomeng.

732
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,620
Bao Xiaomeng.

733
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,040
Xiaomeng. Who is Xiaomeng?

734
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,750
Uncle Lin, take a rest.

735
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,490
I'll call Xi now.

736
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,690
I need to go to the toilet.

737
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,360
Let me help you.

738
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,490
Go. Here.

739
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,370
This way.

740
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,450
This way, Uncle Lin.

741
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,830
Can you do it alone?

742
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:00,690
Do you need me

743
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,490
to find a care worker for you?

744
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,160
Uncle Lin, you can call me if you want something.

745
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,330
I'll wait outside.

746
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,210
Drink what? Drink what?

747
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:40,870
Drink what?

748
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:41,429
Qiu Yue.

749
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,040
Let's go.

750
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:43,920
I'm coming.

751
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,010
I'm not going to the library.

752
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,580
You can go.

753
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,590
Aren't you going to the library?

754
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,590
No.

755
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,469
Study hard. Don't slack off.

756
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:55,889
I'm leaving.

757
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:03,900
Uncle Lin.

758
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,300
Uncle Lin, what's wrong?

759
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,160
My face.

760
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:11,870
My face.

761
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,380
My face.

762
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:16,730
My face.

763
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,490
What happened to my face?

764
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:21,070
Your face is fine.

765
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,100
Why am I so old?

766
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,460
You're not old.

767
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:25,930
You're always like this.

768
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:26,820
You don't look like

769
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,020
a man in his forties.

770
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,260
Who is 40?

771
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,550
Who is over 40?

772
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:34,980
I'm 20.

773
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:36,760
No.

774
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,440
Uncle Lin, what are you talking about?

775
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,720
Don't make me confused.

776
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,060
What year is it?

777
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,420
It's 2018.

778
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,500
Uncle Lin. Uncle Lin.

779
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,770
Nurse!

780
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:02,180
Then...

781
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,350
Then we took him

782
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,260
on the bed.

783
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,830
He woke up soon.

784
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,820
Then he became like this.

785
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,840
No matter how we talked to him,

786
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,450
he didn't respond.

787
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,440
Why do I feel

788
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,540
your dad has also jumped to another world?

789
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,880
And he traveled in the opposite direction from us.

790
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:25,850
How is that possible?

791
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,990
Dad, look at me.

792
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:35,930
Dear audience,

793
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,410
this is

794
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,190
the 24-hour Gossip.

795
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,580
The news that Ji Jiang was suspected to be dating with someone

796
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,520
has been spread for a few days.

797
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:42,900
His agent team

798
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,370
finally gave an official reply.

799
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,030
It said that the love affair

800
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,510
was totally groundless.

801
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:57,820
Dad.

802
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,310
Who are you calling?

803
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:01,130
Who are you?

804
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,250
Are you awake?

805
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,620
I'm your daughter, Lin Zhaoxi.

806
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:06,920
You're so funny.

807
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,300
I don't have a daughter like you.

808
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,060
But you're quite cute.

809
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,140
Hey,

810
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,220
do you know

811
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,300
how did I get hurt?

812
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,420
Don't you remember?

813
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,260
Why would I ask you if I remember?

814
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,250
Did you send me to the hospital?

815
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,130
Don't tease me.

816
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,610
Look at me again.

817
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:24,900
You really don't remember me?

818
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,990
You look familiar.

819
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,590
Which department are you from?

820
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,300
Which department?

821
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,720
Aren't we from the same college?

822
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,970
I'm your daughter.

823
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,340
It's 2018 now.

824
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,980
You are an accountant in the finance office.

825
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:42,910
You went

826
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,090
to the finance office at night

827
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,600
and got attacked.

828
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,130
You act well.

829
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:50,070
But there's a flaw

830
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:50,930
in your logic.

831
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,790
I, Lin Zhaosheng, am a maths genius.

832
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,180
How could I be an accountant?

833
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,700
The trick is enough.

834
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,180
I believe you.

835
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:00,540
Are there a lot of people

836
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,140
waiting outside?

837
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:02,140
If I say I believe you,

838
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,190
they will rush in and say I'm cheated,

839
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:04,860
right?

840
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:05,970
Qiu Yue.

841
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,740
Shuping, come in.

842
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,300
This game is boring.

843
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,100
Qiu Yue.

844
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,600
Well. Lin Zhaosheng.

845
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,020
Take a rest here.

846
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,300
I'll call the doctor for you, okay?

847
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,140
Wait for me.

848
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,040
Thank you.

849
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,120
What's your name?

850
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,210
I'm Lin Zhaosheng.

851
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,340
Didn't you ask me just now?

852
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:29,930
What does 25 times 25

853
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:30,540
equal?

854
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,420
625.

855
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,380
What about multiplying 5 more?

856
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,740
3,125.

857
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,620
What is the square number

858
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,220
of 3,125?

859
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:38,440
I don't know.

860
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,260
It's

861
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:40,240
9,765,625.

862
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,650
You can't baffle me with that.

863
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,650
Five minutes ago,

864
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,550
I told you to remember

865
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,540
the name of three kinds of food made of flour.

866
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,530
Do you remember?

867
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,050
What food?

868
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:52,120
Steamed buns, sliced noodles and spring rolls.

869
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:53,560
Do you remember?

870
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:56,170
I don't like food made of flour.

871
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,030
How old are you?

872
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,520
I'm 20.

873
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,350
My birthday is in next month.

874
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,190
I'll be 21.

875
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:10,060
What year do you think it is now?

876
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,580
What do you mean?

877
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,390
It's not up to me.

878
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:14,510
What year do you think it is?

879
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:16,290
It's 1993.

880
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,310
Director Ma.

881
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,020
How is

882
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,290
my dad now?

883
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,400
His external injury heals well.

884
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,020
But the brain

885
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:31,840
is the most sophisticated organ.

886
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,180
A few years ago,

887
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,200
he had

888
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,470
the early-onset Alzheimer's disease.

889
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,500
In the past six months,

890
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:52,470
his condition

891
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,510
has started to get worse.

892
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:55,850
His head was hit again.

893
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,170
And his brain nerves were damaged again.

894
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,530
There's coagulation in his brain.

895
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,390
You've seen

896
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:02,110
the result of MRI.

897
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:02,690
There are shadows on it.

898
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,090
The result shows

899
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,170
that his P-Tau value is abnormal.

900
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:08,540
He has

901
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,100
cognitive disorder now.

902
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,010
He thinks he is

903
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:12,760
in 1993.

904
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:14,350
It's the time when he was young.

905
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:15,970
Cognitive disorder.

906
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,070
Then why did he faint

907
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:18,790
when he realized

908
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:19,690
he was in his forties

909
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:20,570
after looking in the mirror?

910
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,540
And he looked

911
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,620
so dull

912
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:23,580
after he woke up.

913
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,540
Maybe he realized

914
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,310
he was sick.

915
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,340
But he couldn't accept the fact

916
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:29,550
in his mind.

917
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,740
His brain started

918
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,400
the self-protection mechanism

919
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,830
and closed himself off.

920
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,950
So you couldn't communicate with him.

921
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:39,940
After resting for a while,

922
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,200
he will get better.

923
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,070
But the cognitive disorder still exists.

924
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,970
Is there any way to cure it?

925
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:53,830
The hope is slim.

926
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,680
Maybe...

927
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:01,590
Dad.

928
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,320
Dad.

929
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,230
I've never seen a computer.

930
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,100
I've never seen the network system.

931
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,040
It's not fake.

932
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,850
It can't be fake.

933
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,060
This...

934
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,140
So...

935
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:26,980
So you are my daughter?

936
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,260
I...

937
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,630
I'm old.

938
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:34,670
It's not 1993 now.

939
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,840
Dad, you're sick.

940
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,440
There's something wrong with my brain.

941
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,100
Am I right?

942
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:54,630
Lin.

943
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:56,770
Calm down.

944
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,480
Your current situation

945
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:00,320
is only temporary.

946
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,060
Lin Zhaoxi.

947
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:06,910
Lin Zhaoxi is your name, right?

948
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,800
Yes, you remember me.

949
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:11,650
Are you really my daughter?

950
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,020
Yes, "Zhaoxi" means to race against time.

951
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,060
Then...

952
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,120
What about your mother?

953
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,780
Is my marriage happy?

954
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:29,430
You're not married.

955
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,580
My mother died

956
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,640
while giving birth to me.

957
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:43,050
So, I'm an accountant.

958
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:48,470
Say something.

959
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:51,940
Say something.

960
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,560
Say something.

961
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:00,600
Yes.
