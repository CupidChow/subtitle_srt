4
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,750
I used to change jobs a lot.

5
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,270
Let me help you move your stuff.

6
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,140
What stuff?

7
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,680
I moved them all last night.

8
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:48,350
I was just kidding.

9
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,380
Men's words can not be trusted.

10
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:56,830
You've improved.

11
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,270
The colleagues of the Education Bureau

12
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,180
has arranged some activities

13
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,420
to improve the comprehensive ability of students.

14
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,170
It includes experience farming, physical games,

15
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,169
camping and so on.

16
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,400
Yesterday, the staff in the park

17
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:11,070
asked us

18
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,140
when we are going to start.

19
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:13,840
We have less than a month

20
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,150
to prepare for the competition.

21
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,060
We don't have time for this.

22
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,490
Cancel it.

23
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,470
But the Bureau has arranged

24
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,170
newspaper reports.

25
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,200
We also need some pictures of

26
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,190
extracurricular activities.

27
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,780
And this project

28
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,550
is part of

29
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:29,010
of our city's quality education project.

30
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:30,829
Come in.

31
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,630
Sir, I...

32
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,190
Chen Chengcheng?

33
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,570
Where did you go?

34
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:53,450
Take a guess.

35
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:54,930
Don't smile like that.

36
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,140
My back is cold.

37
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,500
Lin is here.

38
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,470
Really?

39
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,810
Master is here to see us?

40
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,280
Not only that,

41
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,270
he also sneaked into

42
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,330
the staff team here.

43
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,900
Then he can

44
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,090
teach us

45
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,080
like what we did in the Youth Palace.

46
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,030
I think so too.

47
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,640
After class,

48
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,770
I'll take you guys to meet him.

49
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:16,710
Mr. Zhang is here.

50
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,200
Just now,

51
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,310
a violent incident happened

52
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,740
in our training camp.

53
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,110
I've been encouraging you

54
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,460
to compete with each other,

55
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,660
but you are not allowed to fight each other.

56
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,170
Lin Zhaoxi, stand up.

57
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,270
I...

58
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,040
Stand up.

59
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,780
Come here.

60
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,220
What did I do?

61
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:57,820
Apologize to Chen Chengcheng.

62
00:03:58,329 --> 00:03:59,740
Why should I apologize to him?

63
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,740
So you just

64
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,740
don't feel guilty

65
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,430
after hitting him, huh?

66
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,080
I hit him?

67
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,820
Why should I hit him?

68
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,550
Leave aside the fact that I'm only a girl,

69
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,180
where did this happen?

70
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,740
And when?

71
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,290
Chen Chengcheng.

72
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,410
Repeat what you said

73
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,230
in the meeting room.

74
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,970
I...

75
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,450
No matter what happens,

76
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,150
just tell me the truth.

77
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,180
I'll handle it.

78
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,450
I...

79
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,980
Sir, I remember now.

80
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,070
Maybe I bumped into him

81
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,480
when I was running.

82
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:51,870
Why didn't you help him get up

83
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,810
when you bumped into someone?

84
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,600
I'll be more careful next time.

85
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,200
Your behavior

86
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,820
has violated

87
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,180
the discipline of the camp.

88
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,580
Do you think there will be a next time?

89
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,260
Sir,

90
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:03,570
I got it wrong.

91
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,980
Lin Zhaoxi didn't hit me.

92
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,850
I accidentally fell down.

93
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,020
Don't be afraid.

94
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,420
Just tell us the truth.

95
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,340
I did it myself.

96
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,980
So you lied

97
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,780
in the meeting room?

98
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,690
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,830
I got it wrong.

100
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,360
Sir, this is obviously a misunderstanding.

101
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,659
There's no need to blame her.

102
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,580
Lin Zhaoxi won't

103
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,510
bully her classmates.

104
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,450
Since Chen Chengcheng didn't lie,

105
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:45,830
then it's Lin Zhaoxi.

106
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,220
I don't care what is the purpose of your lies,

107
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,409
you should be punished.

108
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,500
Pei Zhi,

109
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,810
now you just stand up

110
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,920
and speak?

111
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,470
You're at fault too.

112
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,270
Your team members

113
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,830
will be punished for being implicated by you.

114
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:00,770
This afternoon,

115
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,190
all team members in these two teams

116
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:02,870
are not allowed

117
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,100
to study in the library.

118
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,620
You will follow Mr. Xie

119
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:06,960
to dig sweet potatoes.

120
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,290
Dig the sweet potatoes?

121
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,000
Dig the sweet potatoes?

122
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,980
Lin Zhaoxi, raise the hoe higher.

123
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,190
Higher.

124
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,130
Smile happily.

125
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,380
One, two, three.

126
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,200
Great.

127
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:30,470
Guys, let's dig sweet potatoes.

128
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,870
Let's dig sweet potatoes!

129
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,270
Hurry up!

130
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,260
Here.

131
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:35,970
Be careful.

132
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:36,920
Here.

133
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,360
Here it is.

134
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,250
Look, this one is really big.

135
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,350
Here, Lu Zhihao, Lu Zhihao.

136
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,370
Take this and look at me.

137
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,170
- There are so may sweet potatoes here. - One, two, three.

138
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,800
Look. There must be some here.

139
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,510
When are we going to find Lin?

140
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,700
I wanted to go now,

141
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,540
but I guess I don't have a chance now.

142
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,380
Is this called reforming us through labor?

143
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,100
Reforming us through labor?

144
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,500
Look at them.

145
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,280
They are all having fun.

146
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:07,410
I guess

147
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,860
it's a teaching mission.

148
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,430
Snape found an excuse

149
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,680
to drag us here.

150
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,230
But I already told Lin

151
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:14,950
and I didn't go.

152
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,140
I didn't want him to worry.

153
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,080
I have no choice.

154
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,090
Do you think I should pretend to be sick

155
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,330
and distract Mr. Xie?

156
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,870
You guys can go and find master.

157
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,700
That's a good idea.

158
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,610
But it's a bit...

159
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,370
Wait.

160
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,720
We don't have to do this.

161
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,020
Here.

162
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,670
Look at this.

163
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,460
Take a photo.

164
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,200
Hurry up, Yu Tianjiao.

165
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,860
Look at our results.

166
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,100
OK. OK.

167
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:50,990
It's great.

168
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,150
There's another one here.

169
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,040
Let's dig here.

170
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,010
Here?

171
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,430
This place!

172
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:56,500
Hello.

173
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:57,850
You are...?

174
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,490
I'm...

175
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,890
Are you

176
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,090
Xie Ran from Sanxiang University?

177
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,510
Yes, my name is Xie Ran.

178
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,620
You are a journalist from City Times,

179
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,310
right?

180
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,880
Hello, hello

181
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,770
Hello.

182
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,050
Welcome.

183
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,220
Hello, hello.

184
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,530
I didn't bring my business card.

185
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:19,790
It's okay.

186
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,710
Didn't we agree

187
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,130
that I'll send you the photos online?

188
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:22,860
Why did you

189
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:23,700
come all the way here?

190
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,980
Didn't the leader take it seriously?

191
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:26,990
He asked me

192
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,740
to take a look.

193
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,170
Only in this way can I write

194
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,570
a good story...

195
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,960
the truth about this activity.

196
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,330
You're right.

197
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,630
Take a look.

198
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:36,299
Follow me.

199
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,070
When did master become a reporter?

200
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,169
How could you believe Lin?

201
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,020
Everyone,

202
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,770
the reporter of City Times

203
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:44,590
is here to interview us.

204
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,460
Let's extend our welcome to him.

205
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,340
Guys,

206
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,490
aren't you here to learn Olympic mathematics?

207
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,330
Why are you digging sweet potatoes?

208
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,070
We made a mistake

209
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,120
and we were punished to work.

210
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,740
It's not like that, sir.

211
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,510
It's a project that aims at

212
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,700
expanding their capabilities,

213
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,250
they will experience farming and build their willpower in this process.

214
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,930
Of course. The most glorious thing is working.

215
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:07,850
That's right.

216
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,310
Class,

217
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,210
are you tired now after digging sweet potatoes?

218
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,020
No.

219
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,980
Are you happy?

220
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,310
Yes.

221
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,450
After digging the sweet potatoes,

222
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,070
I'll bake these sweet potatoes with you.

223
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:18,620
OK?

224
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,770
No, we...

225
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,580
Okay?

226
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:21,830
OK!

227
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,250
We don't have this in the project.

228
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,580
I understand.

229
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,000
They've been working all day.

230
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,150
Why don't you let them experience

231
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,150
the fruit of their hard work?

232
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,130
Otherwise they will feel uncomfortable.

233
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,220
In this way, they can feel

234
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,690
the joy of the farmers in the harvest season,

235
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,200
right?

236
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,660
The joy of harvest.

237
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:41,980
There are three here,

238
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,700
and they are linked together.

239
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,410
This is rotten.

240
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,110
It's so big.

241
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,920
Let me do this.

242
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,420
I'm a professional. Come on.

243
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,850
Come on, guys.

244
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:51,380
Here.

245
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,460
Look at the camera.

246
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,620
This little girl.

247
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,550
Hurry up.

248
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,870
Look at the camera.

249
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:56,980
Smile.

250
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,650
Here.

251
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,680
One, two, three.

252
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,760
Cheese.

253
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,540
1/6 minus

254
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,340
7/12,

255
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,500
plus 9/20,

256
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,300
minus 11/30,

257
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,260
plus...

258
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:20,860
What do you want?

259
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,120
Give me the pen. I need to do the exercise.

260
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:26,660
Give it to me.

261
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,690
Give it to me. I need to do the exercise.

262
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:28,730
Give it to me.

263
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,140
Give me the pen. I want to do the exercise.

264
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,150
I want to do exercises.

265
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,140
Give it to me.

266
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,620
Give it to me. I want to do it.

267
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,630
We'll find someone

268
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,420
to lure her out.

269
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:42,820
Then you can

270
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,620
say something to her.

271
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:44,670
When she leaves,

272
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,650
get yourself dirty

273
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,620
and go to Zhang Shuping.

274
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,180
Sir.

275
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,810
Do you understand?

276
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,460
Chen Chengcheng.

277
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,860
He said he didn't lie.

278
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,820
That means you lied.

279
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,780
I don't care

280
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,490
the purpose of your lies,

281
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,020
you need to be punished.

282
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,340
Can Mr. Zhang believe it?

283
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,860
We are the witnesses.

284
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,300
The five of us saw it.

285
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,660
We saw it clearly.

286
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,950
Don't worry.

287
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,300
Lin Zhaoxi.

288
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,740
It's her.

289
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:08,980
Great.

290
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,860
Now we don't even need to lure her out.

291
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,610
Over there. Hurry.

292
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,310
Go in.

293
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,230
Hurry up.

294
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:14,940
Hurry up.

295
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,390
Someone is coming. Hurry up.

296
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:26,450
Mr. Xie.

297
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:27,950
Would you like to have a seat?

298
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,250
Coming.

299
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,200
Mr. Reporter,

300
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,140
when will the sweet potatoes be cooked?

301
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,680
Did you see the fire?

302
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,620
The sweet potatoes will be cooked after the fire goes out.

303
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:38,950
You really know it.

304
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,550
Just some experience.

305
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:45,410
Mr. Xie,

306
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,340
what are they studying?

307
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:49,790
Olympic mathematics.

308
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,610
Don't you know that?

309
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,220
Let me ask you.

310
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,880
What do you want to learn?

311
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,540
I want to learn math.

312
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,550
Do you want to study math

313
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,530
or Olympic mathematics?

314
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,950
What's the difference?

315
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,950
At least, their spellings

316
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,740
are different.

317
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,760
Mr. Reporter,

318
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,110
I can tell that

319
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,260
you have your opinion on Olympic mathematics.

320
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,420
No.

321
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,100
Let me ask you.

322
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,110
In your

323
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,870
understanding,

324
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,890
what is the difference

325
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,810
between math and Olympic mathematics?

326
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,210
Handsome boy, you go first.

327
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,260
Math is a subject.

328
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,370
Olympic mathematics?

329
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,820
I'm not sure.

330
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,370
I know.

331
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,110
Math is simple and Olympic mathematics is difficult.

332
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:39,710
What about you?

333
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,290
If math is a car,

334
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,630
Olympic mathematics will

335
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,420
enable you to drive in a faster and more flexible way.

336
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,540
What about you, Mr. Xie?

337
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:51,390
I think

338
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,770
Pei Zhi was only half right.

339
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,530
Math is a subject.

340
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,880
Olympic mathematics is a competition project

341
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,810
in this subject.

342
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,410
What do you think?

343
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,840
I think Lu Zhihao is right.

344
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:03,780
Certainly

345
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,020
Mr. Xie is right.

346
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,290
Let me ask you a question.

347
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:09,780
Raise your hand if you know.

348
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,980
Who knows

349
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,740
how many sweet potatoes we dug today?

350
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,060
Then raise your hand

351
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,580
if you know how many you got for yourself.

352
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,260
Good.

353
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,430
You're quite sensitive to numbers.

354
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,220
Put your hands down.

355
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,780
But I still want to know

356
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,100
how many sweet potatoes

357
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,780
we got today.

358
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,290
What should we do?

359
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,320
We can add the number of sweet potatoes

360
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,280
of each person.

361
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,000
Smart.

362
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,120
But the problem is

363
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,610
what if we don't know how to add?

364
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,860
If we are primitives,

365
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,250
and addition

366
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,290
hasn't been invented yet.

367
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,010
What should we do?

368
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,870
Actually, in the beginning

369
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,340
in human society.

370
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,160
At that time,

371
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,650
we all wore

372
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,760
tiger skin skirts.

373
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,080
And we will gather around the fire,

374
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:00,900
just like now.

375
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,510
At that time,

376
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,670
there were no addition, subtraction, multiplication or division,

377
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,180
and there were no numbers.

378
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,300
We live on hunting.

379
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,460
We hunted a lot every day.

380
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,180
When we get home,

381
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,500
we don't know

382
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:14,220
how many animals we hunted.

383
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,460
But one day,

384
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,410
I think I should write it down.

385
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,620
Otherwise, what should we do

386
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,510
if Mr. Xie comes to our house

387
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,100
and take them?

388
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,190
When I got home,

389
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,260
I'll draw some lines on the wall,

390
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,940
to record

391
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,230
how many animals I've hunted today.

392
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,820
I got three chickens this day, and four ducks the other day.

393
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,410
But there's another problem after a long time.

394
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,630
Because when I got home,

395
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,290
I found the wall was full of lines.

396
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:38,670
The wall was going to collapse,

397
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,570
so did I.

398
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:40,990
I need this house to get myself married.

399
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,060
How can I live in it now?

400
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,350
This problem

401
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,620
happened in every family

402
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,220
of my tribe.

403
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,750
Everyone

404
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,020
need to start counting.

405
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,500
So,

406
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,020
someone started

407
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,050
to solve this problem creatively.

408
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,710
This

409
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,150
is basically

410
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,580
the process of how numbers are born.

411
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,720
If you're lucky to see

412
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:07,140
the stone board carved by the ancient Babylon,

413
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,110
these Babylons

414
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,040
will use a pen that looks like a triangular prism

415
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:11,750
to carve the words.

416
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,180
It is known as the cuneiform

417
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:13,940
today.

418
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,150
When they

419
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,100
draw one line on the wall, it represents one.

420
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,640
Two lines means two.

421
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,890
And other numbers are similar.

422
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,700
When you draw to ten,

423
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,870
a new math symbol

424
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,740
is born.

425
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,190
Like this.

426
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,430
This is a great leap of human civilization.

427
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,410
Calculating with symbols

428
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,980
represents the birth of the great algorithm.

429
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,430
[The birth of the great algorithm]

430
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,560
OK.

431
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,690
Olympic mathematics, in my opinion,

432
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,460
is a method that enables you

433
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,970
to put aside

434
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,310
the advanced tools

435
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,260
when facing a difficult problem,

436
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,560
instead you should solve it

437
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,270
with innovative thought,

438
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,940
just like previous scholars.

439
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,600
It's like a person

440
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,750
is trying to fight the evil dragon

441
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,960
with a small wood stick.

442
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,940
Each time you solve a problem with it,

443
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,170
it's a marvelous achievement.

444
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,590
Maybe one day,

445
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,790
when you made some accomplishment

446
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,900
in math,

447
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,810
you'll meet your river.

448
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,310
At that time,

449
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,410
you need to pick up the axe

450
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,770
and build a bridge

451
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,240
of your own,

452
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,660
so that you can cross your own river.

453
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,750
Olympic mathematics

454
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,220
is like cleaning the rust of this axe you need.

455
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,110
Even if you make your axe pretty sharp,

456
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,260
the bridge may not be built well.

457
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,020
But a sharp axe

458
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:36,900
is helpful anyway.

459
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,860
But please remember,

460
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,380
sharpening this axe and building your bridge

461
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,080
are not all about math.

462
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,320
If you focus on it too much, you will lose

463
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,540
the happiness of learning math.

464
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,360
After all, most people

465
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,170
who study math...

466
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,300
Is the sweet potato ready?

467
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:53,700
Okay.

468
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:54,990
I'll go take a look.

469
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,750
Here, have some sweet potatoes.

470
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,700
Have some sweet potatoes.

471
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:11,869
Be careful.

472
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:12,750
Here you are.

473
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:13,890
- Thanks a lot, thanks a lot. - My pleasure.

474
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,630
Let's share them.

475
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,550
This half is for you.

476
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:24,020
Thank you.

477
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,950
Here, more for you.

478
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:25,660
That will do.

479
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,380
Thanks, that will do.

480
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:26,900
That will do?

481
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,460
Here.

482
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:28,480
You're welcome.

483
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:29,980
Xiaotian, I'll give you some more.

484
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,580
Smells good.

485
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,250
Have some of this.

486
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:32,660
Thank you.

487
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:33,270
It's hot.

488
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,200
Thank you.

489
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:42,860
Is it well cooked?

490
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,510
Yes.

491
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,100
Is it because you're bored?

492
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,380
You didn't finish what you just said.

493
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,190
Mathematicians study math

494
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:55,940
because they're bored.

495
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:58,660
Right?

496
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,490
You're not a reporter.

497
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,380
Who are you?

498
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,600
I'm a parent.

499
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,380
Parent?

500
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,500
Which student's parent?

501
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,490
My surname is Lin.

502
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,980
You're Lin Zhaoxi's father?

503
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,590
I'm her master,

504
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,710
at least for now.

505
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,200
It smells so good.

506
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:46,870
So sweet.

507
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,240
This sweet potato is so...

508
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,650
Guys, I'm leaving.

509
00:18:59,010 --> 00:18:59,490
Everyone,

510
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,840
say goodbye to Mr. Journalist.

511
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,740
Goodbye, sir.

512
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:02,540
Goodbye, Mr. journalist.

513
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:03,410
Bye.

514
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,330
He said

515
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,650
this pain is nothing.

516
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,970
Wipe your tears. Don't be afraid.

517
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:15,350
At least we still have dreams.

518
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,660
He said...

519
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,940
Guys, let's sing a song

520
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,500
and go back while singing?

521
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,730
OK. OK.

522
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,770
Let's sing...

523
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,640
Lin Zhaoxi, can you think of a song and lead us singing?

524
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,110
I know a song.

525
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,550
I'll sing.

526
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,170
Please sing along.

527
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:35,940
OK.

528
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,260
One, two, three.

529
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,340
I'm riding my little motorbike, and I really love it.

530
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,980
I'm riding my little motorbike, and I really love it.

531
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:49,030
It never gets stuck in traffic.

532
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,820
It never gets stuck in traffic.

533
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,810
I'm riding my little motorbike, and I really love it.

534
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,020
I'm riding my little motorbike, and I really love it.

535
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,320
What are you doing?

536
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,870
Why did you kick Chen Chengcheng out?

537
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,460
He wants to leave.

538
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,640
It's none of my business.

539
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,780
You asked Chen Chengcheng to frame me.

540
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,120
He changed his mind,

541
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,640
so you kicked him out,

542
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,340
right?

543
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,500
Why are you asking me?

544
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:21,800
Are you a teacher

545
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,890
or a police officer?

546
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,290
I'm going to tell Mr. Zhang.

547
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,150
Go ahead.

548
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,200
Who can prove what you said?

549
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,500
Wait and see.

550
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,310
The society will teach you how to be a human.

551
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,500
I'll wait.

552
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:37,640
But you will leave

553
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,340
after the next exam.

554
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,200
I'm afraid you won't see me in the future,

555
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,510
and you won't see that day either.

556
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,610
Brat.

557
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:52,980
What?

558
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,100
He didn't admit it and provoked me.

559
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,500
He said we were going to leave here.

560
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,820
Brat.

561
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,940
Don't mind them.

562
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,200
We'll try our best.

563
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,220
The result is not that important.

564
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,070
Come with me

565
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:06,840
to meet someone.

566
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,240
He will definitely help us

567
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:09,910
pass the exam.

568
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,420
Who is that? Sounds amazing.

569
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,400
You all know him.

570
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:21,990
This is the book list.

571
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:22,620
And this is

572
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,940
the outline I made for everyone.

573
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,850
But the books are in the library.

574
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,060
You have chosen good books.

575
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:29,670
But I still have to

576
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,640
go to the library and take a look.

577
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:31,830
Let's discuss

578
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,940
when the class begins.

579
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:34,750
Don't let Mr. Zhang know

580
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,420
that we have master.

581
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,100
We will be noticed

582
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:39,560
since there are 12 of us.

583
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,920
It's better to have classes at night.

584
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,260
But we don't have sufficient time at night.

585
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,740
And we have to return to the dormitory before ten o'clock.

586
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,660
We'll sneak out

587
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,710
after the teacher left,

588
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,160
and gather outside

589
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,860
and then go to the mailroom.

590
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,820
The class will end at

591
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,120
two o'clock.

592
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,420
Then go back to sleep.

593
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,020
Two o'clock? How can I sleep?

594
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,540
We won't get enough sleep in this case.

595
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:04,840
Guys,

596
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,420
the training camp will be

597
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,590
our memory.

598
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,380
Do you want to end it with failure

599
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
or do you want to win

600
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,700
with sweat?

601
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,840
Lin, don't laugh.

602
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm serious.

603
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,820
Usually, we won't find the meaning

604
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,040
of something

605
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,520
until we really devote ourselves to it.

606
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,260
If we keep that "I don't care" attitude,

607
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:26,980
and tell ourselves that nothing is going to

608
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,000
make a difference, no matter what we do,

609
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,270
maybe we will regret

610
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:30,980
when we grow up.

611
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,110
I have experience regret,

612
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,050
I don't want to feel it again.

613
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,260
Auntie,

614
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,950
can you get me a takeaway?

615
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,000
Please give me the fried pork with garlic,

616
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:52,950
fried eggs with tomatoes,

617
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,220
and braised chicken wings.

618
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,100
The food here is good.

619
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,430
It's not as good as mine.

620
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:04,610
You can cook meals?

621
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,370
Of course.

622
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,780
Great.

623
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,820
Your hands can earn you a large amount of betrothal gifts.

624
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,060
How can you calculate like that?

625
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,020
Don't be that snobbish.

626
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:16,800
You're not my dad.

627
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,820
My betrothal gift is not your business.

628
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,880
Just kidding.

629
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:24,740
Have a chicken wing.

630
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,620
You eat it.

631
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:34,830
I don't like this part of the chicken wing,

632
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,670
I like the tip of the wings, it's delicious.

633
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:40,590
No way.

634
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,190
Back in the Youth's Palace,

635
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,820
I said you liked the tip of wings,

636
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,300
you said who will eat the tip of the wings if you can have the middle part of the chicken wings.

637
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,920
So you lied to me.

638
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,500
Hurry up and eat your meal.

639
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,100
Look at you, how skinny you are.

640
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,060
Let me tell you.

641
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:55,380
you will feel regretful

642
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,340
when you find yourself short in the future.

643
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:58,640
Dad.

644
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,710
What are you laughing at?

645
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,930
Thinking about your prank?

646
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:18,500
No.

647
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,160
I think Pei Zhi is right.

648
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,720
You didn't change.

649
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:23,900
You've evolved!

650
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,750
MANMON Evolution!

651
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,300
I wonder what are you thinking

652
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,010
all day long?

653
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:34,700
Just eat your meals!

654
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:36,990
MANMON Evolution...

655
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:44,710
[The Chicken-and rabbits Problem]

656
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,120
This question.

657
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,540
Some chickens and rabbits share a cage.

658
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,140
There are

659
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,870
have 12 heads.

660
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,830
34 legs.

661
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,140
Please find out

662
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,630
how many chickens and rabbits are there.

663
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,570
It's simple, right?

664
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,040
It's just a linear equation with two unknowns, right?

665
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,030
But now,

666
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,320
I want you not to use

667
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,480
linear equation in two unknowns.

668
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,460
How to solve it?

669
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,270
Look.

670
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,180
Let's assume

671
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,030
we removed

672
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:14,030
half of all the animals' legs.

673
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,500
Therefore, half of 34 equals to 17.

674
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,820
Now,

675
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,700
the amount of the head of chickens

676
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,820
equals to the amount of their legs.

677
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,750
If we subtract the amount of all their legs, 17,

678
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,680
from the amount of all their heads,12,

679
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,360
it means

680
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,350
we removed

681
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,420
another leg of them.

682
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:34,780
Now the chicken has no legs,

683
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:35,310
right?

684
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,420
The rabbit has one leg left.

685
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,960
17 minus 12 equals 5.

686
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:42,230
So there are five rabbits.

687
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,580
Seven chickens.

688
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,770
It can be solved like this?

689
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,990
It's quite interesting.

690
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,950
Come on, let's make a contrast.

691
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,040
I'll write down the questions.

692
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,070
Now, let's

693
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,810
suppose there is a turtle who has

694
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,650
with three legs and two eyes.

695
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:00,110
♫Dappled light and shadow♫

696
00:26:58,770 --> 00:26:59,530
So in the future,

697
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,360
when it comes to

698
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:01,750
usually we can solve it with

699
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:02,850
these three methods.

700
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,260
the lift feet method, the packing method,

701
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,290
♫Flowing time♫

702
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:05,880
and hypothesis.

703
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,020
Understand?

704
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,300
Yes.

705
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:09,880
Next question.

706
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:11,550
Two places in the east and west,

707
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:20,990
♫Don't hesitate, or it will slip through your finger♫

708

they are 5,400 meters away from each other.

709
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,180
Now two person depart from

710
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,000
these two places at the same time...

711
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:26,160
♫Just live in the moment♫

712

♫When you look at the two sides of the world♫

717
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,340
Boss, have you printed it?

718
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:04,930
Coming.

719
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,530
One copy is ready.

720
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:14,780
♫You will make everything come true with your hand when you reach for you dream♫

721
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,400
Okay, thank you.

722
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,190
We still need one more.

723
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,080
You asked me

724
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,800
why should we study prime number,

725
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,330
♫Dappled light and shadow♫

726
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:18,860
right?

727
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:22,860
♫We should find the real incentive in our heart♫

728
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,880
The mathematicians have studied them

729
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,780
for over 2,000 years.

730
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,170
They studied the distribution pattern of prime numbers,

731
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,560
♫Time flowing♫

732
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,340
and calculated the amount of prime numbers

733
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,910
♫We should take back the light that were taken away from us♫

734
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,900
in a certain range.

735
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,380
They worked with great diligence, and spent their lifetime on it.

736
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,650
♫Don't feel confused♫

737
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,580
Does it work?

♫Do not repeat the mistakes of failure♫

739
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:34,610
It looks meaningless,

740
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,020
But it's not.

741
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,590
Because today...

742
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,130
Hold on. Take it.

743
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,620
Sit straight.

744
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,250
Look at this question.

745
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:57,910
Is it familiar?

746
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,910
How long will it take?

747
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,320
I'm sure it'll be soon.

748
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,060
What about you?

749
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:03,760
Up to today,

750
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,130
three of you quitted voluntarily.

751
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,340
One team was cancelled.

752
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,930
Therefore,

753
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:11,750
the ten teams here,

754
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,770
half of you will leave after the exam.

755
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,300
Everyone,

756
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,280
our daily accumulation

757
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,710
is to show our current performance.

758
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,340
Don't be nervous

759
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,140
during the exam.

760
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:25,270
Relax.

761
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:26,220
That's how you can show your real level.

762
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,180
The seat of this exam will be mixed.

763
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:31,350
Please come to Mr. Xie

764
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,060
to get your seat number

765
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,810
and sit in your corresponding position.

766
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,550
Come on. Come on.

767
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,590
Among the four-sided ABCD,

768
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,630
AB=BC=CD

769
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:22,590
∠C=70°.

770
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,940
∠BCD=170°.

771
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,940
Please find out the size

772
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,870
of ∠BAD?

773
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,870
I should know this question.

774
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,700
What's going on?

775
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,140
There are two person Xand Y,

776
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,640
they set off at the same time

777
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:34,580
from two places, A and B,

778
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:35,340
and head towards each other.

779
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,270
They meet each other somewhere in 20 minutes.

780
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,550
If X can walk 15 additional meters

781
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,540
per minute,

782
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,540
how many

783
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,810
positive integer are there

784
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,630
that satisfy

785
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,850
15 (x-2)<7x+ 4/5?

786
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,090
Easy.

787
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:49,740
First of all,

788
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,860
solve the ninety-nine point formation.

789
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,140
The amount of points in the 99th floor is

790
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,720
6*99=594.

791
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,880
Then, with the formula,

792
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:55,410
we can come up with

793
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,300
the total amount of points in this ninety-ninety-nine point formation,

794
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:57,260
which is...

795
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,190
If Lin Zhaoxi returns to Strawberry World,

796
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,760
can I meet her in the future?

797
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,370
What are you doing?

798
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,450
Do you have fried peanuts?

799
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:30,800
No.

800
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:32,550
Can you cook something for me?

801
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,820
Do you think this is a restaurant?

802
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,810
I'll prepare the materials.

803
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:42,780
Please help me.

804
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,420
Come and pick up them in this afternoon.

805
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:49,160
Okay.

806
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:04,770
Over there.

807
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,300
How is it?

808
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,730
Are you okay?

809
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,740
I can't throw up.

810
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:16,050
I feel disgusting.

811
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,100
In order to get your dad

812
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,120
buy you a computer,

813
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:20,490
you worked so hard.

814
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,520
It's not about the computer.

815
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,180
Then what is it?

816
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,010
I want to do my best.

817
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,660
I don't want to regret in the future.

818
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,540
Didn't you say that?

819
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,160
Now I'll announce

00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,320
Zheng Bingqing is 70.

857
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,050
Zou Wenchao, 65.

858
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,540
78 for the song.

859
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,690
The average score is 78.2.

860
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,420
Lin Zhaoxi! Lin Zhaoxi! Lin Zhaoxi!

861
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,100
Lin Zhaoxi! Lin Zhaoxi!

862
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:09,699
Lin Zhaoxi! Lin Zhaoxi!

863
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,590
The last group left is,

864
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:13,350
the fifth place,

865
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,770
team of Lin Zhaoxi.

866
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,260
Lin Zhaoxi, 98.

867
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:23,429
Lu Zhihao, 82.

868
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,260
Shao Mingchen 67.

869
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,610
Yao Xiaotian 70.

870
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,860
Yu Tianjiao is 72.

871
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,150
Wang Lu 76.

872
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,540
The average is 77.5.

873
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:38,070
The rest of you,

874
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,199
whose names are not mentioned,

875
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,190
please leave here

876
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:43,190
this afternoon.

877
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,389
See you.

878
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:31,940
Half a month ago,

879
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,340
80 people entered this camp.

880
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,140
After selection,

881
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,250
only

882
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:37,940
27 people are standing here.

883
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:39,840
You are the elites.

884
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,260
You should applaud for yourselves.

885
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:54,360
Don't let yourself slack off..

886
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:56,300
Hang on there.

887
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,040
You go first.

888
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,780
I'll talk to Hua Juan alone.

889
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:05,700
OK.

890
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:07,660
Let's go.

891
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,500
What's wrong?

892
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,100
Snape said

893
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,500
only three groups can get in the competition.

894
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,030
But in the photo,

895
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,410
There are four groups.

896
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:24,530
It's OK.

897
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,900
We've tried our best

898
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,250
to come here.

899
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:30,590
We worked together

900
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,890
and chased the same target.

901
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,330
Let's leave the rest to God.

902
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:37,350
After all, the things about that photo

903
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,410
is just our guessing.

904
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,740
We still have time.

905
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:45,540
Maybe he changed his mind.

906
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,490
Maybe there are other changes.

907
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,180
Stop worrying.

908
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,270
You almost got crushed before.

909
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,020
Just relax.

910
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,630
As a star,

911
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,780
I spend my time wandering around the parallel universe with you.

912
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,000
That is great enough.

913
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,830
I haven't heard you say

914
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,140
you're a star for a long while.

915
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,760
So I should remind you,

916
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:11,990
as a fan,

917
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,350
you have to know your place.

918
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,170
It is your fans that gave you all you have,

919
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:16,950
okay?

920
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,270
Let's go, mom.

921
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:20,820
Go to hell!

922
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,470
I don't have a naughty son like you.

923
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,740
How am I naughty?

924
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,650
Aren't you naughty?

925
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:26,710
No.

926
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,540
Hurry up.

927
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:32,860
Stop running.

928
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,380
I got the lowest score this time.

929
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,090
I dragged you down.

930
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,780
Don't think like that.

931
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:44,760
We are all human.

932
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:46,110
We only have two legs.

933
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:46,900
Left leg and right leg.

934
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,100
They are all here, so you are not dragging us behind.

935
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,750
You can only drag the legs of pigs.

936
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:50,970
Everyone has made progress.

937
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,150
Don't be discouraged.

938
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,500
Besides, Master is here.

939
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,330
We're not afraid of the exam.

940
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,180
You're right.

941
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,890
I'm sure Snape didn't expect that

942
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,330
we already have

943
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,330
a teacher of our own.

944
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,620
Long live, Lin!

945
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:04,660
We haven't thanked Master yet.

946
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,160
It's not convenient during the day.

947
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:08,950
How about we prepare a surprise

948
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,900
for Master tonight?

949
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:10,660
Sure.

950
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,500
What surprise?

951
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,420
How about prepare the breakdancing

952
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:13,800
for Master?

953
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:15,950
What are you dancing?

954
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:16,530
So ugly.

955
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,200
I'm the best dancer.

956
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:24,090
Pei Zhi's group is here, that's awful enough.

957
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:25,800
Now the team of

958
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,820
also stayed.

959
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,230
This is so annoying.

960
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,470
This time, Lu Zhihao

961
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,900
got 82 points.

962
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,500
Look at him.

963
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,100
It seems he got full marks.

964
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,960
Wang Feng, what's wrong with you?

965
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,620
Your score is not as high as Lu Zhihao's.

966
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,830
Sorry, Liang.

967
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,700
I failed this exam.

968
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:43,270
But I have an important information

969
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:43,990
to report to you.

970
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,140
I woke up in the middle of the night before yesterday

971
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,230
I saw Zou Benchao

972
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,980
from Lin Zhaoxi's group

973
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,420
came out of the toilet.

974
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,010
I didn't think much at first.

975
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,310
When I went back to my room and looked at the watch,

976
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,910
I realized it's already two o'clock in the morning.

977
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:57,460
The more I think about it, the weirder it is.

978
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,650
What's wrong with going to the toilet?

979
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,440
He was wearing clothes, pants,

980
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,480
and sneakers.

981
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,540
He must have just come back from outside.

982
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,420
Then tell me,

983
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:08,730
where did he go at 2 a.m.

984
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,440
No matter where he went,

985
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,520
it has nothing to do with your failure in the exam.

986
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:12,630
Don't change the topic.

987
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,020
Let's talk about scores.

988
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,580
Liang,

989
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,180
I just heard something.

990
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,540
It seems that Lin Zhaoxi and Pei Zhi

991
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,780
have a master.

992
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,170
Master?

993
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,390
Interesting.

994
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:50,890
The performance of

995
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,230
Lin Zhaoxi's and Pei Zhi's group

996
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,540
is beyond my expectation.

997
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,100
Not mention

998
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:56,940
Pei Zhi and Lin Zhaoxi.

999
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:57,840
It's rare that

1000
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,160
everyone is improving.

1001
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:02,920
Mr. Zhang, you even praised them.

1002
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:03,890
I thought

1003
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:04,640
you don't like them.

1004
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,940
Every teacher likes

1005
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,010
smart students.

1006
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:09,350
But if I didn't

1007
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,340
give them some pressure,

1008
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:11,330
they can't achieve

1009
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,070
their current results.

1010
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:13,530
Yes.

1011
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,660
Sister, where are those peanuts?

1012
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:35,910
Here.

1013
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,140
This

1014
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,830
is against our company's rules.

1015
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:39,830
Understand?

1016
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,160
Good craftsmanship. You really know how to do it.

1017
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,840
Hurry up.

1018
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,330
I'll come again next time.

1019
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,220
Don't come. Just go.

1020
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,120
We're colleagues. I'll come.

1021
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:57,850
Zhaosheng.

1022
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:58,710
Shuping.

1023
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,450
I thought it was you.

1024
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,220
Look.

1025
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,780
Why are you...

1026
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,180
Your child is here?

1027
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,120
What? I don't have a child.

1028
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,370
I'm the guard at the gate.

1029
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,110
You have got a stable job.

1030
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,130
Yes.

1031
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,370
Because of that thing in college,

1032
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:15,350
I didn't get my certificate.

1033
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:17,180
It's hard to find a job.

1034
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:18,370
Just deal with it.

1035
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,570
Are you a cook here?

1036
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:22,100
Well, the Education Bureau

1037
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,110
asked me to come back

1038
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:24,390
to teach the Olympic mathematics class.

1039
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:25,730
I can use this base

1040
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,540
to prepare

1041
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:27,460
for training.

1042
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,230
It's actually good.

1043
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,040
So you are a leader?

1044
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,930
Can you arrange it for me?

1045
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:31,740
I'll be a cook.

1046
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:32,260
I'm just

1047
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,390
a teacher here.

1048
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,870
And I'm not

1049
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,510
in the same system

1050
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:36,670
with the management department.

1051
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,480
Good.

1052
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,080
Let me see

1053
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:39,870
if I can find a chance

1054
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,470
to talk about this.

1055
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,320
OK.

1056
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:42,260
Thank you. That's good.

1057
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,300
I'll get some food.

1058
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:44,130
I'm going to my room.

1059
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,150
Okay.

1060
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:10,770
This is...

1061
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:11,990
This is a surprise

1062
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:12,990
we prepared for you.

1063
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,360
Hua Juan painted the outline.

1064
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,510
Pei Zhi painted the hair.

1065
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:19,370
Lu Zhihao drew the beard.

1066
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,660
I put the eyes on.

1067
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:22,890
I'm not blind.

1068
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,100
Why am I wearing sunglasses?

1069
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,070
I have another surprise for you.

1070
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:28,650
Twist it.

1071
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,420
What's that look?

1072
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,090
Doesn't that look like you?

1073
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,440
Not like me. I'm so cool.

1074
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,460
Try your sunglasses cookies.

1075
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:44,480
By the way,

1076
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,430
Mimi, it's time to eat.

1077
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:51,230
What are you doing?

1078
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,720
A stray cat.

1079
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:57,590
You really decided to adopt it?

1080
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,860
It won't leave.

1081
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,310
What can I do?
