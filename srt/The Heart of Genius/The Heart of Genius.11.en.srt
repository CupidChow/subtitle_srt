Listen to me.

20
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,579
I know there are many rumors

about me recently.

22
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:20,340
Some said that

00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,340
I was in a relationship with a female singer.

24
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,260
Some even said I was secretly married.

25
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,590
I didn't want to clarify anything

26
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,540
because I thought

27
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,100
even if you explain something,

28
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,690
others may not believe you.

29
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,500
But today, I saw that

30

you were here, and

31
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,020
I'm touched.

32
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,300
It was your support that

made me who I am now.

34
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:35,100
So I can keep quiet

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,250
to the public,

36
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,660
but I have the responsibility

37
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,100
to tell you the truth.

I'm an adult.

42

No.

00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:47,090
Although we are classmates, we don't know each other well.

174
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,380
So the only reason you came to me

175
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,440
must be her.

176
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,490
Lin Zhaoxi

177
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,460
won't beat around the bush

178
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,860
or ask someone to come here

179
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,090
to express her feelings.

180
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,480
Ordinary friends

181
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,000
won't come to me

182
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,840
without letting her know it.

183
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,340
Unless you see me as your love rival,

184
00:07:58,409 --> 00:07:59,730
so you want to come and know about me.

185
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,650
Pei is amazing,

186
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,750
but you were wrong from the beginning.

187
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,170
I know you well.

188
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,770
Two days ago,

189
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,100
we were staying in the same room.

190
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,710
If you come here

191
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:18,960
to say this,

192
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:19,980
you should go.

193
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:21,780
Don't be angry.

194
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:23,130
I

195
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,510
always talk nonsense when I'm excited.

196
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,180
Now that we have had a showdown from the beginning,

197
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,420
I'll be frank.

198
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,880
I'm here to ask you

199
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,659
what you think of Lin Zhaoxi.

200
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,100
If you don't

201
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:34,980
like her,

202
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,460
I hope you can be more decisive

203
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,500
and stop her from imagining.

204
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,860
It's between me and her.

205
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,780
It's none of your business.

206
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,580
Pei Zhi,

207
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,610
I'm not here

208
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,820
to trouble you.

209
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,500
Lin Zhaoxi was unhappy

210
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,560
before.

211
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:55,460
She has finally

212
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,130
found the direction of her life now.

213
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,620
But she encountered a lot of things

214
00:08:59,180 --> 00:08:59,980
and she needs to study for postgraduate entrance examination.

215
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,850
Uncle Lin is seriously ill

216
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,940
and you suddenly showed up.

217
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,860
I don't want her

218
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,010
to waste her time

219
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,000
on these meaningless things.

220
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,620
Is Master seriously ill?

221
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,390
The result is almost the same as that of the last time.

222
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,160
I think it's a good thing.

223
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,770
At least it didn't get worse.

224
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,940
I lie to him like this.

225
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,830
Will it affect him and

226
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:26,770
make him more serious?

227
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,340
To be honest,

228
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,890
it's hard to predict.

229
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,980
Many patients with cognitive disorders

230
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,170
don't recognize their family.

231
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,500
I've seen patients who considered their daughters

232
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,600
as their sisters.

233
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:40,520
Some thought

234
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,580
their sons who were in their 40s

235
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:42,730
were still in primary school.

236
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,890
Some even

237
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,960
experienced their whole lives within one day.

238
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,180
They were girls in the morning,

239
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,230
mothers at noon,

240
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,530
and grandmothers at night.

241
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,500
The patients are weird.

242
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:55,650
[Doctor's Working System]

243
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,770
There are all kinds of things.

244
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,140
Most families

245
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,540
chose to coax them.

246
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,340
You can't

247
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,640
act against them.

248
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,780
So this is not cheating.

249
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,580
Don't feel pressured.

250
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,460
This is

251
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,670
what it is.

252
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,820
Alzheimer's disease.

253
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,060
What did you say?

254
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:24,850
Thank you

255
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,780
for telling me this.

256
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,130
You don't need to thank me.

257
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,160
If you want to,

258
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,550
go and see Uncle Lin.

259
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,600
If you have anything to say,

260
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,870
make it clear to Lin Zhaoxi.

261
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,250
A man

262
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,380
waits for a girl to come to you.

263
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,140
It's not appropriate.

264
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,360
You actually encouraged me to find her.

265
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,520
I thought you big stars

266
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,630
would take out a card,

267
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,890
throw it on the table

268
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,940
and let me disappear forever

269
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,580
like those in dramas.

270
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,310
In this card,

271
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,140
there is 1.45 million and

272
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,250
3,524 yuan.

273
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,910
We can talk if it's not enough.

274
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,020
Do you want it?

275
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,140
Pei Zhi.

276
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:12,840
Pei Zhi.

277
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,490
Mom.

278
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,370
Auntie,

279
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,300
you're still so young.

280
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,020
Have a seat.

281
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,730
Who are you?

282
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,020
I'm Pei Zhi's classmate.

283
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,340
I've seen you before.

284
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,000
Where have I seen you?

285
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,590
I am an actor.

286
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,650
My name is Ji Jiang.

287
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,870
Are you a star?

288
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,190
No,

289
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,140
I am just an ordinary person.

290
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,580
Auntie, have a seat.

291
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,300
I have something to do.

292
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,250
I have to go back.

293
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,690
Aren't you going to play for a while?

294
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,510
No, no.

295
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,360
You young people should communicate more.

296
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,520
Come to my house more often.

297
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,140
Sure.

298
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,030
Goodbye, aunt.

299
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:47,820
Bye.

300
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,700
Wait.

301
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,410
Don't forget your stuff.

302
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,240
Mom, let me see him off.

303
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:58,830
See you.

304
00:11:59,010 --> 00:11:59,580
Goodbye, aunt.

305
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:00,610
Bye. Bye.

306
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,060
Okay, then you answer this question.

307
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,220
The equivalent proposition.

308
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,630
Connect the acyclic graph.

309
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,750
I'm going to the toilet.

310
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,580
Remember,

311
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,780
G is connected and M equals N-1.

312
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,780
Why are you laughing?

313
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:20,780
Well,

314
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,660
your head was pretty big when you were a kid.

315
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,620
Is this head big?

316
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:24,420
Isn't it big?

317
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,140
Isn't it good to have a big head?

318
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,730
It's good. It's cute.

319
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,340
Where are your childhood photos?

320
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,100
What do you want to do?

321
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,310
Didn't we agree with it?

322
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:37,690
What did we agree with?

323
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:38,680
Well...

324
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,910
Do you want to play rogue?

325
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,660
Thats because you're easy to fool.

326
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,060
Give me the photo.

327
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,240
You are a genius.

328
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,210
You have such a smart brain,

329
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,030
but you can do nothing.

330
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,960
You broke your promise.

331
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,840
You do the exercise.

332
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,250
No one breaks his words like you.

333
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,740
Hurry up and write.

334
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,780
Do you understand what my master has said?

335
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:09,780
It's none of your business.

336
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,390
We just estimate

337
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,760
how many stairs there are.

338
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,250
Let's see who's right. Do you want to bet?

339
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,530
Stop looking. Do you want to bet?

340
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:23,970
What do you bet on?

341
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,020
If I win,

342
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,380
buy me an ice cream.

343
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,620

there are two flights of three stairs.

The rest are nine steps.

You're right.

But the last flight

380

is obviously one step less.

381
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,950
So it must be 50.

00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,660
At least, we still have dreams.

686
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:53,660
He said that the...

687
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,210
Have you finished washing?

688
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,740
Has Pei Zhi gone back?

689
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:58,810
Yes.

690
00:29:59,140 --> 00:29:59,820
Will he come?

691
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,500
I don't know.

692
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,130
Call him.

693
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,900
Tell him to come tomorrow.

694
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,480
I won't call him.

695
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,970
I am a supervisor, right?

696
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,540
I need to act like a supervisor.

697
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,130
Supervisor?

698
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,270
I'm his

699
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,240
postgraduate teacher, right?

700
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,300
Is he a Ph.D.？

701
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,220
I'm a Ph.D. supervisor.

702
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,930
Sit down and talk about it.

703
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,480
Then I...

704
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,200
I should be a professor.

705
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,140
I used to think that

706
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,570
after I graduated,

707
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,940
I would be a teacher in a university.

708
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,000
I will educate people

709
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,160
while doing research.

710
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,460
Do you have my thesis?

711
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,100
Let me have a look.

712
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,020
Why do you want to see that?

713
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,930
Why can't I see that?

714
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,420
Aren't you going back?

715
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,100
You... I got it.

716
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,130
Do you want to see

717
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,230
the future research results

718
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:48,770
and take them back to tell others that you wrote it yourself?

719
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,340
No, I...

720
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,280
What?

721
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,960
Isn't that plagiarism?

722
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:53,660
Really?

723
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,340
Yes.

724
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,460
Then you promise me.

725
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:56,140
Don't ask

726
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,640
questions related to math research.

727
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,870
And don't search the Internet.

728
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,250
Otherwise, I will definitely

729
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,340
think badly of you.

730
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,900
I don't want my dad

731
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,110
to succeed by cheating.

732
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,300
No.

733
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:09,180
Isn't this a good time now?

734
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,170
I'll watch more dramas.

735
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,010
It is good.

736
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,100
You are good at

737
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:14,940
using cyber language.

738
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,100
I surf the Internet every day. I am a genius.

739
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,660
Genius.

740
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:35,050
He has a charmed life. He was not seriously hurt.

741
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,000
He was sent to the hospital.

742
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,500
He reeked of alcohol.

743
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,040
He must have drunk a lot.

744
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,570
Describe what has happened

745
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,180
just now briefly.

746
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,230
I'm recording it.

747
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,080
I will file it.

748
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:04,700
Good morning.

749
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,580
Why are you here?

750
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,900
I'm here to visit Lin.

751
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,720
Come in, please.

752
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,150
Stop it.

753
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:38,780
Good morning.

754
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,460
Ji.

755
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:44,940
You scared me.

756
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,620
Get up.

757
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,140
I brought you a lobster to make you more healthy.

758
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:47,420
Hurry up.

759
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,260
You scared me.

760
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,220
Get up. Hurry up.

761
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,140
I will get up.

762
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,510
Get up.

763
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,900
I'll wash my face. I will get up.

764
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,440
It's so big.

765
00:32:59,470 --> 00:32:59,990
Right?

766
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,360
It's good for your health.

767
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:04,970
You're up.

768
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:05,910
You're awake.

769
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:09,910
Where did you get the lobster?

770
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:10,700
I bought it.

771
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:11,930
I asked the boss

772
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,080
to get me the biggest one.

773
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,030
Put it back.

774
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:15,940
It's scary.

775
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,860
How is Lin doing these days?

776
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,670
I was about to tell you.

777
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,760
Get our story straight. Don't expose it.

778
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,450
He thinks

779
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,490
he is a math professor

780
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,710
in Sanwei University,

781
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:31,990
and he is on his vacation.

782
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,830
Why did you lie about this?

783
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:38,310
I told you that

784
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,070
the nature of time travel

785
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:39,910
is similar.

786
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,870
I'm afraid he can't accept the reality.

787
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:42,890
What if he breaks down again?

788
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,990
Can you hide this from him?

789
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,530
What if he wants to work?

790
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,250
I don't know.

791
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:54,180
But it should be fine in a short time.

792
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,440
I just hope

793
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,300
he can forget that

794
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:57,250
he wants to work soon.

795
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,060
What are you two doing?

796
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:00,760
We are figuring out

797
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,890
how to eat the lobster.

798
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,750
Let Lin cook it.

799
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,550
She is good at cooking.

800
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,710
I don't know how to cook lobsters.

801
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:06,960
You can search online.

802
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:07,860
What era is it?

803
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,179
Let's do it.

804
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,820
How to cook lobsters?

805
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,330
How to cook it?

806
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,260
Let me have a look.

807
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,060
Hurry up.

808
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,280
It's holding chopsticks.

809
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,020
I found it.

810
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,170
First,

811
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,139
let lobsters pee first.

812
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:38,350
Pee?

813
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,350
What are you doing?

814
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,480
I am helping it pee.

815
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,540
No, no, no. Search for it.

816
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:47,840
Wait.

817
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,020
I got it.

818
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,980
Turn over the lobster first.

819
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,810
Turn its belly up.

820
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,969
Stick the lobster's tail with a chopstick.

821
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,699
The urine will flow out

822
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,420
along the chopstick.

823
00:34:56,449 --> 00:34:57,560
We have to repeat this many times.

824
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:00,730
What should I do?

825
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:01,580
I have told you.

826
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,860
Turn over and stick the tail.

827
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,420
Stick it. Let it pee.

828
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,200
Do it!

829
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,470
Come on. Stick it.

830
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:10,620
Hurry up.

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,460
You do it. You do it.

832
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,230
You do it. Stick it.

833
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:12,730
No.

834
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:13,320
Hurry up.

835
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,980
I can't do it.

836
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,510
Boil it and let it go.

837
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,760
Don't we let it pee?

-Uncle Cao. -Have a seat.

Uncle Cao,

Now...

I know you're anxious.

I have checked it for you.

Not bad.

00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:39,500
Cool.

858
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,280
Did you go to find Pei Zhi?

859
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:48,800
You haven't said anything else, right?

860
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:51,550
I said nothing else.

861
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:53,090
We just talked about Lin.

862
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:54,660
Why did you talk about me?

863
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:58,450
I said you've been in good condition recently.

864
00:36:59,160 --> 00:36:59,940
Not bad.

865
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,590
I'm trying to get used to it.

866
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:05,900
What's wrong?

867
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,800
What did he tell you?

868
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:12,180
He said we were not suitable for each other.

869
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,750
Did he really say that?

870
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:16,850
You like him?

871
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,430
He said that at first.

872
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,820
What did you answer?

873
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:25,900
Of course I disagreed.

874
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:26,660
He suddenly said that we were not suitable

875
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,020
for no reason.

876
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,490
Right?

877
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,280
There's no reason.

878
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:31,870
And then?

879
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,600
But after that,

880
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,840
it was kind of settled by me.

881
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,010
He said he would come to me in a few days.

882
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,940
Then he was just pretending to be cold.

883
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:49,820
Why are you upset?

884
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,170
Do you like her too?

885
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:56,490
No, no.

886
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,260
No, I'm thinking about

887
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,340
why Pei Zhi

888
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,310
suddenly quit math

889
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,220
and went boxing.

890
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,530
Didn't Pei Zhi study math anymore?

891
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,920
Isn't he my postgraduate student?

892
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,900
Is it because of me?

893
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:10,900
Well...

894
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,500
it's holiday.

895
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,060
Pei Zhi works too hard at school.

896
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,340
He can't study during holidays.

897
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:17,650
He needs to do more exercise.

898
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,780
He should.

899
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:21,940
Look at me,

900
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,280
my body is not good.

901
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,980
I'm old.

902
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,180
Lin,

903
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,820
let me tell you something serious.

904
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:30,410
I want to take the postgraduate entrance exam.

905
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,140
That's good.

906
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,940
Postgraduate students have higher degrees.

907
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,860
It's easy for them to find jobs.

908
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,100
But

909
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:38,140
I want to be a math postgraduate

910
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,130
in Sanwei University.

911
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,230
That's a little difficult.

912
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,460
How is your foundation?

913
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,980
Compared to a student whose major is Math in the university,

914
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,630
I am not that good,

915
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,420
so I want to find a training center for the postgraduate entrance exam.

916
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,570
Do you think it'll work?

917
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,940
You decide it yourself.

918
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,600
My life experience is no more than

919
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,790
yours.

920
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,390
Well,

921
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,670
I'll go out this afternoon

922
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:05,600
to know about the training center for the postgraduate entrance exams.

923
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,120
You stay at home.

924
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:07,940
I'll be good.

925
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,880
I will play games at home.

926
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,890
I'll send you there later.

927
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:14,820
Thank you.

928
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,020
You're welcome.

929
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,660
We found them

930
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,450
from the waste warehouse.

931
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,180
It's exactly the same as yours.

932
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:40,410
Luckily, my daughter responded quickly

933
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:41,700
and pulled me.

934
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,070
Then the car crashed over.

935
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,460
That was close.

936
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,110
Lu Zheng's car is here.

937
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,790
I'll go first.

938
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:52,810
Uncle Cao,

939
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:55,180
when did

940
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:55,700
this batch of equipment come into use?

941
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,860
The detachment was equipped with this

942
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,700
in 2011.

943
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,200
Last year, the detachment installed the law enforcement cameras.

944
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,260
And they were all eliminated.

945
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:02,890
2011...

946
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,020
Pei Zhi,

947
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,210
your dad died

948
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:05,980
in 2009.

949
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:07,930
And the time of this recording

950
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,140
is February 22nd, 2013.

951
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,620
So the voice in the recording

952
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,860
is definitely not your father's.

953
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:15,420
But this is my dad's voice.

954
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,460
Uncle Cao, the manufacturers...

955
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,280
I've checked it for you.

956
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,920
This batch of products were designed and produced

957
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,110
in 2010.

958
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:27,980
What about the traffic accident records?

959
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,160
There is only one hit-and-run

960
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,860
in February 2013.

961
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,090
And the situation

962
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,380
doesn't match the recording.

963
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,700
I see.

964
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,100
Thank you, Uncle Cao.

965
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,230
Pei Zhi.

966
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,450
The dead can't come back to life.

967
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,330
Your dad has gone.

968
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,310
I understand how you feel.

969
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,350
I just want to tell you that

970
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,780
in our team,

971
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,900
there are so many uncles

972
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:23,620
who miss you a lot.

973
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:25,640
Come back often.

974
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,460
Thank you, Uncle Cao.

975
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,340
I will leave first.

976
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:53,560
There are several training centers for the postgraduate entrance exams

977
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,790
around Henghui Square.

978
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,070
Put me

979
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:56,900
there is OK.

980
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,100
Then you can do your things.

981
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,660
I'm not busy.

982
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:00,890
I'll go with you later.

983
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,660
Aren't you busy with work?

984
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,010
I need to rest sometimes.

985
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,420
Lu.

986
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,770
You...

987
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,020
[Lu Zhihao]

988
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,020
[Answer] [Ignore]

989
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,380
Where did you go?

990
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,530
Didn't I tell you that

991
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,970
your vacation is over?

992
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,790
Get back to the meeting now.

993
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,050
Mr. Lu,

994
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,740
I'm driving

995
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,660
to send a guest.

996
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:34,870
Mr Ji,

997
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,860
please come back to the office

998
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,180
when you're not busy.

999
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,460
There are many things waiting for you.

1000
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:43,180
Okay, I'll go back when I'm done.

1001
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,980
Okay, I'll wait for you in the office.

1002
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:46,890
By the way, Lu,

1003
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,780
help me check

1004
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,970
which training center for the postgraduate entrance exam

1005
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:50,890
is the best in our city.

1006
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:53,990
Okay, Mr Ji.

1007
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:55,100
After I'm done,

1008
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:55,700
I'll send it to your phone

1009
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,770
immediately.

1010
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,820
Okay, I'll hang up now.

1011
00:42:58,940 --> 00:42:59,870
Goodbye, Mr Ji.
