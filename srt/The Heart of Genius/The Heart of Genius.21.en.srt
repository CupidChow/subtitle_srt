4
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,220
No one knows that

5
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,390
you bullied me.

6
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:44,750
The thing I can't stand

7
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,450
is that

8
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,280
you took Pei Zhi away from me.

9
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,440
Before you left,

10
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,140
you told Pei Zhi

11
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,460
to take good care of me, right?

12
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:05,990
Yes,

13
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,320
he took good care of me.

14
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,490
He cared so much about me.

15
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:10,840
But, do you know?

16
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,860
Every time he looked at me,

17
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,960
I thought

18
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,770
the person he thinks of is you.

19
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:18,960
He has been waiting for you.

20
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,260
I didn't dare to tell him that

21
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,390
I like him.

22
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,760
I am not confident.

23
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,270
I dare not.

24
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,440
He doesn't know.

25
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,790
I can actually see

26
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,320
what happened.

27
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,250
Every time he mentioned

28
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,290
the things that happened

29
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,130
in the math training camp,

30
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,260
I felt very sad.

31
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:54,740
So...

32
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:56,400
I don't know if you'll come back

33
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,740
and take away my life again.

34
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,500
I'll record a lot of tapes,

35
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,830
then hide them in every corner of the house.

36
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,870
If you come,

37
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,380
when you see it,

38
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,060
I think you must want to know

39
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,300
what's inside.

40
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,700
Because you're curious.

41
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,860
Just like how I'm curious about you.

42
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,750
I have one last request.

43
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,190
If...

44
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,860
I mean if

45
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,670
you really came,

46
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,880
then please leave.

47
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,980
I don't want to be locked

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,089
in a dark house.

49
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,660
If the Hua Juan of Strawberry World

50
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,590
comes,

51
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,590
take him with you.

52
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,160
Hua Juan is silly.

53
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,540
He always thinks

54
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,270
he had a dream

55
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,100
in a daze.

56
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,870
He doesn't believe he jumped.

57
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,060
So please take him with you.

58
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,670
I hope...

59
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,420
I hope no one sees

60
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,550
this video.

61
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,740
I won't watch it anyway.

62
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,210
Since you're always here,

63
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,110
I think you know

64
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,180
I will not stay.

65
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,820
I also want to thank you.

66
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,980
Thank you for your reminder.

67
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,060
It made me

68
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,750
think of a way to defeat Pei Zhi.

69
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,740
Hello, Uncle Pei.

70
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,300

What I'm going to say next

73
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,050
is beyond common sense.

74
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,820
But you must trust me.

75
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,610
Because only when you trust me

174
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,620
I still have 100 ways

175
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,520
to destroy

176
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,790
your plan.

177
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:52,830
I can follow you

178
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,900
and save master before you.

179
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,700
I can keep singing

180
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,980
and destroy all the recordings.

181
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,220
I can even stop

182
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,300
the ambulance and the rescue vehicle.

183
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,260
I can donate

184
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:01,950
ten clearance vehicles

185
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,270
in different models.

186
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:03,980
Then all the voices

187
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,120
can't be restored.

188
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,580
I can

189
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,420
steal my dad's recorder.

190
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,640
I can buy a batch of shooting devices

191
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,400
for the traffic police.

192
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,300
I can even let them

193
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,300
use video law enforcement recorder

194
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,620
in advance.

195
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,340
I can tell the traffic police team

196
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,660
to investigate the drunk driving that day.

197
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:16,690
I can delay the meeting

198
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,300
through Mr. Zeng.

199
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,380
I can even ask my dad

200
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,550
to pick your dad up by motorcycle.

201
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,180
Are you done?

202
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,300
Give up.

203
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,460
You lost the game

204
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,210
from the beginning.

205
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:32,940
I'm sorry.

206
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,390
I'm not the one

207
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,140
you should say sorry to.

208
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,780
It's Pei Zhi from the Cheese World.

209
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,350
You stole his life.

210
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,100
I have one last question for you.

211
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,160
Before you jumped,

212
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:56,990
you promised me that

213
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,570
we will go back to the Strawberry World.

214
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,540
If I didn't

215
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,020
come with you,

216
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,860
would you still go back?

217
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,910
I meant what I promised you.

218
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,430
But when I came to

219
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,260
to this world,

220
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,300
I saw my father.

221
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,540
I bragged with him,

222
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,750
practiced boxing with him, drank with him,

223
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:34,540
and ate with him.

224
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:38,900
I don't know

225
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,240
what I will choose in the end.

226
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,220
It seems that

227
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,240
I lost in the beginning.

228
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,420
Come, wash your hands and eat.

229
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,890
I made fried shrimp.

230
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,340
I followed the recipe.

231
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,140
What is it?

232
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,820
You went for Pei Zhi?

233
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,060
What happened between you two?

234
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,820
I miss my dad.

235
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,700
I'm is here.

236
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,860
Can't you recognize me after the haircut?

237
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:38,700
I'm tired.

238
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,730
I'm going to rest.

239
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,000
Dad, where is the letter?

240
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,620
I sent it for you.

241
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,100
You what?

242
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:51,420
Do you know

243
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,700
what I wrote?

244
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,020
Wasn't it a letter of apology

245
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,490
to Uncle Pei?

246
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,640
No, I...

247
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,470
Did you scold him?

248
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,650
No, it's just that

249
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,490
he can't read it now.

250
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,210
Where did you send it to?

251
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,460
I went out to buy some vegetables,

252
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:04,140
so I put it in his mailbox.

253
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,460
I'll call Pei Zhi.

254
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,540
Got it.

255
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,780
Thank you.

256
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,260
My son is back.

257
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,820
Today,

258
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,890
your mom is attending a class reunion.

259
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,510
It's just the two of us for lunch.

260
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:30,900
What do you want to eat?

261
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,500
Anything is fine, dad.

262
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,740
Let me see what we have.

263
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:24,180
[To Pei Donglai]

264
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,100
Son,

265
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,220
since it's just the two of us,

266
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,150
let's make something simple.

267
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,120
Let's eat noodles served with thick gravy.

268
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:09,900
Son,

269
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,089
do you remember,

270
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,480
when you were in the third year of middle school,

271
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,869
I took you to Happy Valley.

272
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,500
You said you wanted to play roller coaster.

273
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,670
We queued up for two hours,

274
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,670
and finally got here,

275
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,520
but the roller coaster broke down.

276
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:25,900
I remember.

277
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,860
Anyway, it was unlucky that time.

278
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,540
I think our family was unlucky.

279
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:38,820
Do you think

280
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,880
it has something to do with the location of the ancestral tomb?

281
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,280
Dad, what are you thinking?

282
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,900
Those are feudal superstition.

283
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,790
We can't believe it.

284
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,300
The three of us went hiking

285
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,080
the year before last.

286
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,540
We climbed to the temple on top of the mountain

287
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,820
and let go of a lantern to the sky to make a wish.

288
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,060
You haven't told me

289
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,260
the wish

290
00:17:59,280 --> 00:17:59,880
you wrote on the note

291
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:00,950
that you put in the lantern.

292
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,570
Why didn't you tell us?

293
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,480
Since it's a wish,

294
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:05,970
it won't come true if I tell you.

295
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,850
It's feudal superstition.

296
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,770
It won't come true even if you don't tell me.

297
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,620
I remember I wrote that

298
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,280
I wish my family

299
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,310
can be safe and healthy.

300
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,850
I don't remember the details.

301
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,620
When people get old,

302
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,840
they like to recall the past.

303
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,650
Do you remember my accident?

304
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,860
A few days ago,

305
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,100
you mom talked about it.

306
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,740
In 2009,

307
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:38,820
I was chasing a robber

308
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,980
on a motorcycle.

309
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,700
In the process of pulling,

310
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,180
both of us fell down.

311
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,630
I hit my head

312
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,540
on the road.

313
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,220
Luckily, the helmet saved my life.

314
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:55,780
I remember.

315
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,300
That time,

316
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,620
I was hospitalized for half a month.

317
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,180
You folded a lot of paper cranes for me.

318
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,220
Lin Zhaoxi came to see me too.

319
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,080
You two even folded the cranes together.

320
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,420
You were so close back then.

321
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,690
You two were so innocent.

322
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,840
Lin Zhaoxi also said

323
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,130
she will be my daughter-in-law.

324
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,090
At that time,

325
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:39,980
I worried that

326
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,380
your love will have a bad effect.

327
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,610
But now you two

328
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,420
stopped seeing each other.

329
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,060
Time changes people.

330
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,580
But time won't make you

331
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,710
another person.

332
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,080
Who are you?

333
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,240
Dad, what are you talking about?

334
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,620
I'm Pei Zhi.

335
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,340
Dad.

336
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,540
I'm going to find Pei Zhi.

337
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,400
I'll go with you.

338
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:43,910
No need.

339
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,780
I can go by myself.

340
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:45,540
Wait.

341
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,150
What did you write in the letter?

342
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,290
I'll explain to you later.

343
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,220

After I came to this world,

516
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:12,590
I learned something.

517
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,580
I haven't told you

518
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,220
why Pei in this world

519
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:20,900
is alive.

520
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:23,540
Because you

521
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,300
saved him.

522
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:28,900
I...

523
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,280
In Strawberry World in 2009,

524
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,530
I was in the third year of middle school.

525
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:39,840
I received

526
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,860
an invitation from the University of Technology.

527
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,100
They wanted me

528
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,000
to join their Youth Class

529
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:43,760
and major in math.

530
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,110
I really wanted to go.

531
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:50,950
My mom firmly opposed it.

532
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:52,920
My dad supported me.

533
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,780
One time,

534
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:02,200
when I went to school,

535
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,700
they had a big fight at home.

536
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,560
They asked you to study math.

537
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:08,900
They asked you to study math.

538
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,070
Isn't it good to be an ordinary person?

539
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:10,820
Why are you lashing on these books?

540
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,350
Come on.

541
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,360
He's just

542
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,070
a student in the third year of middle school.

543
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:13,850
You let him study

544
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,530
Math in Juvenile University?

545
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,190
My son is

546
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:16,890
a math genius.

547
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,940
What math genius?

548
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:18,820
Is everything

549
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,220
up to you?

550
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:19,940
Of course.

551
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:20,860
I'm his mother.

552
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,290
Okay, It's all up to you.

553
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:25,820
In anger,

554
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,380
my mom broke my dad's helmet.

555
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:41,820
You...

556
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:46,210
Are you crazy?

557
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,380
That night,

558
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,740
my dad was on duty.

559
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:52,860
He ran into a robber

560
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,780
on a motorcycle.

561
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:58,940
I'll be here soon. I...

562
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,620
Help!

563
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,710
Someone robbed my bag! Catch the thief!

564
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,740
Someone, he grabbed my bag!

565
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,110
Help!

566
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:15,580
[Emergency Repair of Electric Power]

567
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,020
When chasing, the motorcycle

568
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,730
lost balance and fell on the ground.

569
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,220
My dad hit his head

570
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,520
on the roadside.

571
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,150
The helmet was broken on the spot.

572
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,040
When he was sent to the hospital,

573
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,060
they failed to save him.

574
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,020
Then the traffic police team told my mom,

575
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,530
if the helmet hadn't been broken,

576
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,710
my dad wouldn't have died.

577
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:20,780
If it's not because

578
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,800
I wanted to study math.

579
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,580
If it's not because

580
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,800
I wanted to enter the juvenile class,

581
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:35,350
they wouldn't quarrel.

582
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:37,860
My mom wouldn't

583
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,230
break my dad's helmet,

584
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,340
my dad wouldn't have died.

585
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,860
It's not like that.

586
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,650
Pei Zhi, it's not your fault.

587
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,830
It's all my fault.

588
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,720
It was just an accident.

589
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,140
I'm sorry.

590
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,380
Pei Zhi from the Cheese World

591
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,020
also received

592
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,670
an invitation from the University of Technology.

593
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:16,679
in his third year of middle school.

594
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,699
But he refused.

595
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:22,889
It took me a month

596
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:24,810
to know why he refused.

597
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,500
Later, Lu Zhihao

598
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,130
told me.

599
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,550
He said because I told him

600
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,270
I promised someone

601
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,780
to take care of you in this world.

602
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,580
I guess it was 2006,

603
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,860
when I jumped to this world,

604
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,929
you asked Pei Zhi from the Cheese World

605
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,739
to take good care of

606
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,130
of Lin Zhaoxi of the Cheese World.

607
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,100
Are you going back?

608
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,140
I won't see you again.

609
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:15,640
I'm leaving.

610
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:18,100
In this world,

611
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,400
there will be another Lin Zhaoxi,

612
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,140
a real me

613
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,200
in this world.

614
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,870
She may be gentle,

615
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:30,760
sensitive and fragile.

616
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,870
Take care of her for me.

617
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,760
I will.

618
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,390
So he kept his promise.

619
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:46,780
In order to be in the same class with you,

620
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,040
I submitted blank papers every time.

621
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,820
In order to be in the same class with you,

622
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,880
I refused the University of Technology.

623
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,550
The source of all these changes

624
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,220
is because

625
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,530
Pei Zhi from the Cheese World

626
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,330
can't forget you.

627
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,790
Without you,

628
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:13,240
Pei from the Cheese World

629
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,580
can't get rid of bad luck.

630
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,860
I wouldn't have known

631
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,080
the existence of a parallel world.

632
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,340
I will never

633
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,000
have the chance

634
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,160
to see my dad.

635
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,620
I'm sorry.

636
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:35,940
I should be sorry.

637
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,780
We're even now.

638
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:57,130
Lin Zhaoxi.

639
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,290
There are so many regrets

640
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:03,580
in the Strawberry World.

641
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,660
Why do you still want to go back?

642
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:10,580
Yeah.

643
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,860
There are so many regrets in the Strawberry World:

644
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,460
middle school,

645
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:22,660
college entrance exam,

646
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,420
university,

647
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,810
and Lin's illness.

648
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:29,940
But who can have

649
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,420
a perfect life?

650
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,900
Even if we can start over,

651
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,300
there will be new regrets.

652
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:37,880
What should we do then?

653
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:40,540
Jump to

654
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,460
a new world?

655
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,300
You said jumping is cheating.

656
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,130
Everyone wants

657
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,290
a life that one can cheat in.

658
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,220
But I don't want to.

659
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,240
I just want to face life.

660
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,980
Like you said,

661
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,880
I won't be a coward.

662
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,680
Pei.

663
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,690
Mr. Lin, why are you here?

664
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,680
Is there any news about Pei Zhi?

665
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,370
She found him.

666
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,820
Xi asked me

667
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,640
to tell you.

668
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,180
Let's go.

669
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:30,940
Where are they?

670
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,060
What happened to your leg?

671
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:33,430
Nothing. I sprained my ankle.

672
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,740
They are at school.

673
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,830
Don't worry.

674
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,230
Right.

675
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:38,740
You have to tell me

676
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,980
what happened.

677
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,900
What does the letter say?

678
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,930
You should know this.

679
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,460
Your daughter is also involved.

680
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,090
I'm afraid you won't believe me.

681
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,780
Let's go.

682
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,960
Strawberry World, Cheese World.

683
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:59,860
You're really good at naming.

684
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,620
I'm a little girlish too.

685
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,170
Okay.

686
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:17,680
Lin, I'm here.

687
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,240
Come home with me.

688
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,460
Go home with me.

689
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:06,240
What is your world like?

690
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,680
You know everything?

691
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,970
Are you mad at me, dad?

692
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:22,980
Why would I be mad at you?

693
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,030
[A Green, Environmentally Friendly]

694
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,030
[and Civilized City]

695
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,100
If my guess is right,

696
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,730
you were the one who cried

697
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,400
and claimed I was your dad.

698
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,420
I...

699
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,200
When did I cry?

700
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:36,140
Yes.

701
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:36,900
Without you,

702
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,500
I wouldn't have

703
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,090
meet Xi of this world.

704
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,340
I won't adopt Hua Juan either.

705
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,700
You are the terminator

706
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:44,600
of my carefree life.

707
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,100
I'm sorry.

708
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,160
for causing you trouble.

709
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,940
Yes, two troubles.

710
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,700
But without you two,

711
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:59,700
maybe my life

712
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,050
wouldn't have been so interesting.

713
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,540
Math is quite wonderful.

714
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,660
It could be the most wonderful thing.

715
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,780
It's the starry sky, the universe,

716
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,240
but not everything in life.

717
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,460
If only I knew this

718
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,100
sooner.

719
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,690
Do you know, dad?

720
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,340
I think

721
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,180
no matter where I am,

722
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,460
you are the best dad

723
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,540
in my heart.

724
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:26,450
No.

725
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,280
Not only the whole world,

726
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,770
but the whole universe

727
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:34,660
and

728
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,340
all-dimensional space.

729
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,400
All three-dimensional space!

730
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:42,780
Let's go.

731
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,930
I remember when I was young,

732
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:52,500
if I was tired after playing,

733
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,620
you would just carried me

734
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,100
from the park to home.

735
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:00,940
No matter how tired you are,

736
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,010
if I don't speak up,

737
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:04,380
you won't put me down.

738
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:11,140
Dad.

739
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:17,860
Don't worry.

740
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,820
I will return your son

741
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,390
to you.

742
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:25,650
Today,

743
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:27,470
it's my fault.

744
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:30,300
I should have told you.

745
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:32,020
I was too anxious.

746
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,430
Did I hurt you?

747
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,300
Dad.

748
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,940
Before I leave,

749
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,460
could you pretend that I was him?

750
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,890
Even if it's just a little bit.

751
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,220
I promise you.
