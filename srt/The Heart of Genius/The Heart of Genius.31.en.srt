They're just people's instincts.

But they are also prejudices.

made my father being criticized

Did you often go to

places like this in Germany?

you are really talented in music.

629
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,340
Actually, I think

630
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,050
there is something in common

631
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,580
between math and music.

632
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,940
How?

633
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,540
Many people think that math is

634
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,660
just a complex machine consisting of

635
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,850
a bunch of numbers and formulas.

636
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,300
But it's not.

637
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,540
Actually, I think math itself

638
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,580
is full of beauty

639
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:10,750
and creativity.

640

people use a bunch of

643

logical symbols to express math.

644
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,680
Music is the same.

645
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,030
Musicians use a bunch of symbols

646
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,460
to express

647
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:22,930
their emotions, rhythm

648

You're in a good mood.

689
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,650
I lost the game.

690
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,090
It's fine.

691
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,340
It's worth it.

692

Hearing what you said,

693
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:42,930

694
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:45,740
Yes. Me too.

695
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:46,590
But

696
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,920
we have to live on air.

697
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,840
Get up.

698
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,700
I know you're not asleep. Stop pretending.

699

Dad.

700
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,180

00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,990

No mind-twisting things.

Why are you reading your paper again?

It's hot. It's cool to sleep on them.

I don't want to give up.

723

Why?

724
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,520
I almost finish my research.

If I can prove that I'm right,

726
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,190
does that mean

727

everyone will forget the past?

suffer so many grievances.

730
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,600
I'm not, dad.

00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:07,180
If they weren't against me,

732
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,480
I wouldn't have said so much

733
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,000
to vent my anger, right?

734
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,380
I feel relieved too.

735
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,139
Don't think too much, okay?

No.

nothing is more important

than your health.

is not good enough.

Even if you don't think for yourself,

750

you should think for me.

751

anyone I've ever met.

760
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,870
But what is the evidence

761
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,140
proving that he plagiarized?

762
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,020
They're just people's instincts.

763
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,660
But they are also prejudices.

764

However, it is these prejudices that

765

made my father Lin Zhaosheng

being criticized for so-called academic misconduct

for more than 20 years.

860
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,050
Listen to me.

861
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:21,750
That's what I want to tell you.

862
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,180
Master has been studying this

863
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,720
for over 20 years.

864
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,000
Go and tell him

865
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,250
I helped him

866
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,160
finish the last part.

867
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,510
Do you think he will be happy?

868
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:32,590
How will he feel?

869
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:33,780
He...

870
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:36,450
After reading it,

871
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,780
he should be happy.

872
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,210
Or what?

873
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:40,590
He's worked hard for so many years.

874
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,630
No, I mean

875
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:44,980
I want him to think

876
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,550
he did it himself.

877
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,140
Why are you avoiding

878
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,120
your credit?

879
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:51,920
You two

880
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,540
finish it together.

881
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:54,710
Yes.

882
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,720
One percent.

883
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,160
My dad once said

884
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,220
even if he finished

885
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,040
the first 99 percent,

886
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,260
the last step

887
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,320
is harder than

888
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,160
than the 99 steps ahead.

889
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,420
Without

890
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,620
his foundation,

891
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,310
these pages

892
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:10,650
are useless.

893
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,450
I just helped him

894
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:13,440
finish the last part.

895
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:15,220
All glory

896
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,450
should belong to master.

897
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,240
You know what?

898
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:25,470
My dad has been criticized

899
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,070
for plagiarism for over 20 years.

900
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:29,240
He hates cheating the most.

901
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:30,110
Yes.

902
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,590
That's why I want him to think

903
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:36,600
he did it himself.

904
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:38,700
Why do you have to

905
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:39,520
avoid your role?

906
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:40,660
Because my role

907
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:41,620
in it is tiny.

908
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:44,840
Listen to me.

909
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,830
Master is sick.

910
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,620
He can't remember many things clearly.

911
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:51,930
I just want him

912
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,780
to be happy

913
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:54,870
once.

914
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:56,180
He has studied

915
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:56,880
for over 20 years.

916
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,260
If you tell him now

917
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,680
I finished the last stroke,

918
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,380
do you think he'll be happy?
