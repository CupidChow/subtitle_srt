4
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,660
How long did it take us

5
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,870
to get here

6
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,780
from the first floor?

7
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,780
Eight and a half minutes.

8
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,340
Eight and a half minutes?

9
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,430
How long does it take to go shopping normally?

10
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,300
Maybe half an hour?

11
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,340
I'm afraid it should be more than that.

12
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,080
Look at Bao Xiaomeng.

13
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:55,990
Usually, it will take her

14
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,670
four hours to go shopping.

15
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:57,789
-Four hours? -Yes.

16
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,280
Think about it,

17
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,730
if there are four floors in a shopping mall,

18
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,620
she will

19
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:02,890
spend an hour on each floor.

20
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,270
This floor is about 80 meters long.

21
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,630
Including the time to walk around,

22
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,610
it'll only take five minutes.

23
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,090
Does she have a boyfriend?

24
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,670
Not yet.

25
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,350
Then you're wrong.

26
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,510
The time should be more than that.

27
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:18,650
Think about it.

28
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,180
Every mall has floors of men's clothes

29
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,970
and children’s section.

30
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,550
She doesn't need to go to these places.

31
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,060
Also, there are places for food and rest.

32
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,720
We need to remove these parts as well.

33
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,100
Some stores, she will only stay in them shortly,

34
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,100
while in others, she will look at the products carefully and stay longer.

35
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,100
In that case,

36
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,050
if she spend four hours in this shopping mall,

37
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,220
she will spend at least one and a half hours

38
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,010
in the parts she wants to stay longer.

39
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,440
One and a half hours?

40
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,690
Is she going to

41
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,640
try all the clothes

42
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,170
in every store?

43
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,070
Look at you and look at me.

44
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,300
I don't think we're suitable

45
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,320
to go shopping.

46
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,820
I kind of miss calculus now.

47
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,470
How about

48
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:56,550
go back to class?

49
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,500
But if I go back now,

50
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,320
my mom should still be here.

51
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,300
Let's take a walk then.

52
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,660
Okay.

53
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,770
Let's slow down our paces

54
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,540
and walk slowly.

55
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:14,910
Okay.

56
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,540
Look.

57
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:19,950
Look at that.

58
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,160
There is a couple.

59
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,020
They walk so slowly.

60
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,430
But they're not looking at any clothes.

61
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,660
I don't think they're a couple.

62
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,060
Am I wrong?

63
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,460
They walk so slowly,

64
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:36,310
but they don't have close physical contact.

65
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:37,750
And it seems that

66
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,820
they are chatting happily.

67
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,150
But actually,

68
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:41,850
the way they walk

69
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,680
is overcautious.

70
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,260
They want to leave

71
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,290
a good impression to each other.

72
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:46,940
Especially that man.

73
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,079
Look.

74
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,490
His posture is very stiff when he walked.

75
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,100
And he walked in a quite slow speed.

76
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,510
Maybe he ate something bad.

77
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,340
That's impossible.

78
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,340
It's true!

79
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,100
Look.

80
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:00,690
He always walks slower

81
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,730
than that girl.

82
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,740
I guess he didn't want to ruin the atmosphere.

83
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,300
Look.

84
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,910
He suggested catching dolls

85
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,920
and took a few steps slower.

86
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,300
Here's your chance.

87
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:13,810
One, two, three.

88
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,490
I can't laugh so much.

89
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,370
It's not good.

90
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,130
You're amazing.

91
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,690
You even guessed that?

92
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,800
When I studied in Germany,

93
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,060
I don't have any friends.

94
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,030
So I like to

95
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:33,690
observe others.

96
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,730
Therefore I know the secrets of a lot of people

97
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,400
in the school.

98
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,490
Will you share their secrets

99
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,550
to others?

100
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:41,850
The reason why secrets are called secrets

101
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,020
is that they don't

102
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,010
want to tell others.

103
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,630
So even if I saw it,

104
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,300
I won't tell anyone.

105
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,290
It seems that

106
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,570
you just shared a secret

107
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,460
of a passerby to me.

108
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,110
Is stomachache a secret?

109
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,130
It doesn't count? Maybe it is a secret.

110
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,150
I don't think so.

111
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,480
What about you?

112
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,230
Do you have any secrets

113
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,290
that you can't tell me

114
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,120
or you don't wanna say?

115
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,040
Me?

116
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,060
My biggest secret should be

117
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,490
to go to the parallel world.

118
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,920
I told you everything.

119
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,410
Yes.

120
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,020
It's a big secret.

121
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,580
I haven't caught a doll yet.

122
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,300
Catch dolls?

123
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,300

deep inside,

145
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,280

00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,400
he had such feelings for her.

♫I wanna chase a better desitiny♫

150
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,630
He mustered up the courage to tell his love to her.

151
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,640
She rejected him.

152
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,150
She would rather choose him who has a family

153
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,580
than him who is still single.

154
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,870
Even if this relationship

155
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,170
has no future.

156
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:08,840
I'm sorry.

158
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,740
Would you please excuse me for a moment?

159
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,790
Mr. Lu, I...

160
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,860
Did I say something wrong?

161
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,160
No.

162
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:19,560
But later,

when you say it again,

please say their names.

OK. Say their name.

It's okay.

175

to perform in this drama.

177

That's great.

178
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:04,940
Then we can check the contract.

179

Okay.

Where did Mr Ji go?

181
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,460
He said

182
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,650
he was very touched

183
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,080
when you introduced the plot to him.

184
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,870
He needs some time to comfort his emotion.

185
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,540
Professional.

186
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,220
He began to sympathizing with the character

187

before entering the crew.

188
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,780
So professional.

189
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,300
Okay, let's leave the matter of drafting the contract

190

Yes.

Xi told you?

273

She didn't tell me.

274
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,170
I know

when and where you traveled to

277
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,340
I found a CCTV footage

Didn't you want to see your dad?

284
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,600
Because I'm afraid I'll stay there.

Why are you laughing?

289
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,700
I'm laughing

290
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,260
because you and Xi are really similar.

291
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,170

at Sanwei University today.

298
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,060
So you went to Sanwei University for this lecture?

299
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,470
No, I listened to it online.

300
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,210
Howard, is he a great scholar?

301
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,270
He is the leading expert in the field of P-versus-NP problem.

302
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,600
How much do you know

303
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,470
about P-versus-NP problem?

304
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,960
I only heard you talked about it

305
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,270
when I was a kid.

306
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,390
You said that

307
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,730
the Clay Mathematics Institute in USA

308
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,050
set up a bonus

309
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,340
for seven mathematical conjectures.

310
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,080
They are called

311
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,350
the seven most difficult math problems worldwide.

312
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,030
They are the summits that

313
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,400
everyone wants to reach.

314
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,460
It is your dream

315
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,600
to solve the P=NP problem.

316
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,380
As for the rest,

317
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,460
I haven't heard about other things from you.

318
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,740
If P=NP,

319
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,120
it means

320
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,500
humans can calculate

321
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,900
the solution of all problems quickly.

322
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,740
This result

323
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,820
can be used in various fields.

324
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,050
For example, medical treatment.

325
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,010
By then,

326
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,420
there will be no chemotherapy.

327
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,490
We just need

328
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,140
a simple genetic test,

329
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,070
and then we can know

330
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,780
which cells are good

331
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,520
and which cells are cancer cells.

332
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,580
So we can create

333
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:19,890
a specific protein

334
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,470
to starve these cancer cells,

335
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:24,330
extract them

336
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,420
and treat cancer.

337
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,380
The new medical results

338
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,090
is not only effective,

339
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,790
but also very cheap.

340
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,740
All patients

341
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,130
should be able to afford it.

342
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,330
But first,

343
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,250
we need to find the algorithm

344
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,490
to solve NP problems.

345
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,890
That is P=NP.

346
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,380
Unfortunately,

347
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,940
the algorithm hasn't shown up yet.

348
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,170
None of the mathematicians have been found.

349
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:52,900
Howard doesn't know.

350
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,800
I don't know either.

351
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,790
Did you surf the Internet secretly?

352
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,490
Actually, from the beginning,

353
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,940
my goal

354
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,130
is not to prove P=NP directly.

355
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,700
If a problem

356
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,099
can find its algorithm

357
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,089
in polynomial times,

358
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,630
it's the problem of P.

359
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,210
And the NP problem is

360
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,430
if we can't find

361
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,500
the answer quickly,

362
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,700
But if we have a

363
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,500
known solution,

364
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:15,670
we can

365
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,609
verify its problem

366
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,920
in polynomial time.

367
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,079
I don't understand.

368
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:23,859
Until

369
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:25,329
the Satisfiability Problem arises,

370
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,960
a series of NPC problems

371
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,280
will appear.

372
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,590
To prove

373
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,620
a new NPC problem,

374
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,040
you just need to

375
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,270
reduce it to an known NPC problem.

376
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,500
It sounds quite simple

377
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,500
after you explained it.

378
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,380
I...

379
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,160
That's how far my research went.

380
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,220
As for the P-versus-NP problem,

381
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,360
I think I should leave it to the next generation.

382
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,620
For example, you.

383
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,940
Me?

384
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,020
It's too far.

385
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,130
What's your goal in learning math?

386
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,660
My temporary goal

387
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,170
is to learn math.

388
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,730
Although I think even if I can learn math,

389
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,620
a person like me

390
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:09,900
can't be like you and Pei Zhi,

391
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,500
it's not as meaningful

392
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,450
for me to learn math.

393
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,840
Actually,

394
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,680
meaning is not the most important.

395
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,050
If we want to find out some

396
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,240
meaning in everything,

397
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,240
in the end,

398
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,520
there is nothing we can do but crying.

399
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,100
And I think

400
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,580
IQ is not the most important.

401
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,620
Actually,

402
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,540
the most important thing should be a firm dream,

403
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,860
you should keep your passion in this process.

404
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,620
You need to find happiness in research.

405
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,100
And be loyal to your study.

406
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,500
Also...

407
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,620
I'm hungry.

408
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,580
I'll get you some snacks.

409
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,780
You'll cook?

410
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,860
Let me do it.

411
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,980
Pei Zhi, take a look.

412
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,120
Look at the birthday gift

413
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:17,820
for you.

414
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,520
Open it.

415
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:19,660
Hurry up.

416
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,810
Thank you, mom.

417
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,990
Wait.

418
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,370
I bought this for you.

419
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,480
Why did you say thank you to your mom?

420
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,540
Dad, given the fact that every month,

421
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,490
you can only have 50 yuan as your pocket money,

422
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,170
you have to ask for mom's permission when you want to buy anything.

423
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,760
Look how smart my son is.

424
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:38,790
Can't I

425
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,380
buy it with my own money?

426
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,580
Dad, I didn't mean to underestimate you.

427
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,380
But it seems that you are lack of the bravery to do so.

428
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:46,970
You little devil.

429
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,680
All right, blow out the candles.

430
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,740
This is my birthday gift for you.

431
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,300
Who is it?

432
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,030
It’s me, Ji Jiang.

433
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,190
Dad, why didn’t you open the door?

434
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,100
Morning.

435
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,230
Morning, Uncle Lin.

436
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,620
You're here, Ji.

437
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,360
The oysters are very fresh this time.

438
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,700
But Uncle Lin doesn't like raw food.

439
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,940
It's also good to steam it.

440
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,990
Ji Jiang,

441
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,000
I think I told you everything clearly

442
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,100
last time.

443
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,590
I know.

444
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,340
this is the last time

445
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,460
I send seafood to Uncle Lin.

446
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,280
I've practiced at home this time.

447
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,240
I promise it’ll be delicious.

448
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:20,790
I didn't expect

449
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,020
I'm quite good at cooking.

450
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,970
Go back to work.

451
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:31,910
I need to

452
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,860
make some seasoning later.

453
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,510
Go.

454
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,980
You don't have to stay here with me.

455
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,530
Let me help you.

456
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,740
No, no, no.

457
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,650
All done.

458
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,140
Here.

459
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,100
Would you like to have some wine?

460
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,720
OK. Let's have some wine.

461
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,310
I'll do it.

462
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,350
Okay, thank you.

463
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:10,930
Here.

464
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:11,780
Thank you.

465
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,450
How is it? Not bad, right?

466
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,100
It's tender and sweet.

467
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,540
Let me say something.

468
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,740
I'm here

469
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,530
to say goodbye.

470
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,380
I'm going to start filming soon.

471
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,860
I'll stay there for a few months.

472
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,250
Congratulations.

473
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,260
It's a good thing that you can start all over again.

474
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,260
After this movie,

475
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,880
I plan to move the company to Shanghai.

476
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,310
There are more opportunities there.

477
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,390
I may not be able to come here often.

478
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,350
Thank you

479
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,100
for taking care of me.

480
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:52,980
Here.

481
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,660
It was you

482
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:54,930
who has been taking care of us.

483
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,340
Here.

484
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,740
Come on.

485
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,220
I won't say anything.

486
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,100
A toast to you.

487
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,120
I'll stop talking then.

488
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:04,870
My good wish is all in the wine.

489
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,600
All in the wine.

490
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,380
Eat.

491
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,020
Help yourself.

492
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,300
Eat.

493
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,220
Don't drink too much.

494
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,060
Okay.

495
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,330
Let me see you off.

496
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,540
It's okay.

497
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,020
Someone will pick me up later.

498
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,180
I'll take a walk

499
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,130
and go to the entrance of this alley.

500
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,780
Hua Juan.

501
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,310
You moved out because of me, right?

502
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,640
Who else can it be

503
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,860
if it's not because of you?

504
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:48,720
I feel more sorry

505
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,920
if you say that.

506
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,060
Look at you.

507
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,890
You're being honest again, aren't you?

508
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,420
I'm imitating you.

509
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,940
You're so straightforward.

510
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,010
Don't worry.

511
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,580
I decided to go to Shanghai

512
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,980
for my future development.

513
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,420
It's not all for you.

514
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,180
You will meet

515
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,410
someone more suitable.

516
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,000
Lin Zhaoxi,

517
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:17,780

518

I will only share happiness with them.

520

Only you

521

shared hardships with me.

522
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,280
In my heart,

523
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,900
no one can compare with you.

524
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,520
I went to see Pei Zhi last night.

525
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,440
I saw you two

526
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,820
holding hands.

527
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,620
I felt very uncomfortable.

528
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,550
I just had a fight with him.

529
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:49,770
Is everything okay?

530
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,980
He's fine. He had complete victory.

531
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,110
I mean, are you okay?

532
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,750
I admit that I can't defeat Pei Zhi in a fight.

533
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,730
But I'm not convinced that you two should be together,

534
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,610
because I'm the one who loves you more.

535
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,810
I'm the one who jumped with you.

536
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,080
We should be boyfriend and girlfriend.

537
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,180
Pei Zhi is an extra person.

538
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,480
That's what I've been thinking.

539
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,460
So I told him

540
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,170
about the formula.

541
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,640
You told him?

542
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,700
I hope he won't come back

543
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,750
after he goes to that world.

544
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,420
But he already knew.

545
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,210
At that moment, I knew

546
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,930
I lost.

547
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,790
You two are a couple.

548
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,480

Are you sending me a "good person card", which means you refused me?

Don't see me off.

561
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,180
I'm afraid I'll cry.

562

It's a pity that Pei Zhi is here.

Where can we find it?

That's not easy.

586
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,190
I heard an accountant was beaten to death.

587

Don't talk nonsense.

588

He was hit on his head, that's all.

You are well-informed.

It's not serious,

but he has lost his mind.

We don't know if he's pretending or not.

597
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,410
How could he pretend something like that?

598
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,390
Why can't he?

599
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,490
He's afraid of taking the responsibility.

remove his personal belongings?

00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,470
I'm looking for Xiaomeng.

854
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,120
Keep an eye on her.

855
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,530
Do you know Pei Zhi?

856
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,510
Uncle Lin.

857
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,310
I...

858
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:24,660
No, no, no.

859
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,450
From now on, answer my questions.

860
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,150
Don't talk, don't shout.

861
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,180
And don't ask my questions.

862
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:29,920
Do you hear me?

863
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:31,340
Really?

864
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,600
Do you know Pei Zhi?

865
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:36,710
You lost your memory?

866
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:37,820
Don't ask questions.

867
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:39,530
Yes.

868
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,320
Okay.

869
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,380
Where is he?

870
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,300
He should be in the classroom, since the classes are not ended.

871
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,150
Take me to him.

872
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:46,450
He's your deskmate.

873
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,580
Why do you need me to take you to him?

874
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,980
He and I are in the same class?

875
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,680
Yes, you, he and I are in the same class.

876
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:54,790
We are in the same class too?

877
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,380
Yes.

878
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,500
Where is our classroom?

879
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,770
What's wrong with you?
