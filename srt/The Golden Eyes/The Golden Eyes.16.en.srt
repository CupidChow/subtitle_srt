00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,500
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,500
Episode 16

3
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:43,039
Leaving the pawnshop was a blessing in disguise.

4
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,039
I didn't even ask you to pay for that Tamamoku jade.

5
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,560
Tamamoku jade? -That's right.

6
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,020
Not only did the robbers hurt you,...

7
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:54,970
...they also broke the Tamamoku jade on our display.

8
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,729
That was a Tamamoku jade from the Qin Dynasty.

9
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,030
Wasn't that a blessing in disguise?

10
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,240
Had it not been for those incidents,...

11
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,570
...you wouldn't be this lucky,am I right?

12
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,040
Luck? I meant,it's all thanks to your ability.

13
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,920
To be bestowed with great responsibility,...

14
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,280
...one has to..... -One has to quit the pawnshop.

15
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,120
Manager Liu and Uncle De, please go ahead and continue.

16
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,680
I have a call to make.

17
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,000
Uncle De,I have a favour to ask of you.

18
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,320
Feifei,during the pawnshop robbery,...

19
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,560
...was a piece of Tamamoku jade broken?

20
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,520
Yes,a Tamamoku jade was indeed broken.

21
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,340
Why are you asking about that?

22
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,240
May I take a look at it?

23
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,680
You're the victim,why do you need to see that?

24
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,840
As someone in the jade industry, I might be of some help...

25
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,170
...by providing clues.

26
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,240
Forget it,Grandpa Gu inspected the piece.

27
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,720
He couldn't find out anything, what makes you think you can?

28
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,520
Grandpa Gu inspected the piece?

29
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,960
He said that it was originally a pair.

30
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,960
However,the quality...

31
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,120
...was inferior.

32
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,720
Feifei,may I take a look at it?

33
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,320
I'll see what I can do.

34
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,840
Don't put your hopes up too high. -Thank you.

35
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,280
Don't thank me. It's important for us to work together.

36
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,520
A pair of Tamamoku jade?

37
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,840
Xiao Rui,you're a successful young man now.

38
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,320
You can buy everything that you see.

39
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,000
You've bought a lot. -No,it's not that.

40
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,070
Those are small items. You're in a good mood today...

41
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,829
...so I'm inviting you over to my home.

42
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:20,760
I was just thinking about paying a visit to your home.

43
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,440
Regarding what Manager Liu said earlier,...

44
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,900
...don't take it to heart.

45
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,120
Everyone knows that during the robbery,...

46
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,640
...you got injured from protecting the antiques.

47
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,120
Who knew Manager Liu would fire you without a word.

48
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,200
Look at you now, starting your own business.

49
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,000
You are now the owner of Ruiyunzhai.

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,800
I wonder if Manager Liu can sleep well tonight.

51
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,400
It's nothing. If it hadn't been for Manager Liu,...

52
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,240
...with RMB 2000 penalty fee,...

53
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,400
...I couldn't even afford Sanheliu's ceramic gourd.

54
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,560
I have him to thank for that. -Well said.

55
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,240
Xiao Rui.

56
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,960
You grow up so quick.

57
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,290
You have guided me well.

58
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,800
Real sage found in wild, good sage found in town.

59
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,570
Uncle De,you're a legend in the antiquing industry.

60
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,040
I've been wanting to pay you a visit.

61
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,920
I didn't think I would bump into you here.

62
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,200
What more could I ask for?

63
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,880
Mr. Qin,you're too kind.

64
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,440
I'm merely a veteran industry player.

65
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,440
Uncle De,you're being humble.

66
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,080
The phoenix crown worn by princesses in the Tang Dynasty.

67
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,400
Unlined garments from the Mongolian tomb.

68
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,930
The Five Horses drawing that is in the museum.

69
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,720
Which of your restoration feat is not a legend in the industry?

70
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,800
I was wondering where Xiao Rui got his discerning eyes.

71
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,640
It turns out he's your disciple.

72
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,680
No,Xiao Rui has an innate talent...

73
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,280
...and he works really hard.

74
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,840
I dare not take credit for his accomplishments.

75
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,040
Xiao Rui,Director Qin made a trip here...

76
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,200
...to discuss something with you. I won't disturb you.

77
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,600
Don't leave yet,Uncle De.

78
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,900
It isn't anything urgent.

79
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,000
I came here to visit Xiao Rui...

80
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,360
...but I've always wanted to have a chat with you.

81
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,440
If it's alright with you, I'll treat you to dinner.

82
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,930
No need for that. The two of you, go ahead and talk.

83
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,840
We'll find a time when everyone's available...

84
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,770
...and then we'll have a proper talk. I'll leave now.

85
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,200
Alright,I'll send you back. -No need for that.

86
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,040
I have a habit of taking my time to walk.

87
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,560
Alright,goodbye. -Goodbye,Uncle De.

88
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,920
I've heard from antique dealers about him.

89
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,440
It's a pity that he left the industry due to old age.

90
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,840
If not,he would've restored countless rare antiques.

91
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,920
Looking at him today,...

92
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,090
...he seems to be in good shape.

93
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,970
Have a seat,Mr. Qin.

94
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,440
There have been many people asking him to return...

95
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,160
...but Uncle De said that restoring antiques takes energy...

96
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,120
...and time.

97
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,320
He's afraid that antiques would break in his hand due to old age.

98
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,120
He'd rather invest his energy on things that he likes.

99
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,520
Things that he likes?

100
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,040
What about you?

101
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,360
Do you like the jade industry?

102
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,480
Me?

103
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,880
The reason that I came here is to thank you.

104
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,600
I'm also here because I appreciate your talent.

105
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,040
Your discerning eyes have never failed you in stone gambling.

106
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,440
Besides,you are honest, kind and humble.

107
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,770
You've helped our Qin family a great deal.

108
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,160
For that,I have a gift for you.

109
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,040
Xuanbing is my friend so I was just doing my job.

110
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,640
The gift that I speak of is not a common gift.

111
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,720
I'd like to invite you to come to Kiev with me.

112
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,030
At the core of stone gambling is a business deal.

113
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,840
To engage in big businesses,you need a rich marketing resource.

114
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,880
I want to introduce to you...

115
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,340
...to my connections in Ukraine.

116
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,360
I don't want be involved in big businesses.

117
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,240
This is in preparation for the gemstone auction in Cambodia.

118
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,520
This auction,compared with the Pingzhou auction,...

119
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,340
...is a much larger scale.

120
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,440
Only a few selected ones will be there.

121
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,040
I'm inviting you to be Xi Huang Jewellery's gemstone consultant.

122
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,520
Xi Huang Jewellery will give you 10% of the auction profit.

123
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,530
It's my way of thanking you.

124
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,680
Mr. Qin,I'm just the owner of a small antique shop.

125
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,800
I deal with bronze and porcelain everyday.

126
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,400
Being involved with the jade industry was merely coincidental.

127
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,040
I am not a good fit to be your consultant.

128
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,360
Thank you for thinking highly of me and for the invitation.

129
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,890
That's alright.

130
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,840
Before Xuanbing left Beijing, she told me this.

131
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,000
Even if I were to offer you 50% of the profit,...

132
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,600
...you will still reject me.

133
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,280
She said that you're interested in antiques and history...

134
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,000
...and you're not concerned with the money.

135
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,800
Has Xuanbing left Beijing?

136
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,680
She didn't tell me.

137
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,920
She's back in Kiev to handle some matters there...

138
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,120
...and to prepare for the Burmese auction.

139
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,480
Xuanbing is proud,she doesn't want you to feel bad.

140
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,240
She will never force you to do things that you don't like.

141
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,000
I was desperate and came over here to invite you.

142
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,960
This is not urgent.

143
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,800
I hope you will consider my offer.

144
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,080
We'll meet again.

145
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,080
Mr. Qin.

146
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,740
When are you leaving for Kiev?

147
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,600
So,it's a deal then. -Yes,it's a deal.

148
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,640
I'll call you. -Alright.

149
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,880
Well,I'll leave now. See you.

150
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,640
Take care. -Okay

151
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,920
Bye. -Bye.

152
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,660
Your allergy medication.

153
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,290
If I relied on you for medication, my face would've been rotten.

154
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,320
Who was that? He looks sneaky.

155
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,240
That was a client. -Client? Look at him.

156
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,480
He's been staring at you...

157
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,740
...and spoke so close into your ears.

158
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,360
What a jerk. -He likes me,alright?

159
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,680
He's treating me to dinner.

160
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,770
I always ask out you for dinner.

161
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,250
When you do it,it's annoying. -Annoying?

162
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,560
I don't know what you're talking about.

163
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,160
I only know that it's hard to reserve a table.

164
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,020
I reserved it one week in advance.

165
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,040
Feifei told me that you like eating steak.

166
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,980
The three times that you went,...

167
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,240
...you enjoyed it only twice.

168
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,840
That one time when they were out of steak,...

169
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,920
...you were so angry that you ate six ice balls.

170
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,960
Are you having fun with this?

171
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,000
Yes.

172
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,080
You're so shameless. -What do I care about that?

173
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,720
I only care for my loved one to be happy.

174
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,600
The restaurant imports steak twice a day.

175
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,360
If we go now,we'll get the second batch.

176
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,440
Why don't we go there now?

177
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,800
Let's go.

178
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,520
Feifei told me you liked this table.

179
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,660
It's strange that the restaurant's quite empty today.

180
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,440
You're right. There's almost no one here.

181
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,410
I can't believe you buy out the whole restaurant.

182
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,280
In the world where you and I are in,...

183
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,800
...there can be no space for anything else.

184
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,720
You have one chance tonight. What did you plan?

185
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,560
To love is to live. Where there's opportunity,...

186
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,920
...there'll be hope.

187
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,880
I hope you haven't forgotten about my pollen allergy.

188
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,680
Who buys flowers nowadays? It's tacky.

189
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,920
If you're putting on a music performance,forget it.

190
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,200
I loathe western music.

191
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,720
What a coincidence! I loathe western music,too.

192
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,280
We'll dive right into our meals. We don't need music.

193
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,440
I hope there's no cake because I'm on a diet.

194
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,160
I can't stand human-size plush toys,either.

195
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,440
I also hate all cartoons.

196
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,160
What's with you? -My neck feels uncomfortable.

197
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:14,720
Don't waste your time on me. I'm hard to get.

198
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,720
Just because one thing happened, it doesn't mean anything.

199
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,520
We're both adults. Don't be old-fashioned,...

200
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,120
...saying that you'll be responsible for that one night.

201
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,720
We'll just enjoy our meal and when we're done...

202
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,920
...we'll go back to being just friends.

203
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,620
That's good enough for me.

204
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,600
I don't need a friend. I have plenty already.

205
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,480
To be honest,I don't fall in love easily.

206
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,800
Miss Xiao Jia,I know that you're hard to get.

207
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,000
However,I will not give you up.

208
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,240
You're right,we're not old-fashioned...

209
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,280
...but I do believe in love.

210
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:32,640
I look forward to spend my whole life with someone.

211
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,360
I'm willing to take the day we had...

212
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,250
...and exchange it for a lifetime.

213
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,960
Besides,why can't you exchange one day for a lifetime?

214
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,160
A lifetime is made up of many days.

215
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,200
If it's a lifetime with someone I love,...

216
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,580
...I'm willing to do that.

217
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,440
Miss Xiao Jia.

218
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,680
I'll keep courting you.

219
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,200
I'll come up with endless ideas.

220
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,060
I'll work my brain,...

221
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,240
...my mouth...

222
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,000
...and I'll max out my credit cards,...

223
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,960
...until you say yes.

224
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,640
Medium well with black pepper sauce,did I get it right?

225
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,080
I'm sorry,I'll be back in ten minutes.

226
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,920
What? I need longer than that.

227
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,320
Xiao Rui.

228
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,720
It's that ring.

229
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,480
No,it's not..... -It's not what?

230
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,720
It's nothing. I'll come back in fifteen minutes.

231
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,840
Xiao Rui.

232
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,720
Huang Fuyun said that this is not his ring.

233
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,600
Take a look at this.

234
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,040
It looks alright but it's of subpar material.

235
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,320
This is an imitation ring.

236
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:54,680
It's fake? -It's a superior imitation.

237
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,680
People can't usually tell as it's a mix of Grade B and C.

238
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,120
Huang Fuyun.

239
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,520
Take back your grade B and C ring.

240
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,640
Jiajia!

241
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,680
So that's what it was. Keep your Grade B and C ring.

242
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,480
Zhuang Rui! I'll kill you!

243
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,320
I've worked so hard for this!

244
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,040
Old Mr. Gu said...

245
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,520
...that it's just a common jade.

246
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,120
It's strange...

247
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,800
...that Boss Yu and his men would risk their lives...

248
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,160
...for the Tamamoku jade.

249
00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:03,520
Did you find any clues?

250
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,640
Grandpa Gu was right.

251
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,160
The stone has a common shine to it.

252
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,440
Looking at its cut and patterns,...

253
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,440
...it should be from the Qin Dynasty.

254
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,960
There's not a shape that matches this on the database.

255
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:25,040
We won't be able to find out it's origin.

256
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,960
No matter if it's a small piece or the entire stone,...

257
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,290
...I don't see anything special about it.

258
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,420
Why would they want to steal this?

259
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,810
I should be asking you that.

260
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,840
You've been looking at it the whole day...

261
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,040
...yet you're asking me that question.

262
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,200
Why would you ask me to bring it here if you were not confident?

263
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,120
It's because we're going to Kiev tomorrow.

264
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,640
Kiev? What are you doing there?

265
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,640
What are we doing there? Why don't you ask him?

266
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,120
It's all because of Bingbing.

267
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,220
If you don't believe me, ask Xiao Fei. Am I right?

268
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:24,120
You want to get your girl but you foiled my plans.

269
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,080
How could you put relationship before friendship?

270
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,480
Zhuang Rui.

271
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,970
Are you messing with me?

272
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,680
I'm not. I wanted to take a look at the stone.

273
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,700
There is indeed nothing special.

274
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,280
Besides,why are you mad that I'm going to Kiev?

275
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,800
That's right. Why would you be mad?

276
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,960
I'm a model citizen. Don't I have any freedom?

277
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,360
You're right. What does that have to do with me?

278
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,800
You won't be here to create trouble. It's better for me.

279
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,640
Why are you mad,then?

280
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,240
I'm not mad.

281
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,370
You're saying that you're not mad?

282
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,200
I'm not mad!

283
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,520
Why does every girl who leaves this place...

284
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,000
...has to slam the door?

285
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,220
Can you please do something productive?

286
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,360
When have I done anything unproductive?

287
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,960
Am I right,Xiao Bai?

288
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,760
You're still packing?

289
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,720
What is this?

290
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,920
It looks hideous.

291
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,040
Let me help you.

292
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,520
This looks cool,doesn't it?

293
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,320
Try putting in on.

294
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,240
Let me tell you,us rich people have to pay attention to...

295
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,400
...our style.

296
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,600
It looks good on you.

297
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,520
What will you say now? You couldn't solve this case.

298
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,600
How can I help you now? You tell me.

299
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,000
Officer Ding,I..... -You can't handle this.

300
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,930
You made me.....

301
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,880
I can't help you anymore. You're on your own.

302
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,680
Just leave.

303
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,160
That's quick.

304
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,320
Xiao Ruirui!

305
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,760
I missed you!

306
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,840
Why took you so long to open the door?

307
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,480
Goodness.

308
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,720
Qin family is so wealthy...

309
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:56,160
...to give you this huge room. -We just parted ten minutes ago.

310
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,480
Qin family...

311
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,600
...gave you the presidential suite but we got the twin room.

312
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,120
Did you know when I started to miss you?

313
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,280
It's when I saw the small bed...

314
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,620
...and the bathroom with no bathtub.

315
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,080
Are you being serious? -Of course!

316
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,720
It's fine with me. I can sleep anywhere.

317
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,640
It's not fine with me.

318
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,800
That Qin Xuanbing is so mean.

319
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,760
How could you let her bully us?

320
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:42,600
I have a small bed and can't take a bubble bath.

321
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,360
What bath? -A bubble bath.

322
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,770
What do you want me to do?

323
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,320
You should let the two of us...

324
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,960
...to stay with you.

325
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,360
I'll take the couch.

326
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,040
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

327
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,760
We couldn't plan well due to our tight schedule.

328
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,460
I'll have them give you another room.

329
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:32,640
There's no need. Us rich people shouldn't spend money needlessly.

330
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,780
I want to stay with Zhuang Rui.

331
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,840
What about you? Are you staying here too?

332
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,480
He has returned our room keys. Besides,I don't mind the couch.

333
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,880
I can also become your personal bodyguard.

334
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,840
Would you mind lending Zhuang Rui to me for the day?

335
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,840
No.

336
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,120
What is it for?

337
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,040
What is it? -Event organiser,Fang Zhenghua.

338
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,480
He's a family friend.

339
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,560
Zheng family is in the freight transportation industry.

340
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,000
He is well connected.

341
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,880
My father wants you to meet him.

342
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,040
I told you.

343
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,440
You can't have him!

344
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,840
Doesn't it say 8 o'clock on the card?

345
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,489
Why are we leaving now?

346
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,560
Is the place far?

347
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,760
It's an out-of-town medieval manor.

348
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,360
It's not too far,...

349
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,810
..but we're not in a rush. We have time to prepare.

350
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,080
What is there to prepare?

351
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,240
This way,please.

352
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,360
You look good in that.

353
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,580
This is my favourite restaurant in Kiev.

354
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,440
They have some unique dishes that are delicious.

355
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,280
The dishes in Kiev look roughly-made...

356
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,200
...but they don't taste so bad.

357
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,000
Didn't we agree on me paying the bill?

358
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,000
Didn't we agree that I'm paying?

359
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,760
As your local guide,let me show you our hospitality.

360
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,760
Don't say that. You've shown me enough.

361
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,760
Let me pay for it.

362
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,010
Alright.

363
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,240
There you are.

364
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,600
Feifei?

365
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,520
Why did you come here?

366
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,080
Why can't I be here? You don't own Kiev.

367
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,160
I thought you had urgent matters in Kiev.

368
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:35,600
Looks like you're having some drinks...

369
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,770
...and doing shopping.

370
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,000
This dish looks delicious.

371
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,760
Please have some.

372
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,560
Miss Qin,your perfume smells unique.

373
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,400
What brand do you use? -You really think so?

374
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:06,920
I don't use perfume. It could be the incense that I use at home.

375
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,240
I like the smell of incense.

376
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,720
If you love them, I can give you some.

377
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,720
No,thank you.

378
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,680
I don't like smells that can mask someone's true identity.

379
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,200
If you didn't like it, why did you ask about it?

380
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,800
Ms. Qin,weren't you expanding your family business...

381
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,320
...in China? Why are you suddenly in Kiev?

382
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,620
Officer Miao seems to be concerned about me.

383
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,640
I have some social gatherings here.

384
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,800
I brought Zhuang Rui along...

385
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,160
...so that he can widen his connections.

386
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,440
There'll be a wine meet tonight.

387
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,640
Why don't Officer Miao join us?

388
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,000
No need,I don't drink.

389
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,360
Three bottles of Vodka. The total is RUB 90,000.

390
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,490
Would you like to pay in cash or by card?

391
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,720
What did she say?

392
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,720
Officer Miao ordered three bottles of vodka.

393
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,840
I thought you didn't like to drink.

394
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,320
Why would you buy so many?

395
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,880
Zhuang Rui,you don't know this.

396
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,440
The vodka here is the best in the world.

397
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,280
Even if you don't drink,it will change when you get here.

398
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,930
The three bottles of vodka.

399
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,800
How can they be so expensive?

400
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,840
I'll pay for it.

401
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,160
You just arrived in Kiev.

402
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,600
You must be here for an official mission.

403
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,260
Can you drink while on the job?

404
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,090
What's it to you?

405
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,800
I would like to cancel my order.

406
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,680
I'll put them back later.

407
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,920
What happened to you?

408
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,100
Did something happen?

409
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,570
It's none of your business.

410
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,960
Look at you. What happened to you?

411
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,400
I told you,leave me alone!

412
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,770
I'm no longer a police officer and we're not related in work.

413
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,960
We're not in a relationship so you're nobody to me.

414
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,240
We're just strangers to each other.

415
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,040
How's that?

416
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,080
It's just that.....

417
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,520
Did you lose your job? How can this be?

418
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,050
I'm just plain unlucky.

419
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:50,120
I sneaked evidence out the station and it was stolen. That's all.

420
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,260
Didn't you say you informed them about that?

421
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,720
Zhuang Rui,that has nothing to do with you.

422
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:57,960
She's right.

423
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,160
It has nothing to do with you.

424
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,330
Don't say that. I have something to do with it.

425
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,130
About this.....

426
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,320
What do you have to do with it?

427
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,160
Indeed,it's because of me...

428
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,120
...that you lost your job.

429
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,040
Give me a moment to think.

430
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,780
How about this?

431
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,010
Until you find a new job,...

432
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,440
...why don't you become my bodyguard?
