1
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,000
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 36

3
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,120
Xiaorui,are you up?

4
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,280
What's with these photos?

5
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,480
These are Feng Quan's photos.

6
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,720
It's nothing. Why are your eyes red?

7
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,040
Don't lie to me. I know about Feng Quan.

8
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,360
I know they say that you're Feng Quan reincarnated.

9
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,800
Yes.

10
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,920
I read books and study photos...

11
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,720
...to understand my past and current life.

12
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,000
You were never wrong in stone gambling.

13
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:38,120
Do you have an all-seeing eye like Feng Quan?

14
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,880
Xiaorui,I'm not a child.

15
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,160
We've been through many things together.

16
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,840
Starting business,going on adventures and living together.

17
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,320
You don't think I'm worthy to share secrets with?

18
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,500
You don't trust me?

19
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,000
No,I trust you.

20
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,780
You're my best friend and a brother to me.

21
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,640
Then you'll have to tell me the truth today.

22
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,970
What is your relationship with Feng Quan?

23
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,600
Is your body deteriorating?

24
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,720
Yes. -You...

25
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,450
...really have supernatural powers?

26
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,560
When did it start? Since you were young?

27
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,420
Since my injury from the pawn shop incident.

28
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,600
Why didn't you tell me?

29
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,480
I was complaining all day long.

30
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,980
I blamed God for being unfair.

31
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,600
All the good things happen on you.

32
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,480
Are you happy now?

33
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,400
All that I know comes with a price.

34
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,450
You.....

35
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,320
You lost your sight in Phakant.

36
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,360
You also lost your hearing in Inner Mongolia. Is it true?

37
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:30,120
Will you really be as is written in the ancient book,...

38
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,800
...lose your five senses? Like in the movies?

39
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,560
Don't be silly.

40
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,120
All of you said that dinner earlier was salty.

41
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,159
I tasted nothing.

42
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,000
Ancient medical knowledge is not comparable to modern medicine.

43
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,120
Your symptoms are side effects of your eye injury.

44
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:01,560
You're just momentarily injured.

45
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,200
You'll be cured.

46
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,640
I hope I'll be lucky enough to live another 3 to 5 years.

47
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,160
Xiaorui!

48
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,850
I've read in foreign medical books...

49
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,760
...that external trauma will cause a loss of vision.

50
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,480
My university professor and I will find a cure for you.

51
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,360
Fei!

52
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,440
Can you fix your habit...

53
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,440
...of walking without a sound? How much did you hear?

54
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,250
When you saw through the landmine in Phakant,...

55
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,730
...I had my suspicions.

56
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,400
This is huge. Why didn't you tell me?

57
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,140
It was mere speculation so I didn't think much of it.

58
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,400
Xiaorui,don't worry. You'll be fine.

59
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,440
Feng Quan lived thousands of year ago.

60
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,040
When people caught the flu back then,they died.

61
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,810
Medical knowledge is so advanced now.

62
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,280
All your symptoms will surely be cured.

63
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,920
I swear on my expertise, just leave this to me.

64
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,080
Sure. As long as your medicine...

65
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,450
...taste better than the dishes you make.

66
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,240
Xiaorui,be honest. Does it look like...

67
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,020
...I've given everything to you?

68
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,120
You're crazy.

69
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,580
I was worried for nothing.

70
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:03,980
Zhuang Rui.

71
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,380
I know you don't want to see me.

72
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,200
I'll never pay back for what I've done to you.

73
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,880
If there's nothing else, I'll leave now.

74
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,440
Wait. I know where to find Nakagawa Ryosuke.

75
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,180
How did you know I was looking for him?

76
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,960
Are you following me?

77
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,380
I just want to help you.

78
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,880
No need. The police will investigate this.

79
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,600
Miss Qin,you don't need to go the trouble.

80
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,600
I have Nakagawa Ryosuke's private plane's schedule.

81
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,480
Do you want it?

82
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,240
Kiev?

83
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,360
Victor comes from a family of collectors in Kiev.

84
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,160
He runs a family business, the Zeha Renko Museum.

85
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,890
He went to university with Nakagawa Ryosuke.

86
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,800
Isn't this Nakagawa.....

87
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,920
Nakagawa Yohei.

88
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,060
Xiaozhao has confirmed this.

89
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,800
Nakagawa Yohei is Nakagawa Ryosuke's father.

90
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,200
He founded Nakagawa Corporation. The Victors and Nakagawas...

91
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,460
...have a close relationship through business dealings.

92
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,840
So Nakagawa Ryosuke must be meeting Victor in Kiev.

93
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,560
With the relationship that they have,...

94
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,690
...Nakagawa Ryosuke will not miss the 100th year anniversary.

95
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,160
If Nakagawa Ryosuke is Grandfather Gu's murderer,...

96
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,820
...then he's a human garbage.

97
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,370
Does this makes sense? He's having fun after the murder.

98
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,840
Zhuang Rui.

99
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,760
Are you all right?

100
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,900
It's nothing. I didn't have a good sleep last night.

101
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,920
Xiaorui,you should go to bed if you're feeling tired.

102
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,380
Your health is important.

103
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,680
Will you have an early death like Feng Quan?

104
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,380
Maybe I'm luckier than him and will live 3 to 5 years longer.

105
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,760
Let's not look at it anymore.

106
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,200
I'm sleepy,too. Let's go to bed.

107
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,210
Pengfei sent a message.

108
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,120
He's helped Xiaoyu manage Grandfather Gu's funeral.

109
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,520
He asked you not to worry.

110
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,680
Feifei,how much does Victor know about Tamamoku Stone?

111
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,880
Do you think they might be accomplices?

112
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,120
We have little evidence so it's hard to make conclusions.

113
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,970
We're on the disadvantage.

114
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,210
We're in Kiev,a place where none of us are familiar with.

115
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,920
Nakagawa Ryosuke could've disappeared before we find him.

116
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,320
Victor is only chance for breakthrough.

117
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,640
Since this situation is in a mess,...

118
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,200
...let's strike first and get it done with.

119
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,360
Okay,let's go through our act. -Again?

120
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,850
It's not the same this time.

121
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,640
After Hu Wen's rescue mission and negotiation with Duwa,...

122
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,360
...you have officially become version 3.0.

123
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,200
Let's talk character profiles.

124
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,280
You are a Chinese tycoon.

125
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,680
Remember,all your movements...

126
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,320
...must say, "I'm rich,don't stop me."

127
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,640
"I have money to spend."

128
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:47,640
You will be a rude,ignorant and uneducated pretty face.

129
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,730
Your only goal in life is to squander the tycoon's money.

130
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,210
I don't like my character profile!

131
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,600
Why is my character rude and ignorant?

132
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,120
I can also be a demure,elegant...

133
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,460
...and talented lady from a good family.

134
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,560
I will be...

135
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,480
...a tall,reliable,...

136
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,680
...charming,handsome and capable...

137
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,000
...well-known special assistant.

138
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,900
What's there to be proud of? You're just a follower.

139
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,080
I'm a special assistant. -A follower.

140
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,480
Special assistant! -Follower!

141
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,500
That's enough.

142
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,520
So what is our main task?

143
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,200
We're rich.

144
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,520
Of course we should act like the rich do.

145
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,620
My dress is not the red carpet. Are you blind?

146
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,240
You're a demure and elegant lady.

147
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,730
Let's go.

148
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,640
Welcome,ladies and gentlemen,...

149
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,760
...the 100th anniversary of the museum named after Mr. Z.

150
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,800
I'm Victor,the 3rd generation of museum curator.

151
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,640
100 years ago,our museum...

152
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,480
...was founded by my grandfather Daniel Kharenko.

153
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,160
My father took over the business...

154
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,600
...and now as you see, it's handed over to me.

155
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,960
There are over 1,000 display items in our museum.

156
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,280
They are collected from all over the world.

157
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,920
Some display items are only available in our museum.

158
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,440
We try to make your visit to our museum an interesting one.

159
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,100
We're hope you're excited...

160
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,520
...about the 3 exhibition halls in the museum.

161
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,840
We have the history hall, the exhibits hall...

162
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,760
...and the contemporary art gallery.

163
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,560
We'll buy this.

164
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,640
This is...

165
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:07,160
...a jade hairpin from the Qing Dynasty.

166
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,800
This jade hairpin is indeed a hairpiece from the Qing Dynasty.

167
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,000
I like it.

168
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,880
Since it's from China, let's buy it and give it away.

169
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,829
Madam,I agree.

170
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,200
This should be a lotus flower ceramic.

171
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,280
We'll take this. -All right,I'll pack it up.

172
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,320
This..... -Pack this up.

173
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,560
All right.

174
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,880
I know this.

175
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,320
It's bronze ware from China. I've read about them in school.

176
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,920
Special assistant, tell them that I want this.

177
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,440
We'll take this,too.

178
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,420
I'm sorry. This display item is not for sale.

179
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,960
Madam,this is a display item.

180
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,000
It's not for sale? -Not for sale?

181
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,160
The ones in front are for sale. Why isn't this for sale?

182
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
They're just not selling it. -I still want it!

183
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,100
You're a demure and elegant lady.

184
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,240
I want it badly.

185
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:43,960
Let's go.

186
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,000
I used to think that riches don't always bring happiness.

187
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,730
I realize after today that being rich does make me happy.

188
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,720
If you marry Mr. Zhuang, you'll immediately be rich.

189
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,880
Him? Who knows which rich lady he has his mind on.

190
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,840
Why are you acting up? Play the part of a rich couple.

191
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,240
A hidden Gem from Qing Dynasty. The Flying Double Fish.

192
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,120
It has the classic flower embossment and looks thick.

193
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,280
The lines are smooth and its edges cut clear.

194
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,080
Sir,...

195
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,020
...you know a lot. You must be an expert on antiquities.

196
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,320
This is the famous Chinese tycoon,Mr. Zhuang.

197
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,200
He is indeed an expert on hidden treasures.

198
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,640
However,this is not a good day for a talk.

199
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,600
Mr. and Madam Zhuang do not wish to be interrupted.

200
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,290
Pardon my rudeness.

201
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,680
I'm Victor,the museum's curator. How may I help you?

202
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,120
Mr. Victor, please pardon my ignorance.

203
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,640
This is Mr. and Madam Zhuang.

204
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,600
I'm their assistant and interpreter.

205
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,760
From Mr. Zhuang's explanation,...

206
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,560
...you must be an excellent collector.

207
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,280
It's just hobby. I only know a thing or two.

208
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,840
Mr. Victor, you speak fluent Mandarin.

209
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,970
It's just hobby. I only know a thing or two.

210
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,480
Mr. Victor, I have a question for you.

211
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,120
Hidden treasures from the Qing Dynasty are rarely seen...

212
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,400
...and are losing circulation.

213
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,860
What method and channel did you use to obtain these treasures?

214
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,040
I want to make sure...

215
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,330
...to avoid any trouble in the future.

216
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,720
Mr. Zhuang,you can be rest assured...

217
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,880
...as our museum has over 100 years of history.

218
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,880
All our exhibits are obtained legally.

219
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,930
So there wouldn't be a problem.

220
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,520
This painting is a fake!

221
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,120
Please excuse me.

222
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,840
Could you tell this is a fake?

223
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,240
I had no idea.

224
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,940
I can't believe an esteemed museum would display a fake painting.

225
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,200
This is a fake. It's not good,all right?

226
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,800
Do you work here? Come.

227
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,680
I can't believe this.

228
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,720
An esteemed museum displaying a forged artwork...

229
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,520
...on its 100th anniversary exhibition.

230
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,280
Sir,you claim this painting to be a fake.

231
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,160
What's the proof? -That's easy.

232
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,120
Have you watched Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?

233
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,400
One of the turtles is called Raphael.

234
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,360
Of course,Raphael is also a famous painter.

235
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,040
He drew this painting called The Canigiani Holy Family.

236
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,920
This painting here looks like it but it is not.

237
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,960
The real painting is at The State Hermitage Museum.

238
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,220
So this painting is a fake.

239
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,800
Besides,can't you tell that the artwork was poorly done?

240
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,480
The child's eyes...

241
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,000
...were painted wrongly as they're looking upwards.

242
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,160
The eyes are not even painted well. This is a joke.

243
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,920
Pardon me,sir. The Canigiani Holy Family...

244
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,040
...was loaned from The State Hermitage Museum.

245
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,040
We have proof of documentation.

246
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,240
The use of perspective and reduction with a balance...

247
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,160
...is what sets Raphael apart from the rest in Florence.

248
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:57,720
Besides,the restoration of The Canigiani Holy Family...

249
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,520
...was indeed poorly done but it's precisely this...

250
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,320
...that proof its originality.

251
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,200
I don't understand what you said. However,it looks like...

252
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,920
...you're a curator or a staff.

253
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,380
You must be good at art appreciation,right?

254
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,200
I bought 2 paintings this morning.

255
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,960
Could you determine its authenticity? If they're real,...

256
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,960
...I'll display them here for free.

257
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,400
If they're fake,it shows that I can't appreciate art.

258
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,360
I made a mistake and will eat the paintings,okay?

259
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,640
I'm more than happy to do that.

260
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,520
It's chinese calligraphy.

261
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,840
Did you see him smelling it? What is he doing?

262
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,580
From what I see,...

263
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,320
...whether is's the inscription of letters...

264
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,440
...or the material used, I find no problem.

265
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,920
The details are well-done.

266
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,060
However,I can't be too sure of it.

267
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,800
Does anyone want to have a look at this?

268
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,560
I'll have a look. May I have the magnifying glass?

269
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,840
I didn't expect to meet a fellow Chinese here.

270
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,320
Where are you from? -Hunnan.

271
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,280
What a coincidence! I'm from Harbin.

272
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,400
We're from the same hometown. -The same hometown.

273
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,210
You look professional.

274
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,560
Sir.

275
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,720
Did you pay a lot for these 2 paintings?

276
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,080
It's not much.

277
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,560
It's a pity that they're both fake.

278
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,800
Fake?

279
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,880
Impossible. Did you know how much I paid?

280
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,130
How could you say they're fake?

281
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,760
First,let's look at Zheng Banqiao's work.

282
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,400
Mr. Zheng Banqiao lost his wife at 1731.

283
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,760
The Moon on the West River was written in 1735.

284
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,000
This painting is dated date on King Yongzheng's 11th-year reign.

285
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,040
Which is 1733.

286
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,720
How can a future poem existed in 1733?

287
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,620
Maybe he was groggy from sleep...

288
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,960
...and wrote the wrong year.

289
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,400
Fine,even if the date is wrong, the painting must be good,right?

290
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,960
If even the date is wrong, what more the painting?

291
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,290
Even the canvas is fake.

292
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,440
Young man,you seem to know a lot.

293
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,400
Take a look at this painting. Is there any problem?

294
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,080
This painting...

295
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,560
...is The Promenade by Marc Chagall.

296
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,840
It represents a loving and happy couple.

297
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,000
At the bottom right, the date written is...

298
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,160
...1945.

299
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,080
I remember that Mr. Marc Chagall lost his wife in 1944.

300
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,240
How could he have painted such a happy painting?

301
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,160
If I'm not mistaken, The Promenade...

302
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,120
...was painted in 1918.

303
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,400
So,both paintings are fake.

304
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,760
Mr. Victor knew they were fake...

305
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,140
...but he didn't want to put you in the spot as a curator.

306
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,640
Great! -There's some results.

307
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,240
Brother,didn't you say you'll eat your paintings? It's showtime.

308
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,160
Why bother your own countrymen,right?

309
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,080
Besides,what do you know?

310
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,340
How did you figure out they were fake?

311
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,640
Who would remember things that happened in 1900s?

312
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,200
Maybe he had other wives? Who knows?

313
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,360
You're tourists so focus on that.

314
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,920
Young people,don't interfere in adult's business.

315
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,240
You look like a singer.

316
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,720
The one who sang Snow on the Northern Frontier.

317
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,600
His wife died! -I didn't know.

318
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,040
How could you write the wrong dates?

319
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,200
What's so funny?

320
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,840
Mr. Zhuang, thank you for your help.

321
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,480
Would you like to have some coffee with me?

322
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,080
Why not?

323
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,760
Thank you for your help.

324
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,940
This is a Victorian pocket watch from my personal collection.

325
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,560
It's a small token of gratitude.

326
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,800
You don't have to do this.

327
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,500
I didn't do it for a reward.

328
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,200
However, if you want to thank me,...

329
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,440
...I do have a favour to ask.

330
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,200
Go ahead. -He meant to ask,...

331
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,560
...since we bought a lot,...

332
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,880
...could you give us a discount?

333
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,400
So that was it?

334
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,970
I thought Mr. Zhuang wasn't here for the antiquities...

335
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,800
...but for Nakagawa Ryosuke.

336
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,200
Yes.

337
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,850
I..... You.....

338
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,240
Yes.

339
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,440
I came here to ask about Nakagawa Ryosuke's location.

340
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,960
Would you happen to know?

341
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,720
He did come here.

342
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,280
Could you give me his address and contact number?

343
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,240
I'd love to help.

344
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,640
However,I've promised my friend to not expose his whereabouts.

345
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,400
Nakagawa Ryosuke successfully bid on a Tamamoku stone in Yunnan.

346
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,400
Did you know that?

347
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,700
Mr. Victor,...

348
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,240
...lives are at stake. Please tell us.

349
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,160
I'm sorry but we're closing.

350
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,920
I have matters to attend to. Please,you may leave.

351
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,250
Is the Tamamoku stone here?

352
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,600
Please leave.

353
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,800
Zhuang Rui impressed me. I didn't think he'd be here this soon.

354
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,440
Mr. Victor will handle this.

355
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,900
If I had known you and Victor were not going to talk well,...

356
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,800
...I would have insisted on the discount.

357
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,480
You insisted on directing it. What now?

358
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,600
Listen here. Follower,you're fired.

359
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,900
What did you make me wear? -I'm a special assistant.

360
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,600
Being able to dress you up...

361
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,280
...is miracle.

362
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,560
Demure and elegant.

363
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,080
You have to maintain it even if we're not acting anymore.

364
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,480
Although I didn't get Nakagawa Ryosuke's location,...

365
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,760
...at least I know the Tamamoku stone is with Victor.

366
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,700
Besides,I'm sure that...

367
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,640
...as long the stone is there, Nakagawa Ryosuke will appear.

368
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,960
We can't just wait and do nothing.

369
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,720
What happens if he doesn't appear?

370
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,720
We need Victor to tell us.

371
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,600
Victor is a direct person.

372
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,290
Perhaps we need to be more direct with him.

373
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,880
We'll negotiate with him. -Negotiate?

374
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,620
Do we have any leverage? What good will negotiation do?

375
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,920
The red diamond sceptre on this flyer...

376
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,920
...is the museum's treasure. I didn't see it earlier.

377
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:30,150
Yes. Maybe they didn't put it on display.

378
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,880
Look!

379
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:42,190
One month earlier,there was a break-in at museum at midnight.

380
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,280
However,when the police arrived,...

381
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,400
...the museum announced...

382
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,400
...that all exhibits are intact and safe.

383
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,659
The incident was left just like that.

384
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,360
There was a break-in but nothing was taken?

385
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,520
Don't you find it odd?

386
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,920
Could it be that something was taken...

387
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,620
...but Victor wanted to protect the museum's image...

388
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,880
...and covered it up?

389
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,040
The red diamond sceptre!

390
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,560
Everything that happened today weren't an accident.

391
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,620
This must have been planned for long.

392
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,520
We must find out what it is.

393
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,320
Yes,the man earlier has a partner.

394
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,800
I saw a man who kept taking photographs.

395
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,040
Photographing Victor? Why?

396
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,840
This is the most famous bar in Kiev's.

397
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,240
I heard that you two met here before.

398
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,600
Let's reminisce that good day.

399
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,720
What good day? That was a nightmare.

400
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,840
What nightmare? Stop talking in riddles.

401
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,560
Let's go. I'm starving.

402
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:56,960
Let's go.

403
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,760
Is this the restaurant that you mentioned?

404
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,650
This restaurant is expensive.

405
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,600
Why is it these dishes again?

406
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,760
Why? You don't like it. We'll order again.

407
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,960
No need. These are the classic dishes here.

408
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,120
Order 3 bottles of vodka.

409
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,850
You're a married woman. Why drink so much?

410
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,240
I'm in a good mood to reminisce the past.

411
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,570
Are you worried the burly men would come give you a toast?

412
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,120
Dear friends,a toast to you.

413
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,800
Brother,let me introduce you.

414
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,360
Those are members of our rider's club.

415
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,800
That is a pastry chef and that is a bartender.

416
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:21,680
Welcome to Kiev. Cheers!

417
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,720
Here,cheers!

418
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,860
Let's go. Zhuang Rui,come on.

419
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:02,000
We are the champions,my friend.

420
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,360
We'll keep on fighting til the end.

421
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:15,200
We are the champions.

422
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,640
We are the champions. We are the champions.

423
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,800
Are you drunk? -I'm not drunk. I'm good.

424
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,400
Since you have no job,...

425
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,120
...why don't you become my bodyguard?

426
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,080
Bodyguard?

427
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,880
Don't you have Pengfei already?

428
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,020
It's better to be safe.

429
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,970
Isn't it better to have more security?

430
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,640
Are you sure?

431
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,700
Zhuang Rui.

432
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,280
Could you tell me,...

433
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,420
...what's with your eyes?

434
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,800
My eyes...

435
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,600
...are all-seeing.

436
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,940
However,there are some things that I can't see.

437
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,040
Just like.....

438
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,640
Just like how I can't tell if you're angry.

439
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,240
When did I get angry?

440
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,840
You like to get angry.

441
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,040
I don't have a good temper like you.

442
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,840
It's not about having a good temper.

443
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,680
What are you trying to hide?

444
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,880
You're using your bad temper to hide...

445
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,120
...something.
