1
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,500
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,000
Episode 51

3
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:45,039
Qin Haoran,follow me.

4
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,080
Put your knives down! Don't move!

5
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,000
Put your knives down.

6
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,470
Okay,I'll follow you.

7
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,680
Don't move! Put your gun down.

8
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,120
Put it down! -Sir,get in the car!

9
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,200
Let her go.

10
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,840
Qin Haoran,let her go!

11
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,130
Don't come near.

12
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,480
Start the car!

13
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,320
Are you okay?

14
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,680
How is it?

15
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,340
The police has controlled Xi Huang Jewellery but Qin Haoran escaped.

16
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,400
Xi Huang Jewellery's been seized. As long as the jade is safe,...

17
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,560
...the police handle the rest.

18
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,040
Then,...

19
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,220
...what about you?

20
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,440
I am guilty.

21
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,180
I have been the young lady of the Qin family for 20 years.

22
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,360
Maybe it's good to move elsewhere to think...

23
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,620
...about my identity.

24
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,920
Are you all right?

25
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,420
Why would I not be fine?

26
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,960
How can you say that? If I hadn't made it in time,...

27
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,200
...I don't know what will happen to you.

28
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,920
Really? Actually, you don't need to worry.

29
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,159
Mr. Nakagawa and I pretended to go against each other.

30
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,240
Actually,we want to distract Qin Haoran...

31
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,440
...and stop his vigilance.

32
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,520
Qin Xuanbing and Kojima went to steal the pen drive.

33
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,980
Nakagawa's followers were there should anything goes wrong.

34
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,680
You are considered lucky this time.

35
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,240
Yes.

36
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,760
Right,...

37
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,360
...this. -What is this?

38
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,770
I undo this paper crane and couldn't fold it back.

39
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,880
Why did you undo it?

40
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,610
Make another one for me. -I don't know how.

41
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,810
I really don't know. -I don't care.

42
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,040
I don't want that.

43
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,840
Qin Haoran escaped with...

44
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,760
...his followers.

45
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,360
I guess that his next move...

46
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,040
...will be to use all means to take the jade.

47
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,160
When you keep the jade,...

48
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,160
...I will send people to open the 3 safes.

49
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,360
If they don't receive the news,...

50
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,280
...it takes time to find the location of the safe,...

51
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,800
...maybe this can hold them off.

52
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,080
We can't hold them off for long. -You are saying that.....

53
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,960
Since Qin Haoran...

54
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,360
...is certain that the jade I have was fake,...

55
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,480
...it means he knows well...

56
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,880
...about the 3 locations of the jade.

57
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,040
If so,...

58
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,660
...since he cannot protect himself now,...

59
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,970
...if I'm not mistaken,...

60
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,300
...he will take the jade by force.

61
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,000
What's more, it will be done tonight.

62
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,760
Then,let him take it.

63
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,700
We will see whether...

64
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,330
...he is capable or not.

65
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,480
Manager!

66
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,800
Do you know what's the time now? Our clients are complaining.

67
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,280
Inform your boss that we will cancel the contract if late again.

68
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,960
Yes. We will be careful next time.

69
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,040
There's no next time. Hurry up. -Yes.

70
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,960
Yes,okay.

71
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,280
This is an old safe. Can you open it?

72
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,880
I'll try.

73
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:53,880
It's open.

74
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,320
Open it.

75
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,370
What? Why is there another one? -Boss,...

76
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,360
...this is the real password lock.

77
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,040
The outside one is a trap.

78
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,840
Once someone opens it, the police will be here.

79
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,570
What should we do now,big brother?

80
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,880
Follow the original plan. -Yes.

81
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,650
Understood.

82
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,890
Hello,Zhao.

83
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,560
Hello,Sister Fei. Brother Gui is here.

84
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,400
Bring someone to the room and check whether the item is safe.

85
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,530
I'll be there now. -Yes,I understand.

86
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,000
Officer Miao! They went over there.

87
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,690
Don't worry. It's still here. Zhuang Rui and sister were right.

88
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,520
Hello,sister. Our colleagues have found that it is Brother Gui.

89
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,440
It's him. Have you find out Qin Haoran's location?

90
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,770
All the important information are with Brother Gui now.

91
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,530
I will arrest him for sure this time. How's your side?

92
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
It's safe for now.

93
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,760
Wait,there's someone there. I'll go and look.

94
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,220
Be careful.

95
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,680
Okay,yes,I know.

96
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,200
Qin Haoran's followers opened the emergency exit and ran.

97
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,530
The jade is still there.

98
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,160
I already said that if he wants to steal,...

99
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,730
...he must have the capability to do so first.

100
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,440
Hello,sir.

101
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,060
They are really stubborn.

102
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,320
They must never thought that we are luring them away.

103
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,520
Sir,our men should have obtained the jade.

104
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,600
Okay.

105
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,240
Remove the obstacle.

106
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,640
Yes.

107
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,880
Boss,the jade is with us.

108
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,760
Sir,everything went smoothly.

109
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,050
I have already led them to the suburbs.

110
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,810
Even if they realise it, they cannot make it back in time.

111
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,320
Very good. You just need to throw off Miao Feifei.

112
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,240
Don't worry. I have sent men to fetch you.

113
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,360
Drive forward 300 meters. There's an intersection.

114
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,880
Left or right?

115
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,480
Towards..... -Left.

116
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,200
Then,continue onwards.

117
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,780
The men who will fetch you are already there.

118
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,360
Speed up. The police is catching up to you.

119
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,560
Director Qin,it's a dead end with nowhere to go.

120
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,680
I know.

121
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,240
Can you hear me?

122
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,840
Wake up!

123
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,640
Hurry and call the ambulance!

124
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,200
Yes. -Can you hear me?

125
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,120
Can you hear me? Hang in there. The ambulance will be here soon.

126
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,320
Felton Hotel.

127
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,560
8322.

128
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,920
Qin Haoran kills.....

129
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,040
Wake up! Hang in there!

130
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,400
Hang in there! Wake up!

131
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,600
The ambulance will be here soon!

132
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,000
Xiaorui,there's good news!

133
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,580
Feifei arrested Brother Gui.

134
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,010
The police are now heading to the hotel to arrest Qin Haoran.

135
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,740
Mr. Zhuang's plan is indeed perfect.

136
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,640
Qin Haoran thought he is luring everyone out to take the jade.

137
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,240
He doesn't know that the real jade never left Kiev.

138
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,800
His plan to steal this time only reveals his whereabouts.

139
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,280
He provides the opportunity for the police to arrest him.

140
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,220
Thanks,Mr. Nakagawa.

141
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,200
Right,where is Xiaozhao? -Don't worry.

142
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,680
They have worn the bulletproof vest as you suggested.

143
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,010
He only suffered some external injuries.

144
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,730
That's good.

145
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,960
Our plan with the police this time has succeeded.

146
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,120
I feel like hanging a banner at home. Where should I hang it?

147
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,480
I hope we can...

148
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,760
...arrest Qin Haoran this time.

149
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:28,920
Useless!

150
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,120
Hello. -Old Ma.

151
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,840
I have the jade...

152
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,840
...but it's a fake.

153
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,130
It's likely that...

154
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,930
...they never brought the real one into the country.

155
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,960
No,Old Ma.

156
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,820
You have to help me.

157
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,920
I beg you.

158
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,760
You must help me.

159
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,820
Sister,...

160
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,000
...according to Brother Gui, Qin Haoran ordered the murders.

161
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,120
So,we cannot relax right now.

162
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,800
We have to follow up. -Okay.

163
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,200
Thank you for the hard work,everyone.

164
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,800
The squadron says they don't have enough people.

165
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,880
Follow them to Xi Huang Jewellery.

166
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:44,920
Yes.

167
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,880
How is it,Zhao?

168
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,890
We have retrieved the recordings along the route...

169
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,880
...and found that 3 of them were destroyed.

170
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,660
The technical team is now carrying out emergency repairs.

171
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,320
Increase number of people and put more efforts to search.

172
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,480
Retrieve recordings from the malls and petrol stations.

173
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,140
Time range is between 1 a.m. to 3 a.m. yesterday.

174
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,200
Observe all passing vehicles. -I understand.

175
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,420
Right,sister.

176
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,920
Second team has a damaged artifact.

177
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,280
It's an important evidence. Uncle De could repair it.

178
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,120
Your boyfriend know Uncle De. -Sure,I'll ask him personally.

179
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:34,720
Okay.

180
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,200
Who is my boyfriend? Be careful, I may injure your mouth.

181
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,080
Do you feel better? The doctor called me to...

182
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,880
...ask you to rest for a few days.

183
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,240
Worry about me? I'm strong and tall.

184
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,780
Don't worry,I'm fine.

185
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,960
It's because of you that we can predict Qin Haoran's moves.

186
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,480
We didn't lose the jade and even arrested his loyal follower.

187
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,760
We also obtained many clues.

188
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,810
Didn't Qin Haoran run away?

189
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,080
Don't worry. I will arrest him.

190
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,840
Stop bothering about me. What about your eyes?

191
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,160
I'm fine. -How is it? Does it feel painful?

192
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,200
I'm fine. -Really?

193
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,640
Uncle De! Uncle De,it's me.

194
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,160
Can you be a consultant for Officer Miao's case?

195
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,920
I have a cold. I'm afraid you will be infected.

196
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,040
Put the information at the door. I'll take it in a while.

197
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:05,800
Then,let us visit you. -It's all right. I'm fine.

198
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,800
Don't worry,it's nothing.

199
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,120
Uncle De.

200
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,920
Let's go. We will come again next time.

201
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,280
You're good at acting,Uncle De.

202
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,520
I've forgotten since when I started to act.

203
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,960
Stop acting. Follow me.

204
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,480
I'm serious.

205
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,720
What is it? -It doesn't feel right.

206
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,200
I feel that...

207
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,970
...Uncle De seems to want to chase us away.

208
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,440
You think too much.

209
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,520
No,he was never like this before.

210
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,160
Isn't Uncle De old? It's normal to fall sick.

211
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,980
He's afraid to infect you. Isn't your body weak?

212
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:28,880
Let's go.

213
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,760
Hello. -Zhuang Rui,listen carefully.

214
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,920
Uncle De is with me.

215
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,080
Bring Zhuang Qiming's notebook in exchange for him.

216
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,600
Remember,you must come alone.

217
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,720
What did you say? Hello!

218
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,520
He said Uncle De is with him. -Who?

219
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,610
It's not right. Let's go back and look.

220
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,520
Why is the door open?

221
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,240
Uncle De! -Uncle De!

222
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,160
Uncle De!

223
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,960
You bring Grandfather Zhuang's notebook tomorrow...

224
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,280
...and find Qin Haoran so that he will not hurt Uncle De.

225
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,600
After Uncle De is safe,...

226
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,260
...we will move in to control the situation.

227
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,880
Trust me,it will be fine. -Okay,I trust you.

228
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,360
Qin Haoran will receive his retribution for this.

229
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,240
Sister Fei,what do we do?

230
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,730
After making sure the hostage is safe,move in immediately.

231
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,060
Did you bring the item?

232
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,240
Let him go first. You will then have the item.

233
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,200
You aren't qualified to negotiate with me.

234
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,480
Both of us will not benefit from dragging this.

235
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,450
The police are coming soon.

236
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,920
Yes,you're right.

237
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,040
Dragging this...

238
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,680
...will not help us.

239
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,280
Uncle De! -Xiaorui,don't worry about me.

240
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,360
Qin Haoran! -I have time to play with you.

241
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:39,920
Fine.

242
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,840
The item is with me. Let him go.

243
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,920
Feng Quan. The Golden Eyes.

244
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,640
The hostage is safe. Move in.

245
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,720
Freeze! -Don't move!

246
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,640
Freeze! -Don't move!

247
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,160
Calm down.

248
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,880
If you don't want him dead, stay back.

249
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,880
Have you seen a criminal negotiating with the police?

250
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,320
Qin Haoran, you killed Gu Tianfeng.

251
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,780
Now,you will not even let Uncle De go.

252
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,640
Gu Tianfeng? Do you really think I kill Gu Tianfeng?

253
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,120
Qin Haoran,if you want to hurt Zhuang Rui,...

254
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,200
...you have to kill me first.

255
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,840
Do you think I don't dare to do it?

256
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,770
The worst consequence is we die together!

257
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,960
The criminal wants to kill the hostage. He is now shot to death.

258
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,280
Uncle De. -Uncle De,are you okay?

259
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,280
I'm fine. -I'm okay.

260
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,920
Uncle De. -I'm fine.

261
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:41,720
Over here.

262
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,200
Xuanbing,...

263
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,920
...I cannot accompany you anymore.

264
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,200
Father!

265
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,120
Father!

266
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,440
We're done. I'm going first.

267
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,370
Zhuang Rui accompanies Uncle De to the hospital.

268
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,640
How is Uncle De?

269
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,370
Don't worry. He's fine.

270
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,520
Then,do we want to buy some gelatin as...

271
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,040
...supplements? -Don't worry too much.

272
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,240
Uncle De doesn't need them. I think I need them.

273
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,000
Then,I'll buy some...

274
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,960
...monkey and horse brains...

275
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,360
...and goat and pig brains...

276
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,480
...for your brain. -Sure.

277
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,800
In order to be with Miss Xiaojia,...

278
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,060
...I think I should take care of my brain.

279
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,820
Sit down,Xiaorui.

280
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,160
Boss Qin...

281
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,760
...is someone experienced.

282
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,480
Why would he be so stubborn?

283
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,480
Isn't it just an archaeological notebook?

284
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,760
Why is it so attractive to him?

285
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,160
Actually, it is left by my grandfather.

286
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,100
Your grandfather?

287
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,760
The notebook recorded a lot of...

288
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,540
...strange experiences faced by the expedition team.

289
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,640
I don't think Qin Haoran just want the notebook.

290
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,520
That means that the notebook...

291
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,580
...is related to Qin family's wealth...

292
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,080
...or it will affect Qin Haoran's life,...

293
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,880
...am I right? -Yes.

294
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,400
If not,he will not exchange his life for...

295
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,920
...this notebook.

296
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,320
The notebook recorded the situations faced by...

297
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,980
...the archaeological team.

298
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,800
I'm also using it to find...

299
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,480
...the person who killed Grandfather Gu and my grandfather.

300
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,410
I deducted that this is related to Qin Haoran.

301
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,970
Luckily, he didn't have the notebook.

302
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,450
You have also returned safely.

303
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,200
With the death of Qin Haoran,...

304
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,220
...Qin Jewellery will not be able to continue for long.

305
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:28,320
Although we removed another industry criminal,...

306
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,840
...the relationship of the community is more complicated.

307
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,080
So,this will certainly be a huge shock.

308
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,840
It's a danger...

309
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,130
...but is also a turning point.

310
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,120
Now,it depends on all of you.

311
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,040
Do you have any plan?

312
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,280
I may have to disappoint you.

313
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,400
I don't have any plans for now.

314
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,380
I just thought that...

315
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,160
...once everything is settled,...

316
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,230
...I'll come and ask you to teach me.

317
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:16,120
You are always humble.

318
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,409
I still remember when we first met,...

319
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,080
...you were still a student...

320
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,480
...who didn't know much.

321
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,190
In the blink of an eye, you have become...

322
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,760
...a little out of reach even for this old man.

323
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,760
I was right.

324
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,150
Didn't I say that you will become successful?

325
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,880
Good. Continue to work hard for now.

326
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,400
As long as you continue,you will be very successful in the future.

327
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,140
Thank you for the praise, Uncle De. I'll remember that.

328
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,460
I'll continue to work hard and keep moving forward.

329
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,360
You have really matured.

330
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,600
I'll always be proud of you.

331
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,600
Xiaorui,...

332
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,220
...no matter what happens in the future,...

333
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,040
...I really hope that both of us can...

334
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,420
...chat nicely like this.

335
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,640
Uncle De, I will always visit you.

336
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,800
It will be difficult.

337
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,220
Zhuang Rui,...

338
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,200
...is Uncle De all right?

339
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,680
His injuries are not serious. He can leave the hospital soon.

340
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,640
I admire the police even more now.

341
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,200
You're able to shoot the criminal and save the citizen.

342
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,520
That was to save the hostage.

343
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,770
However,I think this incident is quite strange.

344
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,560
Qin Haoran is meticulous. His plans are always calculated.

345
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,120
According to his style,...

346
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,210
...why would he not care about the results and be impulsive?

347
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,680
Besides,he has no grudge against Uncle De.

348
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,920
For him, Uncle De is just a pawn.

349
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,080
He didn't need to act against the police for him.

350
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,560
Unless something upset him back then...

351
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:53,640
...or the incident escalated until he couldn't handle it.

352
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,680
Still,we cannot ask him now as he is dead.

353
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,960
He killed Grandfather Gu. He may have died in vain.

354
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,720
When I was negotiating with Qin Haoran,I asked him that...

355
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,840
...and he denied.

356
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,440
Are you stupid? Which criminal will admit his crime?

357
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,840
I also suspected this but he had a watertight alibi.

358
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,720
Besides,Xuanbing was at Qin's house at that time...

359
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,960
...and didn't know about this.

360
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,960
If Qin Haoran didn't do it, who will hurt Grandfather Gu?

361
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,160
I think that Grandfather Gu's death...

362
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,300
...is related to the Golden Eyes.

363
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,300
If we remove the possibility that Qin Haoran did it,...

364
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,040
...it may be that mysterious Old Ma.

365
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,080
Now,Qin Haoran is dead and the links are gone.

366
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,010
It's more difficult to find Old Ma.

367
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:04,000
The person happiest about Qin Haoran's death...

368
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,640
...would be Old Ma.

369
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,960
He may be living happily somewhere.

370
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,120
Rui,we cannot let this be. We must find him.

371
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,420
Feifei,...

372
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,650
...you should visit Qin Xuanbing.

373
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,890
After all, he was her adoptive father.

374
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,340
With the things the have been happening,...

375
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,120
...she really needs a friend by her side to support her.

376
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,000
What's more, she has decided to surrender.

377
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,040
If don't see her now,it will be difficult in the future.

378
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,570
I don't know how to face her.

379
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,680
She has already paid for what she did.

380
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,640
Besides, she saved you many times.

381
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,400
You should visit her.

382
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,000
Zhuang Rui is returning to Beijing tomorrow.

383
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,660
He entered Feng Quan Tomb. Don't let him continue investigating.

384
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,320
I think we can take this risk.

385
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,690
Find an opportunity to kill him tomorrow.

386
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,800
The Officer Miao by his side...

387
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,320
...may be waiting for you to surrender.

388
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,480
Even if he knows, it's all right.

389
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,280
Maybe he can lead us to find the other jade.

390
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,060
Then,what should we do next? -We?

391
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:27,120
You just have to worry about yourself.

392
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,320
They will never find me.
