1
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,800
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Episode 49

3
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,640
Are you all right? -I'm all right.

4
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,720
Here,try to stand up.

5
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,260
Come on.

6
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,200
This is information on Xiaoma that I got from Gansu.

7
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,560
I presented this to Chief Ding. He allowed you two to check it.

8
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,960
Xiaoma's real name is Ma Tengfeng.

9
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:34,540
At 6 years old,he followed his widowed mother,Liu Yanping...

10
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,200
...to Li's family village when she remarried.

11
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,120
However,he quarrels with his stepfather often and is a loner.

12
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,920
Although he's poor, he loves reading books...

13
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,260
...or newspapers.

14
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,360
He also likes exploring the desert alone.

15
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,800
So he's well-versed with the desert topography and weather.

16
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,400
He started rearing camels at 8 years old.

17
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,640
He might have met the expedition team...

18
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,200
...when they're looking to rent camels.

19
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,720
Furthermore, he's also their local guide.

20
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,269
He should be 15 years old then.

21
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,270
Did he leave Li family's village? -Yes.

22
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,520
2 month's after the incident,...

23
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,880
...he made an appeal to the village committee.

24
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:36,159
He read that a jade factory in Lanzhou was hiring young men,...

25
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,740
...so he left the village to work.

26
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,600
This information is enough...

27
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,440
...for police to suggest that he is the prime suspect...

28
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,700
...for the expedition case 40 years ago.

29
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,040
Is this all? Where is he now?

30
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,480
Census then wasn't standardized.

31
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,659
No one had identification cards.

32
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,540
Perhaps Li family's village only had a few hundred people.

33
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,560
Looking for him would be difficult.

34
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,240
Looking for Ma Tengfeng needs time.

35
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,240
Luckily,Gansu's police are cooperative.

36
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,320
We're currently applying to obtain...

37
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,160
...the list of factory workers at Lanzhou 40 years ago.

38
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,800
With this list, we'll start from each area.

39
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,730
How long will this take?

40
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,360
I can't be certain.

41
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,120
If he changed his name or migrated elsewhere,...

42
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,600
...it'll be akin to finding a needle in a haystack.

43
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,000
As of now,we can only hope that Ma Tengfeng...

44
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,930
...isn't as clever.

45
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,480
I'll ask Miss Qin to come back. -No need.

46
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,600
I can free a butterfly from its cocoon...

47
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,440
...but I can't control where it chooses to fly.

48
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,480
It's her freedom,isn't it?

49
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,280
Some don't like carrying heavy burden in life.

50
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,440
The weight is too much. She's different.

51
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,720
The heavy burden...

52
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,680
...is what gives her courage to keep living.

53
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,200
Wang Qigang.

54
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,440
How do you know my name?

55
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,480
Don't worry. I'm not a cop.

56
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm not a debt collector either.

57
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,960
I have some questions for you.

58
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,000
Answer them honestly and you'll be fine.

59
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,000
What do you want to know?

60
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,400
In the year 2000,...

61
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,040
...Qin Haoran hired you as personal bodyguard...

62
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,160
...on a Beijing trip with Zheng Chuan of Ai Xi's Jewellery.

63
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,360
Do you remember that?

64
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,890
All I know is that...

65
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,560
...Qin Haoran and Zheng Chuan went to Beijing...

66
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,960
...to meet a potential investor,but...

67
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,840
...there was a dispute with the potential investor.

68
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,120
Zheng Chuan suspects that the investor's money was illegal.

69
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,480
After that,we were told to get rid of Zheng Chuan.

70
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,160
I was responsible to stay with Zheng Chuan's daughter...

71
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,020
...so she wouldn't ruin the plan.

72
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,560
I didn't do the dirty job.

73
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,480
Or else,I wouldn't be alive now.

74
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,680
That can't be.

75
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,480
I heard that...

76
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,880
...Qin Haoran's leg was shot while protecting Zheng Chuan.

77
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,040
I heard this from the other two bodyguards.

78
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,880
The bullet to Qin Haoran's leg...

79
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,650
...was shot by Zheng Chuan before he died.

80
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,920
Zheng Chuan's daughter was so young then.

81
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,540
She easily believed Qin Haoran's story.

82
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,800
I heard that Zheng Chuan's daughter...

83
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,960
...is living as the Qin family's daughter.

84
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,320
What a pity.

85
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,160
All I know is that Qin Haoran and Zheng Chuan...

86
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,210
...went to Beijing to meet a potential investor.

87
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,800
However,when they arrived,...

88
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,640
...there was a dispute with the potential investor.

89
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,240
Zheng Chuan suspects the investor's money was illegal.

90
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,400
After that,we were told to get rid of Zheng Chuan.

91
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,680
I was responsible to stay with Zheng Chuan's daughter...

92
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,540
...so she wouldn't ruin the plan.

93
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,320
I didn't do the dirty job.

94
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,040
Or else, I wouldn't be alive now.

95
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,340
I don't believe it.

96
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,890
Why isn't there anything about my father?

97
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,040
Maybe they lied to me.

98
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,240
Nakagawa and the bodyguard were lying.

99
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,760
Qin Haoran and you were friends.

100
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,920
He wouldn't kill you.

101
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,440
Father.

102
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,840
Look at the camera!

103
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,320
3! 2! -Wait.

104
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,000
All right. -Okay.

105
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,040
I'm taking the picture. -Smile.

106
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,400
Did it come out good? -Yes,it's great.

107
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,240
Father! -Thank you.

108
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,920
When will I get my present? -I'll give it to you...

109
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,250
...after your birthday,okay? -Okay.

110
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,040
You lied to me.

111
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,770
You didn't even give my 8th birthday present.

112
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,200
Xiaobing,my child.

113
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,640
When you read this, I'm no longer with the living.

114
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,440
I founded Ai Xi Jewellery for you.

115
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,320
I won't allow anyone to use it to do anything bad.

116
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,480
Stay away from Qin Haoran and Old Ma,the investor.

117
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,440
Leave Kiev and Beijing.

118
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,600
I love you.

119
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,760
Sister,we've Ma Tengfeng's lead. -So soon?

120
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,920
Chief Ding outsourced to the Civil Investigation Unit,...

121
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,840
...Lanzhou's Industry and Commerce Bureau and district offices.

122
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,800
They pulled all-nighters and found information with photos.

123
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,480
Yes.

124
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,560
This person is me. What's with it?

125
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,800
This person is Ma Tengfeng.

126
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,880
He's the factory head of Bi Hua Jade factory.

127
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,330
Have you contacted him lately?

128
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,890
I have no recollection of Ma Tengfeng.

129
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,440
No recollection?

130
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,240
You were there on its opening ceremony.

131
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,320
You must have been a partner.

132
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,880
That was 25 years ago.

133
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,960
Xi Huang Jewellery wasn't founded yet.

134
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,480
I always return to China in search of partners.

135
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,000
Be it factory head, supplier or distributor.

136
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,160
I've met at least 100 of them but I only worked with 5 or 6.

137
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,600
If not for this picture, I wouldn't remember.....

138
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,840
What's the factory name? -Bi Hua Jade Factory.

139
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,920
Yes. I wouldn't remember that I've worked with them.

140
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,080
Mr. Qin.

141
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,680
As a police officer, it's my duty to remind you.

142
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,920
Ma Tengfeng is a suspect in several criminal investigation.

143
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,480
If you fail to report knowledge of a felony,...

144
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,210
...you're harbouring a criminal.

145
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,240
I'm aware of this. It's not my first time with the police.

146
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,920
Anything Officer Miao asks of me,...

147
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,500
...I'll be glad to give my full cooperation.

148
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,690
However, please do not cross the line.

149
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,760
Don't force me about things I have no recollection of.

150
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,840
I don't know if anything he said was true.

151
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,180
I don't believe a word.

152
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,120
Hello,senior. What a surprise.

153
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,640
I'm the officer outsourced by Chief Ding for your case.

154
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,200
Really? -Of course.

155
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,440
Listen,we have information on Ma Tengfeng from Gansu.

156
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,120
Let's talk somewhere. -I just finished. I'll meet you.

157
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,280
Okay,I'll see you.

158
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,690
The female cop was just at my place.

159
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,960
The police work faster than we had expected.

160
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,210
It's time to think about our next plan for Zhuang Rui.

161
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,960
Jiang Tai Lu,tomorrow night.

162
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,600
It's you.

163
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,800
How long have you been following me?

164
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,880
Mr. Nakagawa knew you'd find Qin Haoran for revenge.

165
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,320
He knows he can't stop you so I'm sent to protect you.

166
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,280
It's my family's issue. I don't want anyone involved.

167
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,560
Mr. Nakagawa said the police are watching Qin Haoran.

168
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,290
He's responsible for more than one death.

169
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,460
The police will eventually capture him.

170
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,500
The Qin family is influential. You know better.

171
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,520
If you go alone,you'll be digging your own grave.

172
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,850
I can't wait any longer.

173
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,720
I intercepted Qin Haoran's phone call.

174
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,400
It's not just about my revenge,...

175
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,560
...Zhuang Rui is in danger.

176
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,440
Qin Haoran will meet his boss tonight.

177
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,880
What?

178
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,920
I'll handle this on my own. Thank Mr. Nakagawa on my behalf.

179
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,240
Jiajia,you've been dating for a while.

180
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,580
Your boyfriend never treats us to a meal.

181
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,920
Is he that busy? -I can't help it,too.

182
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,320
He's busy earning money. I don't even see him often.

183
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,120
He always gives me jewellery to make up for things.

184
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,800
Jewellery? I want jewellery to make up for things,too.

185
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,360
What is it? -What should I do?

186
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,440
I forgot that my boyfriend broke his leg.

187
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,200
I need to visit him. We'll do this another day.

188
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,920
I'll leave first. -Jiajia!

189
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,320
It's impossible.

190
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,040
Xiaoyun.

191
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,040
Xiaojia? -I never knew...

192
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,200
...that you're so generous.

193
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,200
No,I.....

194
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,080
I was shopping and passed by. Why are you here?

195
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,560
Are you here to take me to dinner?

196
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,460
What were you talking about happily?

197
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,640
We were talking about.....

198
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:43,440
I didn't ask you. Please go ahead.

199
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,520
We're talking about treatment plans.

200
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,840
Treatment plans?

201
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,480
What's that? -It's for Zhuang Rui.

202
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,800
I'm a ophthalmologist from the station.

203
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:06,960
I'm meeting Mr. Huang Fuyun to discuss Zhuang Rui's condition.

204
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,320
Also,your boyfriend can never be a doctor.

205
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,450
Many lives will be lost because of him.

206
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,480
Mr. Zhuang has a brain damage the causes optic neuropathy.

207
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,120
Experts are discussing his treatment plans.

208
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,340
I'll take my leave now.

209
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:28,040
Doctor,I'll see you off. -See her off?

210
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,360
Haven't you talked enough? You like to see beautiful ladies?

211
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,440
I'll take you to the street to feast your eyes.

212
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,080
Let's look at beautiful ladies.

213
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,890
People are watching us.

214
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,410
What? You found a beautiful lady already?

215
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,480
Feifei? -Who is that?

216
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,200
A senior from the police academy. -Senior?

217
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,840
She found a new flame so soon.

218
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,880
He's an old flame, not a new one.

219
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,890
They were almost together at the police academy.

220
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,560
You go back first. I need to tell Zhuang Rui.

221
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,280
I'll put out this flame of desire.

222
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,760
Go home first. -Okay.

223
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,280
Bye.

224
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,400
Hello,Zhuang Rui.

225
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,360
Let me tell you.....

226
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,440
40 years ago,Ma Tengfeng left Li family's village.

227
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,640
He worked at a jade factory in Lanzhou.

228
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,440
He was voted as model worker 3 times.

229
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,440
Later,he was promoted to a key personnel.

230
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,840
After that,he resigned and started his own business.

231
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,880
He founded Bi Hua Jade Factory.

232
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,160
3 years later, he sold his factory.

233
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,960
These are all the information on Ma Tengfeng when he was alive.

234
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:12,960
Wait,when he was alive?

235
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,820
After the factory was sold off, Ma Tengfeng was in an accident.

236
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,640
Senior,are you certain of this?

237
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,640
Look at this.

238
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,280
I found his death certificate using his registered address.

239
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,440
This shouldn't be a mistake.

240
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,040
Feifei,this is an old case.

241
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,160
Things like this can happen.

242
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,730
Don't be despaired.

243
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,320
Why are you here? -We're just passing by.

244
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,280
You look like you're discussing about a case.

245
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,040
We're curious and came over.

246
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,680
Is it a trend to pat someone's head during investigation?

247
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,640
Senior,this is Zhuang Rui.

248
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,570
He's involved in this case.

249
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,280
This is Zhou Linyang,my senior. He's an officer,too.

250
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,040
Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you.

251
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,560
I'm Huang Fuyun. Nice to meet you.

252
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,400
Zhuang Rui,I've read about you in the case file.

253
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,040
Chief Ding talked about you. -Feifei never mentioned me?

254
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,760
We...

255
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,380
...are close friends.

256
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,760
Feifei is passionate and has many friends.

257
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,840
Chief Ding told me...

258
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,680
...that you're in the antique business.

259
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,960
I know antiques dealers. The most famous one...

260
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,480
...is Old Mr. Chen Hequan. Our family are friends.

261
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,360
If you want, I can introduce you to him.

262
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,200
Chen Hequan?

263
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,520
Old Chen!

264
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,000
He called last week saying business was bad.

265
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,160
Ruiyunzhai lent him some items to display at his store.

266
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,560
We're working with many people lately.

267
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,280
I can't remember all of them.

268
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,400
I see.

269
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,960
I didn't know their business is big.

270
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,160
I was rude. -Senior.

271
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,000
Don't listen to them. They're rich and snobby.

272
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,000
It's all right.

273
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,980
Okay. Continue reminiscing. I'll go first.

274
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,740
Feifei, let's have dinner together!

275
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,080
My friend,can't you see?

276
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,480
Feifei's heart is not here. No need to have meals together.

277
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,040
Zhuang Rui!

278
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,080
Are you angry? -Why would I be angry?

279
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,770
Are you jealous?

280
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,300
What are you saying? Why should I be jealous?

281
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,480
You are.

282
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,520
You're not. -I'm not.

283
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,460
I'm not jealous. Weren't you reminiscing with him?

284
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:50,960
Continue reminiscing. -We weren't reminiscing.

285
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,920
Weren't we discussing a case? He's outsourced by Chief Ding.

286
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,520
Must he pat your head?

287
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,400
Well,he.....

288
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,200
He was comforting me.

289
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,760
We have information from Gansu.

290
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:14,360
Ma Tengfeng perished in an accident 20 years ago.

291
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:15,960
What?

292
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,250
Ma Tengfeng is dead?

293
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:28,760
Hello.

294
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,410
I'll be right there.

295
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,440
If you call the shots,...

296
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,370
...using Zhuang Rui to obtain the stone won't be difficult.

297
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,300
If we have the Tamamoku stone,...

298
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,720
...Zhuang Rui is not important anymore.

299
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,840
Xiaoqin.

300
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,120
We need to be calm at a time like this.

301
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,960
Don't let your recklessness ruin the plan.

302
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,400
We'll stop here today.

303
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,320
All right.

304
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,010
I'll see you off.

305
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,120
All right,I'll go now. -Okay.

306
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,000
Don't worry,Old Ma. Take care.

307
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,000
Let go of me!

308
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:41,360
Miss,you're not dead. -Let go of me!

309
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,920
When they found A'Gui,...

310
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,720
...I thought,...

311
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:09,520
...if only you were still alive.

312
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,560
I can't believe that you escaped death...

313
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,640
...but you're making bigger mistakes.

314
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,940
Before you met Zhuang Rui,...

315
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,120
...you were obedient and smart.

316
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,240
You were the best daughter in the world.

317
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,800
You mean the best tool in the world?

318
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,320
I'm the first person in the world...

319
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,660
...to teach you how to use a knife.

320
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,360
I didn't expect...

321
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,680
...that you would use it to stab me.

322
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,680
If I knew that you killed my father...

323
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,520
...and lied to me all this while,...

324
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,040
...I would've killed you first.

325
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,840
I thought Zhuang Rui brainwashed you.

326
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,680
I had no idea...

327
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,360
...you did this for Zheng Chuan.

328
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,160
I respected you like my own father.

329
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,360
Yet you killed him,used me and lied to me. Why?

330
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,880
Lied to you?

331
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,600
It's because I wanted you to be my real daughter!

332
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,130
All these years,...

333
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,680
...I've taught and nurtured you,...

334
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,180
...they've all gone to waste.

335
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,640
A'Gui,take her away. -Yes. Take her away!

336
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,720
Sir,do you think miss...

337
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,320
...planned this with Zhuang Rui and Nakagawa?

338
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,960
What will they do next?

339
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,320
We'll have to ask them.

340
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,920
Mr. Qin,you're sneaky.

341
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,920
5 cars left your house in different directions.

342
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,760
It wasn't easy finding you.

343
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,300
Mr. Nakagawa, you care so much for me.

344
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,760
Since you found me,tell me. What do you want?

345
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,300
You've had your meal and your guest has left.

346
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,970
Let's get to the matter at hand.

347
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,260
Where's Qin Xuanbing?

348
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,720
Xuanbing?

349
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:25,400
You ask me? I thought you and her eloped.

350
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,440
Why? You can't find her,too?

351
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,080
Please tell us where Qin Xuanbing is.

352
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,600
Stop!

353
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,020
Don't stop him.

354
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,720
Let Mr. Nakagawa check wherever he wants.

355
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,970
You're not police officers. You can't search me.

356
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,040
You're lucky I stopped my car for you.

357
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,200
I should go.

358
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,000
I was hoping Xuanbing was in his car.

359
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,080
At least...

360
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,320
...this means that he values their relationship...

361
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,840
...and won't harm her.

362
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,520
I'm Nakagawa.

363
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,440
Okay,understood.

364
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,680
Kojima has news. Let's go.
