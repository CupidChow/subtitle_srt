00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,500
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,500
Episode 15

3
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,539
Let me tell you.

4
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,500
Don't be discouraged.

5
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,840
As the saying goes, good comes out of misfortune.

6
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,160
With no misfortune,how can there be good,am I right?

7
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,120
Don't let that petty incident...

8
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,560
...stop us from earning money.

9
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,240
That was not an accident.

10
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,600
I was driving that day. When the car was going downhill,...

11
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,960
...the brake has obviously failed which made the wheels to spin.

12
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,160
Xu Wei is ruthless,he would do anything to reach his goal.

13
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,539
You are aware of what he made me do to Rui in Ping Zhou.

14
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,490
I suspect that.....

15
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,840
Ridiculous!

16
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,880
I thought that he was an average villain.

17
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,720
This is a murder attempt.

18
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,360
What about the car? Have you inspected it yet?

19
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,920
What did the police say? -It's been inspected.

20
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,980
The call earlier was from the police.

21
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:33,400
Stop beating around the bush. Hurry up and tell us.

22
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,060
The police has inspected the car.

23
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,760
The brake tube was indeed tampered with,...

24
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,040
...and the bolts had been loosened.

25
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,760
I can't believe this. He's attempting murder!

26
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,100
Tell the police to arrest him!

27
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,840
Has Feifei caught Xu Wei yet? I must ask her.

28
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,570
It's not him.

29
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,160
The police located the car service centre.

30
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,720
They found the mechanic who serviced the car,...

31
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,920
...and he admitted to have been under the influence of alcohol.

32
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,980
It was a mistake. No one made him do it.

33
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,400
No one made him do it?

34
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,760
Is there even justice?

35
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,000
There is.

36
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,250
There has to be justice.

37
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,360
Feifei.

38
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,840
What? I only brought two. You weren't in the accident.

39
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,900
It's not that. I don't want the apple.

40
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,690
Let's talk about the accident.

41
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,240
Someone messed with the shipment truck.

42
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,120
We suspect...

43
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,940
...that Xu Wei is behind this.

44
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,840
Is there evidence? -I.....

45
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,500
Do we still need evidence?

46
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,000
What mechanic tampers with brake tubes and loosen bolts when drunk?

47
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,400
Who would believe that no one made him do it?

48
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,460
Xu Wei hated Xiao Rui at the Ping Zhou auction...

49
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,540
...and did many dirty tricks.

50
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,220
Who will you arrest if not him?

51
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,440
How do I arrest him without any evidence?

52
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,570
Even if I do arrest him,he'll be released after 24 hours.

53
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,120
Is there no other way?

54
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,440
Actually,I've asked my colleagues about your accident case.

55
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,720
During interrogation, the mechanic...

56
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,440
...has a watertight explanation.

57
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,300
He's obviously just a scapegoat.

58
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,880
However.....

59
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,250
Hello,Zhao.

60
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,400
We found the smith who makes the triangular arrow.

61
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,160
Where are you? I'll be right there.

62
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,920
I'll leave now. -But,that.....

63
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,640
This..... -What do we do now?

64
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,530
I've overestimated Xu Wei's bottom line.

65
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,170
Just because of a failed stone gamble,...

66
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,800
...he wants to kill us.

67
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,170
We can't let this go easily.

68
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,490
You're right! We can't let this go easily.

69
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,340
I'll tamper with his brake tube,how about that?

70
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,820
This is driving me up the wall.

71
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,159
We're the police.

72
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,160
Did you know?

73
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,680
The person who asked you to make the arrows...

74
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,680
...is now a suspect in a murder case.

75
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,240
Please come with me to the station for investigation.

76
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,520
What good would that do?

77
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,720
Did you know why he didn't kill me before running away?

78
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,880
Did you know why he spared my life?

79
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,240
I'm half-blind.

80
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,600
What could you get out of me?

81
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,660
What an exquisite bow.

82
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,480
Its shaped like a Sandali panther.

83
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,680
However,the bow piece is more elaborated.

84
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,440
The extra pulleys...

85
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,360
...are meant for long-range accuracy,am I right?

86
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,920
You're right. This bow...

87
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,600
...is silent,smokeless and without flame.

88
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,760
However,it's as lethal as any other weapons,...

89
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,500
...including the gun in your pocket.

90
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,440
For generations,my family...

91
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,320
...has been bow craftsman.

92
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,680
It's a pity that it'll end in my hands.

93
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,800
These days,few people know about...

94
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,240
...the bow as a weapon.

95
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:08,400
A good bow needs a good arrow like this one.

96
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,040
Only a good arrow is worthy to be used with the bow you make,...

97
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,080
...to form a lethal weapon.

98
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,880
Although this it takes longer to load than a normal crossbow,...

99
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,080
...but,it shoots at a further range.

100
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,280
And,it's lethal.

101
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,880
It's a lethal weapon to kill from afar during ancient times.

102
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,900
These days,...

103
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,360
...not many young people know about this type of bow.

104
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,000
You and him are those who know.

105
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,560
We're considered soulmates.

106
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,440
Now,it has taken someone's life.

107
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,640
There is now blood on your hands.

108
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:57,240
In this industry,it's only a matter of time...

109
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,820
...to have blood on your hands. This will have to see blood.

110
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,120
It has been,is and will always be this way.

111
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,120
I wanted to stop making it.

112
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,930
However,...

113
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,960
...I've been making this my whole life.

114
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,890
I can't let it go.

115
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,040
I'm not willing to have it...

116
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,180
...destroyed in my hands,...

117
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,840
...and gone forever.

118
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,570
About the person that you're looking for.

119
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,240
He's taller than me, roughly around 180 cm.

120
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,800
He's neither thin nor fat,...

121
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,320
...and light on his feet.

122
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,960
It seems like he's been trained.

123
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,800
He also has a Southern accent.

124
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,490
I remember him having slim fingers...

125
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,640
...but his handshake was powerful.

126
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,760
To be honest,I felt...

127
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,720
...a killer's aura on him.

128
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,000
At first,I didn't agree to make it for him.

129
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,720
However,he kept coming back and we talked about bows.

130
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,920
He said that he loved bows.

131
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,640
Well,I love bows,too.

132
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,540
We ended up talking a lot about it.

133
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,720
Who would have known?

134
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,360
He said that he was a collector.

135
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,210
What else do you know about him?

136
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,280
He has a feminine smell on him.

137
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,560
It was light,I think it was...

138
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,020
...the smell of amber.

139
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,280
It was the smell of amber.

140
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,720
Amber?

141
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,200
Please come with me.

142
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,490
Alright.

143
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,560
I knew this day would come.

144
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,610
Let's go.

145
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,680
Mr. Xu,my car dealership...

146
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,770
...has the police coming in every three days.

147
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,700
I can't take it any longer.

148
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,840
Haven't I paid you handsomely these past two years?

149
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,170
Don't tell me you can't even handle the family of a mechanic.

150
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,820
RMB 1 million for a brake tube, that's more than enough.

151
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,080
Yes. -Stop putting on an act.

152
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,920
You can have the RMB 1 million for now,...

153
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,450
...I'll give you another job within two days.

154
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,000
Mr. Li,send Boss Xu back.

155
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,560
I used to be able to down the whole bottle of white wine.

156
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,540
Now,just a glass of red wine is enough to give me a headache.

157
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,200
We're getting older. Director Qin.

158
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,920
The future of Xu and Qin family...

159
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,210
...lies in the hands of young people like him.

160
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,480
I flew all the way from Kiev to take care of Xuanbing.

161
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,720
I'd also like to meet Xiao Xu.

162
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,160
Xu Wei.

163
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,560
Xuanbing has mentioned you.

164
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,480
Did she say anything bad about me?

165
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,280
I understand Bingbing...

166
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,770
...and I'm clear about what I want.

167
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,800
I genuinely care for her.

168
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,240
Her accident this time...

169
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,400
...has made me extremely worried.

170
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,050
I hired a bodyguard and chauffeur to watch over her for 24 hours.

171
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,000
Uncle Qin,you have my word...

172
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,620
...that I'll not let anything like this happen to Bingbing again.

173
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,960
Alright,sit down.

174
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,250
You're thoughtful.

175
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,160
Ladies are easily swayed.

176
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,200
When there are many suitor, one is spoilt for choice.

177
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,480
That's normal.

178
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,880
Old Mr. Xu.

179
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,760
Your nephew is talented...

180
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,580
...and attentive.

181
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,250
He will accomplish a lot in the future.

182
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,970
You're flattering him.

183
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,480
We'll leave their affairs to themselves.

184
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,360
As long as they're happy.

185
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,100
I invited you here to talk about something else.

186
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,370
I have a batch of ancient jades from the Ming dynasty.

187
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,480
Would you be interested in them?

188
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,570
What do you mean?

189
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,840
They are all jade ornaments.

190
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,920
These stock has been around auctions for quite some time.

191
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,720
There's the risk and not being able to sell them in the country.

192
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,320
My uncle and I are well aware of your influence overseas.

193
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,380
You have an excellent connection for transportation.

194
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,320
If you're willing to work with us, we'll divide the profit 40:60.

195
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,760
We're family friends, the profit is a small matter.

196
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,720
However,I'm worried about the transportation risk.

197
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,920
Don't have to worry about that, we have a trusted car dealership.

198
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,680
With the upcoming Ping Zhou auction,...

199
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,330
...suppliers will be exporting their goods.

200
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,300
We'll use the exporting of gemstones as a cover.

201
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,720
It'll be safe. Once the goods arrive overseas,...

202
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,660
...our profits will at least be tripled.

203
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,800
Your family have a knack for doing business.

204
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,400
No wonder you could maintain being the leading gem stone dealer.

205
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,300
Seeing that you're an old friend,...

206
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,580
...I will help you out.

207
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,040
However,the reason that I came back...

208
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,320
...is to take care of Xuanbing and to meet up with friends.

209
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,240
I have many matters to attend to,so...

210
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,160
...regarding the transportation of goods by sea,...

211
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,640
...I'll leave it to Xiao Xu. Xu Wei,...

212
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,400
...do as you see fit. -I will,uncle.

213
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,400
Thank you,Director Qin, for trusting me.

214
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,040
Being the leading stone dealer is merely temporary.

215
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,680
When your business becomes steady in the mainland,...

216
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,920
..it'll be hard for me to catch up with you.

217
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,240
Xiao Wei,give a toast to your Uncle Qin.

218
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,000
You'll be needing his guidance.

219
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,530
Uncle Qin,a toast to you. -I'll drink to that.

220
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,099
We are using our connections to ship and export.

221
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,360
If the customs suspect anything, we are to bear the consequences.

222
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,020
They contribute nothing,...

223
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,680
...and yet they're able to ship and export through us.

224
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,200
They have the nerve to split the profits 40:60.

225
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,560
This uncle and nephew duo has really calculated their moves.

226
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,920
Father,...

227
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,840
...it's not cost-effective for us to be smuggling goods.

228
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,480
We have a bigger fish to fry.

229
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,640
Xu family wants our money and resources.

230
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,140
Those things are not of utmost importance to us.

231
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,840
Look at how...

232
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,600
...Xiao Xu cares so much about you.

233
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,680
He hired bodyguards and wouldn't leave your side.

234
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,600
If you look at it this way,...

235
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,480
...this may be a worthwhile deal.

236
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,800
Does this mean that the accident...

237
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,000
...was planned by Xu Wei?

238
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,720
Whether or not it's him,it's my fault for making you this way.

239
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,840
I will find out the assailant and make him pay for this.

240
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,520
However,in order to capture Xu Wei,...

241
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,810
...we need concrete evidence.

242
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,480
Do you have any clues? -I don't have any,unfortunately.

243
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,280
However,...

244
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,380
...last night,...

245
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,660
...Xu Wei and his uncle met with my father to have a discussion.

246
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,680
They met with Uncle Qin? Why is that?

247
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,530
They wanted my father to ship some antique jade overseas...

248
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,800
...disguised as gemstones for their own profit.

249
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,690
Isn't this smuggling of goods?

250
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,320
Yes,and it's not the first time we have been coerced.

251
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,080
The Xu family is a major player in the mainland's jade industry.

252
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,760
Besides,Xi Huang Jewellery is breaking into the mainland market.

253
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,680
Xu family has the resources,...

254
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,250
...so,they're using that to threaten us.

255
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,770
If my father refuses to work with them,...

256
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,970
...Xi Huang Jewellery would suffer unimaginable loss.

257
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,120
If the car accident was indeed planned by them,...

258
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,010
...you might not be their sole target.

259
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,680
Did they plan this to make Qin family work with them...

260
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,840
...by setting this trap to hurt you?

261
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,080
Why didn't you make a police report?

262
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,250
Xu Wei hired bodyguards to keep an eye on me and my father.

263
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,060
How can we make a police report without concrete evidence?

264
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,640
Besides,unless they were caught red-handed,...

265
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,880
...the police can't convict the Xu family.

266
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,040
They might seek revenge after that.

267
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,520
I don't know what I can do now.

268
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,680
To smuggle goods,they would need to ship the goods,right?

269
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,640
Yes,Xu Wei said...

270
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,160
...that they will be using their trusted car dealership.

271
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,490
Car dealership? What is it called?

272
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,480
This should be the place.

273
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,850
You're not going to make me tamper with their brake tube?

274
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,500
That,I can do. It's not a problem.

275
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,380
I'll go now.

276
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,300
Go and find some work to do.

277
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,970
Can you please move faster?

278
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,480
Boss,do you have any trucks for rental?

279
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,960
We do but we're currently rushing some orders.

280
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,820
Try other car dealerships. -Please don't say that.

281
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,320
You said you have trucks and we've tried other dealerships.

282
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,880
Please help us out.

283
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,840
This is a huge order of almost 500 boxes of goods.

284
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,520
This is really urgent.

285
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,410
I'm willing to pay a higher price if you agree.

286
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,840
What could be so urgent?

287
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,160
They're mainly fruits such as mangosteens.

288
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,960
If we don't ship them now,it will perish and go to waste.

289
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,760
That's right.

290
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,140
How about this?

291
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,520
Here's RMB 3000. Please help us out.

292
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,810
We don't that many trucks. I'm afraid we can't handle 500 boxes.

293
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,810
It's alright,we'll ship as many as we can.

294
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,960
I mean,we deal with fruits,it's better to suffer fewer losses.

295
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,120
Forget it,I'm not taking on this job.

296
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,610
I can't make the decision without my boss.

297
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,000
There are car dealerships around and it's not peak shipping season.

298
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,520
I suggest you to take your business elsewhere.

299
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,920
My friend,don't you want the money?

300
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,370
Let's go elsewhere.

301
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,020
I won't see you out.

302
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,210
Did you get to see it?

303
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,040
I saw it. -I didn't. Are you sure?

304
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,440
No. You can go back and take a look again if you want.

305
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:45,840
I.....

306
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,730
Don't be like that. I'm sure you saw it.

307
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,320
Feifei.

308
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,920
We're not just talking about the car accident.

309
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,730
Xu family is forcing Qin family to smuggle goods.

310
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,000
I was at the car dealership and got the shipping information.

311
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,850
You'll be able to capture Xu Wei with this.

312
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,330
Alright,I understand. We'll talk again.

313
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,560
Sister,if what Zhuang Rui said is true,...

314
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,600
...the money involved in this case is huge.

315
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,360
We couldn't capture Xu Wei due to lack of evidence...

316
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,290
...but now we have a lead. Why are you still frowning?

317
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,920
This case is not that simple.

318
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,760
The contract killing...

319
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,450
...is not done by Xu Wei.

320
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,260
Besides,the old smith who makes the arrows had said...

321
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,520
...that it was a woman who hired him.

322
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,880
There is not a woman in Xu family...

323
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,480
...and yet all the evidence are pointing at them.

324
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,800
Don't you think that's strange?

325
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,720
Let's say,they are the mastermind behind all this,...

326
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,650
...how would they benefit from it?

327
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,540
First,the failed pawn robbery, then the failed Qi Yuan tomb case.

328
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,120
Now,they're being exposed of smuggling goods.

329
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,580
They are like a target bristled with arrows.

330
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,760
We couldn't find the bow nor the archer.

331
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,920
How can I be at ease?

332
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,960
Will we follow the smuggling case? -Of course,we have to.

333
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,440
Please,have a look.

334
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:05,360
Investigations showed that the owner of the car dealership...

335
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,440
...is related to the owner of the car service centre.

336
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,490
Xu Wei has made numerous money transfers to the car dealership.

337
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,560
When we catch them red-handed smuggling the goods,...

338
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:21,020
...we can investigate both car accident and smuggling cases.

339
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,600
The time has come for Xu Wei to pay the price.

340
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,880
Thank you,Mr. Zhuang, for being a good citizen.

341
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,240
You've done it again.

342
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,880
Is that so,Officer Miao?

343
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,570
If Xu Wei is convicted,I want to be the first to visit him.

344
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,960
Who would've thought a feeble liberal arts student...

345
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,240
...was able to provide clues.

346
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,210
You must have done a lot.

347
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,400
Did you do it for yourself or Qin Xuanbing?

348
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,360
Of course it's for Qin.....

349
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,240
Of course it's for the sake of justice.

350
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,520
Didn't you ask me to capture Xu Wei?

351
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,880
We're getting him,so what's with your expression?

352
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,440
Xiao Jia?

353
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,040
You..... -Liu Jia?

354
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,580
Who's ashes are those?

355
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,120
Feifei and Xiao Rui, please give us some space.

356
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,940
I have something to tell Huang Fuyun.

357
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,040
We have something to talk about,let's go.

358
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,200
Talk? What do we need to talk about?

359
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,280
Be gentle.

360
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,040
Haven't we finished talking? Is there more?

361
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,760
You're right,we're done talking. Let's take a break.

362
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,560
Take a break?

363
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,570
Didn't Huang Fuyun say that Liu Jia was ignoring him?

364
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,370
I don't think this is right.

365
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,560
Just listen in.

366
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,210
We can't do this.

367
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,440
What's wrong?

368
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,100
Do you.....

369
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,420
Do you not like the flowers I sent you?

370
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,640
You are my rose. A flower,you are.

371
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,480
I asked Feifei for your work address.

372
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,220
Do you not like surprises?

373
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,440
What happened to you?

374
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,090
I'm allergic to pollen.

375
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,800
I fainted after receiving the flowers...

376
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,760
...and almost died.

377
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,080
Do you think I like the surprise?

378
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,600
Feifei didn't mention that. Come,have a seat.

379
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:15,980
It can't be.

380
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,680
Is your allergy that severe?

381
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,040
Let me take care of you. -No way! You'll kill me.

382
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,440
How will I kill you?

383
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,160
Stop calling to pester me...

384
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,840
...and stop sending strange items to my workplace.

385
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,500
I'm begging you,Huang Fuyun!

386
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:36,770
Xiao Jia!

387
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,480
If you ask me out again,I will have Feifei break your legs.

388
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,290
Why would you break my legs?

389
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,880
That Xu Wei is good-for-nothing.

390
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,160
We'll take the money and leave after this task.

391
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,600
I'll use it to go overseas and have fun.

392
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,250
Brat,you only think about having fun.

393
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,260
Big brother,there's the police.

394
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,120
Don't worry,stay calm.

395
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,140
Please get off the car.

396
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,440
What's wrong? -Driver's license,please.

397
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,960
Don't move!

398
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:57,860
Search him.

399
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,650
Sister Fei,we caught them with the goods.

400
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,760
How did the police get involved?

401
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,160
I'm going back to Kiev to lay low in two days.

402
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,010
Are you alright?

403
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,320
I'm not sure. I went elsewhere so I'm currently safe.

404
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,260
Xiao wei hasn’t come back yet.

405
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,250
Why don't both of you come over and we'll leave together.

406
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,740
The situation is tense out there. The police are searching for us.

407
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,560
We'll meet tomorrow at 3 p.m.

408
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,400
Come alone to SiYuan Mansion.

409
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,640
We'll talk when we meet.

410
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,450
Alright.

411
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,330
Don't worry.

412
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,720
Sir,we found his location. I'll bring our men over.

413
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,780
Why would you go there?

414
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,720
Inform the police.

415
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,520
They'll reach there faster.

416
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,210
Yes,sir.

417
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,700
Miss Qin,you don't need to see me off.

418
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,680
You're still recovering. If you injure yourself again,...

419
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,610
...Zhuang Rui would come after me.

420
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,050
You're too kind,Officer Miao.

421
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,240
Qin Xuanbing!

422
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,480
Useless woman,how dare you report to the police on me?

423
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,760
If I die today, I will bring you with me!

424
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,680
I was going to catch you but you've served yourself on a plate.

425
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,610
Who are you bringing to death with a brain like yours?

426
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,380
I remember all your faces.

427
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,200
I will not let this go.

428
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,440
Move it!

429
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,440
Miss Qin.

430
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,600
Please don't see me off.

431
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:21,719
I won't be able to handle another knife-wielding troublemaker.

432
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,560
Officer Miao,I owe you one.

433
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,360
I'll personally repay this favour.

434
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,800
Okay,I'll leave now.

435
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,670
He has a feminine smell on him.

436
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:46,080
It was light. I think it was...

437
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,340
...the smell of amber.

438
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,929
Officer Miao,this is the smell of amber.

439
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,130
Have a sniff.

440
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,660
The smell of amber?

441
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:01,930
It's her.

442
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,520
Two dogs strive for a bone, the third runs away with it.

443
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,240
You used Zhuang Rui and the lady officer to capture Xu family.

444
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,480
At first,we were sure of making a loss.

445
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,520
However,with your effective strategy,...

446
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,450
...we will know double our profit.

447
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,320
Xi Huang Jewellery is breaking into the mainland market...

448
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,650
...and Xu family has paved the road for us.

449
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,040
A partner that is of no use can only be a stepping stone.

450
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,400
Sir.

451
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,780
What about Zhuang Rui?

452
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,520
The Ping Zhou auction was full of ups and downs.

453
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,290
It's a good thing...

454
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,650
...that the outcome was positive.

455
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,900
You gained much from gambling stones...

456
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,420
..and you made a name for yourself in the jade industry.

457
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,040
However,I wonder if you would still have the time...

458
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,850
...to accompany this old man around Panjiayuan.

459
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,400
Uncle De,how could you say that? You are my mentor.

460
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,370
I'm always learning new things when I'm with you.

461
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,600
I hope to learn more from you.

462
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,440
My friend gave me...

463
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,640
...ten pieces of Xuan Jade paper from the Guangxu period.

464
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,880
If you'd like to have it,I'll send them to you when it arrives.

465
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,640
Brat,you're making money now.

466
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,600
You're giving me 200,000 pieces just like that?

467
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,600
You don't want food or drink so I didn't know how to repay you.

468
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,500
When you drink water,don't forget the one who dug the well.

469
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,050
This is a little something from me.

470
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,880
That is the one who dug the well. -Uncle De,I'll get the door.

471
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,170
Manager Liu.

472
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,880
Xiao Zhuang.

473
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,520
Manager Liu,are you paying me visit?

474
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,840
Have a seat. -I didn't want to disturb you.

475
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,240
I tried calling but you never picked up.

476
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,720
So,I came over today.

477
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,240
I have something to ask of you. -What is it? Go ahead.

478
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,480
Xiao Zhuang,pour us something to drink.

479
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,480
I have something to discuss with Uncle De.

480
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,760
Manager Liu,I was just telling Xiao Rui..

481
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,080
..that age is catching up with me.

482
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,280
I'll settle the matters at hand and stop working after that.

483
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,680
I want to able to enjoy a cup of tea...

484
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,300
...and rear some insects.

485
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,040
If you need to look for me, I'll leave it to Xiao Rui...

486
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,440
..to take care of things.

487
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,000
Xiao Rui,am I right?

488
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,000
Uncle De.

489
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,680
We are not lacking of staff in our store.

490
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,500
Lacking of staff? Do you mean a salesperson?

491
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,480
Manager Liu,you have mistaken.

492
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,040
Xiao Rui is the owner of Ruiyunzhai.

493
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,560
Even if I ask for his help, he might not have time for me.

494
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,460
Uncle De,don't say that. That sounds critical.

495
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,400
I'm always here for you if you need me.

496
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,800
What a polite boss. -Please don't say that.

497
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,840
You are the owner of Ruiyunzhai?

498
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,120
You're the one who broke open the red jade at the Ping Zhou auction?

499
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,160
It's luck. Here,have some tea. -Let me do it.

500
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,200
Xiao Rui mentioned to not forget the one who dug the well.

501
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,320
What is there to remember? Some things are best  left forgotten.

502
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,680
Anyway,Xiao Zhuang. No,I mean Xiao Rui.

503
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,120
Director Zhuang? Director Zhuang.

504
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,360
A golden carp won't stay in the pond forever.

505
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,560
I knew that this young man...

506
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,240
...has a bright future,waiting for an opportunity to strike.

507
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,440
Leaving the pawnshop was a blessing in disguise.

508
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,500
I didn't even ask you to pay for that Tamamoku stone.

509
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:32,960
Tamamoku stone?
