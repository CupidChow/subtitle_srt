1
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,000
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 25

3
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,759
If we start the operation, it may damage the village.

4
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,560
Are you...

5
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,440
...afraid that the villagers will reject your suggestion?

6
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,520
You're right.

7
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,039
Can we ensure the safety of villagers if there is a fight?

8
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,680
I'll help them...

9
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,480
...but...

10
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,520
...I don't want innocent people to be injured.

11
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,280
Although the village head made some mistakes,...

12
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,440
...but the villagers can't suffer because of him.

13
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,000
Stop fighting!

14
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,480
If we agree to move,...

15
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,720
...each family will receive a large compensation.

16
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,160
For those who are willing to work,...

17
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,200
...you can work in the mine. -No way!

18
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,320
What did you do when you worked with Bo Gang?

19
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,040
Do I have to remind you again?

20
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,520
What did you do to Zhuang Rui and Miss Miao?

21
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,240
I don't think you need another reminder!

22
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,400
How many people did you kill?

23
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,360
You know it. If things get worse,...

24
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,480
...the police will start the investigation.

25
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,520
What are you going to do by then?

26
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,640
I'm sure you know it well.

27
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,840
It's our fault to keep your friends here.

28
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,720
You may punish us as you wish...

29
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,480
...but I can't move as my parents' graves are here.

30
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,400
I beg..... -Get lost!

31
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,880
Calm down!

32
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,079
We can talk it out.

33
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,160
You may tell us your problems,...

34
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,720
...we'll try to settle it. Is that okay?

35
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,160
Okay.

36
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,960
Since we've done our part,...

37
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,280
...we will not be courteous to those who aren't willing to move!

38
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,840
No.

39
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,720
I think they are quite pitiful,too.

40
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,800
Let's settle this matter amicably.

41
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,200
They just want to get more money from us.

42
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,880
I'm used to this. Stay out of it.

43
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,440
I found a river nearby. I think it is their water source.

44
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,520
If we don't plan it well, there'll be water pollution.

45
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,400
It may affect more than a village.

46
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,160
The nearby villages may be affected,too.

47
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,280
If things get worse,...

48
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,760
...it'll be hard for you to deal with your boss.

49
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,159
Fine,I don't want to make things worse,too.

50
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,240
I'll talk to my boss.

51
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,360
You must be careful in the mountain.

52
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,440
Follow Dama.

53
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,840
Don't worry. My friends have field experience,too.

54
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,280
Dama,take care of them in the mountain.

55
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,320
Yes,boss.

56
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,520
I don't mean to trouble you again.

57
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,920
I wanted to follow you...

58
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,040
...but my mother doesn't allow me to.

59
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
No worries. Stay home and wait for us.

60
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,440
There is nothing much that I can help.

61
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,640
However,I can rest my mind since Dama is going there,too.

62
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,159
I've prepared some food for you.

63
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,760
You may need them on the way.

64
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,000
You are so thoughtful. I'm hungry now.

65
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,800
The topography of the mountain is complex. Your must be careful.

66
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,640
Don't worry. This isn't the first time for us anyway.

67
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,520
It's almost time to leave. Have a safe trip.

68
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,360
Is this the only way there? -There is another way...

69
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,840
...but it's through the Death Valley.

70
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,320
However,I think it's the only way now.

71
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,520
Hurry up! I'll lead the way.

72
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,040
Is this the Death Valley?

73
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,200
It's also known as the Gate of Hell.

74
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,000
A few years ago,...

75
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,240
...a team leader of the mine went missing here.

76
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,120
Many people came to look for him but they failed.

77
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,480
His corpse was found after a long time.

78
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,320
His face looked horrifying but there wasn't any bodily wounds.

79
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,960
No one knows what had happened to him.

80
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,200
It's strange. There wasn't any wound...

81
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,200
...but it wasn't starvation,too. -I got it!

82
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,360
He was scared to death!

83
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,680
Do you hear that? Listen!

84
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,560
How long do we have to walk? I'm very tired!

85
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,800
Take a break first.

86
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,120
The food that we've brought can last for a few weeks.

87
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,320
Who wants to stay here for a few weeks? It isn't camping!

88
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,800
Take a break first. I'll look around.

89
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,040
Maniu!

90
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:39,760
Xiaorui.

91
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,560
If we can eat this every day, I'll stay here for a few weeks.

92
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,080
When can you stop embarrassing yourself?

93
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,000
You have no idea.

94
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,640
As rich,...

95
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,600
...we can't possibly have great food every day.

96
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,200
Life has to be fun.

97
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,480
The magnetic field is in chaos. The compass is not working,too.

98
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,040
If I'm not mistaken, phones are not functioning,too.

99
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,680
Does your phone have any signal?

100
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,760
There isn't any signal.

101
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,000
Let's go with the flow.

102
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,240
Eat the steamboat first.

103
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,160
Drink some water.

104
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,960
After they lose consciousness, we'll attack them.

105
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,600
Yes. I've drugged their food.

106
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,520
They'll lose consciousness soon.

107
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,760
We can't afford to make any mistake.

108
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,000
If it is necessary,.....

109
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,560
Yes.

110
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,880
They cheated us. The meat is poisoned.

111
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,560
Hu Rong wants to kill us in the mountain.

112
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,920
You go first. I'll take Xiaoyun. Let's move towards the North.

113
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,560
Where is my steamboat?

114
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,040
What is over there? Let's have a look.

115
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,080
Where is my steamboat? -Hurry up! Dama wants to kill us.

116
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:37,800
Why?

117
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,880
Let's go! -Catch them!

118
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,480
Send more men here! -Yes!

119
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,360
Be careful! Over here!

120
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,440
Hurry! Mind your step!

121
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,760
Xiaoyun,keep running! -Okay.

122
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,120
Let's split up!

123
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,000
Stop!

124
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,880
Stop!

125
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:36,800
Chase them!

126
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,560
Feifei!

127
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,000
Feifei!

128
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,520
Feifei!

129
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,360
There is a signal!

130
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:42,760
"I gained his trust." "The sheep was missing."

131
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,360
Zhuang Rui,how are you?

132
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,760
Zhuang Rui,are you okay?

133
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,520
Are you okay?

134
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,920
Zhuang Rui!

135
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,720
Let go!

136
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,880
Take your time. -Let go!

137
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,920
Zhuang Rui, did you lose your vision?

138
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,240
Zhuang Rui!

139
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Zhuang Rui,stop moving first.

140
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,120
Get up! -Stop moving!

141
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,600
Zhuang Rui,I'll bring you back.

142
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,440
Go!

143
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,320
Hold on. -They're over there! Hurry up!

144
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,840
Climb the tree. -It's too high! I can't do it!

145
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,280
Here.

146
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,760
I saw them just now!

147
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,040
They can't go far. Let's split up. -Yes.

148
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:57,680
Go!

149
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,320
Zhuang Rui.

150
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,360
What's wrong with you?

151
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,760
What's wrong with me? You may report it now!

152
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,720
The sheep is blind. You can do whatever you want!

153
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,560
What are you trying to say?

154
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,640
What else can it be?

155
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,640
Haven't you been reporting my situation?

156
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,440
I gained his trust. The sheep was missing.

157
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,120
The sheep is blind. You may catch him.

158
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,200
You saw the messages.

159
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,800
However,you've misunderstood. You aren't my target.

160
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,560
Who else can it be?

161
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,640
Is it the Qin family? Is it the police?

162
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,760
Is it the business rival? Is it Hu Rong?

163
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,080
Zhuang Rui,do you think I'll risk my life...

164
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,920
...in the jungle for Hu Rong? -Don't tell me that!

165
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,240
That is your mission!

166
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,520
It's none of my business!

167
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,560
From the beginning,...

168
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,040
...you came with a motive.

169
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,480
You've planned it,right?

170
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Yes,I have to admit that...

171
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,440
...I came with a motive.

172
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,320
However,no matter what it is,...

173
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,040
...I won't hurt you.

174
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,200
Grandpa Gu is right. Women are the most unpredictable.

175
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,560
Come.

176
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,280
Did you find them? -No.

177
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,320
No.

178
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,600
It's okay. As long as they are still in the mountain,...

179
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,320
...they can't run away. Let's go.

180
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,440
Xiaoyun,hurry!

181
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,200
Give it to me.

182
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,000
Are you okay? -I'm terrified.

183
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,520
Let's go.

184
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,600
Zhuang Rui.

185
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,520
Give it a try.

186
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:16,760
Zhuang Rui.

187
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,040
Zhuang Rui.

188
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,320
I know you don't want to be with me...

189
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,040
...but you are hungry and you can't see anything.

190
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,200
Where can you go?

191
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,320
Have a bite first. Here you go.

192
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,760
Zhuang Rui,I won't hurt you!

193
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,240
If I wanted to kill you, you would be dead by now.

194
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,440
I beg you. Please have a bite,okay?

195
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,960
I'll have the first bite.

196
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,000
Is it okay?

197
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,680
Please have a bite!

198
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,840
I'll leave the fruits here.

199
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,080
I found some wild mushrooms. After I light a fire,...

200
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,920
...we can make roasted mushroom.

201
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:42,960
Wait for me.

202
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,800
Walk slower!

203
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,160
Can you walk slower? I'm exhausted!

204
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,440
What are you doing?

205
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,520
How can you still have fun now?

206
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,040
I won't bother you. Let me take a break.

207
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:27,960
I'm exhausted!

208
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,200
What are you doing?

209
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,400
What is this? -This is Calamus.

210
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,000
It is usually found in the rainforest. There is water in it.

211
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,760
You can drink the water by putting it up.

212
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,360
It's sweet!

213
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,360
Xiaofei,you're so great!

214
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,320
I should keep some.

215
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,320
After we go back to Beijing, I'll discuss with Miss Xiaojia...

216
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,040
...to plan a show for you.

217
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,280
I think it will be a popular show.

218
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,680
We shall open an adventure tour agency for you.

219
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,080
Who knows if it can make more profit than Ruiyunzhai?

220
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,480
This is my idea. I want to be the manager.

221
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,280
I don't think you should be the manager.

222
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,640
What about a stand-up comedian since you like to talk?

223
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,120
Let's go. -No!

224
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,840
I'm exhausted and famished!

225
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,360
Then you stay here alone. I'll make a move.

226
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,400
No! I'm not like you!

227
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,280
You are a unique breed. You can live without food...

228
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,240
...but I'm human.

229
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,600
We've been walking for a whole day. I'm famished!

230
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,000
It's because you are rich. -You are right.

231
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,800
Why are we talking about this now?

232
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,960
Fei,I believe in you.

233
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,440
Since you can find water, please get me some food.

234
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,240
If Pengfei was here, he could hunt some animals.

235
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,000
I can't do that.

236
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,560
However,the roasted mushrooms...

237
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,120
...smell good! Give it a try.

238
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,120
It's done! Here you go.

239
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,280
Zhuang Rui.

240
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,000
How should I trust you?

241
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,560
Don't you...

242
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,040
...trust me at all?

243
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,680
All right,I got it.

244
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,600
I won't explain again. It's up to you whether you want to trust me.

245
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,920
Now...

246
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,960
...we'll move towards North.

247
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,040
After we reach there, I'll leave.

248
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,600
I won't disturb you again.

249
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,440
Since you aren't hungry,...

250
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,320
...let's go.

251
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,560
Then you can get rid of me soon.

252
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,080
We got it! We have food to eat now!

253
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,440
You're great!

254
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,840
We'll have chicken for dinner tonight!

255
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,920
Can we eat now? -It's almost done.

256
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,670
It smells so good!

257
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,150
It smells so good! Xiaofei,...

258
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,230
...it's so nice to stay with you!

259
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,320
You're crazy!

260
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,230
Give me the chicken wing.

261
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,190
Here you go. -That's the one!

262
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,040
I wonder how Xiaorui and Feifei are doing now.

263
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,440
Without you,...

264
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,280
...they definitely won't be able to enjoy this.

265
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:16,800
The fire is going out.

266
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,800
What are you doing? Damp wood will cause smoke...

267
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,720
...and give away our location. Why can't you just eat?

268
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,040
Stop giving me trouble!

269
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,440
Let's go! Hurry up!

270
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,440
I'm sorry!

271
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:52,760
Hurry!

272
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,320
I think they've just left. Go!

273
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,520
Didn't Pengfei ask us to move towards the North?

274
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,480
Yes! What's wrong?

275
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,600
It's nothing. -Let's go.

276
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,800
Move forward.

277
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,880
In the forest,where the trees have thick leaves,...

278
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,520
...a smooth bark, there's moss on the ground...

279
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,680
...and more grass is towards the South.

280
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,440
We're moving towards the South.

281
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,000
Xiaofei.

282
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,720
Have some fruits. I've tried it. It's delicious!

283
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,360
It's very sweet!

284
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,080
Didn't I warn you not to simply eat the food?

285
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,880
What's wrong? Why can't we eat the fruits?

286
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,760
Do you know what it is? -What is it?

287
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,200
It is Sea Mango. It is very poisonous.

288
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,920
What will happen? -You'll die.

289
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,160
I'm going to die!

290
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,520
It is called the Suicide Fruit in Myanmar.

291
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,960
After eating it, one will die within six hours.

292
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,320
What shall we do now? Please save me!

293
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,440
How much did you eat? -I only had two bites.

294
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,920
I'm going to die! I'm not even married with Miss Xiaojia!

295
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,080
Xiaofei,save me!

296
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,040
Hurry! Xiaoyun,eat this! -What's this? I'm going to die!

297
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,120
This is the root of Sugar Apple. It's a natural laxative.

298
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,040
It may help you to excrete before the Sea Mango is absorbed. Hurry!

299
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,440
If you excrete within 30 minutes, you'll be fine.

300
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,040
If not,tell me what you want to tell Liu Jia.

301
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,000
I'll deliver it to her.

302
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,480
Hurry up!

303
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,480
