1
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,500
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,500
Episode 20

3
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,440
This place...

4
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,479
...does not feel as grand as the jade market in China.

5
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,640
Yes,auctions like this...

6
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,320
...are a common sight in Myanmar.

7
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,080
They do not use grand venues to hold these events.

8
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,400
The jade markets here seem plain compared to jade markets in China.

9
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,040
In Myanmar,the jades on the markets...

10
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,440
...are of subpar quality. However,in auctions,...

11
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,960
...you will only see jades of the highest quality.

12
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,400
This is why many companies from China come to Myanmar...

13
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,840
...to get their hands on the jades in the auction...

14
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,440
...to make sure they have enough jade in their reserve.

15
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,360
This is the Burmese harp.

16
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,600
It evolved from the Chinese harp from the Tang Dynasty.

17
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,840
I'm impressed that you are knowledgeable about harps,too.

18
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,840
Miss,Mr. Qin calls for you. The auction is starting soon.

19
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,480
Let's go.

20
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,400
This way,please.

21
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,240
These are the best pieces in this auction.

22
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,320
I see that you are studying it closely...

23
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,560
...so you must be an expert.

24
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,000
No. I'm just here to see the world.

25
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,400
What a coincidence. I'm  here to see the world,too.

26
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,040
I have absolutely no knowledge about stones.

27
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:43,680
I don't which stone to invest my money on.

28
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,240
So,what do you recommend?

29
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,120
I dare not do that. I don't want to influence your judgement.

30
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,680
It's nothing serious. Just tell me...

31
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,159
...which stone do you think is the best?

32
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,360
These few stones are from famous old mines. They're good.

33
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,560
No. 303 is getting a lot of attention. What do you think?

34
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,760
Yes,No. 303 is a good stone.

35
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:24,200
Its base material and surface looks promising.

36
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,520
I can say that it's worth gambling on.

37
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,280
The competition will be fierce among the experts today.

38
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,240
How much will I earn if I buy it?

39
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,720
It's hard to say. There're many buyers here...

40
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,680
...who will definitely bid on this.

41
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,360
The starting price would be RMB 70 million.

42
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,080
It could go even higher.

43
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,280
That's a high price.

44
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,920
However,if you're only here to try your luck,...

45
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,040
...you should bid on other stones.

46
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,920
All right. I'll heed your advice.

47
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,040
Welcome to the natural stones auction.

48
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,400
Up next is the collection that has been carefully selected,...

49
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,440
...our five pieces of jade stones.

50
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,240
I invite our guests to have a look.

51
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,480
What do you think?

52
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,840
I have studied these stones earlier.

53
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,360
They are all stones from the old mines.

54
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,440
Their base material and surfaces looks promising.

55
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,240
Especially No. 303.

56
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,040
It's a worthy investment.

57
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,560
However,I would suggest to bid on.....

58
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,960
Let's talk outside.

59
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,240
There are many people inside. We need to be careful.

60
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,549
Uncle Qin is indeed wise.

61
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,240
All right,go ahead.

62
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,440
Please bid on No. 129 if you have to.

63
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,920
I remember that stone. It's darker in colour

64
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,000
Yes.

65
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,840
The surface of that stone is not something extraordinary.

66
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,080
Yes,that stone does not stand out.

67
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,040
However,its surface is covered with black moss...

68
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,440
...and it has a streak of tuft in the middle.

69
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,240
THere is a hint of purple in the streak of tuft...

70
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,640
...and the purple looks yellowish.

71
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,880
What does it mean?

72
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,080
I've opened up a stone with purple jade before.

73
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,760
The purple streak has a yellow crystal within.

74
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,200
This means that it is possible to open up a quality purple jade.

75
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,520
I noticed this when I first opened up the purple jade...

76
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,360
...so I can't go wrong.

77
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,720
How does it compare with No. 303?

78
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:57,280
They're on the same par. However,...

79
00:09:59,400 --> 00:09:59,840
...No. 129 could be better.

80
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,360
Father,Zhuang Rui has never been wrong.

81
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,280
All right. We'll go with No. 129.

82
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,600
Add on 50% to the reserved price.

83
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,280
No. 303 could have the most bid.

84
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,800
Looking at that exquisite stone,...

85
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,640
...it's not about bidding or not,...

86
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,000
...it's about how much one is willing is bid.

87
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,960
The bidding price would be very high.

88
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,920
Although the profit will be compromised,...

89
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,640
...there is the assurance of our reserve.

90
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,040
Look at No. 185. -What do you think about No. 129?

91
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,840
I was going to explain each stone to you.

92
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,000
Since you mentioned No. 129, let's talk about it.

93
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,680
I have studied it and it isn't valuable.

94
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,200
Boss,you're the expert.

95
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,880
You come out the top in the bidding every year.

96
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,720
I notice that you have been eyeing No. 129

97
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,120
...did you perhaps discover anything?

98
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,160
Should I check the stone again?

99
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,920
I studied it closely but I studied a person,not a stone.

100
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,480
Since you say so,...

101
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,400
...we'll bid on No. 303.

102
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:26,880
I understand.

103
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,200
The Myanmar Jade Auction will be closing...

104
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,600
...its bid. Please submit your bids...

105
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,160
...now. Bids submitted after the time is up will be rejected.

106
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,080
You go check on it.

107
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,960
The time to submit bids is up. I will announce the results soon.

108
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,600
Feifei, you are a woman after all.

109
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,600
Look at the photos you took. I look so ugly!

110
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,800
At least you look like a human being.

111
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,560
That's a personal attack.

112
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,120
You are always.....

113
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,520
Thief! -Please make way!

114
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,960
Catch the thief!

115
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,440
Catch the thief!

116
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,000
Don't let him get away! Catch him!

117
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,800
Catch the thief!

118
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,720
Come back!

119
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,240
Thank you.

120
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,760
How do I know it's yours? -Hold the phone up.

121
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,280
Scan my face with it.

122
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,560
Thank her. -Thank you.

123
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,320
Don't mention it. You must be from China.

124
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,360
Hi,I'm Hu Wen. -Hi.

125
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,360
Hi,I'm Miao Feifei. -Hi.

126
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,200
You don't have to know his name.

127
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,080
Huang Fuyun. -What are you doing here?

128
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,160
We're just walking around. -It's dangerous.

129
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,320
Why don't I bring you around?

130
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,560
I'm all right with that. -Sure.

131
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,800
Let's go. -That thief.

132
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,000
I'll beat him up if I see him. -You asked for it.

133
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:01,920
We're going this way.

134
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,840
Please remain in your seats. We will announce the bid winners.

135
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,640
Bid No. 405,the bidding price is RMB 37 million.

136
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,520
The wining bid goes to J&K Jewellery Group.

137
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,040
Bid No. 129,the bidding price is RMB 53 million.

138
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,800
The wining bid goes to Xi Huang Jewellery.

139
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,520
Bid No. 303,the bidding price is RMB 90.5 million.

140
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,440
The wining bid goes to Hu Jewellery Group.

141
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:46,680
Congratulations.

142
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,040
We congratulate Hu Jewellery Group on becoming the Bidding Champion.

143
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,200
I didn't expect you to slice the stone open now.

144
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,840
I trust you.

145
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,440
If there is purple jade inside, Xi Huang Jewellery...

146
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,560
...will shine at this auction.

147
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,080
Get ready. Slice it up.

148
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,520
Congratulations, it's a purple jade.

149
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,920
You have a discerning eye.

150
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,040
Goodness,they opened up purple jade.

151
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,800
It's an ice jade.

152
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,240
It's an elegant shade of purple.

153
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,720
I can't believe that the plain No. 129...

154
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,320
...would have purple jade inside.

155
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,360
It's worth at least RMB 100 million.

156
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,589
It's more than that. If made into accessories,...

157
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,800
...the amount will be tenfold.

158
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,960
Mr. Qin got lucky this time.

159
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:17,160
Did you say luck?

160
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,589
I'd say he has someone helping him.

161
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:25,000
They strike it this time.

162
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,880
Thank you for your help today. You have a good stamina.

163
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,920
It's nothing. Did you enjoy yourselves?

164
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,600
If it weren't for you, we wouldn't know where to go.

165
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,200
The good thing about having a local guide is these.

166
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,640
Boss,please give me a coconut.

167
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,200
Are you sure that Liu Jia will like these?

168
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,200
You must trust my good taste.

169
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,880
Hu Wen,do join us for a meal.

170
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,320
You can tell me more about Myanmar...

171
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,200
...and its specialty. -Today?

172
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,040
Why don't both of you come by my family's manor tomorrow?

173
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,040
It has a great view. -Sure. A manor.

174
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,480
I've never seen a Myanmar manor. We have two more friends.

175
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,960
Can they come,too? -Of course.

176
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,400
I will send a car to pick you up tomorrow.

177
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,280
How could you agree to her just like that?

178
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,040
Zhuang Rui might be busy. -Is that so?

179
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,800
He is stuck with the ice mountain for two days.

180
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,640
Ice mountain? What ice mountain?

181
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,880
You know,that ice mountain.

182
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,200
The thing is,my friend is stuck on ice mountain.

183
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,520
He won't be able to make it.

184
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,760
My other friend has been gloomy since coming to Myanmar.

185
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,280
He will not be fun but both of us will be there.

186
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,680
Great. So it's settled then.

187
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,760
If there's nothing else, I'll leave now.

188
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,600
I will send a car tomorrow. -All right. See you tomorrow.

189
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,000
Bye. -Bye.

190
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,400
Why did you agree to her just like that?

191
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,560
Did I agree to go?

192
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,280
I think I smell sour jealousy.

193
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,200
That is the smell of your coconut turning sour.

194
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,280
Have some of this.

195
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,560
No. -It's really delicious.

196
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,720
Brother, it's been so many years.

197
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,320
I have finally come to your resting place.

198
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,440
May you rest in peace.

199
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,520
This time,I will..... -Congratulations.

200
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,800
You opened up a purple jade.

201
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,960
You're the star of the day.

202
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,200
I'm flattered.

203
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,680
Miss Hu is once again the Bidding Champion.

204
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,280
You are the real star of the day.

205
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,520
Boss Hu? You are Boss Hu?

206
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,760
What about.....

207
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,960
Young man, you have a discerning eye.

208
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,240
It's a pity I didn't listen to you and missed the jade.

209
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,240
What is this?

210
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,040
You have met each other?

211
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,120
I met Boss Hu when I was studying the stones.

212
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,120
She,no, Boss Hu is a nice person.

213
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,560
Yes. Miss Hu is always up to tricks.

214
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,680
Zhuang Rui, you'll get used to it.

215
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,280
I wanted to introduce her to you last night...

216
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,560
...but she was just too busy and couldn't make it.

217
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,800
I'm sorry about that. I was tied up with work.

218
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,600
What about this,I'll have a dinner just for you at my manor.

219
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,080
What a pity. I have business to attend...

220
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,080
...so I can't make it.

221
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,720
You've already opened up a purple jade...

222
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,800
...yet you're still greedy for more.

223
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,160
The supply for jade in China cannot meet the demand.

224
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,720
Xi Huang Jewellery doesn't have its own jade mine like you...

225
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,760
...so we have to work harder...

226
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,760
...to make sure we have the reserve.

227
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,320
Young man,are you interested to visit...

228
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,040
...my family's jade mine?

229
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,600
I.....

230
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,680
Don't worry. Brother Qin is open-minded.

231
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,720
He will not stop you from making new friends,will he?

232
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,520
Zhuang Rui,...

233
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,760
...Boss Hu admires your talent and invited you.

234
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,880
You should go and have a look.

235
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,880
I have never seen a jade mine anyway,so.....

236
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,920
All right,I will send a car tomorrow.

237
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,840
Thank you.

238
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
Miss Qin,your harp.

239
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,800
I did not bid on this harp.

240
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,760
Zhuang Rui.

241
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,560
You kept looking at the harp so I bid it for you.

242
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,800
Someone once told me that...

243
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,960
...if you have what you want, you will find happiness.

244
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,120
I agree with the second half.

245
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,320
I hope that you will find your happiness.

246
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,720
I didn't know that you have this side of you.

247
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,080
I hope you like it. -Thank you.

248
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,360
Xiaorui.

249
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,800
Let me tell you,don't simply take photos in Myanmar.

250
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,760
It's extremely dangerous.

251
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,800
Why? What did you do this time?

252
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,040
I didn't do anything. My phone almost got snatched.

253
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,520
It's a good thing that I met a pretty lady who.....

254
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,000
There's no such thing. Just ignore him.

255
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,720
So,how was it today?

256
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,760
We did all right today. It's luck.

257
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,640
Luck? Zhuang Rui, you are a humble man.

258
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,760
The purple jade that we sliced open today is worth a lot.

259
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,400
I should thank you and Uncle Qin's trust in me.

260
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,000
No one can rival Xiaorui.

261
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,160
I still have to thank you. If it wasn't for you,...

262
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,000
...we wouldn't have the purple jade.

263
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,080
That piece of jade is hard-to-find in the market.

264
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,240
I'm really grateful for you.

265
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,560
I have to thank you for giving that harp to me.

266
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,960
I like it a lot.

267
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,760
My father doesn't allow me to spend my energy...

268
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,280
...on non-work related things. So thank you.

269
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,400
Don't mention it. You are destined to have it.

270
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,360
I'm just helping it find its rightful owner.

271
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,000
The harp is more valuable to me than the violet jade.

272
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:59,080
Xiaoyun,the expensive things that I bought today,...

273
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,920
...where are they?

274
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:08,400
The expensive things that you bought today are all in your room.

275
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,560
Don't worry.

276
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,200
I befriended the Jade Master today.

277
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,720
She invited us to her house and visit the jade mine.

278
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,080
So if you're interested, let's go together.

279
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,680
Jade mine? Sure! I've never seen one.

280
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,040
I have to accompany my father for events tomorrow.

281
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,600
Zhuang Rui will be lonely. Why don't all of you go,too?

282
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,560
Let's go together. -We have something on tomorrow.

283
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,800
We're not free. -We're not free.

284
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,000
You're not free? What are you doing?

285
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,240
Are you the only one who can make friends here?

286
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,760
Are you the only one busy one?

287
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,920
Can't we make new friends in Myanmar,too?

288
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,320
We're invited to her house tomorrow,right?

289
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,440
You're going,too? -Yes,we're going together.

290
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,640
All right. I'll ask Pengfei to accompany me.

291
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,040
Where did you enjoy yourself last night?

292
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,920
No,I went to the temple and prayed.

293
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,240
There are a lot of temples here.

294
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,360
I wanted to ask you,...

295
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,280
...did you make the new friend yesterday?

296
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,920
It's none of your business. Can't I make new friends?

297
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,400
No,it's not that. What is your friend's name?

298
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:45,000
You only think about Miss Qin. Why do you care?

299
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,240
You can't say it like that. I like the name Huang Fuyun.

300
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,280
Pengfei is a good name. Miao Feifei is a wonderful name.

301
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,640
Our ride is here.

302
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,600
We're leaving first.

303
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,000
Xiaorui.

304
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,800
You arrived earlier than I expected.

305
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,960
I'm surprised,too.

306
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,840
So this is your home?

307
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,160
Great,it looks similar to our house.

308
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,200
Since we are both rich people.

309
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,720
You're interesting.

310
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,320
There's even a hot spring!

311
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,520
How is it? Do you feel tired already?

312
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,760
If you're not,I'll give you a tour around the place.

313
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,080
Sure,let's do that. -We'll tour around the house.

314
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,160
Our family's jade mine is not far from here.

315
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,560
I'll take you there after our meal.

316
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:11,880
Jade mine?

317
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,560
Sure!

318
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,000
Feifei,have a seat.

319
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,160
I'll pour you a drink. -Please don't trouble yourself.

320
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,120
I hope you had a smooth ride. My daughter,Wenwen,...

321
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,840
...will take you around.

322
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,680
Wenwen. -Mother.

323
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,880
What are you doing here?

324
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,320
I should ask you that.

325
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,080
What are you doing here?

326
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,560
Mother,these two are my friends.

327
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,200
Nice to meet you,aunt. -Nice to meet you,aunt.

328
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,120
Wenwen told me that her friends are visiting the jade mine today.

329
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,600
So all of you know each other?

330
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,640
Let us sit while we talk. Have a seat.

331
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,640
This is Mr. Zhuang Rui.

332
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,600
This is Wenwen,my daughter. -Hi.

333
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,800
Hi.

334
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,080
I'm surprised that young people are interested in mining area.

335
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,360
You might be disappointed as there's not much to see there.

336
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,560
That won't happen. I grew up around mining area...

337
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,840
...so I know the best places.

338
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,080
Feifei,I'll take you there.

339
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:48,280
In the early years,the stones at the Myanmar auction...

340
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,520
...are mostly from this mine.

341
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,560
The Hu family business is built on the jade mine.

342
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,960
However,the area has been mined to depletion these two years.

343
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,520
Our jewellery are following the changing trends,too.

344
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,040
Yes,I will introduce someone to you later.

345
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,040
He is our exploration expert...

346
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,840
...and a huge contributor to the Hu family.

347
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,440
I'm sure both of you will find a lot to talk about.

348
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,400
It's an honour to learn from a senior in the industry.

349
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,000
I know. The person that my mother look upon highly...

350
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,320
...must be Old Zhou.

351
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,720
Who's Old Zhou?

352
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,440
Where's your manners?

353
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,720
Uncle Zhou doesn't mind me calling him that.

354
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,280
Zhuang Rui,let me introduce you. -Director Hu.

355
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:00,080
This is Old Zhou, huge contributor of the Hu family.

356
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,400
He used to be a Professor of Geology.

357
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,600
It took a lot of effort to persuade him to join us.

358
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,640
Professor Zhou, nice to meet you.

359
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,160
There's no need to address me like that.

360
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,200
That was all in the past.

361
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,960
Xiaozhuang, you can call me Old Zhou.

362
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:25,320
Please don't say that. I'll call you Uncle Zhou.

363
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,520
Sure,you can call me whatever you like.

364
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:33,680
Xiaozhuang,Director Hu said that you're interested in antiques.

365
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,080
She was impressed by you many times.

366
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:41,080
It's my first seeing her singing praises for someone.

367
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,080
You're young and have a bright future ahead of you.

368
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,880
Director Hu,you flatter me.

369
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,600
I still have a lot to learn from the both of you.

370
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,560
Feel free to learn as much as you want around here.

371
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,760
Director Hu,take a look at the test result.

372
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:01,760
Look at this data.

373
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,760
Miss Hu,you should have given me a notice.

374
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,560
If I had known,I would dress up before coming here.

375
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,720
It's nothing. Make yourself at home.

376
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,120
What? Make myself...

377
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,560
...at home?

378
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,480
That picture was taken when I was about four years old.

379
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:44,480
My mother was always busy so I seldom see her.

380
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,240
I would look at this picture whenever I missed her.

381
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,320
My father left us when I was young.

382
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,400
My mother wanted me to have a good life...

383
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,600
...so she worked all day.

384
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,200
I couldn't understand her when I was younger,...

385
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,440
...but now I do.

386
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,680
I wish she wouldn't be so busy,...

387
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,520
...but she feels restless if she has nothing to do.

388
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,920
Both of you have a good relationship.

389
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,800
It's not like that. Let's talk about something else.

390
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,760
I have something to ask you. -What is it?

391
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,200
Is Zhuang Rui the one...

392
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:38,520
...whom you said was stuck to the ice mountain?

393
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,040
No.

394
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,000
They just happen to share the same name,that's all.

395
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,280
That's not what you said earlier.

396
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,880
What does she mean? -You were talking to her.

397
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,280
How would I know?

398
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,320
A rising new talent in the jade industry.

399
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,520
He's reliable and has good standards.

400
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,760
I wonder,...

401
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:11,190
...why doesn't my mother take him under her wings?

402
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,520
This rising new talent is too dazzling.

403
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,800
Your mother would need to get in line for that.

404
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:22,630
You're right. Let us matchmake Feifei and Zhuang Rui.

405
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:25,760
Huang Fuyun!

406
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,400
What's wrong?

407
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,160
Take a look at this data. We still need to confirm it.

408
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,640
What is this?

409
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,480
This is the topographic map of the whole mining area.

410
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,680
We only have the rights to mine certain areas.

411
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,680
There are two veins here.

412
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,480
Old Zhou and I have been exploring several spots for six months.

413
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,400
Old Zhou,are the results of the exploration out?

414
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:08,800
The results for the LCMS and grinding flow are out.

415
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,000
How is it?

416
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,800
We failed again.

417
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:25,920
Director Hu,I have another batch of data.

418
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,800
Maybe the results will be good this time.

419
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,560
Old Zhou is a good man.

420
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,000
Let him take you around the mining area.

421
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,280
The two of you can exchange ideas then.

422
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,560
Isn't Wenwen taking all of you to visit the mining area?

423
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,920
She must be happy to have many friends around.

424
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,400
Enjoy yourselves and we'll talk again.

425
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,800
Director Hu, you're a good person.

426
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,680
The mining area can be dangerous so be careful.

427
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,440
I can't take this anymore.

428
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,480
Are you all right?

429
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,000
Is it that bad?

430
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,240
Are you okay?

431
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,440
The road is not smooth so motion sickness in normal.

432
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,120
Why is the Kachin Hills valley closed?

433
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,440
The Kachin Hills valley is rumoured to have evil spirits...

434
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,040
...so my mother ordered for it to be closed.

435
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,120
You believe such things?

436
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,560
I heard that some young men went hunting a few years back.

437
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,280
Ten days later, only one man came back.

438
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,440
He had lost his mind.

439
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,280
He kept talking about a man-eating beast...

440
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,520
...with long fangs...

441
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,480
...that could snap your neck off with one bite.

442
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,240
I also heard that this beast likes to attack...

443
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,480
...those who sit on the ground.

444
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,280
Please don't say anymore. I feel like I've been bitten.

445
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,200
Why does it hurt? -It's not that.

446
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,040
Didn't you realise that you were sitting on this stone?

447
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,280
This stone.....

448
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,920
What is it? Did I sit on a high quality jade?

449
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,480
Indeed.

450
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,000
I was just joking around. Are you sure?

451
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,400
It is indeed a purple jade.

452
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,600
It's too small to make an accessory out of it...

453
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,600
...but you can keep it as a souvenir.

454
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,680
Lady luck is smiling on me!

455
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,440
This means that I will become rich soon!

456
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,160
You don't feel like throwing up anymore?

457
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,520
This is found in Huwen's home. What's it to do with you?

458
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,320
Miss Hu,I believe that this stone is my lucky stone.

459
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,560
Name your price.

460
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,960
If Zhuang Rui didn't see that it was a purple jade,...

461
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,480
...it would have been just another common stone.

462
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,200
You can keep it if you want.

463
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,920
However,we have never produced purple mine before.

464
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,440
Where did it come from?

465
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,880
How far are we from the mining area?

466
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:03,960
We're near.

467
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,560
We'll talk when we get there.

468
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:08,760
Sure.
