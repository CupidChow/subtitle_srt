1
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,000
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 39

3
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,880
So many people just to catch us?

4
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,200
Hand me the item.

5
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,440
Are you crazy?

6
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,400
You have two choice.

7
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,800
One,let us go.

8
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,320
Two,we'll all die together.

9
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,120
Go!

10
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,000
I'll bring her back here. -No need.

11
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,960
Don't be rash.

12
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,560
Hand over the Tamamoku stone...

13
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,850
...and you might be given a lighter sentence.

14
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,640
Mr. Zhuang,I promised you.

15
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,760
When this is all over, I will explain everything...

16
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,960
...about Mr. Gu.

17
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,160
Let's talk elsewhere.

18
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,360
I didn't kill Mr. Gu.

19
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,160
Grandfather Gu received your text message before he died.

20
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,240
I want to know about the expedition.

21
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,920
Come to Room 102.

22
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,960
Nakagawa Ryosuke.

23
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,040
Do you remember that?

24
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,880
I was at Lingyun Tea House with Grandfather Gu.

25
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,080
He went down after reading your text and got killed.

26
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,960
I can't think of anyone else besides you...

27
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,220
...who could have committed this crime.

28
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,960
Such a perfect crime.

29
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,400
I'll admit that I went to Lingyun Tea House that day.

30
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,560
I want to know about the expedition.

31
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,360
I'll be at Lingyun Tea House, Room 102,5.15 p.m.

32
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,680
Sent by Gu Tianfeng?

33
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,320
I went to the tea house as agreed.

34
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,000
When I opened the door to Room 102,...

35
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,680
...all I saw was Mr. Gu's dead body.

36
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,360
We're five minutes late. This is impolite.

37
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,760
Mr. Gu.

38
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,680
I'm sorry,Mr. Gu.

39
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,159
Fine,let's say what you said was true.

40
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,200
If both you and Grandfather Gu went to the room at 5.15 p.m.,...

41
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,330
How would the murder have taken place?

42
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,420
How could the murderer have escaped?

43
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,360
It's because I arrived late that day.

44
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,320
The five minute delay...

45
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,720
...caused Mr. Gu's death...

46
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,200
...and I became a suspect.

47
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,880
If you're not guilty, why did you escape to Kiev?

48
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,240
I did not escape to Kiev.

49
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,680
I had a feeling...

50
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,720
...that the text message and Mr. Gu's death are planned.

51
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,520
I worry for the Tamamoku stone so I flew to Kiev...

52
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,020
...and kept it in a safe place.

53
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,250
Although I'm not the murderer,...

54
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,120
...I wasn't able to prove my innocence.

55
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,549
There has been a regret in my heart ever since.

56
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,320
Mr. Zhuang.

57
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,800
Someone used text messages to lure us to the same room.

58
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,280
After the murder, he put the blame on me.

59
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,400
The one who sent the messages is the real culprit.

60
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,960
Two messages.

61
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,410
Both mentioned the expedition back then.

62
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,120
What happened at the expedition...

63
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,120
...that made you and Grandfather Gu fall for this?

64
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,130
What does Nakagawa Ryosuke does for a living?

65
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,050
He has such a grand Japanese-style villa in Kiev.

66
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,320
The antiquities we saw earlier are expensive.

67
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,280
Mr. Nakagawa is an avid collector.

68
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,520
They're not all collected by Mr. Nakagawa Ryosuke.

69
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,200
Some of it are left by his father,Mr. Nakagawa Yohei.

70
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,010
Look at that.

71
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,960
His father is rich and he is rich,too. Great.

72
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,380
Nakagawa Yohei was interested in Chinese culture.

73
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,860
He joined excursions in China as a young man.

74
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,120
He mostly did archaeological work.

75
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,520
When he returned,he founded the Nakagawa Corporation.

76
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,480
What business is the Nakagawa family doing?

77
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,440
Mainly properties,electronics and export business.

78
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,280
Of course,there's the antiques business.

79
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,120
What a coincidence. We're young and share the same ambitions.

80
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,880
I think he and I should become friends.

81
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,280
We have an antiques shop at Panjiayuan Antique Market.

82
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,140
You're welcome to visit anytime.

83
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,600
Don't mind him. He's excited about money.

84
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,690
It's just the way he's programmed.

85
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,000
You said Nakagawa Yohei was an excellent archaeologist.

86
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,360
Why didn't he continue research work when he returned...

87
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,960
...but chose to do business?

88
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,880
Did anything happen in between?

89
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,560
Please come with me.

90
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,600
40 years ago,my grandfather Zhuang Qiming was in Gansu.

91
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,120
He disappeared mysteriously and without a trace.

92
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,320
I suspect that he has been murdered.

93
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,880
The murderer must be someone who was with him last.

94
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,200
Mr. Nakagawa, do you know who that is?

95
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,560
That's your father.

96
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,960
Nakagawa Yohei.

97
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,520
So,...

98
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,570
...this is my speculation.

99
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,640
Your father killed my grandfather...

100
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,690
...due to unexplained reason.

101
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,280
Grandfather Gu finally figured it out.

102
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,640
You wanted to cover up the truth...

103
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,480
...and chose to kill him.

104
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,440
Do you have proof?

105
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,960
After my grandfather disappeared,...

106
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,480
...your father fled to Japan.

107
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,560
If that's not the case,...

108
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,120
...why do you always bring up the expedition...

109
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,900
...and are hung up on about my grandfather's death?

110
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,560
Mr. Zhuang,have a seat.

111
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,720
Your speculation sounds plausible.

112
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,920
Unfortunately,you're mistaken.

113
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,320
My father didn't return to Japan to flee,...

114
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,090
...he was running for his life.

115
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,080
Running for his life?

116
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,400
My father was a different man when returned home.

117
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,840
He confessed under my mother's persistence.

118
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,480
Someone was coming after him...

119
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,280
...in China.

120
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,730
He wouldn't divulge into the details.

121
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,920
We only know that the person is a Chinese.

122
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,560
I suspect it's your grandfather,Zhuang Qiming.

123
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,800
I've gone through my father's journal.

124
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,720
He recorded about an incident in a tomb.

125
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,200
My father and your grandfather escape together.

126
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,320
After that,my father returned to Japan...

127
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,380
...while your grandfather disappeared into thin air.

128
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,800
I have a reason to believe...

129
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,720
...that your grandfather went into hiding to escape the law.

130
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,000
Impossible! My grandfather wouldn't do that!

131
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,400
How well do you know him?

132
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,520
He doesn't have a motive.

133
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,200
Motive?

134
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,730
Of course,there's one.

135
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,240
My father has something that your grandfather wanted.

136
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,440
This is something...

137
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,530
...you have as well.

138
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,200
What is it?

139
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,800
It's your pair of eyes.

140
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,800
The Golden Eyes?

141
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,120
You call them the Golden Eyes? Interesting.

142
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,080
Why does a follower need a sword?

143
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,040
Why is a tomboy drinking tea?

144
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,600
I like the tea.

145
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,520
Is this sword expensive?

146
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,320
The sword is priceless.

147
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,680
It's a 13th century sword made in Kamakura city.

148
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,720
Only a few exists in the world. It's the finest.

149
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,880
I'm impressed.

150
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,280
The Golden Eyes earned my father his first pot of gold.

151
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,080
When I was born,...

152
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,320
...my family has accumulated great wealth.

153
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,640
Later,symptoms started showing in my father's body.

154
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,360
He lost the ability to taste.

155
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,460
His vision became blurry.

156
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,360
Gradually, his hearing deteriorated.

157
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,320
Lastly,he lost all five senses.

158
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,080
The Japanese has a saying, cherry blossom has 7 days.

159
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,720
It means that a beautiful life is short.

160
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,960
Just like a life with the Golden Eyes.

161
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,680
My father sought help from ophthalmologist and neurologist.

162
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,980
They agreed that this is a change in the optic nerves...

163
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,680
...that affects one's focus...

164
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,700
...which causes hallucinations...

165
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,820
...and switching between 2D and 3D reality.

166
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,600
Advanced science explained that this is what made him...

167
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:58,000
...capable of seeing items in detail,just like you.

168
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,000
Well,...

169
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,760
...your father.....

170
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,500
Did your father succumb to the side effects of the Golden Eyes?

171
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,720
My father obtained the Golden Eyes during the excursion.

172
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,200
This is why I suspect your grandfather.

173
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:29,040
Of course,this is all in the past.

174
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,560
Who's the evil mastermind?

175
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,040
We'll never find out.

176
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,620
What about this possibility?

177
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,080
When my grandfather and your father...

178
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,940
...escaped from the tomb,...

179
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,360
...there was a third person.

180
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,280
I've thought of this.

181
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,960
Someone killed your grandfather and was after my father.

182
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,840
When he has been exposed, he killed Mr. Gu...

183
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,240
...to cover up the truth.

184
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,520
I carried out extensive investigation on this.

185
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,960
What did you find out?

186
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,880
The third person does not exist.

187
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,080
There's an earthy smell.

188
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,680
You're talking about the amber smell in the incense.

189
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,520
You don't seem to like the smell.

190
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,880
I've smelled this scent on Miss Qin.

191
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,600
Are you talking about Qin Xuanbing?

192
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,600
Yes.

193
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,640
This smell is called ambergris in the East.

194
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,720
It has always been an expensive incense.

195
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,160
Few people like this unique smell.

196
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,600
I didn't expect Miss Qin and I to like the same thing.

197
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,400
Qin family must've some influence in the Yunnan auction.

198
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,280
Yes.

199
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,400
However,Feifei has investigated Grandfather Gu's murder.

200
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,530
Qin family is not involved.

201
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,970
Perhaps,only by finding the truth about the past...

202
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,720
...will our questions be answered.

203
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,200
Right.

204
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,610
May I have a look at the Tamamoku stone?

205
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,080
Sure.

206
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,180
This stone,...

207
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,320
...be it the colour or density, there's nothing special.

208
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,920
To the naked eye, it's just a common stone.

209
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,280
Would Mr. Zhuang have a look at it?

210
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,680
When I looked at this stone at Victor's museum,...

211
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,010
...I thought it was odd.

212
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,600
There's only a small black spot in the middle.

213
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,920
Mr. Zhuang,your Golden Eyes are impressive.

214
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,380
Have a seat.

215
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:32,970
Please,sit.

216
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,000
How is your injury? -I'm much better.

217
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,240
Thanks to Mr. Zhuang's friend who wrapped my injury.

218
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,600
I'll let Victor tell you about it.

219
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,480
Nakagawa asked me to do a thorough research...

220
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,840
...on the stone using advanced technology.

221
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,700
Mr. Zhuang, you've seen it yourself.

222
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,360
The stone itself isn't special,...

223
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,640
...but it's the microscopic foreign object.

224
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,810
The foreign object is.....

225
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,000
Initially,I thought...

226
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,560
...that it's a mineral trapped inside.

227
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:31,000
However,upon research,...

228
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,180
...I detected strong radiation in the foreign object.

229
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,440
The radiation is stable if it stays inside the stone.

230
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,320
Once it's exposed to air,...

231
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,090
...the radiation will be emitted.

232
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,240
This radiation will affect the human brain nerves.

233
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,450
It will cause the body to undergo changes.

234
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,080
The changes usually start from the eyes.

235
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,320
Firstly,you will obtain the Golden Eyes.

236
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,880
However,as time goes by,...

237
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,120
...the rest of your organs will deteriorate...

238
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,890
...until you succumb to it.

239
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,840
Is there a cure...

240
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,200
...for the side effects of the Golden Eyes?

241
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,400
I'm sorry. There isn't.

242
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,080
However,there's no cure 40 years ago but today,...

243
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,610
...nothing is impossible.

244
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,920
We need to find out the origin...

245
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:13,800
...of the Golden Eyes.

246
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,920
My father also carried out his own research.

247
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,080
He left behind...

248
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,130
...valuable information.

249
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,300
Is there a clue?

250
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,000
He made a mark...

251
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,080
...on a cave temple in Gansu.

252
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,320
Where's the cave temple?

253
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,360
This cave temple might be the key to the Golden Eyes.

254
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,010
However,the location and content of the cave temple...

255
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,500
...weren't recorded.

256
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,960
I've sent men to look for it but found nothing.

257
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,800
I wonder...

258
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,360
...if the power of the Golden Eyes...

259
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,320
...could yield a better search result.

260
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,760
Would Mr. Zhuang be willing to join me?

261
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,120
Maybe we could find the truth in the cave temple...

262
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,940
...and ways to stop the side effects of the Golden Eyes.

263
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,400
Of course,I'll provide ample manpower...

264
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,770
...and equipments.

265
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,280
How could you trust him?

266
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,520
Yes,this matter is suspicious.

267
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,200
You're suppose to capture a murderer but you're cheated?

268
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,760
Was I?

269
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,760
I feel that Nakagawa Ryosuke isn't as nice as we think.

270
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,400
He might be using you.

271
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,130
We don't even know his motives.

272
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:04,320
Things will return to normal if we get to the bottom of this.

273
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,680
Besides,Nakagawa Ryosuke knows about the Golden Eyes.

274
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,480
To stop the side effects of the Golden Eyes,...

275
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,370
...we need to work with him.

276
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,400
We'll go with you.

277
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,170
Is there news on Lu Mang?

278
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,520
Yelena's men is searching the city.

279
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,040
Mr. Nakagawa,how was the talk?

280
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,640
I'm sending Zhuang Rui to the desert in Gansu.

281
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,080
He'll find out about the secret of the Golden Eyes.

282
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,800
The Nakagawa family's success was due to the Golden Eyes.

283
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,570
I'm willing to pay any price...

284
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,220
...to make the Nakagawa family be the best in the world.

285
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,620
Mr. Nakagawa,you will certainly get what you want.

286
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:06,160
We have news of Lu Mang.

287
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,040
Where is he? I'll be right there.

288
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,560
Are you all right?

289
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,880
Xiaorui,be honest with me.

290
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,400
I'm worried about your health.

291
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,320
I'm really fine. Don't worry.

292
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,670
If I feel uncomfortable, I'll tell you.

293
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,920
It's just that Lu Mang is not easy to handle.

294
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,400
I wonder how Feifei is doing.

295
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,160
We should have gone with her.

296
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,400
Relax,she's professional.

297
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,000
Police serves the public. I'll custom-order a silk banner...

298
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,480
...when we return to China. What do you think?

299
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,140
I'm asking you, what do you think?

300
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,300
I'm talking about Feifei.

301
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,340
She's getting better.

302
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,250
You're good.

303
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,040
I think you're good,too.

304
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,650
Have you seen these two people?

305
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,400
I can't disclose personal information of our guests.

306
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,960
You can't take it!

307
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,120
Is it this one?

308
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:29,800
Let's go.

309
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,380
Feifei.

310
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,690
He just left.

311
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,400
Can we go now? -You're done here.

312
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:03,920
All right.

313
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,320
Yelena,call the police.

314
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,000
Let's talk before the police gets here.

315
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,280
I'll be direct. Tell me.

316
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,860
Who ordered you to steal the Tamamoku stone?

317
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,280
You're not going to talk?

318
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,720
Fine,but one word of advice.

319
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,540
If you cooperate,you'll have...

320
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,800
...a lighter sentence as an informant.

321
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,400
I don't need that.

322
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,200
Then,we'll talk again after I capture Qin Xuanbing.

323
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,840
Miss Qin didn't do anything.

324
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,730
Didn't do anything?

325
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,960
She ordered you to do bad things. That's a fact.

326
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,720
Like father,like daughter.

327
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,380
She's indeed Qin Haoran's daughter.

328
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,200
She's adopted.
