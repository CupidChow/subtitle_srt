1
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,000
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Episode 13

3
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,800
Happiness comes with contentment.

4
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,000
I understand.

5
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,320
It looks like you'd plan to compete with me at the auction.

6
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,520
Pardon me,then.

7
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,120
Are you Pengfei? Have a seat.

8
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,520
You trained for a few years and had missions at the borders.

9
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,680
With your skills,you should be one of the best in the team.

10
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,820
I see it now.

11
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,610
I gave you so much money.

12
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,850
You can't even settle a tiny sheep.

13
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,000
It's my mistake. I'll return the money to you.

14
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,120
Do you think that I'm a loan shark?

15
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,610
You've taken this lightly.

16
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,400
You're aware Xu family's position in the capital.

17
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,920
I'm telling you.

18
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,480
Do you think your teammate's family can enter the hospital?9

19
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,440
Don't be anxious. Relax.

20
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,180
I don't care what happened. I have another mission for you.

21
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,160
If you can make it,I'll give you another RMB300,000.

22
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,500
However,if you can't do it properly,...

23
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,980
...I'll deal with both of your mistakes at once.

24
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,400
Yes. That's it.

25
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,600
Director Xu didn't say much.

26
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,880
By the way,I'm on my way back to the hotel.

27
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,339
Are you and Brother Ma coming?

28
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,400
Give the thing back to me. -What is it?

29
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,880
The notebook.

30
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,570
Is this really the notebook he was trying to grab?

31
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,680
Hello,Director Xu. -Hello.

32
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,800
Have you gotten the thing? -Not yet.

33
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,720
Are you playing with me? Pengfei,let me tell you.

34
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,660
If you want to stay in Ping Zhou, get that thing for me quick.

35
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,760
Don't worry. I will do as I've promised.

36
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,400
Xiao Rui,you're good.

37
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,000
You do things fast. -What did I do?

38
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,000
What did I do?

39
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:44,020
Are you still pretending?

40
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,600
Am I pretending? What am I pretending?

41
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,480
Why does my whole body ache?

42
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,880
You used too much force.

43
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,570
Yes,there were some body contact,but...

44
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,320
...I didn't use too much force.

45
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,240
I don't know about that. You should ask Feifei.

46
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,050
Did Feifei send me back?

47
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,960
When I came in yesterday, I saw the two of you...

48
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,640
...on the floor.

49
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,760
Can you spit that out and talk properly?

50
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,740
What did you say about yesterday?

51
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,210
I saw the two of you on the floor last night.

52
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,680
What happened then? We laid on the floor. What happened after?

53
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,280
I don't know what happened after that.

54
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,720
There's four of us today.

55
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,880
It's a double date.

56
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,980
Can you say something else? -I can say a lot more.

57
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,560
Feifei,thank you for saving me last night.

58
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,200
I didn't. I just happened to pass by.

59
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,280
By the way,I have to ask you.

60
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,480
Why does my body ache when I wake up?

61
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,520
You were beaten up.

62
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,360
Did Zhuang Rui got beaten up?

63
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,020
What are you doing?

64
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,600
So that was what this was. Feifei.

65
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,600
You're pretending well.

66
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,700
What did Feifei do?

67
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,080
You were beaten up but you're thinking about something else.

68
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,360
Think about yourself.

69
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,780
I know that person. I think that he...

70
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,920
...wouldn't hurt me.

71
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,880
I think you deserve the beatings. Do you know who he is?

72
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,800
I'm not sure,but I know that he's sent by Xu family.

73
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,960
You don't even know the person and you made judgements.

74
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,240
Let me tell you. If he hadn't gotten lucky,...

75
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,440
...a soldier from the special forces can make you suffer.

76
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,500
What? Did you say a soldier from the special forces?

77
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,640
I've checked on him. He's called Pengfei.

78
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,960
He retired a year ago. When he was on mission at the borders,...

79
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,760
...his two teammates was injured and passed away.

80
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,120
Although they received a small amount of compensation,...

81
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,360
...one of their mothers had cancer.

82
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,530
One of the teammates...

83
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:11,360
...has a wife and children.

84
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,400
After he retired from the military,he started working...

85
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,400
...to earn money for them, but the money is too little...

86
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,250
...for these two families.

87
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,130
He's a rather kind person. Why did he beat someone up?

88
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,170
It must be for the money.

89
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,240
Look at you. Do you know him well? You're making judgements already.

90
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,840
Do you think everyone is a money miser like you?

91
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,120
I agree with what he said.

92
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,120
I believe that Xu Wei gave him a huge sum of money...

93
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,440
...to get rid of a problem.

94
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,840
Did you say a problem?

95
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,960
Are you talking about me? -Of course.

96
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,280
Pengfei didn't want to hurt you. I felt it yesterday.

97
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,280
He didn't go all out, or else even if it wasn't you.....

98
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,560
I don't understand. Why is Xu Wei aiming for you?

99
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,780
Did you offend him?

100
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,980
The day before yesterday,...

101
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,320
...I exposed Xu family's tricks.

102
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,880
Yesterday,I ruined one of his plans too.

103
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,520
I also rejected...

104
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,730
...the collaboration with Xu Wei.

105
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,200
It sounds like you're going against the Xu family instead.

106
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,240
Why is that?

107
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,160
I suspect that they're sabotaging the jade market...

108
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,400
...by colluding secretly with others to get personal benefits.

109
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,940
Hello. -Hello,Officer Ding.

110
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,760
The situation now is like this.

111
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,520
Xu family may be controlling the public auctions in Ping Zhou.

112
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,920
It involves bribery and commercial fraud.

113
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,900
Is there evidence?

114
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,960
There's a breakthrough. We'll find evidence if we continue.

115
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,920
What do you think?

116
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,600
Combine the murder case of Mr. Yu with Xu Corporation's crime.

117
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,800
Capture Xu Wei through the commercial crime.

118
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,360
We can then investigate him thoroughly.

119
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,840
Aren't you in Ping Zhou with him?

120
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,760
Officer Ding,the public auction in Ping Zhou is ending soon.

121
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,040
We must not lose this chance.

122
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,880
Alright. I'll report it to the higher officials. Wait for it.

123
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,360
Noted!

124
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,130
Did anything happen to both of you last night?

125
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,920
Nothing happened. -I got excited for no reason.

126
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,440
Feifei came to Ping Zhou this time to handle a case.

127
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,770
I feel that she's not in a good mood lately.

128
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,890
You care about her a lot.

129
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,800
What do you mean? She's here to handle a case.

130
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,380
You came here to help her? -That's right.

131
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,000
How are you helping her? -I think she's following Xu Wei.

132
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,540
She asked me so many questions about him.

133
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,540
If I knew that this brat is bad, I'd have asked Feifei to get him.

134
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,520
We need evidence. -What evidence do we need?

135
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,600
Hack into his computer and his phone.

136
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,800
You'd get your evidence. -You watch too many movies.

137
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,640
We're not special agents. Special agents?

138
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,000
There's someone who can be a special agent.

139
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,080
Xiao Zhuang. Zhuang'er.

140
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,360
You two are late. Come,look at this.

141
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,440
Don't look back. Just act natural.

142
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,600
What's wrong? -We have someone...

143
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,720
...following us. -How do we get rid of them?

144
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,480
There's no need for that.

145
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,520
I was talking about this piece. Xiao Zhuang,take a look.

146
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:26,880
Take a look at this. -Brother Ma,this...

147
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,800
...is quite exquisite. -We must pretend professionally.

148
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,220
Boss,if you're interested, why not take a look at this?

149
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,560
Xiao Zhuang,have a look at that. -Sure.

150
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,040
I'll shine on it for you.

151
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,080
The pattern of this pine tree flowers.....

152
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,880
This would do.

153
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,880
I won't pursue on the things you did before.

154
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,570
Let us do it this way.

155
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,720
What about the money?

156
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,960
Do you still dare to ask me for money?

157
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,120
You and Zhuang Rui lied to me. Do you think I'm an idiot?

158
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,940
I don't want chaos in the public auction or I'd have killed you.

159
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,360
I'm annoyed just looking at you. Scram now.

160
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,040
Young lad,don't be so impulsive,...

161
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,160
...or else you won't be the only one laying...

162
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,360
...in the hospital.

163
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,920
Tell me. You've put in effort to look for me. What do you want?

164
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:19,240
You attacked me twice. You shouldn't be saying that.

165
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,680
You didn't fulfil your promise. If you hadn't come to the auction,...

166
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,120
...there won't be so many things happening.

167
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,240
We are clear about your situation.

168
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,960
I'll pay for the medical bills of your teammates' families.

169
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,920
This isn't a small amount of money. Why would you help me?

170
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,530
It's because...

171
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,690
...I respect you for your loyalty.

172
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,080
Of course,we have some requests.

173
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,970
There's something that we would like to ask you for help.

174
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,690
What is it? -Help us collect evidence.

175
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,960
Help us collect evidence about Xu Corporation's commercial crime.

176
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,400
We have a plan,but it needs...

177
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,680
...someone who can fight well like you.

178
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,240
Why are you still hesitating? Xu Wei can pay you to do things...

179
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,440
...but we can't. -Don't say that.

180
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,200
If it won't work,...

181
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,980
...we can think of other ways.

182
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,690
Let's go.

183
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,650
What do you need me to do?

184
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,740
What's wrong with you?

185
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,210
My eyes don't feel well.

186
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,290
My eyes don't feel well. -The eye drop is in my pocket.

187
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,640
Thank you.

188
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,040
No. If you really don't feel well,..

189
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,040
...I can go to the hospital with you.

190
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,200
It's not the time to fall sick. We're separating tomorrow.

191
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,160
I'm going to protect the world. You're going to earn some money.

192
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,640
Who is it? -Zhuang Rui.

193
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,200
I'll go.

194
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,800
Xu Zhendong asked you out. I'm a bit worried...

195
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,580
...so I came to see you.

196
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,320
It's nothing. We're just chatting. -Did he ask you to join him?

197
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,320
People with different opinions can't work together.

198
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,040
I knew it. However,...

199
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,840
...even if Xu Zhendong doesn't ask you to join him,...

200
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,360
...they can still control the public auction easily...

201
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,820
...and take away what they want. -It's fine.

202
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,520
Don't worry. We still have chance.

203
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,000
Do you have a better plan? -Of course.

204
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,760
Sometimes,the popular things are not necessarily good.

205
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,560
If we change our way of thinking, there can be a better chance.

206
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,970
A chance that is greater than none?

207
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,240
Perhaps,I can consider it.

208
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,940
What's wrong with you?

209
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,760
I'm fine. -Are you really fine?

210
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,520
You don't look good. Do you want me to send you to the hospital?

211
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,400
I'm fine. I'm just exhausted. I hadn't rested well.

212
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,800
That's why I'm like this. I'm fine.

213
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,760
Sorry,it's my fault. I shouldn't tell you all this.

214
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,330
I've made you worry.

215
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,200
If we can't fight Xu family, then we won't fight.

216
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,920
Don't worry. -I promised you,I'll try my best.

217
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,450
Zhuang Rui,you don't have to force yourself.

218
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,440
I'm not forcing myself. Did you know?

219
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,320
This is my first time knowing...

220
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,970
...that others need me too.

221
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,920
This is also my first time...

222
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,000
...knowing that I can actually help people.

223
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,980
Since the first time I met you,I knew that...

224
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,760
...you have a harmonious and generous personality.

225
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:15,520
Everything seems perfect from your perspective.

226
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,800
You're just like a child.

227
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,770
You've done well. You fought Xu family with the small...

228
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,680
...investors the first time you're involved in stones gambling.

229
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,760
You fought for justice of the crowd. Did you know that?

230
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:33,000
You're a hero. -I.....

231
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,480
Don't argue. It's true.

232
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,530
It's getting late. Hurry up and go home for some rest.

233
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,320
The higher officials have approved your investigation.

234
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,600
That's great! -Don't be happy too soon.

235
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:02,520
Communicate with the police in Ping Zhou and collect evidence.

236
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,720
Team 2 has also started...

237
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,240
...checking on the carpenters that make weapons such as crossbows.

238
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,370
When would we know then, Officer Ding?

239
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,530
I'm think that we would know very soon.

240
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,490
I'll treat you to a good meal when I return.

241
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,400
Did you mention a good meal? You must keep your promise.

242
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,520
Don't worry.

243
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,580
The case is the most critical. What meal are you talking about?

244
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,360
2018 Ping Zhou Jade Workshop Sealed-bid Auction

245
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,000
It's bright and spacious. The participants must be capable.

246
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,840
Isn't it?

247
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,650
There's no one here.

248
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,840
There's no need to look. -It's right here.

249
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,570
It's here. -You can have a seat.

250
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,520
Bidders,attention please.

251
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,330
If you win the bid,... -President Gu,please have a seat.

252
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,140
...please head towards the windows to sign the bidding contract.

253
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,330
Mr. Xu,the bid is starting. All the bidding has been closed.

254
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,380
Have you completed your task? -Don't worry,Mr. Xu.

255
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,040
Zhuang Rui,...

256
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,320
...we shall see.

257
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,010
Let's go.

258
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,800
The sealed-bid is starting soon. All bidders,please take note.

259
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,480
If you win the bid,please bring your personal documents and...

260
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,080
...proceed to sign the contract -Miss Xiao Jia's voice is nice.

261
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,400
Mr. Xu.

262
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,400
Mr. Xu.

263
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,840
Why is it you again? -Mr. Xu.

264
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,090
I've done as you asked. Can you please give me more money?

265
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,840
Are you an idiot or deaf?

266
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,200
I'll tell you again. I won't even give you a cent.

267
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,800
Don't let me see you again or you'll be dead.

268
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,680
Uncle and Grandpa Gu.

269
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,040
No. 092 has won Bid 398.

270
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,400
The bidding price is RMB780,000. -It's me!

271
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,880
I got it! It's me! This piece is mine!

272
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,040
I'm the first one! Don't fight with me!

273
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,170
Congratulations. -Thank you so much!

274
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,840
I'm taking it! Don't snatch it from me! Okay! Bye!

275
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,400
Unbelievable. This brat didn't set a password for his phone.

276
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,080
No. 062 has won Bid 112.

277
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,600
The bidding price is RMB4,000,000.

278
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,080
Brother Ma,why don't you let me hold your number plate for you?

279
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,080
Your hand keeps sweating. You're going to wash off the plate.

280
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,640
It's fine. Why..... Why aren't we getting it?

281
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,080
Don't be anxious. It just started. -No. 062 has...

282
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,680
...won Bid 359. The bidding price is...

283
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,520
...RMB5,825,000.

284
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:59,240
I must find out who's No. 62.

285
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,340
He's snatching mine every round.

286
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,800
How is it going? -I need more time.

287
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,800
No. 062 has gotten Bid 193.

288
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,600
The bidding price is RMB6,000,000.

289
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,040
The average bidding price this year has increased quite a lot.

290
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,480
The value of jades are getting better.

291
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,320
However,quality ones are hard to find.

292
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,600
President Gu,we should get together to discuss this some day.

293
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,730
Mr. Xu is too polite.

294
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,840
I see that you're lucky today. You look confident in winning.

295
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,890
Don't lie to me. You must have gotten some good stuff.

296
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,560
Is it that easy to get good stuff?

297
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,240
The demand is more than the supply. Being rich has no use.

298
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,520
You must have good eyes, be smart and charismatic.

299
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,480
Gamble on stones is easy but it's hard to know others' thoughts.

300
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,120
You said it well.

301
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,220
It's possible to get a black heart...

302
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,040
...when you cut open the cobra skin with pine tree pattern.

303
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,480
It may look normal on the outside,...

304
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,120
...but it may be emerald glass within.

305
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,760
President Gu is teaching me a lot.

306
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,120
Don't say that, you're flattering me.

307
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,600
No. 053 has won Bid 59.

308
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,400
The bidding price is RMB25,500,000.

309
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,880
Is it 053? Did I listen wrongly?

310
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,600
Yes. Is it 053?

311
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,400
Congratulations. -Congratulations.

312
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,760
This wasn't easy.

313
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,680
No. 053 has won Bid 352.

314
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,160
The bidding price is RMB998,000.

315
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,960
Check the list. What's going on?

316
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,480
The list is in your phone.

317
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,840
Where is my phone? -I don't know.

318
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,120
Did you leave it in the resting room?

319
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,240
Please excuse me.

320
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,400
No. 053 has won Bid 036.

321
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,320
The bidding price is RMB5,200,000.

322
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:20,960
This is good. -That's incredible.

323
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,130
Dear ancestors, please hurry this up.

324
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,850
Please hurry up.

325
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,920
Xu Wei,did you steal my notebook?

326
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,710
Where did this dog come from? -Hold it there.

327
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,639
How long do you need? -It's almost done.

328
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,199
How are we going to get out later?

329
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,830
Are we going to be stuck here?

330
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:39,280
112,359,193.

331
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,440
I've recorded all these stones in my notebook.

332
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,840
You're selling these stones with more than RMB5,000.

333
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,210
Tell me that you didn't do this and this is all a coincidence.

334
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,860
I've told you before. Don't mess with me if you can't afford to.

335
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,440
You're merely a player.

336
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,440
However,I'm the one who sets the rules of the game.

337
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,040
Are you angry?

338
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,140
Are you not satisfied?

339
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,450
You haven't told me that...

340
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,370
...whether you stole my notebook.

341
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,760
Don't talk about your notebook.

342
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,640
You're not worth even a cent to me.

343
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,480
No. 053 has won Bid 077.

344
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
The bidding price is RMB798,000.

345
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,080
Why are you so careless? -That scared me.

346
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,130
I've settled it. -Let's go.

347
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,080
Didn't you tell me that there'd be no mistakes?

348
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,480
Why is Ma Pangzi getting this piece of jade?

349
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,480
The bidding numbers of these five pieces aren't in the notebook.

350
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,720
Are you telling me that he did it behind Zhuang Rui's back?

351
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,720
That is possible.

352
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,360
That person called Zhuang can't be getting every stone right.

353
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,960
Ma Pangzi may have back-ups.

354
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,320
It's impossible. They must be setting a trap.

355
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,880
How are things going with Director Zhang?

356
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,640
Director Zhang said that the bidders' info is confidential.

357
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,320
He's only a director in charge of administration of the association.

358
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,850
There might be no other way.

359
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,200
What's the situation with No. 0?

360
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,440
Don't worry. We're always the one with the highest price.

361
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,530
This is good! I got it again! Few times in a row!

362
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,560
Congratulations. -Congratulations.

363
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,620
Congratulations.

364
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,500
I got it a few times in a row. -Is that true?

365
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,050
I don't remember bidding on these few pieces of jade.

366
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,400
Xu Wei sent men to steal my notebook.

367
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,560
He wanted to prevent us from buying this stone,...

368
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,840
...so I went along with his plan and bought all the real stones...

369
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,280
...with No. 053 on your behalf.

370
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,250
I recorded all the fake stones in my notebook.

371
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,320
A tiny sheep has become an old fox. You even kept me in the dark.

372
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,360
No. 053 has won Bid 168.

373
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,320
You won it again? -I won it again!

374
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,560
Thank you.

375
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:24,960
Well done.

376
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,080
You advanced secretly without people knowing. I'm impressed.

377
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,040
You must explain this in front of everyone.

378
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,600
You must explain it in front of Xu family to resolve my hatred.

379
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,280
They're watching me too closely.

380
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,740
If I don't use this method, I can't fool them.

381
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,960
I've sent it to the police anonymously.

382
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,680
It's a good thing but you're being anonymous.

383
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,200
It's a small matter.

384
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,400
Officer Miao,don't worry. We'll cooperate with you.

385
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,600
Thank you,Leader Liu. The police in Ping Zhou work efficiently.

386
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,880
Leader Liu,we just received an anonymous mail.

387
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,080
The information in the mail is related to Xu Corporation.

388
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:18,930
Brother San.

389
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,400
Why did you not come in but asked me out instead?

390
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,940
I bet it was you who sent me the parcel.

391
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,200
What parcel?

392
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,200
I'm busy marking the stones.

393
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,640
Alright. I wanted to thank you personally.

394
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,240
But,if it's not you,then, I'll go thank the kind citizen...

395
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,240
...who helped the police as an anonymous.

396
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,560
You're kind. There will be many who help you.

397
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,680
I'll get back to marking stones.
