1
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,000
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 24

3
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm not the King of Gambling.

4
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,479
I'm just a common man.

5
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,479
I am afraid of death,too.

6
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,560
Having known you as my friends...

7
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,690
...is enough for me.

8
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,800
Let me remember your faces. -Five!

9
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,330
I will not forget all of you.

10
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,360
We'll meet in the next life. -Four!

11
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:30,880
Three!

12
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,920
Zhuang Rui! -Xiaorui!

13
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,840
Two! -Zhuang Rui!

14
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,920
Zhuang Rui!

15
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,680
You're all right. I'm glad.

16
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,720
Four of you are indeed lucky.

17
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,560
However,you might be as lucky...

18
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,200
...after this.

19
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,600
Freeze!

20
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,500
It's your turn.

21
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,480
Zhuang Rui. -Xiaorui.

22
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,360
Okay,I'll be there.

23
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,120
Miss.

24
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,320
Miss,Mr. Qin sent me to bring you back.

25
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,440
I still have things to do.

26
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,200
Miss,the car is waiting downstairs.

27
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,330
I will send you back now.

28
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,920
You can wait in the car, I'll be there soon.

29
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,120
I'll wait for you right here.

30
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,120
You're up. How are you feeling now?

31
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,440
Where's Feifei? Is everybody all right?

32
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,400
Don't worry,they're fine.

33
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,690
I wanted to buy mangosteens for you...

34
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,400
...but I couldn't find them so I got you an apple.

35
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,160
You can have that for now.

36
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,560
I thought we would have a good time in Myanmar.

37
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,320
I'm sorry for causing you injury again.

38
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,400
However,I have made the arrangements.

39
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,400
You can stay here for a few more days.

40
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,120
You can think about things when you feel better.

41
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,600
It's all right,Xuanbing. I'm grateful for your help.

42
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,260
If it weren't for you, things would've gone bad.

43
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,080
I want to thank you.

44
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,159
If you mean it, then you must rest well.

45
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,610
Take good care of yourself and stay away from danger.

46
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,960
Thank you,Xuanbing. You're a good person.

47
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,760
Eat up.

48
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,080
Xiaorui,you're up!

49
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,130
I'll take my leave now. I'll come visit you again.

50
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:05,840
Okay.

51
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,240
Feifei? -She's in a critical condition.

52
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
She's still unconscious. She may seem like a fighter...

53
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,520
...but she's quite fragile. Who knows when she'll recover?

54
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,760
Why don't you bring me to her?

55
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,960
No,hold on.

56
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,960
You must promise me something. -I have no time for this.

57
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,600
No,you must promise me first then I'll take you to her.

58
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,880
Take me to Feifei and I'll consider that.

59
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,940
Xiaorui,you've changed. You used to prioritise friendship.

60
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,120
Do you want me to promise you? -Yes...

61
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,920
...so promise me first. -If you bring me to her,...

62
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,680
...I promise you, after I see her,...

63
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,960
...I'll promise to consider whether I should promise you.

64
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,680
If you promise me,...

65
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,210
...I'll take you to Feifei. -Sure,what is it?

66
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,120
It's about what's underneath my bed in Siheyuan.

67
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,360
You must keep a secret about my treasures.

68
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,289
You mustn't let Miss Xiaojia know.

69
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,360
That wasn't what you said. I heard you that day.

70
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,040
Couldn't you tell I was desperate?

71
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,960
I thought I was going to die but God had mercy on me.

72
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,800
All right,let's go. -Do you promise me that?

73
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,220
Please.

74
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,960
Feifei.

75
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,040
Why did you push me out? -Couldn't you see?

76
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,880
Are your brains in your muscles?

77
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,640
The two lovebirds need time alone.

78
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,120
Why would we disturb them? -I don't see it happening.

79
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,040
You are indeed a simpleton.

80
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,440
This near-death incident will only bring them closer.

81
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,520
I like Feifei better than...

82
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,200
...Miss Qin. -Does Miss Qin also like.....

83
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,160
I'm aware that Miss Qin...

84
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,960
...has a beautiful face and a great figure.

85
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,620
However,it's not easy to be with the rich like them.

86
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,840
We are rich,too,but we're on a whole different level.

87
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,920
We're not the same. Feifei however,is different.

88
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,800
I know that she isn't the most feminine...

89
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,720
...but underneath the tough facade lays a kind soul.

90
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,300
She is a perfect match for Zhuang Rui.

91
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,100
You should be a relationship expert.

92
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
Who's over there?

93
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,080
What is he doing?

94
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,120
He's not saying anything. I feel uneasy.

95
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,200
Zhuang Rui!

96
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,050
I thought I'd never see you again. Zhuang Rui!

97
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,280
Don't worry,you'll be fine.

98
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,560
I will bring you back to Beijing,to Siheyuan,...

99
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,640
...to Ruiyunzhai.

100
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,960
Where are we going?

101
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,000
You must stay here and don't come out no matter what.

102
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,400
You must leave now! They will get here soon.

103
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,930
All of you...

104
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,930
...must return safely.

105
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,290
That's enough talking.

106
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,940
What are you doing?

107
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,120
You're awake.

108
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,640
Here. -Are you all right?

109
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,600
I'm fine. What about you? How's your forehead?

110
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,650
Does it hurt?

111
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,520
I'm strong. Of course I'm fine.

112
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,400
Thank you for doing what you say would do.

113
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,360
What did I do? I didn't do anything.

114
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,800
It's strange. I remember...

115
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,080
...that someone kept saying things next to me...

116
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,010
...and it went on for long. -Were you eavesdropping?

117
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,480
Miss Miao Feifei.

118
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,640
I haven't even said who it was, why are you getting exited?

119
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,420
Zhuang Rui,let me tell you,..

120
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,920
...if I had handcuffs on me, I would use it on you right now.

121
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,080
Officer Miao,please don't. I was only joking.

122
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,680
I had no idea that you were this cunning.

123
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,520
I had no idea that you are weak,too.

124
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,840
Who's weak?

125
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,960
Here's an extra meal service.

126
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,920
Here's a grade A apple that's not rotten.

127
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,300
Does it taste good?

128
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,000
Finish it then.

129
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,640
When Wenwen's father left us, I thought my life was over.

130
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,440
If it wasn't for Wenwen, I couldn't have made it.

131
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,080
The wealth that I've accumulated all these years...

132
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,600
...is a reward from God.

133
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,160
It's also for how I treat others and for raising my daughter.

134
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,400
However,Zhuang Rui taught me a lesson this time.

135
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,160
One can be kind to everyone in the world.

136
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:43,480
I'm ashamed for the things that I have done...

137
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,940
...but I hope that you can forgive me.

138
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,760
As a mother, that was selfish of me.

139
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,120
Aunt Hu,don't say that. As a mother,...

140
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,800
...you were not at fault but you did well.

141
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,680
Let us this behind us. A toast to you.

142
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,240
Thank you.

143
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,440
Zhuang Rui, I mean what I said earlier.

144
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,349
When we have mined the stones,...

145
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,760
...your share of profit will still be 25%.

146
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,589
Aunt Hu,that was music to my ears. Here,...

147
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,200
...cheers to becoming richer and for good friends.

148
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,829
Cheers. -Cheers.

149
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,060
Why didn't you tell me that you were injured?

150
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,410
I'm glad that you're fine or else I will blame myself.

151
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,800
It's nothing.

152
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,000
Actually,you were very brave.

153
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,880
If you hadn't returned to get help...

154
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,760
...and saved us, I wouldn't be sitting here.

155
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,880
So I have to thank you.

156
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,520
Thank you.

157
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,400
I have no words to thank all of you.

158
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,840
I should thank you for this new experience.

159
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,340
Feifei.

160
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,920
Thank you for your help. -Don't mention it.

161
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,000
To be honest,the incident this time was thrilling.

162
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,210
I almost died at a young age.

163
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,680
I wonder who almost peed in his pants.

164
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,160
He even left a will. What was it?

165
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,760
Miss Xiaojia! My secret stash!

166
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,240
Please don't tell Miss Xiaojia about my secret stash.

167
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,290
I saved your life after all.

168
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,480
We'll see how you behave.

169
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,680
Thank you.

170
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,400
It has been hard on everyone.

171
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,400
Stay here for a few days. Feel free to ask for anything.

172
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:23,000
Remember,Myanmar is your home. Come back home often.

173
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,560
Yes,that wouldn't be a problem.

174
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:32,040
There will be dividends at the end of the year.

175
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,320
We must come home often, come home often.

176
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,120
Here,cheers to this. -Cheers.

177
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,080
Cheers.

178
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,330
How is Zhuang Rui doing?

179
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,820
He's all right now.

180
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,160
I'm sorry.

181
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,120
I acted without your permission and made you worry.

182
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,400
Father,if we hadn't gotten there in time,...

183
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,660
...Bo Gang would've killed Zhuang Rui and the rest.

184
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,970
Didn't Hu Rong's men arrived in time,too?

185
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,200
I told you.

186
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,530
There is no need for us to get involved.

187
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,680
I was just worried.

188
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,480
If Zhuang Rui is hurt, our plan will be ruined.

189
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,250
If you keep losing your composure,...

190
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,410
...it will ruin our plans,too. Have you thought about that?

191
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,040
Yes,father.

192
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,760
I will not do it again.

193
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,000
Xuanbing,...

194
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,080
...this is very important. Keep it well.

195
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,400
Remember, don't disappoint me again.

196
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,720
I understand.

197
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,900
How is Miss Miao doing?

198
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,640
A strong woman like her is doing much better now.

199
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,160
I'm glad to hear that. I'm sure you went through a lot.

200
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,320
I hurt my head and was in a daze.

201
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,120
I was lucky that Feifei was there to take care of me.

202
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,880
If she wasn't there,...

203
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,370
...I would've been captured already.

204
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,280
Miss Miao carried out her duties as your bodyguard.

205
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,120
You should thank her.

206
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,200
There is a night market around here.

207
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,240
I was finding time to bring you there.

208
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,880
You had a long hospital stay. I'm sure you want to relax.

209
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,800
How did you find out...

210
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,820
...that I was captured by Bo Gang?

211
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,260
I found out that Hu Rong's daughter was captured...

212
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:33,080
...and you saved her but was captured instead.

213
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,960
I'm glad the men that I sent got there in time.

214
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,240
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

215
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,570
Zhuang Rui, you have always gotten lucky.

216
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,960
The harder I work, the luckier I become.

217
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,880
I'll properly thank you and Mr. Qin.

218
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,780
Let go of me.

219
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,680
What is it? I'm leaving. -Don't go.

220
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,360
Miss Qin is on a date with Zhuang Rui. That's what it is.

221
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,160
What does that have to do with me?

222
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,480
Look at you,still in denial. I don't understand you.

223
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,840
Take a look in the mirror. You look gloomy.

224
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,220
You're the gloomy one.

225
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,640
Look at them having a good time.

226
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,400
What are they saying? -How can I hear from here?

227
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,080
You should eavesdrop. -They'll find out.

228
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,520
Go!

229
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,440
Didn't you say it has nothing to do with you?

230
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,180
This place looks small...

231
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,800
...but it is full of Burmese street food.

232
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,780
Besides,you'll find many interesting items here.

233
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Yes,this place looks happening.

234
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,000
Boss,how much is this?

235
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,930
I can give it to you for K 40,000.

236
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,600
K 40,000?

237
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,210
You found something you like already.

238
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,320
This item doesn't seem unique.

239
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,540
Other stalls are selling it,too.

240
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,360
It's not unique but I've analysed it.

241
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:51,160
This should be carved from a 100-year-old lychee tree.

242
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,020
Its colours and workmanship are excellent.

243
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,480
I'm buying this as a souvenir.

244
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,760
I can't stand the noise here. -It's not about the place.

245
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,960
Look around. You can see couples being in love...

246
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,320
...and holding hands. -That's enough.

247
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,640
Let's go back.

248
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,880
You do seem interested in shopping.

249
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,400
I didn't come here willingly.

250
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,680
You forced me here. Which one looks better?

251
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,000
Listen here,don't you understand what I'm doing?

252
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,040
Be honest to yourself.

253
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,000
Aren't you curious what Zhuang Rui and Miss Qin are doing?

254
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,320
What is there to be curious? Zhuang Rui is injured...

255
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,880
...so he needs to stay safe. I'm his bodyguard...

256
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,120
...so I must stay close. -Is that all?

257
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,120
Well,you can see that Zhuang Rui is recovering well.

258
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,450
He can even jump around so let's head back.

259
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,600
Huang Fuyun!

260
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,280
It's getting late. Why don't you return for a rest?

261
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,320
What are your plans after this?

262
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,200
Do you need me to arrange a flight back to China?

263
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,640
It's all right. I have Boss Hu here.

264
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,730
We will return together when this is all over.

265
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,920
Zhuang Rui, I asked you out today...

266
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,360
...to bid you farewell. -Bid me farewell?

267
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,540
Are you returning to Beijing?

268
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,500
I'm returning to Kiev.

269
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,360
I don't know when we will meet again.

270
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,120
With the technology nowadays, we can keep in touch.

271
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,360
You! Can you please be gentle?

272
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,200
Calm down. We don't want them to find out.

273
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,120
Let go of me.

274
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,580
It's a good thing I came prepared.

275
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,760
Be gentle. -I will.

276
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,740
There are too many people.

277
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,760
Can you do it? Just give it to me.

278
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,720
I keep this cricket with me always.

279
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,000
I'm reminded of you whenever I see it.

280
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,980
Zhuang Rui,...

281
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,240
...I sometimes wish that we can stay like this...

282
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,680
...forever.

283
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,850
Why does it sound like we'll never meet again?

284
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,240
I wish you a safe trip.

285
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,400
Take care. -You take care,too.

286
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,320
Let's take a look over there.

287
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,840
They left.

288
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:58,680
You!

289
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,480
Did you buy a wood carving?

290
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,000
Zhuang Rui,I was thinking about the mining vein.

291
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,280
You're aware that this mine is my life.

292
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,600
You showed me the purple jade sample earlier.

293
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,640
I'd like to understand what actually happened...

294
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,720
...but looking at the situation now,...

295
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,770
...with no experts on site, I'd like to ask you...

296
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:56,040
...to enter the hill again and explore the mining vein.

297
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,480
Aunt Hu,I understand your predicament.

298
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,280
However,I have never been exposed to mining veins.

299
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,400
This is my first time learning about it.

300
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,680
I'm afraid that it'll be difficult.

301
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,800
I'm sure you know that after this incident,...

302
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,000
...it'll be hard to sell off this mine.

303
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,500
I trust your discerning ability.

304
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,140
Actually,studying mines...

305
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,520
...and studying stones are similar. You can do this.

306
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,840
Did you know that mining veins do not belong to anyone?

307
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,240
It's finders keepers...

308
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,400
...so we have to hurry to prevent more incidents like this.

309
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,080
I'm afraid that the mining vein...

310
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,540
...is not attainable.

311
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,680
Why is that?

312
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,020
Do you remember...

313
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,700
...the village that I was trapped in?

314
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,700
According to my observation,...

315
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,520
...the walls of the mining vein surround the village.

316
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,670
When I entered the hill to explore the mining vein,...

317
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:12,080
...I noticed that the entire hill...

318
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,840
...is severely unstable. I'm sure you know...

319
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,080
...that not only will there be usage of heavy machinery...

320
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,920
...but explosives might be used, too. Once you do this,...

321
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,040
...the entire hill will collapse.

322
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,880
The entire village will be buried underneath.

323
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:38,360
However,you did say that it was merely speculations.

324
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,600
As long as we be careful, it will be fine.

325
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,920
However,if the worse were to happen,...

326
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,449
...not only will you destroy the village,...

327
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,940
...many lives would be gone,too.

328
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:57,800
Zhuang Rui,you must be able to adapt to any situations.

329
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,840
We can just ask the villagers to relocate.

330
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,480
When the mining is successful, compensation is not a problem.

331
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,520
Forget a village, we can even build a city.

332
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,400
Don't worry about this. My men will handle it.

333
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,780
Zhuang Rui,...

334
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,520
...you are too kind...

335
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,600
...and smart,too. That's what I admire about you.

336
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,320
However,being too kind...

337
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,880
...puts you at a disadvantage.

338
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,810
I don't mind that...

339
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,970
...as long as I don't cheat others.

340
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,840
I don't mind living a simple life.

341
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,880
What are all these money doing on the table?

342
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:18,760
Village head,of course we have a reason for this.

343
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,080
We came here to talk to you about the village relocation.

344
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,320
These money are compensation.

345
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,970
If it's not enough, we can add more.

346
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,210
We only ask everyone to relocate as soon as possible.

347
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,920
If you need any assistance, please reach out to us.

348
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,560
If there's no problem, please sign this agreement.

349
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,520
The money will then be yours.

350
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,340
Are you asking us to relocate?

351
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,600
There are not many of us here...

352
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,160
...but we have been here for generations.

353
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,680
I can relocate the living but what about the dead?

354
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,570
We can assist you in relocating your cemeteries.

355
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,970
You don't have to worry.

356
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,200
These are just the deposit. The rest of the payment...

357
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,520
...will be handled by our legal team.

358
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,200
When there's money on the table, of course we'll do anything.

359
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,050
However,relocating an entire village will be impossible.

360
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:35,320
With all this money, you will have better lives.

361
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,960
It's not about the money.

362
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,280
What about the cemetery? What about our houses?

363
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:47,680
How do we relocate the spirits of our ancestors?

364
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,300
Do you remember Zhuang Rui and Miss Miao?

365
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,560
You captured them to be your slaves.

366
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,640
You also captured outsiders for the same purpose.

367
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,040
I heard that many of them died in the mine.

368
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,680
If this goes out,...

369
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,000
...the police will be involved.

370
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:10,400
If this blows up, what do you think will happen?

371
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,120
Don't worry,it's safe for now. I understand.

372
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,720
I will do as we have agreed earlier.

373
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,180
All right,I'm hanging up now.

374
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,580
Come back here.

375
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,960
Is your head feeling better?

376
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,200
You do remember that. I thought you were busy shopping.

377
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,480
Shopping? How did you know?

378
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,090
It's none of your business.

379
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,940
I didn't do much shopping.

380
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,120
Xuanbing wanted to meet to bid me farewell.

381
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,560
Why didn't you go with her?

382
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,760
I can't leave now.

383
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,890
Boss Hu wants the villagers to relocate..

384
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,170
...as the mining vein is underneath the village.

385
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,520
If they begin operation, the village might be destroyed.

386
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:48,360
Are you saying that...

387
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,600
...you're afraid the villagers won't cooperate and create chaos?

388
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,760
You're right.

389
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,280
If there's chaos,will the villagers give in easily?

390
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:01,920
I'll help out.

391
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,720
I don't want...

392
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,250
...innocent people getting hurt.

393
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,520
The village head did many awful things...

394
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,680
...but the whole village can't suffer because of him.
