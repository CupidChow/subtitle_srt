1
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,800
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,160
Yu Lei.

3
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,200
People call him Boss Yu.

4
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,300
He must be your leader.

5
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,900
No,officer,I don't know him.

6
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:58,240
Using guns and trading cultural relics.

7
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,680
Don't you know that your boss is a great person?

8
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,960
No,officer. I really don't know him.

9
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,920
Isn't that Uncle Liu we met when we first came to Lintao?

10
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,720
Let's go.

11
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,000
Come with me. -Me again?

12
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,260
What smell is this?

13
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,360
It should be sulphur. -Sister.

14
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,680
It's firecrackers. -They are making bombs.

15
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,050
When is the wedding? -I've forgotten it's today.

16
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,000
They have found the tomb earlier but didn't do anything.

17
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,160
They are waiting for today. -The wedding will start soon.

18
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:32,800
Have you seen your Brother Zhuang?

19
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,460
Brother,when do we light the firecrackers?

20
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,360
Light it immediately when the bride comes out.

21
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,510
Look at this. Is this a camera?

22
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,050
It is. Why are you surprised? It's like you've never seen it.

23
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,490
Ensure your professionalism.

24
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,640
Check again.

25
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,659
It's time to light the firecrackers!

26
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,640
Do it!

27
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,200
Let's go!

28
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,840
Boss,it's police! -Quickly go down!

29
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,080
Both of you,stop them! -Sure.

30
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,680
Stop them!

31
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,260
Don't move!

32
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,020
Bring them away. -Don't move.

33
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,880
Officer Miao,you're great. You're swift.

34
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,200
Stop trying to flatter me. Some of them have entered.

35
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,720
Zhao,where are Professor Meng and the rest?

36
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,840
I've informed them. They are coming.

37
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,720
Such a huge hole. -Fei Fei. Xiao Zhuang.

38
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,800
Professor Meng. -Have you arrested them?

39
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,660
We have caught some of them. The rest have gone down.

40
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,880
These bandits have actually opened the tomb with explosives.

41
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,210
If something went wrong,the tomb would've been destroyed.

42
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,880
We shouldn't take too long. Let's go down quickly.

43
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,960
Okay. Xiao Ren,get ready.

44
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,880
Okay. -Let's go down the tomb.

45
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,200
Okay. -Follow me.

46
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,800
Professor Meng,those bandits are dangerous. Please don't go down.

47
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,120
You stay on the surface and help me to command.

48
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,280
No,I know more about the underground than you.

49
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,040
Professor Ren and you stay at the back. They may have guns.

50
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,760
You must be careful. -Okay.

51
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,040
Professor Meng,I'll go with you. -Okay.

52
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,640
You come over here. -What's it?

53
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,400
What's this,Officer Miao?

54
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,040
You can go down,but...

55
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,760
...you can't leave my sight.

56
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,090
Are you suspecting that I'm on their side?

57
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,450
You're the only witness during the robbery in the pawnshop.

58
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,240
Boss Yu and others are ruthless and armed.

59
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,370
They might hurt you.

60
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,080
Follow me. I'll protect you.

61
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,530
Let's go.

62
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,760
Zhuang Rui says it's his first time so he's nervous.

63
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,000
He wants me to protect him. -No.

64
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,860
No. -Well.....

65
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,080
Do I need her protection?

66
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,080
Professor Meng,I know you trust Zhuang Rui,...

67
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,960
...but I have my considerations.

68
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,760
Let's go. Stop talking.

69
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,680
Be careful of the steps. -Okay.

70
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,960
What are you doing? Let's go!

71
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,240
Why do you stop again? Anything? -No.

72
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,040
Then hurry! Move forward.

73
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,240
Boss,from my opinion,...

74
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,960
...we should've killed the lad at the pawnshop.

75
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,080
He even led the police here.

76
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,960
Hello,Miss Qin.

77
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,720
Am I disturbing you? -Not at all.

78
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,170
I'm getting ready to...

79
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,120
...go to the wedding.

80
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,920
I'm going to the wedding.

81
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,880
It's quiet. Yes,everyone is busy eating.

82
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,890
There is not much noise.

83
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,160
Sure,I'll call you back.

84
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,720
Hello,miss.

85
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,200
Ask your followers to not hurt Zhuang Rui.

86
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,360
Zhuang Rui? That worker from the pawnshop?

87
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,440
Yes. -Okay,I understand.

88
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,000
Fei Fei,Xiao Zhuang,are you ready?

89
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,920
Yes.

90
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,130
This is urgent. We have no time to analyse the structure of the tomb.

91
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,760
Xiao Hu,Xiao Li,guard here. If there's anything,contact us.

92
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,080
Okay. -Professor is right.

93
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,800
Professor Meng,Boss Yu and others are ruthless.

94
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,520
If you meet them,stay safe.

95
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,930
It's not our first time meeting the grave robbers. Don't worry.

96
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,840
Slowly. -Come down with me. Xiao Zhao.

97
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,120
Okay. -You stay here.

98
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,520
Yes. -Slowly.

99
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,120
What? Your hand is sweating. Are you nervous?

100
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,960
Look where you are going.

101
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,720
Xiao Li,what's this for?

102
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,080
This is a metal detector to detect if there is metal in the ground.

103
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:08,240
It's used to see whether there is a tomb underground.

104
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,720
It's highly advanced.

105
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,920
Professor Meng,look.

106
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,680
Look. -Professor Meng.

107
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,560
What's it? -Where are we now?

108
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,640
This is the route to the tomb. We'll continue to go further down.

109
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,040
I never thought that the murals are well-preserved here.

110
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,570
This means that the tomb has not been discovered before.

111
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,720
Are you certain? -If the tomb is uncovered,...

112
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,240
...there will be a lot of oxygen here. In a short while,...

113
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,360
...these murals will quickly fade and degrade.

114
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,720
Zhuang Rui,help me to light up here.

115
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,600
Stop!

116
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,000
Hurry!

117
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,120
They are in front!

118
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,000
Slow down!

119
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,960
Boss,where should we go? -To the right!

120
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,490
What's going on?

121
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,080
Xiao Li,what's going on?

122
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,080
Professor Meng,there is a trap within the tomb!

123
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,940
There may be traps in the tomb!

124
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,360
There are traps? Won't they be in danger?

125
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,340
Be careful!

126
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,339
Be careful!

127
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,330
Hurry and go!

128
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,090
Hurry and go!

129
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,600
No,boss,what's going on?

130
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,370
Are you asking me? I wanted to ask you,too.

131
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,000
No. Did you touch anything?

132
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,720
I didn't.

133
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,520
What's going on? -It's nothing.

134
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,880
It's just a small trap. It's common.

135
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,200
We have met with these before. Don't worry.

136
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,720
Be professional. Look at you.

137
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,080
Hurry and go!

138
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,600
Are you alright? -Officer Miao.

139
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,920
Do you think I look fine? You almost broke my arm.

140
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,080
Officer Miao,I know you want to catch the thief,...

141
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,210
...but you have to think about me. We're stuck together.

142
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,000
You aren't dead. Why do you talk so much?

143
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,220
Hurry and get up! -Look at me. How can I get up?

144
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,400
Get up!

145
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,320
Get up!

146
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,240
Officer Miao! Zhuang Rui! -Professor Meng!

147
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,200
Zhuang Rui! Are you two alright?

148
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,140
We're fine. -Are you alright?

149
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,500
We're alright.

150
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,320
We're not sure about the tomb's layout yet.

151
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,960
You two must be careful and protect yourself.

152
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,440
Besides,there are cultural relics inside the tomb.

153
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,120
We'll be careful. -What trap is this?

154
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,920
How can it still be activated after so long?

155
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,440
Do any of you bring coins?

156
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,240
Actually,the principle is simple. -It's magnetism.

157
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,720
You're clever. You've accidentally activated the trap.

158
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,280
All these spears will be released...

159
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,340
...and be attracted by the magnet to the ground.

160
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,610
Usually,such an ancient trap will lose its effectiveness.

161
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,800
It's rare to see this today.

162
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,040
So,we have to be alert and be careful.

163
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,440
Okay. -Let's go.

164
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,210
This is a wall. -This is Broken Dragon Stone Gate.

165
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,840
It's a kind of tomb trap.

166
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,320
Only tombs with status have it. Once the door closes down,...

167
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,720
...those who enter will be locked here...

168
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,880
...until they die out of hunger.

169
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,920
There seems to be many discoveries within this tomb.

170
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,360
Yes. -Does this mean we have to find...

171
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,960
...the switch?

172
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,920
This wall has just come down.

173
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,490
Boss Yu and the gang must be inside.

174
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,440
Is this the switch?

175
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,490
Why are you shocked?

176
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,280
The spears almost killed me.

177
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,130
Can you be more careful? It's dangerous here.

178
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,540
Professor Ren,look at the side. Is there a brick...

179
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,000
...that looks like this?

180
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,160
Yes.

181
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,720
It must be a pair of them. You have to press them together.

182
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,920
Professor Meng,why don't you do it?

183
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,400
I'll count to 3. Let's do this together.

184
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,640
1,2,3!

185
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,330
Why did nothing happen?

186
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,740
Where are they?

187
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,000
Why are you yelling? Does it hurt? -Didn't you yell,too?

188
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,480
The way up is closed.

189
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,720
Where are we now?

190
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,280
This must be a trap.

191
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,360
Iron chain?

192
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,820
If there's an iron chain,it means this is the route to the tomb.

193
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,000
There doesn't seem to be an entrance here.

194
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,640
There will be one.

195
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,440
Can you hear me?

196
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,400
Officer Miao! -Officer Miao!

197
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,660
Officer Miao! -Officer Miao!

198
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,240
Keep quiet.

199
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,780
Hello! Can you hear us?

200
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,080
Is there anyone?

201
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,320
Professor Meng!

202
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,080
Professor Ren!

203
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,690
Hello,officer!

204
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,290
Is there anyone? -They are down there.

205
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,480
Can you hear us?

206
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,250
They are down there.

207
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,560
Here,I'll count to 3. 1,2,3!

208
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,400
Again! 1,2,3!

209
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,200
The mechanism is not working. What do we do now?

210
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,320
Professor Ren! -You.....

211
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,960
Can you be quiet?

212
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,280
Am I not asking for help? Aren't you going to find a way?

213
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,120
Professor Meng,Professor Ren,can you hear us?

214
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,890
Hello,is anyone there?

215
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,610
Are you alright?

216
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,480
I feel like...

217
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,200
...I can't breathe.

218
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,440
Sit here.

219
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:09,560
Here. It's alright. Come. Sit down.

220
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,040
What's going on? Your hands are sweating badly. Are you nervous?

221
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,240
Watch your steps.

222
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,520
Do you have claustrophobia?

223
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,280
Why did you come down if you're claustrophobic? It's dangerous.

224
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:41,200
Stop talking nonsense. How would I know I will be trapped here?

225
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,040
Don't panic. Take a deep breath.

226
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,980
I'll think of a way.

227
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,280
Professor Meng!

228
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,600
The geodetic display indicates the underground structure is unstable.

229
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,440
It may collapse.

230
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,440
Collapse? We don't see anything here.

231
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,700
Professor,it may be underneath.

232
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,970
Could it be.....

233
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,840
Sand to prevent thieves? -What's this?

234
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,280
Well.....

235
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:58,880
Well..... -Well.....

236
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,240
Will this sand continue to come down?

237
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,160
Yes,it will.

238
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,400
I've read a book recording this. This is the tomb's trap.

239
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,330
If we don't leave here quickly,we'll be buried in sand here.

240
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,300
Can you help me to unlock this?

241
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,840
Officer Miao.

242
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,880
Where is it?

243
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,000
I found it.

244
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,960
Officer Miao,calm down.

245
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,800
Don't you want me to unlock the handcuffs?

246
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,680
Officer Miao,...

247
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,720
...handcuffs need this to be unlocked.

248
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,930
Why don't you sit here and rest?

249
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,600
I found it.

250
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,400
Professor Meng,are you alright?

251
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,640
We're fine.

252
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,440
Professor,the stone door is opened.

253
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,320
Here.

254
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,680
Let's go. We'll go down. -Okay.

255
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,160
Wait. Give me the light.

256
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,320
Officer Miao,Xiao Zhuang,are you alright?

257
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,240
We're fine.

258
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,840
It's good that you're fine. You've worried us.

259
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,400
Why did this mechanism start to work again?

260
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,680
I found that...

261
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,580
...and opened a new route.

262
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,210
Let's go and have a look inside.

263
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,480
There are so many burial items. This must be the main tomb.

264
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,230
Yes,we've finally found it.

265
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,680
It seems that the legend of Qi Yuan is true.

266
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,640
What legend is that? -I read about Qi Yuan's family.

267
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,380
In the book,he wrote that his eyes have special abilities.

268
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,540
His eyes have special abilities?

269
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,240
Qi Yuan is more than a general who fights in the battlefield.

270
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,170
He was also a collector and has collected many items.

271
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,160
No wonder most of the burial items here aren't from Tang Dynasty.

272
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,400
They were made earlier.

273
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,880
Qi Yuan is very confident in his collection. He declared...

274
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,960
...his eyes can differentiate between fake and real items.

275
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,520
In other words,there are no fake items in his collection.

276
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,040
This needs to be verified.

277
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,400
Xiao Ren,hurry,manage the cultural relics...

278
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,010
...and make a record. -Yes.

279
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,690
Officer Miao,I never thought you're so aggressive.

280
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,160
Thanks for your help today.

281
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,720
You're welcome. I should do it. Does my performance...

282
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,480
...earn the police's trust?

283
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,720
We'll observe you from now on. -Okay.

284
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,880
Professor Meng!

285
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,100
There seems to be no more danger here.

286
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,760
I'll watch the door to prevent Yu and his gang from escaping.

287
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,880
Okay. Be careful.

288
00:36:59,120 --> 00:36:59,600
Wait.

289
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,520
Bring this along. If there's anything,inform us.

290
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:05,920
What about me?

291
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,000
Stay here and help Professor Meng. -Okay.

292
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,960
What do we do,boss? There seems to be no mechanism here.

293
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,080
Blow it up. -Blow up the door?

294
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,160
Do you have other ways?

295
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,560
Is every single grave good in this sarcophagus invaluable?

296
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,400
This is the most well-preserved tomb I've ever seen these years.

297
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,200
Professor says,the value of the relic is immeasurable in money.

298
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,020
They're significant to the discovery of history and culture.

299
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,920
Can I take a look? -Here.

300
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,680
Be careful!

301
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,760
So,can you determine the era of this?

302
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,160
I'm not sure of this.

303
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,120
Here. This is the Four Symbols Pattern.

304
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,920
It's originated from Han Dynasty.

305
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,440
It was popular in the Northern and Southern Dynasties.

306
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,800
However,there is a horn on the Azure Dragon.

307
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,720
It's a unique characteristic in Han Dynasty.

308
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,580
Therefore,this relic was made during Han Dynasty.

309
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,880
Han Dynasty?

310
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,440
This should be Yunnan Jade. -Right.

311
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:50,480
However,during Han Dynasty,Yunnan was at the border of China.

312
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,760
There was no record of extensive mining of jade.

313
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,370
How can they have such sophisticated polishing technique?

314
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:02,040
Xiao Zhuang is so young but knowledgeable.

315
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,440
Not bad at all.

316
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,890
It's powerful. Should we make it even more powerful?

317
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,420
I'm blowing up the door,not killing myself.

318
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,240
Move over!
