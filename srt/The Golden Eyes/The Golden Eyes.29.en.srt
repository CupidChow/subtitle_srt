1
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,000
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 29

3
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:46,320
I could get it right all the time...

4
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,560
...because I have a pair of eyes that could penetrate jadeite.

5
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,520
Huang Fuyun is losing. -I'll take over from here.

6
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,880
Zhuang Rui,are you mad? -Fold.

7
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,170
There's no harm trying.

8
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,330
I didn't expect you to cut it up on the spot.

9
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,220
I trust your discerning eyes.

10
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,320
How did you know that I was captured by Bo Gang?

11
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,290
I heard that Hu Rong's daughter was kidnapped...

12
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,170
...and you saved her but was captured instead...

13
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,540
...so I sent some men to investigate.

14
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,200
You're buying something already?

15
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,400
This doesn't look particularly unique.

16
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:40,920
Pengfei.

17
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,760
Where did you get the equipments and clothes from?

18
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,840
I don't remember seeing it earlier.

19
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,460
Qin Xuanbing gave it to us.

20
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,560
I gained the ability to discern between jade and mere stones.

21
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,250
I inherited the family business and made a lot of profit.

22
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,600
Later,I fell ill and all my organs failed.

23
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,300
Blindness ensued and I lost all five senses.

24
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,200
My will to live was lost.

25
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,400
Lost all five senses?

26
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,610
Investigate anything about Feng Quan on the market,...

27
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,680
...focusing on Inner Mongolia. -Yes.

28
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,080
Miss Xiaojia,have a seat.

29
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,040
You're beautiful as always.

30
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,040
Did you make some soup for me?

31
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,700
Who said it's for you? You think too much.

32
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,400
Aren't you here to see me?

33
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,400
Didn't it feel empty while I was gone?

34
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,920
As if something was missing.

35
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,640
You're right. It was the incessant nagging.

36
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,440
Is there anything else? -No.

37
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,040
I felt an emptiness.

38
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,280
It's only when I see you...

39
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,720
...that I feel alive.

40
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,080
I like that. Do you have more?

41
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:15,480
There's more where that came from.

42
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,730
There were times...

43
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,900
...when I felt like giving up on life.

44
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,200
It's true.

45
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,280
The only thing that kept me alive...

46
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,640
...was the thought of seeing you again.

47
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,650
Even if.....

48
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,360
Even if it's just a glimpse.

49
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,160
Do you mean it?

50
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,280
I never thought...

51
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,780
...that I would miss someone so much.

52
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,680
Xiaorui is here. Let's check in on him.

53
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,520
All right. Let's check in on Xiaorui.

54
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:59,360
Xiaorui!

55
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,340
Miss Xiaojia brought something for you.

56
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,360
Feifei,you're here!

57
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,170
You ignored me but woke up at the sound of her name.

58
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,120
I'm sorry,Xiaojia. I don't feel well.

59
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,560
Well,Miss Xiaojia made the soup for you.

60
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,900
You must have some.

61
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,400
Look at you. You're skin and bones now.

62
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,640
Thank you but I'm not hungry.

63
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,080
Here.

64
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:47,840
Gently.

65
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,100
Look at you. You're in a declining state.

66
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,680
You don't go out now. It's unlike you.

67
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:58,640
Here.

68
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,880
Xiaorui,what's the big deal? Why are you acting like a lady?

69
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,160
She's right. Why are you acting like a lady?

70
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,320
I made chicken soup for you. Drink it while it's hot.

71
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,280
Drink it while it's hot.

72
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,640
Here you go, drink it while it's hot.

73
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,040
Thank you.

74
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,480
Drink it while it's hot. Do you want me to feed you?

75
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,280
Do you want Miss Xiaojia to feed you?

76
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,280
Xiaorui.

77
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,600
No matter what happens, you still have us.

78
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,000
That's right. We have been through a lot.

79
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,320
Didn't we? I hope that no matter what happens,...

80
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,560
...I will be with you all the way.

81
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,220
That's the way.

82
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,040
We are going to our usual place with Old Ma tomorrow.

83
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,760
Drink up.

84
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,780
I'm not hungry.

85
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,660
You still have to drink up. It's good for you.

86
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,180
Miss Xiaojia,why are you leaving in such a rush?

87
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,160
I haven't seen you in so long. I have a lot to tell you.

88
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,040
It's about the thing earlier.

89
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,280
What is it?

90
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,880
You said that you wanted to give the soup to Xiaorui.

91
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,040
Now that he has finished the soup,can't you say it now?

92
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,890
Stop playing around. I'll do it next time.

93
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,800
Miss Xiaojia! Next time?

94
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,200
It has to be this time. Miss Xiaojia,wait up!

95
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,640
I'm not done yet.

96
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,240
The soup you made was exceptionally tasty.

97
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,020
Xiaorui has finished the soup. The side show has finished.

98
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,640
Isn't it time for the main show now?

99
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,540
Come on.

100
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,850
I'm leaving now.

101
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,920
Don't you miss me at all?

102
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,120
You call ten times a day. It's annoying.

103
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,180
Who wants to miss you? -Miss Xiaojia.

104
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,080
It's good to honest.

105
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,420
You're cheeky.

106
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,960
I can wait for you.

107
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,480
Miss,there's a jade figurine in Inner Mongolia's black market.

108
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,560
It only has an eye and no other facial features.

109
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,600
It looks odd.

110
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,160
Only an eye? What does it look like?

111
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,820
The picture was taken using a phone. It's not clear.

112
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,280
Where is this jade figurine now?

113
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,080
It's in the hands of a Hailar's merchant.

114
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,120
I have sent men to get in touch with him.

115
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,040
It will then be shipped to Beijing soon.

116
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,040
You have to pay close attention to this.

117
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,000
Yes,miss. You don't have to worry.

118
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,440
My friend,look at this.

119
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,560
My friend,I have more of this.

120
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,450
I'm not interested.

121
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,760
You're selling Yuehuang as Haihuang. Don't play me.

122
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,200
Listen to yourself. Can't you tell the difference?

123
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,800
This is authentic Haihuang. -Nonsense.

124
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,770
The line and texture are not clear enough.

125
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,770
Do you think I'm a child? -I can't help it if you say so.

126
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,720
You can't tell the real thing because you don't have the skill.

127
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,450
If you don't believe me, let's get an expert here.

128
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,680
Are you playing with me? Are you not admitting it?

129
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,600
Let's go. I'll bring you to an expert.

130
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,400
No one wants it even if it's free.

131
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,720
You're being unreasonable. -You're talking back.

132
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,450
You have problematic eyes. -Problematic eyes??

133
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,040
What did you say? -What counterfeit?

134
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,520
What? -Can't you talk nicely?

135
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,600
Don't you dare beat me up. -I'll beat you up.

136
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,200
What? We'll go to the police.

137
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,560
Come have a look.

138
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,320
Xiaorui,was that Yuehuang or Haihuag?

139
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,560
It was a plain item that isn't worth much.

140
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,760
Sir,come have a look.

141
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,760
Come have a look. -Look at this.

142
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,420
Have a look.

143
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,600
Good eye. It's a porcelain vase from the Yuan Dynasty.

144
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,120
Is it? -If you like it,I'll do this.

145
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,520
I'll give you 70% off.

146
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,600
This has been in my family for years.

147
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,210
It has never left my family.

148
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,720
If my son isn't getting married and needs to buy a house,...

149
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,800
...I wouldn't have sold it. If you like it,name your price.

150
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,140
This is a counterfeit.

151
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,240
It's a man-made porcelain.

152
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,240
It has an unnatural matt surface.

153
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,320
The stripes on the glazed surface are also clumped together.

154
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,360
The stripes are unnaturally even.

155
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,740
You didn't even do a final polishing.

156
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,120
How did he manage to see that?

157
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,880
We're so unlucky today.

158
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,360
We can't even find one decent thing around here.

159
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,520
Xiaorui! -See you.

160
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,000
Xiaorui,what's with you? You're so moody.

161
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,250
I can't trust anyone or anything anymore.

162
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,560
They're all lies.

163
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,780
I can't take this anymore.

164
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,360
What happened in Myanmar...

165
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,860
...that made him this way?

166
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,040
I don't know.

167
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,120
There was some danger...

168
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,440
...but aren't they all in the past?

169
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,440
Brother Ma,aren't I doing fine?

170
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,920
This child.....

171
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,880
What can you see?

172
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,120
Is he in love?

173
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,560
Brother Ma,how could you tell? Who is he in love with?

174
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,980
Do I know she is?

175
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,080
Are you out of your mind? You're always with him.

176
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,040
I should ask you who the person is.

177
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,330
You were the one who said that he's in love.

178
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,240
I have 30 years of relationship experience.

179
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,320
With my 30 years of experience,...

180
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,400
...I can tell that it's about love.

181
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,120
Or else, he wouldn't act...

182
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,720
...like he has lost himself.

183
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,420
Brother Ma,you're right.

184
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,720
It's the same feeling that I have whenever I see...

185
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,720
...Miss Xiaojia.

186
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,360
I also think that it's a forbidden love.

187
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,160
A forbidden love?

188
00:16:59,320 --> 00:16:59,980
Who is that?

189
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,960
Could it be...

190
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,800
...Pengfei?

191
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,589
From experience,it can't be him.

192
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,040
I have Miss Xiaojia already.

193
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,800
Sister, the traffic police found...

194
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,200
...a black car in Section 7 coming from Inner Mongolia.

195
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,760
When they went and check,...

196
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,640
...they found illegal jade in the car boot.

197
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,530
What about the people? -They escaped in another car.

198
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,880
After investigation, we found two men.

199
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,440
They're Zhang Cungang and Lee Er'Niu.

200
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,400
Zhang Cungang just came out of prison. Lee Er'Niu is jobless.

201
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,320
This is Liu Jiagui.

202
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,200
Who is that?

203
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,680
Liu Jiagui had been in prison for illegal reselling.

204
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,400
He had dealings with Zhang Cungang.

205
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,880
Not bad. You did well this time.

206
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:33,720
Tonight,at an alley in south gate at Dongcheng District,...

207
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,560
...Liu Jiagui is making a deal and Zhang Cungang could be there.

208
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,420
What's going on? You're becoming a good detective.

209
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,840
It's all thanks to Chief Ding...

210
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,880
...who suggested we combine two cases.

211
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,880
Team B has been monitoring Liu Jiagui...

212
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,160
...so they gave me all the information.

213
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,600
I knew it. You can't suddenly become a good detective.

214
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,480
Surround the south gate alleys. -Yes.

215
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,520
Sister,our intelligence informed us it's 7.00 p.m.

216
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,680
It's already 7.20 p.m.

217
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,490
Could they have changed the location?

218
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,010
There's no rush. We'll wait it out.

219
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,440
Target has appeared. -Target has appeared.

220
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,680
Don't look back! -Roger that.

221
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,020
Roger that.

222
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,200
You're here. Did you bring the goods?

223
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:02,730
Let's go.

224
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,280
Don't stay too close or you'll get exposed. Stay safe.

225
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,180
Roger that.

226
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,920
Where's Brother Gui? -Did you bring the goods?

227
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,380
Where's the money?

228
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,520
Sister,when do we make a move? -I order you to seal up the place.

229
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:41,440
I was followed by the police but I managed to escape them.

230
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:47,560
You were followed? -Don't worry.

231
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,280
It's nothing. Or else, how would I be here?

232
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:54,880
Go!

233
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,400
Police! -Freeze!

234
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,260
Stop! -Freeze!

235
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,240
Freeze!

236
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,980
Behave yourselves. One of them escaped.

237
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,400
Bring them to the station. -Move.

238
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,720
It feels exquisite and warm, sturdy and hard enough.

239
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,960
From the looks of it,it's an authentic Qin Han Dynasty antique.

240
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,840
This type of jade figurine is a rare item.

241
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,840
Where did he get this?

242
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,850
What is it? -Hello,Sister Fei.

243
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,240
Both of them insisted that they are only delivering goods.

244
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,570
However,they're unable to name the item nor the recipient.

245
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,720
Thank you for your work. Send someone to look for Liu Jiagui.

246
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,720
Tell me if you found anything. -Yes.

247
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,620
Bye. -It was dangerous this time.

248
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,360
Feifei,where did you get this from?

249
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,240
Inner Mongolia. -Inner Mongolia?

250
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:46,140
Before Qin Han Dynasty,tombs in Inner Mongolia are uncommon.

251
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,610
From the looks of it,...

252
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,900
...this jade figure is a burial item of the tomb master.

253
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,560
Furthermore, this has been freshly dug.

254
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,000
Do you mean that a tomb has been raided in Inner Mongolia?

255
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,160
I will report this to the authorities for an investigation.

256
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,120
I will send people from the Gems Association to assist you.

257
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,000
What do you say? -That would be great.

258
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,860
Don't mention it. -Thank you. Feifei,I'm leaving.

259
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,480
Take care. -All right. Goodbye.

260
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,840
Grandfather Gu, I want to go,too.

261
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,020
You want to go,too?

262
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,040
My case is related to this so there must be some clues.

263
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,600
I might be able to help out.

264
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,240
Well,I'll have someone to assist you on behalf of...

265
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,280
...the Gems Association. What do you think?

266
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,330
Does it mean you agree to it?

267
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,640
Thank you,Grandfather Gu! -All right.

268
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,930
Who will be that assistant?

269
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,580
Are you really asking?

270
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,040
What's wrong? You look like a squashed tomato.

271
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,000
Is anything bothering you?

272
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,840
I don't understand the antique industry.

273
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,760
Everyone thinks only of the profit and is willing to backstab others.

274
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,160
Are there no truths left?

275
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,240
I joined this industry because I like it.

276
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,100
Now I am doubting myself for joining this industry.

277
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,380
When I was younger,I complained about every industry.

278
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,840
I later realized that it's because we have not seen enough.

279
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,920
In this life,finding something that you like isn't easy.

280
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,880
Doing something that you like is even harder.

281
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,360
Which is why you can't give up just after one obstacle.

282
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,000
This is being unfair to the thing that you like.

283
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,240
Besides,there are many success stories in the antiques industry.

284
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,480
What if the more I understand it, the more I dislike it?

285
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,160
This is normal.

286
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,840
There are many sides to everything.

287
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,680
You feel this way because you have seen the ugly side of men.

288
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,280
This is especially apparent in this industry.

289
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,120
Who will not be attracted when presented with treasure?

290
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,560
Greed will come next.

291
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,320
However,you can't reject the beauty in the world...

292
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,760
...just because of this.

293
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,680
Also,we're putting together...

294
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,720
...missing parts to make them whole...

295
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,120
...and beautiful again.

296
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,120
Are we doing that? -Of course.

297
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,480
It could be difficult at times.

298
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,320
Putting together items is easy but putting together the heart is not.

299
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,920
However, it is not impossible

300
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,800
I understand.

301
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,200
You have made a name in the Myanmar auction...

302
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,640
...and you've surpassed the local stronghold. After this,...

303
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,360
...you would need to brace for more trouble.

304
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,880
If you want to clear your head,...

305
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,880
...why don't you take a walk outside?

306
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,960
Avoid thinking too much.

307
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,280
Don't stay at home by yourself. You'll get nothing out of it.

308
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,680
Okay.

309
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,200
All right,I have nagged enough.

310
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,160
I won't say anymore. I'll leave you to think about it.

311
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,920
All right? -Okay.

312
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,090
I'll see you off.

313
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,120
There's no need. I'll be off.

314
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,000
Xiaorui,we just saw Uncle De.

315
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,040
Yes,he came over to talk to me. -Uncle De is the best.

316
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,890
I gave you so many advice and even took you to Panjiayuan.

317
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,120
They're useless. Uncle De said a few word...

318
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,320
...and you look in high spirits now.

319
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,560
Where have you been? Where's Feifei?

320
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,660
I think she's on a case. I don't know the whole thing.

321
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,240
However,I did hear that she will be going to Inner Mongolia.

322
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,200
She's on a case? Is she on the police force again?

323
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,040
I don't know what happened but she is reinstated.

324
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,360
What about Inner Mongolia? -It won't be for a few days.

325
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,520
What are you doing there? -It's like this.

326
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,560
Recently,...

327
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,700
...we got a jade figurine that was smuggled.

328
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,160
The jade figurine only has an eye.

329
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,280
It seems interesting. Officer Ding wants you to see it.

330
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,400
One eye? -From the robbery at Linghe,...

331
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:25,560
...you're related to this jade. What do you think?

332
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,340
Are you saying that...

333
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,480
...this jade figurine case has to do with Qin family?

334
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:45,280
Whether it's Gansu or Myanmar,...

335
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,260
...Qin Xuanbing's target is always something to do with eyes.

336
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,440
Don't you think that there is a connection?

337
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,400
Has she mentioned anything to you? -No.

338
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,200
Anything about eyes? -No.

339
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,880
This jade figurine was shipped from Inner Mongolia.

340
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,200
Professor Meng suspects that a tomb has been illegally raided.

341
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,600
She's going to bring a team to save the tomb.

342
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,000
I will be joining her to investigate the case.

343
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,520
Would you like to join me?

344
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:35,640
No.

345
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:39,440
Yes.

346
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,520
Xiaorui,you're a legend in the jade and antique world.

347
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,300
Many big bosses wants to work with you...

348
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,000
...but you chose to come to the grassland with me.

349
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,860
Isn't it a pity?

350
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,560
Professor Meng,whenever I work with you,...

351
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,080
...I learned a lot.

352
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,280
As long as it's not a trouble,...

353
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,010
...I would like to follow you on every field work.

354
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,620
It's no trouble at all.

355
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,400
You're young and you have the desire to learn.

356
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,240
You'll go far. -Thank you,Professor Meng.

357
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,400
I try my best. I will work harder.

358
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,450
That's good.

359
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,560
Welcome. -Hello,County Head Zhao.

360
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,320
County Head Zhao,I have something to confirm with you.

361
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,760
It's about our guide. Have you gotten one?

362
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,130
I was about to bring this up.

363
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,880
There are not many of us here that could speak Mandarin.

364
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,280
I found one of us that could speak Mandarin.

365
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,040
He is also familiar with the area. However,...

366
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,520
Is there any problem? -This lad is stubborn.

367
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,000
When he heard it was the archaeological team,he refused.

368
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,520
Does he have any misunderstanding about the archaeological team?

369
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,080
Should we talk to him? -I'll talk to him,too.

370
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,480
Hold on,where do you think you're going?

371
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,680
You're an assistant and he's an outsider.

372
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,880
Will he listen to you?

373
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,480
I am from the Gem Association after all.

374
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,920
I'll go. It will be easier if I were to do it.

375
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,460
All right. Xiaogu,you'll go with County Head Zhao.

376
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,040
Try to persuade him. -Yes,don't worry.

377
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,900
I will definitely bring him here.

378
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,240
Thank you for your help. -You're welcome. Let's go.

379
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,080
All right.

380
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,960
Xiaogu,it's over there.

381
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,960
It's right ahead.

382
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:23,640
Let's go over there. -Okay.

383
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,920
I'm not doing it! Don't bother me with such things.

384
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,840
You!

385
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,240
Ba Te'er, you can speak Mandarin...

386
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,920
...and you're familiar with the area.

387
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,720
Don't you embarrass me.

388
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,360
Are you glaring at me? -I'll talk to him.

389
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,800
Brother Ba Te'er,I heard from Count Head Zhao about you.

390
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,400
You are a walking map of the grassland.

391
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,920
If you don't help us this time,...

392
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,860
...we would be at our wits end.

393
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,960
County Head, look at the grassland.

394
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,780
What has it become?

395
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,200
Things have not been looking good for the past years.

396
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,400
If it goes on like this, what will my horse eat?

397
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,160
It's the landform. The government is doing something about it.

398
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,090
Besides, this is hardly a problem.

399
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,440
Count Head Zhao,let me do it. Brother Ba Te'er,...

400
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,780
...we are actually..... -Listen up!

401
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,440
You outsiders keep digging up the land for development.

402
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,840
Did you know that grassland relies on rain and underground water?

403
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,360
You have destroyed the underground water.

404
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:54,480
Now grass couldn't grow! -Brother Ba Te'er,calm down.

405
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,600
There must be a misunderstanding.

406
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,760
We are an archaeological team.

407
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,760
We abide by the rules.

408
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,280
You don't have to worry about the environment...

409
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,080
...or the underground water source.

410
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,640
Listen here,if a shovel touches the ground,...

411
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,720
...I won't do it! -If you don't believe me,...

412
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,600
...come with me to the archaeological site...

413
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:19,160
...and you'll see for yourself. -Just come with us.

414
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:19,840
Let us go.

415
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,720
Professor Meng,is there anything on the location of the tomb?

416
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,650
There's no definite location yet.

417
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,280
Although the jade figurine...

418
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,120
...is from the grassland in this area...

419
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,320
...but we have yet to find any proof of the tomb.

420
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,530
It felt like we're back in Gansu again.

421
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,560
Although we're in the grasslands now,..

422
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,360
...slightly different from the situation in Gansu.

423
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,400
However,...

424
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,280
...if we have a guide who's familiar with the surroundings,...

425
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,140
...it would make our work easier.

426
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,240
Are you saying that the local custom is involved?

427
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:17,320
Its customary for the Hans to have a ground burial.

428
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,040
This grassland has a wide area.

429
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,280
So most people might have chosen grander burials...

430
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,480
...like a heaven burial or a cremation.

431
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,400
In comparison,ground burials would have been less common.

432
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,600
This makes it easier to locate the tomb.

433
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,320
You're quick.

434
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:42,440
The search for Qi Heng tomb the last time was difficult...

435
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,840
...due to the change in topography.

436
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,760
However,this time it's a wide grassland.

437
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,440
Where there's unusual grass growth,...

438
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,580
...there will most likely be a tomb underneath.

439
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,600
Professor Meng,I've brought the grassland guide here.

440
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,000
Come in!

441
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,760
Welcome. -I have yet to agree.

442
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,280
You're welcome to just pay a visit.

443
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,240
Ba Te'er,nice to meet you. I'll show you these equipment.

444
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,240
Thank you for your help. -All these have various functions.

445
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,240
These are all important for our archaeological work.

446
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,880
This is a metal detector.

447
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,840
As the name suggests,...

448
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,440
...it locates metal underground.

449
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,760
Their shapes and sizes. We use this...

450
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,860
...to determine the location of the underground tomb.

451
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,920
This is a 3D scanner.

452
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,480
This give us an overall view of the archaeological area.

453
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,120
A laser will shine...

454
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,760
...on an object and keep going back and forth.

455
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,880
We will receive a digital data...

456
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,640
...which will produce a clear picture like this.

457
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,210
Look at this.

458
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,120
Look at this,this and this.

459
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,220
You seem like professionals.

460
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,440
What do you think? Do you believe me now?

461
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,240
You have a lot to learn.

462
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,080
Did he think we were scammers?
