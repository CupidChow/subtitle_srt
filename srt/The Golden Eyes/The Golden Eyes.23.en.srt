1
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,500
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,500
Episode 23

3
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,140
What about the man I asked you to find?

4
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,240
We have another death today.

5
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,240
We found a man and a woman yesterday.

6
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,560
I think they know each other.

7
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,600
He seem to be injured but he'll recover soon.

8
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,060
Outsiders are better.

9
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,810
If they die, no one will suspect anything.

10
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,800
Watch them. Don't let them escape.

11
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,680
All right. -You can also tie them up.

12
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,720
Sure.

13
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,000
Zhuang Rui.

14
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,280
Zhuang Rui,get up!

15
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,640
Hurry up if you don't want to work here all your life.

16
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,280
Get up. Do you trust me? Get yourself together.

17
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,800
Put on your shoes. Let's go.

18
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,290
What's going on?

19
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,020
Move aside!

20
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,320
What's going on right now?

21
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,720
I'm sorry but you can't leave.

22
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,660
Do you know what you are doing now?

23
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,880
Unlawful restraint and causing intentional harm...

24
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,420
...is a life sentence.

25
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,640
That does sound intimidating.

26
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,360
Do you want money? Tell us your price and let us go.

27
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,760
What do you think? Should I let you stay here...

28
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,290
...or send you back inside?

29
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,610
Beat them up!

30
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,720
Zhuang Rui,come here.

31
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,080
Where do I go?

32
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,400
Go over there.

33
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,800
Let's go! -Let them go.

34
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,520
Are you all right?

35
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,400
Don't worry, I'll bring you back to Beijing.

36
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,440
My eyes. -Let's go that way.

37
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,970
Finish your meal quick. We have to get to work.

38
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,240
If we don't capture him, you will explain to the boss.

39
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,090
The man is injured. He can't have gone far.

40
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,760
He must be hiding in the forest.

41
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,280
There's no rush. We'll a search after our meal.

42
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,400
Enough talking. Eat up!

43
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,400
Someone's there. Go over and check!

44
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,410
Let's go.

45
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,320
Quick!

46
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,120
GO!

47
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,040
This is bad. I can't see clearly.

48
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,530
Stay here. Don't leave this place,...

49
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,370
...no matter what happens.

50
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,760
I've promised to bring you back to Beijing.

51
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,120
I'll do it.

52
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,360
You fight well.

53
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,400
Tell me,where is he hiding?

54
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,930
You're still not saying anything?

55
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,040
It's all right.

56
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,040
With you as bait, I'm sure he will come out.

57
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,920
Take her away!

58
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,960
Who are you? I'm calling the police.

59
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,500
No need for that. I'm with the police.

60
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,960
Officer Miao! They're bullying foreigners...

61
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,420
...and now they're extorting money from us.

62
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,410
Add me as your friend on WeChat.

63
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,000
Officer Miao,what is this?

64
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,080
You can go there...

65
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,600
...but don't leave my sight.

66
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,000
Take her away. -Let's go.

67
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,020
Xiaofei, please don't go too far.

68
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,900
I feel cold.

69
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,400
Take it. -Never mind,you seem cold,too.

70
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,040
I'm craving for a bowl of hot soup right now.

71
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,850
Instant noodles are fine,too.

72
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,010
There's lightning.

73
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,210
Won't we get struck by lightning here?

74
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,380
That won't happen.

75
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,600
My mother always say...

76
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,800
...that lightning will strike guilty people.

77
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,860
I only like to show off my wealth so it should be fine.

78
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,160
All right,no more lightning! I give up.

79
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,040
I haven't been good to Miss Xiaojia.

80
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,680
I have yet to be responsible for her.

81
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:52,890
I'm not a man.

82
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,130
Then I'd better stay away from you.

83
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,760
I only want to treat her well...

84
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,600
...but she doesn't even give me a chance.

85
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,320
I wonder if she even thinks about me.

86
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,400
It looks like it's going to rain.

87
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,800
Let's find a shelter.

88
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,540
Is this where we're going to spend the night?

89
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,040
This is all we have. Unless you prefer to sleep in the rain.

90
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,440
There's a ghost!

91
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,920
Are you all right?

92
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,010
Why is there a body here?

93
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,690
There're injuries to his head.

94
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,520
There's dust under his fingernails...

95
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,580
...so he must be a nearby mine worker.

96
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,240
Why is his body here?

97
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,640
His body has yet to be stiff so this must be recent.

98
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,240
Someone must have thrown the body here.

99
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,520
We just escaped a bad place and now we enter another.

100
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,600
Why am I so unlucky?

101
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,800
I am rich,after all.

102
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,410
Don't tell me we're spending the night with the body?

103
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,440
You don't have to. You can sleep in the rain.

104
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,320
I think this is the price to pay for being rich.

105
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,360
Wait up!

106
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,560
Goodness.

107
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,210
Are we spending the night here?

108
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,570
Move over there.

109
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,599
Why do you keep following me?

110
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,640
Miss,it's too dangerous here.

111
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,410
Your father is worried for you.

112
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,680
Tell my father,...

113
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,640
...I'm not afraid. He doesn't need to be involved.

114
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,690
When I have found Zhuang Rui, he will be the first to know.

115
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:44,920
Miss,...

116
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,000
...it's not my place to say this.

117
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,600
The forest is a dangerous place.

118
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,330
If you come out here and couldn't find him,...

119
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,600
...how will I tell Mr. Qin if something happens to you?

120
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,960
Besides,your father has his own plans.

121
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,680
You're really hadn't thought this out.

122
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,660
I don't care how you will tell him.

123
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,560
I will not go back no matter what.

124
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,340
Do I need to repeat myself?

125
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,480
Miss,you seem determined. What about this?

126
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,770
I'll bring some of our men here.

127
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,840
The bad guys are heavily armed.

128
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,360
You won't be able to go against them yourself.

129
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,360
Is that all right?

130
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,080
Sure.

131
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,480
Tell our men to be discreet.

132
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,800
We couldn't find Zhuang Rui. We're widening our search...

133
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,820
...but there's not much hope.

134
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,720
Did you find his two other friends?

135
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,720
No.

136
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,760
Stop the search for now. We'll continue tomorrow.

137
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:25,960
Yes.

138
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,200
Mother.

139
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,260
Are there news of them?

140
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,650
Well,send more men and widen the search area.

141
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,360
Things are not looking good now.

142
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,920
If we fall into their trap, the consequences will be bad.

143
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,080
If you stop the search now, what about Zhuang Rui?

144
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,680
You can't expect me to risk our men's lives.

145
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,370
I'll look for them myself. -Stop right there.

146
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,600
Look at you. This isn't the time to act this way.

147
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,290
You should return to your room.

148
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,840
I'm impressed. You injured a few of my men.

149
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,400
Tell me,...

150
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,100
...how should we settle this?

151
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,240
If you help me to find him, I promise your safety...

152
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,360
...and your release. What do you say?

153
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,680
Village head!

154
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,780
I'll keep her here for now. -Sure.

155
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,640
Feel free to do anything.

156
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,600
My men are resting after a long day.

157
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,680
Watch her for me.

158
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,480
Don't worry, I will watch her well.

159
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,680
You'll get it if she escapes.

160
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,690
You're still refusing to talk?

161
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,360
There's no rush, I have the time.

162
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,480
We'll take it slow.

163
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,320
Don't you like rescue missions?

164
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,880
I'll wait for you.

165
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,570
Where is this place?

166
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,090
This is.....

167
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,840
Tell me,...

168
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,640
...where are you hiding him?

169
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,080
You're won't tell me?

170
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,680
Take her away!

171
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,400
Xiaorui! -Xiaofei,Xiaoyun.

172
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,730
Why are you here by yourself? Where's Feifei?

173
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:19,360
I was in a daze. Feifei found me in a village.

174
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,960
We escaped together. -Is she looking for us now?

175
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,880
No. Kun Sha found us in the jungle...

176
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,640
...and she hid me inside a tree hole.

177
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,410
I don't remember anything after that.

178
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,240
The Hu family's men found blood stains on the car.

179
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,000
We figured you'd be injured so we rushed over here.

180
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,480
Get this,that good-for-nothing Hu Rong...

181
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,280
...locked us up and said that

182
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,740
it's for our own good.She clearly only cares for her daughter.

183
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,520
It's a good thing her daughter has a conscience.

184
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,520
She let us escape.

185
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,920
I don't blame her. She must have her reasons.

186
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,280
No,you nearly lost your life to save her daughter.

187
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,220
There's no time for that now. Let's look for Feifei.

188
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,530
There are footprints here. They must have gone that way.

189
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,320
I would take a bite if I were you.

190
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,440
Is the boy worth doing this for?

191
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,840
If Zhuang Rui is destined to live,he won't die.

192
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,960
He will come and save you.

193
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:53,770
That way,...

194
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,060
...both of us can return home.

195
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,770
He's not coming.

196
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,960
With you here,..

197
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,840
...I don't believe that he won't take the bait.

198
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,380
Feifei should be held hostage there.

199
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,740
The place right there.

200
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,240
Don't rush. Anger will bring about stupidity.

201
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,650
Stupidity will bring about death.

202
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,440
It's rich coming from you. -I'm being serious here.

203
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,280
I even thought of an idea.

204
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,240
An idea? Is it role play again?

205
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,880
Will you play a couple again?

206
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,920
We will act as locals this time.

207
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,460
We really do blend in with the locals.

208
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,480
The show has yet to begin.

209
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,380
You must remember what I told you.

210
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,600
You have to stay calm.

211
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,040
All you have to do is to go with the flow.

212
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,810
You must immerse yourself in your character.

213
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,320
That's enough talking. Let's go.

214
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:11,760
Hold on.

215
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,050
Perfect.

216
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,480
Hurry up.

217
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,360
You,over here.

218
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,160
Stop!

219
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,560
You!

220
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,960
Xiaofei,not bad.

221
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,930
Go after him!

222
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,040
Why did he go off script?

223
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,180
Well,it doesn't look too bad.

224
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,000
Let's go over there.

225
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,480
The weather is so hot.

226
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,520
I feel the same.

227
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,680
When will it rain?

228
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,120
I'm exhausted. -Me,too.

229
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,560
What do we do? -Didn't you have a plan?

230
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,360
Let's go.

231
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,600
What are you doing here? You have to go now!

232
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,400
Kun Sha will get here anytime. You have to leave now.

233
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,660
Hurry up. -The police serves the people.

234
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,480
The people can't sit back and do nothing.

235
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,400
Your memory has returned. -Yes,I'll get you out of here.

236
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,240
When did you learn to fight? -There's no time for that.

237
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,920
Hurry up. There'll be here soon.

238
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,680
Let's go. -Hurry!

239
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,200
Let's hurry up!

240
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,560
Stop!

241
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,160
Stop right there!

242
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,650
Don't open fire. We need him alive.

243
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,440
I dare you to run now!

244
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,400
Take him away!

245
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,620
Where should we go?

246
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,330
Let's go.

247
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:30,880
Hurry.

248
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,760
You didn't expect this, did you?

249
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,000
Listen up, you had better let us go!

250
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,160
My friend will not go easy on you.

251
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:27,440
Your friend? Do you mean him?

252
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,800
Thanks to him,I will have a scar on my face.

253
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,120
Tell me,...

254
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:49,640
...should I remove his eyes or put a gun to his head...

255
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,400
...and make it a quick death?

256
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,080
I'm the one you want. Take me instead.

257
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,320
Let them go.

258
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,280
No!

259
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,800
I had no idea...

260
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,170
...that you are a loyal man.

261
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,000
It's a pity that I don't serve you.

262
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:14,230
The fun has yet to begin.

263
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,929
Welcome,all of you.

264
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:39,600
I heard about your extraordinary gambling skills.

265
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:44,600
My men are not your match.

266
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,800
Let them go.

267
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,020
You can do as you wish to me.

268
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,850
That doesn't sound fun.

269
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,560
The more,the merrier,...

270
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,200
...don't you think?

271
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,280
Let's make a bet.

272
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,920
What do you want to bet on?

273
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,560
Your lives.

274
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,720
This gun can fire six bullets...

275
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,600
...and I have removed one of it.

276
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,280
Out of the five bullets, one of it is a real bullet.

277
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,920
Each of you will point the gun to your head...

278
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,560
...and open fire.

279
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,320
If all of you survive,...

280
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:50,760
...I will let you go. You have five seconds each.

281
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,440
Aren't you the good fighter?

282
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,320
I'll count to one. If I don't hear a gunshot,...

283
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,560
...they'll open fire.

284
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,360
Five,...

285
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,130
...four,...

286
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:24,960
...three,...

287
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,600
...two..... -Fei!

288
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,330
There's no need to get nervous.

289
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,840
It's your turn.

290
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,840
Hold it tight.

291
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,280
I have imagined dying a heroic death many times.

292
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,840
I can't believe that I will die for a bet!

293
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,080
Xiaorui,when you return, take care of Miss Xiaojia for me.

294
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,200
Also,my bank cards are underneath my bed in Siheyuan.

295
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,400
It's an honour to have known you.

296
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,580
We'll meet again in the next life!

297
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,240
Both of you, who will do it first?

298
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,840
Zhuang Rui.

299
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,920
Xiaoyun.

300
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:10,840
Pengfei.

301
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,360
You must return safely.

302
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,130
That's enough talking.

303
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:22,840
Feifei.

304
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,880
It's all right now.

305
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,240
The King of Gambling,...

306
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,520
...your chances are slim now.

307
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,360
Do it!

308
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,400
I'm not the King of Gambling. I'm just a common man.

309
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,560
I am afraid of death,too.

310
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,640
Having all of you as my friends...

311
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,770
...is enough for me.

312
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,880
Let me remember your faces. -Five!

313
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,410
I will not forget all of you.

314
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,460
We'll meet again in the next life.

315
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,440
Four!

316
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:16,960
Three!

317
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,000
Zhuang Rui! -Xiaorui!

318
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,040
Two!
