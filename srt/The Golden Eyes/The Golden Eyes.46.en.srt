1
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,800
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Episode 46

3
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,399
I think I know how I obtained my Golden Eyes.

4
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,120
How?

5
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,560
Feifei,do you still remember that during the pawn shop robbery,...

6
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,400
...I was hit by the jade and then electrocuted by a wire?

7
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,200
My colleagues from evidence department said that...

8
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,840
...the buzzer broke from the gunfight and electricity leaked.

9
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,370
However,you didn't seem to be electrocuted.

10
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,760
I was.

11
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,210
It's just that my body seemed to have absorbed the electricity.

12
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,140
How could the electricity be absorbed by your body?

13
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,810
My body could not absorb the electricity,...

14
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,160
...but the current that entered my eyes was absorbed. Look.

15
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,960
Feng Quan was hit by the meteorite and afterwards,the lightning.

16
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,680
In other words, the Golden Eyes originated...

17
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,720
...as a result of the dual action of meteorite and electric current.

18
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,520
Both of these are essential for the creation of Golden Eyes.

19
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,520
You're awake.

20
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,780
Here,drink the medicine. It's not hot anymore.

21
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,360
Dear.

22
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:09,960
You.....

23
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,600
We can eat meat today.

24
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,120
Look.

25
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,000
It's indeed gold!

26
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,720
After three years,Feng Quan used his visual ability...

27
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,120
...to lead a prosperous life.

28
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,760
However,soon,...

29
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,040
...the side effects of the Golden Eyes affected his body.

30
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,320
Dear,what's happening?

31
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,360
Get someone here! Dear!

32
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,120
However.....

33
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,040
What's wrong?

34
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,920
Feng Quan lived until 102 years old.

35
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,320
There should be a process of self-help in between,...

36
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,400
...yet it seems to be ruined. -Ruined?

37
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,360
Why would it be ruined?

38
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,680
We came all the way here for the secret of the Golden Eyes.

39
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,200
Xiao Rui,don't worry. Things will be fine. You'll be fine.

40
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,520
Like the eternity of the moon, the rise of the sun,...

41
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,810
...the fall of the River of Forgetfulness...

42
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,690
...and the Golden Eyes.

43
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,920
Ones,tens, hundreds,thousands,...

44
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,520
...tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands!

45
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,920
Xiao Rui,we will be rich from now on!

46
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,120
Look!

47
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,640
This is the place the rich live!

48
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,920
Surprise!

49
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,640
China Jade Association membership card?

50
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,170
In the future,my pension shall depend on you.

51
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,000
Uncle Gu. Uncle Gu!

52
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,770
I always thought that after getting the Golden Eyes,...

53
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,850
...I became the one and only unique existence in this world.

54
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,120
I was arrogant.

55
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,320
The secret of the Golden Eyes comes from...

56
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,570
...the energy of beryllium contained in the jade...

57
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,240
...and the stimulation of electric shock.

58
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,720
What I received...

59
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,400
... was some of the residual copper energy...

60
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,800
...in the jade...

61
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,820
...and some weak current.

62
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,080
Meanwhile,Feng Quan personally experienced the meteorite hit...

63
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,960
...and the lightning shock.

64
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,040
His Golden Eyes...

65
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,700
...were 1,000 times stronger than mine.

66
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,920
His visual ability...

67
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,210
...must have broken through the multi-dimensions.

68
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,700
It's beyond our imagination.

69
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,280
If Feng Quan...

70
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,280
...was such a great person,...

71
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,480
...why wasn't he mentioned at all in history?

72
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,240
Was it really good...

73
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:12,800
...to be able to see through everything?

74
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,730
I don't know how Feng Quan faced this during his time.

75
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,140
However,I believe...

76
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,960
...that he had the same thought as mine.

77
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,960
It would be great...

78
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,400
...if we never had the Golden Eyes.

79
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,610
All right,let's not talk about this. We need to go out first.

80
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,490
The route we used to enter here is obstructed.

81
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,440
Follow me.

82
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,400
I found this tunnel just now.

83
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,210
This should be the exit.

84
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:05,130
Let's go!

85
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,120
Xiao Yun and Feifei, are you all right?

86
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,720
Hello.

87
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,320
Mr. Nakagawa.

88
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,960
Mr. Zhuang,it's Mr. Nakagawa.

89
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,120
Hello. -Zhuang Rui,are you okay?

90
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,400
I'm fine,thanks.

91
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,040
Have you found a way to solve the side effects of the Golden Eyes?

92
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,840
In Feng Quan Tomb,on the inner wall of the coffin,...

93
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,880
...I saw some paintings...

94
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,040
...recording what happened to Feng Quan while he was alive,...

95
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,040
...but the part on how to solve this was ruined.

96
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,600
Besides,we saw some corpses inside the tomb.

97
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,920
My father's diary stated that...

98
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,560
...after they left Feng Quan Tomb,...

99
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,160
...the survivors created the Guardian's Monument,...

100
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,760
...a cenotaph for the dead team members.

101
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,320
Maybe there will be some clues there.

102
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,320
If the Guardian's Monument is close to Feng Quan Tomb,...

103
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,840
...it should be around here. We can look for it.

104
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,440
Okay. However,I need Qingshan and Xiao Dao here...

105
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,370
...to help me to settle something.

106
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,080
Do you still need me to send anyone to help you?

107
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,700
No. The four of us will be fine.

108
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,640
It's just that...

109
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,760
...I need a favour from you.

110
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,440
Do you still remember Qin Xuanbing?

111
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,160
When the cave collapsed,...

112
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,080
...she was buried inside. I'm afraid she's already.....

113
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,120
We need time to look for the Guardian's Monument.

114
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,960
If it's possible,...

115
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,960
...please send some people to search for her.

116
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,720
After all,she went into the cave with us.

117
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,640
I don't want her to stay there. -Okay.

118
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,160
Thank you.

119
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:45,520
Thanks a lot for the help.

120
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,240
Thanks to you, we didn't die in Gobi.

121
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,760
It's our responsibility to protect you all.

122
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,440
Peng Fei.

123
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,640
Zhuang Rui and Huangfu Yun.

124
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,520
Come here! I have things to discuss with you.

125
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,980
Wait,let's talk later. -What's the matter?

126
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,280
You will encounter many problems along the way.

127
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,760
You must take good care of yourself.

128
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,320
Both of you should be careful when you go back.

129
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,480
Watch out for the Qin family.

130
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,460
I'll be going then.

131
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,320
Xiao Dao.

132
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,560
I.....

133
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,640
I.....

134
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,520
Have a safe journey. Take care.

135
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,440
You,too.

136
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,000
Goodbye.

137
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,560
I didn't know you could take it. -I'm used to it.

138
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,720
Me,too.

139
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,160
Are you thinking about Xiao Dao? -No.

140
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,520
It's okay. You're a man. Just admit it.

141
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,600
Once this is settled and Xiao Rui recovers,...

142
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,760
...I'll accompany you to Japan. By then,I'll ask Ms. Xiao Jia...

143
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,560
...to come up with a romantic solution for you.

144
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,120
Then you will be able to win Xiao Dao's heart.

145
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,640
Xiao Yun,do you think...

146
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,960
...Xiao Rui will recover? -He has to! He will!

147
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,240
Feng Quan,who existed 2,000 years ago,was fine. Why wouldn't he be?

148
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,050
You must have faith in Xiao Rui.

149
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,400
You're right. No matter how it turns out,...

150
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,720
...we cannot give up.

151
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,120
You're crazy.

152
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,880
Thanks,I'll cherish it.

153
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,440
I study jewellery design. -You mean diamond?

154
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,360
Yes,on top of jade and jadeite.

155
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,810
It's a house-warming present. Do you like it?

156
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,840
Eat them. I selected these carefully.

157
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,200
There isn't a bad one.

158
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,480
You have sharp eyes.

159
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,760
Can we go back to the way we were?

160
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,920
Zhuang Rui,...

161
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,480
...sometimes I think it'd be great if I had stayed with you.

162
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,730
If not because of me,...

163
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,060
...Qin Xuanbing would not have died.

164
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,780
I caused her death.

165
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,800
You didn't.

166
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,300
Qin Haoran was the cause of her death.

167
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,680
Do you still remember why she first came to Beijing?

168
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,220
She went there to plan the pawn shop robbery.

169
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,320
From that moment,...

170
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,440
...no,let's put it this way,...

171
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,120
...since she was adopted by Qin Haoran,...

172
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,540
..she was fated to go down a path where there's no turning back.

173
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,020
Qin Xuanbing was not a bad person.

174
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,580
She was different from the Qin family's followers.

175
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,880
She was cheated by Qin Haoran...

176
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,580
...and did so much for him.

177
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,040
I think she must be upset,too.

178
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,680
Let's put it this way.

179
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,400
She is free now.

180
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,720
She no longer has to struggle between conscience,...

181
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,320
...her love for her adopted father and you.

182
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,120
If there's another life,...

183
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,490
...I hope she will be born into a normal family...

184
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,100
...and lead a normal life,...

185
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,040
...where everything is simple and she won't have to scheme...

186
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,490
...nor harm anyone.

187
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,400
Then she'll get to enjoy...

188
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,930
...the small but happy things in life.

189
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,600
How was it?

190
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,600
Are you sure? Did you see it with your own eyes?

191
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,760
Have you verified it?

192
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,840
Noted.

193
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,600
Father,your leg hurts again. I'll get a heating pack for you.

194
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,920
Wake up. Pack your things. We still have to rush.

195
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,200
Where are we going? -To the Guardian's Monument.

196
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,840
Come again?

197
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,240
We're going to the Guardian's Monument.

198
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,480
The desert is vast. How are we going to find it?

199
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,680
Do you know the place?

200
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:37,850
Xiao Rui,...

201
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,100
...do you know where it is?

202
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,360
Let me think.

203
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,840
Father,who is this person?

204
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,840
This is your grandfather.

205
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,860
Your name was given by your grandfather.

206
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,880
What's grandfather's name? What did he do?

207
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,760
He was an archaeologist. His name was Zhuang Qiming.

208
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,040
Zhuang Qiming?

209
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,320
Your grandfather was born early in the morning.

210
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,080
In early morning,only the Venus is particularly bright.

211
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,240
Hence,his father named him Zhuang Qiming.

212
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,320
Your grandfather said that Venus was his lucky star...

213
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,920


214
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,320


215
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,200
...and would bring good luck to him.

216
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,200


217
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,800
I want that,too. -Sure.

218
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,760


219
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,280


220
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,800


221
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,800
Venus will also bring good luck to our Xiao Rui.

222
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,280


223
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,800


224
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,000
I think I know something. -What is it?

225
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,360


226
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,000


227
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,200
My grandfather Zhuang Qiming said that Venus was his lucky star.

228
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,840


229
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,200


230
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,240
When he left Feng Quan Tomb and came here,...

231
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,600


232
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,240


233
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,680
...if I was not mistaken, I think he would follow...

234
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,080


235
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,680


236
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,600
...the direction where Venus rises.

237
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,600
