00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,500
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,500
Episode 22

3
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,720
Shut the doors. No one is allowed to leave.

4
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,729
Young man,you stay right here.

5
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,650
Shut the doors. No one is allowed to leave.

6
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,380
No one is allowed to leave.

7
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,079
Go over there.

8
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:27,200
Take them away! -Don't move!

9
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,370
That's a C-4 explosive.

10
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,480
It will blow this place up.

11
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,079
Tell your men not to do anything.

12
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,720
Feifei,do you think they realised that I have escaped?

13
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,320
What should we do? -You have a mask on...

14
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,760
...but they might recognise you. Why don't you...

15
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,960
...finish the act with Zhuang Rui and find a way to escape?

16
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,120
What about you? -Don't worry. I'll find a way.

17
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,000
Go.

18
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,240
Don't move!

19
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,640
Mother.

20
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,460
Don't turn around.

21
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,440
Over here! Hurry! -Let's go.

22
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,040
Hurry.

23
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,120
Get in the car.

24
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,320
Feifei,get in the car! -Hurry!

25
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,760
Go! I can handle it here!

26
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,810
Let's go! -Let's go!

27
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,530
Don't be afraid. Come with you.

28
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,400
That is Hu Rong's man who ruined our plan.

29
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,440
Go after him! -Let's go!

30
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,440
What about Feifei? -She can handle it.

31
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,040
What about Xiaorui? -He's still inside.

32
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,120
If Xiaorui hadn't reminded us to not do anything,...

33
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,400
...I would've rushed in right away.

34
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,080
We've already been exposed. If we go back,...

35
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,840
...it will ruin Xiaorui's plan.

36
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,100
Bo Gang doesn't know Xiaorui.

37
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,040
With all the chaos, he will not be noticed.

38
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,220
They can find a way to slip out.

39
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,480
No,someone will recognize him. There's Old Zhou.

40
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,880
Follow that car!

41
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,440
Sit tight.

42
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,880
Xiaorui is not picking up his phone.

43
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,640
This can't do.

44
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,360
We have to go back. Wenwen is still inside.

45
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,020
Boss,we can't do that.

46
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,420
Bo Gang will tighten the security. It's too dangerous.

47
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,400
Xiaorui's car is on the move. -Where is he?

48
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,840
They have left the place.

49
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,560
Move aside!

50
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,200
Move aside!

51
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,640
Are you all right?

52
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,280
I'm fine. We got away for now.

53
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,720
Okay,I have a plan.

54
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,080
They ran away.

55
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,520
The man is injured.

56
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,240
He can't have gotten far. Split up and get him!

57
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,240
Let's go!

58
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,640
No,this can't do.

59
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,400
Let's do this. You run along this path and don't look back.

60
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,690
I'll distract them.

61
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,320
No,we'll go together. I can't leave you here like this.

62
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,440
No,it's too risky. We need to split up in order to survive.

63
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,760
Don't worry. They won't find me for now.

64
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,000
I'll hang in there until you bring help.

65
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,050
You must wait for me.

66
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,360
Be careful.

67
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,640
They can't be far. Search thoroughly.

68
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,690
You can't find them?

69
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,620
Didn't they manage to escape?

70
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,850
I've searched the nearby areas and only found their car.

71
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,130
However,the car is badly damaged by bullets.

72
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,880
There is also blood stains inside.

73
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,880
Who's injured? What happened?

74
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,810
Could they be captured?

75
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,360
It's impossible. Kun Sha and his men...

76
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,280
...are still searching the area. He's not caught yet.

77
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,280
Send more men. -Yes.

78
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,010
However,...

79
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,680
...don't go head on with those good-for-nothing men.

80
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,080
Let's focus on our search. Don't create more trouble.

81
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,560
Boss Hu,it's a critical moment. Are we just going to search?

82
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,680
They could be waiting for us to rescue them.

83
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,200
If Kun Sha finds them, Xiaorui will be dead.

84
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,840
No,I must save them. -I'll go with you.

85
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,880
Wait.

86
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,840
Send all our men there.

87
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,160
These men need to see blood before they behave.

88
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,800
I am not called Madam Hu for nothing.

89
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,040
Mother. -Miss.

90
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,440
Mother. -Wenwen.

91
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,880
You're back. Are you all right? Did they do anything to you?

92
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,640
No. -Miss Hu,where's Zhuang Rui?

93
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,640
Wasn't he with you? -Zhuang Rui.

94
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,080
Mother,you have to save Zhuang Rui.

95
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,400
There's no rush. Sit down and have a rest.

96
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,040
Let me look at you.

97
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,120
Miss Hu,where is Zhuang Rui?

98
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,480
Feifei distracted the guards so Zhuang Rui and I could escape.

99
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
However,Kun Sha wouldn't let us go...

100
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,600
...and kept coming after us.

101
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,080
Zhuang Rui and I were hiding at first...

102
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,880
...but he asked me to come back and get help.

103
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,210
He stayed behind to distract the group of men.

104
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,320
How was he? Did he get injured?

105
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,250
I'm not too sure.

106
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,280
I don't think so. I just kept running.

107
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,640
I'm sorry.

108
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,880
Seeing that you are not injured,...

109
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,040
...the blood stains in the car must be his.

110
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,960
Zhuang Rui is injured? Why did he.....

111
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,080
He was shot and didn't want to trouble you...

112
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,920
...so he stayed back to distract the group of men.

113
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,740
What about himself? Is he going to die there?

114
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,200
That was the best thing to do in that situation.

115
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,560
You! -I'm sorry,it was my fault.

116
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,320
If I knew that he was injured,...

117
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,280
...I wouldn't have left him there.

118
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,840
Mother,please send... ...some men to save him.

119
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,480
Yes,you are familiar with the area.

120
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,440
Just tell us the location and we'll go there.

121
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,880
There's no rush. Let us have a seat.

122
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,160
I know how you feel but please calm down...

123
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,560
...and think of a plan.

124
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,480
Aunt Hu,we missed the golden hour for rescue.

125
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,760
I'm asking you to give us some of your men for the rescue.

126
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,040
Mother!

127
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,240
Fine,since you are not willing to help us,...

128
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,360
...we'll do it on our own.

129
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,440
What is this? -I'm sorry.

130
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,640
Before he left,Zhuang Rui made me promise your safety.

131
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,080
I cannot let you go on a suicide mission.

132
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,120
Zhuang Rui is a dying man.

133
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,690
His words don't matter now.

134
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,760
I'm sorry but I have to keep you under house arrest.

135
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,120
How is it? -There's no reception.

136
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,440
What are you doing? -Lower your voice.

137
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,560
How dare they treat their benefactors like this?

138
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,440
Xiaorui is in danger and we don't know where Feifei is.

139
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,640
There's nothing we can do here.

140
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,320
Hu Rong was anxious earlier as her daughter was in danger.

141
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,360
Now that her daughter is back,...

142
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,290
...there is no need for her to burn bridges with them.

143
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,760
We have to do something. -Of course we do.

144
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:54,860
Let's do it!

145
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,920
Xiaoyun,what are you doing? Come here! He's dying!

146
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,320
Send him to the hospital. If anything happens,...

147
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,920
...you will be in trouble. Hurry up!

148
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,760
Are you all right? -I can't take this anymore!

149
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,290
Hurry up!

150
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,530
Let's go.

151
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,120
Miss Hu,don't tell me you're stopping us?

152
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,280
Xiaofei is a skilled fighter so you better move aside.

153
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,080
I don't plan to stop you.

154
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,260
I just didn't think that you would escape this soon.

155
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,600
Take these...

156
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,410
...to protect yourselves.

157
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,520
Why didn't we take the two guns earlier?

158
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,420
You should have prepared guns for us!

159
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,400
These were already difficult to get.

160
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,240
I knew I can't rely on rich people like you.

161
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,360
Let's go. What is it?

162
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,560
This has Zhuang Rui's location.

163
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,250
I've written clearly on it.

164
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,760
I will get my mother to send reinforcement.

165
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,200
Please bring Zhuang Rui back safely.

166
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,680
Of course. -Thank you.

167
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,120
Leader Er,you have to pay attention...

168
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,600
...on every aspect.

169
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,200
Father. -I will.

170
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,520
Why did you rush down here?

171
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,200
I heard that Hu Rong's manor has some troubles.

172
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,680
Zhuang Rui and the rest are being chased by Bo Gang.

173
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,010
I think we should send our men to investigate.

174
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,800
Yes,sir.

175
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,400
Have a seat.

176
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,120
Drink some tea.

177
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,240
These are gifted from Hu Rong. It tastes good.

178
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,880
Father.

179
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,120
Hu Rong will settle the trouble in her own home.

180
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,920
She is not called Madam Hu for nothing.

181
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,480
Let's not get involved in this.

182
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,800
Father,Hu family is not doing anything about it.

183
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,680
I believe that Zhuang Rui is not Bo Gang's match.

184
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,640
He will die.

185
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,320
The Heavens will decide Zhuang Rui's destiny.

186
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,960
Besides,he's smart,...

187
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,160
...so he will not die easily.

188
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:13,800
On the other hand,look at you.

189
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,540
You are not like yourself.

190
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,080
Forgive me,father. It's just that Bo Gang is a petty...

191
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,520
...ruthless man.

192
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,480
Even the Hu family dare not offend him this time.

193
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,560
Father,I'm worried that if Zhuang Rui dies like this,...

194
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,370
...our plan will be ruined.

195
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,400
Xuanbing,...

196
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,040
...I know that you value relationships.

197
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:48,320
However,emotions will impair our judgements...

198
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,240
...and forget who we are.

199
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,540
You must learn to control your emotions.

200
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,160
That was the first thing I taught you.

201
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,690
Did you forget that?

202
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,760
Of course not. I'm sorry for making you worry.

203
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,890
You're my daughter. Of course I will worry about you.

204
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,480
However,I'm sure you won't let me down.

205
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,240
I trust you. -Yes,father.

206
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,320
If there's nothing else,...

207
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,500
...I'll leave now.

208
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,280
All right.

209
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,640
Sir.

210
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:42,920
A'Gui.

211
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,520
I'm worried about her.

212
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,180
Pay more attention to her but don't let her find out.

213
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,360
Yes,sir. I'll leave now.

214
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,000
All right.

215
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,120
Boss,can you sell it to me?

216
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,100
I'm sorry but this young man has already paid for it.

217
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,410
I notice that you like the cricket.

218
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,680
Why don't I give it to you?

219
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,160
Did you make it yourself?

220
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,140
A cricket only lives around 100 days.

221
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,440
It has a short life and won't survive the winter solstice.

222
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,370
However,the happiness that it brings...

223
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,420
...remains even after its death.

224
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,280
What do we do? It's wet. -It's okay. I'm wearing all black.

225
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,480
It's all right but your pants are white.

226
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,280
You wouldn't want it to stain.

227
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,720
Have some. I picked them out for you.

228
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,760
They're all ripe.

229
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,560
You will have a bitter taste after the anaesthetic shot...

230
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,120
...so I got you these fruits.

231
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:34,200
You will get drunk on this easily...

232
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,210
...so I'll drink it for you.

233
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,480
I'll drink it for her.

234
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,320
He's badly injured. -He won't make it.

235
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,200
We'll bury him in the same place.

236
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:23,960
Zhuang Rui!

237
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,240
I'm sorry.

238
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,120
You're up. Are you feeling better?

239
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,360
Did you save me? -You passed out in the forest...

240
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,600
...so I carried you here. What were you doing there?

241
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,000
I got lost in the forest and fainted after falling.

242
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,410
It is indeed easy to get lost in the forest.

243
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,120
Who is this?

244
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:03,000
All of us mine for a living. Accidents like this are normal.

245
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,880
The reception here is weak.

246
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,680
Why don't you stay here for a few days...

247
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,360
...and then decide what to do.

248
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,200
Thank you. -Don't mention it.

249
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,880
Xiaowu,take his body away. -Let's go.

250
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,680
Let's go.

251
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,240
Zhuang Rui!

252
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,800
Zhuang Rui! I thought I wouldn't see you again.

253
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,560
Zhuang Rui.

254
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,280
Who are you? Where is this?

255
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,050
Zhuang Rui, what's wrong with you?

256
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,720
Zhuang Rui,I'm Feifei.

257
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,320
What did you say? -I'm Feifei.

258
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,760
What's wrong with you?

259
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,920
Feifei?

260
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,300
What's wrong with you?

261
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,400
My head hurts.

262
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:35,920
Zhuang Rui.

263
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,220
Zhuang Rui.

264
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,570
Xiaoyun.

265
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,600
Could it be Zhuang Rui's blood?

266
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,020
It's possible.

267
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,080
Is his life in danger?

268
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,460
There wasn't much blood so it won't kill him.

269
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,610
However,looking at the dried up blood stain,...

270
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,680
...he must have left a long time ago.

271
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,840
Does it mean he has escaped or is he captured?

272
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,960
If he had been captured, we would hear from Bo Gang.

273
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,840
He is safe for now but we need to find him quick.

274
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,600
Although he did not bleed much, if we don't stop the blood,...

275
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,500
...he might not be able to make it.

276
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:02,890
That way.

277
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,320
You're finally awake. How are you feeling?

278
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,410
Have some water.

279
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,440
Who are you?

280
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,040
Your leg was inflamed which led to your fever.

281
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,440
We need to go to the hospital.

282
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,610
You should have some rest before we get moving. Drink up.

283
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,040
Thank you.

284
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,340
Zhuang Rui!

285
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,260
Did the fever affect your brain? This is not time for a joke.

286
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:13,120
A joke? I'm not joking. Who are you?

287
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:22,720
You.....

288
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,000
You don't remember me at all?

289
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,280
Do we know each other?

290
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,560
Have a bite. This apple is not rotten this time.

291
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,940
Do you remember anything?

292
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,090
Do you really...

293
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,150
...not remember anything?

294
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,450
I remember everything.

295
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,320
We fell into the trap room together.

296
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,640
Sand started pouring in.

297
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,520
I was anxious...

298
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,960
...because of my claustrophobia.

299
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,480
Officer Miao,please calm down.

300
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,600
You saved me.

301
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,160
I didn't even get the chance to thank you.

302
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,440
However,you don't even remember it now.

303
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,780
Maybe it's for the better.

304
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,040
Besides that,...

305
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,440
...at the ball in Kiev,...

306
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,000
...I wanted to tell you.

307
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:42,040
May I have a dance with you?

308
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,620
From now on,...

309
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,400
...please don't dance in front of other women.

310
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,840
They will go crazy over you.

311
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,340
I also remember...

312
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,720
...that the moon was beautiful and round that night.

313
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,840
You must not remember any of that.

314
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,820
It's all right.

315
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:11,920
Don't worry.

316
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,490
I will take you back to Beijing,...

317
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,320
...to Siheyuan...

318
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,650
...and to your Ruiyunzhai.

319
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,000
I promise you that.

320
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,600
These are common stones. Did all of you slack off?

321
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,400
Village head,we tried our best.

322
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,680
There are deaths whenever we enter the mountain every year.

323
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,480
Our manpower and tools are limited so these are good enough.

324
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,160
If we don't have the materials, they will not let us off easily.

325
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,240


326
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,160


327
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,280
The entire village will be in trouble then.

328
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:50,640


329
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,280


330
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,800
What about the man I asked you to find?

331
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,800


332
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,200
We have another death today.

333
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,200


334
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,920
We found a man and a woman yesterday.

335
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,880


336
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,920


337
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,840
I think they know each other.

338
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,840


339
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,320
The man seemed to be injured but he'll be fine soon.

340
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,600


341
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,320


342
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,640
Outsiders are better.

343
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,640


344
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,440
If they die, no one will suspect anything.

345
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,440
