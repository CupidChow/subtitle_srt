1
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,000
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 34

3
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,960
Miss Xiaojia.

4
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,320
Look at the stars.

5
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:51,440
Look at the moon. It's beautiful!

6
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,960
I'm willing to fly to the sky with you.

7
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,039
With this ambience,...

8
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,760
...I'd like to dedicate a song to you.

9
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,240
I want to be...

10
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,920
...the only one in your eyes.

11
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,360
Even if I am rejected by the world...

12
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,440
...every day.

13
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,160
I want to be the only one in your heart.

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,320
Even if I am rejected by the world...

15
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,160
...every day.

16
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,320
I want to be...

17
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,480
...the only one in your heart.

18
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,040
I don't remember the lyrics. -Zhuang Rui.

19
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,900
I don't remember what comes next.

20
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,920
Zhuang Rui.

21
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,050
You two stop drinking. You can't hold your drink.

22
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,400
I can hold my drink. What are you saying?

23
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,800
Feifei.

24
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,400
Feifei,come here. -Why are you.....

25
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,880
Come here,Feifei. -It's an original song.

26
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,640
You're drunk. Come,let's go back.

27
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,100
Zhuang Rui. -What's with Zhuang Rui?

28
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,160
Zhuang Rui left. -Where did he go?

29
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,720
Come,let's go back in. -Qin Xuanbing.

30
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,640
Qin Xuanbing again.

31
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,560
Qin Xuanbing again.

32
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,640
Let's go back in. -Let's look at the moon.

33
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,520
Look at the moon.

34
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,480
Are you all right? -I'm all right.

35
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,760
I need your help. -Why?

36
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,520
I need your eyes. -Why did you lie to me?

37
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,700
I didn't lie to you.

38
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,810
The Xu family at the Pingzhou auction,...

39
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,450
...Kachin Hills at Phakant...

40
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,159
...and No. 1 tomb at Inner Mongolia.

41
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,720
Did you plan all these?

42
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,320
Did you?

43
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,040
Our first encounter.

44
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,000
At Sanheliu,...

45
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,740
...did you plan that,too?

46
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,200
No,that wasn't planned.

47
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,920
I've never doubted you. I've always trusted you.

48
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,100
What about now?

49
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,000
Now?

50
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,920
If you explain everything to me now,...

51
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,330
...I'll still believe you.

52
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,820
If you are in a bind,...

53
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,720
...I can understand.

54
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:50,980
Zhuang Rui.

55
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,740
I've never make use of you to hurt anyone.

56
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,490
No matter what happened during this time,...

57
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,520
...I did my best to protect you.

58
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,480
I was with you...

59
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,380
...at the most dangerous situations,wasn't I?

60
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,080
To be honest,...

61
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,640
...I don't like backstabbing in business.

62
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,370
However,what choice do I have?

63
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,890
I did not choose to be where I am.

64
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,409
Business is business, I know that.

65
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,120
However,can there be no deceit?

66
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,520
Can we treat each other with sincerity?

67
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,680
Sincerity? That's a selfish request.

68
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,940
Sometimes,...

69
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,080
...things get easier when you do it another way.

70
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,040
No matter what you say, I can't tolerate being deceived.

71
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,690
What makes you think that I can?

72
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,160
I remember the times when we just met.

73
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,800
It was a good time.

74
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,250
Even when I was laying on the hospital bed,...

75
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,960
...I felt good.

76
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,000
There was no selfishness involved. No deception.

77
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,700
Why did you call me out?

78
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,720
I need your help.

79
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,409
I only help friends.

80
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,280
Fine.

81
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,680
How about we make a deal?

82
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,560
I'm not interested in making deals.

83
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,360
What about The Life of Feng book?

84
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,810
Aren't you interested in that?

85
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,360
The one you have is only the first part.

86
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,740
The second part is with me.

87
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,160
The secret of the Golden Eyes is within.

88
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,180
You know about the Golden Eye?

89
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,480
I know...

90
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,120
...what you don't.

91
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,440
What else do you know?

92
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,080
So,...

93
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,090
...do we have a deal?

94
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,410
What do you want?

95
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,600
If you help me,...

96
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,570
...I will give you the second part of The Life of Feng.

97
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,200
We'll meet at the airport tomorrow,at noon.

98
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,560
Don't worry, no one will be injured.

99
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,020
Zhuang Rui.

100
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,360
Can we go back to the way things were?

101
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,040
Feifei.

102
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,260
The candle has burned all the way down...

103
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,020
...yet you just returned.

104
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,100
I had matters to attend to.

105
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,480
Did you meet Qin Xuanbing?

106
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:44,840
Yes.

107
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,880
What did she want?

108
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,560
She wants me to go to Yunnan with her.

109
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,880
Did you agree?

110
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,080
Yes.

111
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,360
Feifei.

112
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,600
I have my reasons.

113
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,800
Do as you wish.

114
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,800
Even after everyone has left, Feifei waited for you.

115
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,120
Grandfather Gu. -Wait,you're not well yet.

116
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,650
Where are you flying off to?

117
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,200
Yunnan. I'll be back soon.

118
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,920
No,I'll go with you.

119
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,200
You're not well so why are you moving around?

120
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,290
Grandfather Gu,it's nothing.

121
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,580
That's enough.

122
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,200
She reserved this strawberry cake for you.

123
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,520
Grandfather Gu. -Listen,Feifei is a nice lady.

124
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,500
Why are you smiling like that? The food's gone cold.

125
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,600
It's nothing.

126
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,640
Xiaorui.

127
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,960
Xiaorui,have some porridge. It's gone cold.

128
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,560
Stop calling for him. He's left.

129
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,000
Left? Where did he go?

130
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,680
Get in.

131
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,920
I've listened to you and came to Yunnan.

132
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,170
You don't have to watch over me.

133
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,860
Don't misunderstand.

134
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,080
You came to Yunnan for Qin family. This is what I should do.

135
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,440
You said 2 hours but we've been here for 3 hours.

136
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,080
You have the time but I don't.

137
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,640
I still have more to shop.

138
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,680
I don't have time. I need to pack my suitcase.

139
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,600
Where are you going?

140
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,720
Yunnan. -Yunnan?

141
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,840
Zhuang Rui has just left and you are going after him already.

142
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,320
Can't you be more restrained?

143
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,080
Have you forgotten he left in the middle of your party?

144
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,320
He kept you waiting all night. Aren't you angry?

145
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,800
I'm angry. -Then why would you follow him?

146
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,040
Can't I go to Yunnan just because I'm angry?

147
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,280
Besides,I'm not going to Yunnan for him.

148
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,960
Forget it. Do you think I don't know?

149
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,240
Listen here, you can't be unrestrained.

150
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,240
You should...

151
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,760
...hold your head up high and let him come to you.

152
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,900
If you don't,he will keep repeating this bad habit.

153
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,240
However,this might do,too.

154
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,320
You should appear him in front of him to attract his attention.

155
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,360
He will feel guilty each time he sees you...

156
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,000
...and will think of ways to make it up to you.

157
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,000
Remember,don't forgive him easily,understand?

158
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,600
Is the lesson over, teacher Xiaojia?

159
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm leaving.

160
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,760
One more thing.

161
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,640
Are you really leaving me here?

162
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,480
Are you in such a rush?

163
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,480
The barista here is from Bar Hemingway in Paris.

164
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,480
Have a taste.

165
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,680
I've no interest in wine tasting. Tell me,what's your plan?

166
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,829
Shill bidding.

167
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,020
Shill bidding?

168
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,680
Yes. We have a fairly good stone.

169
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,580
We need your position in the Gem Association...

170
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,530
...to increase the bidding price.

171
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,480
I told you, I won't do anything illegal.

172
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,360
I know. I won't ask you to do anything illegal,too.

173
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,970
My father has consulted an expert.

174
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,440
This stone is a good stone.

175
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,040
I'm sure you can tell just by looking at it.

176
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,720
The market isn't doing too well.

177
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,300
Something worth billions is only priced at RMB 60 million.

178
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,360
So we need your eyes to increase the price of the stone...

179
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,920
...at the jade forum.

180
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,210
When the auction starts, you'll place a high bid.

181
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,560
Then I'll hand it over to you to bid higher.

182
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,160
You're artificially increasing the price.

183
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,690
You're indeed a professional.

184
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,560
I will give you what you want...

185
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,160
...after the jade forum.

186
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,840
Mr. Nakagawa,he's here.

187
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,040
I know.

188
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,420
Yes,my plane has just landed.

189
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,760
Report to me when if there's any updates.

190
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,840
I'll watch Qin Xuanbing.

191
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,120
I don't know but I hope I'll get something.

192
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:33,800
It's like this. There'll be 68 exhibition items.

193
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,480
There's a mistake, it's not 66 items.

194
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,160
Besides,there must be emotions in the exhibition this time.

195
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,240
You must emphasize that the predecessor of silk...

196
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,440
...is jade stone. Make sure everything's in place.

197
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,440
That's all for now. All right.

198
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,130
Grandfather,why are you staring at me like that?

199
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,560
Did I say anything wrong?

200
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,480
No,you did well.

201
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,080
I thought you were going to criticise me.

202
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,700
I've been criticising you since you were young.

203
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,040
You have finally become independent.

204
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,560
Good.

205
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,680
Time flies.

206
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,170
It looks like I've found my successor.

207
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,280
Of course. I may not be as talented as Xiaorui...

208
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,000
...but whose's grandson am I?

209
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,680
How terrible can I be?

210
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,440
Yes,the old must give way to the young.

211
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,880
I'm about to fall off now. -What are you saying?

212
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,320
You're full of vigour...

213
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,680
...can criticise me until you're 100 years old.

214
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,240
No,I will not criticise you again.

215
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,200
You've grown into an eagle.

216
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,720
It's time for me to let go.

217
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,680
Grandfather,from now on, you can enjoy hobbies...

218
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,200
...like playing against schoolchildren. Leave work to me.

219
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,530
There won't be problem.

220
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,280
Yes,with you and Xiaorui, I'm not worried at all.

221
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,720
I'm only waiting for grandchildren.

222
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,560
Yes,you two must grab the chance...

223
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,840
...and give me grandchildren while I'm still alive.

224
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,920
Grandfather,that'd be difficult.

225
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,560
Why don't you introduce a girl to me?

226
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,320
I can't help you on this.

227
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,920
I know that you still like Feifei,right?

228
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,240
To be honest,you're no match against Xiaorui.

229
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,460
Grandfather,I know that.

230
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,360
Actually,I've realised that Feifei really likes Xiaorui.

231
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,560
I had a hard time accepting that.

232
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,200
However,I get it now.

233
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,680
Feifei's happiness is more important.

234
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,040
At least,I've gained a cheeky,...

235
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,520
...cute and kind sister,right?

236
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,760
Good,I'm glad you feel that way.

237
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,720
You're a grown up now.

238
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,520
Grandfather,not only have I grown up...

239
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,250
...I've become more handsome.

240
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,920
Look. -Yes,more handsome than I am.

241
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,200
Feifei.

242
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,800
She must have heard us. -I'll take this call.

243
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:41,960
Feifei.

244
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,320
Where are you?

245
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,400
I'm in Yunnan.

246
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,000
I know that. Which part of Yunnan?

247
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,660
I'm at the auction.

248
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,480
I knew it. Send me your location, I'm going there.

249
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,960
You're coming to Yunnan?

250
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,500
Are you looking for me?

251
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,020
Grandfather Gu. -Feifei.

252
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,400
Have a seat.

253
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,360
Feifei,what brings you to Yunnan?

254
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,420
Are you looking for me or Xiaorui?

255
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,320
Who's looking for him?

256
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,560
So you're looking for me?

257
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,560
I'm not looking for anyone. I'm taking a break.

258
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,400
Is it? Officer Miao is a busy woman.

259
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,600
When do you have the time for a break?

260
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:07,360
I'm taking a break as I've been too busy,all right?

261
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,800
Yes but why must you take a break in Yunnan?

262
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,370
Who cares if it's Yunnan or Hainan?

263
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,680
Whether it's Yunnan or Vietnam,...

264
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,120
...I'll go anywhere I wish.

265
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,850
Besides,...

266
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,800
...isn't Grandfather Gu here,too?

267
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,520
Yes.

268
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,360
Fine. You can go anywhere you want.

269
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,000
Yunnan has a great view and beautiful weather.

270
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,800
We're glad that you're here. Am I right,grandfather?

271
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,720
Yes.

272
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,600
Have you seen Qin Xuanbing?

273
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,040
Qin Xuanbing? Xiaorui was with her.

274
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,560
They must be talking business.

275
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,600
What is it? Are you jealous?

276
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,120
Who's jealous?

277
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,480
Grandfather,let's play a game. -Anytime.

278
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,640
Come on! -Let's!

279
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,720
Your friend is here, I'll leave now.

280
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,240
See you at the auction. -No,stay here.

281
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,360
Let's go. Come on!

282
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,400
Xiaorui.

283
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,880
Feifei,why didn't you tell that you're here?

284
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,330
Why would I do that? You have no time for me anyway.

285
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,820
Why would you say that?

286
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,000
Why does it feel like you're angry?

287
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,490
What would I be angry about?

288
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,960
Hold on,why does it feel tense here?

289
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,280
Weren't you celebrating her birthday last night?

290
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,810
Yes,we celebrated my birthday last night...

291
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,650
...but not with him.

292
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,040
He's a busy man.

293
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,360
Are you angry because I left in the middle of it?

294
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,240
There's no such thing. I'm not the boss of you.

295
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,000
Zhuang Rui, you're at fault this time.

296
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,680
Feifei only celebrates her birthday once a year.

297
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,520
You left just like that. Who wouldn't be angry?

298
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,040
Wait,I celebrate my birthday once a year,too.

299
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,480
How about this? I'll celebrate your birthday again today.

300
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,340
Don't be angry.

301
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,640
I don't want that.

302
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,160
Zhuang Rui,what was that?

303
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,720
Do you think Feifei's birthday can be celebrated any day?

304
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,400
All right,there's a wine tasting event on the top floor.

305
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,540
I have two tickets.

306
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,860
One for you,one for me.

307
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,960
Zhuang Rui,we were going to go together.

308
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,840
Grandfather Gu will be by himself.

309
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,440
Won't you accompany him?

310
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,320
Feifei.

311
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,080
Well,...

312
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,480
...I've finished the cake you gave me last night.

313
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,360
It was delicious.

314
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,960
If you want some cake, I'll buy one for you.

315
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,580
Let's eat it together.

316
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,160
Who wants your cake?

317
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,520
What will it take for you not to be angry?

318
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,040
I said I'm not angry.

319
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,000
Don't you understand?

320
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,360
The auction is starting. I'll leave now.

321
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,500
See you at the wine tasting event.

322
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,800
Zhuang Rui is horrible.

323
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,970
Feifei,don't be angry.

324
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,280
The next auction item is stone No. 007.

325
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,720
Weighing at 15.2 kg, the starting bid is RMB60 million.

326
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,650
Dear buyers, we'll commence the bidding.

327
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,640
RMB65 million.

328
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,000
We have RMB65 million.

329
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,880
RMB68 million. -We have RMB68 million.

330
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,720
RMB70 million. -We have RMB70 million.

331
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,600
When will you start bidding?

332
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,620
RMB1 billion. -We have RMB1 billion.

333
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,690
What is Zhuang Rui.....

334
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:06,120
Zhuang Rui and Qin family is closer than I had expected.

335
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,280
Are there any higher bids?

336
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,280
RMB1.15 billion. -We have RMB1.15 billion.

337
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,240
RMB1.2 billion. -We have RMB1.2 billion.

338
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,560
Did you know? The words on the bamboo slip were fading.

339
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,880
RMB1.5 billion. -We have RMB1.5 billion.

340
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,360
Are there any higher bids? -Such a high bid.

341
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,320
RMB1.5 billion,going once.

342
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,220
RMB1.5 billion,going twice.

343
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,080
RMB1.6 billion. -We have RMB1.6 billion.

344
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,620
Are there any higher bids?

345
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,080
RMB1.8 billion. -We have RMB1.8 billion.

346
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,800
Are there any higher bids?

347
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,960
However,I've gotten someone to fix it.

348
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,680
I have a clear photo of it.

349
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,280
RMB1.8 billion,going once.

350
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,940
RMB1.8 billion,going twice.

351
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,000
RMB1.8 billion,deal!

352
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,760
Congratulations to the winner.

353
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,980
Why didn't you bid higher?

354
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,770
RMB1.8 billion is already triple the amount.

355
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,260
That's enough. There is a limit to greed.

356
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,760
Xuanbing. -Father.

357
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,960
How did it go? -We've tripled it.

358
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,720
Well done.

359
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,700
Zhuang Rui is a real treasure.

360
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,480
I'm going to give him what I promised.

361
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,600
Okay.

362
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,120
Looking at this current situation,...

363
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,760
...let's work with Zhuang Rui.

364
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,120
Must we make use of him again?

365
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,920
Remember,in business, one has no friends.

366
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,360
If you don't wish to be trampled on,make the first move.

367
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,530
This is only temporary. Don't think too much.

368
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,450
Understood.

369
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,560
The price to pay for using him is too high.

370
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,520
Hello,Mr. Zhuang.

371
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,800
You are.....

372
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,880
Nakagawa Ryosuke from Nakagawa Corporation.

373
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,080
I'm also in the jade business.

374
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,000
I've been doing this for 20 years.

375
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,240
You're a veteran. Nice to meet you,I'm Zhuang Rui.

376
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,080
Mr. Zhuang is well known.

377
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:48,200
Before I came to China, I heard about...

378
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,760
...someone who can discern jade in the jade industry.

379
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,760
He strikes it every time and made a mistake.

380
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,920
No,I was just lucky.

381
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,640
Actually,both of us...

382
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,770
...are connected in some ways.

383
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,080
Your achievement today makes me proud.

384
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,480
We'll meet again.

385
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,920
You acted well at the auction.

386
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,080
Thank for helping me to raise the price.

387
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,960
I wasn't acting. I studied the stone.

388
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,670
It's a natural jade with an exquisite and smooth texture.

389
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,280
It should open up red jade.

390
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,320
It's worth exceeds RMB60 million.

391
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,480
I still want to thank you.

392
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,200
I'll give you the thing I'd promise you.

393
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,080
What is it?

394
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,220
It sounds mysterious.

395
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,040
Mr. Gu.

396
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,600
Hello. -Hello.

397
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,800
You are.....

398
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,080
Nakagawa Ryosuke from the Nakagawa Corporation.

399
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,960
I've admired you for long. Being able to greet you...

400
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,240
...is an honour.

401
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:46,040
Pardon me for asking, is Nakagawa Yohei your.....

402
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,720
My father.

403
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:55,160
I didn't expect to meet Nakagawa's successor.

404
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,480
You know my father?

405
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,960
We were'nt only acquaintances.

406
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,800
It seems like you have some connection with my father.

407
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,040
Your father and I were supposed to work together...

408
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:16,280
...on an archaeological work.

409
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,040
However,Zhuang Qiming replaced me instead.

410
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,540
We keep in touch through letters.

411
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,610
The letters and the information back then...

412
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,640
...are still with me.

413
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,460
So that was what happened.

414
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,680
I didn't expect someone else to know about what happened then.

415
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,080
As long as it happened, someone is sure to know.

416
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,680
Why aren't you drinking?

417
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,490
Are you afraid of being mugged when drunk?

418
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,440
Officer Miao is right. Drinking is bad for health.

419
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,200
Feifei,you really came. I thought you'd skip it.

420
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,520
There is alcohol and food here.

421
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,880
How could I miss this?

422
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,700
I think you should drink less.

423
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,460
Have some yogurt drink to help indigestion.

424
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,640
Your body is weak so you should have some.

425
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,560
It's rich in iron and good for your brain...

426
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,560
...and your eyes.

427
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:52,160
Officer Miao,did you come to Yunnan for a case?

428
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,320
Yes,there are people who keeps making trouble.

429
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,840
So troublesome.

430
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,240
Is it a troublesome case?

431
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,050
It's confidential.

432
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,840
Did you find any lead?

433
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,720
I can't tell you anything about the case.

434
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,840
However,a criminal will be caught in the end.

435
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,480
If she creates more trouble,...

436
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,640
...I will not let her off easily.

437
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,740
Officer Miao,you have such a coincidence with Zhuang Rui.

438
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:32,760
Zhuang Rui is here for the auction and you're here for a case.

439
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,800
At least I'm not like you who sticks by his side.

440
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,600
What? Feifei went to Yunnan?

441
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,080
Is she there to get even with you?

442
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,880
Get even? What for?

443
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,280
You made her angry!

444
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,240
This is bad. Xiaorui,...

445
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,440
...you're in danger.

446
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,120
Danger? How can I be in danger?

447
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,850
She's a police officer.

448
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,400
Police officer? Listen,you're lucky...

449
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,080
...if she doesn't open fire on you.

450
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,240
Why would she do that? She was nice to me.

451
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,320
She even worries about me. She asked me to...

452
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,600
...take more iron, zinc and calcium.

453
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,440
This is bad.

454
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,960
The lioness is going to go berserk soon.

455
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,200
Goodness,my poor lamb.

456
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,520
You're walking into the lion's den.

457
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,800
Xiaoyun,I'm hanging up now. I'll be back soon.

458
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,440
Bye.

459
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:52,240
Xiaoyun,who was that? You were loud.

460
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,800
Who's in danger? -Xiaorui!

461
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,120
He's in Yunnan alone. Isn't it dangerous?

462
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,050
What danger is he in? I'll help him.

463
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,720
It's not that. He met with Feifei.

464
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,320
Dear Xiaorui, I can only pray for you.

465
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,400
Have a pear to relax.

466
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,600
It's too huge. Cut it for me.

467
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,680
You can't separate pears.

468
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,210
What a romantic.

469
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,840
Zhuang Rui,the lucky draw for VIP will begin soon.

470
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,920
They invited us there. Let's go.

471
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,770
I'm not going. You can go yourself.

472
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,000
No. You're a new VIP in the jade forum.

473
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,700
They especially invited you.

474
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,040
I've done my part by coming here.

475
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,930
I've done all you asked for.

476
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,000
I won't attend other events.

477
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,760
You go. Don't keep them waiting.

478
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,480
Feifei,you.....

479
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,440
A grand event like this,...

480
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,120
...it's perfect for you two. You're not going?
