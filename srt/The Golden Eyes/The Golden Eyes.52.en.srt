1
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,500
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,000
Episode 52

3
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,280
Old Ma,you must help me.

4
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,560
We have helped you with many things.

5
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,759
Only you can save me now.

6
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,360
Don't worry,Old Qin.

7
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,480
Why would I not worry about you?

8
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,080
I know how much...

9
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,840
...you have done.

10
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,700
How about this?

11
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,640
Zhuang Rui still has...

12
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,450
...an important thing.

13
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,370
Help me take it from him.

14
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,560
I'll let you go once this is done.

15
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,280
What is it?

16
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,200
Zhuang Qiming's notebook.

17
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,320
Okay.

18
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,650
I'll send people to take it now.

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,520
No.

20
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,920
This is a very special task.

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,720
You must use tricks.

22
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,880
I...

23
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,320
...want you to kidnap a person.

24
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,320
Who?

25
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,720
Uncle De.

26
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,400
Old Ma,...

27
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,490
...I don't understand.

28
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,560
What if you reveal your identity?

29
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,880
No,you're wrong.

30
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,360
This is the best way to protect my identity.

31
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,960
Think about it.

32
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,720
Zhuang Rui respects...

33
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,560
...Uncle De.

34
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,960
He is very close to Uncle De.

35
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,480
To him,Uncle De is not likely to be Old Ma.

36
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:37,120
When you bring Uncle De to him,...

37
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,140
...will he not give you the notes?

38
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,720
What do you think?

39
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,120
Okay.

40
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:45,960
Old Ma,...

41
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,570
...I don't understand.

42
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,159
Aren't you afraid of revealing your identity?

43
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:53,680
No,you're wrong.

44
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,840
This is the best way to protect my identity.

45
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,720
Think about it.

46
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,360
Zhuang Rui respects...

47
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,240
...Uncle De.

48
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,600
He is very close to Uncle De.

49
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:17,120
To him,Uncle De is not likely to be Old Ma.

50
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,800
When you bring Uncle De to him,...

51
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,780
...will he not give you the notes?

52
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,400
What do you think?

53
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,880
This is impossible.

54
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,640
How is this possible?

55
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,700
Where does this recording come from?

56
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,380
I found it in my father,...

57
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,300
...my adoptive father's walking stick.

58
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,480
I think it's his last clue for me.

59
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,200
Could it be that he falsify this?

60
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,660
Why would he want to falsify this?

61
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,680
It's meaningless. If he shared this to accuse Uncle De,...

62
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,610
...it will not help him.

63
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:20,880
No.

64
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,280
Old Ma is always by our side.

65
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,880
This Old Ma is...

66
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,240
...actually Uncle De whom I trust the most.

67
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,840
No. This is ridiculous!

68
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,120
It's impossible.

69
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,020
Zhuang Rui,...

70
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,530
...I understand your feeling.

71
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,640
It's like how I treat a criminal as a father.

72
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,240
Until my father.....

73
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,680
Until Qin Haoran died in front of me,...

74
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,060
...I finally realised it.

75
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,200
However,it was too late.

76
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,810
I don't have the chance to ask him anymore.

77
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,080
Zhuang Rui, you still have the chance.

78
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:35,820
I promised Officer Miao I'll surrender myself.

79
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,300
I have almost finished packing everything.

80
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,440
I'll go to the station tomorrow afternoon.

81
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,760
I'm really...

82
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,900
...going there this time.

83
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,960
There are clues about Old Ma's case.

84
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,680
Where are you? I'm going to find you now.

85
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,780
I'm going to Uncle De's house.

86
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,600
I need to verify something.

87
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,169
Okay,I understand.

88
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,160
Uncle De.

89
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,720
Uncle De.

90
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,680
Uncle De!

91
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,320
Uncle De!

92
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,320
You could be the reincarnation of Feng Quan.

93
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,240
The legend about Feng Quan is true.

94
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360
Feng Quan's supernatural sight...

95
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,200
...is known as the Golden Eyes.

96
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,040
Then,have you found the person called Xiaoma...

97
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,880
...whom you are looking for?

98
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,120
Qin Haoran, you killed Gu Tianfeng!

99
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,580
You don't even want to let Uncle De go.

100
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,770
Gu Tianfeng?

101
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,050
Do you really think that I killed Gu Tianfeng?

102
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,400
Qin Haoran,if you want to hurt Zhuang Rui,...

103
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,480
...you have to kill me first.

104
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,960
Uncle De!

105
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,880
Uncle De?

106
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,580
Uncle De is not at home.

107
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,120
Didn't you say you found clues?

108
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,700
What are the clues?

109
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,800
Do you believe me?

110
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,890
Do you believe that my eyes can really look into everything?

111
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,300
Of course,I do.

112
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,040
Okay. I'll tell you what my eyes see.

113
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,120
I see...

114
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,860
...Uncle De...

115
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,610
...using this knife...

116
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,930
...to kill Grandfather Gu.

117
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,920
You.....

118
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,640
You mean that...

119
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,240
...Uncle De is Old Ma.

120
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,050
Don't think too much first.

121
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,610
I'll bring this knife to the police station to investigate.

122
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,400
No,I'm joking. It's not true.

123
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,160
Recently, the Golden Eyes keep lying to me.

124
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,360
The Golden Eyes are lying to me. It's impossible.

125
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,600
How is it possible?

126
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:45,920
It's impossible.

127
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,200
It's really lying to me.

128
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,240
Calm down first.

129
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,880
Why don't I bring this back to investigate?

130
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,360
I...

131
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,700
...want you to help me to kidnap someone.

132
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,120
Who?

133
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,560
Uncle De.

134
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,480
Old Ma,...

135
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,290
...I don't understand.

136
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,420
What if you reveal your identity?

137
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,240
No,you're wrong.

138
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,520
This is the best way to protect my identity.

139
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,880
Think about it.

140
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,160
Zhuang Rui respects...

141
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,600
...Uncle De.

142
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,040
He is very close to Uncle De.

143
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:56,200
To him,Uncle De is not likely to be Old Ma.

144
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,160
I'll bring this recording back to...

145
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,140
...the police station to verify its authenticity.

146
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,400
Verify?

147
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,780
Everything needs to be verified!

148
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,330
Artifacts need to be verified.

149
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,900
Evidence have to be verified.

150
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,120
Even human characters have to be verified.

151
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,160
Why is nothing real?

152
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,600
You must be upset with...

153
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,680
...everything happening at the same time.

154
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,970
Sometimes,I think that...

155
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,970
...the person you trust...

156
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,770
...and love the most...

157
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,680
...is not the person you see.

158
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,109
Although I have eyes which can see everything,...

159
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,880
...this pair of eyes...

160
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,770
...is not able to look into human characters.

161
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,109
You can. Why can't you?

162
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,310
Sometimes,I'm also afraid you will see my mind.

163
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,280
Tell me,...

164
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,360
...if I didn't have the Golden Eyes earlier,...

165
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,450
...will Grandfather Gu...

166
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,480
...still be alive?

167
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,720
Uncle De...

168
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,740
...may still be that Uncle De.

169
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,600
If that were the case,...

170
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,120
...Siheyuan wouldn't exist.

171
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,080
We may still be staying at the basement,...

172
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,760
...eating cheap take-outs and hiding from the landlord.

173
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,560
We wouldn't know about the Gem Association,...

174
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,090
...the Myanmar auction...

175
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,280
...or Yunnan King of Jade.

176
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,880
Besides,without that robbery related to your Golden Eyes,...

177
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,480
...we will not meet Feifei,...

178
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,800
...and Xiaofei and Miss Qin.

179
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,300
I'll also not be meeting my Miss Xiaojia.

180
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,680
Life would be so boring.

181
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,440
There's one thing which you don't need to worry about.

182
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,840
Whether you have the Golden Eyes or not,I will not leave you.

183
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,480
I will stay in your basement, stealing you instant noodles...

184
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,360
...and ask you to start a business with me.

185
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,600
Maybe we will be rich someday.

186
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,960
Sometimes,...

187
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,000
...like when we were in primary school,...

188
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,320
...the presentations can go forth and back.

189
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,240
The broken glass...

190
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,530
...may be repaired miraculously.

191
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,760
It would be great...

192
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,600
...if I can turn back time.

193
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,040
I know it's impossible.

194
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,240
Stop dreaming.

195
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,360
Where are you going, Xiao Bailong?

196
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,760
Fine,just stay here.

197
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,680
Although you have lost many valuable things,...

198
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,640
...but Xiaorui, you must not be upset.

199
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,200
Don't be depressed.

200
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,000
The broken cup can still be put back together.

201
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,000
The spilled milk can be wiped off.

202
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,440
You have to continue living.

203
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,040
As long as you persevere,...

204
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,360
...you will have a new tea cup,a new life...

205
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,640
...and new milk.

206
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,360
You have changed.

207
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,770
I've become more handsome,right?

208
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,560
You became more cheesy.

209
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,060
It seems that you have healed.

210
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,610
Remember to take the medicine.

211
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,480
Good. You don't even answer my call now.

212
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,680
No. How dare I do that?

213
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,540
I'm really happy to see your call.

214
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,600
I am accompanying Xiaorui.

215
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,280
Both of you are men. If you aren't sleeping at night,...

216
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,240
...what are you doing?

217
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,880
We're discussing official matter.

218
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,560
What is it? Tell me.

219
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,000
There are clues about Old Ma. -Who is Old Ma?

220
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,200
Then,this means that the truth will come out soon.

221
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,880
This is a good thing.

222
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,530
You will not believe me.

223
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,010
It's really unbelievable. It's true.

224
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,880
What happened?

225
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,240
Miss Xiaojia,...

226
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,840
...if you have a friend whom you trust the most,...

227
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,360
...but you find out that you don't really understand him.

228
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,160
He has done a lot of bad deeds.

229
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,250
If it were you, what will you do?

230
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,480
I don't know.

231
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,130
Xiaoyun,are you all right?

232
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,840
I'm okay.

233
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,960
No matter what, I will accompany you.

234
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,920
Don't think too much,Xiaoyun.

235
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,760
Sleep earlier.

236
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,120
Sure. Miss Xiaojia, sleep earlier,too.

237
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,720
Good night. -I love you.

238
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,280
Brother,I'll accompany you.

239
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,000
Zhuang Rui,when you read this letter,I have already left.

240
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,730
My apologies for not wishing goodbye.

241
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,320
This painting is my gift to you.

242
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,960
The necklace was personally created for you.

243
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,520
It's a pity that I cannot produce it in time.

244
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,440
Keep it as a momento.

245
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,280
Thank you for the bamboo cricket you have given me.

246
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,480
That bamboo cricket...

247
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,960
...has accompanied me for many days and nights.

248
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,200
It seems that I didn't prepare the wrong gift.

249
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,160
A cricket.

250
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
Did you make it?

251
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,220
It is also known as the 100-day insect as its lifespan is short.

252
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,560
It cannot survive past the winter solstice.

253
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,620
However, the happiness it brings...

254
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,800
...will always remain.

255
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,960
It's a pity that I have lost it.

256
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,280
Zhuang Rui, I know you have the great eyes.

257
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,840
But what is more valuable is...

258
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,240
...your pure heart.

259
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,280
I know that I have done many wrong things...

260
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,360
...but I have always been sincere to you.

261
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,280
Please believe me.

262
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,850
Can we still return to the way things were?

263
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,920
Thank you for forgiving me and for still treating me as a friend.

264
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,480
I hope you will find the answer you want.

265
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,080
Don't worry.

266
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,600
Let's go together.

267
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,520
You have done well. Your first gambling...

268
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,680
...is competing with the retailers...

269
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,140
...and fight for justice.

270
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,440
Do you know that you are a hero?

271
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,410
It's a gift for meeting. Do you like it?

272
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,400
Thank you,Mr. Nakagawa.

273
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,410
Why don't you allow Zhuang Rui to send you?

274
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,680
Zhuang Rui...

275
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,160
...should still have things that he want to do.

276
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,240
I will not trouble him.

277
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,640
You're worried that you will be sad.

278
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,160
I have already done...

279
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,410
...what I can do for him.

280
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,280
There's nothing to be sad about.

281
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,680
All feelings and grudges...

282
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,800
...should end here.

283
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,380
Are you sure that you don't need me to accompany you?

284
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,520
No.

285
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:35,080
I must face certain things by myself.

286
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,320
Thank you,Mr. Nakagawa.

287
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,240
Thank you for everything that you have done for me.

288
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,800
Sometimes,I think that...

289
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,960
...if none of these happen,...

290
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,960
...maybe we...

291
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,080
...could be...

292
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,800
...more than friends.

293
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,680
If none of these happen,...

294
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,920
...how would I have met you?

295
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,000
It seems that I should be grateful for all these...

296
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,730
...for allowing me to meet you.

297
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,660
I will go first.

298
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,050
Please remember...

299
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,000
...that you are always welcomed in my house,...

300
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,240
...Kojima Maki.

301
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,640
Thank you.

302
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,340
Zhuang Rui,...

303
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,320
...the report is out.

304
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,720
That knife is the weapon used to kill Grandfather Gu.

305
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,960
The weapon is always with Uncle De...

306
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,680
...and I never know.

307
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,880
So,Uncle De is the real murderer.

308
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,640
We can only prove that the knife is the weapon.

309
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,720
It just happen to be on the rack in Uncle De's house.

310
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,530
It cannot prove that Uncle De is the murderer.

311
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,440
I have investigated Uncle De's movements.

312
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:39,320
I found that he had booked a ticket to Yunnan at that time.

313
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,200
What can this prove?

314
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,970
We have also been to Yunnan.

315
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,760
Zhuang Rui, can you be realistic?

316
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,480
The weapon is in his home and this schedule is enough to prove...

317
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,760
...that Uncle De can commit the murder. He is the most suspicious.

318
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,640
Fine. What about the motive?

319
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,840
Why would he do this?

320
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,280
Don't you understand?

321
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,560
Uncle De is Ma Tengfeng while Grandfather Gu knows about...

322
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,159
...what happened back then.

323
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:16,080
By killing Grandfather Gu, his plan will be perfect.

324
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,400
That's right.

325
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,040
The truth has surfaced.

326
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,280
Don't worry,Officer Miao.

327
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,840
I have sent her off.

328
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:42,280
Zhuang Rui,there are things I have not told you.

329
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,000
While the jade was at my pawn shop,...

330
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,800
...there were people who wanted to buy it but I rejected them.

331
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,760
After that, the robbery occurred.

332
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,960
It seems that the person who wanted to buy the jade...

333
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,720
...was Uncle De.

334
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:08,440
As Uncle De could not buy the jade,he set up the robbery.

335
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,920
I always suspect that...

336
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,120
...there is a spy in the pawn shop.

337
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,160
Initially, I suspected Zhuang Rui.

338
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,520
It turns out to be Uncle De.

339
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:30,320
Qin Haoran and Qin Xuanbing were ordered by Uncle De.

340
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,720
I knew that you will help me to find the map.

341
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,960
So,the pawn shop robbery, Boss Yu's Gansu tomb theft,...

342
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,260
...Myanmar's jungle treasure map and the search for Feng Quan...

343
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,640
...were planned by Uncle De to find the jade...

344
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,320
...so that Zhuang Rui will...

345
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,460
...activate his Golden Eyes.

346
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,320
If so,...

347
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,880
...the most cunning person is not Qin Haoran...

348
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,880
...but his boss,...

349
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,280
...Uncle De.

350
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,400
The true one stays hidden while the fake stays in the open.

351
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,040
Uncle De is a legend in the antique world.

352
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,640
I always want to meet you.

353
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,000
Never thought that I can meet you here today.

354
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,280
I must have been blessed. -It's not.

355
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,720
Boss Qin,you're too polite. I'm just an old person.

356
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,320
I'm always wondering...

357
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,060
...how did Xiaorui have such good eyesight.

358
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,840
He is actually your student.

359
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,720
Your eyes are really good.

360
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,040
You can see it but cannot have it.

361
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,930
With half a month training, you could find out two mistakes.

362
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,290
It's not wrong to call you as the reincarnated Feng Quan.

363
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,760
Life is but a dream.

364
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,200
Only those enlightened will experience what is known as...

365
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,840
...life is like a dream with many sadness.

366
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:28,440
You must know that you are stronger than you imagine.

367
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,840
You are no longer an unknown person.

368
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,440
I went to Gansu to find my grandfather's notebook.

369
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,010
It was recorded that...

370
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,160
...Feng Quan didn't obtain the Golden Eyes...

371
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,160
...because of releasing a huge turtle...

372
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,040
...but due to an accident.

373
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,440
Boss Qin...

374
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,040
...is also an experienced person.

375
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,720
Why is he so persistent in regards to this?

376
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,520
Didn't you say it's just an archaeological notebook?

377
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,160
Is it really that interesting?

378
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,090
Actually, this is left by my grandfather.

379
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,820
Your grandfather?

380
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,520
It recorded many strange experience of the expedition team.

381
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,320
I think Qin Haoran doesn't just want this notebook.

382
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,440
Hello,Zhao.

383
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,920
Okay,let's prepare and depart.

384
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,320
Uncle De booked a ticket to Kiev two days ago.

385
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,840
To Kiev? Is he running away?

386
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,480
It must be because of the jade I hid in the Victor's museum.

387
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,000
Immediately contact Victor to have more people to guard it.

388
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,640
Let's prepare to go to Kiev.

389
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,960
Zhuang Rui!

390
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:50,440
Long time no see. You're still powerful.

391
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,760
Brother De,you don't need to be troublesome.

392
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,440
Don't worry. The world is dangerous.

393
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,440
Isn't it better to be careful?

394
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,720
Here,come and warm yourself.

395
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,560
This is not China,...

396
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,760
...it's Kiev.

397
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,040
Why are you worried when you come to my territory?

398
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,360
Besides, if I want to hurt you,...

399
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,920
...will these people be able to stop me?

400
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,640
Where is A'Kun?

401
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,000
I have not misjudged you back then.

402
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,680
Now that you have your own business,you won't listen.

403
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,680
You're rude when talking to me.

404
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,480
I don't dare to. After all,...

405
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,450
...I didn't starve because I followed you back then.

406
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,880
It's been long since anyone calls me A'Kun.

407
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,380
Never thought that...

408
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,200
...you will become like this.

409
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,800
Tell me.

410
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,120
You escaped from China to here. What's your plan?

411
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:27,400
Escaped? This word is not suitable.

412
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,760
Who is looking for me?

413
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,920
I'm here because I have an important plan.
