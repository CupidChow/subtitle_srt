1
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,000
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 33

3
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,289
The doctor said that it's not serious.

4
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,340
She'll be fine after resting.

5
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,370
I think last night was an accident.

6
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,330
The tent wasn't lit so she hit herself on the head.

7
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,860
It's possible.

8
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,000
No.

9
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,650
Look at this.

10
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,720
It's a broken shard from a camera flash.

11
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,180
I found this on the ground.

12
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,770
If I'm not mistaken,...

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,840
...someone must have followed Professor Meng...

14
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,560
...and used camera flash to hit her on the head.

15
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,530
Professor Meng. -Professor Meng.

16
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,329
Professor Meng.

17
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,440
How are you doing? -Zhuang Rui. Feifei.

18
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,240
Professor Meng,I'm sorry. I should've gone with you.

19
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,760
I'm all right.

20
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,920
What about the information?

21
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,840
I've checked it. Nothing is missing. Don't worry.

22
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,520
When I went there last night,...

23
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,320
...someone took me out with a hit.

24
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,680
Did you see the assailant's face?

25
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,600
Before I went in, I remember seeing...

26
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,380
...a flash of light from inside the tent.

27
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,720
A flash of light?

28
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,300
We're the only ones on the grassland.

29
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,920
We are far from the farm,too.

30
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,930
This area is not easily accessible...

31
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:28,010
...so no one could've come easily.

32
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,440
It must be an insider. The flash of light...

33
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,120
...must be someone secretly taking a picture and saw you.

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,280
If it is an insider, the mastermind...

35
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,500
...must be with the group that attacked me and Ba Te'er.

36
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,940
Professor Meng is injured...

37
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,520
...and confidential information was leaked,....

38
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,250
...I'll settle this with them.

39
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,760
Insider?

40
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,400
In our archaeological team, besides my students,...

41
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,040
...there are security guards and some external hire.

42
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,080
There are too many people. We can't blow this up.

43
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,540
Right now,I can only trust...

44
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,269
...both of you.

45
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,720
I will work with security...

46
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,970
...to check all outward mails from this site.

47
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,120
There's no need for that.

48
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,940
I found this at the scene of the incident.

49
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,080
This should be a broken shard of a camera flash.

50
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,560
If we check all cameras in the team using serial numbers,...

51
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,480
...we'll be able to find the one.

52
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,920
You have a point.

53
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,120
When everyone goes down the tomb later,...

54
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,440
...I will check the equipment storage.

55
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,720
You'll go to all the other tents.

56
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,650
Check for any broken camera flash.

57
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,040
Check them all and don't miss any.

58
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,760
Zhuang Rui,I heard something happened to professor. What is it?

59
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,690
Professor hit herself on the head last night.

60
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,180
The excavation is delayed for half a day.

61
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,840
We'll resume when the professor is feeling better.

62
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,800
Look at the unpredictable weather.

63
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,640
If the excavation is delayed,...

64
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,680
...it will affect the preservation of relics.

65
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,940
Why don't we..... -Xiaoren is right.

66
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,340
Professor,are you all right?

67
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,800
You're injured so please rest.

68
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,159
I'll handle the excavation. Don't worry.

69
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,200
All right.

70
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,480
The old bones,...

71
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,080
...the 2,000-year-old relics,...

72
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,760
...are waiting for me to see the light of day.

73
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,860
Professor.

74
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,200
It's me.

75
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,300
They're getting suspicious.

76
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,120
They'll find out that it's me.

77
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,240
Before this,the excavation work that Professor Meng couldn't do...

78
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,920
...was given to me.

79
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,500
However,the circumstance this time is different.

80
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,220
That's it. I've heard enough.

81
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,880
I've gotten what I wanted.

82
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,960
You've gotten your money.

83
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,640
Our relationship is based on this deal.

84
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,280
About the consequences,...

85
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,040
...you'll face it yourself. -What?

86
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:56,560
Don't call this number again.

87
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,800
One last thing,good luck.

88
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,400
Miss,there's neither corpse nor jade.

89
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,480
Our informant has been exposed so we can't investigate anymore.

90
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,760
Will they find out it was you?

91
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,740
That's not possible. Miss,don't worry.

92
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,360
Good.

93
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,680
You do as you see fit.

94
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,080
Remember,I want Zhuang Rui alive.

95
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,360
Okay.

96
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,080
Zhuang Rui.

97
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,580
Zhuang Rui,what you're holding seem to be mine.

98
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,960
This equipment belongs to the team.

99
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,560
I'm taking it back for the professor. Is it wrong?

100
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,160
It does belong to the team...

101
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,520
...but going through my personal items...

102
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,880
...is wrong,isn't it?

103
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,880
Zhuang Rui.

104
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,240
Listen to me. Zhuang Rui!

105
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,360
Zhuang Rui,I can explain.

106
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,680
Where were you...

107
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,290
...at 1 a.m. last night?

108
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,880
About what happened to Professor Meng?

109
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,840
Yes,I did it.

110
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,000
Why?

111
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,920
Research work don't pay well.

112
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,080
I have to support my parents.

113
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,160
My classmates are either teaching...

114
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,440
...or doing their own thing but I followed Professor Meng.

115
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,880
She has never given me a definite answer.

116
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,250
Whether she wants to take over her job or other projects.

117
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:32,440
It isn't easy for me to find a job as an archaeology graduate.

118
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,560
Zhuang Rui,please let me go. I beg your forgiveness.

119
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,640
It was a moment of greed. I won't do it again.

120
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,120
Greed? -Zhuang Rui,...

121
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,040
...please forgive me this time.

122
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,410
Forgive you?

123
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,880
Let you go? I can't decide that.

124
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,480
Will you report me?

125
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,580
The information will be made public,you know that.

126
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,840
Yes,you're right but it's not time yet.

127
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,080
The consequences of leaking information...

128
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,280
...before the archaeological work ends.

129
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,880
I'm sure Professor told you.

130
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,400
If you have more excuses,...

131
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,880
...tell it to the police.

132
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,880
Are you crazy?

133
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,440
What a talker.

134
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,960
His bones and vital organs aren't injured...

135
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,120
...but he needs a checkup. -Okay,thank you.

136
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,040
Will you confess now or wait until we return?

137
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,490
You can't escape this,anyway.

138
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,040
If you confess now, you might be given leniency.

139
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,360
I pity you.

140
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,880
You studied so much...

141
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,060
...yet you do such a thing.

142
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,920
How will you face the professor?

143
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,360
Officer Miao.

144
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,260
Professor.

145
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,180
I'm here to see my student.

146
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,040
We went into these tombs together.

147
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,040
When I have arranged all these information...

148
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,900
...and publish a book,...

149
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,440
...I was going to name you as co-author.

150
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,520
You have spent your years doing archaeological work with me.

151
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,300
If only today's incident didn't happen.

152
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,540
I was waiting for you to graduate.

153
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,120
After you graduate, I wanted you to take over from me.

154
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,760
Professor.

155
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,040
I've made a mistake. Professor,...

156
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,720
I have a question for you.

157
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,240
Go ahead.

158
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,500
Professor,...

159
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,240
...can I still enrol for your doctoral class in prison?

160
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,120
Professor.

161
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,720
Professor!

162
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,120
Make this quick. -Sister,he confessed.

163
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,440
Yes,there's another meeting place.

164
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,080
A villa out of town.

165
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,800
The buyer was a man. That's all we know for now.

166
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,200
We also know the dealing was through phone.

167
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,400
A man?

168
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,380
Wait for me, I'll return as soon as possible.

169
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,660
Okay,understood.

170
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,520
Come in.

171
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,850
Has Professor Ren been taken away?

172
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,320
I wasn't a good teacher.

173
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,730
I've failed to produce a good student.

174
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,360
Have a seat.

175
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,060
Is there anything?

176
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,760
Yes,Professor Meng,....

177
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,600
...do we still not know the identity of Tomb No. 1?

178
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,040
This granary can usually tell of...

179
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,760
...the lands and provisions that the tomb master owned in his life.

180
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,120
Looking at Tomb No. 1,...

181
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,200
...saying that the tomb master was rich is not an exaggeration.

182
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,960
The burial items and materials used were of superior quality.

183
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,500
The tomb master was a Han Chinese and a Qin nobility.

184
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,360
It's strange that.....

185
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,970
What's strange?

186
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,360
There are no burial items or bronzeware which was the norm.

187
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,620
Without these,we can't identify his identity.

188
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,520
After Shang Yang's reformation took place in the State of Qin,...

189
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,320
...many people were promoted due to their military contributions.

190
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,240
I think he might be one of them.

191
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,820
I had the same thought.

192
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,200
From his background,he looks like a low-ranked nobility.

193
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,880
I don't understand how he was able to amass these treasures.

194
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,520
Wonders of the common man...

195
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,560
...might be found in classical history books.

196
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,640
Professor,there's one more thing. -Go ahead.

197
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,280
Feifei has urgent matters so she's leaving soon.

198
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,160
Do you want to leave with her?

199
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,880
You should go.

200
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,760
Although I'd like you to stay,I can tell...

201
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,690
...that you are part of something bigger.

202
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,500
Professor.

203
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,120
You belong to the future while I belong to the past.

204
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,240
I belong to the stories that are buried underneath.

205
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,800
Some stories are meant to be buried,...

206
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,920
...while some stories are waiting to be awakened.

207
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,600
Just like me and you. I should stay...

208
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,280
...and you should go.

209
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,920
Professor, when the weather is nice,...

210
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,250
...let's take a picture together.

211
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,080
That's a deal.

212
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,650
Be careful on the road and don't speed.

213
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,040
You must take care,too. -Okay.

214
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,840
I've checked the car.

215
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,640
I didn't expect you to leave so soon.

216
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,570
Thank you for your trouble.

217
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,440
Don't mention it. You are all guests of the grassland.

218
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,640
Feifei,you're welcome anytime into the arms of the grassland.

219
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,440
Into the arms? I'll go into your arms.

220
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,920
Thank you,...

221
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,290
...Ba Te'er.

222
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,850
I will not forget...

223
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,880
...my brother in the grassland.

224
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,730
I'm leaving.

225
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,840
Stay safe.

226
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,480
Take care.

227
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,770
We're leaving. -We'll meet again.

228
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,640
Goodbye. Drive slow.

229
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,520
I'm back!

230
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,560
Xiaofei! Open the door!

231
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,280
Xiaofei!

232
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,600
Is he sleeping again? Who is that?

233
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,400
Xiaoyun! Xiaofei!

234
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,050
Who is it in the middle of the night?

235
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,040
Xiaoyun,I'm back!

236
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,440
Stop knocking!

237
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,560
I was in the middle of a game!

238
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,000
Let me see who you are!

239
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,680
I'm back.

240
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,720
Xiaorui,is that you? -It's me.

241
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,810
You're back? -I'm back.

242
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,160
You're finally back! What? You're afraid of my kiss?

243
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,640
Give me a kiss.

244
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,640
I'm back.

245
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,600
Am I dreaming? -No,I'm really back.

246
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,120
It doesn't hurt. -Of course not. You pinched me.

247
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,320
I'll rub it for you. It really is you.

248
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,480
Are you two done? Don't you want the suitcase?

249
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:48,840
Let me do it.

250
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,220
If you say so. -Let's come in and talk.

251
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,200
You went to Inner Mongolia...

252
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,130
...but was chased after and went missing.

253
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,280
You almost couldn't return.

254
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,760
It's a good thing I went to the temple and got you an amulet.

255
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,800
It will deliver you from all evil and ensure your safety.

256
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,600
No,this is my fertility amulet.

257
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,570
This one.

258
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,720
This one is a love amulet.

259
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:29,850
Keep it well.

260
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,000
This one is for prosperity, for rain,...

261
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,180
...and for a bigger house.

262
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,600
This is the protection amulet.

263
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,640
You must have it on you at all times.

264
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,560
Aren't you worried for my safety?

265
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,640
Feifei,it doesn't get any safer with you.

266
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,770
I specifically went to the temple to get you the love amulet.

267
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,040
Only a real friend will do this.

268
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,560
Your fair-weather friends will never do this.

269
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,880
If you don't want it, give it to Rui.

270
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,480
It doesn't matter who has it anyway.

271
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,720
Well,I've sent him and his suitcase here. I'll leave now.

272
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,440
I'll send you off. -There's no need.

273
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,240
It's for romance! Forget it.

274
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,640
I heard you got injured in Inner Mongolia...

275
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,300
...and Feifei took care of you all night.

276
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,760
Two single adults shared a room together.

277
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,490
Something must have happened.

278
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,740
What could have happened?

279
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,120
For example,like this.

280
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,440
There is. -Really? After that?

281
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,640
After that?

282
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,340
This happened.

283
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,640
This is exciting. What's next?

284
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,100
She held me down like this.

285
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,040
Continue.

286
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,420
After that,...

287
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,330
...the nurse gave me an injection.

288
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,170
That wasn't fun.

289
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,280
How many times have you dealt with Brother Liu?

290
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,050
It's the first time.

291
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,960
The first time?

292
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,880
The car was filled with relics.

293
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,290
In other words, the car was filled with money.

294
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,100
With so much money at stake, if you were Brother Liu,...

295
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,680
...would have hired a stranger to do it?

296
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,140
Besides,Old Zhao already has a criminal record...

297
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,260
...so when this is over, a long sentence awaits him.

298
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,820
You're different.

299
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,520
Didn't you just become a father?

300
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,960
I don't think you want to be in prison...

301
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,850
...when your child say his first word.

302
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,240
Officer,I don't know anything.

303
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,090
I was only told to drive the car.

304
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,400
I believe that you are not part of them...

305
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,960
...which is why I'm giving you a chance.

306
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,480
Why don't you think again? See if you can remember anything.

307
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,040
Yes,about the buyer.

308
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,940
Brother Liu called him A'Gui.

309
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I heard it myself.

310
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,200
A'Gui?

311
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,840
See if you can think of something else.

312
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,260
There's nothing else.

313
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,320
His name is A'Gui. -There's no rush.

314
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,180
He has a case record of smuggling.

315
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,250
I can wait for you or I'll come again tomorrow.

316
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,040
Xiaozhao,what's the situation?

317
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,200
Sister Fei,we've watched them the whole morning.

318
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,660
The curtains are up so we can't see anything.

319
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,090
Besides,there have been no movement.

320
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,680
I suspect there is another entrance.

321
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,210
Okay. You'll enter after us. Block all exits.

322
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:04,880
All right.

323
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,740
Let's move.

324
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,060
Sister Fei.

325
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,440
We're too late.

326
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,200
Seal up the crime scene. Get the medical examiner.

327
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:53,720
Yes.

328
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,400
Attack! -Punch him!

329
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:15,890
Kick him!

330
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,360
It's over.

331
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,560
Grandfather,are you sure I came from you?

332
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,200
Of course not. Your father came from me.

333
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,620
You came from your father.

334
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,040
I'm asking you if we are blood-related.

335
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,480
As much as I'd like to deny it,...

336
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,340
...we are indeed blood-related.

337
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,560
What kind of grandfather are you? You keep winning. I'm not playing.

338
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,280
No,don't say that.

339
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,200
Your grandfather is begging you. One more round.

340
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,040
I'll go easy this time. Here,my good grandson.

341
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,080
Really? I'll believe you. -Of course.

342
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,480
You'll let me win. -Come.

343
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,810
There's no rush.

344
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:08,960
Punch him.

345
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,120
Punch him. -Dodged.

346
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,840
Old man,didn't you say you're going easy?

347
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,600
Who's going easy?

348
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,040
One must be responsible for his character.

349
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:29,890
Understand?

350
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,960
Grandfather,if you go on like this,I'll leave the house.

351
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,160
Sure but leave the console behind.

352
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,360
What kind of person are you?

353
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,840
You beat me in games and don't care that I just got back.

354
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,860
Mentioning that makes me angry. -What's wrong?

355
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,800
I went through a lot along the way.

356
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,960
Yet Zhuang Rui is the first thing you asked me about.

357
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,280
Aren't you worried about your grandson?

358
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,760
Aren't you doing well now?

359
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,100
About that.

360
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,040
You haven't told me about Zhuang Rui. What happened?

361
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,160
I don't know. Ask him yourself.

362
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,080
Fine,I'll do just that. It's not that hard.

363
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,360
Practice by yourself. Bye!

364
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,380
I'm sure I was adopted.

365
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,960
Sister,you're still here?

366
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,000
I can't crack this jade figurine case.

367
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:14,190
Tell me,someone was killed for this jade figurine,...

368
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,300
...does it make sense?

369
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,670
Sister,this case is already handed over to Team B.

370
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,489
They'll get to the bottom of it so don't worry.

371
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:28,000
Zhao,make some instant noodles for me.

372
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,120
Sure.

373
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,120
Sister,isn't today your birthday?

374
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:39,480
I'm having a birthday party for you at Siheyuan tomorrow.

375
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,120
I forgot all about it! Why didn't you remind me?

376
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,700
I'll take this.

377
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,210
Yes,there is none according to the information at hand.

378
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:23,560
The wall painting of an eye must have been drawn by Feng Quan...

379
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,130
...in his delirious state.

380
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,840
It's strange that his body wasn't in the tomb.

381
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,720
Perhaps someone has raided his tomb...

382
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,570
...and taken away his body.

383
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,840
However,there was no sign of tomb raiding.

384
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,170
Could the problem be The Life of Feng book?

385
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,080
I've confirmed this.

386
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,960
The Life of Feng book was written by Feng Quan.

387
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,760
It can't be wrong.

388
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,240
Keep investigating.

389
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,330
Yes,father.

390
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,360
Miss.

391
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,480
Why did you only come now?

392
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,580
I had to settle matters about the jade figurine.

393
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,080
Nothing will go wrong. -Good.

394
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,610
I'm going to Yunnan tomorrow. You're coming with me.

395
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,880
Yes,miss. Your father has informed me.

396
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,970
I'll make sure you're safe.

397
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,570
This way.

398
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:55,880
Did you do all these yourself?

399
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,120
I prepared a grand birthday party...

400
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,090
...yet you arrived late. What have you got to say?

401
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,680
Liu Jia,I'm sorry. I'll let you punish me...

402
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,840
...any way you want. I'll even offer my life to you.

403
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,120
No,I'll even marry you.

404
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,080
I'll accept this apology.

405
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,120
Inviting the whole world wasn't a mistake.

406
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,240
Who else was invited? -You'll see when you go in.

407
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,140
I'll go in then. -Fix your collar!

408
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,280
All right.

409
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,760
Go!

410
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,280
You did it. -Go straight ahead.

411
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,020
Don't panic. -You mustn't panic.

412
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,000
Yes. -The birthday girl is here!

413
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,120
Why are you moving like a snake? Go straight.

414
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:45,280
Go straight. -Don't say that.

415
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,560
Keep moving. -Grandfather,you're too slow!

416
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,400
I'm here! -Come on.

417
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,760
Don't talk.

418
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,050
Keep moving.

419
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:56,960
Grandfather!

420
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,480
Reverse!

421
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,200
Good. -Keep driving.

422
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,000
Let me help you. -Are you here for my birthday?

423
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,600
Let's go. Keep driving. -Get on the road.

424
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,520
Good. -That's the way.

425
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,880
You crashed it again!

426
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,160
Where's Zhuang Rui? Is he late?

427
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,640
Surprise!

428
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,640
Happy birthday!

429
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,640
Come,let us sing the birthday song.

430
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,040
Okay. In 3,2,1.

431
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,040
Happy birthday to you,...

432
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,640
...happy birthday to you,...

433
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,800
...happy birthday to you,...

434
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,360
...happy birthday to you!

435
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,360
Miss.

436
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:42,320
Are you sure it's stone No. 007? -Yes.

437
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,020
However,the stone is marked at only RMB 60 million.

438
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,140
This doesn't showcase our company's strength.

439
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,760
Don't worry. Anything we bid on...

440
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,040
...will not be at such low price.

441
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,880
I have a plan. Don't worry.

442
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:06,880
Okay.

443
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,820
Grandfather Gu,you're here.

444
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,840
I'm making honey water for them since they drink a lot.

445
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:28,760
Yes.

446
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,880
Xiaorui,have you been falling sick lately?

447
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,840
Xiaoyu told me that you lost your hearing in Inner Mongolia.

448
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,770
It's nothing serious. I'm all better now.

449
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:45,480
In Chinese medicine, all five senses...

450
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,000
...are connected to one another.

451
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,400
Any other parts of your body bothering you?

452
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,840
Since you mentioned it, I did lose my sight...

453
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,400
...when in Phakant.

454
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,880
However,I regained it after two days.

455
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,840
This can't be taken lightly.

456
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,600
I know a good doctor. I'll give him a call.

457
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,360
If it doesn't work, we'll find another doctor.

458
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,480
Thank you. You're a nice person. -Nonsense.

459
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,080
Of course I know that.

460
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,090
Grandfather Gu,I'm going out.

461
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,170
It's late. Where are you going?

462
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,320
It's important. I'll be back in a while.
