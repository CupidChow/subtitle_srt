1
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,800
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Episode 48

3
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,080
Mr. Feng, have you thought about...

4
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,240
...designing your own ceramic?

5
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,800
Create artwork according to the current trend.

6
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,120
The Tang Dynasty Sancai you made...

7
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,759
...is flawless...

8
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,040
...but it lacks vicissitude.

9
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,800
A fake is after all,fake.

10
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,560
You can use ancient clay...

11
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,200
...and materials...

12
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,960
...but you can't replicate the humanity and society back then.

13
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,160
Trying to replicate these differences...

14
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,720
...isn't something man can do.

15
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,079
Yes.

16
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,280
Instead of... ...imitating your predecessors,...

17
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,280
...why don't you create your own designs?

18
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,820
I like antiques...

19
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,160
...but I also like craftwork that has yet to become antique.

20
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,079
Your craftsmanship is as good as those in the past.

21
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:48,400
If you hone your skills,...

22
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:51,079
...I believe that after thousands of years,...

23
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:55,720
...your craftwork will be sought-after antique.

24
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,640
I understand. -I understand,too.

25
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,080
Are you sponsoring a work station for Mr. Feng?

26
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,680
Yes,in Beijing.

27
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,000
Bei.....

28
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,560
Sure.

29
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,440
We're rich, so we can afford this.

30
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,480
I have to say,the cost will be 3 times of that in Gansu.

31
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,280
There also be...

32
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,320
...labour costs and transportation costs.

33
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,560
We're not firing clay but burning money.

34
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,820
Are you okay with this?

35
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,160
Of course!

36
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,640
Of course I'm okay with doing things I love...

37
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,640
...and earn money from it,too.

38
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,840
I'm more than okay with this.

39
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,720
All right. First,let your hand heal.

40
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,920
That's secondary. First,we'll determine the share allocations.

41
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,120
Labour costs and materials costs,too,right?

42
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,840
Don't worry about the costs. Anything you need,...

43
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,040
...just tell Xiaoyun. -Okay,thank you.

44
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,760
Zhuang Rui. -Okay,I'll wait for you.

45
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,380
Don't move.

46
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,080
Why is it you?

47
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,160
Why am I here?

48
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,960
I'll call the doctor.

49
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,280
No need.

50
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,560
Qin Haoran doesn't need me anymore.

51
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,040
You don't get anything by saving me.

52
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,060
The Qin family will not thank you.

53
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,240
You're also not a threat to the Qin family.

54
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,960
Miss Qin.

55
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,440
I have no plans to take advantage of you.

56
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,880
I just hope that you'll live.

57
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,440
Live?

58
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,800
Living...

59
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,760
...means nothing to me now.

60
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,760
Miss Qin.

61
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,520
You like amber fragrance,right?

62
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,760
My father once said...

63
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,730
...that ambergris is secreted from the intestine of sperm whales.

64
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It floats on the ocean for a long time.

65
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,120
The stronger the storm, the longer it deposits...

66
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,000
...and the cleaner it is.

67
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,680
It will have a stronger smell,too.

68
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,760
Miss Qin.

69
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,440
This was just one round of storm.

70
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,240
You are free.

71
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,640
When you've recovered, you may leave anytime.

72
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,200
I have a favour to ask of you.

73
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,120
Zhuang Rui will arrive in Beijing tomorrow.

74
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,000
If you wish to meet him, I'll bring him here.

75
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,840
Zhuang Rui.

76
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,120
Is he all right?

77
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,480
Miss Qin is awake? Does she remember what happened?

78
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,760
She does.

79
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:43,640
Boss!

80
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,490
She's alive. Go to the hospital. -Yes.

81
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,700
She was almost killed by Qin Haoran's men...

82
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,080
...and trapped under the collapse.

83
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,840
It's a miracle that she survived this.

84
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,400
Qin Haoran's ruthlessness is nothing new.

85
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,520
However,I can't believe...

86
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,040
...that he would do this to his own daughter.

87
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,480
I've sent men to retrieve information on the Qin family.

88
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,040
We should get it soon.

89
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,640
How do we tell Zhuang Rui about Miss Qin?

90
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,040
So my father could return to Japan safely...

91
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,920
...because of Mr. Zhuang's help.

92
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,320
Did your father ever mention someone called Xiaoma?

93
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,560
There's sporadic account of events in Gansu.

94
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,640
Just like in Mr. Zhuang's notebook.

95
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,560
However,there isn't much about this killer.

96
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,160
He only mentioned...

97
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,960
...that the man was evil but was good at hiding it...

98
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,800
...so they let their guard down. Hence,they were attacked.

99
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,360
Let their guard down?

100
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,280
They let their guard down...

101
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,300
...because it was someone from the team.

102
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,200
So,...

103
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,160
...who is Xiaoma?

104
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,760
Leader Miao,the evidence team sent information of members...

105
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,440
...of the archaeological team 40 years ago.

106
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,760
How is this possible?

107
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,800
No one with the surname Ma or with Ma in their names...

108
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,040
...in the archaeological team.

109
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,800
What? No one with the surname Ma?

110
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,320
Not even Ma in their names.

111
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,760
I just remembered.

112
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,010
The body count of those in Feng Quan's tomb...

113
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,650
...with Zhuang Qiming and Nakagawa Yohei...

114
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,210
...checks out with the information from the evidence department.

115
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,160
Where is Xiaoma?

116
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:38,800
Yes.

117
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,400
Feifei. Feifei! Come here.

118
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,420
Chief Ding!

119
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,400
I'm on a case. Can you wait?

120
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,730
When are you going to give me the Gansu report?

121
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,450
I'll give it to you soon.

122
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,410
Hurry up.

123
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,920
There's many things to attend to from this Gansu trip.

124
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,160
I need to organize our clues.

125
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,800
Let's put Xiaoma's matters aside for now.

126
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,280
I'm meeting Chief Ding now. Bye.

127
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,640
Don't rush. Take it slow.

128
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,240
The truth will prevail.

129
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,800
I don't have time.

130
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,080
I have the same symptoms as your father.

131
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,420
I'm losing my 5 senses. Headaches...

132
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,100
...and dizziness are more frequent now.

133
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,060
Cherry blossom has 7 days.

134
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,460
I think I'm at the end of the 7 days.

135
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,040
Zhuang Rui,I'll do my best to save you.

136
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,160
In the desert, Kojima and Aoyama...

137
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,600
...risked their lives to save me.

138
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,520
Now,Qin Xuanbing lost her life for me.

139
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,540
I don't want anyone else to sacrifice for me.

140
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,560
I'm begging you.

141
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,100
Please don't tell him that I'm alive.

142
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,840
Why?

143
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,040
My presence in his life...

144
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,320
...does not help him at all.

145
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,120
I don't want him to see me...

146
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,640
...and pity me.

147
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,920
I'd rather he thinks I'm dead.

148
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,680
At least,...

149
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,160
...he can still remember me.

150
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,240
I don't have much time...

151
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,840
...but I hope before I die,...

152
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,300
...we can find my grandfather and Grandfather's Gu's killer.

153
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,370
I don't want to die with regret.

154
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,210
Zhuang Rui is being watched by Qin Haoran.

155
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,240
He's suffering from the side effects of the Golden Eyes.

156
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,800
There's also Xiaoma.

157
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,280
If I spread the news that Zhuang Rui has the 4th stone,...

158
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,460
...his safety would be compromised.

159
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,680
I know that you and Zhuang Rui are close.

160
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,160
That has nothing to do with this.

161
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,320
I just think we need to focus on Qin Haoran and Xiaoma.

162
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,920
Not on someone we need clues from.

163
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,200
Either it's evidence on the Qin family or clues on Xiaoma.

164
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,410
...there is no substantial progress.

165
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,850
Zhuang Rui is a patient and we'll make sure he's safe.

166
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,560
However,what if? I mean,just imagine.

167
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,800
If Zhuang Rui dies due to his illness,...

168
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,680
...all our leads will be.....

169
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,240
I'm sure Zhuang Rui doesn't want this to happen.

170
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,640
There are no "what-ifs".

171
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,040
Why can't you understand this,Feifei?

172
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:09,660
The Golden Eyes case is not just about Zhuang Rui alone.

173
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,109
It involves China and Japan.

174
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,720
If we lose this lead,safety of the whole society is at risk.

175
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,250
If the suspect finds the secret of the Golden Eyes...

176
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,800
...and mass replicate it,...

177
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,829
...the entire jade and gold industry...

178
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,420
...will be in total chaos!

179
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,040
Feifei,listen to me.

180
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,160
You can't use your emotions to make decisions...

181
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,720
...in your job. -It's not like that.

182
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,650
What do you mean it's not like that?

183
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,720
Don't let emotions cloud your judgements. Do these things.

184
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,760
Firstly,contact the hospital and find ways to cure the Golden Eyes.

185
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,800
Next,a task force will be set up to investigate...

186
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,040
...Qin Haoran,Xiaoma and the 4th stone.

187
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,200
Listen,if there isn't any substantial progress...

188
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,200
...within this week,...

189
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,160
...Xiaozhao will take over the Golden Eyes case.

190
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,680
I will also prepare the plan for the fake stone.

191
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,920
Consult Zhuang Rui about this idea.

192
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,160
Yes,understood.

193
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,080
I'll make a breakthrough from Xiaoma.

194
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,500
One more thing.

195
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,490
Finish up your investigation report.

196
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,130
Understood.

197
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,480
Why are you here?

198
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,000
I just came back. Why are you so jumpy?

199
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,000
Well,I'm writing something to Miss Xiaojia.

200
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,800
All right. Continue.

201
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,180
What..... You made copies of grandfather's notebook?

202
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,800
What? I did it to find a cure for you.

203
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,320
How does this help?

204
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,480
We can at least notice a pattern.

205
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,320
There are accounts of Nakagawa Yohei's relapse.

206
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,080
For example,...

207
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,920
...on 17th October,...

208
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,720
...he had eggs for breakfast and fell ill at noon.

209
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,930
What does this tells us?

210
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,280
Food high in protein...

211
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,840
...could worsen the illness.

212
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,840
Thank you,but Nakagawa Ryosuke's father is allergic to eggs.

213
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,680
Perhaps you should call Miss Xiaojia.

214
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,640
I'm afraid your relationship will be unstable.

215
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,360
Xiaorui,are you home?

216
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,560
Uncle De?

217
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,410
Uncle De is here. I'll get the door.

218
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,520
There's always someone better than you.

219
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,120
Since I've already made copies,...

220
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,600
...I might as well make more copies.

221
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,320
After the call with you, the supermoon appeared.

222
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,000
I thought I was lucky...

223
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,480
...but we encountered dust storm in the desert...

224
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,700
...and we were also poisoned.

225
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,890
It's a good thing we found the cave temple.

226
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,960
Exploring the desert...

227
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,480
...has always been dangerous.

228
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,840
It's true that you had some troubles on this trip...

229
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,840
...but you're back now. You're very lucky.

230
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,240
Next time,if you're going on any expeditions,...

231
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,400
...please choose somewhere safe.

232
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,240
Actually,our trip to Gansu is not an expedition or exploration.

233
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,840
40 years ago,my grandfather and a member of his team...

234
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,850
...went missing there.

235
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,020
I went there to find an answer.

236
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,600
Well.....

237
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,560
My grandfather and the whole expedition team...

238
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,210
...perished in the desert.

239
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,560
It was underneath Feng Quan's tomb.

240
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,080
Uncle De, I remember you told me...

241
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,020
...that Feng Quan had special powers...

242
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,540
...because he released a turtle.

243
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,610
That's what it says in the Eight King's article,too.

244
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,160
I found my grandfather's notebook on this Gansu trip.

245
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,440
It's written that Feng Quan didn't have the Golden Eyes...

246
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,580
...after letting a turtle go.

247
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,200
He has the Golden Eyes because of an accident.

248
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,440
So the myth about Feng Quan's discerning eyes is true.

249
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,570
Exactly. Besides that,...

250
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,210
...Feng Quan's life story was written on his tombstone.

251
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,400
We confirmed this with one of his descendants.

252
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,520
It means that Feng Quan's legend is true.

253
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,360
Feng Quan's extraordinary vision...

254
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,380
...is called the Golden Eyes.

255
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,890
The Tamamoku stones that he had...

256
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,920
...could bring about extraordinary ability.

257
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,480
I can't believe such things exist.

258
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,440
He left behind a few pieces of it.

259
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,880
Perhaps these stones allow one to possess extraordinary powers.

260
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,410
This was recorded in my grandfather's notebook.

261
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,040
They explored...

262
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,480
...Feng Quan's tomb.

263
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,400
One of the members, Nakagawa Yohei,...

264
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,360
...met with an accident.

265
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,600
As a result, he has the Golden Eyes.

266
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,250
However,...

267
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,200
...there's a young man, Xiaoma,amongst them.

268
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,520
When he knew the secret, he became evil and greedy.

269
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,170
He went after my grandfather and Nakagawa Yohei.

270
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,280
My grandfather died because of this.

271
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,960
With more valuable treasure...

272
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,760
...comes greater danger.

273
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,320
This has been the way since the past.

274
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,000
So,have you found...

275
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,840
...the one called Xiaoma?

276
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,170
This is our problem now.

277
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,450
We've been investigating.

278
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,700
However,no one in the expedition is called Xiaoma.

279
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,650
No one with the surname Ma,too.

280
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,400
Uncle De,look at this picture.

281
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,960
Perhaps you see something from this?

282
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,860
All the members of the expedition team here?

283
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,340
Yes.

284
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,400
Who took this picture?

285
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,080
Could it be Xiaoma?

286
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,320
If Xiaoma was not part of the expedition team,...

287
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,280
...could he be a local?

288
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,690
Uncle De,you're right. I'll ask Feifei to investigate.

289
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:05,040
Chief Ding,I've talked to the evidence team.

290
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:10,040
Xiaoma could be a local guide for the expedition team.

291
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:14,040
So he couldn't have been in the picture or in any records.

292
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,040
Village census 40 years ago weren't complete or standardized.

293
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,000
It won't be easy for Gansu police to locate this man.

294
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,500
This is difficult.

295
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,680
Then I'll go to Gansu.

296
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,640
I'll check nearby villages.

297
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,050
Okay. I'll await your news.

298
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,320
There will be a breakthrough this time.

299
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,160
Hurry up then. Remember,safety first.

300
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,360
Miss Qin,you have many joint injuries.

301
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,650
You can't delay physical therapy any longer.

302
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,080
Or else,...

303
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,800
...you may have permanent damage on your body.

304
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,600
I told you I'm tired.

305
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,140
I want to be left alone.

306
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,770
Even if there's permanent damage,...

307
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,480
...it's my choice.

308
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,640
You don't have to take responsibility.

309
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,680
Doctor,thank you.

310
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,720
Give me a minute with Miss Qin.

311
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,760
Mr. Nakagawa,I'm tired.

312
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,240
I know.

313
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,400
Your heart is weary.

314
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,680
I've always been curious.

315
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,140
You're the only heir of the Qin family...

316
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,480
...but you're different from daughters from rich families.

317
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,840
You're calm and matured.

318
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,120
It turns out you're not Qin Haoran's birth daughter.

319
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,440
With an adoptive father like him,it's indeed tiring.

320
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,900
You made a background check on me?

321
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,210
I want to give you a new identity...

322
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,000
...so I had to find out...

323
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,880
...the truth about Qin Xuanbing's background.

324
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,690
Qin Xuanbing has died in the cave temple that collapsed.

325
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,500
Compared to becoming a young lady in Qin family,...

326
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:26,880
...the identity of Kojima Maki will make you at ease.

327
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,800
You'll feel safer,too.

328
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,200
Safer?

329
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,120
Safer?

330
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,850
What do you mean?

331
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,040
You know too much.

332
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,320
To Qin Haoran, you've sided with Zhuang Rui.

333
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,320
I'm sure he doesn't want you to live.

334
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,640
I know what Brother Gui did to you...

335
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,520
...in the desert.

336
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,770
Brother Gui is only one of my father's men.

337
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,400
He doesn't represent my father.

338
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,840
My relationship with Qin Haoran is complicated.

339
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,760
I planted a few men...

340
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,760
...near the cave temple.

341
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,880
After the collapse, Qin Haoran sent men to ask around.

342
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,240
About Zhuang Rui and the Tamamoku stone.

343
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,920
However,your name was never brought up.

344
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,760
Qin Haoran never intended to bring your bones back.

345
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,360
You know nothing.

346
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,400
Qin Haoran tried to save my father...

347
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,520
...and hurt his leg and now he's in a crutch.

348
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,440
I owe him that much.

349
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,180
Of course I have to return the favour.

350
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,840
Is your birth father, Zheng Chuan?

351
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,560
He founded Ai Xi Jewellery that took Kiev by storm.

352
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,640
My father gave me this...

353
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,120
...as my 7th birthday present.

354
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,920
No painting! You're a liar! Where's my present?

355
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,560
You didn't prepare anything!

356
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,160
Why would I lie to you?

357
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,920
Have a seat.

358
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,180
Hold it.

359
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,200
This is your present.

360
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,380
Thank you,father.

361
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,570
Happy birthday, my beloved daughter.

362
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,000
Qin Haoran and Zheng Chuan were close. They went to Beijing...

363
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,800
...to meet an investor,right?

364
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,440
Yes.

365
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,440
Father brought me along to Beijing.

366
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,040
However,he and Qin Haoran was attacked by a rival...

367
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,160
...on the way.

368
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,040
Attacked by a rival.

369
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,400
Did Qin Haoran tell you that?

370
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,370
After Zheng Chuan's death,...

371
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,140
...Xi Huang Jewellery didn't receive any projects from Beijing.

372
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,200
There was no document about...

373
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,730
...the meeting in Beijing.

374
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,520
I know what you're thinking.

375
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,440
However,I saw Qin Haoran getting shot...

376
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,570
...with my own eyes.

377
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,320
Miss,Mr. Zheng and Mr. Qin's meeting...

378
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,720
...should be over by now.

379
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,360
Father!

380
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,630
My father is inside!

381
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,100
Miss,it's dangerous!

382
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,630
Don't come over! Call the police!

383
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:36,840
Hurry!

384
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,230
Father!

385
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,190
Father!

386
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,670
Father!

387
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,160
What you saw...

388
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,800
...was the outcome.

389
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,440
You didn't see the alleged rival.

390
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,480
You didn't see how Zheng Chuan died.

391
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,700
The outcome is Zheng Chuan died and Qin Haoran survived...

392
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,120
...and took you in.

393
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,480
No.

394
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,940
It's not possible.

395
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,010
Qin Haoran has no reason to harm my father.

396
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,240
They were friends.

397
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,000
My father's death doesn't benefit him at all.

398
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,760
He even injured his leg.

399
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,480
Doesn't benefit him at all?

400
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,000
You were just a child.

401
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,720
A child's testimony is the easiest to manipulate.

402
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,880
He earned your trust and used your testimony...

403
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,060
...to escape police suspicions.

404
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,520
He later adopted you...

405
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:06,120
...and took over Zheng Chuan's Ai Xi Jewellery.

406
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,720
Isn't this benefit?

407
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,320
Do you have any proof?

408
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,240
If I do,we would be in court right now.

409
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,760
When I found out about this, I had to tell you.

410
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,760
The 4 bodyguards that Qin Haoran took along to Beijing...

411
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,320
...was fired within a year.

412
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,280
When Qin Haoran was reshuffling Ai Xi's Jewellery management,...

413
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,280
...one of your father's partners criticized Qin Haoran publicly,...

414
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,540
...saying that he warned Zheng Chuan...

415
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,480
...that Qin Haoran is a cunning person...

416
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,130
...who will eventually kill Zheng Chuan.

417
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,320
Doesn't this tells us something?

418
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,600
If I don't tell you these,...

419
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,480
...I'm afraid that when you meet Qin Haoran again,...

420
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,800
...you'll end up just like your father!

421
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,880
Enough! Don't say anymore.

422
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,760
I'm sorry.

423
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,280
I know this is too much for you.

424
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,320
However,I don't want to see you lying on this bed.

425
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,720
You have a choice.

426
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,460
If you want to investigate your father's death,I'll help you.

427
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,940
If you don't want to face all this,...

428
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,200
...you can choose...

429
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,770
...to come with me to Japan.

430
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,140
I'm waiting for you...

431
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,200
...to stand up for yourself.

432
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:21,880
Leader Zhang.

433
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,400
Officer Zhang,I'm sorry for troubling you again.

434
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,320
It's all right, but this case...

435
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,760
...is over 40 years old so it won't be easy.

436
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,160
It's okay. This is good enough.

437
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,400
There're about 600 villagers in 3 villages.

438
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,480
I don't believe that I can't find any clues.

439
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:43,800
Okay.

440
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,760
Excuse me,I have a question to ask you.

441
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,000
I'm sorry. -Thank you.

442
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,920
Hi,do you know the expedition team that was here  years ago?

443
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,440
I don't know. Ask other people. -Thank you.

444
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:21,840
Hi.

445
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,880
Are you from this village? -No,I'm not from here.

446
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,800
Thank you.

447
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,980
Don't force yourself.

448
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,320
You can do it.

449
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,600
Miss,are you looking for the wrong person?

450
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,960
Everyone in this village has the surname Li.

451
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,320
There are no other surnames. -Aunt,are you sure?

452
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Yes,I'm sure.

453
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,160
Wife.

454
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,570
Have you forgotten?

455
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,300
There was someone who married into our village.

456
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,760
Old Liu married Widow Liu who was from another village.

457
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,440
That widow even had a young son.

458
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,250
How can I remember that?

459
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,440
When I married you,...

460
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,200
...Old Liu had already died.

461
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,560
You're right. -Uncle.

462
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,680
Do you remember the surname of Widow Liu's son?

463
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:10,900
I think it's Ma.

464
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,340
That child was stubborn. He refused to change his surname.

465
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,480
Old Li complained to me about it.

466
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:24,080
After Widow Liu died, Xiaoma left the village.

467
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,500
Do you remember where he went?

468
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,720
I don't remember about that.
