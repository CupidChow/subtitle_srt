1
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,200
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Episode 11

3
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,240
The Xu family has always hosted these events the last few years.

4
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,720
Except for that one time you messed up.

5
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,120
For this auction...

6
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,440
...I've invited the best jewellers in Southeast Asia.

7
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,880
Do what you're supposed to do to redeem your honour.

8
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,640
Don't let anyone question your position in the company.

9
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,680
Okay,uncle.

10
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,000
Brother Ma.

11
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,400
I can't believe that you'd trust me after that last time.

12
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,880
That's all in the past. Everyone makes mistakes.

13
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,280
Forget it.

14
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,800
Nonetheless,I do have to say some unpleasant things.

15
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,680
If you ever pull that kind of stunt again...

16
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,560
...you're done for, do you hear me?

17
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,920
Brother Ma,I.....

18
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,440
I.....

19
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,920
In my entire life,I..... -What are you doing in public?

20
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,600
Brother Ma may trust you...

21
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,400
...but I Don't.

22
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,720
Brother Ma,I..... -Get it together,man.

23
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,400
Say what you want to say. -Okay.

24
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,040
Tell me if there's anything good.

25
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,720
Alright. Let's go get it.

26
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,760
Cut San'er some slack,will you?

27
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,400
He is Old Mr. Gu's disciple after all.

28
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,760
I trust him professionally.

29
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,800
Without Xiaorui,he's the only one we can count on.

30
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,400
Both of you ate together yesterday. He's down...

31
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,760
...but you're still fine?

32
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,800
I Don't know. I went back with Miss Xiaojia after that.

33
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,079
Where did you go? -Where did we go?

34
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,520
We went back to the hotel.

35
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:58,800
The hotel?

36
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,800
Did you do it?

37
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,520
Do it? Relax. There's no rush.

38
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,560
When wooing girls, we must be patient, serious.

39
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,160
You sly dog.

40
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,160
Go and take a look.

41
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,600
I heard that store is selling out.

42
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,120
That fast? -Let's go check it out.

43
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:24,880
Go and take a look.

44
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:28,840
Hurry up.

45
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:42,120
Stop dawdling. It's going to sell out.

46
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,080
This is sold. Don't touch that. That's sold too.

47
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,360
So fast? Who bought it?

48
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,040
Probably the Xu family. -The Xu family?

49
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,200
My goods are from Old Hou Jiang. How can it not sell out?

50
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,960
Old Hou Jiang?

51
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,920
Brother Ma, what is Old Hou Jiang?

52
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,280
Old Hou Jiang?

53
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,080
San'er,Old Hou Jiang.

54
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,000
Hou Jiang mines,serves as an entrance to the Kan Di valley.

55
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,440
The old entrance is known as Old Hou Jiang.

56
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,600
The new entrance is known as New Hou Jiang.

57
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,240
The quality of the stones found in Old Hou Jiang is top notch.

58
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,520
Even though there isn't much volume...

59
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,440
...but if you work on the stones enough,...

60
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,920
...the colour of the stones will deepen. It's a common phenomenon.

61
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,480
The quality of stones from Old Hou Jiang is guaranteed.

62
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,680
That's why it's so expensive.

63
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,600
Not bad.

64
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,400
So that's what it means.

65
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,120
What if the stones can't be worked on,Brother Ma?

66
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,080
Yes. What happens then?

67
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,240
It's a gamble.

68
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,000
If we can't do it, it's just a stone.

69
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,520
Even if it's from Old Hou Jiang, it's not a sure thing.

70
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,880
If it's a sure thing, it's not a gamble anymore.

71
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,080
I heard that Old Hou Jiang has been mined out,though.

72
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,000
If there really is a stone from Old Hou Jiang,...

73
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,040
...there's a high chance of it being a gem.

74
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,400
Let's check it out. -Let's go.

75
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,560
Wait up.

76
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,200
Excuse me. Make way,please.

77
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,960
Excuse us. This way please,Brother Ma.

78
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,880
This way,please.

79
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,520
Look at that.

80
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Let me see.

81
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,280
Is this the one?

82
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,159
Are you sure?

83
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,320
Take a look at it.

84
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,840
It's good stuff.

85
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,040
Madam.

86
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,800
The price is right there.

87
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,440
I'm taking this.

88
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,280
Just like that? -Good eye,sir.

89
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,240
This is the real deal. An original from Old Hou Jiang.

90
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,760
Brother Ma,can I invest some money in this,too?

91
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,680
Of course. How much were you thinking?

92
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,520
10%.

93
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,600
Dream on!

94
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,680
You're mad.

95
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,440
It's just that,I have to keep a low profile,you see?

96
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,520
What is this mess? Didn't we agree on going half?

97
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,040
That's fine. -You'll get it if you invest.

98
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:45,080
Okay. -San'er,get to work.

99
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:45,880
We'll buy this.

100
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,760
How rich.

101
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,760
You just have to sign right here.

102
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,480
Don't move it too quick.

103
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,520
Hurry up.

104
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,240
How can such a good stone be a dud?

105
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,720
San'er,polish the other side.

106
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,600
Okay.

107
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,920
There's nothing on both sides.

108
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,960
This is a certified dud.

109
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,480
Forget seeing the colour green.

110
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,440
There's absolutely nothing.

111
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,760
What are they doing with that kind of stone?

112
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,000
If it were up to me, I would split it in half.

113
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,800
They'd be able to tell if it's worth anything.

114
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,640
Who says they won't split it?

115
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,520
Let's see if there's going to be any more good stuff.

116
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,160
What is this?

117
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,240
We're in trouble now,Xiaorui.

118
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,480
The stone is a dud. -A dud?

119
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,320
If it's a dud, just come home and rest.

120
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,840
Why would I do that?

121
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,560
I'm going after the seller.

122
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,000
Shi San'er said that there's something fishy about the stone.

123
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,840
Money doesn't grow on trees,you know?

124
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:49,880
Is it the one from the photos? -Yes,it's the one.

125
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,880
Whether or not this stone pans out,...

126
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,240
...I know that it's a matter of luck.

127
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,320
It's possible that someone could pull a fast one on us,right?

128
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,560
He's being difficult.

129
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,240
Get to the point.

130
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,080
I'm not happy about this.

131
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,360
So?

132
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,920
I Don't think we can take this lightly.

133
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,240
We need a good explanation.

134
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,000
Can Shi San'er confirm it? -He can't.

135
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,000
That's why I wanted you to take a look at it.

136
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,840
It's not just me. Brother Ma is pretty antsy,too.

137
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,840
Even though he could care less about the money,...

138
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,560
...he doesn't want to be embarrassed.

139
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,320
Get to the point.

140
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,240
Hurry up and come here.

141
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,600
Didn't I tell you? My stomach hurts and I can't go.

142
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,720
If you Don't come, my entire being will hurt.

143
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,360
It's settled then. Come quick. I'm waiting.

144
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,120
Thank you.

145
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,440
This way,please.

146
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,200
Put that away. Don't whip it out for no reason.

147
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,000
You're scaring me.

148
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,160
Here you go.

149
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,400
You Don't come when I tell you to.

150
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,200
Now,you show up without me telling you.

151
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,120
I'm pretty busy today.

152
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,560
It's fine. I'll just wander around by myself.

153
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,880
I feel uncomfortable having you with me.

154
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,480
Can't you see that I'm worried about you?

155
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,720
Are you worried that I'll get deceived?

156
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,800
Who dares deceive the great Officer Miao?

157
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,360
They probably couldn't even if they tried.

158
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,720
I'm just worried about you being all alone.

159
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,520
You probably wouldn't understand any of those things.

160
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,680
That's enough,I'm going now. I'll call you if I get lost.

161
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,920
Does that work? -That's fine.

162
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,960
You're busy. Get back to work. -When I'm done,...

163
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,680
...I'll take you out for dinner and we'll spend time tomorrow.

164
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,360
Okay. Off with you!

165
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,320
Call me if you need anything.

166
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,400
Get back to work. -Bye.

167
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,400
I'm here. -Who is it? Cut it out.

168
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,520
Xiaorui?

169
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,760
You're finally here. -I'm surprised you recognized me.

170
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,600
Does your stomach feel better?

171
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,120
Why are you wearing a mask? -It's nothing.

172
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,840
My throat doesn't feel good.

173
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,080
How did your stomachache move to your throat?

174
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,640
The weather is humid and your throat is hurting?

175
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,800
What will you do when you return to Beijing?

176
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,360
It's hard to say. Let's check out the stones.

177
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,800
Brother Mo. -How will you see like that?

178
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,680
I'll just take them off. -Okay.

179
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,160
Let's go. -Let's go.

180
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,000
San'er.

181
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,080
Have Xiaorui take a look at this.

182
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,480
I'm sure this stone is from the Hou Jiang mines.

183
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,040
However,the exterior is thicker than usual.

184
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,920
It feels a little soft.

185
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,080
I've also touched the gravel.

186
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,400
It feels.....

187
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,880
I can't put my finger on it.

188
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,400
It doesn't look like it's an Old Hou Jiang.

189
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,320
Yue Qun keeps claiming...

190
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,120
...that her stones are from Old Hou Jiang. This is a fraud!

191
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,640
What do we do? It doesn't feel right.

192
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,960
There's still hope for this stone.

193
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,680
What do you mean?

194
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,040
I'm begging you, hurry up and tell me.

195
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,760
As they say,bet on the cracks,not on the marks.

196
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,680
This should be the mark of flame.

197
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,360
The mark of flame on a stone...

198
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,520
...indicates that the stone will absorb colour,...

199
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,720
...every last drop of it.

200
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,640
Yes. I see it too.

201
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,240
That's why I thought it was strange.

202
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,360
However,some of these mark of flames...

203
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,800
...do not absorb colour.

204
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,240
Is that true?

205
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,280
Wait a minute.

206
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,040
Can you speak Chinese? -Shut up.

207
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,760
Please,go on.

208
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,360
Colour absorption is a phenomena where the colour of a jade...

209
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,520
...is absorbed by something else for unknown reasons.

210
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,360
Since we've come this far,...

211
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,440
...we might as well go all the way.

212
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:08,280
Let's do as Xiaorui says and give it a go.

213
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,310
Split the stone in two. -Do that.

214
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,640
I need closure before I die.

215
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,280
You need to watch what you say.

216
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,349
Let's go. How about...

217
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,920
...I pick a couple of stones for you?

218
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:27,280
Okay.

219
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,680
I'm sorry to bother both of you.

220
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,200
You are? -Mr. Xu Wei.

221
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,280
I'm Miao Feifei,a detective from the Beijing Crime Unit.

222
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,800
What's the matter?

223
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,760
I have a few questions for you, please cooperate with us.

224
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,720
I'm sorry,officer. If you have any questions,...

225
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,440
...please refer to my lawyer.

226
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,840
We have somewhere to be. Let's go,Bingbing.

227
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,640
Wait a minute.

228
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,680
Go ahead. -If you're busy,...

229
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,120
...I'll leave you two alone. -No need for that.

230
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,960
How about this? You go ahead without me.

231
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,200
I'll be right with you.

232
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,600
You had questions? Make it quick. I'm busy.

233
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,520
Mr. Xu Wei.

234
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,520
Do you own a Buick sedan...

235
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,800
...with the licence plate 3719?

236
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,000
I have many cars under my name. I can't remember all of them.

237
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,080
This car was clearly registered under your name.

238
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,400
That doesn't mean anything.

239
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,400
What car did you say it was?

240
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,840
A Buick...

241
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:54,000
...with the license plate 3719.

242
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,680
I own a Buick?

243
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,800
That's news to me.

244
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,120
What's the matter with the car?

245
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,960
Seeing as you weren't aware about it,...

246
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,800
...you wouldn't know who has been in it.

247
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,320
Of course not. I Didn't even know I had a Buick.

248
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,920
I leave my cars in the garage. Anyone in the company can use it.

249
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,640
Do you recognize this man?

250
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,000
Who is this?

251
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,680
Where and what were you doing on the night of the 20th?

252
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:35,000
The 20th? Goodness, I Don't even know the date today.

253
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,720
Let me refresh your memory.

254
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,000
That night,you were at the Beijing Jade Convention.

255
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,440
That night?

256
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,000
I was having a bad day. After the convention,...

257
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,920
...I went home for a nightcap.

258
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,080
Do you have an alibi?

259
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,960
Officer,I told you. I went home alone for a nightcap.

260
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,720
Pretty lady. Oops,officer.

261
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,320
Are you going to arrest me or not?

262
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,440
If you're not, I have somewhere else to be.

263
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,280
If you see anything that you like,you can have it.

264
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,040
Stop messing around. Move aside.

265
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,400
Come over here. It's cooler.

266
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:59,440
Cover it up.

267
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,880
Can you stop messing around?

268
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,440
Be gentle.

269
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,960
Look at that.

270
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,200
Our bet has paid off. There's a silver of green.

271
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,320
Who would have thought? -This is a miracle.

272
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,200
Rose from the ashes.

273
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,560
Who would have thought? -It's good stuff.

274
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,200
Let me do it.

275
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,400
Well done,San'er.

276
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,720
There's some green. -Ouch! That's my shoulder.

277
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,840
Give me a minute.

278
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,480
Zhuang Rui, you're indeed a lucky charm.

279
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,240
There is a silver of green.

280
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,080
Don't say that,Brother Ma.

281
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,000
I Didn't do anything.

282
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,880
If anything, you should thank Shi San.

283
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,720
From what I see, it isn't the best quality...

284
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,680
...but it should be enough for us to recoup our costs.

285
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,520
Hold on,tell that to San'er. I Don't understand.

286
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,480
Okay. -I'll listen in,too.

287
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,480
Brother San? -Brother Zhuang.

288
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,040
Did you feel anything off with the stone?

289
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,240
That's right. It Didn't feel right in my hands.

290
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,040
I see. -Yes,it felt wrong...

291
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,640
...from the very first touch. -I see.

292
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,640
Everybody thought that this batch of stones...

293
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,400
...was from the Hou Jiang Mines.

294
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,920
The sizes,the shapes and the colours checks out.

295
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,440
Yet,there's a New Hou Jiang and an Old Hou Jiang.

296
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,600
New Hou Jiang is a little different.

297
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,880
Old Hou Jiang stones are thicker,...

298
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,800
...but the stones from New Hou Jiang are bigger.

299
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,880
The quality is not as good as Old Hou Jiang's.

300
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,920
The stone that you bought is likely from New Hou Jiang.

301
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,320
Are you sure? Do you have any evidence?

302
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,640
It's not really evidence, it's the mark of flame.

303
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,760
Normally,only the stones from New Hou Jiang...

304
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,000
...have the mark of flame.

305
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,600
Only New Hou Jiang stones have it.

306
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,400
Brother Zhuang, are you sure of this?

307
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,400
I've only heard about this from Grandpa Gu.

308
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,880
However,in this industry, experience matters most.

309
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,880
There are no guarantees.

310
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,720
Okay,fine. I understand.

311
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,880
Okay. -Bye.

312
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,120
What does this mean?

313
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,240
They might be passing off New Hou Jiang stones...

314
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,680
...as Old Hou Jiang stones to sell.

315
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,240
I Don't care about that, just tell me if we've made a loss.

316
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,160
Not on what we've bought but it's still not right.

317
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,920
Were we deceived?

318
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,120
Those crooks.

319
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,720
How could I have missed it?

320
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,560
They pulled a fast one on us.

321
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,120
These crooks. Let's meet up...

322
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,400
...with other customers who were also deceived by her...

323
00:24:37,120 --> 00:25:51,640
...and get our money back. -Let's do that.

324
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,320
What's going on?

325
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,440
This way,madam.

326
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,920
That's her. -Madam.

327
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,360
How will you explain this?

328
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,520
What's wrong? -Take a look.

329
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,280
That brilliant streak of green. Why are you angry?

330
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,200
Don't change the topic. You need to explain yourself!

331
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,920
You need to explain yourself!

332
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,440
Explain myself? This stone is clearly a jade.

333
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,280
What you're doing is fraud and you know it.

334
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,800
Our stones have been authenticated...

335
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,560
...by the professionals at Xu Gemstones.

336
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,240
This isn't from the Hou Jiang mines.

337
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,600
Stop arguing.

338
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,120
Don't all of you know the rules here?

339
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,440
No refunds once sold.

340
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,040
Why not? -These goods are all fake.

341
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,320
They're obviously fake. We're returning them.

342
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,880
Mark my words, I'll set my dogs on you

343
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,520
Bring it on! -You can't do this.

344
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,520
Isn't that Director Yue?

345
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,480
What's going on? -That's enough.

346
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,680
Someone probably struck out. It happens every year.

347
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,760
Forget it. Let's go somewhere else.

348
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,800
Since We're here, let's help her out.

349
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,240
Bingbing.

350
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,600
Take what you want. -I Don't want.

351
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,840
The colours are different. -Call the police.

352
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,560
Hello,Mr. Ma. -Hello.

353
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,720
Who does this half-processed stone belong to?

354
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,480
This stone belongs to me and my brother,Huang Fuyun.

355
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,240
Would the both of you mind giving me the stone?

356
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,720
I'm rather interested in it.

357
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,200
Of course.

358
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,000
Isn't that Director Xu?

359
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,520
What are you doing standing there?

360
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,960
Let me introduce you. Director Xu of Xu Gemstones.

361
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,040
He's the boss. This way,please.

362
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:41,920
Take a look at this.

363
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,360
This way,please.

364
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,360
You're here. They are accusing me of selling fake stones.

365
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,560
Please say something. What's going on here?

366
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,920
Whether or not you buy an original is never a sure thing.

367
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,400
You can only rely on your eyes and knowledge.

368
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,360
Whether or not the stone is real is on you.

369
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,880
That's right. You heard him.

370
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,160
Bingbing, do you like this stone?

371
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,400
I think the green in it is pretty.

372
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,640
Looking at this,it could be made into something decent.

373
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,400
I have more of these. You're welcome to pick any.

374
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,440
Let's not stay here any longer.

375
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,160
You're already here after all.

376
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,880
Tell us. What did you say to us this morning?

377
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,600
You said that every stone on display here...

378
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,440
...was sourced from the Old Hou Jiang mines.

379
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,640
That's why we bought this stone and somehow...

380
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,520
...stumbled upon a gem. For this piece of jade...

381
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,240
...I have to thank you.

382
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,600
Haven't you got what you wanted? You're welcome.

383
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,280
This is good stuff.

384
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,160
Ms. Qin,you honoured our stone.

385
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,760
We do intend to sell it for a good price...

386
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,440
...but if you plan to shop here,...

387
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,040
...do be careful. There are too many fakes here.

388
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,160
Sir,this is the Pingzhou auction.

389
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,800
You can't throw accusations like that around.

390
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,880
You can't just say things like that.

391
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,240
I'll admit it. You have a good eye and good luck.

392
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,240
You've struck gold.

393
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,880
What does it prove?

394
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,640
It proves that our stones are genuine.

395
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,280
That's true. This customer is being unreasonable.

396
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,640
That's because I was lucky. The others who weren't so lucky...

397
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,320
...are regretting their purchase.

398
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:26,240
You can't strike gold on every stone you buy.

399
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,400
It's not the first time that all of you are doing this.

400
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,680
Gathering people here like this won't change anything.

401
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,240
You've already retrieved your cost...

402
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,760
...so please stop bothering us.

403
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,720
You wouldn't want me to call security.

404
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,320
I'm not afraid.

405
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:47,360
With your stones here,it doesn't matter who you call.

406
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,840
What's fake is fake.

407
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,400
You're bullying..... I have to take this.

408
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:56,920
What's genuine is genuine.

409
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,440
What's fake is fake.

410
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,000
If they're of Old Hou Jiang,...

411
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,480
...I wouldn't mind a mere stone.

412
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,400
Yet,no matter how good it is, it's not from Old Hou Jiang.

413
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,200
This is false advertising. -Yes. He's absolutely right.

414
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,040
Gathering people here like this won't change anything.

415
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,080
Don't be a sore loser. Grow up.

416
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,600
You're absolutely right.

417
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,120
Identify jade takes luck...

418
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,480
...and knowledge.

419
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,320
Without knowledge,you won't know that the Hou Jiang mines...

420
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,200
...has two parts. Old Hou Jiang and New Hou Jiang.

421
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,200
Without knowledge,we wouldn't be able to tell the difference...

422
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,280
...between the stones.

423
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,000
However,you and Director Xu...

424
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,520
...knew this,didn't you?

425
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,880
What are you trying to say?

426
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,320
Did I sell you the stone?

427
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,360
Stop being pointless.

428
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,640
Old Hou Jiang stones are a surefire thing.

429
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,120
It's the only mine that doesn't produce duds.

430
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,160
Although New Hou Jiang stones look similar to Old Hou Jiang's,...

431
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,480
...they Don't have the same shine on them.

432
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,480
Although New Hou Jiang stones look...

433
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:17,120
...similar to Old Hou Jiang's,...

434
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,240
...they Don't have the same shine on it.

435
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,120
Even if it is a piece of jade, it'd be below par.

436
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,080
The stone that Brother Ma and I had bought...

437
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,280
...is not an Old Hou Jiang stone.

438
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,720
You're very eloquent, Mr. Huang Fu.

439
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,200
There is a saying.

440
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,200
Even a deity struggles to identify authentic jade.

441
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,440
Just a few words from you,...

442
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,400
...I doubt anyone here is really convinced.

443
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,760
I have sound reasoning and evidence.

444
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,520
The exterior of an Old Hou Jiang stone...

445
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,320
...is usually greyish-green in colour.

446
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,280
It happens because of the.....reaction...

447
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:57,520
...that changes the.....exterior.

448
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,240
Look at our stone.

449
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,560
Take a look,everyone.

450
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,680
It matches the criteria, doesn't it?

451
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,240
However,upon closer look,...

452
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,200
...the marks on the surface Don't run across fully.

453
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,920
The reason for this is...

454
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,680
...the fact that the exterior is too thick.

455
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,920
This is because they either...

456
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,280
...experienced very little...

457
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,240
...or no late-stage changes at all.

458
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,040
Most people Don't know this but...

459
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,000
...the stones from Hou Jiang mines are usually...

460
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,640
...around 300 grams.

461
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,480
There are some big ones...

462
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,000
...but it's relatively uncommon.

463
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,160
This gentleman has analysed it well.

464
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,120
Something is truly amiss with this stone.

465
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,040
Does this count as evidence? What do you have to say now?

466
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,920
Something is wrong indeed.

467
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,720
Everybody,there is one more thing.

468
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,280
The mark of flame...

469
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,240
...will only appear on New Hou Jiang stones.

470
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,720
Look at our stone.

471
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,320
Do you have anything more to say?

472
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,840
Madam,honesty is the best policy.

473
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,640
You should have an integrity doing business.

474
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:16,120
He's right. -Don't create a problem.

475
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,360
My business has maintained an excellent reputation.

476
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,520
What you're saying is impossible.

477
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,880
Okay. Even if I agree that...

478
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,520
...something is wrong with this stone,...

479
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,720
...it doesn't mean that there is...

480
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,560
...something wrong with all other stones,am I right?

481
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,160
The evidence is all here.

482
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,120
There's no point trying to get out of this.

483
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,080
That's right.

484
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,080
I've already made myself clear.

485
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,520
Are you going to deny everything until the end?

486
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,800
Am I right,everyone?

487
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:56,120
What's going on here?

488
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,880
What's the fuss about? Why are there so many people?

489
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,320
Chairman Gu. -Old Mr. Gu.

490
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,360
Hello,Old Mr. Gu.

491
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,630
Director Xu junior.

492
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,400
You knew about this,am I right?

493
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,520
This is very unbecoming of you.

494
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,710
Men are like jade. Jade is not easily tarnished...

495
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,400
...and neither are men.

496
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,520
This is a public event.

497
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,190
Aren't you worried that this will affect the Xu family?

498
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:40,320
Chairman Gu,this has nothing to do with the Xu family.

499
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:43,320
Yes,she is a friend of mine...

500
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,150
...but she's not selling Xu Merchandise.

501
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,800
Rest assured,I will not stand idly by when it comes to...

502
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,480
...the integrity of the auction or the reputation...

503
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,280
...of my family. I believe that my friend here...

504
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:56,880
...will settle this matter amicably.

505
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,480
Am I right,Ms. Yue?

506
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:03,960
Okay.....

507
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,320
It'd better be.

508
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,160
Dingyu. -Yes?

509
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,800
Remember the name of the shop owner.

510
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,640
Ban them from future events like this.

511
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,840
Did you hear what Chairman Gu said?

512
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,200
What else do you have to say? -Give us a refund.

513
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,640
Give us a refund. -Tell us now.

514
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Let's go,Bingbing.

515
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,720
My friends,we might have made a small mistake...

516
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,440
...in the authentication process. -What mistake?

517
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,720
How could it possibly be a mistake?

518
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,040
Those who want a refund, please form a line.

519
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,440
Refund me for this.

520
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:38,840
I want a refund.

521
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,560
Sister Fei, I've done as you told me to.

522
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,280
I've sent you the information on the Xu family in Pingzhou.

523
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,240
By the way,Old Mr. Yu was likely murdered...

524
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,760
...with a bow-like weapon.

525
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,960
The forensics lab is still looking into it.

526
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,640
Okay. Let me know when you hear anything.

527
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,840
Did you see the look on Xu Wei's face?

528
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,760
It felt so good.

529
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,200
That's in the past. Let's not dwell on it.

530
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,880
Let's go. -Since we're here,let's stay...

531
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,520
...a little longer. Take a look around.

532
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,520
What is there to see? Let's go.

533
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,000
Pick a few.

534
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,440
Mr. Huang Fu.

535
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,280
You..... Who are you?

536
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,480
My name is Yang Hao. I run a stall here.

537
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,600
I really admired the way you appraised the stone.

538
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:41,720
I have some stones from Hpakant at my stall.

539
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,240
If it's not too much trouble, would you drop by my stall...

540
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,560
...and take a look at them?

541
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,280
I'd appreciate any tips and pointers you have for me...

542
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,280
...when it comes to stone appraisal.

543
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,200
My stall might be small but our items are of good quality.

544
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,040
Please don't take my stall lightly.

545
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,440
We might be small but we pack quite the punch.

546
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,000
I see.

547
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,160
Of course,I'll do that.

548
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,880
You go ahead. I'll be right with you.

549
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,120
That's wonderful.

550
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:15,960
With you there, I'd feel assured.

551
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,000
Assured? -It would be a great honour.

552
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,000
About that.....

553
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,000
This person is?

554
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,040
This is my assistant.

555
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,280
Xiaowen.

556
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,200
Xiaowen will be coming with me,won't you?

557
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,000
You're most welcomed.

558
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,600
Sir,...

559
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,640
...this is my name card.

560
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,720
My stall number is on it.

561
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,760
I await your arrival.

562
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,200
Okay. You go on ahead.

563
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,360
I'll leave you to your affairs.

564
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,480
What are you doing?

565
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,480
Xiaowen?

566
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:55,640
It's just that.....

567
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,000
Sir Huang Fu.

568
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,640
It's the first time anyone has called me a sir.

569
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,840
Help a brother out,will you?

570
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:07,920
No thanks.

571
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,760
I didn't agree to help him.

572
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,360
You did,so you help him.

573
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:13,840
Xiaowen,hear me out.

574
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,840
Can't you help me out just this once?

575
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,400
I've worked hard these days. I haven't made any money...

576
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,800
..and I almost lost all my capital.

577
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,040
Look at the man.

578
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,920
He was so nice. Why Don't you help him out?

579
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,840
I thought you liked helping people.

580
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,640
You've changed,haven't you?

581
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,200
Let me set you on the right path.

582
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,400
Remember the first time you made money.

583
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:47,000
Was it not because of me? -That's enough.

584
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:47,840
How about this?

585
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,880
I'll help him out...

586
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,720
...on three conditions. Firstly,I Don't reveal myself.

587
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,840
Secondly,you listen to me. Thirdly,you bear the consequence.

588
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,040
Three conditions?

589
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,120
I would've agreed to ten conditions!

590
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,440
You're so nice,"Xiaowen".

591
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,840
Let's see how it goes in a bit. We'll be rich!

592
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,920
Mr. Yang,we're here. -Sir Huang Fu,you really came.

593
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,960
Wonderful! Thank you!

594
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,960
Xiaowen,you came,too? Feel free to browse.

595
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,840
Xiaowen,feel free to browse.

596
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,520
Browse all you want.

597
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,600
Sir Huang Fu, could you help me out and...

598
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,800
...take a look at these stones? -Sure,I'll do that.

599
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,640
We're a small business.

600
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,720
You know well I never expected you to accept my invitation.

601
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,400
We're not like the big corporations.

602
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,280
I put everything that I own into this.

603
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:01,920
Go ahead and take a look.

604
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,360
How is it going?

605
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,000
The stone is surely from Hpakant but not from an old mine.

606
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,120
If you want it, don't put your hopes up too high.

607
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,520
Mr. Yang, that is definitely Hpakant stone.

608
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,800
However,it's just a common stone.

609
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,840
Sir Huang Fu,I really can't pull the wool over your eyes.

610
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,800
To be honest,these stones...

611
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,360
...are a little below par in terms of quality.

612
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,760
I've kept the better ones for tomorrow's sealed-bid auction...

613
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,880
...and put them in the storehouse.

614
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,680
Mine is just a small business. I do what I have to do.

615
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,000
I hope you don't mind.

616
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,560
However,...

617
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,280
...you will still find jadeite...

618
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,680
...in these stones here.

619
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,320
The crux is your discerning eye...

620
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,920
...and of course,luck.

621
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,520
Yes,however from what I've heard,...

622
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,960
...Hpakant stones...

623
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,840
...have been mined to depletion now.

624
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,840
Why do you have so many of them?

625
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,800
You're right.

626
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,480
What you just mentioned is Hpakant stones from the old mine.
