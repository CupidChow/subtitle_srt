1
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,000
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 41

3
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,600
After that,I went back to the desert many times...

4
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,960
...but I couldn't find the cave temple.

5
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,200
This means that within 24 years,...

6
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,840
...it only appeared once. -Yes.

7
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,920
I've only seen it once.

8
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,080
When it appeared, the weather was strange.

9
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,720
It was dangerous as sand was everywhere.

10
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,570
Furthermore,it only appeared for a short while.

11
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,880
If I didn't escape in time, I would have died.

12
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,320
I might even be buried underneath with the cave temple.

13
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,060
I don't know what you're looking for.

14
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,690
However,you really should...

15
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,640
...stay here...

16
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,280
...and return home safely.

17
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,920
Do you still remember where you saw it?

18
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,640
Must you go there? -We need to find the cave temple.

19
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,960
No matter how dangerous it might be.

20
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,480
Look.

21
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,200
It should be around here.

22
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,880
However,the desert here...

23
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,330
...is no different from other desert.

24
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,740
There is no indication at all.

25
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,160
24 years ago,...

26
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,880
...I got lost in the desert with my camel.

27
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,250
I ran out of water...

28
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,480
...was about to die in the desert.

29
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,920
The moon was exceptionally huge that day.

30
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,000
How is it? Did you find any clues?

31
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,880
I think you shouldn't be too worried.

32
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,000
As long as we're patient and have faith,...

33
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,320
...we could be like Old Zeng...

34
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,540
...and the cave temple will come looking for us.

35
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,440
Miss Xiaojia is looking for me first.

36
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,200
I'll leave you to it, I've matters to attend to.

37
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,579
I'll be back in a while.

38
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,970
Hello,Uncle De.

39
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,040
I heard you're back in Beijing and went off to Gansu again.

40
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,600
I didn't get to see you. When will we have tea together?

41
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,200
Yes,I have some matters in Gansu.

42
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,360
When I'm done here, I'll pay you a visit.

43
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,159
What is it? Share it with me.

44
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,680
DO you know what is the supermoon?

45
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,440
The supermoon?

46
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,840
I remember that. The basic concept is...

47
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,960
...in the desert,...

48
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,480
...when the full moon shines on the desert,...

49
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,240
...the desert sand will be like the ocean tides,...

50
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,960
...rising up and down like the tidal waves.

51
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,160
Yes,it's as you described.

52
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,760
Do you know what causes this?

53
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,760
Similar to tidal waves,...

54
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,130
...it is caused by the sun and the moon.

55
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,320
Well,there are two high tides in the ocean daily.

56
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,560
In the desert, a phenomenon like this...

57
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,200
...comes periodically.

58
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,280
Periodic? Does it mean that when the time comes,...

59
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,400
...I can see the phenomenon? -That's not always the case.

60
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,520
You might not even see it in a lifetime.

61
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,900
However,the changing moon could affect it.

62
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,520
This phenomena is not something you'd like to see.

63
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,000
If you really want to see it, you'll just have to wait.

64
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,800
Okay. Thank you,Uncle De.

65
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,360
Xiaorui.

66
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,080
I have a word of advice for you.

67
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,480
What is it?

68
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,680
Don't worry if you can't figure it out today...

69
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,460
...because tomorrow,...

70
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,200
...it can't be figured out,too.

71
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,720
So you should take your medicine now.

72
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,680
Sleep early. There's some water.

73
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,560
Nakagawa can't even find it with his resources.

74
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,860
By asking us to find it,...

75
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,490
...could this be a trap?

76
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,280
Let me tell you.

77
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,520
No matter how rich Mr. Nakagawa is,...

78
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,040
...does he have the all-seeing eyes?

79
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,600
Why wait for the strange weather?

80
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,080
I found it! We're lucky. The supermoon will occur in two weeks.

81
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,320
Get ready. We'll go into the desert soon.

82
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,200
Great!

83
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,080
Honey. -Miss Xiaojia.

84
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,280
You should've seen...

85
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,080
...the way I rode a camel and defeated them.

86
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,360
Look at you. Stop boasting.

87
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,520
If you don't trust me, just ask them!

88
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:36,030
I braved the sandstorm...

89
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,330
...and saved a life.

90
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,520
You must stay safe. Do you hear me?

91
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,440
I know.

92
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,600
we're not leaving yet. Here,give me a kiss.

93
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,720
I miss you too. Here's a kiss.

94
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,600
Please go to the camel's stable for a video call next time.

95
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,480
No,this is the only thing that makes me happy here.

96
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,530
Aren't you being too cruel?

97
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,760
You are the cruel one.

98
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,640
My Miss Xiaojia...

99
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,760
...is so near yet so far.

100
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,640
Look at him,making us eat dog food everyday.

101
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,280
Who's the cruel one? -What's it to do with me?

102
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,680
Next time,please go to the camel's stable for a video call.

103
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,040
I won't see you off. Thank you. -Xiaorui!

104
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,480
I heard there's an antiques market nearby.

105
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,520
Let's have a look. -I can't go. I'm busy.

106
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,760
Xiaofei,I know you're bored. Why don't we.....

107
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,600
No.

108
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,860
It's about time. Let's go.

109
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,960
Have a look! Sir,have a look!

110
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,440
Accessories! Beautiful accessories!

111
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,960
Come have a look! These are all good stuff!

112
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,680
Look at our porcelain vases! They're good stuff!

113
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,580
Xiaoyun,there's quite a crowd here.

114
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,080
Markets like this sell many fake items.

115
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
This is obviously a fake.

116
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,040
Mr. Yamaki, let's go to other stalls.

117
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
No money and all you do is look!

118
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,040
This place look small but even the Japanese is here.

119
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,100
Let's go there and see what we can get.

120
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,680
Boss.

121
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,200
How may I help you?

122
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,160
What were the Japanese men looking at?

123
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,200
They come here everyday doing nothing.

124
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,850
You don't look happy. Why didn't you sell them anything?

125
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,360
They've never bought anything. They've only haggled the price.

126
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,680
They don't seem poor.

127
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,200
Have a look. -Is the problem with your stock?

128
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,960
That's jade. -This isn't good.

129
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,840
Judging from material and translucency,it's common jade.

130
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,920
It has been chemically enhanced to appear more translucent.

131
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,880
How is it different from glass in old mines?

132
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,140
How could you say that?

133
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,840
This can't do,too. It's not even a jade.

134
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,330
This is an imitation but good enough to cheat the layman.

135
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,800
I can't even spend a single cent. -How could you say that?

136
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,480
Are you here to disrupt my business...

137
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,720
...or are you buying something?

138
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,840
I'll get rid of you. You don't believe me?

139
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,800
Boss,don't get riled up. Your stock is the problem.

140
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,290
Why are you blaming me? Where's the logic?

141
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,800
Logic? It's here. I'm the logic!

142
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,620
Listen up,if you don't buy the bangle today,...

143
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,380
...I won't let this go!

144
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,650
Fine.

145
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,480
Keep the change. What is it?

146
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,360
Do you think my bangle's worth only RMB200?

147
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,560
Brother, RMB200 is more than enough.

148
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,490
You can't leave! Listen here.....

149
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,880
Just talk it out. Don't be physical.

150
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:30,880
You!

151
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,780
Surround them! Don't let them leave!

152
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,100
Please let me through.

153
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,760
Is there a need to be physical in business?

154
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,520
Mr. Lin,just in time. You'll be the judge.

155
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,240
They disrupted my business and wouldn't pay. They asked for it!

156
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,840
You!

157
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,330
Brothers,you seem to have come from the city.

158
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,720
Can't you just talk it out?

159
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,240
You,too. Must you make this a huge matter?

160
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,280
Well..... -I know you have your rules.

161
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,960
Okay,I'll buy the bangle today.

162
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,400
Brothers,let's calm down. Don't blow this up,all right?

163
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,540
Here's RMB500.

164
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,000
Fine. Since Mr. Lin is here,...

165
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,890
...all of you can leave now.

166
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,900
Thank you for helping us. -This can't do.

167
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,480
Well,you can scan my QR code.

168
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,520
I'll transfer money to you. -Never mind.

169
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,640
You two don't look like locals...

170
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,760
...so you had to go through that. You're clearly from the city.

171
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,280
You guessed it well. We're indeed from Beijing.

172
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,480
We're just looking around, hoping to find something good.

173
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,640
I have two good items. Would you like to have a look?

174
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,200
Sure.

175
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,440
Have a look.

176
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,600
It's a Tang Dynasty Sancai camel.

177
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,520
It looks alive and the colour is beautiful.

178
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,500
The lines are drawn with gentle strokes.

179
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,890
It sounds hollow and is aesthetically pleasing.

180
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,320
There's even an earthy smell. -You even know this?

181
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,320
I'm a partner in Ruiyunzhai.

182
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,640
Of course I would know a thing or two.

183
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,520
Lad,you're an expert.

184
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,100
However,from what I know,...

185
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,280
...authentic Tang Dynasty Sancai is rare.

186
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,200
There're no more than 20 pieces in the country.

187
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,040
It's also expensive. Why do you have it?

188
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,980
This has been in my family.

189
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,040
You came here just at the right time.

190
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,420
How much for it?

191
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,680
More listening and seeing, less talking and buying.

192
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,920
Xiaofei,do you know how much this is worth?

193
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,370
According to my calculation, this is worth over RMB10 million.

194
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,810
If I buy this,...

195
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,640
...Xiaojia and Xiaorui will see me differently.

196
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,240
Forget it.

197
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,920
Let Xiaorui have a look. What if you make a mistake?

198
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,280
Impossible! This is authentic.

199
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,320
So? Have you decided?

200
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,920
Well,what's your price?

201
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,490
RMB30 thousand?

202
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,680
RMB3.....

203
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,760
Tens,hundreds,thousands, ten thousands,hundred thousands.

204
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,680
RMB3 million?

205
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,720
Xiaoyun,are you crazy? Why did you spend RMB3 million?

206
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,760
Let me tell me,that money is from my treasury.

207
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,720
I'm saving it for marriage. -If you lose money and marriage?

208
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,200
Watch your mouth.

209
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,320
What you're holding is worth more than RMB3 million.

210
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,280
This is for my future happiness.

211
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,860
I don't want to be responsible for it.

212
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,760
Have some confidence in us rich people.

213
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,920
High risk,high returns. Am I right?

214
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,640
When we return to Beijing, if it sells over RMB10 million,...

215
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,530
...not just my happiness,even your happiness will be guaranteed.

216
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,720
I knew the fake goods seller won't leave us alone.

217
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,650
What do you want?

218
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,600
We're the police. Come with us.

219
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,640
Officer,I'm a good citizen.

220
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,310
You're suspected of reselling cultural relics. Come with us.

221
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,720
No way! -Take them away.

222
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,599
I'm a good citizen. Officer,you got the wrong man.

223
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,400
We've been watching Mr. Lin.

224
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,200
You only surfaced after so long.

225
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,960
No,I've told you already.

226
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,480
I've nothing to do with Mr. Lin.

227
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,480
I was just buying a souvenir.

228
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,170
Besides,he said it's been a family treasure.

229
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,530
How would I know it's a national relic?

230
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,400
I've heard that excuse multiple times.

231
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,000
I'd advice you to think again. Confess and ask for leniency.

232
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,360
Officer Miao.

233
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,960
Lin Zhong is involved in reselling national relics.

234
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,620
We've monitored them for six months.

235
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,640
However, their dealings are discreet.

236
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,320
We made an arrest based on our intelligence.

237
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,440
Your friend made a dealing right at this time.

238
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,760
This makes him the biggest suspect.

239
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,160
Of course,we'll settle this as soon as possible.

240
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,720
From what I know,authentic Tang Dynasty Sancai is rare.

241
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,620
Most of them are fakes.

242
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,520
Xiaoyun must've been cheated.

243
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,340
We've sent this for authentication.

244
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,880
The Tang Dynasty Sancai is indeed authentic.

245
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,480
We're just waiting for the authentication report.

246
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,880
Officer Zhang, the authenticity report is out.

247
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,060
Our department head sent this to you.

248
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:47,960
Thank you.

249
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,080
The design and colour of this Tang Dynasty Sancai...

250
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,010
...are perfect.

251
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,280
Too bad it's only a plain craft.

252
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,640
The results says it's a fake. How can that be?

253
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,490
Xiaorui.

254
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,330
How did you know the Tang Dynasty Sancai is a fake?

255
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,060
They only figured it out after using authentication technology.

256
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,680
Initially,I thought it was authentic,too.

257
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,250
However,I saw the word Feng, carved in simplified Chinese,...

258
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,060
...on the inside of the Tang Dynasty Sancai.

259
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,320
Simplified Chinese couldn't have been carved by ancient Chinese.

260
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,380
So it must be a fake.

261
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,880
So that was it.

262
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,880
Why did you think the person carve the word?

263
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,730
I would've been able to sell it off.

264
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,090
In history, makers of imitation goods...

265
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,160
...were superstitious and afraid of retribution.

266
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,360
So the custom is to leave an imperfection on the fakes.

267
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,280
Why did he carve the word Feng?

268
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,020
He wants to leave his name behind.

269
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,000
It's like saying, look at what I made.

270
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,760
The Feng family made it. -That's strange.

271
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,280
If he wants to be known, why not carve it on the outside?

272
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,960
Who can see if it's on the inside?

273
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,120
People like Xiaorui who can see through things.

274
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,360
How many people have the Golden Eyes?

275
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,240
I believe that this was done...

276
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,960
...to show those that can see it.

277
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,900
Do you mean that the person who made Tang Dynasty Sancai...

278
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,980
...is related to the Golden Eyes?

279
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,520
Hold on. Wasn't it just a carved word?

280
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,800
Why do you make it sound like it's a breakthrough?

281
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,640
If we can find the person who made it,...

282
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,860
...it will answer our questions.

283
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,140
I heard them saying...

284
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,280
...that Mr. Lin dealt with an Old Wu in the black market.

285
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,060
If we find Old Wu,we'll find out about the Tang Dynasty Sancai.

286
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,120
Wait,there's a black market here? Even rats wouldn't be here.

287
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,880
You don't know this. Normally,illegal dealings...

288
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,880
...are done in such places. Old Zeng found this place.

289
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,520
Pengfei, you'll keep watch outside.

290
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,580
Call the police if anything happens.

291
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,240
Be careful. -Let's go.

292
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,280
Stay safe.

293
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,900
Let's go. -Come in.

294
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,930
Sir,have a look.

295
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,340
Brother,look at this.

296
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,050
Brother,look at this skin. It'd make a great accessory.

297
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,920
Have a look.

298
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,220
Brother,have a look. They're cheap.

299
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,280
Purses,handbags, card holders,waist pouch.

300
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,560
Is this a black market? More like a ghost town.

301
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,680
You can find anything here.

302
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,560
They're here at night and are gone in the morning.

303
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,080
What brought them all here?

304
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,200
There are two types of black market.

305
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,720
Firstly,it's the free market without a management.

306
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,450
Secondly,it's the organised market with a boss.

307
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,480
This seems to belong to the latter.

308
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,920
These things are everywhere. I don't like it.

309
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,780
They have everything here. Most of them have unknown origins.

310
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,320
They even sell things that you don't see out there.

311
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,920
However,real items are rare. Fake items are abundant.

312
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,280
Who even shops here?

313
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,800
They have a rule here. Buy,but never ask.

314
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,320
You can have a look and buy anything...

315
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,980
...but you must never ask where it came from.

316
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,760
If you like it,you pay for it.

317
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,080
Once the deal is made, no one can dispute anything.

318
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,240
If you're cheated,it's too bad. Finding a real item...

319
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,180
...depends on you.

320
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,090
Is it that interesting?

321
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,840
However,there are many authentic items,too.

322
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,440
There are people who bought the real deal.

323
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,170
Besides,...

324
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,040
...not only physical items, people trade messages,too.

325
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,810
So in this place,...

326
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,320
...if you can think of it, they have it.

327
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,180
I looked around and find this place quite interesting.

328
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,490
How did you find this place?

329
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,360
Did you come here behind my back?

330
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,120
What were you thinking? I only asked Old Zeng.

331
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,050
Would I have come here unprepared?

332
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,720
What's wrong? -What is it?

333
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,140
I think we're being followed.

334
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,280
There are many people here. We must be careful.

335
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,240
Father,I found Zhuang Rui near the desert.

336
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,640
My men will get there soon.

337
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,720
They have desert experience. You must work with them.

338
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,840
Yes,understood. -If there's anything valuable,...

339
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,080
...give up on Zhuang Rui if necessary.

340
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,600
Isn't Zhuang Rui important to us?

341
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,400
If the secret of the Golden Eyes is there,...

342
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,920
...then he's not useful to us anymore.

343
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,450
Understand?

344
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,360
Sell it to me. -Boss,I'll pay this much.

345
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,720
Boss,look at me. I'll pay this much.

346
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,560
Boss,I'll pay more.

347
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,560
Old Wu's stock has never disappointed me.

348
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,080
Yes,you're a regular customer.

349
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:00,960
That.....

350
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,480
Go take a look.

351
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,440
Boss,I'll pay this much.

352
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,480
You want one,too.

353
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,360
Boss. -Do you feel uncomfortable?

354
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,760
Well,what I want is.....

355
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,240
Actually,I'm here...

356
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,600
...to buy a message. Where did you get...

357
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,640
...this Tang Dynasty Sancai from?

358
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,600
As long as you tell me, you can name your price.

359
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,720
I can name my price?

360
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,560
I don't care what you buy with your money,but...

361
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,320
...you've broken a rule.

362
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,720
Which is never to ask where things come from.

363
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,040
You look unfamiliar so you must be new here.

364
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,360
Young man,I'll let you off...

365
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,720
...but don't meddle in my business. Go!

366
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:11,480
Come,over here.

367
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,880
Leave!

368
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,240
What now? The world has changed. Money is no longer king.

369
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,120
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

370
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,180
They don't buy your method. No matter how much you give.

371
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,200
The sun's coming out.

372
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,200
Boss Wu should be closing his stall now.

373
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,480
We'll wait around and follow him.

374
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,280
No,what if...

375
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,260
...it's the only piece? What if he doesn't restock?

376
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,520
That won't happen. Since the Sancai is a fake...

377
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,080
...but looks like the real deal,...

378
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,440
...he'll mass produce them. He could sell...

379
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,300
...the Tang Dynasty Sancai at a high price within a short time.

380
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,880
I'm sure he will restock.

381
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,450
Let's go.

382
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:15,960
Calm down.

383
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,120
Calm down.

384
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,560
Who are you?

385
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,360
Why are you following me?

386
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,600
We're with the police. You're involved in a fraud.

387
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,160
Come with us.

388
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,040
Fraud?

389
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,080
Where do I start?

390
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,720
You look like fake officers,too.

391
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,680
The Tang Dynasty Sancai is a fake. Isn't that fraud?

392
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,560
How dare you?

393
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,160
My Tang Dynasty Sancai is the real deal.

394
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,970
Everyone here knows it.

395
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,700
I never sell imitation goods.

396
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,360
Are you here to create trouble? Get them!

397
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,880
Wait,what if I can prove that it's an imitation?

398
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:28,000
So bold. How will you prove it? Who do you think you are?

399
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,040
I'm sure you don't know this.

400
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,040
He's the youngest member of the China's Gem Association.

401
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,440
A famous antiques appreciator and collector in the country.

402
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,000
If I can prove that it's an imitation,...

403
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,080
...you'll tell me where your goods came from.

404
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,920
Lad,don't play games with me.

405
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,120
If you're tired of living, I can kill you.

406
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,720
Are you mad? Take them away! -Wait!

407
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,640
How can there be simplified Chinese during the Tang Dynasty?

408
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,920
This..... It's impossible!

409
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,560
You did this on purpose! Kill him!

410
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,520
Stop! -Kill them!

411
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,320
Stop!

412
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,560
No! It's impossible! Give it back to me!

413
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,960
Mr. Li cheated me! -Move!

414
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,840
Mr. Li cheated me! -Behave yourself!

415
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,080
Are you hurt? -I'm all right.

416
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,920
We only slept a while and the sun is already out.

417
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,440
What is it? Do your eyes hurt?

418
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,800
Here's your medicine. You mustn't skip it.

419
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,960
Thank you. -Now you're talking.

420
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,840
You hid behind Xiaorui earlier.

421
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,480
It's because I knew you would protect him.

422
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,000
You didn't need me. Besides,if I had your skills,...

423
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
...you and Xiaofei wouldn't need to do anything.

424
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,840
Speaking of which, will you teach me some moves?

425
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,600
I'd be better equipped to protect Miss Xiaojia.

426
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,600
You should protect yourself first.

427
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,969
Give me a moment.

428
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,670
Hello,Miss Xiaojia.

429
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,320
We're just talking about you and you called.

430
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,760
Doesn't it mean that we have a telepathic love?

431
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,670
Look at you,getting less shameful by the day.

432
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:36,770
You're calling me this early. There must be something.

433
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,150
What is it? You miss me already?

434
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,710
Who's missing you? If you hadn't sent me 10 messages,...

435
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,370
...would I have called you?

436
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,120
Forgive me for disrupting you.

437
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,679
Can I not worry about you?

438
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,840
Do you remember...

439
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,620
...Old Wu mentioning Boss Li last night?

440
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,200
Looks like Boss Li is the one we're looking for.

441
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,480
Come on. Let's get in the car.

442
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,720
What is it? -Do you know what day is today?

443
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,440
What day is it?

444
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,160
Today is our 45th day anniversary.

445
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,000
Miss Xiaojia,charming as ever.

446
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,970
Friend,we're leaving.

447
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,080
Officer Zhang has interrogated Old Wu.

448
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,600
However,Old Wu has little information about Boss Li.

449
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,480
They meet at a place with no contact number.

450
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,920
Their operations are discreet.

451
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,360
They're most afraid of exposing their hiding nest.

452
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,960
So it will be guarded well.

453
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,920
Old Zeng is asking around, there should be news.

454
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,760
Boss Li,what a common name.

455
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,600
It's not unique at all. Any nickname is better than this.

456
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,080
Feifei,you'll ask around for his home address.

457
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,080
You might find some clue.

458
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,690
He's always doing things like this...

459
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,120
...but he's never earned any money.

460
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,000
I've never seen the stock, just this old box.

461
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,800
I was planning to sell one of these as junk.

462
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,840
Here,have a drink. -Well,...

463
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,690
...do you know someone called Boss Li?

464
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,760
I wouldn't know. I don't even see Old Wu often.

465
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,480
Right,have you burned any straw lately?

466
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:46,720
Straw?

467
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,490
We don't practice that here anymore,but rural villages might.

468
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,720
This is Garden Village? More like abandoned village.

469
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,720
Old Zeng said there are five bosses named Li.

470
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,920
There is one in Garden Village.

471
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:40,690
Let's go.

472
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,120
Wait a minute!

473
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,370
What do you think you're doing? Are you wearing that?

474
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,960
If I were Boss Li, I wouldn't entertain you.

475
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,280
How many times have I told you?

476
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,560
We must act like the rich people we are.

477
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,640
So,what do you think? Is it good enough?

478
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,480
This Tang Dynasty Sancai has a plump body and shiny glaze.

479
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,480
It's beautiful.

480
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,920
You're an expert.

481
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,400
An expert,indeed. -Fine,I'll buy this.

482
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,290
Do you have more?

483
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,040
We don't have much this year.
