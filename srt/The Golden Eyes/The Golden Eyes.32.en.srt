1
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,000
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 32

3
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,800
How is Zhuang Rui doing?

4
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,200
Zhuang Rui? He's not doing too well.

5
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,240
No,wait a minute. What do you mean?

6
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,440
He fainted while we were in the tomb.

7
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,440
He fainted? What happened?

8
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,520
He felt uncomfortable when we were in the tomb...

9
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,479
...and fainted.

10
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:02,840
Is it that serious? -He's all right now.

11
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,440
You don't have to worry. -Nonsense!

12
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,580
He's my grandson, how can I not worry?

13
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,330
Why didn't you inform me earlier?

14
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,730
How could you not tell me such huge matter?

15
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,530
Listen here. You must immediately inform me of such things.

16
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,640
Yes,Zhuang Rui is your grandson and I'm adopted,okay?

17
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,050
All right,you should rest. I'm meeting Professor Meng.

18
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,740
I'm hanging up.

19
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,360
He fainted?

20
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,160
This is a common Tamamoku stone.

21
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,079
This was carved as eyes in the past.

22
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,720
Professor,we made another round of land survey...

23
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,920
...and analysed the results but came up with nothing.

24
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,520
I have reported the underground situation...

25
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,040
...to my grandfather. He said that...

26
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,520
...we could have missed a hidden tomb.

27
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,760
Hidden tomb?

28
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,480
Impossible. According to the scan results,we missed nothing.

29
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,860
Since Mr. Gu thinks so,...

30
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,200
...let us carry out another metal detection test.

31
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,000
It looks like we were mistaken.

32
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,610
Have a look here.

33
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,560
Doesn't the soil at the bottom look odd?

34
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,360
It looks like backfill soil. -Backfill soil?

35
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,920
So that was it.

36
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,930
We've explored all corners of the coffin.

37
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,260
However,there might be a new tomb...

38
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,210
...underneath the coffin.

39
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,180
Or else,there wouldn't be backfill soil in the ground.

40
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,880
Professor,look. There seems to be water at the bottom.

41
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,610
Xiaoren,get the suction machine. -Okay.

42
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:16,040
Your grandfather is good. There really is a tomb underneath.

43
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,040
You did it! -Me?

44
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,040
Brother Ba Te'er,you make excellent butter tea!

45
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,250
I knew you would be here.

46
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,680
Have a seat. Come.

47
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,680
I have the best on the grassland.

48
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,440
Well,I don't want any.

49
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,120
Here you go. -I.....

50
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,460
Have some. -I.....

51
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,320
Have some. It tastes great.

52
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,500
You must have completely recovered.

53
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,460
Running all the way here. -Here,help yourself.

54
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,970
Well,Brother Ba Te'er have told me...

55
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,800
...that you were in danger because of me.

56
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,200
It's because they see me as a threat and an easy target.

57
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,980
Even if you're not ill, they would've got to you anyway.

58
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,880
Drink up. -Have some.

59
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,960
How are things with Professor Meng and the rest?

60
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,340
They are still exploring.

61
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,960
So was anything found upon opening the coffin?

62
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,520
There was no corpse in the coffin...

63
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,040
...but there was a jade chess.

64
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,280
Jade chess?

65
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,360
Young man,you just recovered. What's the rush?

66
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,000
Professor,I'm all well. Do you think I can.....

67
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,080
Yes,you can. Here, a picture of the jade chess.

68
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,240
We've made another 3D scan on the excavation site.

69
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,680
Does this mean that...

70
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,400
...the tomb has two layers? -Yes,according to the results.

71
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,080
It's as we expected. This time,we have found...

72
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,610
...a tomb within a tomb. -A tomb within a tomb?

73
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,160
I've never heard of it. -Not only you,...

74
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,680
...since I started archaeological work,...

75
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,610
...this is my first time seeing such tomb structure.

76
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,040
However,there's something else,too.

77
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,680
This.....

78
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,980
This tomb is circular.

79
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,410
That is what I meant.

80
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,160
What's odd with it being circular?

81
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,720
Our ancestors make round tombs and square lands...

82
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,920
...so most tombs are either square or rectangle in shape.

83
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,260
It is circular but not completely round.

84
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,560
Look at that, it's shaped like an eye.

85
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,400
A tomb shaped like an eye?

86
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,520
Professor Meng, when will we go down again?

87
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,360
All of you,make preparations. Come with me.

88
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,080
Come.

89
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,080
Look,this is a rare shape for a tomb.

90
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,360
You will stay up here this time.

91
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,120
I will inform you of the situation down there.

92
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,450
Professor Meng,I.....

93
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,160
You felt uncomfortable for both times that we went down.

94
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,020
No matter what you say, I'll not allow you this time.

95
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,040
Professor Meng,the excitement of a new archaeological find...

96
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,680
...is akin to an astronaut landing on the moon.

97
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,080
Do you understand that? I need this.

98
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,340
You're young,there's no need to risk your life.

99
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,080
However,if I don't go this time,...

100
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,160
...I'm afraid I'll regret this.

101
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,360
You!

102
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,520
Young man,...

103
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,760
...you're like my younger self. -Does it mean you agree to it?

104
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:21,000
If you feel any discomfort, you must go up.

105
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,480
We have a deal.

106
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,400
Let's go.

107
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,120
We've agreed. You'll go up if you feel discomfort.

108
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,580
Feifei will surely have something to say to you.

109
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,640
Here,take it slow.

110
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,900
Feifei and Xiaogu!

111
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,040
Why is he here? -I'm here.

112
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,360
Professor, how did he persuade you?

113
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,360
I'm no match for him. So persistent!

114
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,600
Feifei,don't worry. -How can I not worry?

115
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,460
I will not let you enter this time.

116
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,920
It was because of mercury last time.

117
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,960
This time, I have prepared myself.

118
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,840
Besides,with all of you here, I'll be fine.

119
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,000
You..... -Professor,...

120
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,250
...we're ready and it's getting late.

121
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,370
Let's no delay this and get moving.

122
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,640
Let's get moving.

123
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,440
Watch your steps. -Watch your feet.

124
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,960
There really is a stone door.

125
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,440
According to scan results, there is something behind it.

126
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,930
Then what is behind the stone door?

127
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,360
It should be the real entrance to the tomb.

128
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,160
Hurry and open up using a stone crusher.

129
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,840
No,we have just sucked out the water in the tomb.

130
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,360
There were signs of collapse so we can't use machines.

131
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,720
There's another entrance.

132
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,440
This is a chess board.

133
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,780
There are two rows of words beside it.

134
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,210
Black and white make a move, never moving backwards.

135
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,000
When Yin-Yang comes together, it will come to an end.

136
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,200
What does it mean?

137
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,640
Professor Meng,the jade chess that you found earlier,...

138
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,000
...can I take look at it? -The jade chess is a relic.

139
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,340
Do you think you can see it just like that?

140
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,770
The jade chess was found in the coffin on the upper level.

141
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,680
It should be the key to opening this door.

142
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,400
Give it to me. -Xiaoren,give it to him.

143
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,320
Gently.

144
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,000
The jade chess doesn't seem to be the key.

145
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,360
You're right.

146
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,880
This is an incomplete game of chess.

147
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,760
Only by completing this round of chess...

148
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,280
...can it be opened. -Yes.

149
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,840
In an incomplete game of chess, both side have a winning chance.

150
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:45,280
Look,these two rows must be spare chess pieces.

151
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,240
However,there are many ways to end the game.

152
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,920
Which one will open this stone door?

153
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:15,000
I believe these two rows of words...

154
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,849
...are the key to solving this chess game.

155
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:26,000
Black and white make a move, never moving backwards.

156
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,450
When Yin-Yang comes together, it will come to an end.

157
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,960
Xiaozhuang,end the game with him. -Okay.

158
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,650
You chose black so you start first.

159
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,640
By making that move,...

160
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,720
...you won't result in a draw.

161
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,400
I get it now.

162
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,840
I'm surprised you know how to play chess.

163
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:51,240
Goodness, the strange feeling is back.

164
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,800
Wait a minute.

165
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,240
Zhuang Rui! -Zhuang Rui!

166
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,200
Zhuang Rui,are you all right? -What's with you?

167
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,880
You're sweating. Why don't you rest?

168
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,360
No need,we're almost there.

169
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,480
One more move left. I'm fine.

170
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,240
Continue.

171
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,180
Zhuang Rui,are you all right?

172
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,120
It's a draw.

173
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,120
Zhuang Rui

174
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,160
Zhuang Rui.

175
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,120
Are you feeling unwell? -What is it?

176
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,300
We must be careful.

177
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,400
Be careful.

178
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,170
Professor Meng,...

179
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,480
...why do these bronzeware look like they've fallen?

180
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,400
It's been over two thousand years so the earth crust have shifted.

181
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,720
This is normal. -Over two thousand years?

182
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,760
Yes. Everyone,listen up!

183
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,360
These relics are over 2,000 years old so be careful.

184
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,840
There isn't much deposit of bronzeware from the Qin Dynasty.

185
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,160
So coming here is a huge gain.

186
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,680
Professor Meng,Qin Dynasty lasted less than 20 years.

187
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,600
You can ascertain the time period of these bronzeware?

188
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,730
This ancient coin is called Ban Liang.

189
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,610
Before the Warring States period, Ban Liang weighs 3 to 5 grams.

190
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,160
After the unification, Ban Liang weighs about 8 grams.

191
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,420
ALthough Ban Liang was used until early Han Dynasty but...

192
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,960
...according to the pit outside,...

193
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,580
...the big figure is Qin and the small one is Han.

194
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,920
From these two observations, we can deduce that...

195
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,800
...this tomb is build after the war of unification,...

196
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,650
...before the Han Dynasty.

197
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,240
Did you find anything?

198
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,600
There is something odd about the wall paintings.

199
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,480
It looks like..... -What does it look like?

200
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,810
Wall paintings in tombs...

201
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,320
...are usually done by artisans.

202
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,850
However,the wall paintings here don't look like...

203
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,440
...they're drawn by artisan. They're coarsely drawn.

204
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,300
It looks like the work of a single person.

205
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,000
Furthermore,wall paintings in ancient tombs...

206
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,840
....usually tell a story.

207
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,000
They are either praises for the dead...

208
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,240
...or blessings for reincarnation.

209
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,560
However, the wall paintings here.....

210
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,440
Look,there's a path. Let's check it out.

211
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,320
Let's go. -All right.

212
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:41,810
Let's go.

213
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,120
Listen up,when the coffin is opened,...

214
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,250
...don't go near it.

215
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,920
Due to a lack of airflow in the coffin,...

216
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,200
...the changes in air and humidity...

217
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,440
...will cause the relics to decompose.

218
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,080
Especially when handling the tomb master's corpse.

219
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,480
We must be cautious,understand?

220
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,200
Understood. -Good. We'll open the coffin.

221
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,520
Hello. -Xiaorui.

222
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,320
Why do you keep making us worry?

223
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,640
We called you all day but you didn't pick up.

224
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,840
Feifei didn't pick up,too. I thought you were in trouble.

225
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,040
Perhaps the reception where Feifei and I isn't good.

226
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,570
I'm all right now,aren't I?

227
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,280
Why did you fall ill again?

228
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,920
Liu Jia's checking flight tickets. We're going there tomorrow.

229
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,690
Why would you come here?

230
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,120
Xiaorui, if you feel unwell again,...

231
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,800
...you must tell us immediately. Don't keep it to yourself.

232
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,200
You should go to the hospital. -Yes,we'll wait for you.

233
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,260
We'll take you to the hospital for a full body check-up.

234
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,200
Yes,health is important. -All right.

235
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,800
Xiaorui,don't wear yourself out.

236
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,560
Although doing archaeological work is an honour for you,...

237
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,120
...you mustn't risk yourself each time.

238
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,680
Okay,I'll remember your advice.

239
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,660
I'll take good care of myself.

240
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,440
You must take care of yourself for our sake.

241
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,600
Both of us want to thank you.

242
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,720
So I've decided to serenade you with a song.

243
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,680
Xiaorui,I love you. You can never escape...

244
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,800
...the fire in your heart.

245
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,920
There's nothing to worry when we've turned into ashes.

246
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,520
What is pain? What is hurt?

247
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,120
Perseverance is what you need in love.

248
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:56,280
You can never hide love that is meant to be.

249
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,120
Thank you.

250
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,080
Why did you end it?

251
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,580
I was serenading Xiaorui!

252
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,600
Who are you?

253
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,040
I should ask you that.

254
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,380
You're the author of The Life of Feng.

255
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,560
2,000 years ago,...

256
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,760
...the man who has the Golden Eye,Feng Quan.

257
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,980
You know about the Golden Eye?

258
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,040
I also know that...

259
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,739
...that the Golden Eye...

260
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:55,320
...made a nobody like you into somebody.

261
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,920
You became known overnight.

262
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,000
Power,wealth,...

263
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,840
...and everything else, you have them all.

264
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,160
Am I right?

265
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,560
Aren't you the same,too?

266
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,520
The rare treasures here belong to you during your lifetime.

267
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,210
Why did you bring them here?

268
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,880
If this is your tomb, why can't we find your corpse?

269
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,160
You know quite a lot.

270
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,120
What else do you want to know?

271
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,040
I want to know the secret of the Golden Eye.

272
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,090
You wouldn't want to know that.

273
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,680
What's wrong?

274
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,320
It's nothing.

275
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,400
How long have I slept? -Around 4 to 5 hours.

276
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,000
Are you hungry? I bring some food for you.

277
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,800
4 to 5 hours? Have you been by my side?

278
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,260
You acted strangely these 2 days. Professor Meng was worried.

279
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,120
She also told me to inform her when you're awake.

280
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,050
What are you doing? -I want to see.....

281
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,120
I want to see.....

282
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,220
I want to see the file on Tomb No.1.

283
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,720
If you want to do that, you have to rest.

284
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,840
Professor Meng should still be awake by now.

285
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,880
I'll give her a call to send the file here.

286
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,640
Feifei. -Professor.

287
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,960
Can you send me information on the Qin tomb?

288
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,880
Information on the Qin tomb?

289
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,240
Xiaoli and Xiaozhang is asleep. -It's all right then.

290
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,640
No,I have the key to the file cabinet.

291
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,280
Is it far from you? -No,it's not.

292
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,600
It's near. -Sorry for troubling you.

293
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,960
All right. -Thank you,professor.

294
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,920
I'll get it for you. Wait for me.

295
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:43,930
Who's there?

296
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,880
What was that sound? -It sounded like Professor Meng.

297
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,810
I'll take a look.

298
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,180
I'll come with you.

299
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,840
Professor! -Professor Meng!

300
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,280
Professor! -Professor Meng!

301
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:02,940
Professor!

302
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,480
Feifei,the information. Where's the file?

303
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,960
The information..... -Let's go to the doctor.

304
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,160
Okay,let's go. -Wait a minute.

305
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:18,960
Let's go.

306
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,320
How is Professor Meng doing?

307
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:14,520
The doctor said it's not serious. She'll be fine after resting.

308
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,570
I think last night was an accident.

309
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,610
The tent was not lit so she hit herself on the head.

310
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,240
That's possible. -No.

311
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:26,930
Look at this.

312
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,960
It's a broken shard from a camera flash.

313
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,040
I found this on the ground.
