1
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,990
The Golden Eyes

2
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,990
Episode 1

3
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,180
Zhuang Rui,

4
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,520
let's take a picture.

5
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,720
Okay.

6
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,530
Okay,

7
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,329
let me edit that for you.

8
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,000
I don't have my phone with me.

9
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,760
Well,looks like...

10
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,640
...we have a reunion here.

11
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,560
Make some room for me.

12
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,680
If you don't have your phone, that means no pictures,right?

13
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,200
Just share it later.

14
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,640
What a beautiful face in the photo! Clever boy!

15
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,440
One more shot.

16
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,480
Good.

17
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,930
If there aren't photos,... ...did the reunion even happen?

18
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,950
Which one is you,Zhuang Rui?

19
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,560
The one furthest to the left.

20
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,090
This one?

21
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,010
Liu Chang Fa,

22
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,760
a civil official like you...

23
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,280
...on his phone in the office all day.

24
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,400
How much more can you play with your phone?

25
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,000
You think it is easy being me?

26
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,200
I'm burning out!

27
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,760
There are four of us.

28
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,800
3 of them just laze around.

29
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:42,520
The only good things about the job are the benefits.

30
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,640
I'll be able to save up some money before 30.

31
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,760
Foreign companies are still the best.

32
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,000
Good environment,

33
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,800
good pay,

34
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,440
right?

35
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,840
I think Yue has it the easiest. Right,Yue?

36
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,370
My dad insists on having me take over his company.

37
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,480
I have hundreds of people depending on me every day.

38
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,960
I'll be happy not to throw it all away...

39
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,480
...by the time I'm 30.

40
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,890
Zhuang Rui,that pawn shop of yours isn't too shabby either.

41
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,400
It's a good professional fit.

42
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,460
What's the career progression like?

43
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,040
There isn't really any room for growth.

44
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,800
I might make some money if all goes well though.

45
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,200
You must have to stay strong,brother.

46
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,560
Beijing will be yours one day.

47
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,240
Let's not talk about this and sing.

48
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,840
Let's go.

49
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,320
Get up.

50
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,360
Our ride is here. We'll be going now.

51
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:16,960
Bye bye.

52
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,640
Bye bye.

53
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,840
Where's Yue? -He left already.

54
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,800
He has called us a cab. It's over there.

55
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,200
How about you,Zhuang Rui?

56
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,400
You guys go ahead.

57
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,320
I'll manage. -Alright. We're leaving.

58
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,240
Bye bye. -Bye bye.

59
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,440
Beijing University History Department Alumni Reunion.

60
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,200
Boss,the door is unlocked.

61
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,200
Boss,no one is inside.

62
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,200
Who is it?

63
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,320
Get rid of him.

64
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,040
Stop. Who said you could fire?

65
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,320
Boss,the cops will be here soon. Let's hurry up and leave.

66
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,680
Quick! -Move it.

67
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,160
Hurry! -Faster.

68
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,680
He saw us. -Morning.

69
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,920
Don't he has gauze on?

70
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,620
He has special powers?

71
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,320
Can you do it?

72
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,000
Yes. -You don't need help.

73
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,400
What help?

74
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,480
Male toilet

75
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,120
This can't be.

76
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,060
Who said you could take off the dressing?

77
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,490
You're pretty ballsy,aren't you?

78
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:17,430
Let me see.

79
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,760
Good. You're coming along nicely.

80
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,940
If there aren't any complications, you may be discharged.

81
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,240
I'm telling you, if this wound...

82
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,360
...was a couple inches closer to your eyes,you'd be blind by now.

83
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,720
Doctor,have we met before?

84
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,160
Why do you sound so familiar?

85
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,880
Have you been here before? You haven't,right?

86
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,400
I'm telling you,almost all my patients don't recover.

87
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,840
Are you sure I sound familiar?

88
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,600
Can you take off your mask and show me your face?

89
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,360
Sure. Look.

90
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,200
Surprised?

91
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,720
Don't you think I look like...

92
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,960
...that TV actor?

93
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,970
That's it. The one who's always playing the villain.

94
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,760
Everyone in the lab says I do.

95
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,560
You look more like a singer to me.

96
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,280
That's enough messing around.

97
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,680
Go make payment. Do you have a medical card?

98
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,560
That's not it. My eyes just don't feel right.

99
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,480
Can you make it better?

100
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,080
It's fine. I just looked at it.

101
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,320
By the way,...

102
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,340
...now that I have just undressed your eyes,...

103
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,200
...your vision might be a little blurred.

104
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,940
That's not it. Things are a little too clear.

105
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,440
Isn't that a good thing?

106
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,740
That just proves that your eyes are fine.

107
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,810
Can I go back to the way I was before?

108
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,120
What do you mean? You want to see things less clearly?

109
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,450
Sure. That's easy to do.

110
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,800
You can read lying down...

111
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,360
...at night with the lights off.

112
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,040
Play with your phone more.

113
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,840
When you are watching TV,get as close to the screen as possible.

114
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,640
Isn't it easy?

115
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,700
Is something wrong with you,kid?

116
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,960
You're trying to deteriorate your own vision.

117
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,720
It's way too clear.

118
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,040
Boss,he's not a suspect...

119
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,400
...but a victim.

120
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,500
Can't you be a little nicer to him?

121
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,890
If you interrogate him today, Sir Ding won't be pleased.

122
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,040
I haven't even done anything.

123
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,090
What have I done?

124
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,320
I came here to see him.

125
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,520
I even brought a gift for him.

126
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,280
You,wait for me here. -Sister......

127
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,130
Detective Miao Fei Fei.

128
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,930
Looks like you really are a cop.

129
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,280
I came here to see you.

130
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,700
Must you do it this way?

131
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,280
I even brought a gift. Take it.

132
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,290
It's washed. You can eat it.

133
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,400
It's bad.

134
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,880
How do you know if you haven't eaten it?

135
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,360
Even so,you still have to eat it.

136
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,280
What's wrong with you? -Eat it.

137
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,890
I told you so.

138
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,240
Well,officer.

139
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,160
You may leave if there's nothing else.

140
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,400
You have to catch the criminals!

141
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,120
Let me tell you how we do things around here.

142
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:53,960
When you you scratch my back, I scratch yours.

143
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,930
You may or may not...

144
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,520
...understand what that means.

145
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,400
It means that if you provide us a useful lead...

146
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,840
...and we apprehend the criminals.

147
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,800
What lead?

148
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,880
I have already told you everything I know.

149
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,560
There were 3 armed men wearing masks.

150
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,560
They were very quick. That's it.

151
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,580
Zhuang Rui.

152
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,490
You're still young.

153
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,650
You still have a bright future if you think this through.

154
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,880
Don't let your emotions ruin your future.

155
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,330
Come.

156
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,360
I'll give you another chance.

157
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,440
What were you up to that night?

158
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,040
I went to the karaoke with my friends. The karaoke.

159
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:00,600
How did you get there? -How? I took the subway.

160
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,520
What time did it end? -Around 11 pm.

161
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,730
Why did you go back to the pawnshop after that?

162
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,050
I left my phone there,officer.

163
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,560
Why did you need your phone? -Why? Because I needed to use it.

164
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,760
What for? -To send photos to my friends.

165
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,400
What photos? -Just some private photos.

166
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,240
Then how did you get back to the pawnshop?

167
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,450
I walked. -Why didn't you take the subway?

168
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,020
The subway had already stopped running.

169
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,440
I wanted to call a cab but I didn't have my phone.

170
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,480
How were you going to share your photos without your phone?

171
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,640
That's why I went back to the pawnshop,officer.

172
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,050
What a coincidence.

173
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,140
You went to a reunion without your phone.

174
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,450
Then right after the reunion you just had to share...

175
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,080
...some photos with them.

176
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,840
The moment you entered the shop...

177
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,410
...there just happened to be a robbery taking place.

178
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,960
Was it really a coincidence? -It was.

179
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,820
Zhuang Rui.

180
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,740
Don't think you got lucky.

181
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,860
There are consequences when you lie.

182
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,240
That's not it,officer. Why would I lie?

183
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,680
A lie only leads to even more lies.

184
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,320
Must we really do this? I'm an honest guy.

185
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,160
Also,they almost killed me.

186
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,880
That's why I want to understand.

187
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,460
They're trying to get rid of the witness. Isn't it obvious?

188
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,960
Isn't it bad? Don't eat it.

189
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,840
According to Zhuang Rui,...

190
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,160
...the robbers arrived...

191
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,840
...3 minutes after he opened the doors.

192
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,160
The robbery took less than 5 minutes.

193
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,560
How efficient.

194
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,360
Tell me.

195
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,720
Do you think it's possible without someone on the inside?

196
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,020
Would you believe me if I told you he wasn't the mole?

197
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,360
I don't believe it at all.

198
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,960
The thing is they never tried to break through...

199
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,900
...the security gate or the safe.

200
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,410
All they did was look around in the lobby for a bit.

201
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,400
The stranger thing is...

202
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,760
...if Zhuang Rui was really a mole,...

203
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,240
...why was everything in the shop mostly untouched?

204
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Sister,take a look.

205
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,650
What is this?

206
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,920
They did a lot of damage...

207
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,720
...but only the contents of this display case was untouched.

208
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,360
The manager said that it was worthless though.

209
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,570
Take it to the lab technicians and see what they can find.

210
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,000
Boss,I've looked through the security footage.

211
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,720
It was untempered with.

212
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,560
Was this robbery a spontaneous one?

213
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,000
We won't be working this case anyway. Forget it.

214
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,160
Do it. You must.

215
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,090
As long as there's a crime, we're on it.

216
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,480
Yes.

217
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:09,880
Miao Fei Fei!

218
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,120
Sir Ding.

219
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:19,880
You've only been quiet for a few days.

220
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,600
Why are you back at it again?

221
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,040
The head of the Second Division just left me...

222
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,640
...about 5 or 6 complaints about you.

223
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,840
Hand this case over to the Second Division.

224
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,640
Focus on the antique theft case.

225
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,720
But,I..... -You can't keep working...

226
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,180
...on other people's cases. -I understand.

227
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,880
You're right.

228
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,120
I'm only pursuing this case because I found a lead.

229
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,920
I even put the report on your desk this morning. Did you not see it?

230
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,560
Did you? -It's alright.

231
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,960
You're always busy so it's fine you haven't read it.

232
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,220
However,I am officially requesting...

233
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,320
...that the antique theft case and this pawnshop robbery...

234
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,880
...be investigated as a single case.

235
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,740
You have a lead?

236
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,500
Today,the lab technicians just completed the ballistics analysis.

237
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,040
The ammunition used at the pawnshop...

238
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,080
...and the ammunition used by the tomb raiders...

239
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,360
...came from the same source.

240
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,920
The bullet casings left behind at the scene is proof of that.

241
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:19,680
I also suspect that there must be a reason...

242
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,640
...why there was a sudden change in their MO.

243
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,320
We need to get to the bottom of this as fast as we can...

244
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,850
...and prepare ourselves for what's to come.

245
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,360
Do you have a plan?

246
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,520
The employee at the pawnshop is the only witness we have.

247
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,680
I plan on using him to solve the case.

248
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,720
If that's the case, follow up on your lead.

249
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,500
I'll handle the Second Division. -Thank you,Sir Ding.

250
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,290
Enough with the pleasantries.

251
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,020
Give me the noodle.

252
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:09,840
Elder Yu.

253
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,640
Enjoying your drink?

254
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,480
We lost men.

255
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,860
The failure of this mission is all our fault.

256
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,300
I don't want the money.

257
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,520
This was really unlucky.

258
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,360
A small shop like that doesn't have security measures.

259
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,800
Who knew that there would be someone in the shop...

260
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,400
...at that time of the night?

261
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,340
My men were afraid. That's why they opened fire.

262
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,320
What was it... ...that scared you all like this?

263
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,960
You aren't afraid of the dead, why would you be afraid of a man?

264
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,480
Brother Mang,...

265
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,280
...we don't really have much experience with this.

266
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,640
We're fine with tomb raiding.

267
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,680
It's what we're good at.

268
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,440
But this is robbery.....

269
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,690
Enough blabbering.

270
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,740
Where is it?

271
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,560
It was broken in the crossfire.

272
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,240
Broke?

273
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,360
If you really like it, I'll get another one for you.

274
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,320
I'll pay for it regardless...

275
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:43,040
...but broken or not, I still want it.

276
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,520
Thank you for your hard work,Zhuang.

277
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,040
Director Liu,this is.....

278
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,400
This is just a token of our appreciation.

279
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,600
Having you resign sounds better than being fired,right?

280
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,040
Zhuang Rui...

281
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,620
...was referred into this company by me.

282
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,080
Exactly. It is only because you referred him...

283
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,210
...that we're only having him resign.

284
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,480
The company is even offering a severance package.

285
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,560
Uncle De,you know the cops will come asking around.

286
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,160
"Why did he open the doors for the robbers?"

287
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,720
I can't figure it out myself.

288
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,560
Because you referred him...

289
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,600
...and because we trust you, we also trust him.

290
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,920
Zhuang,please accept this. Take it.

291
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,160
You know how much we value character in this field.

292
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,060
It's a business after all.

293
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,020
I'm really sorry,Zhuang.

294
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,480
The most important thing in a man is to be straight and just.

295
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,880
Look at Uncle De.

296
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,400
He's a perfect example of that.

297
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,440
Young people should really learn from him.

298
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,170
Director Liu,you're too kind.

299
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,160
Thank you for taking care of Zhuang all this while.

300
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,200
A young man like you should cheer up.

301
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,620
There's plenty of other opportunities.

302
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,440
Zhuang,all you have are opportunities in the future.

303
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:41,840
Zhuang.

304
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,480
Uncle De,take care.

305
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,320
Uncle De.

306
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,920
Uncle De,can you take a look at this for me?

307
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,120
Do you think it's from the Ming or Qing Dynasty?

308
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,360
When the Ming Dynasty fell... ...and when the Qing Dynasty rose is hard to pinpoint.

309
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,520
Look at this.

310
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,640
Rui.

311
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,640
Are you okay? -I'm fine,Uncle De.

312
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:44,120
I'm really sorry about today. Having you come out here for me.

313
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,600
Smooth. There's hope for you yet.

314
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,660
Looks like this wasn't a wasted year for you.

315
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,480
Here,put this on.

316
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,710
Everyone has bad times. You just have to ride it out.

317
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:41,440
This is your thing. I can't accept this.

318
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:45,000
It's not worth much. Think of it as a lucky charm.

319
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,960
Be a good boy and take it.

320
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,870
It'll bring you luck.

321
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,320
Thank you,Uncle De.

322
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,230
What are your plans?

323
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,920
I might start my own business.

324
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,240
No matter what, I'll give it my all.

325
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,240
Good.

326
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,560
That's a great idea.

327
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,570
If we're talking business,...

328
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,450
...it should be a part of the sharing economy.

329
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,640
That's a sure fire way to make money.

330
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,040
The essence of the sharing economy...

331
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,740
...is the transfer of power from the business owners to the users.

332
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,680
Do you think this is a new idea?

333
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:43,960
Of course not.

334
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,320
Actually, landlords have that kind of power.

335
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,210
People like us who couldn't afford houses before...

336
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,240
...obviously can't afford them now. Right?

337
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,800
Without rooms for rent,...

338
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,960
...we would be living on the streets.

339
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,240
How much debt are you in?

340
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,080
Around RMB200,000. -RMB200,000?

341
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,680
However,this temporary setback...

342
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,320
...is not an indictment of the sharing economy as a whole.

343
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,250
This is the way the world works now.

344
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,260
The faster you enter the market, the sooner you'll make money.

345
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,640
Get rid of those historical books you're reading now.

346
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,210
Let's start a business.

347
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,140
What have you shared? Why do people hate you so much?

348
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,760
Rui,you've changed.

349
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,020
Since when do you like rubbing salt on my wounds?

350
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,920
You're lucky we're best friends.

351
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,010
I was going to...

352
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:59,080
...bring you in on this...

353
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,250
...but I didn't think you were even worse off than me.

354
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,180
Then what do you plan to do?

355
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,000
What else can I do? Start over again!

356
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,810
First things first.

357
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,600
Clear off my debts.

358
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,480
That's good. I don't want to be bringing dumplings...

359
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,460
...to you in prison over the New Year.

360
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,040
Actually,I have a plan.

361
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,480
For people who do what we do, debt is endless.

362
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,480
Some 80-year-old customer pawned it here.

363
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,120
Told me it was a family heirloom.

364
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,560
It's worth at least RMB100,000. Maybe more.

365
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,400
Why don't we...

366
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,440
...sell this off?

367
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,960
You studied History,right? Take a look.

368
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,320
Didn't you study History? Look at it.

369
00:38:16,320 --> 00:39:18,280
How about it? -It's pretty much worthless.

370
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:19,960
What?

371
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,200
What are you saying?

372
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,900
How long have you worked there? Why do you have such poor taste?

373
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,080
I think this is really valuable.

374
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,360
It'll fetch a hefty sum of money.

375
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,720
When we get the money, let's pay off your rent...

376
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,920
...as well as my debts first.

377
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:45,040
Coming back from the brink. That's us.
