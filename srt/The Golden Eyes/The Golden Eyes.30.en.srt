1
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,000
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 30

3
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,759
Encore!

4
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,520
Go have a dance. -Go yourself. I'm not going.

5
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,000
Awesome,Xiaoming!

6
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,480
Thank you!

7
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,600
Don't fuss!

8
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,360
Don't pull me. -Encore!

9
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,800
Come,Ba Te'er. A toast to you.

10
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,560
I can drink the wine but I won't agree to do it.

11
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,480
Ba Te'er,what will it take for you to agree to it?

12
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,280
Dr. Ren and Professor Meng have already explained it.

13
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,680
You've seen it yourself. What you're worried about...

14
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,480
...will definitely not happen.

15
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,160
If you need my help,okay.

16
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,820
However,it'll have to be on my terms.

17
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,090
What do you mean?

18
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,280
Prove to me that you're a true warrior.

19
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,880
A true warrior?

20
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,480
Come on.

21
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,600
Ding Yu! -Xiaoyu!

22
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:04,960
Ding Yu!

23
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,600
Get up. -Xiaogu,get up.

24
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,530
What's it with you? -I'm all right.

25
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,440
It's going to be very difficult to defeat him.

26
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,760
This is preposterous. Is this how you treat your guests?

27
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,520
County Head,we served the guests good wine and good meat.

28
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,000
It's just a little activity to help with the digestion.

29
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,680
Be quiet!

30
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,640
I can't do it. -Get up. Don't give up.

31
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,120
Get up. -Slowly.

32
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,440
Are you all right?

33
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,540
What are you doing?

34
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,640
Will you agree to become our guide if I defeat you?

35
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,240
Xiaomiao,ignore him. This chap relies on brute force.

36
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,080
He just loves to wrestle. You're guests from Beijing.

37
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,920
What will we do if you get injured?

38
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,400
He's a real stubborn mule.

39
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,159
It's your job to be a guide. You have to do it.

40
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,490
County Head Zhao,move aside. I know how to deal with him.

41
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,660
Are you doing this or not? Give me a definite answer.

42
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,560
You're real gutsy but I don't fight with little girls.

43
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,800
The number one wrestler in the grasslands...

44
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,560
...surrenders even before the fight starts.

45
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,280
Watch it. Don't risk your life.

46
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,840
Girl,you're too wild. Let me be your opponent instead.

47
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,000
You?

48
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,120
Is he scared?

49
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,580
Ba Te'er's afraid he'll accidentally kill you.

50
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,280
If you're afraid, it's not too late to admit defeat.

51
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:35,960
Come on,then!

52
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,360
All of you go back. I'll be fine. -Officer Miao.

53
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,000
Go easy on the girl.

54
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,400
Come on!

55
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,330
You're really letting her?

56
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,460
Why is Xiaomiao so stubborn? She's worse than Ba Te'er.

57
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,840
Will she be okay? -Don't worry. She's trained.

58
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,160
She knows what to do.

59
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,500
She clearly had the upper hand. Why did she back off?

60
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,200
She's luring him into a mistake. -Luring him?

61
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,200
Wrestling doesn't rely on brute force but observation.

62
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,090
To look for the right opportunity.

63
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,320
Watch,here's her chance.

64
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,960
Let me do it.

65
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,260
Interesting. You made me sit up and take notice.

66
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,720
Come,let's continue.

67
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,620
Come on.

68
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,120
Feifei's amazing. She'll defeat Ba Te'er,right?

69
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,480
Feifei has the speed.

70
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,680
It's just that Ba Te'er's too big in size.

71
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,760
Ba Te'er's formidable.

72
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,000
Strange,Ba Te'er actually has the upper hand from the get go.

73
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,450
I wonder why did he.....

74
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,810
I never expected a girl like you to take so many of my attacks.

75
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,000
I like you. I want to marry you.

76
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,160
Did I hear correctly?

77
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,680
I'll be your guide if you're willing to marry me.

78
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,400
How about it? Isn't this killing two birds with one stone?

79
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,930
Ba Te'er,stop it with your nonsense already!

80
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,610
Since they lost,they can stop bothering me about being a guide.

81
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,320
I'll give it a try.

82
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:54,940
Are you mad?

83
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,090
He's never trained in this.

84
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,530
Don't be stupid.

85
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,000
We didn't bring a wheelchair this time.

86
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,200
I might have a plan. -When was your last fight?

87
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,960
Primary school. -You won?

88
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,760
Hospitalised. -Your opponent?

89
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,680
It was me. Go back.

90
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,200
What's her name? -Miao Feifei.

91
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,040
You?

92
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,300
Zhuang Rui.

93
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,530
You like her.

94
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,560
Let's make a bet.

95
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,880
If you defeat me, I'll be your guide.

96
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,360
If I defeat you, retreat like a man.

97
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,720
Do you get me?

98
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:57,680
Deal.

99
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,940
A word spoken... -...is past recalling.

100
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,090
Come on then.

101
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,880
Careful,Zhuang Rui!

102
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,490
What happened just now?

103
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,120
Zhuang Rui...

104
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,320
...won.

105
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,720
I never expected this skinny little chap...

106
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,380
...has a few tricks of his own.

107
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,320
I never expected it,too. He actually won.

108
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,920
I bet,I pay.

109
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,610
Professor Meng,right?

110
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,280
Tell me where you want to go.

111
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,840
Thank you,Ba Te'er.

112
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,400
Let me show you our planned itinerary.

113
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,720
Don't worry,we're here to preserve historical relics.

114
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,320
We won't do anything to destroy the grassland.

115
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,130
The archeology team has entered Inner Mongolia.

116
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,380
Miao Feifei was sent by the police to join the archeological team.

117
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,440
We have to find clues to the Feng Quan before her.

118
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,000
Understood.

119
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,000
We can't let her ruin our plans again.

120
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,770
Other than Zhuang Rui, I'm sure you know what to do...

121
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,330
...with the rest of the people.

122
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,440
Don't worry,miss. I'll see to it myself.

123
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,560
Usually,the pain is more intense in the soft tissues...

124
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,100
...because of overexertion of the muscles.

125
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,130
It's from County Head Zhao. Apply it on yourself.

126
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,480
Thank you. You're so kind.

127
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,520
Why thank me? It's not from me. It's from County Head Zhao.

128
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,200
I don't think Country Head Zhao...

129
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,720
...has any idea just how much I'm hurting from that match.

130
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,090
I really never imagined that you know how to wrestle.

131
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,900
There are lots of things you never imagined.

132
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,700
I only observed it carefully for a little while.

133
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,480
You're not bad yourself. You'd have had no problem...

134
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,420
...if your strength matched his.

135
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,040
Stop fawning.

136
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,600
There is something I want to ask you.

137
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,120
What is it?

138
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,780
What gives you and Ba Te'er the right to bet on me?

139
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,800
It's all for the sake of our work.

140
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,200
Then what if you lost?

141
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,640
Then I'll.....

142
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,000
I'll.....

143
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,760
I was only thinking of persuading Ba Te'er for the sake of our work.

144
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,960
I wasn't thinking about anything else.

145
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,580
So now that you've won,...

146
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,850
...what do you intend to do?

147
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,160
Now that I've won?

148
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,120
I thought about it even less.

149
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,500
Go back and apply the medication.

150
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,680
Right ahead is the place which you marked on the map.

151
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,740
However,it's been deserted. People seldom come here.

152
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,760
Ba Te'er, we're really grateful for you.

153
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Professor Meng, you're too modest.

154
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,540
I was actually feeling uneasy...

155
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,360
...but I'm now your avid supporter.

156
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,760
Thank you. -Thank you very much.

157
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,250
Right ahead.

158
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,280
Ba Te'er.

159
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,960
What do you think,Feifei? Do you like the grassland here?

160
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,440
Yes. -Want to go horse riding with me?

161
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,620
Let's go for a spin.

162
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,120
Horse riding?

163
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,880
I get motion sickness.

164
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,440
I'll protect you.

165
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,680
Ba Te'er,I've never been on a horse. Can you teach me?

166
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,560
Next time.

167
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,880
Two hundred and forty five. Two hundred and forty six.

168
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,080
Two hundred and forty seven. Two hundred and forty eight.

169
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,440
Two hundred and forty nine. -Two hundred fifty.

170
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,500
Two hundred fifty.

171
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:35,440
Two hundred fifty. Nearly there.

172
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,600
I do three hundred each time.

173
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,720
Xiaoyun,dinner's ready. I even made mutton soup.

174
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,160
Okay! We're coming.

175
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,080
Are you coming? There's mutton soup.

176
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,140
Mutton makes you flabby but doesn't give you strength.

177
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,620
Two hundred fifty.

178
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,260
I'll begin eating.

179
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:14,800
How is it?

180
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,680
Beautiful.

181
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,800
I must have amassed good fortune in my previous life...

182
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,920
...to be able to taste this splendid soup made by you.

183
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,680
Pengfei,drink the soup while it's hot.

184
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,840
I actually invited Feifei to taste my cooking,too.

185
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,280
Now,she's left for the grasslands...

186
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,360
...without a word. -She's on an official business.

187
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:56,280
Who said that mutton soup makes you flabby but gives no strength?

188
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,240
Wasn't it you? Why are you drinking so much?

189
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,800
Health is 30% training and 70% diet.

190
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,760
We need to have more mutton soup during winter as tonic.

191
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,090
You and your arguments.

192
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,400
Xiaoyun,what was in that big box you were moving earlier?

193
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,280
They're books. -Books?

194
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,280
What's gotten into you lately that you'd have such inclinations?

195
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,560
Well,lately I've been feeling that...

196
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,120
...I haven't been storing up enough knowledge.

197
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,080
Of course,most people can't compare to me...

198
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,520
...but I feel I'm still not quite up to Zhuang Rui's standard.

199
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,640
I'm Ruiyunzhai's manager,right?

200
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,320
I feel I should study relentlessly to equip myself with knowledge.

201
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,360
What's that grunt? What do you know about this?

202
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,520
Knowledge is strength.

203
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,660
Have some more.

204
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,650
I want to be more flabby.

205
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,480
What's its name?

206
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:08,920
Ayongga.

207
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,420
It means "lightning".

208
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,000
This horse has the most explosive force I've ever seen.

209
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,060
He looks like lightning when he runs.

210
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,620
It's good that he has a master who takes good care of him.

211
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,960
I've lived here almost half my life.

212
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,100
Everyday,other than the locals that I have dealings with,...

213
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,960
...I only have my horse to talk to.

214
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,400
Have you ever thought of leaving the grassland?

215
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,760
The kids who grew up with me have all left home.

216
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,200
As for me,...

217
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,050
...I still love this place.

218
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,240
I love the air and the grassland here.

219
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,160
I love the river and I love my horse.

220
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,500
I can't bear to leave them.

221
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,010
Yes,it's very beautiful here.

222
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,160
That's right,it's very beautiful.

223
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,290
However,it used to be more beautiful.

224
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,520
The climate change has caused much of the grassland to go to waste.

225
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,280
The government has gone all out to carry out forestation...

226
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,540
...but there's no obvious improvement.

227
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,240
Wait a minute,that tract of land we saw earlier,...

228
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,570
...has it been planted with trees before?

229
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,760
Yes but with poor results.

230
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,000
Professor Meng,you said that the underground water's shift

231
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,100
...is because of the toxic leakage from the graves.

232
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,720
Yes,that's right. What about it?

233
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,520
Look at this picture. Ba Te'er told me that...

234
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,330
...there'd been efforts to conduct forestation but it failed.

235
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,060
Could it be something to do with the underground water's descent?

236
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,380
Insufficient underground water...

237
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,520
...is an indication that there are hidden tombs beneath.

238
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,820
Let Xiaoren know that we're going to take another look.

239
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,600
Professor Meng, what's the situation?

240
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,780
There are tombs beneath for sure but it's not looking good.

241
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,840
Results of the 3D scanner shows...

242
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,760
...irregularity in the tombs so they could have collapsed.

243
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,720
We'll have to act quick. -Yes.

244
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,880
Xiaoren,contact Beijing quick.

245
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,770
We'll enter the tombs first to ascertain the condition.

246
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,720
Then we'll extract the relics as soon as possible.

247
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,160
Okay.

248
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,760
Professor Meng,this is the result of another scan.

249
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,720
The underground structure is changed due to water's descent.

250
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,480
It looks like there's serious damage to the relics.

251
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,280
Professor,the maintenance and transport team need a few days.

252
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,000
We can't wait. We have to go down to the tombs now to examine them.

253
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,080
Once we know the situation there, we'll focus on the extraction...

254
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,940
...to avoid damage to the graves.

255
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,170
Professor Meng.

256
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,380
Due to Feifei's condition, I feel she shouldn't go with us.

257
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,920
Why not? I'm here to assist,too.

258
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,400
It was a close call at the Qi Yuan tombs.

259
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,200
Professor,I'll come up if I don't feel well. I won't be foolhardy.

260
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,440
Never. She will be foolhardy. -No,I won't.

261
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,960
She will. -It's decided. I'm going.

262
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,280
It's decided. We'll send her back up if anything happens.

263
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,520
All right,that's settled then.

264
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,210
That's settled.

265
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,170
Professor,be careful.

266
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,600
Take care.

267
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,640
Professor Meng. -Hello.

268
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,080
Be careful. -Professor Meng.

269
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,600
Hello. -Watch your step,professor.

270
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,420
Let's go in.

271
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,540
Everyone,stay close.

272
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,400
Professor,look at these murals. -Yes.

273
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,400
Look at this drawing.

274
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,840
Are you all right?

275
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,280
I'm okay. It's a little stuffy.

276
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,400
Stuffy?

277
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,650
There's no problem with the oxygen content here.

278
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,840
It's probably because I didn't sleep well last night.

279
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:59,360
Let's go. -Xiaozhuang,take a look at this.

280
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,120
Come and analyse its content.

281
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,480
Actually,every figure in the painting is a side profile.

282
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,090
Only this one in the middle is a front profile.

283
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,420
So I'm guessing...

284
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,280
...that this is the real master of this tomb.

285
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,210
This is not a problem...

286
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,840
...but there's something odd about the posture...

287
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,100
...of this tomb master in this painting.

288
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,680
From my analysis,...

289
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,560
...these murals are telling us a story.

290
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,560
What story?

291
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,360
King Midas.

292
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,720
King Midas?

293
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,890
I was looking at the mural right in front of us.

294
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,820
The tomb master is pointing at a stone with his left hand...

295
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,300
...and at a treasure with his right hand.

296
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,980
It implies that all the treasures found in this tomb...

297
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,520
...were magically transformed by him.

298
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,440
So my analysis tells me that there's a huge amount of...

299
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,760
...burial items and treasures in this tomb.

300
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,690
Professor Meng,what do you think?

301
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,000
That's interesting.

302
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,320
We'll find out when we get in there if this tomb master...

303
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,920
...is being mystifying on purpose. -Let's go.

304
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,920
Professor,be careful.

305
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,580
Are you sure you're all right?

306
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,000
I'm okay. -Let's go.

307
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,449
The path is blocked.

308
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,920
Could this be a trap?

309
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,540
There's irregularity in the shape of the rock so it can't be a trap.

310
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,840
This may have been caused by the collapse of the tomb.

311
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,840
Xiaohu,we'll crush the rocks. -Yes.

312
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:02,720
All right, let's go back for a rest.

313
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,850
We'll go in when they're done crushing the rocks.

314
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:08,800
Let's go.

315
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,810
What are you looking at?

316
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,200
Come on.

317
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,320
It's nothing.

318
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:34,730
Let's go.

319
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,520
There's no more wine.

320
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,040
Refill my cup.

321
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:24,080
I won't return until I'm drunk.

322
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,120
Ba Te'er,you're drinking alone?

323
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,650
Come,friend. Sit down.

324
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,000
Come.

325
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,120
Cheers.

326
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,370
Come.

327
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,360
What wine is this? It's too strong.

328
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,800
It's called Smothered Donkey Wine. -Smothered Donkey?

329
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,800
Even a donkey can get smothered? That's interesting.

330
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,480
One gets unbearably bored in the grassland...

331
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,880
...so the easiest remedy is to drink wine.

332
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,680
Besides,wine gives you courage.

333
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,460
The more you drink, the more courageous you get.

334
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,760
What do I need so much courage for?

335
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,770
I guess you don't know the story of the grassland.

336
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,560
According to legend,a lady ghost often appears in the grassland.

337
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,000
However,the ghost would always have her back towards you.

338
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,720
You can only see her hair but not her face.

339
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,880
The children were curious...

340
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,370
...as to what this lady ghost looked like.

341
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,140
So what does she look like?

342
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,200
You're curious,too?

343
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,140
The children said,...

344
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,890
...when this ghost turned around,...

345
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,690
...what they saw...

346
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,160
...was all hair.

347
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,200
What's more..... -Let's stop here.

348
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,680
Ba Te'er,I think I've had enough. I'd best be going.

349
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,320
I'm not finished!

350
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,860
Drink more wine to give you more courage!

351
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,080
Ba Te'er,I have no use for more courage.

352
00:39:27,080 --> 00:40:15,920
Why aren't you resting in the tent?

353
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,200
I can't sleep.

354
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,040
Me neither.

355
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,720
Ba Te'er said that drinking wine will give you more courage.

356
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,720
So you had a drink?

357
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:35,320
Just a bit. Didn't Wu Song have wine before fighting the tiger?

358
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:42,040
Is this fellow so timid that he needs wine to be courageous?

359
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:47,080
Look at how beautiful the moon is in the grassland.

360
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,920
I never thought you'd say things like that.

361
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,610
What do you mean?

362
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,140
You give me the impression that you're always in a rush.

363
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,690
The kind who's bustling about here and there.

364
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,480
I never thought.....

365
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,320
If only I'd known that you're this kind of a girl.

366
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,890
What do you mean?

367
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:23,040
I've been looking for a chance to apologize about Myanmar.

368
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,010
No need for that.

369
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,200
It's all because I believed too much in.....
