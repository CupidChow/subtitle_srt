1
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,500
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,800
Episode 7

3
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,480
Mr. Qian.

4
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,420
Nice Yixing clay teapot there. -It's just a teapot.

5
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,960
Mr. Qian,don't do this.

6
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,320
You said you'd play along with the young ones.

7
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,520
Be more magnanimous.

8
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,600
Zhu Kexin? -Let me see.

9
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,160
This is indeed a Zhu Kexin pot.

10
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,720
It's a valuable commodity without a market.

11
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,800
Mr. Qian has it firmly in his grip...

12
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,180
...and won't let it go.

13
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,640
Mr. Qian,is everything displayed in your shop...

14
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,600
...fake? Is it all trash?

15
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,160
Is trash the real treasure?

16
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,940
Are you playing with them on your own?

17
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,560
You said it's ceramic,right?

18
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,160
Does this Yixing clay teapot count as one?

19
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,440
Vessels made of clay or china clay are all ceramic.

20
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,600
So is the Yixing clay teapot.

21
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,360
This utensil is grand and elegant.

22
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,920
This must be Master Zhu Kexin's work in his prime.

23
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,160
However,this is the only one.

24
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,880
Mr. Qian,surely you haven't kept the rest hidden?

25
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,440
I can testify. When I came here last time,...

26
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,200
...I saw eleven pieces of them.

27
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,770
I keep them at home. There isn't enough room here.

28
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,640
Mr. Qian,please don't say that this doesn't belong here.

29
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,510
Anything that's here,...

30
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,240
...including your underpants,belongs to this place.

31
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,680
I agree.

32
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,330
Xiao Yun,watch your mouth.

33
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,000
Mr. Qian taught us everything about antiques.

34
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,440
We're willing to fork out the RMB2 million compensation.

35
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,060
The youth have no regrets.

36
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,080
Mr. Qian is a bigwig in Panjiayuan.

37
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,600
He'll keep his promise. -Yes.

38
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,460
Indeed. -Am I right,Mr. Qian?

39
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,040
Mr. Qian,we'll keep our word. Please go back...

40
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,200
...and get the eleven pots for them.

41
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,800
I'll give them away. I won't keep even one.

42
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,400
That's the way.

43
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,560
Don't be too dejected.

44
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,680
Fei Fei,look. We've got a bigger one than this at home.

45
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,880
You can come to my house to check it out.

46
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,360
I'll go to your house...

47
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,520
...on the day it gets robbed and gather evidence while I'm there.

48
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,450
What are you talking about? -Enough with being smug.

49
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,200
Lao Qian,we're keeping our word.

50
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,840
Let it go.

51
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,840
Take this as my gift for your baby's full moon celebration.

52
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,740
Here you go.

53
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,400
You're so generous. -That's nothing.

54
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,880
Young man,your name is Zhuang Rui,right?

55
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,440
Nice to meet you. -You're eagle-eyed.

56
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,400
Are you free this weekend? There's a jade seminar.

57
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,530
Are you interested?

58
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,280
A jade seminar? Okay.

59
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,920
Thank you. Thank you.....

60
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,440
Thank you,Mr. Gu.

61
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,040
This grey and white jade pendant...

62
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,130
...is a far cry from the suet white jade...

63
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,320
...Mr. Gu took out just now. Why would someone like Mr. Gu...

64
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,640
...wear something cheap like this?

65
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:28,880
VIP.

66
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,920
Fei Fei,you may join us if you have nothing to do.

67
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,920
You're the one who has nothing to do.

68
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,960
Take it! -Yes,you have nothing to do.

69
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,920
Go home and play your game.

70
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,040
Bye,Mr. Gu. -Bye.

71
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,200
Take care. -See you.

72
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,880
We made it. Should we celebrate?

73
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,240
That's not enough.

74
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,920
Mr. Qian.

75
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,160
You may drink from this pot one last time.

76
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,600
Are you saying that you've lost the Yunlong pot to Zhuang Rui?

77
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,250
Are you messing with them or me?

78
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,520
Mr. Xu,there are 500 items in my shop.

79
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,120
Even those from Palace Museum...

80
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,360
...won't spot anything within an hour.

81
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,560
I never imagined that he'd pick out Zhu Kexin's pot.

82
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,120
Mr. Gu was there. I dared not break my promise.

83
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,640
You've embarrassed yourself in front of Gu Tian Feng.

84
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,720
Qian Yao Si,my family is not after money.

85
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,560
We want honour. You can pack up and get out.

86
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,880
Mr. Xu.

87
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,120
Hello,watch Zhuang Rui and those friends of his.

88
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,200
Yes,Zhuang Rui! Are you deaf?

89
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,610
You're here.

90
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:52,980
Take a seat.

91
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,240
Is everything okay? -There's nothing serious.

92
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,120
Fat bird. You're a fat bird.

93
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,680
Fat bird. You're a fat bird. -Don't you dare to howl before me.

94
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,010
Fat bird. -Get rid of it.

95
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,160
Get out of here. -Fat bird.

96
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,440
The Yixing clay teapot is only a few million dollars.

97
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,770
Did you have to go so far?

98
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,200
I just can't stand that brash Average Joe Zhuang Rui.

99
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,060
He made a bit of money and thinks he can climb all over me.

100
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,730
Zhuang Rui and Huangfu Yun did nothing wrong.

101
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,290
Why are you angry with them?

102
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,160
Yes.

103
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,040
Men are egoistic.

104
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,250
Enough,I won't let them spoil our wonderful time together.

105
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,780
Try the steak here.

106
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,840
A great man once said..... No!

107
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,480
I've said it myself already!

108
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,520
Pick yourself up each time you fall.

109
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,880
As for us,we take off directly from where we fall!

110
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,240
Rui,dinner time.

111
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,120
I'm so happy.

112
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,280
Rich man,...

113
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,400
...why are you still eating this after taking off?

114
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,050
What's wrong with this?

115
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,160
You ordered too much.

116
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,320
It wouldn't be a celebration if we didn't order this much.

117
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,540
Miss Policewoman,don't touch the chopsticks yet.

118
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,250
The main dish isn't out yet.

119
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,680
You'll feel good looking at them while eating.

120
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,210
We'll feel better if we look at them together.

121
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,420
Come on,let's eat.

122
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,520
Uncle De,is there anything special with the jade seminar?

123
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,360
You're a history student.

124
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,770
You should know that...

125
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,560
...Chinese jade and antiques have a connection.

126
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,720
In the world of antiques,Chinese jade is very important.

127
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,240
If you do more research on Chinese jade,...

128
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,080
...it'll help your future study of history.

129
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:13,720
So...

130
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,810
...the Chinese jade...

131
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,640
...is a little different from the antique circle.

132
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,800
The Chinese jade circle is more confined.

133
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,480
Take this jade association for example.

134
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,480
The participants are either big shots of the jade field...

135
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,720
...or so-called rich people with strong purchasing power.

136
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,840
Gu Tian Feng has been the president of the association...

137
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,840
...for over 20 years.

138
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,380
A man of his calibre is inviting you personally.

139
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,400
You should take it as an opportunity.

140
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,880
I'm not well-versed in things like jadeite and jade.

141
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,920
Then just treat it as a trip to Panjiayuan.

142
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,680
What to do? It's still the same old adage for me,

143
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,960
Look and listen,speak and buy less.

144
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,800
I'll give you books for reference when you go home.

145
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,640
Most of the books about jades out there...

146
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,200
...are printed by the merchants. They're not worth reading.

147
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,980
Mine are teaching materials with basis.

148
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,880
If you intend to...

149
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,760
...do a cram session,be ready for some hard work.

150
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,480
It's okay,last minute studies and cram session are my forte.

151
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,280
Do good and forget your worries.

152
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,720
Uncle De,can you...

153
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,740
...give this to me?

154
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,120
This is not good enough. I'll write a proper one for you.

155
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,360
Okay. Thank you,Uncle De.

156
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,520
Where did you get this?

157
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,760
This is heavy.

158
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,320
They can't be bronze vessels,can they?

159
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,680
Knowledge...

160
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,100
...is the greatest treasure.

161
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,480
Well,...

162
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,840
...you're right. I'll give you all my treasure then.

163
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,280
These books are not just for me to read. You have to read up,too.

164
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,740
We're going to that jade seminar,aren't we?

165
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,480
How can we go unprepared?

166
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,840
Yes,Uncle De is right.

167
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,610
I should study hard.

168
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,490
I should be able to gain something if I put effort into it.

169
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,160
Besides,I'm smart,right?

170
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,840
Ten books in a night shouldn't be a problem.

171
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,680
Let's work hard together.

172
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,600
I won't mention the mess in Gansu.

173
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,200
Next time,get people who are a little more professional.

174
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,410
Don't make the same mistake again.

175
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,690
I was careless with my choice of people. Sorry,Miss.

176
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,040
Now the police are involved.

177
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,040
Don't draw too much attention to yourself after this.

178
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,200
West Royal will try to break into China market later.

179
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,260
I'll be very much occupied with this.

180
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,560
As for you,keep finding news of Yumu.

181
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,080
Get going.

182
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,420
What time is it now?

183
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,860
You're still at it?

184
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,880
Are you preparing for...

185
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,940
...National Higher Education Entrance Examination?

186
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,560
Just read them tomorrow if you can't finish them today.

187
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,530
I'm done with these.

188
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,360
What?

189
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,760
You've finished reading these?

190
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,720
You're really something.

191
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,680
I'm a history student. I have good memory.

192
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,930
I'm an expert in cram sessions.

193
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,130
You can take a look at parts where I've marked.

194
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,020
Before we leave for the jade seminar,...

195
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,810
...just memorise all the parts that I've marked.

196
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,200
Luckily I went abroad.

197
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,760
Hello? -Mr. Yu.

198
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,770
What do you intend to do? -You're just a subordinate.

199
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,080
I don't need to report my intention to you.

200
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,160
Get your lady boss on the phone.

201
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,960
I've brought the money. Where's the stuff?

202
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,120
I can't simply...

203
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,540
...hand you such an important thing.

204
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,240
Go to Guanting Reservoir...

205
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,440
...at 3pm tomorrow.

206
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,460
I'm not free tomorrow.

207
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,700
Do you still want it or not?

208
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,520
I'm warning you..... -Meet me at the jade seminar...

209
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,650
...at 3pm tomorrow.

210
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,180
If you can carry it,I'll give you another RMB5 million.

211
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,120
What venue did you say?

212
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,160
He Ping Building,Dong San Huan Nan Road.

213
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,850
Tian Xin Guesthouse,the balcony facing southeast direction.

214
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,200
How can you let such an important criminal escape from the hospital?

215
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,760
It's obvious that...

216
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,880
...this criminal is very tenacious.

217
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,120
The police will arrest him!

218
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,570
You'd better come up with a plan right now!

219
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,200
Sir! -Come in.

220
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,560
Sir Ding and Madam Miao,the assisting officers...

221
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,140
...have sent the information of every hotel guest last night.

222
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,240
They'd like Madam Miao to verify it.

223
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,200
Go! -Yes,Sir Ding.

224
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,320
Don't worry,I'll definitely arrest him...

225
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,280
...as well as the mastermind.

226
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,520
Go. -Okay. Let's go.

227
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:49,980
Zoom in.

228
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,240
Pause.

229
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,960
Which room is this person in?

230
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,060
He's checked out. -When did he check out?

231
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,400
He did some time ago.

232
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,880
Doesn't he look like this person? How could you let him in?

233
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,080
Madam,mine is different,too.

234
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,530
Some people are photogenic. What's wrong with that?

235
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,240
Contact us immediately if he comes back.

236
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:19,960
Okay.

237
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,200
What do you think? I've put on my best outfit today.

238
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,260
I dressed well for this jade seminar,right?

239
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,240
You look okay. -Let's go.

240
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,160
Gentlemen.

241
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,970
What's with the mask today?

242
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,320
It's fashion,understand? -Sure.

243
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,360
You seem to have better taste now.

244
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,600
Of course.

245
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,420
The characters are not clear,...

246
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,880
...but it's the best street  stall good you could get.

247
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,880
Mr. Zhuang still does as he pleases.

248
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,280
We're here to look at jade,not do catwalk like you.

249
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,880
Jade is good.

250
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,200
It's far more profitable.

251
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,880
However,if you make a loss in your purchases,...

252
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,810
...it won't compare to what happened in Panjiayuan.

253
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,340
Best of luck to you two.

254
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,930
By the way,I know a good purchasing agent.

255
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,900
Contact me if you need one.

256
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,880
He's so mean.

257
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,160
Was he deriding me just now? -Didn't you say it's expensive?

258
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,480
It costs over RMB100. That's expensive to me.

259
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,080
Introducing Xu Jewellery's...

260
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,940
...South China region General Manager,Mr. Xu Wei.

261
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,560
Xu Jewellery has been the honourable merchant...

262
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,720
...at the seminar for many years.

263
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,320
We look forward to the company...

264
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,800
...achieving even greater honour at the event this year.

265
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,200
The 6 jewellery experts and 52 merchants...

266
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,720
...who are invited are all present.

267
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,080
Please appreciate the beauty of the jade today.

268
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,920
I'm Liu Jia,the curator. Thank you again for your attendance.

269
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,200
Welcome. -Welcome.

270
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,820
What's with this lady?

271
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,960
Look at her teeth.

272
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,210
What are you talking about?

273
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,140
Are you buying a horse?

274
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,820
Is this how you view women? -Welcome.

275
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,560
I'm just saying she has very white teeth.

276
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,840
So you're here.

277
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,280
We came here to see some jade. You're here,too.

278
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,840
Anyway,be cautious.

279
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,080
Is it dangerous here?

280
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,580
It's dangerous...

281
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,700
...whenever you're with him.

282
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,640
You talk about danger all the time. Aren't you here to see me?

283
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,560
Is she your friend? -Who are you?

284
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,360
This is my friend,Liu Jia. She's the curator.

285
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,720
Who is he?

286
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,200
I'm Huangfu Yun. It's a Chinese compound surname.

287
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,760
It's yun of "xing yun liu shui" (natural and smooth).

288
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,560
My name has Western Zhou origin.

289
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,560
You know Abbess Western Zhou,right?

290
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,090
Who's the other gentleman?

291
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,480
This is my buddy from the history faculty...

292
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,240
...in Beijing University,Zhuang Rui.

293
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,180
We're both into antique collection.

294
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,840
Mr. Gu personally invited us here.

295
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,760
So we just came for a look.

296
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,880
Was it Mr. Gu Tian Feng?

297
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,930
He's a rich,fine gentleman from a prestigious university.

298
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,320
Why didn't you introduce me to such an eligible bachelor?

299
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,290
Are you talking about Huangfu Yun?

300
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,560
I think I stand a chance. -You stand a chance?

301
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,060
We haven't even looked at the jade. What do you mean?

302
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,480
Didn't you see how Miss Liu Jia's eyes shone when she looked at me?

303
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,520
Liu Jia,when did you become...

304
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,160
...so desperate?

305
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,770
Who's talking about Huangfu Yun? I meant Zhuang Rui.

306
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,720
It's not that I'm desperate. Miao Fei Fei,are you blind?

307
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,440
Look at all the men in here.

308
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,210
They're either middle-aged uncouth rich or rich spoilt brats.

309
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,080
Look at Zhuang Rui. He's so refined and modest.

310
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,520
He's also low-key. He's pure and innocent.

311
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,040
So am I.

312
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,760
You're the one who's blind.

313
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,520
Fei Fei,why don't you be a matchmaker?

314
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,960
Bring out my good points before him.

315
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,720
I didn't notice that.

316
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,320
Can you go on your own later?

317
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,050
Please get out of the way and not steal the limelight from me.

318
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,320
Okay.

319
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,610
If you're not used to the food here,...

320
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,820
...just order anything you wish. I'll pay for it later.

321
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,290
Is this your first time attending a jade exhibition?

322
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,660
This time,there are a lot of fine jadeite and diamonds on display.

323
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,600
Some merchants have brought ore to be auctioned off.

324
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,880
They're of good quality,too. Why don't I take you around?

325
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,340
Didn't you say you wanted to find out more...

326
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,920
...about jade and all the good things? Go ahead.

327
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,520
That's right. I'd appreciate it if Ms. Liu would take me around.

328
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,840
Would you mind,Miss Liu Jia?

329
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,600
That's right,she has a lot of experiences.

330
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,090
She's planned many jade seminars before.

331
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,160
Didn't you say you had a stomach ache?

332
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,160
Go on.

333
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,320
Actually,I've always been interested in the jade industry.

334
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,440
Coming here this time,I was hoping to find...

335
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,720
...the world's rarest gem...

336
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,960
...as a gift to my future sweetheart.

337
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,920
I didn't expect to meet her so soon.

338
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,020
I'm sorry. What were you saying just now?

339
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,800
Well,which astrological sign are you?

340
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,000
Madam Miao,the exhibition has begun. Do we go according to plan?

341
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:57,240
Start the inspection. Notify me when you've identified the target.

342
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,770
We'll take action once we've surrounded him.

343
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,920
Make sure there's no risk to the people around.

344
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:16,880
It's deep green in colour...

345
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,530
...and speckled evenly...

346
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,960
...with microgranular crystal.

347
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,040
The exterior is exquisite and pure like glass.

348
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,880
This is like what I've read in the book.

349
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,610
It's the finest jade,the Burmese jadeite,a glass type of jadeite.

350
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,960
You have great taste.

351
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,150
Ms. Qin.

352
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,770
This Burmese jade looks highly transparent.

353
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,870
Feel free to check it out. -This is.....

354
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,720
This is my family's exhibition section.

355
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,090
My family is focused on expanding to China in the last few years.

356
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,640
So we took part in this exhibition.

357
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,520
You're not only interested in bottle gourds.

358
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,250
You know quite a lot about jade.

359
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,960
Well,it's a coincidence.....

360
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:19,320
Let me take you there. -Okay.

361
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,120
Waitress. Come here.

362
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,360
Go over there and spill some wine on him.

363
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:46,930
Understood.

364
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,410
As a result,after a long time.....

365
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,960
Hi,would you like some wine?

366
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,890
I'm so sorry,sir. I didn't hold my tray properly. Sorry.

367
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,400
I'm really sorry. -It's all right.

368
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,780
Get someone to clean this up. -Oh no. You're all wet.

369
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,720
It's okay. My clothes are dark in colour. It doesn't matter.

370
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,880
Your pants are white. It would've been stained.

371
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,200
No way. Follow me. I'll take you to somewhere you can clean up.

372
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,720
Madam Miao,the number of visitors to the exhibition,...

373
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,160
...including staff,is increasing. -Ms. Qin.

374
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,760
It'll be difficult to check them one by one...

375
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,960
...without raising suspicions.

376
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,840
What should we do?

377
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,890
Block all exits first. Don't let the suspect out.

378
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,040
Okay. Understood.

379
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,800
What is this?

380
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,320
You changed into a new outfit.

381
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,840
Are you pretending to be a wealthy man?

382
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:17,720
Grandfather,it's a great seminar. -That's right.

383
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,040
Mr. Gu!

384
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,600
Xiao Zhuang,good to see you here. -Zhuang Rui.

385
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,000
Mr. Gu!

386
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,120
Fei Fei! Are you here to see me?

387
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,920
I thought you.....

388
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,740
Leave Madam Miao alone. She's here on an official duty.

389
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,860
Okay,go ahead.

390
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,370
Xiao Zhuang,what do you think?

391
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,200
It's okay,I haven't really gotten the knack of it yet.

392
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,600
Even so,you can still join the fun,right?

393
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:52,040
I suggest you to go over to the stone gambling hall at the back.

394
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,560
It's very interesting. See you there later.

395
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,480
Okay. Thank you,Mr. Gu. -You're welcome. Let's go.

396
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,520
See you.

397
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,930
Fei Fei,it'll be very lively at the stone gambling hall.

398
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,800
See you there! -Grow up!

399
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,060
Come on,grandfather!

400
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,840
Xiao Zhao,get a group of men to the back hall.

401
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,160
Check everyone before the stone gambling begins.

402
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,440
Understood. -Okay.

403
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,240
Xiao Rui,look who I bumped into.

404
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:51,820
Brother Ma!

405
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,000
Not bad. You two are into jade now.

406
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,220
Are you having a full bet or half-bet?

407
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,160
What do you mean? Is there a difference?

408
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,160
I mean,can you gamble in public places?

409
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,840
You know nothing at all. Stone gambling is not gambling.

410
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,570
It means to buy at your own risk.

411
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,600
It means to take a gamble on the presence of jade in a stone.

412
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,520
Don't you get it? Let me generalise it for you.

413
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,600
Look at this one. It's raw.

414
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,440
It's never been opened. It's cheaper with higher risk.

415
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,160
You can't see what's inside.

416
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,940
As for this one,...

417
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,010
...you can see the green part in there.

418
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:44,720
You stand a higher chance of making a fortune.

419
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,200
However,the risk is even higher.

420
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,920
You can lose millions in betting on this.

421
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,720
This piece is not bad. Look at it.

422
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,540
The green part is showing.

423
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,040
Its exterior looks good,too.

424
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,960
It'll cost at least RMB3 million. -What?

425
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,480
RMB3 million? Are we betting this much?

426
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,640
Is there a kind of instrument...

427
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,810
...that can scan right through it?

428
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,760
Can you unlock the Bank of China? -What do you mean?

429
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,600
There's no such instrument.

430
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,610
No one can brag about it.

431
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,280
No one can tell if there's jade in a rock.

432
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,920
It's called stone gambling as you can't see what's inside.

433
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,920
Well,I've just returned from abroad.

434
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,480
I'm not too familiar with this. -It's the same abroad.

435
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,680
Really?

436
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,520
Brother Ma,if I end up buying a stone...

437
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,520
...with nothing inside,...

438
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,480
...can I return it? -You can.

439
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:51,480
You'll be beaten up. Of course you can't return it.

440
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,520
We can't do anything,too,if we misjudge a piece of antique.

441
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,650
That's true.

442
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,960
Let me warn you,stone gambling is very addictive.

443
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,900
A friend of mine lost over RMB10 million on this.

444
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,120
He ended up getting stones with nothing inside.

445
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:15,080
With the last RMB5,000 he had,he bought a rough rock like this.

446
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,440
He found jade in it.

447
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,320
In his excitement,he broke it...

448
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,400
...into pieces. The RMB8 million jade...

449
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,960
...was broken into pieces. -What? RMB8 million?

450
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,320
What a roller coaster ride.

451
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,040
So what happened to your friend in the end?
