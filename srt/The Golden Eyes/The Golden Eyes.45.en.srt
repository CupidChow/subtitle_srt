1
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,000
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 45

3
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,920
Why is it so dark here?

4
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,720
Xiaorui, I think it's a little scary.

5
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,840
What are all these?

6
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,160
This should be a rock painting that was painted with stone tools.

7
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,880
These patterns match the texture of the rock...

8
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,960
...and thus,present such an irregular pattern.

9
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:52,240
Did someone come in before us?

10
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,480
They activated the mechanism,...

11
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,720
...hence these rocks fell on the floor.

12
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,040
Goodness! What is that?

13
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,120
If I'm not mistaken,...

14
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,200
...the last team who entered this cave...

15
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,360
...was my grandfather's archaeological team.

16
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,800
Xiaorui,let's hurry and go.

17
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,079
The rocks above us aren't stable and may drop down anytime.

18
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,760
Let's go.

19
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,760
What is it? -The car broke down.

20
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,600
Stupid,hurry and repair it! -Yes.

21
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,200
It's them. They're heading West. They're going after Zhuang Rui.

22
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,280
No,A'Bu isn't there. They've left him at the site.

23
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,960
Why wait? Let's save him. -No.

24
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,200
Since we met them, it's a pity to let them go.

25
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,440
I'll hold them off.

26
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,320
You save A'Bu. Go. -Yes.

27
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,200
Come back,don't chase then! We have an important task to do.

28
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,240
Hurry!

29
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,360
Hurry and get in the car!

30
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,080
Xiaorui,there are many doors. Which goes to Feng Quan's Tomb?

31
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,240
The structure here.

32
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,200
Look at the structure here.

33
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,240
Does it look like the Bagua Zhen?

34
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,960
So?

35
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,600
Bagua Zhen comes from the Taichi image and presents a subtle array.

36
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,800
Life,injury,hindrance,scenery, death,dismay and opening.

37
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,440
These are the Eight Gates, also known as Bagua Eight Gates.

38
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,080
No,I don't know about those things.

39
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
Just tell us which door we should go through.

40
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,360
In the Bagua Zhen,there is a life door and a death door.

41
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,800
This means that not all the doors are safe.

42
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,120
Only 1 door will lead to Feng Quan's Tomb.

43
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,360
Then which is the correct door?

44
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,840
Just trust Xiaorui. Let him do it.

45
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,840
What happened?

46
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,640
I cannot use the Golden Eyes.

47
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,560
What is it?

48
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,760
Are you all right? -Are you all right?

49
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,720
I'm fine. The side effects of the Golden Eyes may have started.

50
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,240
I'll try again.

51
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,360
Are you all right?

52
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,000
Xiaorui,you may be too tired after rushing here.

53
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,560
No,there's a problem with this place.

54
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,920
What is the problem?

55
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,520
I cannot use the Golden Eyes.

56
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,840
Are you saying that...

57
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,800
...Feng Quan designed this Bagua Door...

58
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,440
...so that people with the Golden Eyes cannot use them?

59
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,600
Wait, what does Feng Quan want?

60
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,160
He designed the game but don't allow us to use strategy.

61
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,400
How can you play then?

62
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,040
Zhuang Rui,do you want to rest first before trying again?

63
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,400
Without the Golden Eyes, we cannot find the correct door.

64
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,480
How can we try?

65
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,960
His head is in pain.

66
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,760
The worst is...

67
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,840
...we enter forcefully.

68
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,480
Miss Miao, there are 8 doors here.

69
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,240
Without the Golden Eyes,we can't find the correct door,...

70
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,400
...it's the same as meeting a dead end.

71
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,560
So?

72
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,760
Zhuang Rui's grandfather didn't have the Golden Eyes,too.

73
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,200
He entered Feng Quan's Tomb with his own ability.

74
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,520
We must not find shortcuts when faced with a little danger.

75
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,000
So without the Golden Eyes,can we not survive?

76
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,520
Feifei is right.

77
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
If I have it,I am lucky.

78
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,400
If not,it's my fate.

79
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,720
My grandfather didn't have the Golden Eyes but he could enter.

80
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,880
I would be able to do the same.

81
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,840
Since this is a Bagua Door,...

82
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,600
...I will use the Bagua to predict.

83
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,200
Bagua Zhen originated from the Yellow River Map...

84
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,720
...and was created by Fuxi.

85
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,720
Sky,earth,thunder,wind, water,fire,mountain and lake...

86
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,880
...correspond to...

87
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,600
...Eight Gates,life, injury,hindrance,...

88
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,360
...scenery,death, dismay and opening.

89
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,520
Is it easier that way?

90
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,760
No,it's not.

91
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,040
Everything here is not static.

92
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,960
They all change over time.

93
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,040
What is the time now?

94
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,000
10.40 p.m.

95
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,440
It should be 40.

96
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,400
40 represents gold.

97
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,960
Gold is located at the west of the lake.

98
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,400
Lake leads to sky.

99
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,360
This is the sky.

100
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,760
This is the sky. Sky corresponds to the opening.

101
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,080
The sky opposes earth.

102
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,040
Earth should correspond to the death door.

103
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,200
Mountain is the life door.

104
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,240
This is the one.

105
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,880
Xiaorui,you are really good! -Wait.

106
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,440
What is it? -It's not this door.

107
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,440
No. Sky and earth,Qian and Kun.

108
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,400
I also know this general knowledge.

109
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,920
Everything here has been changed.

110
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,680
I think the purpose is to prevent those who enter here...

111
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,160
...from easily finding the life door.

112
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,200
I need to identify the location one by one now.

113
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,560
Move back,everyone.

114
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,400
Eight Gates,...

115
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,400
...obstruction,...

116
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,000
...opening.

117
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,720
Opening.

118
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,720
Follow me!

119
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,800
Brother Gui, there is only 1 way.

120
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,280
They must be inside.

121
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,080
They will not be able to escape this time.

122
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,720
Destroy the wall.

123
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,320
Xiaorui.

124
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,880
Xiaorui, you have eliminated 6 doors.

125
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,320
Now,there are only the life door and...

126
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,800
...the death door left.

127
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,080
One is to go to Feng Quan's Tomb.

128
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,000
The other...

129
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,160
...will lead to our graves.

130
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,640
It's bad. That is Brother Gui.

131
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,680
They cannot open the sundial mechanism...

132
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,760
...so explosives are used. -If they do that,...

133
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,040
...we will not be able to escape later. There's no time.

134
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,640
We must choose the door.

135
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,040
Xiaorui,...

136
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,160
...do you know which is the life door?

137
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,840
I'll go and ascertain now.

138
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,200
Are you mad? You are going to die.

139
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,080
This is the only way.

140
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,600
Xiaoyun!

141
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,400
Xiaoyun!

142
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,480
How can I let you do this kind of thing?

143
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,720
Do you still remember?

144
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,640
I'm your lucky star.

145
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,280
Xiaoyun!

146
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,960
Hurry and follow!

147
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,800
I've told you that I'm your lucky star. Hurry and come here!

148
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:32,840
Hurry and go! Quick!

149
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,120
Hurry and get in!

150
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,520
Quick!

151
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,760
Why are you not going? -Hurry!

152
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,120
You go. I'll hold them.

153
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,720
Officer Miao,I leave him to you. -What are you saying?

154
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,880
Go! Hurry and go!

155
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,400
Go! Hurry!

156
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,320
Qin Xuanbing!

157
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:32,760
Qin Xuanbing! Don't move! Stand there!

158
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,800
Qin Xuanbing!

159
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,000
Are you all right?

160
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,080
Zhuang Rui.

161
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,480
I want to find Feng Quan's Tomb to fulfil the task given by father.

162
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,120
I have never wanted to hurt any of you,...

163
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,520
...especially Zhuang Rui.

164
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,640
Trust me,I'll save you.

165
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
You've lied to me many times.

166
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,480
How can I trust you?

167
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,800
Zhuang Rui,...

168
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,200
...we'll go first.

169
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,080
The best solution is to find a professional rescue team here...

170
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,080
...to find her body.

171
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,520
Okay?

172
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,960
Let's go,Xiaorui. Let's go.

173
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,440
Here.

174
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,040
Someone came in here before.

175
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,560
It must be the archaeological team we talked about.

176
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,280
What are we waiting for? Let's hurry and enter.

177
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,240
Why are you not entering?

178
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,080
You have struggled with hardships...

179
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,960
...to find the secret of the Golden Eyes.

180
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,000
Go in.

181
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,560
Maybe there will be things that you want inside.

182
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,240
The price paid is too much.

183
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,760
I have sacrificed a lot.

184
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,760
So you planned all these.

185
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,480
It's not me,...

186
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,680
...it's fate.

187
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,160
It should not be like this.

188
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,680
Then how should it be?

189
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,360
I thought you will understand after going through all these.

190
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,840
Did you design the Bagua Zhen to disable my Golden Eyes?

191
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,280
You still manage to enter.

192
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,600
You really didn't use the Golden Eyes.

193
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,520
Go in.

194
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,720
Go in and have a look.

195
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,400
Maybe there will an answer that you want inside.

196
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,680
These seem to be the archaeological team's items.

197
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,320
Xiaorui,come and have a look.

198
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,760
Look,is this your grandfather?

199
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,080
Could it be that Grandfather Zhuang is.....

200
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,040
From the shape of the pelvis, this should be a woman.

201
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,600
This should be a man.

202
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,520
When Grandfather Zhuang joined the archaeological team,...

203
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,560
...he broke his leg from a fall and there was reinforced steel.

204
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:39,080
However,these 2 bodies are perfect with no broken bones.

205
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,400
So he should have escaped safely.

206
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,480
Xiaoyun, look at this body's teeth.

207
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,200
Their teeth are sharp...

208
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,320
...and have smaller gaps.

209
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,080
It seems that...

210
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,720
...the enamel damage is not obvious.

211
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,920
It should be around 30 years old.

212
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,560
It should be a member of grandfather's archaeological team.

213
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,520
This body..... -What is wrong with this body?

214
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,560
This body is a bit unusual.

215
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,040
The gaps between teeth are huge...

216
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,600
...and the crown is small.

217
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,720
However, the teeth root is exposed.

218
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,560
This is obviously the teeth of an old person.

219
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,120
Old person? How old was he?

220
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,920
From the teeth condition,...

221
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,400
...he should be more than 100 years old.

222
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,120
100 years old?

223
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,080
The rumour of Feng Quan living until 120 years old is true.

224
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,920
It should be.

225
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,800
Unknown three words and the word 'for'.

226
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,960
Light?

227
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,320
The extreme darkness will be the light.

228
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,080
The extreme darkness will be the light.

229
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,080
What does this sentence mean?

230
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,200
Don't bother about its meaning.

231
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,840
This is the coffin from Qin dynasty.

232
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,320
There is an eye. This must be the tomb of Feng Quan.

233
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,520
Xiaorui,after all hardships, we finally found Feng Quan's Tomb.

234
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,880
Male. Name,Tai Mu.

235
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,840
Born in Qin Shihuang's first year of reign.

236
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,440
Died in sixth year of Zhongyuan.

237
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,280
Which years are Qin Shihuang's first year of reign...

238
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,960
...and sixth Zhongyuan?

239
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,560
246 BC to 144 BC.

240
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,480
246 BC to 14.....

241
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,360
It's around 102 years old.

242
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,040
Xiaorui,you will not die.

243
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,360
Feng Quan lived until 102 years old. You will,too.

244
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,150
No. You can live until 110 years old.

245
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,440
120 years old!

246
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,960
I have said that you are blessed.

247
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,840
I'm still waiting for you to marry.

248
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,600
Why? Are you not happy for being able to live long?

249
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,190
For me,these aren't important.

250
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,150
I just hope that I...

251
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,630
...can be like all of you...

252
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,120
...and leave here safely.

253
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,190
Xiaorui is right.

254
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,160
Report!

255
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,400
I'm Feng Quan, I have something to report!

256
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,240
Nonsense! It's the middle of the night. Speak!

257
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,480
I didn't sleep and found signs of a quake.

258
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,960
The stars are aligned and there is a red light.

259
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,720
There are unusual activities in the sky and the earth.

260
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,840
I think it is a bad sign.

261
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,120
How daring! Where is General Bai?

262
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,760
Don't be upset,general. He is a coward. It's his first watch.

263
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,920
Please don't be upset,general.

264
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,520
You're scared as it's your first time,I'll not punish you.

265
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,280
Go away.

266
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,560
General,please trust me. General!

267
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,080
Let's go. -General!

268
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,200
Hurry and go!

269
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,360
Go quickly. -General!

270
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,400
Attack!
