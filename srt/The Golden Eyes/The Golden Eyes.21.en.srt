1
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,500
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,500
Episode 21

3
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,880
How far is the mine from here?

4
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,250
It's quite near.

5
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,640
Let's go to the mine first.

6
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:51,840
Okay.

7
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,020
Be careful.

8
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,800
It's so dusty!

9
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,720
Thank you.

10
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,079
You're a Chinese!

11
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,320
My mother built a school in the village.

12
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,520
Most of the children understand simple Mandarin.

13
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,720
My mother always says that the world is changing fast.

14
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,400
In the future,there will only be machines in the mine...

15
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,600
...and workers will be obsolete.

16
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,480
Therefore,the children should study...

17
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,280
...so that they will have a chance to make a choice.

18
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,600
What is a mine village?

19
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,280
The mine is far from the town.

20
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,610
The villages nearby...

21
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,320
...eventually combine and become a new mine village.

22
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,520
Most of the young men work in the mine.

23
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,720
However,if we still can't find a good material,...

24
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,740
...the mine will be sold soon.

25
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,480
Will the workers be fired?

26
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,000
If the owner...

27
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,240
...has a team, then he won't keep the workers.

28
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,160
The rich are cruel.

29
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,080
We are always told to buy the material from your mine...

30
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,400
...as it is famous for good materials.

31
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,360
Transformation brings changes.

32
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,720
However,I believe that Director Hu...

33
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,530
...will be nice to the workers.

34
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,159
There was a flash flood in the village a few years ago.

35
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,200
My mother hired them and taught them to use the machines...

36
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,200
...so that they can work in the mine.

37
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,080
I can't imagine...

38
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,040
...their lives after leaving this place.

39
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,240
I hope the new owner will keep them.

40
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,340
What is over there?

41
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,800
Those are the waste.

42
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,640
Can we have a look? -Sure.

43
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,960
Let's go. -What is so great about it?

44
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,960
This is one of the branches.

45
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,010
Based on my mother's performance,...

46
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,180
...I think it will be closed soon.

47
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,320
It may be sold soon.

48
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,240
Before his death,my grandfather said he wanted to be buried here.

49
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,800
Although he wasn't born here, he grew up here.

50
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,760
My mother and I spread his ashes here ten years ago.

51
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,440
I can't bear to leave this place.

52
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,640
Don't be sad.

53
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,320
There may be a miracle. The mine is still yours.

54
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,760
Zhuang Rui may be able to help you.

55
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,220
Am I right,Zhuang Rui?

56
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,610
There will be a miracle.

57
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,600
The stone that Xiaoyun is holding...

58
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,280
...contains jade.

59
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,640
Do you know its significance?

60
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,800
It's a jackpot!

61
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,880
Then this is.....

62
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,720
Please just tell us.

63
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,690
This is a jade from the old mine.

64
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,480
The jade from the old mine moves with the water flow...

65
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,800
...and high quality jade is formed after a certain period.

66
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,560
It usually appears in a large amount.

67
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,120
Therefore,there should be more than one piece in the mine.

68
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,940
Tell us the main point. -The main point is...

69
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,360
...there are still plenty of good jade in the mine.

70
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,880
Is it true?

71
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,900
Then,it's possible to save the mine!

72
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:41,200
Where is the proof?

73
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,720
This is only my speculation.

74
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,260
My mother and her workers have searched the mine...

75
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,330
...but they didn't find anything.

76
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,760
I think we are too naive.

77
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,880
We don't have to worry about it since there are many experts.

78
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,280
I think we should believe in Xiaorui.

79
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,880
Since there may be good materials, why should we give up now?

80
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,410
This is a piece of good news.

81
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,800
Xiaofei,I think you've improved a lot recently.

82
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,130
I'm proud of you.

83
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,560
I think Pengfei is right.

84
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,840
The new source is very important to Hu family.

85
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,680
We should give it a try no matter what it is.

86
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,720
If there is new jade in the mine,...

87
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,120
...my mother will definitely keep the mine.

88
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,440
There was a rumour...

89
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,680
...saying that our mine...

90
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,100
...has become an abandoned mine.

91
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,400
We'll suffer great losses if we sell it.

92
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,280
Wenwen,why don't you tell your mother...

93
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,320
...our idea?

94
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,320
It may be a new chance for the mine.

95
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,540
We'll sign the contract soon. I hope you can keep your promise.

96
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,440
Sure. I'll keep the promise as long as you get things done.

97
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,840
Wenwen had talked to me.

98
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,680
You may tell me directly.

99
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,040
I'll take it seriously.

100
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,200
Miss Hu is very concerned about this matter.

101
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,320
Yes. She is my daughter after all.

102
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,680
I'm glad that she is very sensible.

103
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,080
However,I've made up my mind.

104
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,160
I'll sign the contract in two days.

105
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,160
That's fast!

106
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,120
It has been dragged on for too long.

107
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,440
I made a high bid to buy the stone...

108
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,520
...because I want to prove that Hu family is still doing well...

109
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,800
...and I can't afford to lose again.

110
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,360
I would rather lose some money to play safe.

111
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,240
Aunt Hu.

112
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,520
Have a seat.

113
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,360
I know I shouldn't tell you...

114
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,880
...or anyone else...

115
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,440
...but...

116
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,000
...I trust myself.

117
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,860
I've never made a wrong judgement in stones.

118
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,650
I've never made a wrong judgement in people,too.

119
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,320
I know you are a good child.

120
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,400
I told you because I know that you worry about us.

121
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,400
If I sell the mine,...

122
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,120
...I could still maintain our status in the industry...

123
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,520
...and look for new development. I could also...

124
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,980
...buy the materials and process them like Mr. Qin.

125
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,280
Mr. Zhou had sent me the report.

126
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,880
There is no sign of jade.

127
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,680
We've wasted many resources.

128
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,600
I can't afford to drag it on any longer.

129
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,360
I hope to find a new source,too...

130
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,320
...but...

131
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,440
...I can't take the risk...

132
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,240
...just because of what you said.

133
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,920
I understand.

134
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,440
Then,...

135
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,090
...what about we work together...

136
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,140
...and share the risk?

137
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,320
We'll divide the profit based on the share.

138
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,890
Xiaozhuang,...

139
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,980
...do you know that...

140
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,120
...even Mr. Qin is scared to work with me?

141
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,440
I really think that it is a good mine...

142
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,160
...but I don't know how to express myself.

143
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,800
I was too reckless. If I made a mistake,...

144
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,580
...please forgive me.

145
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,280
Are you really interested in the mine?

146
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,040
Although I'm not familiar with the mine,...

147
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,600
...I'm quite confident in judging the stones.

148
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,880
Between stone gambling and finding a jade core,...

149
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,280
...I believe that there are similarities.

150
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,920
A mine is like a stone.

151
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,680
The way that we cut it...

152
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,040
...and the person cutting it affects the value of the stone.

153
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,280
Of course it depends on our luck,too.

154
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,730
Nothing is absolute...

155
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,080
...but I hope that you can take it into consideration.

156
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,000
How confident are you?

157
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,560
60%.

158
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,320
60%?

159
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,200
Young man, you're taking a big risk!

160
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,840
High risk,high return.

161
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,280
It's up to you...

162
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,940
...whether you want to take the risk.

163
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,200
A month.

164
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,480
I'll give you a month to find a new mine.

165
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,680
I'll give you 25% of the profit.

166
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,690
That's a lot!

167
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,480
I'll keep my promise if you find a new mine.

168
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:01,800
Okay.

169
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,800
By the way,I think there is something that you should know.

170
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,040
Do say it.

171
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,320
Did you go to the mine again?

172
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,040
You still like it although you've been here for a long time.

173
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,240
My grandfather's ashes are still there.

174
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,200
The mine will be sold soon. I want to bid farewell to him.

175
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,520
Uncle Zhou,don't you think that my mother's decision...

176
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,720
...is too reckless?

177
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,480
Some mines take a longer time to produce the materials.

178
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,560
I think we can still give it a try.

179
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,360
I tried talking to her but...

180
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,520
...we didn't get a new stone for a long time. It'll be hard...

181
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,440
...to sell it if we drag this on.

182
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,130
Brother Zhuang Rui thinks that there is hope in the mine.

183
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,640
I agree with him.

184
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,720
Hopefully my mother will take his advice.

185
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,349
What did he find out?

186
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Uncle Zhou, can I ask you a question?

187
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,440
You're in charge of the mine...

188
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:21,069
...all these while.

189
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,829
Did you find out that something is wrong?

190
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,369
What did you say?

191
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,880
The sample was thrown away.

192
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:37,840
Look.

193
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,240
There is an obvious cutting mark on the stone...

194
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,960
...and the sign on it is identical with the lab.

195
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,800
We took the stone from the entrance of Kachin Hills.

196
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,080
The distance between the lab and the hills is far.

197
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,920
It's impossible for the stone to be accidentally dropped there.

198
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,980
What are you trying to say?

199
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,840
The stone is small and the cut is new.

200
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,940
It shows purple on it,too.

201
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,360
People with common sense...

202
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,840
...know that it is a good purple jade.

203
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,040
Getting a good jade from the mine...

204
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,540
...is a piece of good news.

205
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,740
Why didn't anyone inform you about it...

206
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,890
...but it was instead thrown away?

207
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,240
Someone is trying to keep it from me.

208
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,120
The sample is from the lab.

209
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,530
It couldn't be Old Zhou.

210
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,560
I trust our men.

211
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,780
In those years,...

212
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,280
...when we were having problems,...

213
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,760
...Old Zhou was the one who helped us.

214
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,480
He found a few mines for us,too.

215
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,080
I've said that I never make a wrong judgement in stones and men.

216
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,140
What about the others?

217
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,120
I'll find it out.

218
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,080
Did you find the sample?

219
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,000
Don't be anxious,Uncle Zhou. If it was done on purpose,...

220
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,200
...my mother will definitely find out.

221
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,840
Do you have the sample with you? May I have a look?

222
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,560
My mother should have it by now.

223
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,600
If the sample was from the lab,...

224
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,600
...it would be my fault.

225
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,080
I feel sorry for Director Hu.

226
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,720
Uncle Zhou,it wasn't your fault.

227
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,210
Someone must be trying to sabotage us.

228
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,320
We must teach him a lesson after we find him.

229
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,880
You're right. I must check the safety box.

230
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,240
Wenwen,please come and help me. -Okay.

231
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,770
Let's go.

232
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,000
It's me.

233
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,060
We have to postpone...

234
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,640
...the contract.

235
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,700
Wait for my notice.

236
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,760
What do you mean by you can't find Wenwen?

237
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,520
Find her now! -Yes.

238
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,560
What's wrong with Hu Wen? -She is missing.

239
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,220
The guards didn't see her leaving...

240
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,000
...but we couldn't find her.

241
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,040
Don't worry. She may be taking a stroll.

242
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,490
She'll be back soon.

243
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,320
Search again. -Yes.

244
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,960
Let go of my daughter!

245
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,480
I won't spare your life if you hurt Wenwen.

246
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,880
We can discuss it later.

247
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,640
Aunt Hu,what's going on?

248
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,960
He caught Wenwen. -Who is he?

249
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,690
He is Bo Gang.

250
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,000
He works with people from all walks of life.

251
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,500
It's very difficult to deal with him.

252
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,600
Is he holding a grudge against you?

253
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,920
He wants to take over the mine.

254
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:06,800
We know each other...

255
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,640
...through Old Zhou.

256
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,080
Bring Old Zhou here.

257
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,890
He did not come into work today.

258
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,240
His assistant came earlier.

259
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,800
You are right.

260
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,880
There is something wrong with the mine.

261
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,180
Aunt Hu,let's report this to the police.

262
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,600
No way. They are ruthless and Wenwen will be hurt.

263
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,280
Bo Gang...

264
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,800
...wants me to exchange Wenwen with the contract.

265
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,960
Old Zhou is their spy.

266
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,890
What shall we do now?

267
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,000
Bo Gang wants to meet me at the casino tomorrow.

268
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,600
Is Bo Gang going to keep his promise?

269
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,250
He may break his promise after getting the contract.

270
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,280
Who can ensure Wenwen's safety?

271
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:27,880
I can.

272
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,730
I can ensure her safety.

273
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,000
Do we have to dress up like this?

274
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,650
We have to act according to the situation.

275
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,440
Show us a few poses.

276
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:09,880
Pose.

277
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:13,840
Pose.

278
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,120
Be more feminine.

279
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,640
Show us a few more.

280
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:54,800
Feifei,you're great!

281
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,360
You can act accordingly.

282
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:02,480
You can handle different characters. Good!

283
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,960
Stop! What shall we do now?

284
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,120
Why are you still here? Get moving!

285
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,240
What shall I do? -Try to act it out.

286
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,800
Are you leaving the space...

287
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,920
...for me?

288
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,840
That's right!

289
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,600
Are you trying to...

290
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,320
...expose your identity?

291
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,680
Do you know what a couple is? Get closer!

292
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,360
Get closer!

293
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,960
Okay! Feifei,can you put your hand in Xiaorui's arm?

294
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,380
Move aside!

295
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,520
Watch me.

296
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,530
Do you get it?

297
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,250
Why don't you do it yourself? -I don't think you can stand me.

298
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,160
Stop! We don't have much time.

299
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,520
Tell us your plan.

300
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:48,000
You've taken up a lot of time. -The main point is the detail.

301
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,800
Didn't Bo Gang say that...

302
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:54,120
...Director Hu can bring Wenwen back after the deal?

303
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,080
Therefore,I think Wenwen is kept in the casino.

304
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,960
Two of you have to save her on time...

305
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,560
...by pretending as gamblers.

306
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,560
You'll be a perfect couple!

307
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,680
What will you do then? -That's right.

308
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,520
My job is to make the plans.

309
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,040
You'll stay outside and help us. -Perfect!

310
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,120
The casino is on the first floor. The lounge is on the second floor.

311
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,440
According to Boss Hu, a few rooms on the ground floor...

312
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,200
...are used to keep the gamblers who can't pay their debt.

313
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,060
Therefore,...

314
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,000
...they may keep Hu Wen there.

315
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,200
That should be the entrance to the ground floor.

316
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,840
Bo Gang is cunning. His men will keep an eye on her.

317
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,840
He'll have his most trusted man,...

318
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,720
...Kun Sha, to keep an eye on her.

319
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:00,240
I think you should take a bite.

320
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,920
How are we going to deal with your mother if you die?

321
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,000
Gambling is the best way...

322
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,730
...to distract Kun Sha.

323
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,010
Zhuang Rui will attract Kun Sha's attention.

324
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,400
With Kun Sha distracted, Feifei...

325
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,240
...will save Hu Wen.

326
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,000
Boss Hu will deal with Bo Gang...

327
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,360
...so that we have enough time to carry out our plan.

328
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,080
Old Zhou,how did I offend you?

329
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,840
Why do you have to do this to me?

330
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,160
Have you spared a thought for our friendship?

331
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,010
Did you say friendship?

332
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,360
Madam Hu,...

333
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,530
...isn't our relationship...

334
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,400
...built on the profit?

335
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,920
I've contributed a lot to your company over the years.

336
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:49,120
However,the profit that I got was too little.

337
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,210
Everything is based on the profit.

338
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,960
You've been doing business for so many years,...

339
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,040
...I'm quite sure that you can understand this.

340
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,600
You betrayed me...

341
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,240
...yet you don't feel guilty at all.

342
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:14,440
That's how it is in business but you must have a conscience.

343
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:21,200
You knew Wenwen since she was a child.

344
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,680
Don't you feel guilty to her?

345
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,680
However..... -Stop!

346
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,120
I don't think we should discuss about it now.

347
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,400
Madam Hu,you're very capable.

348
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,400
All of us know that.

349
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:45,000
Do you think...

350
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,690
...it's suitable for you to think about that now?

351
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,080
I think...

352
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,700
...you should sign the contract quickly...

353
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,080
...and bring your daughter back.

354
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,640
You may settle with him later on.

355
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,920
Stay here quietly for a few hours.

356
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:19,520
I'll let you go after the contract is signed.

357
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,800
If you act up,...

358
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,560
...then I'm forced to ruin your face.

359
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,320
What's wrong?

360
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,800
Boss,there is a gambler...

361
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,600
...who won for six rounds straight.

362
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,880
Now it's the 7th round. -Did he cheat?

363
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:54,080
We haven't confirmed it yet. -I'll go there now.

364
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,880
I think you should take a bite.

365
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,280
It has been half an hour. Why haven't they come out?

366
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,640
Don't be anxious. Be patient.

367
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,960
How can I be patient? It's dangerous!

368
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,970
They aren't well trained like you. What if they expose themselves?

369
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,160
I'll have a look. -Okay. Be careful.

370
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,010
You have to be careful,too.

371
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:26,760
Freeze!

372
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,040
Why are you here? -Xiaoyun told me to come here.

373
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,080
Feifei! -Feifei,let's save Miss Hu...

374
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,600
...before they find out.

375
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,440
Madam Hu,our mines are next to each other.

376
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,520
If you sell it to me,...

377
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,650
...it'll be perfect for me.

378
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,720
There are only a few pages. Do you have to read for so long?

379
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,960
Mr. Bo Gang,I'm a businesswoman.

380
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,520
I have to read the conditions in detail...

381
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,800
...to avoid any losses.

382
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,080
The contract is only used as part of the procedures.

383
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,160
We don't follow the contract.

384
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:47,920
Stop wasting time. Your daughter is still with me.

385
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,360
Boss,...

386
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,570
...I think something is wrong.

387
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,920
Hu Rong loves her daughter.

388
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,840
She doesn't have to consider for such a long time.

389
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,330
She has been reading the contract for a long time.

390
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,360
Is she trying to buy time?

391
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:48,920
I got it.

392
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,400
Close the door. No one is allowed to leave.

393
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,280
You stay right here!

394
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,330
Close the door. No one is allowed to leave.

395
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,720
No one is allowed to leave.
