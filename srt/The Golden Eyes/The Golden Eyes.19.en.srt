1
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,500
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,500
Episode 19

3
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,280
Count me in. -What are you talking about?

4
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,160
I know what you are planning to do.

5
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,320
I can help you out.

6
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,080
What do you need me to do?

7
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,600
Zhuang Rui did have a disagreement with Stevenson.

8
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,320
So he is the biggest suspect.

9
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,440
I think Zheng Hua is using this opportunity for revenge.

10
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,079
I know Zheng Hua well. He is not one...

11
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,079
...to take someone away just for revenge.

12
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,440
Besides,he has no evidence.

13
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:43,800
The problem is that he has the evidence.

14
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,120
A bloody dagger was found...

15
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,560
...under the bedside table in this room.

16
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,800
How can that be?

17
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,040
Wasn't he always with all of you?

18
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,280
You can be his witnesses.

19
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,840
No one believes us. A guest even accused us of being accomplices.

20
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,320
This is Zheng Hua's territory. The police might be on his side.

21
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,400
All the evidence are pointing towards him.

22
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,200
All we can do now is to find the real murderer.

23
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,320
This is the only way to prove his innocence.

24
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,800
For us to save Zhuang Rui,...

25
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,000
...we need to find all clues related to this.

26
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,079
Zhuang Rui mentioned that...

27
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,320
...the murderer's fingers were slashed.

28
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,480
The murderer's fingers?

29
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,400
How would he know that?

30
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,480
Why is there no reception here?

31
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,720
What's that sound?

32
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,480
Stevenson died around 3.00 p.m.

33
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,000
We can check the CCTV footage...

34
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,360
...outside his room.

35
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,440
I know where the control room is.

36
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,240
If that's the case, let's split up.

37
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,920
One team will look for clues, the rest will look for Zhuang Rui.

38
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,760
To be honest, I don't trust Zheng Hua.

39
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,200
We will save Zhuang Rui.

40
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,520
Why are you making the decisions? -It's not that.

41
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:09,040
You protect Miss Qin. I protect,no,he protects me.

42
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,760
It's all set. You'll plan what to do next.

43
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,520
Zhuang Rui was last seen at this location.

44
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,400
Looking at this floor plan,...

45
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,080
...he should be here.

46
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,120
Hold on,isn't that near the storeroom?

47
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,480
The man who played with him..... -He's the main suspect.

48
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,720
He's called Zhuang Rui.

49
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,400
I can't believe he killed him. -Maybe he lost the game.

50
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,680
Are you confident?

51
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,240
Room service.

52
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,520
Food is here. Come in!

53
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,640
Great,we can finally eat.

54
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,520
Can you do it?

55
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,800
The footage between 3.00 p.m. to 4.00 p.m. has been erased.

56
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,440
Look at that.

57
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,960
Zheng Hua is the murderer.

58
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,000
Don't worry about me. If it really was Zheng Hua,...

59
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,280
...no one can help him.

60
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,640
Can this footage be used as evidence?

61
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,840
The system's been locked. I can't copy it.

62
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,840
If we can find the clothes he was wearing,...

63
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,680
...he won't be able to escape.

64
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,880
His room is on the top floor to the left.

65
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,280
Stop! What are you doing?

66
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,840
We are making rounds.

67
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,480
You don't seem familiar. Are you new?

68
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,600
No,he came with Xiaohuang.

69
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,400
Which Xiaohuang? -Just some Xiaohuang.

70
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,080
Hurry up!

71
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,720
Just one punch, I'm impressed!

72
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,400
Could you come to my room?

73
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,920
What is it? I'm in bed already.

74
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,160
A lot have happened these few days.

75
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,640
I see things clearly now.

76
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,080
Could you come down here?

77
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,320
What are you saying?

78
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,400
I heard that...

79
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,640
...the murder weapon was found in Zhuang Rui's room.

80
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,480
I can't believe that he would do that.

81
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,760
I told you,...

82
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,280
...he does not belong in our world.

83
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,920
He is not as simple as we think.

84
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,400
You're right. Now a tragedy has happened.

85
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,160
All right, I won't disturb you.

86
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,920
Xuanbing, I'm not asleep yet.

87
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,160
Let's talk.

88
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,160
Stay in your room. I'll be right there.

89
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,920
All right.

90
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,320
Is it locked?

91
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,560
Xiaorui!

92
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Could Xiaorui be..... -No. Hurry up.

93
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,640
Xiaorui,are you in there?

94
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,560
Xiaoyun? Pengfei?

95
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,120
Is that you? -Xiaorui,are you all right?

96
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,600
I'm all right. Have you found anything?

97
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,640
Zheng Hua could be the murderer.

98
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,800
Got it.

99
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,720
Feifei and Miss Qin went to the control room...

100
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,000
...and are collecting evidence in Zheng Hua's room.

101
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,440
Xiaofei and I are here to save you because we're worried.

102
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,840
Thank you. I appreciate that.

103
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,360
All right. Do you know what is the floor above?

104
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,560
It should be the storeroom.

105
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,520
I see.

106
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,880
So the sounds I heard were people moving things.

107
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,920
Xuanbing,it's me.

108
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,800
Come in.

109
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,440
Xuanbing, when I left this room,...

110
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,400
...didn't I lock the door?

111
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,600
Room service came earlier. -Room service?

112
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,840
I was hungry so I ordered some food.

113
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,200
Where did the bodyguard go to?

114
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,560
What happened to your fingers?

115
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,400
It's nothing.

116
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,960
Goodness me!

117
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,880
So many antiquities.

118
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,160
Let me see.

119
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,440
How much are they worth?

120
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,040
Why did Xiaorui ask us to come here?

121
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,360
He must have his reasons.

122
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,920
What clues will we find here?

123
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,680
Xiaoyun,look over there.

124
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,589
How could you be so careless?

125
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,280
I cut myself when I was cutting fruits.

126
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,880
Xuanbing,didn't you have something to say to me?

127
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,520
What is it? -It's nothing,I was anxious.

128
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,680
Didn't you lock everybody in their rooms?

129
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,760
So you are the only one left to talk to.

130
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,440
Is there nothing else?

131
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,200
No.

132
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,960
I think too much.

133
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,920
What is it?

134
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,080
Please excuse me.

135
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,520
Listen up! Team 1,come to my room.

136
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,320
Team 2,go to the storeroom. Move now!

137
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,600
Both of you,check over there! -Okay.

138
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,480
Goodness.

139
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,680
What a big basement!

140
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,360
Let's check over there.

141
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,280
Looks like Zheng Hua is a smuggler.

142
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,600
You're right. No, I can't take the evidence.

143
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,040
Give it to me,hurry up.

144
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,520
Someone's coming. Xiaoyun,let's go.

145
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,120
Be careful.

146
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Stop.

147
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,160
Get moving.

148
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:06,800
Stop!

149
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,600
Mr. Zhuang,where do you think you're going?

150
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,600
The night view in Kiev is beautiful,...

151
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,080
...it's too bad that you won't be able to see it.

152
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,280
You killed Stevenson.

153
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,000
We can say it is a mistake.

154
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,360
However,if you kill me now, you will be a murderer.

155
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,360
Think about it.

156
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,400
No,you think about it.

157
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,040
Zhuang Rui had a disagreement with Stevenson...

158
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,480
...because of a gambling card game...

159
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,400
...and killed himself out of guilt after killing Stevenson.

160
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,280
What do you think?

161
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,560
You are using me as a scapegoat.

162
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,520
Don't say it like that.

163
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,080
If you hadn't exposed the cheating card dealer,...

164
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,800
...Stevenson wouldn't have died. So,you killed him.

165
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,720
If you want to fabricate my death as a suicide,...

166
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,360
...how do you explain the gun in my hand?

167
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,120
Who cares about that if the murderer is dead?

168
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,000
Do you think the police are dumb?

169
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,280
Are you all right?

170
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,320
Are all of you all right?

171
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,680
We're fine, thank you for asking.

172
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,560
Are you all right? -I'm fine.

173
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,160
For you, of course I'll be fine.

174
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,000
If you're fine, then I'll hang up.

175
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:03,040
You're worried about me. -I'm worried about Feifei!

176
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,800
Fine,I'm glad you're fine. I'm hanging up.

177
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:22,800
Zhuang Rui, I'm sorry about that.

178
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,920
The incident this time almost became a disaster.

179
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,240
It was like a calamity.

180
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,080
It's all right, don't worry about it.

181
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,240
Disasters often bring people closer.

182
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,640
Zhuang Rui,...

183
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,040
...you're a good man.

184
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,680
You mentioned about the Myanmar auction?

185
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:53,800
Yes,Myanmar holds the biggest jadeite auction.

186
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,240
For the past years, my father and I didn't do well...

187
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,320
...in the auction.

188
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,120
So my father was thinking about asking you to go with us.

189
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,040
To do what you did in the Pingzhou auction.

190
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,040
The thing is that.....

191
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,480
What is it?

192
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,840
What happened here was too sudden.

193
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,440
I am embarrassed to even mention the auction.

194
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,960
It's all right. Even if you didn't ask me,...

195
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,720
...I would've gone anyway. I want to open my eyes and mind.

196
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,880
So you agree to join us?

197
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:38,160
You left the door open. Your wound.....

198
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,560
What? Qin Xuanbing's house?

199
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,080
Mr. Qin invited him there. He will fly to Myanmar tonight.

200
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,040
He'll join us after treating his wounds. We'll go together.

201
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,960
We almost lost our lives at Zheng Hua's house.

202
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,240
Can we please ignore these upper class society?

203
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,040
Ignore?

204
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,920
Miss Qin is demure and polite. How can one ignore her?

205
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,040
What? Are you angry at Xiaorui? -Who's angry?

206
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,880
Why should I be angry?

207
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,760
If you're not angry, why are you walking so fast?

208
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,120
I'm hungry,all right?

209
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,160
Fine.

210
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,200
Let's go and find something to eat.

211
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,200
I want to eat chinese cuisine. -All right.

212
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,760
Peking duck. -Yes.

213
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,040
Red braised pork belly. -No problem.

214
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,040
Pork hocks. -All right.

215
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,160
Tomato fried egg, Moo Shu dish or Western food.

216
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:05,400
Some steak,fries and burgers are fine,too.

217
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,000
Two bottles of wine as well! I want to sleep after I drink!

218
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,800
With such a huge appetite,...

219
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,360
...how will she be able to compete with Miss Qin?

220
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,960
Am I right? -I want two steaks.

221
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,600
You! I'm not paying for anything.

222
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:09,920
Zhuang Rui!

223
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,640
I'll go over there.

224
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,160
The Myanmar jade merchants are having dinner tonight...

225
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,800
...to welcome us. My father wants you to join us.

226
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,880
He could introduce you to his industry friends.

227
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,160
All right.

228
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,040
Let's go.

229
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,600
Xiaozhuang,...

230
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,560
...get in the car.

231
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:42,760
Sure.

232
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,680
Feifei,get in the car.

233
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,680
I'll rely on you for this auction.

234
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,160
You have been nothing but kind to me.

235
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,360
I will do my best since you put your trust in me.

236
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,040
Anything interesting about the auction this time? Do tell me.

237
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,040
There is something.

238
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,240
I heard that...

239
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:36,040
...Xi Huang Jewellery has someone new called Zhuang Rui.

240
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,080
I asked around.

241
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,280
Zhuang Rui made a killing in the Pingzhou auction.

242
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,360
He made a name for himself in the industry and is a legend.

243
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,440
Interesting.

244
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,520
Most people who could discern jade are older people.

245
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,920
It's rare to have a young blood with this talent.

246
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,680
He is someone to be reckoned with.

247
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,320
I should meet with him someday.

248
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,360
Qin Haoran is bringing his daughter to dinner tonight.

249
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,040
Zhuang Rui will be present,too.

250
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,800
You can meet with him if you are interested.

251
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,680
I don't want to see Qin Haoran...

252
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,000
...and listen to his lengthy stories.

253
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,440
I've sent him a message to decline the invitation.

254
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,840
However,if I can meet this legendary young man,...

255
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,520
...maybe I should attend.

256
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,840
I hadn't expected so many people to attend the dinner.

257
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,600
Jade prices has increased the past two years,...

258
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,200
...and those who attend the auction are rich,...

259
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,720
...so much thought has been given to the dinners and auction.

260
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,150
The biggest boss at the Myanmar auction is Hu Rong.

261
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,840
Hu Rong? -Myanmar's largest mining area...

262
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:18,480
...is hers so she controls the jewellery market in SEA.

263
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,520
Her position and resources are equally strong.

264
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,480
I have heard of Hu Rong.

265
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,230
She is Xi Huang Jewellery's biggest rival.

266
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,630
Hu Rong keeps a low profile...

267
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:35,840
...but when she appears, she always succeeds.

268
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,880
We lost to her in auctions many times.

269
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,080
It's a good thing that we have you this time.

270
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,520
You flatter me. I tried my best...

271
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,120
...and got lucky at times.

272
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,040
You have the ability, you didn't get lucky.

273
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,440
We are the ones who got lucky for having you with us.

274
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,640
Zhuang Rui,do you think that we will always be lucky?

275
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,920
You're a nice person. I'm sure luck will always be on your side.

276
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,680
Zhuang Rui, you're a good person.

277
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:14,840
Am I?

278
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,480
Uncle Qin.

279
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,240
Uncle Qin.

280
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,600
Xiaozhuang,I'll introduce you to Hu Rong when she arrives.

281
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,200
All right.

282
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,080
You need to meet with her in Myanmar.

283
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,120
Hu Rong is a sly person but she is adept at stone gambling.

284
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,920
Both of you can talk about that. -All right.

285
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,440
My father and Hu Rong are old friends so don't worry.

286
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,760
Hu Rong is good with words...

287
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:07,120
...so you must be careful not to fall into her trap.

288
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,880
Okay,Uncle Qin.

289
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,160
Don't worry, my father will help you.

290
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,320
Hello.

291
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,560
Hello.

292
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,200
Director Qin, it's been a while.

293
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,840
Where's your boss? -I'm sorry about that.

294
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,640
My boss has an urgent matter to attend to at the last minute.

295
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:40,880
She couldn't make here...

296
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,960
...to personally welcome you.

297
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,200
She sent me here to apologize on her behalf.

298
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,800
She'll invite you to a private banquet.

299
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,200
Your boss always takes her job seriously.

300
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,840
It's just a meal. She didn't need to attend.

301
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,000
I wish her good health.

302
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,400
I'll pass on the message.

303
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,760
I shall take my leave now.

304
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,440
Please.

305
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:19,960
Father,isn't she being disrespectful to you?

306
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:25,240
Hu Rong is always up to tricks like this.

307
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,200
When will she get tired of these mind games?

308
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,480
Look at this woman.

309
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,240
Woman? Hu Rong is a woman? -Yes.

310
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:48,080
There are many women in the Myanmar jade industry.

311
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,920
However,she is the only one who made it this big.

312
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,320
I am always under her thumb...

313
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,840
...and can't even hold my head up high.

314
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,360
So Zhuang Rui,...

315
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,200
...I'm relying on you this time.

316
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,920
Yes,Uncle Qin. I'll do my best.

317
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,920
All right,both of you can enjoy yourselves. I'm going back.

318
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,360
Father,let me bring you to your room.

319
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,680
No need. Enjoy yourselves.

320
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,280
Thank you,Uncle Qin.

321
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,280
I'll get you a drink. -It's all right.

322
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,800
I'm feeling hungry. -Then I'll get you some food.

323
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,080
All right.

324
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,320
Xiaorui,what time does the auction start?

325
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,520
The auction is about to start soon.

326
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,400
Xuanbing will call for me. -I'm going with you.

327
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:04,240
I said,I'm going with you. -Where...

328
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,000
Going to the auction with you

329
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,600
I'm going to the auction with you.

330
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,280
Why are you going there?

331
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,400
Zhuang Rui,you hired me to be your bodyguard.

332
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,720
How could you simply decide where to go?

333
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,080
Did you ask for my permission?

334
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,200
It's only an auction. Are you really coming along?

335
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,480
Fine,I will not talk about the past.

336
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,760
However,from now on,I'll follow you wherever you go.

337
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,880
As your bodyguard, I must protect you.

338
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,200
I only have one entrance pass for the auction.

339
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,480
Can't you get another one? Since Xuanbing is so amazing,...

340
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,480
...ask her to get one for me.

341
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,040
Okay,I'm sure you have a lot to do.

342
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,560
I'll bring Feifei around. Off you go.

343
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:00,520
All right.

344
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,880
What? -I'll bring you around.

345
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,120
I'm his bodyguard so I have to be with him.

346
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,920
I'll bring you around for sightseeing in Myanmar.

347
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,800
We'll visit Shwedagon Pagoda and other places.

348
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,120
I'll buy you fruit juice to let off steam.

349
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,960
Who said I want that?

350
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,160
You're annoying. -Let's go.
