1
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,000
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 43

3
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,180
We are going to enter the desert soon.

4
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,440
My men will be here soon.

5
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:49,479
We will be staying here these 2 days.

6
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,130
This is the house of Peng Fei's friend.

7
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,780
Hi. Sister Kojima!

8
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,490
Kojima has arrived.

9
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,040
What do you mean?

10
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,400
Mr. Nakagawa heard that you really like this knife...

11
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,460
...and asked me to bring this for you.

12
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,900
It's Mr. Nakagawa's good intention.

13
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,440
Hurry and keep it.

14
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,520
Thank you.

15
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,280
Peng Fei,this is Mr. Nakagawa's assistant,Kojima Akiko.

16
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,240
Both of them are cold. They seem to match each other.

17
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,780
The preparations are almost done. We can leave now.

18
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,000
Hello,Miss Xiaojia.

19
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,280
I really miss you.

20
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,880
Are you going to the desert again tomorrow?

21
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,480
We are leaving tomorrow. -You must check the vehicle.

22
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,440
You don't want it to break down. -No,we are not driving this time.

23
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,840
Not driving?

24
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,920
Then,you have to check your luggage and materials.

25
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,240
Bring water and also sand, dust and heat-resistant items.

26
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,440
Bring more food,understand? -Yes,Miss Xiaojia. Don't worry.

27
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,079
I love you.

28
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,120
You're jealous. -Hurry and pack your things.

29
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,120
Xiaofei,I have a feeling that in this trip to the desert,...

30
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,250
...you will also meet someone.

31
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,120
This weather does not look good.

32
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,880
There may be a strong wind in a while.

33
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,800
Sister Kojima, Aoyama is your husband,right?

34
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,800
No,he is my work partner.

35
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,360
I asked her,you have a chance. -What you are talking about?

36
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,880
See,you are pretending to not understand.

37
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,320
Are you staying here? -I'm only here to ask.

38
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,780
There is a man surname Zhuang who lives here.

39
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,440
They went out. Do you need anything?

40
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,960
They have helped me before. I came to thank them.

41
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,720
I see. They will be back...

42
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,640
...but I don't know when.

43
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,720
Then,I'll wait. -Sure,make yourself comfortable.

44
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,960
Boss. -Thank you.

45
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,520
Thank you.

46
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,440
Saiya, you have worked hard today.

47
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,170
Drink some water. Here.

48
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,040
Here. Drink water.

49
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,360
Can we see mirage in the desert today?

50
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
At the desert,...

51
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,120
...everything depends on luck.

52
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,730
Huang Fuyun!

53
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,120
Huang Fuyun!

54
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,720
Why is there no water?

55
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,050
I checked yesterday. It was full of water.

56
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,440
You did not tighten the bottle cap. The water all leaked out.

57
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,640
Impossible, I tightened it yesterday.

58
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,880
This looks like something you do. You cannot even do this properly.

59
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,640
How are you going to be responsible for life lost?

60
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,800
Xiaorui!

61
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,000
You believe me,right?

62
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,440
Saiya,be my witness!

63
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,620
Did I not tighten the cover properly yesterday?

64
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,000
You ungrateful being! I even gave you water yesterday!

65
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,200
Boss,we still have 4 bottles.

66
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,580
How can 4 bottles be enough? Let's go back and pack more.

67
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,320
Then.....

68
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,080
We can still survive without food in the desert.

69
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,680
If there is no water, we cannot survive.

70
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,000
Then,let's return and bring some materials and water here.

71
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,050
If we go back now,we cannot make it in time for the supermoon.

72
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,320
Old Zeng,you are familiar with the desert. What should we do?

73
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,280
We are surrounded by highlands.

74
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,620
We can only head to low points to find a water source.

75
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,450
It's more important to find water now.

76
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,720
Could it really be me?

77
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,080
I remember I did tightened it.

78
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,840
Saiya,think again.

79
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,210
Didn't I tighten it?

80
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,820
What are you thinking?

81
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,760
I'm thinking that Xiaoyun would not be this careless.

82
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,000
Then,you are saying that...

83
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,210
...someone poured the water while we were sleeping.

84
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,960
I dare not be certain but we must be careful.

85
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,480
Stop thinking. Old Zeng is experienced and will find water.

86
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,330
It's my fault, searching for the cave temple.

87
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,000
Everyone has to suffer with me. -It's not that serious.

88
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,720
Can't you see that everyone is well?

89
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,960
Since all of you met me,...

90
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,540
...you often suffer and are involved in many troubles.

91
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,420
I'm really sorry. -That's right.

92
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,760
After meeting you,...

93
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,740
...I've experienced things which I never thought before.

94
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,760
However,I think its wonderful.

95
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,080
It's all right. What haven't we faced before?

96
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,840
I really did tightened it.

97
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,240
I know.

98
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,800
We will find water.

99
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,560
There's water! There's water here!

100
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,840
Water! -Water!

101
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,360
Water! -There's really water!

102
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:17,920
Hurry!

103
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,280
How is it? -Miss.

104
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:32,160
Zhuang Rui and others drank the water. They'll sleep for a while.

105
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,000
We can enter the cave temple first to obtain the items.

106
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,200
Okay,I know.

107
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,040
Kojima!

108
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,000
Feifei!

109
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,240
Old Zeng! Xiaoyun! Xiaofei!

110
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,000
Old Zeng!

111
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,320
No,Xiaoyun! Xiaofei! Old Zeng!

112
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,450
What is going on?

113
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,840
I know. The water is the problem.

114
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,330
There is no poison in the water.

115
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,720
If there is, the sand would've changed.

116
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,520
Forget that. Let's wake the others up.

117
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,980
The Supermoon will be out soon. We have to find the cave temple.

118
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,000
Xiaoyun! Wake up,Xiaoyun!

119
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Xiaofei! Wake up.

120
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,480
What happened? -Kojima!

121
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,200
Kojima,wake up! Here.

122
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,760
Feifei!

123
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:12,840
Quick!

124
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,040
A team will stay behind,hide the car. Don't let them see you.

125
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,120
The rest of you, follow me inside.

126
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,440
No,what is the problem with this water?

127
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,800
I have suspected,even if Xiaoyun is careless,...

128
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,460
...he will not forget to tighten the bottle cap.

129
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,760
So,from the current situation,...

130
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,690
...someone must have purposely poured our water...

131
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,800
...so we will search for a water source.

132
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,260
So,they did something to this water source.

133
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,880
It is not poison inside the water. It is anaesthetic.

134
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,320
The person who did it is not trying to poison us...

135
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,520
...but to make us sleep and drag our time.

136
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,280
Old Zeng,are we far from the cave temple?

137
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,530
We shouldn't be far.

138
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,840
We must leave immediately. -Sure.

139
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,560
Let's go.

140
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,220
We found it!

141
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,880
We found it! -It's similar to 24 years ago.

142
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,080
You must hurry. The caves will disappear when the sun rises.

143
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,640
You must be careful. -Okay.

144
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,370
Since we are being watched, we need people to guard outside.

145
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,610
Old Zeng,you will handle this. -Okay.

146
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,480
Aoyama,you also guard outside.

147
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,560
If anything's strange,inform us. -Yes.

148
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,160
We must return before sunrise. Let's go.

149
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,760
Let's go.

150
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:11,920
Let's go. We will go there.

151
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,840
Xiaorui, I think it's gloomy here.

152
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,920
Look,there's a door here.

153
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,210
What is this?

154
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,200
This must be a lock with password.

155
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,640
A lock with password?

156
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,520
There are 3 pictures on the surface.

157
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,940
Characters are engraved on them.

158
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,180
However,because a long time has passed,...

159
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,400
...it's no longer clear now.

160
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,970
If I'm not mistaken,...

161
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:25,120
...if we match the 3 gaps which are not easily spotted,...

162
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,200
...and point towards Kun orientation,...

163
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,960
...the door will open. -Gaps?

164
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,290
There's none. -Where are the gaps?

165
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,600
You will not see it for sure. You aren't meticulous.

166
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,240
Xiaorui,where are the gaps? -Here.

167
00:28:41,320 --> 00:29:26,840
Here,move back.

168
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,800
Thank you,Boss Zhuang for helping me to open the door.

169
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,920
Both of you cooperate very well.

170
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,100
Be careful!

171
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,200
Don't move!

172
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,160
You're good at fighting.

173
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,560
If you move, I will hit you to death.

174
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,000
Go! Move aside!

175
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,570
You must be from the Qin family.

176
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,660
I'm also someone who can save you.

177
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,820
You must be the one who puts anaesthetic in the water...

178
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,240
...to stop us and for you to come here first.

179
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,050
Why didn't you open the door when you arrived?

180
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,800
I have to bring you inside.

181
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,410
Let's go.

182
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,900
I have a condition.

183
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,610
Who are you to discuss conditions with me?

184
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,800
What gives you the right to talk to me about this?

185
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,160
It's because I can bring you in safely.

186
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,240
I hope you will not hurt them.

187
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,480
It depends on my mood.

188
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,680
Go in! Hurry!

189
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,800
We have to hurry.

190
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,480
Get up! Quick!

191
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,000
Over here! Hurry!

192
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,760
Are you alright,Peng Fei? -Yes.

193
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,080
Let's go. Don't disturb them. -Be careful.

194
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,409
Is this the cave that we are searching for?

195
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,800
It should be this one.

196
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,900
It will be painful. Withstand it for a while.

197
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,440
Never thought you held it in. -I'm used to it.

198
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:11,960
Me,too.

199
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,880
I'm sorry to disturb. -What is it?

200
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,400
Big brother,bless us. We are to leave safely.

201
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,000
"Wang Chao"

202
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,780
I have seen this person's name...

203
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,280
...in Grandfather Gu's information.

204
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,280
"Feng Quan Tomb Information"

205
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,720
Could they be searching for the secret of Feng Quan Tomb here?

206
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,600
Feng Quan?

207
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,410
What Feng Quan Tomb?

208
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,200
Xiaorui,is it similar to yours?

209
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,040
Mr. Nakagawa said,...

210
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,560
...the cave is key to unlocking the secret to The Golden Eyes.

211
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,980
Could it be that...

212
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,300
...those that happened are related to The Golden Eyes?

213
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,040
Is this a letter?

214
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,360
This.....

215
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,530
They must have met with the supermoon.

216
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,700
In order to hide from the sandstorm,they came here.

217
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,980
However,this letter was not completed.

218
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,780
Judging from this situation,...

219
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,040
...I think...

220
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,600
...the sands poured in the day and the researchers ran away.

221
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:14,320
They then left these information behind.

222
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,200
Nakagawa Ryosuke's father said something important was left here.

223
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:24,680
Could they have dropped the item here when they left in a hurry...

224
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,460
...and wanted to find it back?

225
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,920
Then we must search thoroughly.

226
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,210
I know what you think. You want to find grandfather's clues.

227
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,120
But aren't we getting closer to the truth now?

228
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,600
Xiaoyun,Xiaofei,help me to push the stone statue back.

229
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,680
What is it?

230
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,320
What?

231
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,890
I suspect there are things underneath it.

232
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,080
I'm sorry.

233
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,900
Sorry for disturbing.

234
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:53,920
Here.

235
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,920
What map is this?

236
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,560
If the archaeological team wanted to find Feng Quan Tomb,...

237
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,000
...this should be the map to the tomb.

238
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,700
Since we have found the item, let's hurry and find a way out.

239
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,120
The Qin family's men will be here. -Sure.

240
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,000
Let's go.

241
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,410
Hurry and go.

242
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,340
Don't move!

243
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,400
Thank you.

244
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,200
What..... -I know...

245
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,880
...you will help me to bring the map.

246
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:12,760
How is it?

247
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,760
What should we do?

248
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,120
Boss!

249
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,760
Here. -Quick!

250
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,480
Quick! The sands are coming in!

251
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:48,800
Hurry and go! Quick!

252
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,080
Quick!

253
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,240
Hurry!

254
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,200
Quick!

255
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,360
Hurry and come out! Hurry up!

256
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:09,040
Hurry! Run!

257
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,800
Run! Hurry!

258
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,680
I'm scared to death. -Hurry!
