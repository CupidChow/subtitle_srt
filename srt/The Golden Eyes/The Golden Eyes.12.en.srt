1
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,000
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Episode 12

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,200
However,from what I've heard,...

4
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,640
...Hpakant stones...

5
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,520
...have been mined to depletion now.

6
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,479
Why do you have so many of them?

7
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,440
You're right.

8
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,120
What you just mentioned is Hpakant stones from the old mine.

9
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,600
They're known as black sand due to its coal black outer layer.

10
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,400
You know that,right?

11
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,400
You know,too,that the mine was discovered much earlier.

12
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,910
It's been mined down to tens of meters deep...

13
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,240
...and it's already struck bedstone. Can't go any further.

14
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,920
These stones are certainly not Hpakant stones,...

15
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,600
...but they're indeed mined in Hpakant.

16
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,440
These stones are dug out from the new mines.

17
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,920
These Hpakant stones...

18
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,200
...may be from the new mines but they are not a bad gamble.

19
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,040
Please give us a minute. -Come here.

20
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,000
This stone is not bad. Buy it if you want to.

21
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,360
Isn't he that rogue who made a scene at our exhibition booth?

22
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,480
Look at what he got at the Stone Dissecting Room.

23
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:22,960
Let's go.

24
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,320
Miss Qin.

25
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,760
The female cop from Beijing has found Xu Wei's car here.

26
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,200
Your plan is working.

27
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,840
Xu Wei's touchstone is showing signs of activity.

28
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,280
This confirms that the police has discovered our past clue.

29
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,440
They won't figure out the reason from Xu Wei's trail.

30
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,720
Even if they didn't figure it out, the Xu name will be smeared.

31
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,560
Our boss wants to break into the mainland market.

32
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,840
Xu Corporation is his biggest rival.

33
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,360
Xu Corporation getting slapped with a lawsuit...

34
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,920
...will certainly be to our benefit.

35
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,960
Do you know why we're doing this?

36
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,520
You didn't do a clean job by failing to get rid of the car.

37
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,400
The police ended up with a shot of your face from the back.

38
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,120
I hope you'll be more professional.

39
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,920
I'm sorry,Miss Qin. The police are everywhere.

40
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,720
Make preparations these few days.

41
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,080
Go abroad and lie low for a bit. -Okay.

42
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,880
One shouldn't burn oneself when playing with fire.

43
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,600
Take this as a lesson.

44
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,400
Uncle,I was helping a friend.

45
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,560
This matter won't implicate the Xu family.

46
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,360
Smart alec.

47
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,560
Don't think that others can't figure it out.

48
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:21,760
Yes.

49
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,680
You need to know what's important and what's not.

50
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,480
The sealed-bid auction is most important,especially that stone.

51
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,040
Let go of the other things if possible.

52
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,080
Don't worry,uncle. I have it all arranged.

53
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,080
I've contacted Director Zhang of the association.

54
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,360
This event will be held at the museum.

55
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,440
Invitation cards are a must so the small investors can't enter.

56
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,120
I don't need to remind you to be careful around Director Zhang.

57
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,880
I personally contacted him and gave him cash.

58
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,680
How's it going with Miss Qin?

59
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,720
Very well. I've been keeping her happy all this time.

60
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,000
Let me warn you,Xiaowei.

61
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,440
This girl is not to be trifled with.

62
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,760
She's more dangerous than you imagine.

63
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,120
She's a thorny rose.

64
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,400
We don't know yet what the Qin Enterprise is scheming.

65
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,040
You need to keep it under control. -Don't worry about this.

66
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,160
Where you're concerned, I can't help but worry.

67
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,680
I'd have done it myself if I were younger.

68
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:40,880
Yes.

69
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:54,960
Hello.

70
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,640
Are you Miss Qin from Xi Huang Gems?

71
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,360
Yes. -I'm a staff of this event.

72
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,000
This invitation card is for you.

73
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,520
An invitation card? We've never had this before.

74
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,520
The venue for the sealed-bid auction has been changed.

75
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,440
It'll be held at the museum, and only invited guests...

76
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,640
...are allowed in. -Okay,I understand. Thank you.

77
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:37,360
Jiajia,did you know that I open two jade-filled stones today?

78
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,120
The boss was so happy he could fire a cannon in my honour.

79
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,280
What are you so proud about? It was Zhuang Rui's suggestion.

80
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,520
There's no distinction between Zhuang Rui and I.

81
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,600
We are inseparable,like two beans in a pod. Am I right?

82
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,720
Two peas in a pod.

83
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,840
What a coincidence.

84
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,680
We all meet up in Pingzhou and it's still the four of us.

85
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,640
Double date.

86
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,800
Double date.

87
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,280
Double date.

88
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,880
Zhuang Rui..... - Sorry.

89
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,120
I need to take this.

90
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,240
Hello,Xuanbing?

91
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,760
Xuanbing? Qin Xuanbing?

92
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,520
One look at her and you know she's a cold woman.

93
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,120
You can tell from her face that she's a seductress.

94
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,000
What does Zhuang Rui see in her...

95
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,520
...to ignore a beauty like me?

96
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,200
Don't tell me you.....him?

97
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,960
I'm sorry,everybody.

98
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,240
I have to leave now.

99
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,600
You're leaving already? We seldom get together like this.

100
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,240
Xuanbing told me that something important...

101
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,280
...has cropped up regarding the event tomorrow.

102
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,600
So,I'll get going. -You.....

103
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,440
That's nice of you. -Feifei.

104
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,120
Why is Zhuang Rui such a weakling?

105
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,560
I'm going,too. -Feifei?

106
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:46,880
Feifei!

107
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,880
Silly girl.

108
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,040
Only you.....

109
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,160
Don't worry,I'm not leaving.

110
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,400
What are you staring at? Drink up. -Let's drink.

111
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,240
Were you at the venue of the event throughout the day today?

112
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,120
That's right.

113
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,320
I know Huang Fuyun's level.

114
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,920
He couldn't have said those words.

115
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,760
Besides,I saw him having a Bluetooth device on.

116
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,400
Aren't you afraid of offending the Xu family doing this?

117
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,120
Actually,it's a good thing.

118
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,680
It showed that they were swindling the small investors.

119
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,160
There's bound to be someone who would speak out.

120
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,160
Grandpa Gu did say...

121
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,760
...that company can no longer enter Pingzhou's market.

122
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,360
Bingbing,aren't they afraid of bringing...

123
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,480
...the criticism of the investors upon themselves by doing this?

124
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,280
The Xu Corporation is a leader in the jade artifact industry.

125
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,680
To them,small matters like this are insignificant.

126
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,720
Moreover,their behaviour today...

127
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,360
...is just the petty tricks of Xu Wei and Yue Qun.

128
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,200
Xu Zhendong won't pay attention to it. Besides,...

129
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,720
...this is not their primary goal.

130
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,840
What's their goal,then? -The sealed-bid auction.

131
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,840
Xu Corporation has been winning the sealed-bid auction for years.

132
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,640
They are very close to the host,so this year,...

133
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,520
...they've begun implementing an access system.

134
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,360
Access system? -That's right.

135
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,440
This year's auction venue has been moved to the museum.

136
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,720
Everyone attending the event has to possess an invitation card...

137
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,440
...before he can enter. -Invitation card?

138
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,520
The small investors have no chance in the sealed-bid auction.

139
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,400
That's right. This is their way to attain their purpose,...

140
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,680
...which is to reduce the bidders for that day...

141
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,840
...and guarantee their win.

142
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,760
I'll keep up with you.

143
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,480
You've got a high alcohol tolerance.

144
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,120
In the past,I believed that impartiality

145
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,280
is the jade industry's path to development.

146
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,880
I was wrong.

147
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,280
I realize it's only those blinded by greed like the Xu family...

148
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,520
...who will benefit from this.

149
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,520
Even though I can't bear to see the way they handle things,...

150
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,280
...there's nothing I can do.

151
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,040
My father and I discussed about this.

152
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,400
We've decided to give it to you.

153
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,080
Why are you giving it to me? -These two years,the resources...

154
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,120
...of rough stones in the jade market doesn't meet the demands.

155
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,920
The Qin and Xu families are big corporations.

156
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,760
If reserves for the market aren't enough,there'll be a decline.

157
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,320
Xu Corporation is intent on obtaining the No. 0 Jade.

158
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,440
My family also came because of this jade,...

159
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,360
...but a mighty dragon can't crush a snake in it's old haunts.

160
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,640
If it was the mainland market, we need not compete with the Xus.

161
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,200
I hope we can borrow your ability...

162
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,720
...to restore fairness to the jade industry.

163
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,920
You've really over-estimated me.

164
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:20,360
Don't be modest. Who in the jade world doesn't know your name now?

165
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,560
You're now a legend in the jade world.

166
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,920
Please,you flatter me.

167
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,000
The jade industry is full of legendary roles.

168
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,440
That's why everyone believes in...

169
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,800
...and hopes for a miracle.

170
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,960
This year,you're the greatest miracle in the jade industry.

171
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,240
You've no idea how many want to employ you as their consultant.

172
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,440
If it wasn't because I know you, you'd have been unreachable.

173
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,600
Please don't say that.

174
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,040
Is it not enough? Do you want to hear more?

175
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,680
No,you flatter me.

176
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,000
I notice you and that young director...

177
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,720
...of Xu Corporation seem to have a.....

178
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,360
It's an evil necessity for the sake of business.

179
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,200
I told you,they're the big boss of the mainland's jade industry.

180
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,440
If my family wants to advance in the mainland,...

181
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,600
...we need to maintain friendly relations with them.

182
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,360
Otherwise,it'll be difficult for us.

183
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,720
Father has worked so hard. I just want to help him.

184
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,400
I see. I understand now. -Understand what?

185
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,000
Well,I understand that...

186
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,920
...sealed-bid auction No. 0 is very important to you.

187
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,440
These two years,raw material in the jade industry...

188
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,280
...is in short supply. Everyone's been stocking up on rough stones.

189
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,560
That's why the Qins and Xus...

190
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,640
...have been vying for raw jade material.

191
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,360
In the future,whoever has the most jadeites and rough stones...

192
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,640
...will gain a foothold. -Okay,Bingbing. I'll do my best.

193
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,520
However,I dare not guarantee.

194
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,440
You doing your best is the greatest guarantee to me.

195
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,800
You know what,Zhuang Rui?

196
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,200
Every time you determine a rough stone,your actions seem like...

197
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,109
...you can see right through the internal structure of the stone.

198
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:15,589
It's really amazing.

199
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,589
I'll tell you a secret.

200
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,840
I'm able to get it right every time...

201
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,440
...because.....

202
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,040
I have a pair of all-seeing eyes that can penetrate jadeite.

203
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,600
Zhuang Rui,you've got a real sense of humour!

204
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,720
Don't panic. Take deep breaths.

205
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,520
I'll think of something.

206
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,120
Zhuang Rui is so nice.

207
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,280
I'm a very nice person,too.

208
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,480
You are inadequate with words.

209
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,560
You can take up any topic of conversation.

210
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,040
Your jokes...

211
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,480
...are not funny at all.

212
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,480
Your boasting isn't the least bit impressive.

213
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,040
Why is it that.....

214
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,920
Why do I...

215
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,320
...remember everything you say?

216
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,080
Where did you go last night?

217
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,280
Stop pretending.

218
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,560
Where did you go last night?

219
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,480
Last night?

220
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,480
I drank too much last night.

221
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,880
I really don't know what to say about this.

222
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,080
It's okay. Don't say anything if you don't know what to say.

223
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,400
I understand it,more or less.

224
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,800
Sit down.

225
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:01,920
Brother Ma?

226
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,560
What's the matter?

227
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,120
I knew those rogues will do such a thing.

228
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,400
Hold the bid if you want to.

229
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,040
What's with the access system? DO you think this is World Cup?

230
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,720
Access system? What's that?

231
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,840
Get me a glass of water.

232
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,080
No,tell us what happened first.

233
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,120
The organizers of the event changed the venue...

234
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,120
...to the museum and for this event,they arranged it...

235
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,640
...to be open to invited guests only.

236
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
No one can attend without an invitation card.

237
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,480
Have they gone mad?

238
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,040
Forget about the bidding, we can't even get in!

239
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,680
What's the problem? Just get someone to make an invitation.

240
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,080
Are you Superman? How can you make one?

241
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,800
Where will you get it from?

242
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,360
My forehead is all sweaty.

243
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,880
Brother Ma,the thing is...

244
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,600
...I have an admission ticket.

245
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,000
Look at that. Xiaorui is indeed highly esteemed.

246
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,600
Where did you get it? -Xuanbing gave it to me.

247
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,200
Let's not get worked up over who gave this.

248
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,200
There's just one and we're three. Doesn't matter if he doesn't go.

249
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,120
There's still not enough.

250
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,880
That's why the sealed-bid auction event...

251
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,200
...has been rigorously managed.

252
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,600
All invitation cards are given to VIP clients...

253
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,320
...and there weren't many given out.

254
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,000
They look down on us small investors who haven't much money.

255
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,520
They've sorely underestimated the working class's intelligence.

256
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,080
Just watch.

257
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,360
Uncle,something happened at the sealed-bid auction venue.

258
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,480
Some invitation cards, I don't know how they got it.

259
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,760
They're all lining up to enter the building.

260
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,760
What are you panicking about? Just throw out the fake ones.

261
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,000
Yes but they all have our special anti-counterfeit code.

262
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,160
I don't know how they got it.

263
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,040
Safety checks failed to block them.

264
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,600
What are we to do now? -You can't even handle this.

265
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,360
I'm sorry. I was careless.

266
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,840
Looks like someone's deliberately working against us.

267
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,160
I understand what you mean. I'll go deal with it now.

268
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,160
Everything must go as originally planned.

269
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,280
Forget about the small investors.

270
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:59,120
Focus all your energy on the auction.

271
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,040
Do everything possible to get any material that's good.

272
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,160
At all times,take notice of the movements of No. 0's bidder.

273
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,200
Xu Corporation must win this time.

274
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,480
I'll go see to it now. Let's go.

275
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,000
Hello. -Hello.

276
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,800
Okay. - Hello. This way,please.

277
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,200
Hello. -This way,please.

278
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,080
Hello. -Hello.

279
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,000
Please. -Please enter.

280
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:42,680
Hello.

281
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,640
Why are you following me? -Please.

282
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,400
Hurry to the entrance to look for any clue.

283
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,960
Yes. -Next,please.

284
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,600
Please enter. -Hello.

285
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,240
Okay,please enter. -Welcome.

286
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,000
Please enter. -Hello.

287
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,160
Hello,please enter. -Please enter.

288
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,120
You certainly gave me a big surprise today!

289
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,000
Hello. -You managed to come up with...

290
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,760
...so many in such a short time.

291
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,600
Director Xu will be in a tizzy. -You may come this way,too.

292
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,600
A good thing Zhuang Rui had a sample.

293
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,920
This thing is no longer of value.

294
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,640
I can produce them as many as needed.

295
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,720
There's not one bit of technology involved.

296
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,040
Did they think a QR code is a good enough security measure?

297
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,400
Rich people like us have high IQs.

298
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,640
Well done. I'll reward you for this.

299
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,200
I'll treat you to good food. -It's a deal.

300
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,880
What's with the resentful look?

301
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,040
Uncle De said once that jade has five qualities.

302
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,600
One of it is the word "just".

303
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,000
Jade is the same inside out.

304
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,400
It's beautiful in and out. It has good faith and virtue.

305
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,320
That's right. That's what it is now.

306
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,080
Leave aside the ancient times. We're the three musketeers today.

307
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,840
Swordsmen.

308
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,280
What do you think?

309
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:11,040
Another quality is courage. It would rather break than bend.

310
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,360
I'm not sure if I can do it. After entering the jade world,...

311
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:19,320
...we've seen and learned a lot. We gambled like everyone else...

312
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,800
...and revere this circle.

313
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,640
We've also experienced the joy of success and the agony of failure.

314
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,800
We've seen money that we've never seen in a lifetime.

315
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:33,080
Now,starting from Brother Ma's piece of stone.

316
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,760
In spite of ourselves,we've been involved in some dirty dealings.

317
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,960
A few times,our friends were fortunate to avert disaster.

318
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:45,240
If luck hadn't been on our side, we would have to admit defeat...

319
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,400
...and get trampled on.

320
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,880
That's true. It's a good thing our friends had been lucky.

321
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,200
Look at them. They've been swindled yet they show gratitude.

322
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,960
The Xus are such wretched people.

323
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,520
Surely they won't act up in this event? Is anyone managing them?

324
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,120
Looks like the whole industry has been monopolized by a few people.

325
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,640
Fairness has been lost long ago.

326
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,800
The small investors may be many but its base is flimsy.

327
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,720
Even if they know something's fishy with this auction,...

328
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,920
...they can't contend.

329
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,520
Then.....

330
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,920
Even if all of us go in there, there's nothing we can do?

331
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,640
Do we just let those rich families earn dirty money?

332
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,360
The first step is to at least let those who think they can...

333
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,720
...destroy the small investors they like,to know that...

334
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,080
...the money they want is not easy to come by.

335
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,120
Please enter.

336
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,040
You can get scanned here,too. -Please enter.

337
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,280
Okay. -Please enter,gentlemen.

338
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,960
Hello. -Hello,please enter.

339
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,200
Hello.

340
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,800
Feifei,you look so haggard.

341
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,520
You couldn't sleep again last night?

342
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,480
It's nothing. I think it's just a stiff neck.

343
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,640
Look at you. Is it so good being a workaholic?

344
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,360
You've got the audacity to lecture me.

345
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:28,400
Where did you go...

346
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,200
...and who were you with last night?

347
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,520
What time did you return?

348
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,760
What's this? Treating me like a criminal now?

349
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,080
Don't think I don't know. It's Huang Fuyun,am I right?

350
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,640
The two of you..... -You just eat up.

351
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,440
The two of you didn't.....

352
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,920
I feel that Zhuang Rui...

353
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,720
...is actually not very suitable for me.

354
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,960
Seems like he's got his head in the clouds the whole day.

355
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:19,800
He stares at those stones,takes no initiative and isn't tactful.

356
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,760
What are you angry with a wooden stump for?

357
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,680
From today onwards, I've decided that...

358
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,640
...even if I blacklist him, there's definitely no hope.

359
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,640
Yes,you're so pretty. Everything you say is right.

360
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,400
I'm only telling you.

361
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,720
Just remember what I said, that's all.

362
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,680
What is this? -How is it?

363
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,640
Look at this path here. Is it a split or a skein?

364
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,280
This is the man.

365
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,720
Zoom in. -Okay.

366
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,440
Zhuang Rui.

367
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,320
I checked the monitors. He was also next to Director Yue's booth.

368
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,480
He's acting very suspicious.

369
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,160
Director Xu,I also checked yesterday's monitors.

370
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,800
He also appeared at other stalls.

371
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,080
He's acting furtive.

372
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,640
Zhuang Rui.

373
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,840
You were indeed behind this.

374
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,360
He instigated the small investors and made fake invitation cards.

375
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,800
Zhuang Rui.

376
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,320
Gu Tianfeng's godson. -I've verified it.

377
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,600
There's always trouble wherever he appears.

378
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,160
He dares to oppose us? He must tired of living.

379
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,960
I think he's courageous. He dares to do what he thinks up.

380
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,640
Gu Tianfeng is old but vigorous. His mind is dangerously sharp.

381
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,280
He's really found himself a young successor.

382
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,080
To me,he's just some nameless offal.

383
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:50,520
Impatient and careless.

384
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,680
Always too quick with your tongue. You should always think first.

385
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,880
Yes. -Send him a message.

386
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,120
Tell him I'd like to invite him for some tea tonight.

387
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,560
Uncle.

388
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,480
I don't understand why you're giving him so many chances.

389
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,960
Aren't you encouraging him to become more cocky?

390
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,400
Xiaowei.

391
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,840
I'm getting old.

392
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,400
The future of Xu Corporation will be on your shoulders.

393
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:32,920
Yes.

394
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,800
I'm always exasperated that you don't live up to my expectations.

395
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,480
The policies of the jade market is getting old. It needs fresh blood.

396
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,040
It's been years since I saw such a promising youngster.

397
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:50,040
There's no such thing as an eternal foe,only eternal profit.

398
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,670
The Xu Corporation came out to trade for the sake of profit.

399
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,160
Don't simply make an enemy of people.

400
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,680
Especially powerful enemies.

401
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,480
I understand.

402
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,000
Make friends with him.

403
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,480
It'll be beneficial to you.

404
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,240
Yes.

405
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,320
Hello.

406
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,640
Invite Zhuang Rui over. Tell him Director Xu wishes to have tea.

407
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,680
Yes. -One more thing.

408
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,880
Tell Pengfei to come over. I need him for a job.

409
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:50,640
Yes.

410
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,640
Xiaozhuang,you must've gained a lot at this event.

411
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,040
You got the best of Hou Jiang's Hpakant stones all the time.

412
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,520
No wonder President Gu esteems you highly. A gifted man like you...

413
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,440
...is very hard to find among the jade circle now.

414
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,320
You flatter me,Director Xu.

415
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,720
However,you need to remember.

416
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,040
Too much water drowned the miller.

417
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,200
Being in the limelight may not be a good thing.

418
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:34,840
Then.....

419
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,280
Please teach me,Director Xu.

420
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:40,640
Come.

421
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:46,560
Sit down.

422
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,920
A tree attracts the wind as the forest is not there to protect it.

423
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,680
We can only stand strong when we form a strong alliance.

424
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,360
Work with me. Cooperate with Xu Corporation.

425
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:03,080
The jade exhibition this time...

426
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,040
...is an opportunity for you to make a name for yourself.

427
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,320
Did you say that I'll become famous?

428
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,600
I'd never thought of that.

429
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,600
After you reach a certain level in doing things,...

430
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,000
...you don't have a choice.

431
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,320
Benefits and danger will come together.

432
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,360
Without good balance, everything will be destroyed...

433
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,560
...in the blink of an eye, or you could even...

434
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:41,200
...be doomed for eternity.

435
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,000
I joined this industry when I was young.

436
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,560
I was arrogant because of my talent and thus,suffered losses.

437
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,280
Luckily,I had people helping me. That's how I survived until today.

438
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,840
I wouldn't want a young and talented man like you...

439
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,640
...to experience the same troubles that I did.

440
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,440
After many years of working, I've seen a lot of things.

441
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,080
Many young men didn't cherish their chances,...

442
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,880
...so they lost their talent just like that.

443
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,600
Xiaozhuang.

444
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,320
You must think about it properly.

445
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,440
Opportunities will not always be there.

446
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:33,000
Not to mention that Xu Jewellery is quite famous in the industry.

447
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,560
If we work together,I guarantee that you'll be the new upstart.

448
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,960
Thank you,Director Xu.

449
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,960
I've heard of Xu Jewellery.

450
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,760
However,I don't have any plans for my future.

451
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,840
I came to this public auction to look around with my friend.

452
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,320
I am a realistic person.

453
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,200
I like to treat others with honesty.

454
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,360
I don't have expectations...

455
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,480
...on fame and fortune.

456
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,040
Happiness comes with contentment.
