1
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:35,500
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,800
Episode 8

3
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,440
He bought a raw stone like this.

4
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,759
There was jade in it...

5
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,759
...but he was too excited...

6
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
...and cut it into pieces. The jade cost RMB8 million...

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,640
...but it was gone like that. -How much was it?

8
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,400
It's RMB8 million?

9
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,600
What a roller coaster ride.

10
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,160
What happened to him after that?

11
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,240
He's fine now.

12
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,080
He even saved on cremation cost...

13
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,760
...as he was buried.

14
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,960
Was it so serious? -He lost everything.

15
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,200
The Ru ware incident wasn't too bad...

16
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,200
...in comparison.

17
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,960
How much do you want to spend today?

18
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,280
RMB5 million? That's great!

19
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,420
I mean RMB5,000. -RMB50 million?

20
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,320
No,I mean RMB5,000 only.

21
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,840
RMB5,000?

22
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,920
If that's the case,you shouldn't have come here.

23
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,440
No,Uncle De said we should...

24
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,540
...watch and listen instead of talking and buying.

25
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,460
Yes,he is right. You may have a look since it's free.

26
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,880
Look at this. This was already appraised.

27
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,120
You can see the blue patterns in it.

28
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,840
It's true. -You're right.

29
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,440
Am I doing it correctly?

30
00:02:59,440 --> 00:02:59,880
Yes.

31
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,760
Don't we have a machine to see...

32
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,440
...the inner part of the stone?

33
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,400
No,we don't have it.

34
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,010
Did you see this?

35
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,240
Indeed!

36
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,660
Can you understand it?

37
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,400
You've brought an expert here. -I'm not an expert.

38
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,320
Why don't you join us?

39
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,810
Since you're lucky,...

40
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,410
...you should have a look downstairs.

41
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,950
He's quite funny.

42
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,640
He's like my friend...

43
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,480
...who was buried.

44
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,400
Ladies and gentlemen,please be seated.

45
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,760
The auction will be starting soon.

46
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,920
Welcome to the auction.

47
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,400
The first item for today is Raw Stone No. 3,...

48
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,730
...which is also our highlight of the day.

49
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,680
It was found in a jadeite mine in Myanmar.

50
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The starting price is RMB4 million.

51
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,940
It must not be less than RMB500,000 for each bid.

52
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,320
It's not expensive.

53
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,370
Let's bid together.

54
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,040
RMB4 million!

55
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,380
RMB4 million is accepted.

56
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,000
Mr. Zhuang offers RMB4 million.

57
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,360
Young man,do you think...

58
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,400
...you can get the stone at the starting price?

59
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,200
Stop pulling the same trick you did at Panjiayuan.

60
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,320
RMB5 million.

61
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,160
RMB5 million is accepted.

62
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,480
RMB5.5 million.

63
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,200
RMB6 million.

64
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,460
RMB6 million is accepted.

65
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,000
Is there anyone else who would like to make a bid?

66
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,440
Xiao Zhao,...

67
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,010
...how's the situation there?

68
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,480
I'll have a look at the exhibition hall.

69
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:05,840
Okay.

70
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,900
I must get the stone today.

71
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,800
Bing Bing has just come back.

72
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,300
I have to give it to her.

73
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,640
RMB7 million.

74
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,370
It is the auction of Raw Stone No. 3.

75
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,610
The highest bid is RMB7 million at the moment.

76
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,120
Mr. Xu has offered RMB7 million.

77
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,980
Does Mr. Zhuang want to make a bid?

78
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,720
RMB8 million.

79
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,080
RMB8 million. -No.

80
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,960
We don't have RMB8 million!

81
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,840
You can't get RMB8 million even if you sell the Yunlong pot!

82
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,720
Although it looks nice from the surface,...

83
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,720
...but no one knows the outcome.

84
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,520
We may lose our money.

85
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,160
It is the auction...

86
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,360
...of Raw Stone No. 3 from Myanmar.

87
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,160
What do you think? -It looks albumen-like...

88
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,640
...with high transparency. It should be a good stone.

89
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,880
As long as the jade is no less than 4cm,...

90
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,610
...we may still make a fortune.

91
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,040
I have no idea anyway. -He who offers RMB8 million...

92
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,360
...was invited by Mr. Gu Tian Feng.

93
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,770
He is Mr. Zhuang Rui.

94
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,800
Mr. Zhuang is new in antiquarian.

95
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,040
He's dabbling in jade industry now.

96
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,240
It seems that Mr. Zhuang is determined to get the jade...

97
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,200
...to make a mark using this half-bid raw stone.

98
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,220
Is there anyone else who would like to make a bid?

99
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,200
RMB8 million,going once.

100
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,730
RMB8 million,going twice.

101
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,280
RMB9 million.

102
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,560
Mr. Xu offers RMB9 million.

103
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,940
RMB9 million is accepted.

104
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,000
Mr. Xu offers RMB9 million.

105
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,720
Do you want to make another bid,Mr. Zhuang?

106
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,960
RMB9 million,going once.

107
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,610
RMB9 million,going twice.

108
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,200
RMB9 million.

109
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,320
Sold.

110
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,880
Congratulations,Xu Jewellery,...

111
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,000
...for getting the stone at RMB9 million.

112
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,530
Congratulations,Mr. Xu Wei. -Bing Bing,...

113
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,580
...although it's expensive,...

114
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,490
...it's just nice as your gift.

115
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,000
It's okay.

116
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,080
You made a great effort to get the stone.

117
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,680
Keep it for yourself.

118
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,560
Xiao Zhao,I found a suspicious target.

119
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,620
Let's go for a drink for celebration.

120
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,360
It's okay.

121
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,440
My heart almost stopped beating just now. If no one continued,...

122
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,500
...the stone.....

123
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,560
Why are you still looking at it?

124
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,760
Are you addicted to it?

125
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,760
This is not good. Those over there are better.

126
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,680
Don't be sad.

127
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,600
We have no money to buy the stone anyway.

128
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,200
This is good.

129
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,600
It's not about the money.

130
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,440
The thing is you have to get a good stone.

131
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,160
This.....

132
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,840
This.....

133
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,960
I want to get this stone.

134
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,360
No,you..... -Let me have a look.

135
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,490
Don't make a decision in haste.

136
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,400
There is jade here...

137
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,960
...but it has too many cracks.

138
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,600
We should just get one from there.

139
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,140
Let's get this. Make the payment.

140
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,080
It costs RMB3,000!

141
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,240
Can I simply take a stone and sell it?

142
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,160
How much is this? -It's RMB3,000.

143
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,200
It's only RMB3,000. You will still have RMB2,000.

144
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,600
Buy me a meal tonight.

145
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,160
This..... I.....

146
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,200
What rubbish is this?

147
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,440
Stop!

148
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,760
Who are you?

149
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,080
Why did you run? -You're chasing after me.

150
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,780
Bring him back.

151
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,880
Mr. Yu,you should have trusted me.

152
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,760
The police came right after you left.

153
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,680
Were you stalking me?

154
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,360
Fine,I'll give you another chance. Where shall we meet?

155
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,220
Are you playing a game?

156
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,540
You should have known that...

157
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,540
...stone gambling is different from antiques.

158
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,800
You won't be as lucky as you were in Panjiayuan.

159
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,360
Who told you that?

160
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,240
Mr. Gu.

161
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,400
Why can't one get lucky in this? -You're right.

162
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,960
There're plenty of chances to get lucky.

163
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,160
It depends on your luck.

164
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,360
Let me have a look.

165
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,960
Xiao Zhuang,it's hard for you...

166
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,930
...to strike gold with this stone.

167
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,570
Without cutting the stone,...

168
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,560
...how can we confirm that it's not a good stone?

169
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,440
You mean you want to cut the stone?

170
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,000
What kind of jade can he get from that stone?

171
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,610
It's the same for everyone.

172
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,360
If there's jade,...

173
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,800
...it would be a miracle.

174
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,160
Don't be so pessimistic.

175
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,020
Didn't you say that some stones look good...

176
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,200
...but there's nothing in them?

177
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,760
However,there may be good jade in those which look bad.

178
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,200
Yes,nothing is impossible in stone gambling.

179
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,240
However,...

180
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,200
...there is no moss on the stone...

181
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,240
...and it has low transparency.

182
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,400
There are cracks on it,too.

183
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,480
It's hard to get good jade out of it.

184
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,290
It's as likely as...

185
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,580
...me having long-pointed teeth and you having horns.

186
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,760
Here you go.

187
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,640
Xiao Zhuang,we'll cut your stone first.

188
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,250
Xiao Zhuang,it's common to lose money in this field.

189
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,850
No worries,I won't lose the money.

190
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,760
We shouldn't be afraid of losing money...

191
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,960
...but we have to learn a lesson from it. What do you think?

192
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:28,800
Yes.

193
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,500
It's going to start. Are you nervous?

194
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,760
It's fun because it's nerve-wracking.

195
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,450
Are you excited?

196
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,280
No,...

197
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,960
...I can't take it.

198
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,360
All right.

199
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,250
You still don't have horns.

200
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,680
If there's no jade after the first cut,that's it.

201
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,780
Grandfather,are you going to continue?

202
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,480
No jade is found from the first cut. Just throw it away.

203
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,720
Mr. Xu,why don't you cut your stone now?

204
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,900
We must be patient. He's not done with his stone yet.

205
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,280
Why don't you give him some encouragement?

206
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,319
It's quite impossible to find jade in here.

207
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,220
Even if there is jade in it,...

208
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:22,960
...it may be at the centre of the stone.

209
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,240
Let's follow the line I draw...

210
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,010
...and cut it open from the middle.

211
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,520
Calm down.

212
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,360
You're so great,Mr. Gu!

213
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,160
Now I have long,pointed teeth.

214
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,600
Do you see my horns?

215
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,560
Mr. Gu,like you've said,...

216
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,280
...it's exciting and nerve-wracking.

217
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,160
Why don't we cut it again based on your third line?

218
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,200
Heed my advice. Stop.

219
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,450
We shouldn't be greedy.

220
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,320
It is worth around RMB100,000.

221
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,120
Stop cutting it. You may lose everything if it's cut wrongly.

222
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,600
Have you made up your mind?

223
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,320
Aren't you going to stop now?

224
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,180
Let's cut it one more time.

225
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,400
Good. You're just like me.

226
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,000
We'll cut it again based on the line I draw.

227
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,120
Okay.

228
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,520
Go.

229
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,680
Go.

230
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,760
Sir,cut the third line.

231
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,720
Mr. Gu,you're great.

232
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,020
You have turned a trash into a gem.

233
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,840
Don't be too excited. There is nothing great about it.

234
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,440
Have a look at mine later.

235
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,920
Mr. Xu,you're very confident.

236
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,440
What if there isn't much jade in it?

237
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,160
Won't you feel embarrassed by then?

238
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,560
You're depending on your luck but I'm depending on my ability.

239
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,480
Have you seen glass types of jade?

240
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,080
You should have a look later.

241
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,000
You're great,Mr. Gu!

242
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:02,840
You're great!

243
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,760
It's a success!

244
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,240
You're so lucky!

245
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,640
You managed to get jade out of a humble-looking stone.

246
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,120
Behind the mist-like crystal is a whole piece...

247
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,360
...of ice-type jade,with a fine shade of green!

248
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,280
Mr. Xu,I don't know much about jade. What do you mean?

249
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,200
I'll offer you RMB8 million. -RMB10 million.

250
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
Go away. Let him enjoy himself.

251
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,560
How can you sell it at only RMB10 million?

252
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,240
I'll offer you RMB18 million,is it okay?

253
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,920
Hold on. All of you are rich.

254
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,280
Let's discuss it.

255
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,640
This way,please. -RMB3,000.

256
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,000
RMB18 million.

257
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:56,720
Mr. Xu,...

258
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,380
...it's your turn now.

259
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,120
RMB18 million is a big amount.

260
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,560
Have a look.

261
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,250
I think it's not the highest price.

262
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,360
Cut it.

263
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,930
You can't increase the price anymore,right?

264
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,840
Let's give in to each other.

265
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,570
This is even better.

266
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,300
Mr. Xu,I'll offer you RMB10 million.

267
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,120
I'll offer you RMB10 million. -Mr. Xu,it's a good price.

268
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,120
You may get a net profit of RMB1 million.

269
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,080
I don't care about RMB1 million.

270
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,360
Cut it again.

271
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,240
He doesn't care about it.

272
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,800
Mr. Xu,let's have a talk.

273
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,200
Have a look.

274
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:41,960
Mr. Xu!

275
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,720
Mr. Xu,I'll offer you RMB20 million.

276
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,280
I'll offer you RMB30 million. Mr. Xu,please sell it to me.

277
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,720
I'll offer you RMB30 million. -He's so lucky.

278
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,640
Mr. Xu,...

279
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,080
...RMB30 million is a good price for a non-ice-type jade.

280
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,940
If I were you,I would have sold it.

281
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,770
How can you compare yourself to me?

282
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,520
Cut it again.

283
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,960
If it is green again,...

284
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,500
...it'll worth more than RMB30 million.

285
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,330
It's such a pity.

286
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,880
There is only an inch of jade.

287
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,640
It's gone.

288
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,690
Are you sure? Let me have a look.

289
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,490
There is only a bit of it.

290
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,120
It's gone!

291
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,280
My friend,no offence.

292
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,160
You should have listened to us.

293
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,760
You would have gotten RMB30 million.

294
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,920
Let me have a look at this RMB30 million stone.

295
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,450
How can it be gone like that?

296
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,880
Keep it properly. -Mr. Xu is different from us.

297
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,000
Yes.

298
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,440
It's only RMB30 million for a game.

299
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,460
You may take it.

300
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,800
He gave it to me...

301
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,700
...but it's even worse than mine.

302
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,000
Okay,I got it.

303
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,960
It's such a pity.

304
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,320
Are you sure it's your first time? You're so lucky.

305
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,120
Yes,it's just dumb luck.

306
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,520
If the stone was sold at the price of RMB6,000,...

307
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,980
...I wouldn't have bought it.

308
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,860
Do you know the reason?

309
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,340
It's because I only had RMB3,000.

310
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,650
You're still counting it. You've counted it for a few times.

311
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,200
Brother Ma,please stop the car.

312
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,440
What's wrong?

313
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,940
I want to count it again at the ATM.

314
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,280
Are you okay?

315
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,400
Brother Ma,let's have a gathering tonight.

316
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,460
I'll buy you a meal.

317
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,120
Sure.

318
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,480
Xiao Rui,...

319
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,100
...we're going to make a fortune.

320
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,400
Since we're getting rich,...

321
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,960
...we should get a car...

322
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,700
...and a new house.

323
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,720
A new house?

324
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,900
Isn't our house still in good condition?

325
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,300
Where are you staying?

326
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,650
We're staying in basement.

327
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,800
Basement?

328
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,100
I think it's spacious.

329
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,560
How big is it?

330
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,610
It's dozens of ping.

331
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,360
That's...

332
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,920
...as big as my bathroom.

333
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,880
How can you live in basement?

334
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,320
I have an empty siheyuan.

335
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,200
You may stay there.

336
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,880
It's inappropriate,right?

337
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,560
No,it isn't.

338
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,880
Brother Ma,we're rich. We won't take advantage of you.

339
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,040
We'll pay you the rental.

340
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,200
We're fair.

341
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,640
Is it so bad to live in the basement?

342
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,560
Zhuang Rui,I was busy just now. I didn't hear the call.

343
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,600
What's wrong?

344
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,740
It doesn't matter. I wanted to buy you a meal.

345
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,880
Why don't we go for supper?

346
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,600
Sure.

347
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,400
Why are you alone? Where is your boss?

348
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,210
Our boss has something on today. He can't make it.

349
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,680
He can't make it?

350
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,120
Is it because he is guilty?

351
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,080
You all are more cunning than us.

352
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,760
We risked our lives for you...

353
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,880
...but you couldn't care less about our lives.

354
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,920
You're not loyal at all.

355
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,680
Mr. Yu,don't be angry.

356
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,680
What about your loyalty?

357
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,880
You're paid to work for us.

358
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,400
You're clear that...

359
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,120
...you have nothing.

360
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,040
You didn't get the jade at the pawn shop.

361
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:07,320
There's no jade at the tomb of Duke Huan of Qi either.

362
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,120
Even so,...

363
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,640
...we still pay you.

364
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,120
This is our loyalty.

365
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,800
Have a look...

366
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,010
...at the money.

367
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,120
You're sensible.

368
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,520
Tell your boss that it is right for her to pay us.

369
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,120
It is compensation for our emotional distress.

370
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,880
Let me give you a formal notice.

371
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,120
Unhealthy food like instant noodles...

372
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:00,960
...should disappear from our world starting today.

373
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,400
What are you doing? Let's go.

374
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,730
Is this your father?

375
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,960
It's my grandfather.

376
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,160
I was told about the stories of my grandfather since young...

377
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,050
...but I have never met him.

378
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,360
Before I slept,my father would read...

379
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,770
...one of my grandfather's books.

380
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,140
Was it Grimm's Fairy Tales...

381
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,240
...or Monkey King and the White Bone Demon?

382
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,700
It's The Geology of China.

383
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,120
He studied geology while you studied history.

384
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,360
Both subjects are boring.

385
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,480
Are these left behind by your grandfather?

386
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,960
Let's bring them with us.

387
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,200
I'm not sure whether he left these behind...

388
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,200
...as my father said my grandfather was still alive.

389
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:11,520
We displayed all the photos of my grandfather's...

390
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,900
...geological exploration at home.

391
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,040
My father said my grandfather was adventurous...

392
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,640
...and wouldn't die easily.

393
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,440
He just changed his name and moved to somewhere...

394
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,040
...to have a different life.

395
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,360
I also believe that heroes live on.

396
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,620
Heroes live on!

397
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,330
Hurry up!

398
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,640
Are you free this weekend? There is a jade seminar.

399
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,120
Are you interested? -Thank you,Mr. Gu.

400
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,170
You're welcome.

401
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,080
Qiming and I got these stones...

402
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,010
...from our first stone gambling.

403
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,320
We almost lost all our money.

404
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,560
We cut the stone into two...

405
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,180
...and made a pair of pendants to remind ourselves that...

406
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,240
...we shouldn't think of getting rich overnight...

407
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,500
...and that we should be down-to-earth.

408
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,170
I didn't expect that...

409
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,890
...after so many years,...

410
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,280
...Qiming is gone...

411
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,010
...but I'm able to see the pendants again.

412
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,560
I didn't expect you to be Qiming's grandson.

413
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,200
Were you close to my grandfather?

414
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,520
We were best friends.

415
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,720
He went to Gansu for an excursion...

416
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,080
...but he didn't come back.

417
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,640
An excursion? Did he contact you?

418
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,720
What happened after that?

419
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:30,920
Hold on.

420
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,320
I was supposed to go for the excursion...

421
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,160
...but I hurt my leg.

422
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,280
So he went on my behalf.

423
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,170
I promised to buy him drinks when he came back.

424
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,690
I didn't expect that...

425
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,890
...he would be gone.

426
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,740
We kept in touch through letters after he went to Gansu.

427
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,330
I got to know his news through the letters.

428
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,360
I didn't understand...

429
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,880
...why my father always said that...

430
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,600
...my grandfather would be back.

431
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,440
He said by the time he's back,...

432
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,620
...the three of us would go for an archaeological trip.

433
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,200
However,there has been no news...

434
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,780
...throughout the years.

435
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,240
Qiming is gone,but I'm still alive.

436
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,960
I can bring you around for archaeological trips,too.

437
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,160
After losing touch with him,I'd been looking for your family...

438
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,200
...but all of you had moved away.

439
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,120
It's good to see you today.

440
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,000
If not,I wouldn't rest easy for the rest of my life.

441
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,480
Grandfather!

442
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,850
Xiao Rui,you're here,too.

443
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:25,120
Xiao Yu,Zhuang Rui will be your brother from today onwards.

444
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,080
What's wrong? Qiming and I were very close.

445
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,280
I'll treat his grandson like my own.

446
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,160
Have a seat.

447
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,360
I'll be your god-grandfather,okay?

448
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,240
Good! Call me grandfather.

449
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,680
Grandfather.

450
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,120
That's the way!

451
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,040
Xiao Yu,call him brother.

452
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,480
Are you serious,grandfather?

453
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,880
I'm older than Xiao Rui.

454
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,340
Stop talking nonsense! Is it important?

455
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:21,800
Both of you are my grandsons anyway. Are you going to call him?

456
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,760
Since we're all here today,...

457
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,210
...let's have a drink to celebrate it.

458
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,640
I would like to...

459
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,840
...go back and read my grandfather's letters.
