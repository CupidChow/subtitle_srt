00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,800
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Episode 47

3
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,440
Grandfather,...

4
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,720
...and the archaeological team...

5
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,020
...that sacrificed their lives.

6
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,580
This is your badges...

7
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,000
...found in the tomb.

8
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,120
We brought them out.

9
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,240
Today,...

10
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,400
...I'm going to...

11
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,890
...bury them under this monument.

12
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,880
Thank you for your contribution...

13
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,220
...towards China's archaeological industry.

14
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,040
Thank you.

15
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,680
That.....

16
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,440
This.....

17
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,840
8th October,1974.

18
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,520
We entered the tomb today.

19
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,040
This is the pattern of an eye.

20
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,440
Why carve an eye on a jade?

21
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,920
It looks like a totem.

22
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,120
Is there a record of totem...

23
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,040
...in Chinese history?

24
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,680
I don't think so. -Does this mean...

25
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,450
...that our research found a huge discovery?

26
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,120
Extreme darkness will be the light.

27
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,880
What does this mean? -I don't know.

28
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,920
Perhaps it's connected to the tomb master.

29
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,560
Mr. Zhuang,the generator's ready. Let's switch on the lights.

30
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,960
Okay. I'll help you.

31
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,120
Here.

32
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,280
Xiaoma!

33
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,120
Quick!

34
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,540
Xiaoma,are you all right?

35
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,600
Xiaoli? Bo Wen?

36
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,840
Bo Wen!

37
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,400
Xiaoli. Xiaoli!

38
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,440
Nakagawa.

39
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:34,150
Nakagawa,are you all right?

40
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,440
Qiming,help.....

41
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,360
Help me. -I'll help you out of here.

42
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,240
I'll get you out of here. Trust me,Nakagawa!

43
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,680
Hang in there,Nakagawa!

44
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,480
Thank you.

45
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,320
Mr. Zhuang.

46
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,840
The ghosts trapped us.

47
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,160
We'll never get out!

48
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,480
Xiaoma! There's no such things as ghosts.

49
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,960
I'll get you out of here. Trust me!

50
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,640
Xiaoma

51
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
I'm almost there.

52
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,000
Xiaoma,give me a hand.

53
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,000
Continue!

54
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,360
Mr. Zhuang,we need to leave.

55
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,000
This sand will bury us.

56
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,640
His body is hot. Mr. Zhuang, he'll die like this!

57
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,160
Xiaoma,do you know if there's a village?

58
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,650
He needs to see a doctor.

59
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,480
Mr. Zhuang,there's a village over there.

60
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,760
Let's go there! -Help me get him up.

61
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,920
Mr. Zhuang!

62
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,880
Put me down.

63
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,560
This village is empty.

64
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,280
We always experience drought here.

65
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,720
If there's no water, an entire village will move away.

66
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,200
With no water, he can't take any medicine.

67
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,680
It's all right. Keep finding, we'll find a village.

68
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,480
Yes,no matter what,we need to find somewhere to rest.

69
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,920
Okay. -Let's go.

70
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,000
Mr. Zhuang.

71
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,560
After Nakagawa wakes up, we need to get moving.

72
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,280
There's no water here. We can't stay long.

73
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,440
Nakagawa.

74
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,200
How do you feel? Better?

75
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,400
There might be water here. -There's water?

76
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,560
There's water inside here. -There's water?

77
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,560
Yes. -How did you know?

78
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,120
I can see it.

79
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,040
You can see it? -Yes.

80
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,800
Xiaoma,hold him.

81
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,160
Gently.

82
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,460
Hand me the shovel.

83
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:11,640
Xiaoma,there really is water. -There's water!

84
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,310
Yes! Here.

85
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:27,200
How is it? Any changes?

86
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,640
I can't tell...

87
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,020
...but I'm not a doctor so I can't be too sure.

88
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,020
When we return to Beijing, we'll go to the hospital.

89
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,360
Nakagawa.

90
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,720
What is it? -Brother Qiming.

91
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,440
There's something...

92
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,020
...underneath the firewood.

93
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,200
Nakagawa,look. There's something. -It must be gold pieces.

94
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,880
Are they gold pieces?

95
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,960
24th October,1974.

96
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,890
Nakagawa was injured in an explosion.

97
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,160
He's almost recovered. While he's recovering,...

98
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,920
...I found abandoned stones in the village...

99
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,250
...and erected a monument.

100
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,200
It's a memorial for our colleagues who sacrificed their lives.

101
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,880
Perhaps he strained his eyes,...

102
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,120
...as long as Nakagawa use his super eyes for too long,...

103
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,420
...he would temporarily lose sight or hearing.

104
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,360
We've decided to not use his eyes power...

105
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,880
...before we return to Beijing.

106
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,360
The only problem is, Xiaoma is acting strange.

107
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,680
He keeps staring at Nakagawa's eyes.

108
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,240
He makes Nakagawa look at things everyday.

109
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,600
I mentioned this to him and he threw things in a rage.

110
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,720
Perhaps he's jealous of Nakagawa's eyes.

111
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,080
However,I hope he doesn't cross the line.

112
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,560
What do you want? -Give your eyes to me.

113
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,040
What? -I said give your eyes to me.

114
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,280
Hurry. I'll count to 3.

115
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,280
If you don't give it to me, I'll kill you!

116
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,930
Xiaoma,listen. It's not like what you think.

117
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,440
Nakagawa,let's go!

118
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,960
Hang in there.

119
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,640
Nakagawa,how are you doing?

120
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,440
I'm all right.

121
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,720
Come out! You're not coming out?

122
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,240
Fine,I'll wait!

123
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,240
I have the time but you don't!

124
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,840
Come out! -What do we do?

125
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,120
Don't worry. It's all right.

126
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,520
It's all right. -Nakagawa!

127
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,440
Mr. Nakagawa, your eyes are incredible.

128
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,880
Why weren't your eyes incredible before you entered the tomb?

129
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,640
Mr. Nakagawa! Where are you?

130
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,880
You must've stolen treasure from the tomb,right?

131
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,520
I didn't steal anything. -I know you didn't.

132
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,280
Where are you? Aren't you coming out?

133
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,520
If you don't give me your eyes today,...

134
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,800
...I'll get rid of you!

135
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,960
Come out!

136
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,440
Come out,Mr. Zhuang!

137
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,960
Mr. Nakagawa! -What do we do?

138
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,080
Come out!

139
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,480
Listen,I'll go out and distract him.

140
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,000
You must run away. -No,it's too dangerous.

141
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,520
It's okay. It's you he wants,not me.

142
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,240
As long as you're safe, I can escape.

143
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,720
But..... -No.

144
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,080
If we stay on like this, we'll both die.

145
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,890
Nakagawa,listen to me.

146
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,800
When you escape,follow the direction of Venus.

147
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,160
Go East and you'll find a village.

148
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,800
Get help from the government. They'll help you.

149
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,560
What about you? -Don't worry about me.

150
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,360
I'll find you.

151
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,600
Mr. Nakagawa!

152
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,560
Where are you? -Stay safe.

153
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,770
Don't worry. -Come out!

154
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,000
I'll have the eyes anyway.

155
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,720
Come out!

156
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:38,120
Where are you? Come out!

157
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,720
Don't shoot!

158
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,170
Don't shoot.

159
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,280
It's no use killing Nakagawa.

160
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,280
The secret isn't in his eyes.

161
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,840
It's in this notebook.

162
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,400
What's the secret? Tell me!

163
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,000
Xiaoma,you're young. Don't do anything stupid.

164
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,640
Don't make another step!

165
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,600
Tell me!

166
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,600
Even if you kill Nakagawa...

167
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,330
...and dig his eyes out, you won't have the power.

168
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,840
You want Nakagawa's eyes and his powers.

169
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,970
You want it easy without working hard!

170
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,640
If you want the secret, put your gun down.

171
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,960
I'll tell you.

172
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,320
Yes,put your gun down.

173
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,960
Xiaoma got me.

174
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,800
He won't let me go this time.

175
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,280
This notebook can't fall into the hands of Xiaoma.

176
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,920
That's all.

177
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,880
Grandfather Zhuang gave us 2 important clues.

178
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,400
Firstly,it's Xiaoma.

179
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,490
Besides Grandfather Zhuang and Nakagawa's father,...

180
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,700
...he's the first to know about the Golden Eyes.

181
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,840
He's eyeing the Golden Eyes.

182
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,640
Based on your grandfather's description,Xiaoma was no more...

183
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:41,160
...than 20 years old .If he's still alive,...

184
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,280
...he should be around 60 years old.

185
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,520
Secondly,...

186
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,810
...there are 4 pieces to this jade.

187
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,960
The first one was broken in Feng Quan's tomb.

188
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,160
It hit Nakagawa Yohei.

189
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,600
The second one was broken in the pawn shop...

190
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,860
...and hit Zhuang Rui.

191
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,720
The third one.

192
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,180
As of right now,...

193
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,400
...it's with Nakagawa Ryosuke.

194
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,920
The fourth one is still missing.

195
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,360
Right now, we need to do 2 things.

196
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,880
Firstly,look for Xiaoma.

197
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,280
Secondly,look for the final piece of jade.

198
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,200
Are you all right?

199
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,410
The Golden Eyes isn't a good thing.

200
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,120
It brings out darkness from one's heart.

201
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,680
Just like Xiaoma.

202
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,840
Before he entered the tomb,...

203
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,770
...grandfather said he's a curious and a good child.

204
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,760
If only grandfather can tell me...

205
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,380
...how to return to my life without the Golden Eyes.

206
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,500
Feifei,I've prepared the sleeping bag for you.

207
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,240
We found the Guardian's Monument and Grandfather's notebook.

208
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,600
We'll return to the inn tomorrow.

209
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,200
You and I will take turns keeping guard.

210
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:41,680
Okay.

211
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,480
Miss Xiaojia.

212
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,440
It's all well.

213
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,240
Xiaoyun,is there anything on your mind?

214
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,560
You can even hear it through the phone?

215
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,400
I have you on my mind.

216
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,360
Why do I feel like you have something on your mind?

217
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,280
Don't worry. We'll be back in 2 days.

218
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,560
Really? -Really.

219
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,880
I'll go to sleep now. It's been a long day.

220
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,000
A kiss for you. -Bye.

221
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,720
The extreme darkness...

222
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,000
...will be the light.

223
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,520
What will be the light?

224
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,720
The extreme darkness will be the light.

225
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,800
What's wrong?

226
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,620
Are you all right? -Zhuang Rui,are you okay?

227
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,960
No,something's wrong with this place.

228
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,880
What's wrong? -I can't use the Golden Eyes.

229
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,620
You're saying that...

230
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,120
...Feng Quan designed the Bagua door...

231
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,280
...so people with the Golden Eyes can't use it.

232
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,840
Grandfather.

233
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,300
I know what "The extreme darkness will be the light" means.

234
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,440
Xiaorui,get up. We're leaving.

235
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,000
Xiaorui! Where is he

236
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,680
I know the Golden Eyes's secret. I'll be at Feng Quan's tomb.

237
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:49,400
Are you crazy? Peng Fei! Feifei! Xiaorui went to Feng Quan's tomb!

238
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,720
Xuanbing.

239
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,200
I'm here to say goodbye.

240
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,080
I'm going back in a few days.

241
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,920
Didn't you want the secret of the Golden Eye?

242
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:51,600
That day,on the sarcophagus in the tomb,these were carved,...

243
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,520
...the extreme darkness will be the light.

244
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,080
It means that darkness is also light.

245
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,520
The Bagua Door mechanism designed by Feng Quan...

246
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,050
...makes the Golden Eyes useless.

247
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,520
At the time,I thought...

248
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:15,500
...if grandfather can use wits and courage to brave it,...

249
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,630
...I can,too.

250
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,190
When I truly...

251
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,699
...became a normal person...

252
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,150
...and braved it with the rest,I realized...

253
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,929
...what Feng Quan wanted to tell me all along.

254
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,360
To get away from illnesses that come with the Golden Eyes,...

255
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:38,150
...one must give up the shortcuts that come with it...

256
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,920
...because...

257
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,170
...there are no shortcuts in life.

258
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,040
Only by accepting and facing darkness...

259
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,840
...can one regain vision.

260
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,000
The wall paintings have been destroyed...

261
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,600
...and I don't know what Feng Quan has drawn...

262
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,050
...but I believe...

263
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,810
...that Feng Quan must've return to darkness...

264
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,800
...before he regained his vision...

265
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,360
...and died a peaceful death.

266
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,600
The solution to the problem is the problem itself.

267
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,680
It's simpler than we think,right?

268
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,040
If it were you or Qin Haoran,...

269
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,200
...would've you have given up this shortcut easily?

270
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,560
There's no point asking this now.

271
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,840
May you rest in peace.

272
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,000
I've decided to return to darkness.

273
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,160
I'll give up the Golden Eyes.

274
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,520
Too many people gave up their conscience and principle...

275
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,120
...for the Golden Eyes.

276
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,360
Yes.

277
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,840
The Golden Eyes indeed brings...

278
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:18,000
...money and fame.

279
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,520
However,it also brings out...

280
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,720
...one's deepest and darkest desires.

281
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,680
Thank you all for being with me.

282
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:36,840
Thank you. I..... -What?

283
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,960
You always said you're just like us,right?

284
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,320
Why make it sound like a will? -Exactly.

285
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:48,120
Don't worry. I've been reading medical books.

286
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,840
You'll be cured.

287
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,800
With your skill, don't create trouble.

288
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,400
I studied medicine overseas,all right?

289
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,880
What do you mean with my skill? -You studied overseas...

290
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,210
...but you keep inviting me to play games.

291
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,800
Why did you expose me?

292
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,280
Listen,don't expose me when we return to Beijing.

293
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,160
Do you hear me? To Miss Xiaojia,...

294
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,480
...I'm an awesome man.

295
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,080
Please help me this time. Don't leave me like this.

296
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,640
Thanks to your ancestor's jade,...

297
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,930
...we finally found Feng Quan's tomb.

298
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,440
However,there was an explosion back then.

299
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,680
The place is a mess.

300
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,080
The tomb has been buried now.

301
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,320
I hope Feng Quan can rest in peace...

302
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,460
...without being disturbed.

303
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,760
Did you find what you were looking for?

304
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,360
We found it...

305
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,840
...but the price paid is too high.

306
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,120
Mr. Feng, what's your plan after this?

307
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,120
I'll let my hand recover.

308
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,600
I won't create fake antiques anymore.

309
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:24,160
However,besides making ceramics, I have no other skills.

310
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,920
Mr. Feng, have you thought about...

311
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,080
...designing your own ceramics?

312
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,640
Create artwork according to current trend.

313
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,960
The Tang Dynasty Sancai you made...

314
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,880
...is flawless but it lacks vicissitude.

315
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,640
A fake is still fake.

316
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,400
You can use ancient clay...

317
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,600
...and materials but...

318
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,970
...you can't replicate the humanity and society back then.

319
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,000
Trying to replicate these differences...

320
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,920
...isn't something man can do. -Yes.

321
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,120
Instead of imitating our predecessor,...

322
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,120
...why don't you create your own designs?

323
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,880
I like antiques but I also like...

324
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,000
...art that has yet to become an antique.

325
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,400
Your craftsmanship is as good as those in the past.
