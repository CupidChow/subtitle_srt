00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,000
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 31

3
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,400
I've been looking for a chance to apologize about Myanmar.

4
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,370
No need for that.

5
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,840
It's all because I believe too much in.....

6
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,120
Anyway,...

7
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,960
...you were injured because of me. I'm sorry.

8
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,620
There's no need to apologize.

9
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,400
Thank you.

10
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,980
Why are you thanking me again?

11
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Thank you for taking care of me.

12
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:24,720
Thank you.

13
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,280
I've been drinking so my thoughts are muddled.

14
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,600
I hope you don't mind.

15
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,120
I don't mind but...

16
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,840
...I have yet to forgive you.

17
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,570
Well,tell me then. What will make you forgive me?

18
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,160
How about a song?

19
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,280
Okay. What about a rock song? -Sure.

20
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,280
However,a rock song doesn't seem to fit this ambiance.

21
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,560
What about a lullaby?

22
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,920
You like lullabies?

23
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,120
My grandmother's or my grandfather's?

24
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,640
Your grandmother's.

25
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,700
My grandmother used to sing this to me when I was little.

26
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,820
The title of the lullaby is...

27
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,260
...Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.

28
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,560
Twinkle twinkle little star,...

29
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,000
...how I wonder what you are.

30
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,600
Up above the world so high,.....

31
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,520
I like it! -I'm surprised you know the song.

32
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,020
You are forgiven. -You are as old as my grandmother.

33
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,240
You are,not me.

34
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,400
Xiaohu,tell Xiaoliu to look for me in a while.

35
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,180
Professor,...

36
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,520
...the main tomb entrance has been opened.

37
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,740
The main tomb should be behind the huge boulder.

38
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,960
Prepare the equipments to salvage any treasures.

39
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,960
Yes,professor. -Get Zhuang Rui and Feifei.

40
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,680
Okay.

41
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,240
Are you all right? Do you feel stuffy again?

42
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,330
Can you go on?

43
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,600
Let's go.

44
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,320
This coffin is in good condition. It hasn't been raided.

45
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,580
We're lucky this time.

46
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,240
Xiaoren,make preparations to open up the coffin.

47
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,360
Yes,professor. -Xiaohu and Xiali.

48
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,840
Clean up the area. -Yes.

49
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,600
There is mercury inside.

50
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:00,980
Zhuang Rui.

51
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,380
Zhuang Rui.

52
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,920
What's wrong,Zhuang Rui? -What is it?

53
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,250
What is it,Zhuang Rui? -What's wrong?

54
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,800
He has been acting odd since we came down here.

55
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,240
Professor Meng, why don't I take him back up?

56
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,040
I think it's for the best. We'll handle it here.

57
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,800
Please take care of him. -Don't worry.

58
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,260
Take it slow. -Be careful.

59
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,180
Be careful,Xiaorui. -Watch your steps.

60
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,610
Take it slow.

61
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,720
You're up.

62
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,700
Why are we out here?

63
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,290
Don't you remember?

64
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,000
You fainted in the tombs but a doctor has seen you.

65
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,130
You're all right. It was only hypoxia.

66
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,120
Hypoxia?

67
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,320
Yes,we're on high altitude grassland.

68
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,240
What you had was altitude sickness.

69
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,040
You won a wrestling match with such a weak body.

70
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,650
From now on,you must join me on my morning run.

71
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,080
What are you looking for?

72
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,160
What's wrong?

73
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,520
Where's my notebook?

74
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,200
Is everything ready? -Yes.

75
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,280
Okay. -Is everything all right?

76
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,680
Professor,we're ready. Let's open up the coffin.

77
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,360
What is this? -Zhuang Rui's structural drawing.

78
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,660
There's another level below?

79
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,080
How did he know?

80
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,250
I'm not sure about that.

81
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,400
Could this be dangerous? It's hard to tell.

82
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,840
Judging from the material and structure of the tomb,...

83
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,040
...there could be another level below.

84
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,600
Let us open this up then.

85
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,610
All right. Hold this for me.

86
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,400
All of you,move aside. Prepare to open the coffin.

87
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,610
Professor Meng.

88
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,060
Speak to me.

89
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,040
There is mercury in the coffin. Open it with care.

90
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,220
You must wear a gas mask when opening the coffin.

91
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,800
This can't do. I must go down. -No,you can't do that.

92
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,340
The doctor said that you need to rest.

93
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,720
It wasn't hypoxia, there was poisonous gas.

94
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,880
I need to help them. If I don't,...

95
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,840
...they might not be wearing face masks...

96
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,700
...and put their lives in danger.

97
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,180
Xiaohu,activate the air quality controller and keep it running.

98
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:17,880
All right.

99
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,020
Zhuang Rui,why are you here instead of resting?

100
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,840
Come,give them the gas masks.

101
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,480
Thank you.

102
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,620
Have a look.

103
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,530
People of the past did use mercury to seal up coffins.

104
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,520
Large amount of mercury will evaporate when exposed to heat.

105
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,680
This area is sealed so we'll be prone to mercury poisoning.

106
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,530
Zhuang Rui,how did you know that the tomb has another level?

107
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,000
Ba Te'er mentioned that grass doesn't on this tract of land.

108
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,320
I suspected the underground water shifted downwards...

109
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,380
...and couldn't reach the land due to toxic materials.

110
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,690
However,I couldn't ascertain the toxic materials.

111
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,240
I hadn't expected it to be mercury.

112
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,640
Xiaoli,bring the suction machine. -No.

113
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,120
The suction machine will damage the coffin and everything inside.

114
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,160
Professor,what do we do?

115
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,480
We can only tools to scoop all the mercury out.

116
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,680
Only then will we open the tomb.

117
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,280
Zhuang Rui. -Zhuang Rui.

118
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,960
What's wrong? -Zhuang Rui.

119
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,320
What's with you? Are you all right?

120
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,000
My ears. -Professor Meng,...

121
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,480
...I will take him up there.

122
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,640
All right. -I'll go with you.

123
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,000
Take it slow. -You don't have to come with us.

124
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,600
Take it slow. -Be careful.

125
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,000
Come,let us scoop out all the mercury.

126
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,840
All right.

127
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I can't take this anymore. -Doctor!

128
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,480
What happened to him?

129
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,740
Come,bring him in.

130
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,840
I can't see anything. -Hold him tight.

131
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,600
Okay. -I can't hear anything.

132
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,460
Zhuang Rui,relax.

133
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,960
Doctor,will he be fine?

134
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,840
You must hold him tight while I inject him.

135
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,320
Okay.

136
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,960
Let me do it.

137
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,720
Relax. -Hold him tight.

138
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,680
Relax.

139
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,359
Hang in there.

140
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,330
He's shaking uncontrollably.

141
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,160
Did he receive any kind of shock?

142
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,960
I'm not sure...

143
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,970
...but I don't think so.

144
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,930
Has he fainted before this?

145
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,860
Our equipments are insufficient and these are all we have.

146
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,280
He needs to be checked in a hospital in Beijing.

147
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,120
Doctor,what do we do now?

148
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,320
I've stabilised his condition.

149
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,570
However,there's not much equipment so it'll be difficult.

150
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,280
Well,could you tell me where I can get some medicine?

151
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:16,880
I'll write a prescription. You can go to a nearby farm.

152
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,880
They should have some. -Okay.

153
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,520
Put the covers on him.

154
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,320
Feifei!

155
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,760
Where are you going? -I'm going to the farm.

156
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,200
I'll come with you. -No need. I know the way.

157
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,010
The target is approaching you.

158
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,880
Both of you,listen up. Kill her.

159
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,840
Friend,may I help you?

160
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,680
Friend,where are you from and where are you heading to?

161
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,960
I'm from Wuqi Mountain and I'm heading to the farm.

162
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,600
However,I seem to be lost. How do I get to the farm?

163
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,400
If that's the case,...

164
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,920
...you will reach the farm if you go straight ahead.

165
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,280
Thank you.

166
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,410
Wait!

167
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,020
Friend,this place isn't safe. Wild wolves often appears.

168
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,720
What about I show you the way? -No,it's okay.

169
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,840
Goodbye.

170
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,020
Are you all right? -I'm all right.

171
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,170
How did you get here?

172
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,880
I saw a car on the highlands near the tomb.

173
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,080
It doesn't belong to the archaeological team.

174
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,480
No one knows this place except for me.

175
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,120
They must be after us.

176
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,530
What happened to your hand?

177
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,640
I'm all right.

178
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,010
Who are they?

179
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,700
Just a group of hooligans.

180
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,040
Hooligans?

181
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,600
You're not an assistant,are you?

182
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,610
Could you do me a favour?

183
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,680
Watch them for me. I'm getting help at the farm.

184
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,930
You're injured so I'll go instead.

185
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,000
I'm fine. I'll leave this to you.

186
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,010
It wasn't a mistake liking you.

187
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,220
She's just my type.

188
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,040
Gently. In one,two,three!

189
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:10,800
What.....

190
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,460
Why is there no corpse?

191
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,400
Put it aside for now.

192
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,480
We'll carry out a thorough research when we're done.

193
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,440
Okay.

194
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,480
Be gentle.

195
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,080
Here,take it. -Hold your hands out.

196
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,420
Doctor,is he feeling better?

197
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,560
He's much better.

198
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,580
I got the medicine.

199
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,930
What happened to your hand?

200
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,200
It's nothing. -How can this be nothing.

201
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,930
I'll clean your wounds.

202
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,640
Be careful.

203
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,080
Is he your boyfriend?

204
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,720
You treat him well.

205
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,680
You must watch over him. -Thank you,doctor.

206
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,680
Don't mention it.

207
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,380
Thank you for your help this time.

208
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,560
It's nothing. -Thank you.

209
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,280
What do you say? Let's set things straight.

210
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,770
Do you like me or not?

211
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,100
You're such a.....

212
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,640
Well.....

213
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:22,960
Feifei.

214
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,040
Xiaoyu,are you here for me?

215
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,240
I'm here for Xiaorui. How is he doing?

216
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,170
He fell ill when we were in the tomb.

217
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,440
I'll take you to him. -Is it that bad?

218
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,120
Come. -Let's go.

219
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,920
Brother Ba Te'er,I..... -Brother Ba Te'er,...

220
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,520
...have an early rest today.

221
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,480
Miao Feifei,that was such terrible acting.

222
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,160
What acting?

223
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,880
You used me as a cover.

224
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,220
Did you think I wouldn't know?

225
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,720
Speaking about this,...

226
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,200
...the strongman outside is not bad.

227
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,200
He likes you and makes no attempt to hide his feelings.

228
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,930
I admire that about him.

229
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,480
If you keep things to yourself,...

230
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,410
...it will be hard on yourself.

231
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,660
Feifei,...

232
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,650
...I feel like your relationship with Zhuang Rui...

233
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,410
...has changed.

234
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,680
Don't make wild guesses.

235
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,720
I could tell from the way you brought him up here...

236
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,130
...that you truly care for him.

237
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,340
If he dares disobeys me...

238
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,420
...and come up slightly later, he'd be dead.

239
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,800
There are so many different types of jade...

240
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,130
...from different eras and places of origin.

241
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,240
What more,they are all valued differently.

242
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,640
I wonder how Zhuang Rui could tell one from another.

243
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,700
You don't want any?

244
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,170
The phone has been ringing non-stop. Didn't you hear it?

245
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,900
I was busy studying and didn't hear the call.

246
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,200
Pengfei,it's your fault. All you do is eat.

247
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,600
You made Jiajia angry.

248
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,320
Feifei is on the phone.

249
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,640
Have a seat.

250
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,440
Eat up.

251
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,120
Here's your drinks. -Answer the call.

252
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,720
Eat up.

253
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:27,600
Officer Feifei, to what do I owe this honour?

254
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,720
You must be enjoying mutton from the grassland and organic milk.

255
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,600
I'm surprised you still think about your miserable friends.

256
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,490
Something has happened to Zhuang Rui.

257
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,120
What happened to him?

258
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,080
He hasn't been feeling well since he came here.

259
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,940
Does he have any illness before this?

260
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,200
Illness? He neither smokes nor drink. What illness?

261
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,440
He has no illness.

262
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,360
The thing is,he fainted when we were in the tomb...

263
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,840
...and his eyes were uncomfortable and his ears were ringing.

264
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,680
What? Don't exaggerate.

265
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:07,960
Is it serious?

266
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,500
Why don't Pengfei and I go over there?

267
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,000
No need,he's all right now.

268
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,260
Once his condition is stable, I'll send him to Beijing.

269
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,760
Sure. Call me anytime.

270
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,200
Okay,bye.

271
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,820
What is it? What happened?

272
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,320
Zhuang Rui fell ill and fainted. -Thank you.

273
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,880
It's like in Myanmar. -This time must be serious.

274
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,580
Why does Zhuang Rui keep making us worry?

275
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,800
Anyway,Feifei is there so it should be fine.

276
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,480
Should we go to Inner Mongolia? -No.

277
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,400
We'll wait for him to wake up. Come,eat up.

278
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,680
Professor,the maintenance and transport team has arrived.

279
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,560
Okay,we'll finish up today. -All right.

280
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,400
This is the excavation site.

281
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,060
They're surveying the site. -That's quick.

282
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,220
They're already surveying the site.

283
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,340
This doesn't seem special at all.

284
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,930
It's different from what I had in mind.

285
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,570
It has lost its mystery, hasn't it?

286
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,440
I thought that archaeologists are like explorers...

287
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,200
...who can penetrate the earth and the sky. Doesn't look like it.

288
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,810
This is what we face daily as archaeologists.

289
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,640
We excavate the area to collect the treasures underneath...

290
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,640
...for purpose of research.

291
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,600
You must survey it well, all right?

292
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,000
Professor,this is the list of the first batch of relics.

293
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,460
Please have a look. -Okay.

294
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,860
Feifei,you can take Ba Te'er around.

295
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,840
Okay. -Please have a look.

296
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:40,930
Let's go.

297
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,360
I've listed them out.

298
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,290
When we went into the tomb earlier,...

299
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,850
...we couldn't find anything similar to the jade figurine.

300
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,040
I can't believe that after excavating this area,...

301
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,970
...we still didn't find anything.

302
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,160
It's strange.

303
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,800
Are we moving into the wrong direction?

304
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,600
Perhaps this tomb...

305
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,040
...is not the one we're looking for.

306
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,400
There is one thing that is related to the jade figurine.

307
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,480
What is it? -The jade chess.

308
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,440
You're right!

309
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:20,880
There isn't the body of the tomb master...

310
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,040
...in the mercury-sealed tomb...

311
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,920
...but we did find a jade chess.

312
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,000
The jade chess looks similar to the jade figurine.

313
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,480
I think they are related.

314
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,800
Xiaoren,any clues about the identity of the tomb master?

315
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,520
The relics that we dug out this time is similar to...

316
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,960
...Qi Heng's tomb in Gansu.

317
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,760
The relics are from different eras...

318
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,480
...however Qi Heng's interests and his past life...

319
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,670
...were inscribed on the tomb.

320
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,640
This tomb has no inscription whatsoever.

321
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,000
Professor Meng,is this common?

322
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,360
I've never seen a tomb like this. It's strange.

323
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,960
Let us have a closer look. -Okay.

324
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,040
Professor,take it slow.

325
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,240
Do go slow.

326
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:16,920
Come.

327
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,640
Professor,I think we are moving in the wrong direction.

328
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,560
We've wasted so much time and resources...

329
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,520
...just to find out the origin of a jade figurine.

330
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,850
This isn't worth doing.

331
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,760
Tell me,what is worth doing?

332
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,920
If we,as archaeologists, are not willing to do this...

333
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,720
...and set things straight,...

334
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,280
...how many more national relics would be raided?

335
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,250
I know where you're coming from but...

336
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,440
...either it's locating metal or the excavation,...

337
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,280
...we still have yet to obtain new results.

338
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,600
Xiaogu.

339
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,560
What is your view on this?

340
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,480
I believe that the jade chess and the jade figurine...

341
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,560
...are highly likely...

342
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,240
...from the same tomb.

343
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,760
However, Professor Ren has a point.

344
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,160
It could also be a mere coincidence.

345
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,760
A coffin without a body and just a jade chess.

346
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,720
What could it mean?

347
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,220
Professor,...

348
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,040
...may I have a few minutes with you?

349
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,400
Both of you may leave. I'll think about it.

350
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,480
Okay.

351
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,320
Come in.

352
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,210
What is it? Is there anything else?

353
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,720
It's nothing,let's go.

354
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,090
Let's go.

355
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,600
What? You were attacked ?

356
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,410
Are you all right? -It's nothing serious.

357
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,320
Do you know who was behind it?

358
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,360
My colleagues are investigating this but there's no result yet.

359
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,560
If they are going after me,...

360
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,770
...they wouldn't wait until I've come to the grassland.

361
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,760
Perhaps they want what we're looking for.

362
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,730
Professor Meng,I didn't tell you about this earlier...

363
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,400
...because I was afraid there'd be a chaos.

364
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,060
I have called the station for backup.

365
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,520
I believe that those men would not do anything for now.

366
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,020
I do think that there's something odd with the tomb.

367
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,250
We need to continue our search.

368
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,200
These men are related to Qi Heng's tomb case in Gansu.

369
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,320
Furthermore,they must be looking for more valuable items.

370
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,720
However,this chess doesn't say anything about the tomb master.

371
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,610
There must be other clues around here.

372
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,850
We can't delay this. Let's have another exploration tomorrow.

373
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,680
All right. -Go!

374
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,440
Who is giving me trouble now?

375
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,330
What is it? What do you want?

376
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,720
You look angry. Did you lose again?

377
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,240
You are out there working...

378
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,720
...and I'm at home playing against primary school children.

379
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,680
I get it now. Advocating for school children...

380
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,980
...to have less work is unnecessary.

381
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,970
What's so funny?

382
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,640
Tell me what it is.

383
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:24,400
It's like this. Grandfather, I'll send a photo to you.

384
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,920
I need my glasses.

385
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,800
You need it now but not when you're playing games?

386
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,600
Games require brainpower, all right?

387
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,410
If I wear glasses, it'll be bad for my eyes.

388
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,180
Tell me,what is it?

389
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,850
We have located the tomb and have excavated the area.

390
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,200
What did you find?

391
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,400
Grandfather,prior to this...

392
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,240
...I thought that tomb raiding novels were fictional.

393
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,000
However,I learned that ancient people have many ways...

394
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,400
...of preventing tombs from being raided.

395
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,840
You finally get it.

396
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,440
Although the novels have elements of exaggeration...

397
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,040
...but there is something you can learn from them.

398
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,800
Different eras,different places and different corpses.

399
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,120
The traps for each tomb will be different,understand?

400
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,320
That's right. We met with something odd this time.

401
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,720
The coffin was opened...

402
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,960
...but the tomb master's body wasn't there.

403
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,040
There was only this jade chess.

404
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,760
Hold it up for me to see.

405
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,010
Flip over to the other side.

406
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,160
What else did you find out?

407
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,920
The jade figurine and this chess are made of similar materials.

408
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,940
The timeline is similar,too.

409
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,300
Professor Meng is troubled by this,too.

410
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,400
Seeing that there is only a jade chess in the tomb,...

411
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,060
...there must be another mechanism.

412
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,320
There must be hidden tombs that your team have missed.

413
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,800
Hidden tombs?

414
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,410
There is a possibility.

415
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,720
Let's not come to any conclusion.

416
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,580
If the condition permits, I'd suggest another discovery.

417
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,080
All right. I will suggest this to Professor Meng.

418
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,680
Wait a minute. How is Zhuang Rui doing?

419
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,080
Zhuang Rui? He's not doing too well.

420
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,040
No,wait a minute. What do you mean?
