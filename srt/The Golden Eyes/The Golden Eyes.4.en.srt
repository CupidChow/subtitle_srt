1
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,800
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,800
Episode 4

3
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,240
Careful. Make sure it's straight.

4
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,090
Careful. Make it straight. That's right.

5
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,680
Don't let them touch.

6
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,080
Hold on. What are you in-charge of?

7
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,800
I heard that an archaeologist team is doing some work,I came to see.

8
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,600
This is not a restaurant.

9
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,200
It's rare for a young lad like you to be...

10
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,530
...interested in an archaeologist site.

11
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,850
Professor Meng.

12
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,400
You..... You know me?

13
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,040
I'm a history student of Beijing University.

14
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,240
I'm Zhuang Rui and I'm a fan of yours.

15
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,560
I've read your articles and been your lectures.

16
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,880
We didn't expect to bum into our students here.

17
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,760
Yes. It's like a wilderness here.

18
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,040
You came here just to see us archaeologist work?

19
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,160
I came for a friend's wedding.

20
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,440
Then,I heard there's an archaeological site here.

21
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,800
Normally,I like history and archaeology.

22
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,600
What did you say your name is?

23
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,400
I'm Zhuang Rui. -Xiao Zhuang.

24
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,440
Since you said you graduated from Beijing University,...

25
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,600
...let me test you.

26
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,000
Here. Look. Look at our place.

27
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,260
Whose tomb do you think we are searching for?

28
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,120
Historical literature has no record of emperor's tomb in Gansu.

29
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,280
So,it's certainly not a royal tomb,but Gansu...

30
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,160
...is the must-pass site where the Western Regions gather.

31
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,040
It should be the tombs of the fallen generals when...

32
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,520
...Central Plains conquered the countries of the Western Regions.

33
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,600
I'm not sure about the exact dynasty and general.

34
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,640
You live up to your name. You haven't embarrassed us.

35
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,200
Yes. We're searching for General Qi Yuan's tomb,...

36
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,960
...who conquered Arabic countries during Tang Dynasty.

37
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,090
There are still many royal tombs not yet discovered.

38
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,200
Why are you searching for a general's tomb?

39
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,520
The archaeological community never actively explores any tombs.

40
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,850
Only when the tomb is destroyed will we explore to rescue it.

41
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,280
It's easy to discover it but difficult to preserve it.

42
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,970
I still remember when I discovered Dingling,...

43
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,720
...numerous precious paintings and silks in front of us...

44
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,120
...were undergoing oxidative fading.

45
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,280
I could just watch and do nothing.

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,520
That's the pain of an archaeologist.

47
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,120
Are you saying that Qi Yuan's tomb is ruined?

48
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,800
We're not certain yet...

49
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,040
...but we've received a call from the local archaeological site,...

50
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,970
...saying that there are many grave robberies here.

51
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,040
We still can't find the tomb's whereabouts now.

52
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,120
Most importantly,there should be some metals...

53
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,120
...or some valuable bronze items inside the tomb,...

54
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,650
...but when we explore the whole area,...

55
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,720
...we only found some bronze coins.

56
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,720
So,General Qi Yuan's tomb is likely not here.

57
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,600
Why are you in a rush?

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,159
If we can easily explore and find a tomb,...

59
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,280
...won't all the tombs in the country be robbed?

60
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,760
Now,we know that Qi Yuan's tomb is at the border of Lintao.

61
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,480
Besides,we have brought many modern equipment.

62
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,000
We should be able to find it.

63
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,120
Oh right,young man! You're Xiao Zhuang,right?

64
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,160
I see that you are knowledgeable about archaeology.

65
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,560
If you are really interested in our work,...

66
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,880
...and you have nothing to do,come and drop by.

67
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,560
You're welcomed to join us. -Am I?

68
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,040
Of course. -You're welcomed.

69
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,900
You have to be mentally prepared.

70
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,720
This looks simple but it's actually tiring.

71
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,000
Can you persevere? -No problem.

72
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,760
Professor,a police officer is looking for you.

73
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,120
Carry on. I'll return soon. -Sure.

74
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,960
I'm in class 2. Which class are you from?

75
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,840
I'm in class 1.

76
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,800
Professor Meng,I heard there are many grave robberies here.

77
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,880
Yes,we've found many grave robberies here...

78
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,080
...but the sites we found are not tombs.

79
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,760
I guess the tomb isn't far from here.

80
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,120
Look.

81
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,720
Zhuang Rui?

82
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,160
Do you know him,too? He is a student from our university.

83
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,290
He's quite good.

84
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,200
From the pawnshop robbery to being robbed in Panjiayuan,...

85
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,680
...and even here,he was at every place that we investigate.

86
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,000
Is this a coincidence? -Sister,is he really...

87
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,120
...a spy from the grave robbers? -We can't rule this out.

88
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,450
He looks honest though.

89
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,520
Those who look innocent...

90
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,480
...are those we should be careful with.

91
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,170
Do we want to apply to arrest him first?

92
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,000
Don't act rashly. We don't want to alert the culprit.

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,200
Just watch him. He will show his true colour. We'll arrest him...

94
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,600
...and find out the mastermind behind him.

95
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,200
Boss,I've arrived in Gansu.

96
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,800
I'll meet Boss Yu in a while. -Okay.

97
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,220
Be careful at all times. -Yes.

98
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,480
You can't even grab the broken jade.

99
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,600
How can you still say you're professional?

100
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,920
Brother Mang,we are professional grave robbers...

101
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,720
...but we aren't skilled in robbery.

102
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,760
Do you mean that I have found the wrong person?

103
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,150
No.

104
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,340
You didn't find the wrong person.

105
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,200
We did ruined the pawn robbery...

106
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,720
...but we are experts in grave robbery. Don't worry.

107
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,720
We will certainly obtain the thing you want this time.

108
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,440
There is an archaeological team arriving from Beijing.

109
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,120
When are you going to start?

110
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,010
In 2 days.

111
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,480
The archaeological team is here.

112
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,080
It'd be obvious if we blow up the place.

113
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,680
After 2 days,there is a wedding. When the firecrackers are lit,...

114
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,810
...we will blow the place. There will not be any mistake.

115
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,410
What's more,...

116
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,410
...I hope you can be more professional this time.

117
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,280
Don't worry,Brother Mang. We are always professional.

118
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,120
Go ahead. -Boss Yu has found out...

119
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,840
...the exact address of the tomb. They will start in these 2 days.

120
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,200
They will kill anyone who stops them.

121
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,480
I'm not a murderer. Neither am I a grave robber.

122
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,440
You don't need to tell me these. I just want the jade beads.

123
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,800
Continue to head towards W 225?.

124
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,000
You're using advanced technology these days.

125
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,840
This isn't advanced technology. It's common now. GPS and aerial camera...

126
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,380
...help us to conduct large-scale surveys and explorations.

127
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,240
It saves a lot of manpower and material resources.

128
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,320
However,for thousands of years,...

129
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,880
...the terrain and the landscape have undergone tremendous changes.

130
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,140
Is there a high possibility to find General Qi Yuan's tomb?

131
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,720
If the survey is easy,why do we need to work for this?

132
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,040
Don't worry. It's difficult,but it's not impossible.

133
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,680
We are now collecting many topographical features...

134
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,680
...to find out the irregularities.

135
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,740
Finding irregularities?

136
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,960
Print a few more of those copies. I want to have a look.

137
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,760
Xiao Zhuang,I'll teach you when there's a chance.

138
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,760
Professor,we have been searching for almost a day.

139
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,520
There's still not a single clue.

140
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,440
There is nothing in the suburbs or the Gobi.

141
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,400
Let the aerial camera rest. We will search again in a while.

142
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:23,760
Okay.

143
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,320
Xiao Zhuang,back to your question.

144
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,960
It's been many years and the landscape has changed a lot.

145
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,920
If there is an area...

146
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,040
...which looks different from the others,...

147
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,200
...what do you think this means?

148
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,800
It means in the history,someone has modified it before.

149
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,520
Yes. Everything in nature seems random.

150
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,000
In fact,they are of natural order.

151
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,960
If humans modify the landscape,...

152
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,700
...they will certainly ruin the order and leave marks behind.

153
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,120
So,the aerial camera isn't used to find the location,...

154
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,440
...but to find out the suspicious area.

155
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,200
You are clever.

156
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,840
Big brother,we have to turn left at the next junction.

157
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,680
Hello,sister. The sheep have come out.

158
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,330
Watch him. You must find out his superiors this time.

159
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:51,840
Sure.

160
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,800
Look at this bottle. Look at the work...

161
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,380
...and the design.

162
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,880
The work is great.

163
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,720
How do you think they created this back then?

164
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,920
These are treasures.

165
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,780
This picture from Qing Dynasty is great.

166
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,800
Do you think this is pretty? -Do you think this looks nice?

167
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,520
It's pretty! The composition is great!

168
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:41,720
Hello!

169
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,480
Hello! -Hello!

170
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,440
Hello!

171
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,280
Hello! -What is it? It's noisy!

172
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,320
Is there a war? -No,I'm in the car.

173
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,640
A car? It's more like a tank. -No.

174
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,560
My friend is driving a tractor.

175
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,400
You're carpooling. Alright. That's great.

176
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,960
The villager is kind. -Yes,everyone is kind to you.

177
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,400
What did you say? It's too noisy. -The noise is from your side.

178
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,680
What? -I'm hanging up.

179
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,440
I'm at a private auction. -What? Private auction?

180
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,680
Yes.

181
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,920
Uncle De asked me to come and learn.

182
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,120
You're working hard to earn money. I can't trouble you.

183
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,360
No,please don't. Don't spend money impulsively.

184
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,240
Don't worry. I'll remember Uncle De's advice.

185
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,600
Listen and watch more. Shop but don't buy.

186
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,520
Sure. -No worries. I'm fine.

187
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,160
What's going on? What's wrong with this young man?

188
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,600
Look at this young man. -Hundreds of thousands.

189
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,720
It's not me. -I saw you broke it.

190
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,880
He's clumsy. It's a shame.

191
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,240
It's not me.

192
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,490
Thank you,big brother. You're very kind.

193
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,180
The ground has been modified before.

194
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,010
Hello,Professor Meng.

195
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,109
Little brother,it's you.

196
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:17,349
Never thought that we will meet again so soon.

197
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,160
Xiao Huang,right?

198
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,560
Huangfu Yun. My surname is Huangfu.

199
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,829
I'm sorry.

200
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,160
Your ancestor is the Grand Master of the Western Zhou?

201
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,240
Is it?

202
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,720
You don't even know your own ancestor.

203
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,560
No,I know. I just don't know he's an important person.

204
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,880
Fine. Let's skip the nonsense.

205
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,360
Xiao Huang. Mr. Huangfu.

206
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,400
Do you admit you broke this?

207
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,560
No,Mr. Qian. It's like this.

208
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,280
I don't think this has anything to do with me.

209
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,660
Just now,someone pushed me from behind. Then.....

210
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,840
Then,is that person around?

211
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,300
The security guard only saw you lying on the cabinet alone.

212
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,880
Yes. That showcase was knocked down by me,...

213
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,000
...but.....

214
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,840
Mr. Qian,you're talented and knowledgeable.

215
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,760
I want to ask you. Was there any Ru ware...

216
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,610
...during the Warring States period?

217
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,760
There was no Ru ware. This is modern art.

218
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,840
Then,it's easy.

219
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,840
As rich people,we will do things according to rules.

220
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,720
I knocked down this. How much is it? I'll pay for it.

221
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,720
You're straightforward. -Right?

222
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,120
Let me tell you honestly,too. This isn't mine.

223
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,880
Someone brought here to be sold. Just pay the original price.

224
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,360
Then,I will inform the owner.

225
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,560
Sure.

226
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,040
Have a look. These are the items.

227
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,770
What are these? -This is the certificate.

228
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,300
There's no need to see. -Consignment contract.

229
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,320
What is this? This transfer slip. -No problem.

230
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,840
Have a look.

231
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,000
How is it? Is anything wrong?

232
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,010
There's no problem.

233
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,560
Two million?

234
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,000
Mr. Qian,are you joking with me?

235
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,600
What? Rich people like you...

236
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,760
...should follow rules,right?

237
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,240
You're obviously scamming me.

238
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,280
How do you know?

239
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,440
This is the truth.

240
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,880
You can't say something like that. It's not nice.

241
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,320
Mr. Huangfu,what do you think?

242
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,500
Should I help you to make a police report?

243
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,640
Don't worry,Mr. Xu.

244
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,560
The 2 young men...

245
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,920
...will never stay in Panjiayuan anymore.

246
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,240
They are broke after losing 1 to 2 million.

247
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,260
How dare they mess with me?

248
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,560
They are ignorant. They have offended you.

249
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,600
Why don't they quickly die and change their fate?

250
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,360
Lao Qian,you have done well.

251
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,040
I've learned it from you. Don't you mention that.

252
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,080
Haven't I told you? I'm part of your family.

253
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,840
The soil is different in colour.

254
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,500
How did you find out,Xiao Zhuang?

255
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,890
I found this place when I was using the aerial camera.

256
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,360
As you were busy,I came here to check by myself.

257
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,560
It's strange indeed.

258
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,400
You're really lucky.

259
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,060
What is this in your hand? -This is a scanner.

260
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,980
I found that the soil has been dug out before.

261
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,890
The colour was different from the surroundings.

262
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,280
When I passed by here,I scanned and found this.

263
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,800
I don't know why a room suddenly showed up.

264
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,080
However,we can't see anything from this picture alone.

265
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,400
Xiao Zhuang,this is not luck. You have great eyesight.

266
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,600
He found that the soil colour is different here.

267
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,200
Yes.

268
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,410
Are you interested in joining us? -Me?

269
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,920
I'm afraid I can't help with anything.

270
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,800
You're too humble.

271
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,000
Xiao Ren,ask for a social officer from Beijing to come over.

272
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,760
Okay. -Welcome to our team!

273
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,570
Congratulations,Xiao Zhuang! -Let's go and have a look there.

274
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,570
Sure. -Let's go.

275
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
Is this not a Luoyang shovel? -Yes.

276
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,160
Isn't this the grave robbers'? -Yes.

277
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,360
This shovel is created by Li Ya Zi...

278
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,760
...to rob the graves in early last century,...

279
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,200
...but because of its irreplaceable practicality,...

280
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,920
...it has been included as the necessary tool for archaeology.

281
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,300
To grave robbers,the shovel's for excavation and grave robbery.

282
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,170
To us,it's to protect the cultural heritage.

283
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,520
Knowing how to use Luoyang shovel to distinguish soil...

284
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,050
...is the fundamental for an archaeologist.

285
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,460
Is anyone here?

286
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,060
Is anyone here?

287
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,400
Hello. -Who let you in?

288
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,240
Go out! -Friend,we are here.....

289
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,300
Who is your friend? -What is going on?

290
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,440
What is it? What happened? -Nothing.

291
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,760
It's our fault for coming in by ourselves.

292
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,140
However,it's your fault for pushing us.

293
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,520
Two days ago,someone tried to steal things here.

294
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,520
I broke that man's leg. Do you want to try?

295
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,890
I think you have misunderstood. We aren't here to steal.

296
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,810
What is going on?

297
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,680
Officer Miao,why are you here?

298
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,280
Are you looking for a fight? -No.

299
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,200
We are not.

300
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,770
It's just a misunderstanding.

301
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,120
Do you need the police to solve this?

302
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,170
No,there's no need. We have made it clear.

303
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,810
We are tourists from Beijing. -Tourists.

304
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,920
We are tourists who just passed here by.

305
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,160
We didn't know there are residents here. We thought it's for viewing.

306
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,920
I'm sorry for disturbing. Let's go. Hurry.

307
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,920
Let's go.

308
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,160
Professor,what happened just now?

309
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,600
We'll talk when we return. Let's go.

310
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,640
This young man again.

311
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,400
Boss,do you know those people?

312
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,480
The archaeological team from Beijing.

313
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,880
They are also aiming for our targeted spot.

314
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,460
Hold on. Does that mean...

315
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,520
...they found out about the tomb underneath this house?

316
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,200
Why are they so quick?

317
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,440
We have searched for half a year.

318
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,300
I never thought that the police are this efficient.

319
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,900
I think this has to do with that young man from the pawnshop.

320
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,160
Don't you think this is strange?

321
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,840
There will be trouble whenever I see him.

322
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,080
Before we do anything,...

323
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,000
...let's kill him first.

324
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,380
Did you notice that person has a scar on his face?

325
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,800
It's a burn mark and it's new. -What's the problem?

326
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,680
A decayed body inside the tomb will accumulate biogas.

327
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,680
If you rush to open the tomb using flame torch,you will be burned.

328
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,680
I know. This is the "fire hole" we often talk about.

329
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,920
You even know about this. He really knows a lot.

330
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,000
This means the person just now may be a grave robber.

331
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,120
No wonder he is not friendly.

332
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,540
Officer Miao was there. Why didn't she just arrest him?

333
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,880
Although we know the tomb is here,...

334
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,360
...we don't know the exact place. We don't want to alert them.

335
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,200
Then,have they entered the tomb? -I think not.

336
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,440
After the robbers enter the tomb,they will use half a day...

337
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,170
...to quickly move everything. They won't stay.

338
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,920
I think they are in the preparation stage.

339
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,450
Yes. -So,Officer Miao,...

340
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,320
...I suggest you to watch them. Once they start,arrest them.

341
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,360
We can't arrest them yet. -Why?

342
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,680
Professor Meng,let's talk for a while.

343
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,560
Well,what's going on?

344
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,920
Professor Meng,what you said just now was just a guess.

345
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,850
There is no concrete evidence.

346
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,800
Even if we know that person is a grave robber,...

347
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,200
...we need to wait for the boss to show up...

348
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,860
...before we can do anything.

349
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,120
Executing the illegal cultural relics gangs behind...

350
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,180
...is our main objective. -But.....

351
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,880
But,there are treasures inside General Qi Yuan's tomb.

352
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,520
If we allow the grave robbers to enter the tomb,...

353
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,800
...the cultural relics will be ruined.

354
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,960
Even if the grave robbers in Gansu are arrested today,...

355
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,360
...the gang will continue their activities in other places.

356
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,200
This means that there are more tombs in danger.

357
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,320
I hope you can understand. -Yes.

358
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,280
But if they enter the tomb and ruin the relics.....

359
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,080
Don't worry,we will do our best to stop them...

360
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,460
...and protect the cultural relics.

361
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:42,920
All right.

362
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,640
Xiao Zhuang,Xiao Ren,keep the equipment!

363
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,360
Okay. -Wait!

364
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,700
Why are you part of the archaeological team now?

365
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,060
Professor Meng said I have good eyesight and I can help her.

366
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,980
Once you're done,look for me in town. I have questions for you.

367
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,120
What is it?

368
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,360
Sister,the sheep is really problematic.

369
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,480
He actually went to the orchard to find the tomb...

370
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,610
...and managed to find it. Don't you think it's strange?

371
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,480
The most strange thing is...

372
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,160
...he is asked to help by the archaeological team.

373
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,080
Is it Dongfeng Skewer?

374
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,840
Is it Dongfeng Skewer?

375
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,320
Yes.

376
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,120
I see you. It's opposite the road.

377
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,220
Just come here.

378
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,080
It's him. Go there.

379
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,180
Don't move!

380
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,000
Why did he take so long to cross the road?

381
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,700
Sister,there is something going on behind the car.

382
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,700
This is bad.

383
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,520
Who are you? -Quick!

384
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,360
Don't move! Police! -Retreat!

385
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,960
Retreat! -Quick!

386
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,370
Let's go!

387
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,720
Are you alright? What's going on? -Arrest them!

388
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,920
They are those who robbed the pawnshop!

389
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,380
Officer,why aren't you arresting them?

390
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,800
You were blindfolded just now. How can you see his face clearly?

391
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:07,840
I.....

392
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,840
I saw them before they blindfolded me.

393
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,160
They are those in the pawnshop.

394
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,460
Do you mean that...

395
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:26,000
...you saw their faces when you were in the pawnshop?

396
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,040
You answered differently when I asked you for the first time.

397
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,280
No. I must be in shock.

398
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,700
Officer,please don't be so scary. I'm easily shocked.

399
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,290
If you continue to scare me,I'll forget many things.

400
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,380
I'll give you another chance.

401
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,360
This is a human face library. Find the criminals.

402
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,160
No,I..... I don't know how to do this.

403
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,080
This young man is quite lucky.

404
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,040
Yes,boss. I also think it's strange.

405
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,640
He was blindfolded,but how can he move around?

406
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,200
Strange? I think you are even stranger.

407
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,640
You've already blindfolded him yet you still can't catch him.

408
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,560
I never thought that the female officer is good.

409
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:55,520
Let's not worry about him. We need to do our job first.

410
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,160
No,boss,look at me. My face...

411
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,480
...isn't healed yet. I'm afraid it will affect my ability.

412
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,640
Lao San,when your parents named you San Xing,...

413
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,560
...they wanted you to contemplate daily,but look at you.

414
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,720
You're lazy to use your brain.

415
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,800
Do you know why I don't bring you to Beijing?

416
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,360
I'm afraid they'd say we aren't professional.

417
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,160
Is there someone in our field as fat as you?

418
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,280
Look at you.

419
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,080
It's a fire hole,yet you entered it while smoking.

420
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,800
Use it. Does it still hurt?

421
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,960
No. -Lao San.

422
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,080
You aren't married yet. Your face is important.

423
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,520
If we failed this,we're doomed.

424
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Tell me. Do you want your life or your face?

425
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,179
Then,I don't want my face. I want my life.

426
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,580
Be careful.

427
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,800
Brothers,are you done? -Yes.

428
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,080
Okay.

429
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:33,790
When the firecrackers are lit up tomorrow,...

430
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,320
...we will blow it up. -Okay!

431
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:49,880
No.

432
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,920
What about this? -No,it's not.

433
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,800
No. -Let's try another.

434
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,280
Sister,can we trust him?

435
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,010
He answers differently each time. He must be hiding something.

436
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,740
Besides,he hopes we can catch the suspects now.

437
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,120
Let's try another. -You should change the eyebrow.

438
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,680
This. -Then only he can help himself.

439
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,040
I really don't remember. -Think again.

440
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,560
The eyes.

441
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,240
Are you sure?

442
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,800
The calls keep coming in. Answer it.

443
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,280
Use the loudspeaker.

444
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:42,960
Hello.

445
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,530
Xiao Rui Rui,...

446
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,520
...I'm sorry.

447
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,400
I broke an item.

448
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,840
They want me to pay 2 million.

449
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,400
2 million? What's it?

450
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,480
A Ru ware from the Warring States period.

451
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,600
A Ru ware? There is none in the Warring States period.

452
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,200
I know now there is no such a thing.

453
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,920
Who is it? This is a scam.

454
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,800
Qian Yaosi,Mr. Qian.

455
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,640
He said it very clearly. He wants to scam me.

456
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,720
Fine. Don't worry. I'll go back and help you.

457
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,560
Sure. Hurry and come back.

458
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,520
Xiao Rui Rui,I need you.

459
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,640
Sure. Hurry and pay him.

460
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,760
Quickly come back.

461
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,720
Okay.

462
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,440
Is he your boyfriend? -No,he's my childhood friend.

463
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,720
My childhood friend. -You're quite rich.

464
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,800
You give 2 million away just like that. Where did you get the money?

465
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,120
I earned it with him through buying a painting.

466
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,100
A picture costs 2 million?

467
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,900
The whole of Panjiayuan knows about it. Don't you know?

468
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,720
Xiao Zhao,investigate it. -Yes.

469
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,960
What's it? -I'm posting it in my Moment.

470
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,680
I'm recording my current feelings.

471
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,340
Complete the picture.

472
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,880
I have drawn the eyes.

473
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,280
The night in Northwest China is so long.

474
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,680
Hello.

475
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,160
Why are you posting so late at night? Aren't you sleeping?

476
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,160
Well,I can't sleep.

477
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,640
Why are you in the Northwest? Where is it?

478
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,800
A small place,Lintao.

479
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,080
I'm attending my friend's wedding.

480
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,160
What are you doing?

481
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,400
I.....

482
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,880
You can't speak now?

483
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,520
I'm out with my friend.

484
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,660
Is your friend a woman?

485
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,280
It's a man.

486
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,760
I'm calling to thank you for the bamboo item.

487
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,890
I really like it.

488
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,760
Really? That's great.

489
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,280
Fine,I won't disturb you anymore. Rest early.

490
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:49,940
Good night.

491
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,500
Good night.

492
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,260
Complete the picture.

493
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,090
Hold it right there.

494
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,200
Who asked you to move around?

495
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,720
Officer,I want to move around.

496
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,000
Are you sure it's him?

497
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,010
It should be him.

498
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,320
Yu Lei.

499
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,290
The people from Jianghu calls him Brother Yu.

500
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,360
I think he's your gang leader.
