1
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,500
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,500
Episode 17

3
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,450
Why don't...

4
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,340
...you become my bodyguard first...

5
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,240
...before you get a new job?

6
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,440
You've just resigned and don't have much saving.

7
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,760
Don't buy expensive wine again. Stop staying in the hotel.

8
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,040
Let Huang Fuyun arrange for you.

9
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,240
Why do you need me as a bodyguard?

10
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,330
Isn't Pengfei your bodyguard?

11
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,400
It's safer to have...

12
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,760
...another bodyguard.

13
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,400
Are you sure?

14
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,840
Boss,...

15
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,420
...give me five bottles of vodka.

16
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,200
My boss will pay the bill.

17
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,040
The paintings must be expensive.

18
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,240
He got this painting.

19
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Do you like it?

20
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,260
Portrait of Jeanne Hebuterne in a large hat by Modigliani.

21
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,930
You love this painting since you were in high school.

22
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,159
Long time no see,Xuanbing.

23
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,480
I heard that you were injured. Are you okay?

24
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,920
The Dean of the Royal College of Medicine is staying at my house.

25
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,720
Shall I bring you for a check-up?

26
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,720
It's okay. I'm fine. Thank you.

27
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,600
Let me introduce you some new friends.

28
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,680
Who is he?

29
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,080
He's my good friend from mainland,Zhuang Rui.

30
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,280
He's an expert of antiques...

31
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,440
...who helped my father to get many valuable jade.

32
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,080
My father paid a lot of effort to get him as our consultant.

33
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,130
Nice to meet you. -When I saw this painting...

34
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,160
...for the first time, it reminded me of you.

35
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,700
I've seen many paintings over the years.

36
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,480
The woman in Modigliani's paintings is the most beautiful...

37
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,420
...because...

38
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,520
...he only drew the eyes of the woman that he love.

39
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,360
The appraiser...

40
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,560
...said that it isn't a good artwork...

41
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,600
...and it is worth only around USD 40 million.

42
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,960
I'm not good in paintings.

43
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,520
Please give me some guidance in the future,Mr. Zhuang.

44
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,280
I'm not up to it. I'm not good in paintings.

45
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,360
However,the frame looks good.

46
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,920
The frame is made from Zijin...

47
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,340
...because I bought a few Zijin mines few years ago.

48
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,560
I have many collections so I asked the craftsman from France

49
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,620
...to make a batch of frames. I can give you a few of them.

50
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,050
It's okay. Do you want to give me the frames or the paintings?

51
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,440
Isn't your family doing shipping business?

52
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,800
This is just for entertainment.

53
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,200
You're Xuanbing's friend, therefore you're my friend,too.

54
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,680
If you need to ship antiques or jade in the future,...

55
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,960
...I may help you.

56
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,880
It's okay. My shop is small.

57
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:38,200
There aren't many antiques in my shop.

58
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,040
It's okay. -You're too humble.

59
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:45,280
Ukraine is rich in Zijin. If you're interested,...

60
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,440
...we may find some souvenirs here.

61
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,320
Xuanbing, they're waiting for us.

62
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,250
Let's go.

63
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,960
Let him join us.

64
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,600
Why isn't Xiaorui back yet? I'm so nervous!

65
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,560
He may be entertaining. Since we have nothing to do,...

66
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,480
...why are you so nervous? -We have nothing to do...

67
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,290
...but Miss Xiaojia replied my message just now.

68
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,500
I don't know how to reply her message.

69
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,600
Zhuang Rui has promised to help Miss Xiaojia and I.

70
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,210
Isn't Inspector Miao here? Why don't you ask her?

71
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,040
I've screenshot the message to her. She asked me...

72
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,860
...to pray for myself.

73
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,920
What was the message about? Was it so scary?

74
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:57,560
Didn't I tell you just now? It was "Hehe".

75
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,240
You may reply her the same thing.

76
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,640
Pengfei,you're getting old.

77
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,360
You have to be smart to find a girlfriend.

78
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,600
You're smart but you can't find a girlfriend,too.

79
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,160
Xiaorui,please come back quick! Without you,...

80
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,620
...I can only reply her message by tomorrow.

81
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:36,400
Xiaorui has to come back quick. If not,I won't be able to sleep.

82
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,880
Let me toast everyone...

83
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,040
...to welcome Xuanbing.

84
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,480
The alcohol content is high. Let me drink for you.

85
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,580
I'll drink for her.

86
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,360
Mr. Zhuang,we're going to finish all the wine here.

87
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,160
Can you drink for her?

88
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,080
Waitress.

89
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,280
Xiaorui,you're finally back! I...

90
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,520
...have been waiting for you!

91
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,760
He's so heavy! Come and help me!

92
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,520
Why is he drunk? -Don't sleep first.

93
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,280
Tell me how to reply Miss Xiaojia.

94
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,640
Hehe. -Alright.

95
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,040
Hehe?

96
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,640
Are you sure?

97
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,000
Xiaorui,you have to help me!

98
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,720
Is there anything special about Zhuang Rui's eyes?

99
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,760
No.

100
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,320
Zheng Hua was busy drinking so we didn't play the game.

101
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,970
I couldn't get a chance to observe him.

102
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Zhuang Rui helped me to drink the wine and he was drunk.

103
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,400
I wonder how he is. -Are you worrying about him?

104
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,400
Father, your leg is in pain again.

105
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,290
Let me get you a hot pack.

106
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,800
I'm sorry,father.

107
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,800
You don't have to apologize.

108
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,880
I know you see Zhuang Rui as your friend.

109
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,720
He's a good man,too.

110
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,000
However,if his eyes are special,...

111
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,560
...we should get him to help us instead of others.

112
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,000
If he tries to hide from us,...

113
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,250
...we can try to find out from his friends.

114
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,360
They live together every day.

115
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,480
I'm sure they know the truth.

116
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,920
Huang Fuyun and Pengfei? -Yes.

117
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,200
Who is Zheng Hua? -He is Xuanbing's friend.

118
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,020
Why must he ask you out?

119
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,480
I was drunk because of him. He wants to apologize...

120
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,680
...and show me around. -I'll follow you. Be careful.

121
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,240
Sure.

122
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,640
Hi! -Zhuang Rui,get in.

123
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,920
Why are the rich in Ukraine so bad?

124
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,160
Xiaorui...

125
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,120
...was drunk last night!

126
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,840
Why kind of friends are they? They can't treat him like that.

127
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,120
Are they trying to make trouble?

128
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,400
You lost your job as a police...

129
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:03,360
...and come to Ukraine to drink. Don't you feel shy?

130
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,400
Get up now!

131
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,280
You spat in my face.

132
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,460
I don't have much savings.

133
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,160
I just want to enjoy myself at a place where no one knows me.

134
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,050
Who knows that you are here?

135
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,440
Zhuang Rui and Pengfei have gone out. Why didn't you follow them?

136
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,880
I'm not interested in Qin Xuanbing's friends.

137
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,850
Let Pengfei go with him.

138
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,720
This is your fault,too.

139
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,760
Why didn't you bring Miss Xiaojia along?

140
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,080
I have to buy a gift for her later.

141
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,280
It'll be great...

142
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:54,720
...if Miss Xiaojia and I...

143
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,890
...are like you and Zhuang Rui.

144
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,800
Stop talking nonsense!

145
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,080
Xiaoyun asked me to get you some medicine...

146
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,280
...as wine isn't good for your stomach.

147
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,640
Mr. Zheng,please stop at the pharmacy later.

148
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,970
I'll get some medicine.

149
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,800
It's okay. I have all sorts of medicine at my place.

150
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,560
Zhuang Rui,you have a good worker.

151
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,960
No,he's my friend. -Friend?

152
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,240
I'm quite curious...

153
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,800
...how Xuanbing and you become friends.

154
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,560
I have no idea,too.

155
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,960
I think it's because I gave her a grasshopper.

156
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,380
A grasshopper?

157
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,760
Interesting!

158
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,100
Good morning,Mr. Zheng. -Let me introduce.

159
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,140
This is my friend,Zhuang Rui. This is Chen Yong.

160
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,320
Hi.

161
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,010
Mr. Zheng,this way please.

162
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,800
I heard that you have a big museum...

163
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,640
...with many gems in it.

164
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,000
When can I see it?

165
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,040
Xuanbing told me that you have a good taste.

166
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,800
I'll bring you there next time.

167
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,840
What do you mean by next time? Isn't this a museum?

168
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,850
This is a fencing hall. Since Xuanbing isn't around,...

169
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,800
...let me show you something different.

170
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:07,770
Let's go!

171
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,000
The fencing hall looks so grand!

172
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,360
You're great!

173
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,130
It's been a long time since I practised it.

174
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,460
Moreover,I was drunk last night. I'm not his match.

175
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,680
Brother Hua,you're too humble. You attacked him well...

176
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,320
...and your moves were smooth.

177
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,700
You're an expert,too! -I learned it in university.

178
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,160
Give it a try! -No,I can't.

179
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,000
As a man,how could you say that? -I'll do it then.

180
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:47,930
Stop!

181
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,160
Chen Yong,Zhuang Rui is my friend. You should be nice to him.

182
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,960
I'm sorry. -It's okay.

183
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,280
This match is my pleasure. -No way!

184
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,000
He was rude to you.

185
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Stop playing. Be the judge. -Okay.

186
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,920
You looked professional. -I learned it in university.

187
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,520
Since we are here, we should enjoy ourselves.

188
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,520
The rich in Europe send their sons to learn fencing...

189
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,000
...and they think...

190
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,320
...a man can maintain his dignity through fencing.

191
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,180
Come on.

192
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,200
I don't want to shop anymore! What do you want to buy?

193
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,600
This is the last shop. I must be serious...

194
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,600
...to choose Miss Xiaojia's gift. -You stay here then.

195
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,760
I shall go back first. -No! This is the last shop.

196
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,360
Let's go in this shop. We'll go back after this.

197
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,800
This is the last one. -Yes.

198
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,000
If you still can't get a gift, you'll stay here.

199
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,880
There are many bears in Ukraine.

200
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,920
Who knows one of the bears may hit you?

201
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,920
I wonder if anyone will save you.

202
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,880
Sure! Let's go!

203
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,920
I'm blind.

204
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,580
My father loves this sport...

205
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,120
...because he thinks the rules of fencing show good values.

206
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,800
No matter why the opponent falls down,...

207
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,540
...we can't attack him again.

208
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,760
Moreover,it is suitable for brave men.

209
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,680
Those who attack first will have the priority.

210
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,440
It's your fault. This is really the last shop.

211
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,640
Are you happy now?

212
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,320
Police work for the people. We need you now.

213
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,320
Figure out a way now. -Shut up!

214
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,840
They only have a gun. I need you now.

215
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,620
What are you doing?

216
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,520
Didn't you say we can't attack if the opponent falls down?

217
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,320
The rule is for the opponent who is on a par with me.

218
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,720
Are you on a par with me?

219
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,040
What are you talking about? Aren't we friends?

220
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,280
I think there should always be a winner and a loser in a game.

221
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,000
It doesn't matter between friends. However,I'm not sure...

222
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,740
...whether you're my friend.

223
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,320
What are you talking about?

224
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,400
To be my friend, we can't like the same thing.

225
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,880
There are things which I can't give it to you...

226
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,080
...such as a woman.

227
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,320
It's difficult to be your friend. I'm not up for it.

228
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,120
It's difficult to be my friend. You're not fit to be one.

229
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,560
I can slap you as I wish!

230
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,520
Leave them alone.

231
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,800
Thank you so much.

232
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,280
Are you okay? -I'm fine.

233
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,760
Have you called the police?

234
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,440
What's wrong? Have some water.

235
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,520
Fei,have you been in a relationship?

236
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,640
I..... -Forget it.

237
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,920
I'll ask Xiaoyun.

238
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,320
Pass me the phone.

239
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,210
It's Xiaorui. Hello,Xiaorui. -Hello,Xiaoyun.

240
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:03,000
Zheng Hua brought me to a fencing hall...

241
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,480
...but he took me as his opponent.

242
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,720
How are you? Are you okay?

243
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,760
I'm fine. I think...

244
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,380
...he likes Qin Xuanbing.

245
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,500
It isn't a big deal!

246
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,760
Do you still remember the skill?

247
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,880
It's similar to fencing.

248
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,240
I think he's not your match.

249
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,440
All right,bye!

250
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,000
Did you hear what we say? -No.

251
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,360
Are you sure that your skill is useful?

252
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,320
Don't look down on it. It's a long-lost skill.

253
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,530
Xiaorui was often bullied when he was a child.

254
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,400
He mastered the skill after some time.

255
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,540
What skill is that?

256
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,600
Hiding!

257
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,320
I told you it was the last shop.

258
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:21,200
We bought the gift and caught the robbers.

259
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,780
It's easy for you to say that. Why don't you try doing it?

260
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:29,080
You even stole something. Don't you feel embarrassed?

261
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,980
Why are you still here?

262
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,480
Let's have another game.

263
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,440
Do you want to lose again?

264
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,000
I think you broke the rule. Therefore,I ask for another game.

265
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,360
Are you afraid of me?

266
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,560
Let's wait and see.

267
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,520
Was my acting good? I'm professional.

268
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Stop talking. Hurry up!

269
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,920
Where are you going?

270
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,840
Do I know you?

271
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:56,440
You were the one who caught my men in the jewellery shop,right?

272
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,120
He's the boss of those men.

273
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,480
What are you talking about? -Nothing!

274
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,170
They are a Chinese man and a Chinese woman.

275
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:12,440
The man is talkative and the woman is violent.

276
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,120
I think it must be two of you. -What are you talking about?

277
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,160
It's the 21 st century now. Why are you still using sticks?

278
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:25,040
Why don't you go back and upgrade your equipment first?

279
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,480
It's hard to control ourselves in a fight.

280
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,080
Two of you...

281
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,800
...even bring a gun to travel.

282
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,730
We didn't bring a gun...

283
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,840
...but...

284
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,560
...we took...

285
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,160
...your gun just now.

286
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:55,920
Run!

287
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,800
Are you sure?

288
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,600
Yes,I'm sure it's them.

289
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,400
They are a Chinese man and a Chinese woman.

290
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,930
The man is talkative and the woman is violent.

291
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,000
It sounds like them.

292
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,040
Great.

293
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,250
What do you mean?

294
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,680
Go over and help them. -Yes.

295
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,360
Hurry up! -I can't run anymore!

296
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,770
They are over there.

297
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,010
Hurry up!

298
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,200
I can't run anymore!

299
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:11,880
Oh no! -Oops!

300
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,640
Break their legs. -They want to break our legs.

301
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
He is.....

302
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,160
They are our guests. Let them go.

303
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,800
You may have it. Thanks!

304
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,840
You are our guests.

305
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,920
We'll protect your safety.

306
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,180
No worries. You may leave now.

307
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,400
What are you trying to do? Don't be reckless.

308
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,240
Take it.

309
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,970
Inspector Miao.

310
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,120
How are you?

311
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,280
I'm fine.

312
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,880
Thank you for saving us.

313
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,840
However,I was a police.

314
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:01,320
I'm used to defeating the villains.

315
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,440
Therefore,I don't really like your solution.

316
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,560
You are Zhuang Rui's friends. I invited Zhuang Rui here,...

317
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,240
...therefore I should take care of you.

318
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,400
Thank you.

319
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,720
Miss,they didn't appreciate our favours. Shall I.....

320
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,560
Let's go.

321
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:53,720
You!

322
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:56,860
You've won.

323
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,290
What do you mean?

324
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,660
It's just a practice. You may win as you wish.

325
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,520
Why were you so serious just now?

326
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,400
For me,result can't represent all.

327
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,920
Do you think you're my match?

328
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,920
It's just a small wound. -It's painful!

329
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,670
Why can't I scream?

330
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,360
I didn't expect it to happen.

331
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,540
The gangsters could even attack people in the daytime.

332
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,850
What a coincidence.

333
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,520
Qin Xuanbing arrived as we were about to be attacked.

334
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,880
I think Qin family is related to them.

335
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,180
If not,she wouldn't be there.

336
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,280
Guns and gambling are legal here.

337
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,080
It's understandable that the gangsters are active here.

338
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,240
No matter how Qin family runs their business,...

339
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:26,240
...they still have to deal with them.

340
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,880
Gambling? Is there a casino here?

341
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,360
I'm just saying.

342
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,120
We should thank Xuanbing for helping you.

343
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,840
Did you hear what we said?

344
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,000
Miss Qin only used her money to settle the problem.

345
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,480
Feifei was the one who saved me.

346
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,960
Am I right? Zheng Hua likes Miss Qin.

347
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,120
He wanted to humiliate Zhuang Rui through fencing.

348
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,720
Why would Miss Qin befriend him?

349
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,300
She may not know his personality.

350
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,120
Xiaorui,did Miss Qin cast a spell on you?

351
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,720
Why are you always on her side? They are the same!

352
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,880
Can you stop now?

353
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:29,880
are you done?  Why are you fighting because of Qin Xuanbing?

354
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,170
Xiaorui,get some medicine. Feifei is injured,too.

355
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,020
Where was she hurt?

356
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,520
Why would I have such a silly friend like you?

357
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,520
Did Zheng Hua bring him to the fencing hall?

358
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,240
Yes.

359
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,640
How is Zhuang Rui? -He's fine.

360
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,080
He solved the problem well.

361
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,080
Young men are naive,...

362
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,080
...especially those like Zheng Hua who lack the experience.

363
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,960
He knows that Zhuang Rui is our guest...

364
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,280
...yet he was rude to him.

365
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,760
Do I have to talk to him?

366
00:37:54,080 --> 00:38:00,520
We can't afford to offend Zheng family.

367
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,920
Let them be. Forget it.

368
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,650
Yes,father.

369
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,920
If there is nothing else, I'll leave first.

370
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,620
Alright,go ahead.

371
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,320
Sir.

372
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,800
Zheng Hua was too reckless,no wonder Xuanbing doesn't like him.

373
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,080
Sir,...

374
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,320
...Zhuang Rui's performance was unexpected.

375
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,800
It's indeed unexpected.

376
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,120
What is Zheng Hua trying to do?

377
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,560
He's too much!

378
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,690
Zhuang Rui, let me read for you.

379
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,200
Dear Mr. Zhuang Rui,...

380
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,800
...we sincerely invite you to attend...

381
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,200
...the party of Chinese Business Association.

382
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,120
The party will be held for two days. There will be a ball...

383
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,120
...and a charity gamble show.

384
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,000
Why is it a charity show?

385
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:40,560
Xiaorui, do you really have to go?

386
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,120
You were hurt last time.

387
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,600
Can't you just stay away from them?

388
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,600
Xuanbing told me that she'll go to the party,too.

389
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,520
Fine,then you just go.

390
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,000
Let's wait for his trick.

391
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,380
If we don't go, it shows that we are timid.

392
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,700
As rich people, we aren't afraid of them!

393
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,120
However,I'm worried about you going alone.

394
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,280
I'm fine going alone.

395
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:30,640
No way.

396
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,920
The ball is starting soon. Let's get changed.

397
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,040
It's a great place!

398
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,650
Xiaofei,let's have a look.

399
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,600
You may rest your mind now.

400
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,520
We haven't attended a ball before.

401
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,370
Let's go!

402
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,280
Feifei.
