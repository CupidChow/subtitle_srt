1
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,500
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,000
Episode 53

3
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,640
Tell me,now that you've escaped from China,...

4
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,160
...what is your plan?

5
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,280
Escape? I wouldn't call it that.

6
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,640
Who is chasing me?

7
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,800
I'm here because I have an important plan.

8
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,960
The antique industry...

9
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,680
...is still motivated by money.

10
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,240
As long as you can grasp the right direction and channel,...

11
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,520
...your current assets will grow by...

12
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,600
...2 to 3 times in just a few minutes.

13
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,320
Speaking about that,...

14
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,680
...I heard that you are not...

15
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,520
...doing well in Kiev recently.

16
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,680
What do you say? Work with me.

17
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,930
Don't beat around the bush.

18
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,450
You are here to get the Tamamoku stone.

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,880
I know about what happened to Qin Haoran and you in China.

20
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,640
Although I'm not sure what you will do with the stone,...

21
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,880
...but as long as you promise to give me what I want,...

22
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,760
...I'll do my best to help you.

23
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,560
As long as you follow my plan,you will obtain what you should have.

24
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,320
Besides,you will also benefit from my future business in Kiev.

25
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,460
Brother De,you are generous.

26
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,760
That's settled then.

27
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,480
Sure,this is my promise. What's with this?

28
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,800
Here,everyone.

29
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,120
Mr. Nakagawa's and my friends. You must be tired of travelling.

30
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,920
If you need anything, just let me know.

31
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,360
Thank you. -Here.

32
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,220
Is the stone still inside the museum's safe?

33
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,640
I check it personally every day.

34
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,800
The stone is extremely safe.

35
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,480
They come here for the stone this time.

36
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,680
Why don't we check now?

37
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,920
Is the stone more important than your body?

38
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,620
You better take a good rest. You just recovered from fainting.

39
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,840
Hurry and eat. -Yes.

40
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,760
Zhuang Rui,you should feel better that the stone is here.

41
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,440
Your main task now is to reduce the side effects...

42
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,700
...of the Golden Eyes.

43
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,240
I have also found the best doctor for you.

44
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,120
I hope this can help you. -Thank you.

45
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,680
Thank you,everyone.

46
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,120
All of you are kind.

47
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,640
Excuse me.

48
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,680
Hello.

49
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,000
What do you plan to do next?

50
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,600
The real stone...

51
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,240
...should still be inside Victor's museum.

52
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,200
This museum has perfect security facilities.

53
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,520
If we want to take the stone, I'm afraid we need to have a plan.

54
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,480
I have heard about Victor.

55
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,320
He is famous in this area.

56
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,360
He and his wife,Yelena...

57
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,360
...have a huge social circle here.

58
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,520
You can't look down on their wealth and connections.

59
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,920
We will not gain any benefits from being forceful.

60
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,800
Just watch over it first.

61
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:52,720
There must be a loophole. When you find it,take action.

62
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,120
Do you still require me to help you with anything?

63
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,880
Other than the stone,...

64
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,200
...I still want a person.

65
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,360
Dead or alive?

66
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,760
No.

67
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,160
I'm sorry. -Do you have news?

68
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,000
From my investigation, your Uncle De...

69
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,240
...just met with Long Kun.

70
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,920
Long Kun is a famous antique businessman in Kiev.

71
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,880
He's connected with both sides of the law...

72
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,720
...and is also a competitor who poses risks to our business.

73
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,360
I have arranged my men by his side for business secrets.

74
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,360
From his report,Long Kun cleared his schedule for today...

75
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,040
...and went to an abandoned warehouse...

76
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,400
...to meet an old Asian man.

77
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,080
Besides, there's news from the museum.

78
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,800
Recently,there are some strangers who are watching nearby.

79
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,880
It seems that Uncle De has started to carry out this plan.

80
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,880
Is it better for us to move out the stone to be on the safe side?

81
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,340
I think it's better not to move the stone now.

82
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,000
They are looking for the opportunity to take it.

83
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,120
It's more dangerous when we move the stone.

84
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,520
That's right.

85
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,720
The security measures of the vault are tight.

86
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,250
They will not be able to take anything.

87
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,160
I'll place more people to secure the security system.

88
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,120
I'll go,too. -Zhuang Rui.

89
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,000
You're also their target. You have to be more careful.

90
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,159
I think it's better that you rest in Victor's house.

91
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,560
If you want to know the reason for my death,...

92
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,640
...come to Room 102 in George Hotel.

93
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,160
Gu Tianfeng. -No,it's impossible.

94
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,920
Grandfather Gu?

95
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,440
The phone number was hidden.

96
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,920
It should be sent by the murderer. -Uncle De.

97
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,050
It's extremely likely.

98
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,480
Xiaorui,this must be a trap. You must not go.

99
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,000
Mr. Victor,where is George Hotel?

100
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,640
At an intersection near Nevsky Prospekt.

101
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,680
How many routes to go to George Restaurant?

102
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,600
2 roads. Both are small alleys.

103
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,000
Nearest is a route which can be reached in 10 minutes.

104
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,150
No,you can't go. He may be the murderer. It's too dangerous!

105
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,610
Uncle De is unlikely to hurt me.

106
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,970
Xiaorui,what's the situation now? You still trust him.

107
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,120
If Uncle De wants to hurt me,...

108
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,860
...he will not wait until now.

109
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,620
You need to guarantee your safety. If not,you cannot go anywhere.

110
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,840
Maybe...

111
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,050
...this is a good opportunity to understand Uncle De's motive.

112
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,960
Then,let's hurry. We must quickly take action.

113
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,680
If you must go,Peng Fei and I will send you there.

114
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,120
Yelena,you'll be responsible for the restaurant. Can you?

115
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,160
Sure. -You can also order my followers.

116
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,720
There are suspicious people outside.

117
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,970
My house is also being watched now.

118
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,040
Come alone, or you will get nothing.

119
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,040
All of you wait for me near George Hotel.

120
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,620
I'll share my location to you.

121
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,720
I'll go alone.

122
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,090
At 9 o'clock direction.

123
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,090
At 1 o'clock direction.

124
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,680
This is bad. Zhuang Rui changed direction.

125
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,440
I'm sorry. The phone you called is switched off.

126
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,100
This is bad!

127
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,080
Okay,I have already arranged it.

128
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:51,920
Stop!

129
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,400
Boss says he wants him alive.

130
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,260
Xiaorui,are you alright?

131
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,880
Thank you. -Cunning people.

132
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,860
They purposely baited Feifei to attack you.

133
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,480
Luckily,Yelena's followers were able to arrive on time.

134
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,760
Who said Uncle De will not hurt you? Does your face hurt?

135
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:20,080
It's not Uncle De. They are Long Kun's followers.

136
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,560
Long Kun and Uncle De are working together.

137
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,810
Without Uncle De's order, why would Long Kun kidnap you?

138
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,980
Mr. Zhuang,...

139
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,440
...I'm afraid it's not safe here,either.

140
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,970
Long Kun's followers are outside the house and near the museum.

141
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,720
We're not in China. There are many things which we cannot do.

142
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,420
Xiaorui,why don't we put Uncle De's issue aside first?

143
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,420
No way. -Don't risk your life.

144
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,320
No.

145
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,320
I cannot let the stone be taken away.

146
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,440
Why so stubborn? Which is more important,the stone or your life?

147
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,170
Don't you know the difference?

148
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,480
Uncle De hurt my grandfather and Grandfather Gu.

149
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,360
I cannot let this be.

150
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,000
Don't worry,everyone. Peng Fei and I...

151
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,120
...will protect Zhuang Rui.

152
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,760
If so,Mr. Zhuang,I can only move you to another place.

153
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,400
Don't show up during this time.

154
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,120
Don't worry about the museum.

155
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,400
I have increased the guards. The stone is safe.

156
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,120
Thank you,Mr. Victor.

157
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,320
You're very kind.

158
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,680
You disappointed me.

159
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,080
It's quite difficult to want to arrest someone alive...

160
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,569
...within the territory of...

161
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,760
...Yelena and Victor.

162
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,380
It's just an antique businessman. You're a coward.

163
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,829
Why would I be afraid? -It's fine.

164
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,800
Just continue to watch Victor.

165
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:21,520
I'll do the rest.

166
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,600
It's secluded here. Long Kun's men will not find this place.

167
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,880
Please sit.

168
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,570
You aren't feeling well again.

169
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,090
Here,hurry and take the medicine.

170
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,480
I'm fine. Where's the stone?

171
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,260
Why are you still thinking about the stone now? Hurry and rest.

172
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,290
I'm really fine.

173
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,720
I still cannot accept...

174
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,440
...the truth that Uncle De is the murderer.

175
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,600
He is my friend and also my teacher.

176
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,340
He is someone I respected the most...

177
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,600
...and also someone who I aspire to become.

178
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,580
I never thought that.....

179
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,140
I really never thought that.....

180
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,720
It may be due to the Golden Eyes. The Golden Eyes...

181
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,640
...is the root of all evil. -Zhuang Rui,...

182
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,280
...don't try to find reason for the bad guy.

183
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,090
The Golden Eyes is not the root of all evil.

184
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,360
It's the greed in human.

185
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,680
That's right. Look,I love money too.

186
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,320
However,I will not do bad things because of money.

187
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,240
Don't worry, no matter what happens,...

188
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,660
...I'll always be by your side. -Me,too.

189
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,600
Me,too. -There's me,too.

190
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,840
Miss Xiaojia calls.

191
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,280
Miss Xiaojia. -Dear.

192
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,640
Why do you call me?

193
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,200
You haven't sent me a message all day long. How are you all?

194
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,920
I'm telling you, it was thrilling today!

195
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,760
Xiaorui was almost kidnapped. Luckily,I protected him.

196
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,120
It's all us. Well,everyone was there.

197
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,280
I still have to acknowledge their contributions.

198
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,540
Who was the one that actually protected him?

199
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,000
Feifei, why are you eavesdropping?

200
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,650
You're so loud. I don't need to listen.

201
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,260
No,don't leave. Feifei,how can you do this?

202
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,640
Breakfast is here.

203
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,890
This is a lot. -What is this?

204
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,000
What are you looking at? Eat up.

205
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,080
Here,eat more. -Kojima!

206
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,800
I brought food for you all. -That's great.

207
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,320
I'm afraid you aren't used to the food here. So,I prepared bento.

208
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,720
What is this? -It's nothing.

209
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,880
Don't be picky. Try it. -Eat more.

210
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,880
Eat more.

211
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,520
She is presentable and can cook.

212
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,620
I think I'll eat bread.

213
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,400
I prefer bread.

214
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,840
Me,too.

215
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,020
Sir,those outside the museum have left.

216
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,880
Zhuang Rui,I'm Victor.

217
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,720
Sure,be careful.

218
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,840
Victor said that Long Kun's followers have left the museum.

219
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,900
All of a sudden?

220
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,250
They should have another plan.

221
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,960
No matter what it is, the museum's security...

222
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,420
...must be strengthened.

223
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,720
Xiaofei,if you are fine, why don't you go to help Victor?

224
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,200
I have to ensure your safety. -I'm fine.

225
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,960
Long Kun's followers will not be able to find here for now.

226
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,280
Their sudden departure may be due to of another plan.

227
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,640
No matter what it is, the stone must not be lost.

228
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,280
Peng Fei,just go. It's enough with me here.

229
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,120
I can stay here with Mr. Zhuang. It's Mr. Nakagawa's order.

230
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,320
Thank you and Mr. Nakagawa.

231
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,520
Say something. -Xiaofei,...

232
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,580
...if there's nothing, you can go first.

233
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,040
You follow me.

234
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,560
I want to accompany Xiaorui.

235
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,000
You follow me. I'm afraid if anything happens here,...

236
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,560
...you will create troubles. -I create troubles? I.....

237
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,960
Why did you send my followers away?

238
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,160
Don't worry,A'Kun. I have my own plan.

239
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,040
I have sent them to watch for 2 days.

240
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:17,040
An opportunity is coming up soon. You ask them to leave like that.

241
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,120
What do you mean? -You have watched for 2 days.

242
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:25,200
You didn't kidnap him and made them hide instead.

243
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,360
Now,the museum's security is so strong...

244
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,280
...that even a fly cannot enter.

245
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,120
If you don't ask them back, won't you look stupid?

246
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,720
I'm telling you, when hunting,...

247
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,520
...you must be careful and have patience.

248
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,580
It's getting cold. -It's quite cold.

249
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,170
Wear more layers next time.

250
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,560
That's the Japanese.

251
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,400
Who is it? -It's me,Kojima.

252
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,290
Our location is revealed. -Why are they here so soon?

253
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,340
Could it be that someone revealed our location?

254
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,480
Yelena is able to plant spies at Long Kun's.

255
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,890
Then Long Kun...

256
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,220
...can also arrange spies in the museum.

257
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,690
Whatever it is, we must move immediately.

258
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,320
Why don't we find Peng Fei? -Wait.

259
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,960
Something's going on. Follow them.

260
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,580
We work well together.

261
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,280
Bring him away. -Zhuang Rui!

262
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,640
Didn't they want to meet us? Why are they not here yet?

263
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,160
Wait some more.

264
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:49,800
Zhuang Rui.

265
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,200
We meet again.

266
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,400
Young people are too impulsive. What's the rush?

267
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,080
We have not met for a long time. Sit there nicely.

268
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,360
Let's talk and drink some tea.

269
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,600
Why?

270
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,200
I keep telling myself...

271
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,680
...that you are not the murderer. It's not you.

272
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,040
Why?

273
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,840
It's your plan...

274
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,840
...when you blocked me...

275
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,340
...from Qin Haoran's gun.

276
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,400
Qin Haoran.

277
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,160
He is too stupid. What to do?

278
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,720
Qin Haoran,if you want to hurt Zhuang Rui,...

279
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,840
...you have to kill me.

280
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,450
Do you think I dare not kill you?

281
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,880
The worst is we all die together.

282
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,200
You purposely annoyed him so that he opened fire.

283
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,280
How could he pull the trigger in front of the police?

284
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,120
Besides, he is a threat to me when alive.

285
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,320
I have always respected you as my senior and a role model.

286
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,260
Never thought that you are such a person.

287
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,800
A murderer with blood on his hands.

288
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,320
Do I not have high hopes for you too?

289
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,400
I have always treated you like my only successor.

290
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,520
In the end,the youngsters are not to be taught.

291
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,640
Such a pity.

292
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,120
It's a pity that you have this pair of all-seeing eyes.

293
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,000
You cannot even see the evidence in front of you.

294
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,230
What to do?

295
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,560
Why do you do this?

296
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,000
You know Gu Tianfeng. He was a little noisy.

297
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:28,230
He liked to do inappropriate things. So,what can I do?

298
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,230
Initially,I thought that those who knew had died.

299
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,360
Never expected that Gu Tianfeng was alive.

300
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:47,920
All these while,he was actually able to find clues...

301
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,320
...and contacted Nakagawa Ryosuke.

302
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,600
Tell me,what should I do?

303
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,500
It's also my fault for not being careful.

304
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,160
Zhuang Qiming left some clues inside his letter.

305
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,760
If not, he might not have been dead.

306
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,640
At least,he was...

307
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,520
...a capable person.

308
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,120
If not,tell me, what should I do?

309
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,820
If he didn't die, I will be in trouble,child.

310
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,400
He should be grateful in this lifetime.

311
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,800
If Zhuang Qiming hadn't gone to Gansu on behalf him,...

312
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,480
...he would have died earlier. Don't be upset.

313
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,780
Xiaorui was taken away by Long Kun's followers.

314
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,980
Do you know where he is?

315
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,880
Where is Kojima? -Kojima is also missing.

316
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,160
She may be...

317
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,660
...taken away together with Zhuang Rui.

318
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,120
Rest first.

319
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,320
When we found you, you had fainted in the alley.

320
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,460
It's my fault for not protecting Zhuang Rui.

321
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,720
Don't blame yourself. It's good that you're safe.

322
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,280
The most important thing now...

323
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,140
...is to find a way to save Xiaorui and Kojima Akiko.

324
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,240
I'm going now. -I'll go,too.

325
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,120
Calm down,all of you.

326
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,060
We don't know the whereabouts of Zhuang Rui and Kojima.

327
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,660
How can we rescue them?

328
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,560
Besides, Long Kun is influential.

329
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,520
Even if you two are strong,...

330
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,770
...it's not a good idea to fight against many people.

331
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,060
Zhuang Rui's position is unique.

332
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,040
He is unlikely to be in danger. We still have time.

333
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,280
The important thing is to move the stone to a safe place.

334
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,600
Mr. Nakagawa, what's the situation now?

335
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,860
Lives are at risk but you worry about that stone.

336
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,400
Is that stone more important than Xiaorui and Kojima?

337
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,320
Mr. Peng, if we lose the stone,...

338
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,410
...we will lose the last chance to negotiate.

339
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,200
If need be,...

340
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,960
...we can use the stone to exchange for their lives.

341
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,000
Nakagawa is right.

342
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,840
As long as the stone is with us,...

343
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,920
...they will not hurt Mr. Zhuang and Kojima.

344
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,890
Don't worry,everyone.

345
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,600
I'll find out where Mr. Zhuang is taken to.

346
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,440
What do you think makes you successful today?

347
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,080
Is it hard work? Is it a skill?

348
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,560
No,it's none of these. It's that Golden Eyes.

349
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,660
The Golden Eyes changed your life...

350
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,240
...and changed everyone related to it.

351
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,060
It naturally includes me.

352
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,160
We're different people.

353
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:18,080
Yes. We're different people. I'm a fatherless child.

354
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,520
After my mother remarried, she dumped me.

355
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,000
I tell you,it's extremely difficult to survive...

356
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,080
...back then.

357
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,700
You wouldn't understand.

358
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,520
Do you know how it feels...

359
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,720
...to starve?

360
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:39,960
Do you know how it feels like to be looked down by others?

361
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,680
That's the bottom rung in life. I was born into it.

362
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,160
I don't even dare to think of being successful.

363
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,560
Unless there's an opportunity.

364
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,160
If there's really an opportunity, I will hold onto it with my life.

365
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:07,960
...an archaeological team came to our village.

366
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,160
The guide was a fat man.

367
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,880
Everyone wanted to be chosen.

368
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,880
Zhuang Qiming was kind and chose me to be the guide.

369
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,280
Fine. Then,I brought the team to Feng Quan's Tomb.

370
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,440
Then,what happened inside Feng Quan's Tomb...

371
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,680
...changed my life.
