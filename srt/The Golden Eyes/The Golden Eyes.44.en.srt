1
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,000
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 44

3
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,120
A'Lai.

4
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,200
Father,you're back. How is everything?

5
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,480
Prepare some water for everyone to wash up.

6
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,360
Sure.

7
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,440
Is there any water?

8
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,640
Over here.

9
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,760
The terrains here are complicated and it's difficult to search.

10
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,280
Luckily,we brought a lot of people this time.

11
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,740
We can search separately.

12
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,940
Then,we will have a bigger chance of finding it.

13
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,880
We have to examine this map.

14
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,920
Could it be here,Miss?

15
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,920
What a letdown! It's an adventure...

16
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,530
...and this popped up suddenly and we failed.

17
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,400
Was the Qin family bandits in their previous life?

18
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,520
They are bandits.

19
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,080
They took whatever we had.

20
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,160
Couldn't they be more creative?

21
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,160
Luckily,we came out of the cave safely.

22
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,280
That's right.

23
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,280
Luckily,Xiao Rui is fine. We can figure out others in the future.

24
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:21,810
What is there to figure out? We don't have the map.

25
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,640
Nevermind. The map was taken. Xiao Rui is quite upset.

26
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,240
When you go in later, don't pull a long face.

27
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,250
Give him some positive energy.

28
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,490
Let's go.

29
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,200
Let's rest for a while first.

30
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,080
We can think about other stuff tomorrow.

31
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,040
Hamu Basin is in the north...

32
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,930
...and Qinglong Mountain is in the south.

33
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,960
Aoyu City is in north-east and Liujin Town is in south-east.

34
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,880
To the east of Liujin Town is Kasamu Oasis.

35
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,480
In the middle is Sangmu'Er Canyon.

36
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,000
In the west are desert and poplar forest.

37
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,170
What is this?

38
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,040
A map?

39
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,960
Was it the one taken from the cave?

40
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,960
That's great. We were talking about what to do earlier on.

41
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,090
You even drew it out.

42
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,120
What is it,Xiao Rui? Are you having headache again?

43
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,760
Stop drawing. Just rest for a while.

44
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,920
No. I must draw it...

45
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,250
...while I still remember it or I will forget after I wake up.

46
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,760
That's right. Besides,...

47
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,160
...the Qin family obtained the map earlier than us.

48
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,240
They may have already departed by now.

49
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,760
If we have the map now,we still have time to go to Feng Quan Tomb.

50
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,360
They have more time to spare than us. We have to do it now.

51
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,159
We can leave after I pack. -There's no hurry.

52
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,930
The map covers a large area.

53
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,090
We are not able to confirm the whereabouts of Feng Quan Tomb.

54
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,820
I can only draw a rough sketch.

55
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:51,080
Aoyu City.

56
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,280
Kasa..... What are these places?

57
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,040
Look,this is our current position.

58
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,920
From the map,there are basins and valleys from north to south,...

59
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,920
...desert and poplar forest from east to west.

60
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,600
The terrain is too complicated.

61
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,060
It's difficult to search.

62
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,200
Besides,we don't have any clues on where Feng Quan Tomb is.

63
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,640
This means even if we have this map,...

64
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,409
...chances are slim for us.

65
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,980
That's not necessarily true.

66
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,010
How is the progress?

67
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,160
We have successfully entered the cave,...

68
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,440
...but we were ambushed by the Qin family.

69
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,720
The map of Feng Quan Tomb was taken away.

70
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,280
How is Zhuang Rui?

71
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,320
He is not well. He fainted when we left the cave.

72
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,800
However,after he woke up,he drew the map from his memories.

73
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,530
We're preparing to move again.

74
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,240
Protect Zhuang Rui. Report to me if there's anything.

75
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,520
Understood.

76
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,440
I have marked...

77
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,000
...four possible locations of Feng Quan Tomb on the map.

78
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,060
Send two teams to search separately.

79
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,000
Understood. -We are now at this location.

80
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,040
Liujin Town. To the north is Aoyu City.

81
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,920
Send someone to examine here thoroughly.

82
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,860
It's the most prosperous area. Perhaps Feng Quan Tomb is here.

83
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,530
Apart from that,...

84
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,440
...send another team over here.

85
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,240
Kasamu Desert.

86
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,760
There's a place called Kubuqi there.

87
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,930
It's very close to Liujin Town.

88
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,250
It is more likely that Feng Quan Tomb is in this place.

89
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,530
Understood.

90
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,520
If there's nothing in these two places,...

91
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,060
...both the teams must immediately go to Hamu Basin...

92
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,680
...and Sangmu'er Canyon. -Okay.

93
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,400
I'll send people over there now.

94
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:29,880
Wait.

95
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,650
If you still can't find it in these places,...

96
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,890
...then you can only search towards the west.

97
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,920
Miss,we seem to have forgotten a place.

98
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,640
Lao Zeng Inn.

99
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,320
Zhuang Rui and others have lost the map. They must have plans.

100
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,960
This is an opportunity for us.

101
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,120
No. Our goal is to find Feng Quan Tomb.

102
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,660
Other than that,any action will be irrelevant.

103
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,580
Miss,Zhuang Rui..... -Please focus on the main point.

104
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,000
Miss,Zhuang Rui is too cunning.

105
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,600
It's the perfect time to kill them now to prevent...

106
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,200
...any untoward incident. -Don't you understand my words?

107
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,440
Hurry up and move.

108
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,640
Mr. Feng!

109
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,900
I had searched for you.

110
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,370
Mr. Feng,is your hand getting better?

111
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,920
The doctor says it will heal after half a month.

112
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,650
Don't worry.

113
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,320
Mr. Zhuang,when I came over here to look for you,...

114
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,960
...you went to the desert.

115
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,370
Did everything go well?

116
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,420
Good things require effort. We still need to work hard.

117
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,770
Right,I heard from A'Lai that you have something to give me.

118
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,320
I have something to ask you.

119
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,760
You came to the factory to save me that day.

120
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,560
I asked you how you knew there's a Feng character in the Sancai.

121
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,720
Was it true that you were lucky?

122
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:38,280
Actually,when I was in Gui City, I knocked down a Sancai.

123
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,560
I saw this character on it.

124
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,160
We inherited this jade from our ancestors.

125
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,720
It's been our family treasure for over 1,000 years.

126
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,500
It's the Feng family's most prized possession.

127
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,600
However,I don't know whether I should believe it.

128
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,000
What do you think,Mr. Zhuang?

129
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,740
Mr. Zhuang.

130
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,420
Mr. Zhuang!

131
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,820
Like you've said,this is indeed a priceless treasure.

132
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,680
It seems that you can see many things which I don't see.

133
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,080
Mr. Feng. This is left by Feng Quan.

134
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,940
You said that it's your family treasure.

135
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,880
So,you are a descendant of Feng Quan.

136
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,920
It seems that you also know Feng Quan.

137
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,800
I'd made the right decision to come here today.

138
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,720
You're the one we have been waiting for generations.

139
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,560
Along with the inheritance of this jade,there's a piece of advice.

140
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,720
Whoever that has the same vision power as Feng Quan...

141
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,480
...and is capable of identifying the value of the jade...

142
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,000
...will be its real owner.

143
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,880
Now it belongs to you.

144
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,080
This.....

145
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,680
This is too much of a coincidence.

146
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,000
I don't believe it initially. I thought it got passed down...

147
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,060
...and may fall into the wrong hands.

148
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,000
How can there be such a person in this world?

149
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,720
Well,I couldn't simply throw away what's left by my ancestors.

150
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,480
Now I finally believe...

151
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,250
...that such a person truly exists in this world.

152
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,160
Feng Quan was indeed an unusual person.

153
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,480
His story and experiences sounded like a fairytale.

154
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,400
You have helped me a lot by giving me this jade.

155
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,560
Thank you. You're very kind.

156
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,800
You're welcome. It is our honour.

157
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,720
I have finally met the legendary man...

158
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,200
...whom my ancestors failed to find then.

159
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,240
We're destined to meet.

160
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,760
You're right. It's indeed fated.

161
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,200
By the way,Mr. Feng,what are the other stories...

162
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,440
...about Feng Quan?

163
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,200
I know very little about this person.

164
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,960
If not because of you, I would have...

165
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,090
...forgotten about this jade.

166
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,240
The mystery left by my ancestors...

167
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,960
...will have to be solved by you.

168
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,640
I'll make a move first.

169
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,880
Eat more.

170
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,880
I know.

171
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,700
I know Feng Quan Tomb's location.

172
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,120
Miss.

173
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,320
We received news that our men found nothing in Hamu Basin.

174
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,840
On top of the current Qinglong Valley,...

175
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,440
...there's nothing in the four possible locations...

176
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,640
...of Feng Quan Tomb.

177
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,320
Continue to go to the front. Search further.

178
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,080
Okay.

179
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:46,920
Get ready!

180
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,040
Hello,Jia.

181
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,280
Fei Fei,how is your progress? Do you miss me?

182
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,920
I really miss you,Ms. Xiao Jia.

183
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,200
The natural landscape here is very beautiful.

184
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,160
There's a desert inside Gobi and an oasis in the desert.

185
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,960
Although there aren't many people,it's very majestic.

186
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,760
If I have the chance,I must bring you here to experience it.

187
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,560
Why is it you? Where is Fei Fei?

188
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,120
She is not important. -What are you talking about?

189
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,280
Ms. Xiao Jia,...

190
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,760
...I haven't heard your lovely voice for a long time.

191
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,680
Why do you call me suddenly?

192
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,920
Who is calling you? I'm just worried about Xiao Rui's health.

193
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,260
I'm here. What are you worried about?

194
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,520
I'm very smart. I'll certainly protect everyone.

195
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,240
With your body size, if you're in danger,...

196
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,120
...it's difficult for you to even save yourself.

197
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,560
That's impossible. Ms. Xiao Jia, I'm responsible...

198
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:22,000
...for the journey, the people and the resources.

199
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,640
Ms. Xiao Jia,what happened to you? Are you all right?

200
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,840
Fine,that's enough. -I'll lead them back triumphantly!

201
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,090
I'll call you later.

202
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,700
Huangfu Yun,you're really thick-skinned.

203
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,880
How dare you claim to be the main person-in-charge.

204
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,440
I'm saying that so that Ms. Xiao Jia can rest easy.

205
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,160
Besides,I have to be strong in front of Ms. Xiao Jia.

206
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,800
I have to portray myself as strong.

207
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,240
I need to do that so that she'll marry me.

208
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,600
You...

209
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,700
...boast too much.

210
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,740
Actually,it's good. Ms. Xiao Jia will be less worried.

211
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,290
She's been worried these few days.

212
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,720
At least,the situation is stable now.

213
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,880
We also have a direction.

214
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,800
We were still worried yesterday...

215
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,540
...but we are on our way today.

216
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,600
Xiao Rui, I think you are capable.

217
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,620
I'll give you a 'like'.

218
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,040
Use your magical eyes to look at my passionate red heart.

219
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,440
Don't give me a 'like'. Praise Feng Quan instead.

220
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,320
He was brilliant.

221
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,620
There's a whole wide world behind a small piece of jade.

222
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,120
It's really strange. I've examined it thoroughly.

223
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,160
There's nothing unusual. It's just a normal jade.

224
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,120
All right. We might be able to reach Feng Quan Tomb...

225
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,800
...before the Qin family does. -That's right.

226
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,720
The fools will be all confused now.

227
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,580
They may be wandering somewhere.

228
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,120
It's useless for them to plot anything against us now.

229
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,240
Brother Gui,they're in the poplar forest. Cars can't get through.

230
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,720
Do I still need to follow them?

231
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,840
Go on. -Okay.

232
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,480
Miss,drink some water.

233
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,080
They are here.

234
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,400
They are already moving.

235
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,440
Zhuang Rui and three others are heading here in a car.

236
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,600
We guessed right.

237
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,320
This big canyon is the only place we have yet to search.

238
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,480
We spent many days to get here.

239
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,560
How did they find the place so easily?

240
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,640
I suspect Zhuang Rui and others have found new clues.

241
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,320
Miss,how about this?

242
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,920
We will follow them to where we want to go.

243
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,240
Is it possible?

244
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,060
Send people to follow them. -Yes.

245
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,920
How much further?

246
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,280
They are in the canyon. Cars will draw unwanted attention.

247
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,940
Do I still need to follow them?

248
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,360
You might be exposed. You may leave.

249
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:57,880
Yes.

250
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,120
Miss,look.

251
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,920
Are you certain? -Yes,look.

252
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,680
He's holding a map.

253
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,160
However,Zhuang Rui is very cunning.

254
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,620
Is it possible that he is tricking us?

255
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,560
Miss,...

256
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,520
...I'll bring people to kill him now and take the map.

257
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,880
There's no need for that.

258
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,240
They will be alerted if you go now.

259
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,880
Miss,that won't happen.

260
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,980
No. Just send people to watch Zhuang Rui and follow him....

261
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,560
...to find Feng Quan Tomb.

262
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,210
Why do you need to kill them?

263
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,360
Miss,we can let him live. Let's tie him up...

264
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,360
...so that he will not create trouble for us in the future.

265
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,120
Miss,if you have any concern,I'll do it.

266
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,000
What do you want to do? I know what to do.

267
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,980
I don't need you to boss me around.

268
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,720
It's really bad now.

269
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,250
Miss. -I have stomach ache last night.

270
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,760
Was it what you ate? -I starve at the sight of food.

271
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,460
I think you like the cricket more.

272
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,960
How about this? I'll give you this cricket.

273
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,600
I never knew that...

274
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,660
...others might need me,too.

275
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,650
I never knew that...

276
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,160
...I'm capable of helping someone.

277
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,700
I've never suspected you before.

278
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,360
I've always believed in you.

279
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,520
You befriended me in order to use me...

280
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,940
...to obtain the jade.

281
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,440
Am I right?

282
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:38,600
Miss.

283
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,920
Boss said that the temperature in the desert changes drastically.

284
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,050
You have to take good care of yourself.

285
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,720
Drink some ginger tea and rest early.

286
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,600
Get the map.

287
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,850
Zhuang Rui's life doesn't matter.

288
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,320
Go. -Yes.

289
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,360
What do you want to do?

290
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,490
Miss,...

291
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,560
...I thought you'd sleep a little longer thanks to the ginger tea.

292
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,720
I didn't mean to disturb you.

293
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,180
As for what I want to do,...

294
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,520
...I'm going to do something you should have done earlier.

295
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,410
You aren't allowed to hurt Zhuang Rui.

296
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,360
Who doesn't allow it? Do you?

297
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,410
If not because of you,Zhuang Rui would have died a long time ago!

298
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,240
Miss,when I obtain the map,...

299
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,250
...I shall apologise to you again.

300
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,920
Brother Gui,we are in position.

301
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,240
Are you ready?

302
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,000
Yes.

303
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,680
If you dare to lay a finger on Zhuang Rui,I won't forgive you.

304
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,920
Action. -Don't!

305
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,120
Brother Gui. -Zhuang Rui!

306
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,280
One died and another was hurt. The others ran away.

307
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,480
It's all right,as long as we have Zhuang Rui.

308
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,000
It's an impostor!

309
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,850
Bring him away! If the impostor is here,the real deal...

310
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,480
...won't get to escape. Let's go! -Yes.

311
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,480
I knew Zhuang Rui wouldn't have been caught so easily.

312
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,840
Go straight from here and we'll soon arrive at the destination.

313
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,840
At our speed,we will find the cave before morning.

314
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
We're quite lucky. We didn't bump into the Qin family.

315
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,320
It seems that our plan is effective.

316
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,210
Starting from now, we'll act separately.

317
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,880
The four of us will move around the canyon...

318
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,040
...to attract the Qin family's attention...

319
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,720
...and buy time.

320
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,850
You'll head straight to the cave in the west from outside...

321
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,800
...to search for Feng Quan Tomb.

322
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,200
The Qin family is prepared. It's too dangerous to show up...

323
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,680
...in their monitored area.

324
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,740
I suggest for us to distract the Qin family while you...

325
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,760
...search for Feng Quan Tomb. -No,if they attack you,...

326
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,090
...you'll be in danger.

327
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,900
Feng Quan Tomb is very unique.

328
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,440
We know nothing about its location and inner structure.

329
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,480
Only Zhuang Rui can do this.

330
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,040
We are confident in distracting them...

331
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,880
...and buying more time for you.

332
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,260
Don't worry. We'll maintain a safe distance...

333
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,210
...and arrive at the gathering point on time.

334
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,000
Be careful.

335
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,280
We will go there.

336
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,250
I hope Xiao Dao and others are fine.

337
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,080
They're great fighters. I think they can handle it.

338
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,800
They will be safe.

339
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,600
Let's go.

340
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,960
Listen. We're going to act separately now.

341
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,780
I'm going to inform Zhuang Rui. You must keep them here.

342
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,240
Okay.

343
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,540
Be careful. -Okay.

344
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,040
Okay. Be careful.

345
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,320
Let's go.

346
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,200
I'm having stomach ache. -Miss,how are you?

347
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,280
It's here.

348
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,400
Here?

349
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,260
Is this Feng Quan Tomb?

350
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,280
Isn't this a sundial?

351
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,880
There's no one here. What's the sundial for?

352
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,520
This looks like a sundial but it's not.

353
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,500
It has an extra needle compared to a sundial.

354
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,800
This sundial may contain the secret of Feng Quan Tomb.

355
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,840
Was Feng Quan a teacher?

356
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,179
He even left an equation here.

357
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,090
It seems that it's pointless to move this needle.

358
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,860
It's not pointless. He's doing it wrong.

359
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,360
How should I do it?

360
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,080
Look.

361
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,160
What? -Feng yi wei xiang.

362
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,780
This is Small Seal Script, the calligraphy of Qin dynasty.

363
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,800
You're a history graduate. Translate it for us.

364
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,000
What's written here?

365
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,680
Feng yi wei xiang.

366
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,320
He yi shi zhi.

367
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,800
...ming ming an an, wei shi he wei.

368
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,600
Feng Quan didn't just leave an equation.

369
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,480
He left us a comprehension of ancient text.

370
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,840
It's Qu Yuan's Heavenly Questions, part of Chu Ci.

371
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,160
It may be the answer to this sundial.

372
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,240
It roughly talked about how the universe was formed,...

373
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,650
...how to differentiate light and darkness,...

374
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,930
...how the light in the day and the darkness at night came about.

375
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,130
What does this have to do with the sundial?

376
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,120
Sundial represents time. We should be asking this instead.

377
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,380
What's the relationship between these words and the time?

378
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,040
There are 12 hours of day and 12 hours of night.

379
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,930
In other words, day and night are similar.

380
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,970
When you add both the day and night,...

381
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,380
...doesn't it mean the whole day?

382
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,040
A day means 24 hours.

383
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,960
It is a day.

384
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,780
This is the answer.

385
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:41,720
It's open.

386
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,600
What a strange mechanism. So the folks in Qin dynasty were clever.

387
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,960
What are you talking about?

388
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,480
It's our intelligence combined.

389
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,370
Let's go.

390
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,780
Zhuang Rui!

391
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,200
Boss,we got the information. We are leaving now.

392
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,340
There will not be any problem.

393
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,600
Brother Gui! -What is it?

394
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,160
Brother Gui,I was ambushed and Miss escaped.

395
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,800
What? She must have informed Zhuang Rui.

396
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,640
Let's leave now. Let's go!

397
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,280
You're quick.

398
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,320
You're alone. Where are your people?

399
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,560
Don't get me wrong. I don't want to hurt you.

400
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,370
Why are you here?

401
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,040
I want to tell you that your plan was exposed.

402
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,640
Your impostor was shot and caught. Brother Gui and others are coming.

403
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,560
You should go. -What? Someone was caught?

404
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,280
Someone posed as me? What do you mean?

405
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,760
Maybe Xiao Dao's followers wanted to distract them.

406
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,760
So they got their people to pretend to be us.

407
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,520
Yes. -They're shot and captured?

408
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,200
Are they in danger? How many were caught?

409
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,010
He alone was caught.

410
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,300
Brother Gui and others are on their way here. You should go.

411
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,720
Stop pretending. Isn't Brother Gui your follower?

412
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,330
Why didn't he come with you?

413
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,760
Brother Gui disobeyed me...

414
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,120
...and even held me captive. I escaped.

415
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,680
Why did he do that?

416
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,800
Brother Gui has wanted to kill you along this journey.

417
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,930
I kept stopping him.

418
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,960
He caught the impostor yesterday and drugged my drink.

419
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:59,040
After I slept,he tortured that guy...

420
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,410
...and found out about your location.

421
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,520
Even so,why are you informing us?

422
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,800
You kept following us and took the map in the cave.

423
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,960
You wanted to be the first to find the tomb,no?

424
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,370
I want to find Feng Quan Tomb...

425
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,120
...to complete the task my father assigned me.

426
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,680
I never intend to hurt you,...

427
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,050
...especially Zhuang Rui.

428
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,040
Trust me,I came here to save you.

429
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,380
You have lied to me many times in the past.

430
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,060
Why should I trust you?

431
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,290
Xiao Dao. -She is not lying.

432
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,340
Ms. Qin was telling the truth.

433
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,700
A'Bu was captured.

434
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,160
Brother Gui will come here soon. We are in danger now.

435
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,250
Are you all right,Xiao Dao?

436
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,880
It's nothing. Qingshan has returned to save them.

437
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,560
Brother Gui have many followers and they're armed.

438
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,200
We must leave immediately.

439
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,680
What are we waiting for? -Wait.

440
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,040
Brother Gui won't arrive right away.

441
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,100
We have to hurry up.

442
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,560
We may be able to find the tomb.

443
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,560
It's all right. It doesn't matter even if they're here.

444
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,320
I'm here.

445
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,000
Me,too.

446
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,160
I'm representing Mr. Nakagawa to protect you...

447
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,960
...and ensure your safely.

448
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,960
Your injury..... -Don't worry,this is nothing.

449
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,800
Okay,let's go.

450
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,160
Ms. Qin,don't think of entering.

451
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,200
If you are injured, your father will be worried.

452
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,040
I did this behind Brother Gui.

453
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,890
With the current situation, I cannot go back now.

454
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,120
Ms. Miao. I want to follow you to enter it.

455
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,840
If you hurt Zhuang Rui,...

456
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,680
...I won't spare you. -I won't hurt him.

457
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,840
I would never do that.
