1
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,500
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,500
Episode 18

3
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,120
The ball starting soon. Let's get changed.

4
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,240
It's a great place!

5
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,850
Xiaofei,let's have a look.

6
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,960
You're not worried this time?

7
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,880
We haven't attended a ball before.

8
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:15,730
Let's go!

9
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:18,780
Feifei.

10
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:21,960
Well.....

11
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,600
How's your wound?

12
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,360
It's good now.

13
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,520
It's good now.

14
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,560
Look at you. Now that you're in a suit,...

15
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,890
...you look like a high-class bodyguard.

16
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,520
Want a taste of this high-class bodyguard's punch?

17
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,560
No thanks,Brother Fei.

18
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,040
What are we waiting for? Let's go! -Why isn't Feifei here yet?

19
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,720
She doesn't like being late.

20
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,440
You don't understand. Women like to make a grand entrance.

21
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,370
Why don't you wait here for Feifei?

22
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,680
I'm hungry. I'll go in for something to eat,okay?

23
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,440
Come on. Let's go,Xiaofei. -How many times have I said...

24
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,520
...not to call me Xiaofei? -All right.

25
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,480
Xiaofei,come on.

26
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,560
Hi.

27
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,800
Hi. Hello,where are you from? -I'm from Ukraine.

28
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,880
It's a beautiful place. You look great.

29
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,080
Can I.....

30
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,640
I.....

31
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,840
WeChat!

32
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,220
What are you doing? So many girls and you're eating!

33
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,240
I'm waiting for Feifei and Xiaorui.

34
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,240
What wait for them? Goodness! This is heaven,all right?

35
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,400
Okay,you eat on your own. I'm going to get busy.

36
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:55,880
Miss Miao.

37
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,170
What a coincidence.

38
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,160
Miss Miao,it must be your first time to a ball.

39
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,040
Your shoes seem a bit too small for your feet.

40
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,400
I don't think it's your size. It doesn't seem to fit.

41
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,080
Miss,may I have this dance with you?

42
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,000
Thank you.

43
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,680
Feifei.

44
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,560
Aren't you going in for a dance?

45
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,720
I don't like this.

46
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,920
If you don't like it, let's go for a walk outside.

47
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:22,890
Let's go.

48
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,700
What is this place?

49
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,720
This is a...

50
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,000
...a quiet place that's quite hard to find.

51
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,560
It's quite nice here. -Oh,yes.

52
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,570
You look very pretty...

53
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,100
...in this outfit.

54
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,880
This dress is ridiculous. The shoes are ridiculous,too.

55
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,440
The mask is ridiculous. Me coming here is a joke.

56
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,360
Back there, I looked ridiculous,too.

57
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,940
Weren't you enjoying yourself in there?

58
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,560
Hurry back in.

59
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,490
Have a dance and drive all the girls crazy.

60
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,080
Look at me,...

61
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,810
...do I still need to dance?

62
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,740
Then what do you want to do?

63
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:09,900
Feifei.

64
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,720
It's like this. I...

65
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,410
...would like to have a dance with you.

66
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,080
You didn't even ask me if I know how to dance.

67
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,140
Well,do you know how to dance?

68
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,050
I can try.

69
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,020
What are you doing?

70
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,440
I'm recording it. It's beautiful. -What are you guys doing here?

71
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,580
We've come to ask you to go back there.

72
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,450
That kind of a place is not suitable for me.

73
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,730
Did we interrupt anything?

74
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,680
Not at all.

75
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,440
I have to say,...

76
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,800
...not everyone is suited for a place like that,right?

77
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,160
However,look at us rich people.

78
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,480
I know it's not easy to act rich. Especially him,right?

79
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,880
As a civil police, an ex-civil police,...

80
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,860
...you've been to places, yet you're afraid of this place.

81
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,200
Huang Fuyun, take your clothes off.

82
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,300
What are you going to do? -Take your clothes off!

83
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,560
I look forward to our meeting again.

84
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,580
May I have a dance with you?

85
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,560
Zheng Hua?

86
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,330
I think it's best if you explain yourself.

87
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,720
It was only some fencing. What's wrong with that?

88
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,240
Does Zhuang Rui have to complain to you about this?

89
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,420
Zheng Hua,I hope you'll be clear about this.

90
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,000
Zhuang Rui is my father's guest.

91
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,130
So please be more respectful towards him.

92
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,720
I don't see what's the big deal.

93
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,650
Miss Qin,...

94
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,540
...may I have this dance with you?

95
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,440
Not bad. -Xiaofei,let's have a dance.

96
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,560
I told you,don't call me Xiaofei. -All right.

97
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,960
I won't call you that again. Okay,Xiaofei?

98
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,960
Look at you. Are you angry,Xiaofei?

99
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,000
Miss Qin,I'm honoured to have danced with you.

100
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,680
The perfume you're wearing is very unique.

101
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,920
Hello,Miss Xiaojia.

102
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,690
I haven't called you for days. Many things happened lately.

103
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,280
Yes,we went to that masquerade.

104
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,700
Well,at first Feifei wasn't keen on dancing at all.

105
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,520
Then she made me take my suit off.

106
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,600
Did you know? Feifei looked good in a suit.

107
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,960
She mesmerized everyone. -Are you done?

108
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,580
You're treading on thin ice. Feifei might just beat you up.

109
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,400
Anything the matter? -Does matters of the heart count?

110
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,060
Right,I'll hang up if there's nothing else.

111
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,800
Why did she hang up? -That was quick.

112
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,400
Love between two people needs to be nurtured.

113
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,210
Understand? The process of nurturing...

114
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,080
...has its highs and lows, which I really enjoy.

115
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,760
I'm going through the lows right now.

116
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,440
I believe there's going to be a new high.

117
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,960
By the way,are we really staying here for two days?

118
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,200
Isn't it a two-day ball? -Right. We are rich now.

119
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,680
Zheng Hua,long time no see.

120
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,920
We've been waiting for a year to play with the King of Gambling.

121
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,840
I can't wait to see you on the table.

122
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,280
So are you ready to lose?

123
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,080
cool

124
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,170
They're playing cards.

125
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,810
Huang Fuyun's in trouble. -What's wrong?

126
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,880
Come on, I'll tell you on the way.

127
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,130
He's in trouble? What trouble?

128
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,820
Over there.

129
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,940
The one sitting opposite Huang Fuyun is Stevenson.

130
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,520
He's the God of Gambling in three gambling cities.

131
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,880
Zheng Hua invited him over for a charity game.

132
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,460
All winnings will go to charity. -Continue.

133
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,520
Huang Fuyun has lost quite a bit.

134
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,800
Talk to him. Look at how red his eyes are.

135
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,760
It's impossible to persuade him unless someone helps him win.

136
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,960
Mr. Zhuang, interested in a game?

137
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,840
I'll take over from him. -Zhuang Rui.

138
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,080
Are you crazy? I asked you here to persuade him.

139
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,440
Don't make it worse. -You might as well try.

140
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,040
Do you know Texas Hold'em? -No,I'll learn it now.

141
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,280
Zhuang Rui. -Don't worry.

142
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,000
Miss Miao,you don't trust Zhuang Rui,do you?

143
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,140
I'll take over.

144
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,210
Tell me how to play this.

145
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,280
Texas Hold'em Poker has no original bet.

146
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,200
You don't even know the rules yet you want to be the hero?

147
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,060
This fellow sure is interesting.

148
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,080
It's just the two of us. How can we go on?

149
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,960
2 to 22 players can get involved in the Texas Hold'Em Poker.

150
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,960
Go on. -Listen here.

151
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,380
If we become penniless because of this,it's all on you.

152
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,050
Zhuang Rui is very confident. -He has the means to be confident.

153
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,360
UAH 2 million.

154
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,080
If she deals a "9" card, I still have a chance. Call.

155
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,080
You have it or you're bluffing? Right?

156
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,290
Both players have to show their cards.

157
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:03,970
Check it out.

158
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,820
What cards does Xiaorui have?

159
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,100
Looks like a change of players doesn't really help.

160
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,940
Zhuang Rui could still win...

161
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,410
...if his cards are a pair of nines.

162
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,200
Mr. Zhuang has the stronger cards. Mr. Zhuang wins.

163
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:41,080
Didn't you say a change of players doesn't help?

164
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,840
Just a stroke of luck. Nothing extraordinary.

165
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,400
That doesn't look like a stroke of luck. Could it be...

166
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,000
...that this fellow can see his opponent's cards?

167
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,340
Thank you. -Thank you.

168
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,640
What's the rush,Mr. Zhuang. -Mr. Zhuang,

169
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,960
You've had a brilliant showdown with Mr. Stevenson,...

170
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,820
...why don't you play more rounds? -You don't allow winners to leave?

171
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,160
It's not about winning or losing. It's all for charity anyway.

172
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,690
We shouldn't waste precious opportunities.

173
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,400
We can play again,if you want.

174
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:35,840
You first.

175
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,680
Zhuang Rui,are you okay?

176
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,080
Raise. -Call.

177
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,040
UAH 20 million.

178
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,090
He's purposely drawing me out.

179
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,440
For Mr. Zhuang,hand is flush.

180
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,480
Mr. Stevenson's hand is straight flush.

181
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,480
Mr. Stevenson wins.

182
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,840
Impossible.

183
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,720
So,you want to play another round?

184
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,380
You were cheating!

185
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,320
Mr. Zhuang, don't start throwing accusations.

186
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,160
That's so incredible. I never thought that...

187
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,440
...the King of Gambling would set his fame and integrity aside.

188
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,600
If you think you can slander me, you're going to pay.

189
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,840
How dare you?

190
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,540
Check the cards right now! -That's right,check the cards!

191
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,480
Enough. You're getting over-excited.

192
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,440
A misunderstanding. Game's over -No.

193
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,880
I want to see the cards now,too. Let's give the man what he wants.

194
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,880
Show us the cards.

195
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,410
Will such self-confidence bring about trouble?

196
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,720
He could actually see the hidden trump.

197
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,440
Zhuang Rui.

198
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,160
Your pair of eyes are a precious commodity.

199
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,920
It's the dealer. The dealer put that there.

200
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,480
Do not insult me or I'll make you pay.

201
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,800
Please don't worry. I'll get to the bottom of this.

202
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,440
Guards,take the dealer away!

203
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,080
Zhuang Rui,are you okay?

204
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,760
You know I value my reputation above all.

205
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,250
I had nothing to do with this. Nothing!

206
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,480
So I want to see the dealer.

207
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,680
She's been taken away. You just mind your own business.

208
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,360
I'll handle the rest.

209
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:33,240
You paid her,didn't you? You paid her! You used me!

210
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,960
Stevenson,calm down,okay?

211
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,930
It's just a small accident, all right?

212
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,340
You have to tell everyone.

213
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,520
Tell everyone it's all your fault! It's nothing to do with me!

214
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,160
Stevenson,don't push me. All right?

215
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,640
Okay. You know what?

216
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,080
I will tell everybody...

217
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,280
...that you're smuggling in antiquities. Yes,you know.

218
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,960
Everybody would know...

219
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,760
...that in your collection, there are smuggled objects.

220
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,400
Don't you dare threaten me.

221
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,120
As I told you, I value my reputation above all.

222
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,480
Are you feeling better? -What happened?

223
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,640
You fainted at the gambling hall.

224
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,000
You could've been mentally exhausted.

225
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,920
That's all,I think.

226
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,160
How did they resolve the cheating? -Zheng Hua...

227
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,480
...has taken Stevenson away. He said they'll investigate him.

228
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,610
However,nothing is happening so far.

229
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,200
Hello,everyone. I've come to take you down for a meal.

230
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,520
What happened? -I'm not sure.

231
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,530
I think there has been a murder.

232
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,520
That's awful.

233
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,040
You can't go in there. -Police.

234
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,280
This is Stevenson.

235
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,290
Livor mortis hasn't set in.

236
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,850
This must have happened less than an hour ago.

237
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,520
No drag marks on the floor.

238
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,960
This is the murder scene.

239
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,120
What happened?

240
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,610
How did this happen?

241
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,240
Stevenson died of a slash wound to his throat.

242
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,620
Hello,is this the police?

243
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,360
This is the Zheng Manor. There's been a murder.

244
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,680
All right.

245
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,400
A snowstorm sealed up the road. The police can't get here for now.

246
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,900
We need to seal the crime scene. -Hold on.

247
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,120
Didn't you take Stevenson away to be investigated?

248
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,020
How did he end up dead here?

249
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,800
He injured a guard and ran. We were looking for him.

250
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,820
I never imagined.....

251
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,360
Everyone,...

252
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,260
...I take full responsibility for what happened here.

253
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,760
I,Zheng Hua, guarantee with my life,...

254
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,020
...that from now on,nothing of the sort will happen again.

255
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,700
I hope everyone will cooperate with the police.

256
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,520
Please return to your rooms.

257
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:08,480
I will ensure that everyone is safe.

258
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,400
To avoid suspicions, let the police handle this.

259
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,680
What,so the guards are free from suspicion?

260
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,700
That's enough.

261
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,080
Just do as I say. Thank you.

262
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,000
Zhuang Rui had a beef with Stevenson.

263
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,660
He's the most suspicious one.

264
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,600
Xiaorui was with us all the time. I can be his witness.

265
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,480
You could be an accomplice.

266
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,560
Aren't there CCTVs here? Let's check them.

267
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:42,440
Let's not suspect each other. We'll wait for the police.

268
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,080
Please.

269
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,680
What happened?

270
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,760
Is Zhuang Rui..... -Stevenson is dead.

271
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,800
What?

272
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,200
Remain in your room until the police arrive.

273
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,520
I will protect you.

274
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,960
Mr. Zhuang,sorry about this. I will get to the bottom of this.

275
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,480
What's going on here?

276
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,710
Let me see. -Miss Miao.

277
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,880
You better not touch it before the police comes.

278
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,250
Someone deliberately put it in here.

279
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,230
The things is,the windows show no sign of a break-in.

280
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:48,090
How do we know it wasn't already here from the start?

281
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,400
We'd already gone through the room before check-in.

282
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,800
Besides,the blood on the knife is not completely dry.

283
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,680
So the stains were recent. There's also writing on it.

284
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,600
You guys are framing him. Rui was with us all along.

285
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,400
How could he have killed anyone?

286
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,720
The murderer's fingers...

287
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,600
...were slashed.

288
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,040
Mr. Zhuang,how do you know the murderer's fingers were slashed?

289
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,120
Did you see that at the murder scene?

290
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,320
Or perhaps,to avoid suspicion,...

291
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,490
...you're fabricating evidence?

292
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,440
If you say this,...

293
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,660
...I really would have to take you in.

294
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,020
Zhuang Rui is not going anywhere.

295
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,440
Don't get excited. We won't do anything to him.

296
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,520
However, with his situation now,...

297
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,760
...if we don't isolate him, others will not feel safe.

298
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,520
When the police arrives,...

299
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,080
...we will hand the evidence...

300
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,840
...and Mr. Zhuang to the police.

301
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,080
Mr. Zhuang will be proven innocent then.

302
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,200
Only if he can really prove himself innocent.

303
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,520
All right.

304
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,040
Zhuang Rui! -To avoid suspicion,...

305
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,840
...please don't leave your room. Let's go.

306
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,560
Don't worry.

307
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,240
It'll be fine.

308
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,560
What should we do?

309
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:21,840
Are you wearing gloves? -It's snowing. My hands are cold.

310
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,410
It's to hide something,right?

311
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,160
Just like hiding the dagger under the bed?

312
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,800
Is it really safe to hide it under the bed?

313
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,800
The truth will out when the police arrives.

314
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,280
Zhuang Rui sent me his location.

315
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,880
Please bear with this until the police arrives.

316
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,000
Please.

317
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,640
You have been discussing all day. What's the plan?

318
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,600
Plan A,trigger the fire alarm.

319
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,800
Let them open the doors and we'll escape.

320
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,320
That won't work. What's plan B?

321
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,680
The balcony. -The balcony?

322
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,460
The storeroom is next door. We'll climb over from the balcony.

323
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,600
I brought some food for you.
