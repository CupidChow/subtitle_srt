1
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:35,500
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,500
Episode 9

3
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,360
Now I have my grandson and god-grandson here.

4
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:43,210
Let's drink to celebrate this.

5
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,960
Uncle Gu,I want to go back...

6
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,620
...and read the letters left by my grandfather.

7
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,720
All right. That's fine,too.

8
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,720
We've met today anyway.

9
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,539
We still have a lot of time. We don't have to rush.

10
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,000
Wait.

11
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,920
Keep this.

12
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,169
Don't forget to visit me more often after you return.

13
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,320
Even if you don't visit me, I'll visit you,my god-grandson.

14
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,970
My grandson,see your godbrother off.

15
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,360
All right. Let's go,godbrother.

16
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,810
Grandfather,goodbye. -All right. Goodbye.

17
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,160
Qiming,it's ironic.

18
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,400
"Did you see the beautiful sunset?

19
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,480
Fame and fortune seem to be unimportant."

20
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,170
I owe you my life and I can't repay you for that.

21
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,960
Luckily,there's Zhuang Rui.

22
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,720
Remember what I told you all.

23
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,640
Be gentle. Be gentle when you move it!

24
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,520
They're all very expensive!

25
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,620
Be careful.

26
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,460
What are you doing? -I'm carrying stuff.

27
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,680
How can you do that? You're a rich person.

28
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,800
This is heavy labour. Why are you.....

29
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,600
Why are you doing this? Rest well and enjoy the wind.

30
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,240
Drink some milk. Do anything that makes you comfortable.

31
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,380
You're such a good person.

32
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,560
Come on,hurry up.

33
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,040
Bring it in. Be gentle. Be careful.

34
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,120
Hurry up. Come on.

35
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,760
Take a look.

36
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,120
This is the place where rich people are supposed to live.

37
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,800
It's quiet,luxurious and elegant.

38
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,740
It makes us look spiritually and culturally rich,doesn't it?

39
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,400
We have depth and we're impressive.

40
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,380
There are so many rooms. How are we going to live in them?

41
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,050
There are specific rules for one to live in a quadrangle.

42
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,250
The one facing north is the room for the owner.

43
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,580
It's a bedroom.

44
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,040
That'll be your room, as well as my room.

45
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,800
For the rooms at the east and west,the east is more superior.

46
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,000
It's normally used as a study. You can read inside.

47
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,120
That'll be where you read books.

48
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,120
As the saying goes,gentleman stay away from the kitchen.

49
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,120
So the kitchen is usually far from the master bedroom.

50
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,360
So is this the kitchen?

51
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,160
This is the bathroom.

52
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,680
This isn't ours.

53
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,140
Don't open it if it's not ours.

54
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,840
Open it and see.

55
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,659
I want to see who's the sender.

56
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,240
It's Ms. Qin. How did she know that we're moving?

57
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,400
"There isn't anything in Jiangnan. So I present to you a flower."

58
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,530
It's good stuff!

59
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,900
It's a gift for your new house. Do you like it?

60
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,570
The house is beautiful.

61
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,520
Ms. Qin,we're the ones moving. We should be buying you a meal...

62
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,600
...but you gave us a gift instead. I'm...

63
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,200
...feeling bad.

64
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,920
Just call me Bingbing. Don't be so polite.

65
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,610
I wanted to buy you a meal to celebrate that you're moving...

66
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,640
...but I have something on later. I must go to Pingzhou.

67
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,440
We'll meet next time. -Did you say Pingzhou?

68
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,460
You mean the public auction in Pingzhou?

69
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,850
What's the matter? Are you two going. too?

70
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,920
Brother Ma told us before.

71
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,720
He wants to invite us there to have a look.

72
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,280
However,we're busy moving home.

73
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,760
I don't have the time to go. Why don't you go instead?

74
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,840
I'll stay behind and be your back-up support.

75
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,080
I came here this time to tell you that...

76
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,040
...I'll contact you after I return to Beijing.

77
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,370
Your gift is too expensive.

78
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,280
I want to thank you for helping me...

79
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,720
...at the jade seminar.

80
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,280
We shall meet in Pingzhou. I'm leaving then.

81
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:14,040
I'm unsure if he will be useful to us.

82
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,040
All right. I got it.

83
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,049
What are you looking at?

84
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,520
A socialite like her from the upper-class society...

85
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,890
...lives in a different world from us.

86
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,280
If you are looking for a girlfriend,...

87
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,600
...I think that policewoman is not bad.

88
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,040
If you like the policewoman so much,...

89
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,440
...I'll greet her on your behalf next time.

90
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,120
That won't do. I'm Ms. Xiao Jia's.

91
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,840
The police is not interested in me.

92
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,960
That doesn't mean she's interested in me.

93
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,080
She is. -I think she isn't.

94
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,960
She takes out her handcuffs or gun all the time.

95
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,280
Being with her is like being in a crime film everyday.

96
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,280
What's the point?

97
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,440
I think it's pointless. Where is this?

98
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,730
This is the master bedroom.

99
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,240
Handcuffs? It sounds interesting.

100
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,600
There are so many boxes out here!

101
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,290
Am I carrying these alone? You're a disloyal friend.

102
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,170
We're rich people. How can we do this kind of work?

103
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,960
When he was 24 years old, Feng Quan got the Golden Eyes.

104
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,560
Everything around him in this world...

105
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,800
...became clearer.

106
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,480
He eventually found out that he could see through objects.

107
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,680
He could look through the slits and see the structure within.

108
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,960
However,it's disastrous to him.

109
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,880
Everything...

110
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,200
...became synonymous to death in his eyes.

111
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,960
The birds,cats and even children around him...

112
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,690
...looked like skeletons.

113
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,000
When he stared at a rock,...

114
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,480
...the lines of the rock appeared in layers.

115
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,700
He asked someone to cut open the rock.

116
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,160
He realised that the lines of the rock...

117
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,240
...were exactly the same as the ones he saw.

118
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,600
Xiao Rui,this is my buddy,San'er.

119
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,660
He stays in Pingzhou and devotes himself to jade industry.

120
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,480
He's the one who entertains me whenever I'm here.

121
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,920
San'er,this is my good friend,Zhuang Rui.

122
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,440
He's young,but he's eagle-eyed.

123
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,000
Hello. -Hello.

124
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,280
Brother Ma,are you two tired? If not,I'll bring you two...

125
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,320
...to the night market in Pingzhou.

126
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,450
After we visit the night market, we can have some tea.

127
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,560
Sure. -Does the market sell decorations?

128
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,640
Are you here in Pingzhou for the first time,buddy?

129
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,080
You can find antiques, decorations,...

130
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,040
...as well as jade from public auctions...

131
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,240
...at the night market. It's much more livelier...

132
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,760
...at night. Many come to Pingzhou...

133
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,740
...for the night market. It's your first time here.

134
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,040
You must check it out. -Sure.

135
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,000
Let's go. -All right. Let's go.

136
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,640
What are you doing? Are you daydreaming? Let's go.

137
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,640
Let's go.

138
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,800
Pingzhou Night Market is all about rules.

139
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,720
Everyone does their own things. We don't fight.

140
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,109
All jade in this night market are from public auctions.

141
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,859
Buyers are relying on their luck and foresight.

142
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,160
You can either win or lose here.

143
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,960
It's much more exciting than public auctions.

144
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,680
It's lively there. Let's go. -Sure.

145
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,280
Let's go. -Let's go.

146
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,240
Take a look.

147
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,140
Take a look at this.

148
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,440
There shouldn't be a problem if we use this for a jade bangle.

149
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,400
Buddy,aren't you being too optimistic?

150
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,530
Blue jade is popular in the market now.

151
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,060
Come on,let me have a look.

152
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,880
Take a look at this crack.

153
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,680
Is there a crack?

154
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,560
Let's look around.

155
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,060
Where is he?

156
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,200
Boss,how much is this?

157
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,540
It costs RMB50.

158
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,840
Please wrap it up for me. -All right.

159
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,620
This one is so full.

160
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,280
It's not bad.

161
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,700
I don't want it.

162
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,860
It's not transparent enough.

163
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,800
Is it?

164
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,410
This Guan Yu statue is well-sculpted.

165
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,640
It looks good. -Look at the face.

166
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,840
Buddy,look at this.

167
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,040
Take a look. -Rui.

168
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,320
Look at this one. Is it real?

169
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,080
Brother Ma,are you kidding me? What are you talking about?

170
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,200
There's only a difference in quality.

171
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,520
Boss,come here. -I'm coming.

172
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,800
When you buy things out here, you must pretend to be stupid.

173
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,120
Which one do you want?

174
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,640
Can I look at this one? -Yes,you can.

175
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,960
I'll take it out for you. You can have a look.

176
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,500
Take a look at this.

177
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,440
Cut it out.

178
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,040
This piece of jade...

179
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,200
...is old and the quality is not bad.

180
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,240
However,jade bi aren't worthy these days.

181
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,800
If you buy it,you can only keep it for two years.

182
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,160
There might be room for improvement.

183
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,720
All right. Since Xiao Zhuang has viewed it,...

184
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,200
...as an offering and rite tool in the ancient times,...

185
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,860
...the jade is worth keeping.

186
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,890
Get it for good omen.

187
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,850
As the saying goes,pretty jade is for gentlemen.

188
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,000
The reputable people use jade bi as gifts.

189
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,440
There's a trend of using bi as accessories during Han Dynasty.

190
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,100
They used it for good luck.

191
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,760
I think we can keep it. However,...

192
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,640
...does this look old originally?

193
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,880
What do you mean?

194
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,760
I'm talking about the kind of jade...

195
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,760
...that has never been buried as funerary.

196
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,440
That's what we meant.

197
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,880
In other words,we're talking about clean jade.

198
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,120
As for this..... -Boss,...

199
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,680
...how do you know that this thing isn't clean?

200
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,120
I can tell the environment where it's discovered...

201
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,360
...based on its colours.

202
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,880
First of all,look at this yellow patch.

203
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,360
This yellow patch should be caused by the soil.

204
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,320
As for the reddish brown patch, if I'm not mistaken,...

205
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,880
...it should be caused by the surrounding metal tools...

206
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,810
...when it's used as a funerary...

207
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,640
...and hence,the rusty colour.

208
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,640
This is why it has such a special colour.

209
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,480
Not bad. So it belonged to the dead.

210
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,320
Fine,you can keep it. -Brother,you can't say that.

211
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,920
This is very rare.

212
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,660
I think you should keep it.

213
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,560
It's not that worth it.

214
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,240
Boss,since you're a professional,...

215
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,520
...why don't you offer a price? Take it if it's the right price.

216
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,920
If not,I'll keep it. Is that all right?

217
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,880
Okay,sorry for troubling you. We'll go there and have a look.

218
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,920
Boss,pick the best one for me.

219
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,780
All right,please hold on. -How about 60% discount?

220
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,520
Boss,that won't work.

221
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,720
This is 2000-year-old. It has been kept so well.

222
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,000
It should worth more,right?

223
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,780
You should know that the jade bi were only collected...

224
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,410
...by the rich and powerful in ancient times.

225
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,280
If you really want to buy it, offer a more realistic price.

226
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,410
Boss,it's not fun at all for you to keep chattering here.

227
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,640
I'm in this profession,too.

228
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,760
I'm very clear about the right price and profit...

229
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,000
...of this piece of jade.

230
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,400
Treat it as exchanging goods among peers,...

231
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,320
...all right?

232
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,050
Did you see that? Ask for San'er when you're bargaining.

233
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,540
He's like a wolfdog. He's really useful.

234
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,400
Yes,he's quite a great friend.

235
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,250
He won't give up if he really wants something.

236
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,680
Since you've said that,I'll take you as my first customer.

237
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,640
I'll give 50% discount.

238
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,760
All right. Brother Ma,come here.

239
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,720
He's giving 50% discount. -You can keep it.

240
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,440
Hello,...

241
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,860
...you can charge my credit card.

242
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,400
All right. I'll wrap it up for you.

243
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,800
All right,we got another good piece of jade today.

244
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,560
Come on,don't be shy. Come on,let's eat.

245
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,720
Thank you. -Change this to a big cup.

246
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,360
A bigger cup. -This place rains often.

247
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,760
The weather is a bit cold.

248
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,960
I think it's too cold. It's too cold here.

249
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,440
You should stop drinking.

250
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,020
You should stop drinking.

251
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,480
There's ice in there. -You should stop drinking.

252
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,080
Why are you so..... -Don't.

253
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,480
You didn't touch your wine. -Dude.

254
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,320
Look.

255
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,560
You're drunk. -Are you pretending?

256
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,960
You know my alcohol tolerance level. If I drink too much.....

257
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,840
Brother Ma,let's stop drinking. We drank too much.

258
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,280
Give me a jug. -We're drunk.

259
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,610
Come on. -He can't carry us if we're drunk.

260
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,440
Let's stop drinking. -Drink this.

261
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,720
Drink this. -We can drink this.

262
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,640
This is too thick. I realised that you're basically...

263
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,600
...pretending at this table. -That's right.

264
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,080
I'm pretending. -You can't do that,but he can.

265
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,480
He can do it. -He's Xiao Zhuang.

266
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,880
Yes. Xiao Zhuang. -What? His surname is Zhuang.

267
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,920
You're pretending to be big. -I'll pretend to be Sun Tzu.

268
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,160
Are you close to Sun Tzu? -Yes.

269
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,020
Then you can pretend to be Sun Tzu.

270
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,560
I've experienced a lot with this guy,Xiao Zhuang.

271
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,360
Last time..... -Yes. When we were in Jinling,...

272
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,120
...we drank so much that I puked all over.

273
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,880
He was just fine. Now he's still pretending.

274
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,740
Yes. Why are you pretending? -No.

275
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,600
The two of us...

276
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,120
...bought a pair of chestnut lion heads last time.

277
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,240
Yes. They're from Qingshui. -Yes.

278
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,040
It's Qingshui chestnut. -They looked real in the shop.

279
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,480
After I got them,...

280
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,900
...I found that they're fake.

281
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,680
We learnt our lesson. -Yes,we did.

282
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,520
I went back and both the shop and the seller disappeared.

283
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,240
You can't regret your purchases. You can't do anything with losses.

284
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,600
Just treat it as a lesson. -I know this too well.

285
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,120
I can even be a PhD in this.

286
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,280
I keep doing it. -Come on.

287
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,480
You seem like you're just staring at us all the time.

288
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,920
What did you buy? Show it to me.

289
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,370
Yes. Xiao Zhuang. -Zhuang the expert.

290
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,300
I have this.

291
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,680
This..... -Are these broken tiles...

292
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,220
...from someone's house?

293
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,240
He is unique. -Let me see.

294
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,840
It looks like the one from passion fruit in ancient times.

295
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:01,400
It's the vassal states in Western Region.

296
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,280
Do they have passion fruit?

297
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,010
They don't have that. -They do.

298
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,720
This one must be..... Let me tell you. These are...

299
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,850
...ancient porcelain pieces,right?

300
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,200
Brother San,do you know Uncle De from Beijing?

301
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,160
Of course I do.

302
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,120
He's more than just Uncle De of Beijing.

303
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,360
He's the famous Uncle De of the antique industry.

304
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,960
He's one of the top repairmen for antique jade.

305
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,240
Who doesn't know him?

306
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,880
I saw him fixing porcelain before.

307
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,730
Is that true?

308
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,560
Collecting leftovers...

309
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,140
...is not something one pursues.

310
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,300
It's an experience that is gained over time.

311
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,600
How can there be so many leftovers for us to collect?

312
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,360
It should be endless learning.

313
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,480
From the surface,it looks like we're selecting the real ones.

314
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,840
In fact,the real technique is about increasing the value.

315
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,040
Look at these shattered pieces.

316
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,640
These are Guan ware.

317
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,480
Don't care whether it's Guan ware or civil ware.

318
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,360
Collecting porcelain is all about historical and artistic values.

319
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,280
Although these pieces aren't valuable,...

320
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,840
...if we're capable of mending them,...

321
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,720
...its price will increase more than 10 times instantly.

322
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,120
This is normal. Although it's still a defective product,...

323
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,600
...its value will be recovered.

324
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,660
So what's wrong with giving a bit of discount for it?

325
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,520
Even if the pieces aren't complete,...

326
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,520
...in Uncle De's hands,...

327
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,930
...the value can increase for more than 10 times.

328
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:20,840
This.....

329
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,360
What's wrong? -Wait a minute.

330
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,480
Did you find a passion fruit? -This is...

331
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,720
...Ru ware of Emperor Huizong's times.

332
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,560
We got it.

333
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,130
I've watched Youth before.

334
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,640
Brother,we got it.

335
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,480
We got it! -Who is it?

336
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,400
This guy got a Ru Ware of Emperor Huizong's times.

337
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,560
He is not a normal person.

338
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,700
He must be rich and wealthy in the future.

339
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,000
Of course. -Xiao Zhuang.

340
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,650
After you become rich in the future,don't forget me.

341
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,080
Sit at a side. -Don't forget us.

342
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,200
How is this related to you? -The two of us.....

343
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,600
We're the last dots of the ellipsis.

344
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,040
This..... -We're replaceable.

345
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,840
Sit down.

346
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,240
You're not included! -I must be lucky.

347
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,480
Brother Ma,I must thank you for showing me around.

348
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,240
He'll lead the horse. You can follow him with the stuff behind.

349
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,480
I will. -You're the second.....

350
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,920
I'm the second senior.

351
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,240
Cheers.

352
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,690
Why did you change it again?

353
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,970
Where's my alcohol?

354
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,400
Come on,Brother Ma. Drink it.

355
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,400
Get me a straw. -Drink it.

356
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,920
I want to drink with someone. -Let's drink.

357
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,680
Let's drink.

358
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,920
We must drink.

359
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,440
Based on the autopsy report,...

360
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,900
...the time of death was between 8pm and 10pm the night before.

361
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,840
There's anticoagulant in the mortal wound.

362
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,160
The wound was most probably caused by a sharp object.

363
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,760
The bleeding of aorta led to the death.

364
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,120
Switch on the lights.

365
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,240
When he's at Qi Yuan's tomb in Gansu,...

366
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,520
...the bomb vest that Leader Yu was wearing exploded suddenly.

367
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,560
I suspected that the grave diggers...

368
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,600
...had a slip-up.

369
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,600
His enemy wanted to kill him.

370
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,240
This time,they abandoned the body in a remote area.

371
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,600
One needs to drive here.

372
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,880
Zhao,retrieve...

373
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,480
...CCTV recordings from 6pm to 12am the night before yesterday.

374
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,600
Check if there was any car passing by.

375
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,090
Understood.

376
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,520
We must hurry up.

377
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,320
I saw it. This.....

378
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,760
Don't run! Hold it there!

379
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,600
I don't want to play anymore.

380
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,280
This is making me mad.

381
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,360
I'm calling Ms. Xiao Jia.

382
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,440
Ms. Xiao Jia,...

383
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,520
...it's me. I'm your little Yun.

384
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,420
What's the matter?

385
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,320
I know that there's a nice restaurant.

386
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,040
I'm wondering..... -I'm not free.

387
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,800
I know that you're busy.

388
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,200
You must have time to eat,right?

389
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,680
No,I'm heading to Pingzhou for work tomorrow.

390
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,400
When are you departing? I can see you off.

391
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,920
I'm going now. My flight is departing.

392
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,240
There's no signal. I'm hanging up. Bye.

393
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,720
Did she say Pingzhou?

394
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,420
Isn't your flight departing?

395
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,720
Why are you still eating happily here with me?

396
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,920
I lied. I'm going tomorrow.

397
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,380
What's the matter?

398
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,630
Who is it?

399
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,199
Brother Ma. -Brother Ma.

400
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,330
Brother Ma. -What's wrong?

401
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,480
There was a shadow that flew over there like that.

402
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,360
Then it flew back.

403
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,840
What is it? -Who is it?

404
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,960
Are you all right?

405
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,080
It scared me. -There's no one here.

406
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,280
There's nothing. -No,there was a shadow.

407
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,840
The shadow flashed and went over there.

408
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,520
Brother Ma. -It disappeared.

409
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,440
This is the third floor.

410
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,000
I know,but there was a shadow flashing by.

411
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,600
It wasn't just the shadow. There were the lights,too.

412
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,600
They flashed,too.

413
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,500
Why aren't they flashing now?

414
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,380
They're not flashing.

415
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,400
They flashed. They did just now.

416
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,240
Brother Ma, are you sure you saw it?

417
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,960
I'm old. Why should I lie to you?

418
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,720
The shadow flashed across me.

419
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,700
The face that was facing me...

420
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,040
...carried a rush of cold air.

421
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,770
Brother,has anything like this happened to you before?

422
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,720
No. If it did, I would've been dead.

423
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,920
What's going on? -Brother Ma,...

424
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,840
...did you take in any old item lately?

425
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,440
Everything I keep is old.

426
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,720
Who would want new stuff? -No.

427
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,370
That's not what I meant. I'm talking about...

428
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,740
...something that's retrieved from underground.

429
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,360
That's how I make a living.

430
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,360
Don't get me wrong.  I work in a mine.

431
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,300
Isn't coal retrieved from underground?

432
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,840
Is there a nasty spirit here?

433
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,960
The fortune teller told me that it'd be a bad year for me.

434
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,640
So I've been staying away from old stuff.

435
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,960
I only play with rocks. -Rocks.

436
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,760
The rock.

437
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,920
It was still here just now. I mean the jade.

438
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,800
The jade. This.....

439
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,880
I didn't see it.

440
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,000
Is this the one?

441
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,120
Wasn't this obtained from underground?

442
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,600
What if the evil spirit...

443
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,220
...got hold of this piece of jade?

444
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,080
Is that possible?

445
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,120
You're totally right.

446
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,200
Jade has a strong attraction.

447
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,880
Someone wore a jade bangle dug from a grave.

448
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,760
After that,a lot of things happened to that person.

449
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,160
It's because the jade carried a bad aura from the grave.

450
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,960
Don't panic,Brother Ma.

451
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,880
We have a solution.

452
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:57,520
Find a master and perform a ritual to cleanse it.

453
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,330
Then it'll be fine. This happens all the time.

454
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,000
It often happens. -Yes,it does.

455
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,880
What if it isn't cleansed properly?

456
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,770
If it's not cleansed properly,...

457
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,840
...that could lead to one losing his family.

458
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,120
What?

459
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,400
Brother,it's fine.

460
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,520
This doesn't happen a lot.

461
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,320
It's really rare. -It's scary.

462
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,280
Brother Ma,don't panic.

463
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,680
Whenever this happens,...

464
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,600
...how do you solve it?

465
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,640
Tell me.

466
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,170
There is a solution.

467
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,000
Just return it to the original owner.

468
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,120
What?

469
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,440
You mean...

470
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,300
...returning the item? -Yes.

471
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,600
Think about it. If this thing...

472
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,920
...had an owner who was powerful,...

473
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,600
...of course it'd torture its current owner.

474
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,760
Am I right? Basically,...

475
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,860
...just return the thing that belongs to someone else.

476
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,610
Then you'll be fine. Am I right?

477
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,880
Yes. It sounds right. -That's right.

478
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,120
I have a question.

479
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,680
Why is the boss of the antique shop fine?

480
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,000
That's right. -Maybe he's different.

481
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,680
Perhaps he's compatible with the item.

482
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,680
I'm unlucky. -It was fine all along.

483
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,480
Once it's with you..... -I'm so unlucky.

484
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,680
Brother Ma,it's fine. Like what I've said,...

485
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,880
...we don't know what's going on.

486
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,160
I'll ask a master to perform a ritual tomorrow.

487
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,120
We'll cleanse it. Then maybe it'll be fine.

488
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,760
Don't simply mess with it.

489
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,200
If you offend it, it'll be troublesome.

490
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,320
This.....

491
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:44,930
How about...

492
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:49,760
...I bring you to talk to the boss?

493
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,920
Ask him to return half of your money.

494
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,000
No. Didn't you say that...

495
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,860
...there are rules in the industry of antiques?

496
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:07,400
It's a mutual agreement. You can't return nor change it.

497
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,920
How can you do that?

498
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,560
Yes,there is this rule,...

499
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,440
...but this item is possessed. -That's right.

500
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,580
This is negotiable in the industry of antiques.

501
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,200
Brother Ma,it's fine. I'll bring you there. How about this?

502
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,800
We'll leave the item here.

503
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,930
Let's not stay in this house today.

504
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,000
We're not staying here. Let's go.

505
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,640
Don't change it. Can you sleep with me for a night?

506
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,040
I..... -I don't snore.

507
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,880
That's right. -All right.

508
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,560
Let's go to my place. -I'll join you...

509
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,620
...to go to the shop tomorrow. -Sure.

510
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,320
We can strengthen our presence. -Let's go.

511
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,880
Let's not stay here anymore. Let's go.

512
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,920
The item..... -Leave it here.

513
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,610
Xiao Zhuang!

514
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,700
I'm coming right away.

515
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,400
Uncle Gu.

516
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,960
Can you do me a favour?
