1
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,500
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,800
Episode 6

3
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,320
Qi Yuan claimed to have unique observation skill himself,...

4
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,360
...but this doesn't ensure that he wouldn't make mistake.

5
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,840
I glanced through the objects in this tomb.

6
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,660
Many of them are ordinary.

7
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,170
Let me take a look again.

8
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,560
Well,it's true.

9
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,259
This jade was a replication of the carvings of Han Dynasty.

10
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,870
Professor,it might be a bluff for him to...

11
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,040
...claim to have special eyesight.

12
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,040
Come and look at this. This explains the issue.

13
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,850
Look at this.

14
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,480
The "Biography of Feng Sheng"? -Do you know him?

15
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,360
Could it be Feng Quan?

16
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,280
Then tell me about Feng Quan.

17
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,040
His story was introduced in the "Strange Tales of Chinese Studio".

18
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,720
Professor Meng,you've just mentioned that...

19
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,920
...Qi Yuan has special eyesight,then I thought of Feng Quan.

20
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,040
On his arm,he implanted a treasure...

21
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,930
...and he acquired the eyes that never fail to recognise treasure.

22
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,160
I couldn't assure just now. We've found this biography now.

23
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,960
It was the story of Feng Quan.

24
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,160
Come,look at this.

25
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,920
You see? It was written clearly.

26
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,960
So,Qi Yuan was a fan of Feng Quan.

27
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,320
He wanted to have the same eyesight as his idol.

28
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,920
These are supernatural things. For sure we won't believe them.

29
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,120
To improve on our own connoisseurship,...

30
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,200
...we have to rely on gathering experience and knowledge.

31
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,660
Yes,that's right. -This is the correct way.

32
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,880
Xiao Ren,register all these. -All right.

33
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,020
Professor Meng and the team are almost done.

34
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,760
Look out!

35
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,840
It's earthquake! -No.

36
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,620
It's an explosion!

37
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,800
Hello,miss.

38
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,320
If Boss Yu was busted,will you be discovered?

39
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,080
Yes.

40
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:48,760
All right. You'll decide what to do on your own.

41
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,400
All right.

42
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,100
Ask him to stop! -Stop!

43
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,700
Or else,you'll never get a penny.

44
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,920
What do we do,boss?

45
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,680
Fall back!

46
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,600
Professor,is it the activation of some mechanism?

47
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,300
It sounds like an explosion. -Is Officer Miao.....

48
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,600
Here. The intercom.

49
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,600
Officer Miao? Zhuang Rui? Are you two all right?

50
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,200
Officer Miao? Zhuang Rui?

51
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,300
Zhuang Rui!

52
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:55,820
Zhuang Rui!

53
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:05,720
Zhuang Rui,wake up! Zhuang Rui!

54
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,120
Zhuang Rui!

55
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,520
Are you okay?

56
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,780
Don't bother about me. Go after them.

57
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,780
Look out for yourself.

58
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,530
Professor,let's leave this place first.

59
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:40,040
All right. Clean up. We'll go up first then.

60
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,370
Okay.

61
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,600
Give a hand to Professor Ren. -All right.

62
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,960
Here,move this first. -All right.

63
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,280
Here.

64
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,840
Be careful.

65
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,720
Hurry!

66
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,059
Come on!

67
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,450
Let's go! -Let's go!

68
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,050
The target is obvious. Let's split up.

69
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,040
Let's go!

70
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,120
Xiao Li,are you okay?

71
00:08:59,280 --> 00:08:59,810
I'm okay.

72
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:04,960
Get up.

73
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,400
Are you two all right? -Sister,we're all right.

74
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,900
Boss Yu fled. Go after him first. We'll take care of it here.

75
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,930
Then watch out for yourselves.

76
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,260
Come on.

77
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,920
Brother,have you just arrived? -I was busy.

78
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,850
Go ahead. -Yes,I'm busy right now.

79
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,000
Drink up! -Sure! All right!

80
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,020
Have you just arrived?

81
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,880
Have you just arrived now? -Let's drink inside later.

82
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,880
You just came? -Yes.

83
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,480
Is everyone here? -You're here!

84
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,080
Yes. Don't worry about me here. -You can sit over there.

85
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,960
Why are you so late? We're waiting for you.

86
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,160
You're here. -Yes.

87
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,560
Come and sit! Hurry! You need to drink as penalty!

88
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,040
Penalty! -Here!

89
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,800
I'll drink it with you. -Sure.

90
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,240
Drink up! -Uncle Liu.

91
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,440
Uncle Liu.

92
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,320
The firecracker you gave me was a great one.

93
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,280
It's loud and clear. There's not even one damp squib.

94
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,210
That's nothing.

95
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,440
I'll give you another one when you have your first-born.

96
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,760
Sure! -Congratulations.

97
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,120
Deliver a lovely child soon. -Thank you,Uncle Liu.

98
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,800
Make yourself at home. Come on.

99
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,720
Let's drink. Congratulations.

100
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,240
Thank you for coming. I'll give you a toast.

101
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,160
Go away!

102
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,400
Drop your gun,Boss Yu! -You drop your gun!

103
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,640
Or I'll shoot her!

104
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,930
Prepare a car for me now!

105
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,840
What are you trying to do?

106
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,800
Release her. I'll be the hostage.

107
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,520
Zhuang Rui,are you nuts?

108
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,240
Are you trying to be a hero?

109
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,960
All right. Be my guest then.

110
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,600
Shoot.

111
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,920
You asked for it.

112
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,760
There's a bomb! -Zhuang Rui!

113
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,640
Get up!

114
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:09,900
Zhuang Rui!

115
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,400
Get up!

116
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,640
You almost lost your life!

117
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,650
Do you believe in me now?

118
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,250
If you die,I'll doubt you forever.

119
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,160
Were you not afraid of him shooting you?

120
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,010
I felt that he was out of bullet.

121
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,920
You felt?

122
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,280
Are you insane?

123
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:54,640
Hello?

124
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,960
Zhuang Rui,are you all right?

125
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,280
I.....

126
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,930
I'm at the wedding banquet.

127
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,120
Okay. I'll talk to you soon.

128
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,370
Just leave it there.

129
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,360
Xiao Zhuang,thank you for this trip to Gansu.

130
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,240
Don't mention it. Being with you and Professor Ren together...

131
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,970
...is an honour. Thank you so much for helping me.

132
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,320
You can come over here any time you want.

133
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,280
Oh yes,Professor Meng,will the unearthed relics...

134
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,170
...be exhibited in the museum?

135
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,880
I don't think so. They're not of great value.

136
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,280
So,after the registration,we'll keep and seal them.

137
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,120
Can I take a few pictures? -Not necessary.

138
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,120
I'll send the pictures to you through WeChat afterwards...

139
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,400
...as a souvenir for your first archeology trip,all right?

140
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,960
Thank you. -Professor,...

141
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,780
...these are the receipts that require your signature. Here.

142
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,600
All done? -Yes,all done.

143
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:08,579
Hold your breath and be still,and the eyes of wisdom shall see.

144
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,490
Through extreme environment,enlightenments shall be received.

145
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,460
Hold your breath and be still,and the eyes of wisdom shall see.

146
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,240
Sister,are you okay? Did you hurt yourself?

147
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,200
Here. Let me get you up. Here.

148
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,560
Are you hurt? Do you want me to send you to the hospital?

149
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,840
I'm all right. I'm fine.

150
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,760
Are you sure? Be careful then.

151
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,000
Be careful while you're walking. -Thank you.

152
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,880
Goodbye.

153
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,560
You dropped your wallet.

154
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,880
Thank you. -You're welcome.

155
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,000
Hi. Hi. -Hi. I'm back.

156
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,260
What happened?

157
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,840
Xiao Rui Rui,you're back at last.

158
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,360
The money is gone.

159
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,570
It's okay. Don't be discouraged. Money can be earned again.

160
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,620
Now that I think about it,I just want to slap myself.

161
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,490
Forget it. Stop doing that.

162
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,960
Keep this. Take it as a lesson,okay?

163
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,160
This lesson is worth 2 million.

164
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,720
Should we just let it be?

165
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,080
Don't worry. I'm still here,right?

166
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,970
Besides,didn't you say you're my lucky star?

167
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,610
Xiao Rui Rui.

168
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,120
You're so kind.

169
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,720
That's right.

170
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,240
Although there was explosion in Qi Yuan's Tomb,we got intel.

171
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,760
Qi Yuan didn't obtain the power of Golden Eyes.

172
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:11,960
All right.

173
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,920
We've got this room renovated. The facility is of good quality.

174
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,930
For the temperature,we just need to.....

175
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,240
Well.....

176
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,120
Yin,Yang and Heaven unseal hidden world.

177
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,880
It possesses power yet understands things to the finest.

178
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,720
Eternally and unceasingly...

179
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,680
...as the River of Hades and as the Golden Eyes.

180
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,440
As the Golden Eyes?

181
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,040
Golden Eyes.

182
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,560
Have you examined it? Has it spoiled?

183
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,420
Why are you asking this suddenly?

184
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,600
Miss officer.

185
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,420
Those are yet to rinse.

186
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,840
Why are you here? -I'm on leave,and I'm bored.

187
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,040
Also,I'm here to appreciate someone...

188
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,720
...that offered his great support in the operation in Gansu.

189
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,250
So,I came to pay him a visit.

190
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,480
Meanwhile,...

191
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,800
...I'm here to see how a 2-million vase looks like.

192
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,560
Don't touch it.

193
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,880
How rich you are.

194
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,140
You were scammed but still not reporting to the police.

195
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,420
You don't understand.

196
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,200
In the antique industry,if you break...

197
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,520
...any unsold merchandise...

198
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:03,680
...displaying on the shelf,it's consider sold.

199
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,280
This is the rule among the connoisseurs.

200
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,880
We rich men must be reasonable.

201
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,690
Understood.

202
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,600
It means,some connoisseurs...

203
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,960
...scam explicitly.

204
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,640
Are you both not feeling agitated looking at this vase every day?

205
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,360
How much money do we have?

206
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,320
What are you trying to do?

207
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,480
Mr. Qian.

208
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,000
Mr. Qian!

209
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,400
Mr. Huangfu,...

210
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,840
...you were being careless,and broke my stuff.

211
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,720
Why are you still here looking for me?

212
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,120
Who doesn't pay for lessons to learn about antiques?

213
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,050
You both are holding grudges and being unforgiving.

214
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,640
Mr. Qian,it's not about carelessness.

215
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,760
If it was our mistake,we'd admit it.

216
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,580
But now,it's clear that you're scamming us.

217
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,140
So,it's not about carelessness.

218
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,220
Well,we're not feeling sorry for the money.

219
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,960
Just that this is unreasonable.

220
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,020
If it's unreasonable,then don't step into my shop.

221
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,440
I still have 479 merchandise in this shop.

222
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,300
Do you really want to break the most expensive merchandise...

223
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,970
...then only you know you couldn't compensate for the loss?

224
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:20,810
Mr. Qian.

225
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,660
What? Are you showing off your money?

226
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,160
To round it up,2 million.

227
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,260
Let's make a bet...

228
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,040
...on my eyes.

229
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,160
Would you take it? 2 million!

230
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,920
How much was it? All in for 2 million?

231
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,680
I have no time to joke around. I should just do my business.

232
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,480
Who's fooling with 2 million?

233
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,080
Mr. Qian.

234
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,680
How many businesses do you have to do to earn 2 million?

235
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,600
Give me an hour.

236
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,840
Let me search for the most valuable thing in this shop.

237
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,040
If I failed,...

238
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,640
...then this 2 million is all yours.

239
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,400
Take it as our tuition fee. -He's giving away 2 million.

240
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,440
But if I managed to find it,I'll take it.

241
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,800
We'll let things slide.

242
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:32,120
Would you dare to put a bet?

243
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,040
I'm a businessman.

244
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,360
You present me with money like this.

245
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,320
I have no reason to refuse.

246
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,600
The countdown starts now.

247
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,280
Mr. Qian.

248
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,520
Mr. Qian.

249
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,080
Didn't you mention that there are almost 500 merchandise here?

250
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
If this young man could identify it within an hour,...

251
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,080
...and this incident spreads out,...

252
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,160
...your peers will be laughing at you,right?

253
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,330
How can you say that? Mr. Qian has said,...

254
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,620
...he'll not bully the young people.

255
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,160
I think Xiao Rui can identify it.

256
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,740
If Mr. Qian won't give us a hint,then we'll trust Xiao Rui's sight.

257
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,180
Am I right? He's not afraid of losing,...

258
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,520
...then why should we be afraid?

259
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,240
You all set the rules.

260
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,000
Just tell me if you need some tips.

261
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,820
How would I know if you're not telling me?

262
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,300
You refuse to give in and are being proud.

263
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:41,160
All right then. I'm known for being generous.

264
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,400
In this shop,the valuables...

265
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,120
...are ceramics. There are only 50 plus ceramics here.

266
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,850
I think I'm not making things difficult for the youngsters.

267
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,320
Mr. Zhuang.

268
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,480
2 minutes have passed.

269
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,080
You've only looked at about 50 merchandise.

270
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:53,120
You can't afford to lose any minute now.

271
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,080
Time is money now.

272
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,640
Mr. Qian.

273
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,640
You know what you display on the rack.

274
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,720
Tell me the truth. Are you having no clues?

275
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,000
Look again if you can't get any clues.

276
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:21,480
After all,it's an opportunity to learn.

277
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,930
It's not that we have no clues,but you don't understand.

278
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,200
Let me interpret for you.

279
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,810
The truth is,...

280
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,880
...these are all trash.

281
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,760
Trash.

282
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,880
Kicking? Kick whoever you want!

283
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,920
Let me tell you. 5 minutes have passed.

284
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,610
I can tell that you like that cricket more.

285
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,440
Why not I give this cricket to you?

286
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,240
Cricket?

287
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:18,960
You made it?

288
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,600
It's called "100-day-bug" too. Its life span is short.

289
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,960
It can never survive the winter solstice,...

290
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,520
...but the joy it brings...

291
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,760
...will remain.

292
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,920
Bingbing,I'm not boasting.

293
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,720
None can be evenly matched with us Xu family in Beijing.

294
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,400
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

295
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,400
I'll bring you to some good food. What do you want to eat?

296
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,260
French,Japanese,or steamboat?

297
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,620
There is a nice steak shop at 3rd Ring Road. Let's have that.

298
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,880
Hello,Bingbing.

299
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,000
What are you thinking? -I'm sorry.

300
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,320
I was lost in thought. I didn't hear what you said.

301
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,150
You can tell me all your worries.

302
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,400
West Royal Jewellery is going to participate in...

303
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,800
...the first China Jewellery Exchange Conference.

304
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,400
I'm just worried about that.

305
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,080
So that's what you worry about.

306
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:37,230
The participants of the Jewellery Exchange Conference...

307
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:41,630
...are all my friends. I'll help you out by then.

308
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,920
As for you,just be pretty and stand next to me happily.

309
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,310
That's it.

310
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,400
Thank you.

311
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,280
So,this is...

312
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,200
...Ru ware,right? -Ge ware.

313
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,400
Right. So,this is how it looks like.

314
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,640
The plum blossom pattern is nice. We can tell it's original.

315
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,940
The replication is interesting.

316
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,680
Three-coloured Horse. -You have good insight.

317
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,480
This is Black-glazed Three-coloured Horse.

318
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,540
Breed of dragon,running on the snow.

319
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,800
These are all rare relics in Tang Pottery.

320
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,560
Look at the expression and the curves.

321
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,210
For sure it's a replica.

322
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,620
Everything seems original to me.

323
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,720
How can he determine the authenticity with just one glance?

324
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,360
Then,how can you differentiate the good guy from the bad guy?

325
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,600
I just can.

326
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,320
He can too.

327
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,570
So,you've decided on this?

328
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,360
It's still hot. Was it fired 2 years ago?

329
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,160
Mr. Qian,are you up to something again?

330
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:05,880
I.....

331
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,560
Fei Fei! -Mr. Gu,it's been a while! Sit!

332
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,320
All right. -Sir,you're early today.

333
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,680
Take a seat. -All right.

334
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,410
This Pu'er has been brewed for 3 times. It's good.

335
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,520
Thank you. -Fei Fei,why are you here?

336
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,240
Just tell me what you desire and I'll buy it for you.

337
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,320
What do you mean? Which kind of place?

338
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,880
Mr. Xiao Gu,the guests are here. Could you talk nicely?

339
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:35,800
Lao Qian,you've invited me to the fullmoon party of your son.

340
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,400
You're doing something great. Are you...

341
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,730
...trying to scam and snatch us,or trying to kill and rob us?

342
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:48,800
Mr. Gu,my friend Zhuang Rui is betting with Mr. Qian.

343
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,260
If you're here to oversee,I'm relieved.

344
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,120
A bet? This is fun!

345
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,640
I stand on my ground.

346
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,920
If you choose the right one,take it. I have nothing to say.

347
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,000
If you made a mistake or failed,...

348
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,400
...then you must pay me. Don't break the promise.

349
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,260
You can't take back your word.

350
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,700
Is this thing real?

351
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,560
Well..... -No,I think...

352
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,220
...it's not authentic at all.

353
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,400
The valuables must be hidden somewhere,right?

354
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,520
If it's displayed here every day,...

355
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,490
...it might be broken. You see? It's rusty and dusty.

356
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,720
Young man,don't say that.

357
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,620
This is one of the finest things here,...

358
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,880
...Yongzheng porcelain.

359
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,450
Look at the drawing on the plate,"Qilin Delivers A Son".

360
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,730
Look at the work and the colour. How could it be a replica?

361
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,280
As the saying goes,everything starts with Yongzheng porcelain.

362
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,400
This real Min ware almost matches the Guan ware.

363
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,240
You have good insight. Let's decide on this.

364
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,120
Mr. Qian,look.

365
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,520
It's made during the reign of Yongzheng of Qing Dynasty.

366
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,650
Did you say it was Guan ware or Min ware?

367
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,700
Believe it or not. You don't have much time left.

368
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,360
Mr. Qian,if this is the real Yongzheng porcelain,...

369
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,880
...then is our vase really the Ru ware of Warring State?

370
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,240
Warring State? They were using bronzeware,weren't they?

371
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,900
Where did they get the Ru ware?

372
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,600
That's why,Mr. Qian,your deceitful trick...

373
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,760
...is superb.

374
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,120
Ru ware of Warring State.

375
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,800
Mr. Qian,you're tricky.

376
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,240
If the youngsters want to jest,...

377
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,400
...we can play along.

378
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,680
Mr. Qian,we'll keep our promise.

379
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,650
Are you certain that...

380
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,460
...the most prized treasure of the shop is ceramic?

381
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,560
It is ceramic. It's rare,right?

382
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,120
Yes,it's rare.

383
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,080
It's certainly hard to spot the most precious item...

384
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,240
...among trash. -Trash.

385
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,360
Trash.

386
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,400
I like the way that young man talks.

387
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,640
Trash?

388
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,360
I've learned another English word. -Time is running out.
