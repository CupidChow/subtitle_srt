1
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,500
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,000
Episode 56

3
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,800
The doctor said that the object in your brain...

4
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,240
...is fused with the cranial nerves.

5
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,280
If we want to remove that object completely,...

6
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,040
...you may have to take a risk.

7
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,920
I've been thinking.

8
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,160
Without the Golden Eyes,what will you become?

9
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,760
Without the Golden Eyes,...

10
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,440
...I'm still Zhuang Rui.

11
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,400
Sorry,I should not ask that.

12
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,320
The surgery will begin anytime soon.

13
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,620
However,the anaesthesia dose.....

14
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,640
Police! The police are outside! -Stop them.

15
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,480
Okay.

16
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,040
Start the surgery now. Immediately. Hurry!

17
00:03:45,040 --> 00:04:14,800
Hurry!

18
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,459
Zhuang Rui! -What are you doing? Don't move.

19
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,520
What do you want to do?

20
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,680
Ma Tengfeng,that's enough.

21
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,440
The police are outside now.

22
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,159
Really? No one can stop me.

23
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,360
I must obtain the Golden Eyes. If not.....

24
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,320
Hurry. -Zhuang Rui!

25
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,960
Zhuang Rui!

26
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,760
Hang in there.

27
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,060
Hang in there,Zhuang Rui.

28
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,360
Zhuang Rui.

29
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:37,720
Zhuang Rui,hang it there.

30
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,840
You cannot enter. -No.

31
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,640
We are his friends. -Thank you.

32
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,720
Xiaoyun!

33
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,080
Xiaorui!

34
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,450
Are you okay?

35
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,159
Qin Xuanbing,someone is here to visit you.

36
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,680
Mr. Nakagawa wrote to me about what happened in Kiev.

37
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,620
Everything has come to an end.

38
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,720
It's the end.

39
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,240
Why are you here?

40
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,600
Right,...

41
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,530
...I have a gift for you.

42
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,800
I'll ask the police to give it to you.

43
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,600
Is it another toy?

44
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,000
You.....

45
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,200
Do you think that...

46
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,880
...I like those toys?

47
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,800
If you are still that innocent Qin Xuanbing...

48
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,640
...whom I first met...

49
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,370
...you will like it.

50
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,520
Thank you.

51
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,360
We will use this as model today.

52
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,480
Here. Excuse me.

53
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,170
Be careful,slowly.

54
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,520
I'll blow on it for you. Give me your hand.

55
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,440
My face is also scalded. -Really? Let me see.

56
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,840
Here. -Where?

57
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,640
What is it? -Get busy.

58
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,640
Zhuang Rui! -Zhuang Rui!

59
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,960
Hurry and help me. -Give us a hand.

60
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,880
I brought Mutton. -Brother Ma and Professor Meng.

61
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,010
Why are you all here?

62
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,860
Feifei said there's a huge feast and asks us to come.

63
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,720
I followed the smell of the mutton.

64
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,520
I was cold and hungry these days. I should eat while you're here.

65
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,880
They're organic mutton. Let's feast on them today.

66
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,580
Yes,have a feast. -Come,sit.

67
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,880
I wanted to bring 2 bottles of wine but you brought 2 goats.

68
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,360
Professor Meng,you are too courteous.

69
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,560
This is really not my idea. Ba Te'er asked me to bring them.

70
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,080
Ba Te'er? -He heard that you are unwell.

71
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,760
He doesn't have your address so he asked County Head Zhao...

72
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,960
...to send to my research centre. -I've never met Ba Te'er.

73
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,900
He is quite practical. -Xiaofei.

74
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,560
Let me. -Ba Te'er is a good person.

75
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,280
Here. -Sure,let me.

76
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,680
Look at my wine. It's nothing compared to your mutton.

77
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,800
Xiaorui.

78
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,370
Why is Feifei written here?

79
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,320
It seems that he is concerned about Feifei.

80
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,560
He just used you as an excuse. -Don't differentiate.

81
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,780
Feifei. -Let's eat together.

82
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,240
See? Feifei is not so calculative now.

83
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,500
Huang Fuyun,are you asking to be hit?

84
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,520
Okay,that's enough. Don't argue when you meet.

85
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,960
Let's cook the meat. -Here.

86
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,280
The water is already boiling. -Here.

87
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,600
Everyone's here. Pour the wine. -I'll pour for you.

88
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,200
Thank you. -How much you want?

89
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,920
No,Brother Ma. I shouldn't drink.

90
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,840
I'm afraid of being drunk. -That's the point of drinking.

91
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,560
You must drink a lot. -Thank you.

92
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,600
Professor. -Thank you.

93
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,200
Have a full cup. -Please don't.

94
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,460
I can't drink. -Eat up.

95
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,040
Thank you. -Zhuang Rui,say something.

96
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,920
Yes,that's right. Say something. -I.....

97
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,080
What should I say? -Just a few words.

98
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,440
Look at you. You never talk properly.

99
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,600
That's right. Everyone is here to visit you.

100
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,640
If you don't say anything,we will not dare to eat.

101
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,720
That's right. -That's enough.

102
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,040
The doctor said that Zhuang Rui cannot eat spicy food.

103
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,240
Huang Fuyun actually organised a steamboat gathering.

104
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,120
Isn't this for the good of everyone?

105
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,480
It's rare to get together. I cannot let us eat vegetables.

106
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,080
Am I right,Brother Ma? -Yes.

107
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,480
You cannot say get together for the sake of anyone.

108
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,800
We're gathering to be have fun,right?

109
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,720
Yes. -I'll go first.

110
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,180
I'll say a few words first.

111
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,680
We are here today because of a common friend.

112
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,320
A very good friend.

113
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,880
When we are with him,we trust him unconditionally.

114
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,090
When we are in trouble or face any problem,...

115
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,210
...you will think of him first.

116
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,800
Although he is calm and doesn't say much,...

117
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,560
...but he will come out and help at crucial moments.

118
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,520
Here. Let's drink for his health.

119
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,560
For his health and success. -Good!

120
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,960
Cheers!

121
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,880
Hurry and eat up. -I will not praise you.

122
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,960
Zhuang Rui,staying here...

123
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,280
...suits you perfectly.

124
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,440
Brother Ma,don't you think it suits me better?

125
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,500
You more suitable in Old Wang's house next door.

126
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,360
Are you still thinking?

127
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,840
Fine,I'll say first.

128
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,560
Feifei,eat up.

129
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,560
I've grown up with Zhuang Rui since young.

130
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,200
My brother is like this,...

131
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,300
...he's silly.

132
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,720
He is very honest and always thinks that everyone is kind.

133
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,320
Thus,he is lied to and hurt by others.

134
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,960
So,I often advise him. I say...

135
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,400
...it's good to be clever. I hope he can learn and grow.

136
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,000
After that,I realise he is clever...

137
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,010
...but not calculative. I'm not saying that he is careless.

138
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:11,520
He is not cunning,am I right?

139
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,310
In the end,I can conclude that...

140
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,040
...because he is not cunning,he has us as his friends.

141
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,569
Correct.

142
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,200
So,Zhuang Rui,you aren't stupid.

143
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:25,300
Cheers.

144
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,280
Good. -Good!

145
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,880
It's your turn. -You can really hold your drink.

146
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,680
I'll pour you a drink. -Okay,I'll stand up.

147
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,200
Firstly,I was quite lonely in the beginning.

148
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,280
I was alone in Beijing.

149
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,720
I was quite hopeless. I never imagined that...

150
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,160
...I'll meet good friends like you.

151
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,440
Thank you for your concern,love...

152
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,500
...and care for me.

153
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,560
I'm happy to meet you all. You're so kind.

154
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,720
Here,let's drink. -Yes,let's drink. Cheers.

155
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,560
Cheers. -Cheers!

156
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,600
Finish the wine...

157
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,320
...and refill it.

158
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:26,880
Don't return if you aren't drunk.

159
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:29,880
Cheers!

160
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,400
They eat a lot. -They have finally left.

161
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,320
I finally see Brother Ma drunk. -He is happy today.

162
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,400
You're still eating. -Stop eating.

163
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,970
You have finished the mutton by yourself.

164
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,160
The mutton is to be eaten anyway. -But...

165
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,040
...don't finish it in a meal. -Eat more. It's okay.

166
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:04,720
Right,...

167
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,040
...I have something to tell you.

168
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,320
I went to the hospital today.

169
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,440
Hospital? -Are you feeling unwell again?

170
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,010
I went to find a professor with the surname Hu.

171
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,740
I want to have a surgery...

172
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,210
...to remove the debris...

173
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,360
...from here.

174
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,480
The experts say that the abnormality in my eyes...

175
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,320
...is due to injured optic nerves.

176
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,200
I need to undergo surgery to become normal again.

177
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,400
Xiaorui,you really want to give up on the Golden Eyes.

178
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,610
Can you bear to part with it?

179
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,880
I'm not trying to stop you. I think of...

180
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,960
...how Ma Tengfeng risked his life...

181
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,480
...for your Golden Eyes.

182
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,000
If your body is fine,...

183
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,850
...you don't need to have surgery.

184
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,720
I finally understand...

185
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,840
...the words carved onto Feng Quan's tomb.

186
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,000
The extreme darkness...

187
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,160
...is the light.

188
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,450
After returning from Kiev,...

189
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,920
...I dreamed about the mechanism at Feng Quan's tomb.

190
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,600
I always thought that...

191
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,690
...it's because of the Golden Eyes...

192
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,660
...that I have such a strange experience...

193
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,280
...and have a group of supportive friends...

194
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,480
...while solving problems.

195
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,690
But the mechanism outside the tomb...

196
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,900
...was not solved by the Golden Eyes.

197
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,250
On the contrary,...

198
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,320
...it's because of your help and my efforts...

199
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,250
...that we went through it.

200
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,560
The extreme darkness is the light.

201
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,450
The darkness is also full of light.

202
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,280
There is no shortcut to life.

203
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,800
I should give up on the Golden Eyes...

204
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,560
...to be able to live again.

205
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,530
Well,...

206
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,530
...have you thought this through?

207
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,200
Letting go of the Golden Eyes...

208
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,000
...is not a loss but a cure for my illness.

209
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,560
I can resume a normal life...

210
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,340
...and be a normal person.

211
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,280
I should also be brave to face all obstacles.

212
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,540
I only realise now that...

213
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,320
...the most important thing is not the Golden Eyes...

214
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,320
...but all of you.

215
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,700
As long as I have all of you,...

216
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,520
...the Golden Eyes is not that important.

217
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,800
As long as you have decided,we will support you.

218
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,640
Did Professor Hu mention any risks?

219
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,520
It's not that simple,right?

220
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,200
It's not that important.

221
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,320
But I don't regret...

222
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,820
...making this decision.

223
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,640
Okay. I'm going out for a walk...

224
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,200
...for some fresh air. -Then,...

225
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,700
...come back earlier.

226
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,160
We have worked here for 2 years. We can finally reward ourselves.

227
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,720
We're here! The food is here!

228
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,250
Let's eat good food today. It's imported!

229
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,610
You call this good food?

230
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,160
Why did you buy so many instant noodles?

231
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,160
Don't you know instant noodles isn't good for health?

232
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,440
Health?

233
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,960
I live like this. Why bother about health?

234
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,520
What's important is we're full.

235
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,960
When we are rich,we can eat what we want,right?

236
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,880
Don't have to worry about wasting food.

237
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,700
Close your eyes and think.

238
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,880
What is the first food to appear in your mind?

239
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,800
Braised pork rice. -Okay.

240
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,860
Braised pork rice. Imagine you're eating that now.

241
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,200
Braised pork taste.

242
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,800
This fork quality is bad.

243
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,920
I want to eat fried chicken drumstick.

244
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,760
Then,you're eating fried chicken now.

245
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,660
Delicious.

246
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,120
Here,for our glorious future. Cheers!

247
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,640
Here. -Cheers!

248
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,520
Ones,tens,hundreds,thousands,ten thousands,millions!

249
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,320
Xiaorui,we are going to be rich soon!

250
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,080
I'm your brother.

251
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,810
No matter what you decide to do,...

252
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,320
...I'll support you.

253
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,440
Everyone has bad days. If you keep going,they will pass.

254
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,400
Listen to me. Take it. It will bring you luck.

255
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,080
How far can you go with luck?

256
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,640
So,you should seek the truth,...

257
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,080
...be humble and persevere.

258
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,930
Only then you can stand strong.

259
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,600
To find what you like...

260
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,680
...is not easy.

261
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,200
It's even more difficult to do what you like.

262
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,040
So,you must not give up easily because of a problem.

263
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,840
It's not fair to those things that you like.

264
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,560
Surprise! Welcome to Ruiyunzhai. -Thank you.

265
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,520
Peng Fei! Don't be impulsive! -Don't stop me.

266
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,720
Don't be impulsive! -Don't stop me!

267
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,520
Is this the friend you were talking about?

268
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,760
Wait! Didn't you say you're all in?

269
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,920
Let it go. Admit that you've lost.

270
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,400
Hurry and package the 11 items for them.

271
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,680
I'm your god-grandfather from now on. Are you fine with it?

272
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,160
Grandfather. -That's right.

273
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,800
You are quite lucky.

274
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,600
You can obtain a jade from a junk.

275
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,620
My pension depends on you from now on.

276
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,480
Gem Association? Am I qualified?

277
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,000
Xiaorui,remember.

278
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,280
No matter what happens,I will protect you.

279
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,840
We have made preparation...

280
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,800
...to remove the object hurting your optic nerves.

281
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,600
Your sight will return to normal.

282
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,280
Your illness will be completely cured.

283
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,360
Slowly.

284
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,080
Don't worry. Professor Hu said it's just a small surgery to...

285
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,530
...remove the item.

286
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,640
Is it a small surgery to remove something from the brain?

287
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,640
That's enough. What are you saying?

288
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,280
Don't worry,Xiaorui.

289
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,050
Even if the surgery fails,we will be by your side.

290
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,240
Shut up! -Shut up!

291
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,050
Don't worry.

292
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,320
When you open your eyes again,...

293
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,930
...the first one you will see is me.

294
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,880
Go in without any worries. I'll wait for you.

295
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,680
Don't worry. My sight will return to normal after this.

296
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,760
I have decided.

297
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,720
I'll become a new and healthy Zhuang Rui...

298
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,970
...and return to your side.

299
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,160
Hello,Nakagawa.

300
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,840
Don't worry. He has entered the operation room.

301
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,440
I just came out from the hospital. Ma Tengfeng's ward is empty.

302
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,600
What did you say? Ma Tengfeng's...

303
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,760
...ward is empty?

304
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,480
According to my investigation,...

305
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,640
...he left yesterday morning.

306
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,480
Sure,okay.

307
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,800
Ma Tengfeng has been taken away.

308
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,360
Uncle De,your wish will soon come true.

309
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,600
Come back. Let me see it.

310
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,420
Hurry and send the blood bags! Quick!

311
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,360
Hello,the surgery is not successful.

312
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,000
Don't worry,I'll bring the stone back.

313
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:35,000
All criminals were brought to justice.Cultural relics were retrieved. Uncle De escaped and wasn't found.
