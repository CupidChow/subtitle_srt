00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,000
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 35

3
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,680
Feifei,you.....

4
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,640
It's a cool thing to do...

5
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,320
...and you look good together with her. Why didn't you go?

6
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,759
Please don't say that. Now I have to go to the room.

7
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,440
I have something important to do. Wait for me here.

8
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,160
I'll be back soon.

9
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,520
What's going on?

10
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,079
Didn't he ask me to stay here?

11
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,010
Why did he ask me to go upstairs?

12
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:00,980
Zhuang Rui.

13
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,560
Zhuang Rui.

14
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,720
Zhuang Rui.

15
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,360
It's me.

16
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,610
What's the matter with you?

17
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,960
Come on. This way.

18
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,880
I missed the part where you blew out the candles...

19
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,300
...on your birthday cake yesterday.

20
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,760
So I bought another cake to celebrate with you...

21
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,100
...and for you to blow out the candles again.

22
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,640
You missed it. What's the point of doing it again?

23
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,560
You're wrong.

24
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,480
The moon on the 16th day of the month is as round as the 15th day.

25
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,480
Isn't that right?

26
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,760
Feifei,ever since I met you,...

27
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,640
...we've been through a lot. You've been helping us.

28
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:42,440
You've been helping, as well as saving me.

29
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,640
Therefore,I treat you as a very good friend.

30
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,840
You're a friend that I treasure a lot.

31
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,480
I hope our friendship...

32
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,240
...can last forever and remain pure.

33
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,400
This candle is ugly.

34
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,220
It's even worse than the candle we use during blackout.

35
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,250
Does the candle matter?

36
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,560
I've searched the entire ball and only found this.

37
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,890
Well,it comes with great meaning.

38
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,680
I wish you good health and may everything goes well for you.

39
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,090
Happy birthday.

40
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,520
Come on. Make a wish.

41
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,010
Are you done?

42
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,880
This cake...

43
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,380
...is seriously ugly.

44
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,200
Three. Two. One.

45
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,400
Happy birthday!

46
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,160
Thank you.

47
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,720
By the way,...

48
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,520
...I have something important to tell you.

49
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,000
Happy birthday! -Zhuang Rui!

50
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,680
Just send me the photo.

51
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,850
You don't have to come all the way here.

52
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,640
It's important to come here personally to honour my promise.

53
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,880
Do you seriously want to know...

54
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,450
...what happened to Feng Quan in the second half of his life?

55
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,760
If you didn't take away my stuff,...

56
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,410
...I would've known it a long time ago.

57
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,040
Feng Quan...

58
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,600
...had been enjoying great wealth.

59
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,360
He had a rare gift,...

60
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,770
...a pair of eyes that could tell everything.

61
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,880
However,things went south later.

62
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,520
He fell sick suddenly...

63
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,440
...and lost all five senses. He's almost mad...

64
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
...and even.....

65
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,720
I know.

66
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,960
I do.

67
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,640
I've honoured my promise.

68
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,760
I've given him the stuff. -How did he react?

69
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,280
He's calm.

70
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,730
You can tell whether one is courageous in moments of crisis.

71
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,960
He has great potential. What a pity.

72
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,880
Continue to monitor him closely.

73
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,040
Yes,father.

74
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,370
Grandfather Gu?

75
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,480
Hello. -Hello,Xiaorui.

76
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,560
Let's meet up. I have something to tell you.

77
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,290
Yes,it'll be just the two of us.

78
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,120
All right,see you later.

79
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,440
Grandfather.

80
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You didn't work hard enough. You promised me you'd join me,...

81
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,200
...yet you've been talking to Xiaorui on the phone.

82
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,800
I've already lost three rounds. -Listen to yourself.

83
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,360
Without me,you can't win at all.

84
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,680
I'm a weak player. Of course I need help.

85
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,120
Fine,I'll join you for a round and win it for you.

86
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,080
You're getting more childish as days go by.

87
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,290
You're back to being a kid and can't even be apart from me.

88
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,890
I only talked to Xiaorui for a while...

89
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,160
...and you..... -Grandfather,what's the matter?

90
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,440
Why do you have to speak to Xiaorui in my absence?

91
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,380
We've been sharing secrets for 20 years.

92
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,160
Aren't you tired of that? -Grandfather,let me ask you.

93
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,920
I'm your grandson yet you're closer to Xiaorui.

94
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,760
I think he's here to seize power and claim my inheritance.

95
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,720
Be it you or him,...

96
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,840
...both of you are my good grandsons.

97
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,560
Come on. Display your second skill.

98
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:54,960
Sure.

99
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,080
Grandfather,honestly,Xiaorui is better than me in certain aspects.

100
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,760
However,you're biased. I'm vulnerable,you know?

101
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,080
Yes,you're vulnerable in this game.

102
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,360
Come on. Hurry up. Are you hiding?

103
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,320
Fine,I'll take it seriously this time.

104
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,160
See,I've been saving you for countless times,...

105
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,130
...yet you claimed I favour Xiaorui. Where's your conscience?

106
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm just jealous.

107
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,320
You grew up alone.

108
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,640
How I wish you had a sibling.

109
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,600
Then when I'm gone,...

110
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,120
...I can rest in peace. -Stop it.

111
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,160
What are you talking about?

112
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,760
Hurry up. Hit the woods. -No. What are you doing?

113
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,960
What are you talking about? -Stop pulling me.

114
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,080
Game over. -This.....

115
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,560
Look at this kid. -Forget about the game.

116
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,480
Even you can't save me. It's not a good day for games.

117
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,680
Look at you. You even need help to play a game.

118
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,200
If you don't have any reliable pal in life,...

119
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,800
...I won't rest easy.

120
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,640
Xiaorui is young and capable. He doesn't need me.

121
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,520
That's not true.

122
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,920
Xiaorui's grandfather and I were the best of friends.

123
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,000
We could share almost everything.

124
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,320
You have no idea how delighted I was when I realised...

125
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
...Xiaorui was Qiming's grandson.

126
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,850
I'll be honest with you.

127
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,320
I've been thinking about my days...

128
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,280
...with Xiaorui's grandfather lately.

129
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,800
That's why I want to meet Xiaorui,...

130
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,380
...understand? -Yes,grandfather.

131
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,960
Feel free to chat. I'm not that petty.

132
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,280
Feel free...

133
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,040
...to chat with him. However,...

134
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,100
...please don't share any secret skills with Xiaorui.

135
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,640
Come on,I'm not Huang Yaoshi,okay?

136
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,840
You little brat. -What if I become stupid?

137
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,560
You hit me. Sorry,grandfather.

138
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,640
Even if you turn stupid, I still have Zhuang Rui.

139
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,680
I'll tickle you. Aren't you scared?

140
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,680
I'm going to do it.

141
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,640
Do you see it? It's an ambush.

142
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,880
Eagle Claw. Iron cloth. -Watch out.

143
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,040
The black tiger goes for the heart.

144
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,680
You're brilliant.

145
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,560
It's painful.

146
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,620
Grandfather Gu. -You're here. Sit down.

147
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,920
Sorry for being late by 10 minutes. There's a traffic jam.

148
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,440
It's all right. I've just arrived. -Thanks.

149
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,200
Grandfather Gu,what do you want to tell me?

150
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,720
Actually,I've been wanting to talk to you.

151
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,370
Please go ahead.

152
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,260
Ever since you entered the jade industry...

153
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,580
...and achieved success,...

154
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,040
...do you start having problems with your health?

155
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,000
Are you talking about what happened in Inner Mongolia?

156
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,560
That's temporary. I'm fine now.

157
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,400
I will tell you this,Xiaorui.

158
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,400
Like Xiaoyu,I treat you as my own grandson.

159
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,200
So,please be honest...

160
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,680
...and tell me what's going on with your health.

161
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,480
I'm fine. I've recovered. Look.

162
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,530
Then your eyes.....

163
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,600
Xiaorui,please wait for me here. I'll be back shortly.

164
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,360
I'll join you. -It's all right. Just wait here.

165
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,600
I have nothing to do here.

166
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,680
Xiaorui,remember,...

167
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,480
...no matter what happens, I'll always protect you.

168
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,480
Hello,Feifei. -Hello.

169
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,410
I'm not done yet. Grandfather Gu went out.

170
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,730
I'm already downstairs. -What? You're downstairs?

171
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,640
It's all right. Take your time. I'll just wait for you nearby.

172
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,420
Excuse me.....

173
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,900
Someone is dead! Get someone in here!

174
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,280
What's going on? Who's dead?

175
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,480
Someone is dead. -Who was it?

176
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,400
It's an old man. -Is it Mr. Gu?

177
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,760
Who was it? -It's scary.

178
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,440
That's Mr. Gu. -No idea. I've never served him.

179
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:20,720
Why did he go in? -What is he doing here?

180
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,310
Why did he go in?

181
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,400
Grandfather Gu. Grandfather Gu!

182
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,120
Grandfather Gu!

183
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,960
Call an ambulance! Grandfather Gu!

184
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,040
Grandfather Gu! -Zhuang Rui!

185
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,200
Please calm down. I'll contact my colleague.

186
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,080
Call an ambulance! -Just now he.....

187
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,600
Just now he told you he's going out,right?

188
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,130
Do you have any idea who he's supposed to meet?

189
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,080
Hello,Zhao.

190
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,740
Zhuang Rui!

191
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,120
Nakagawa Ryosuke.

192
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,560
Nakagawa Ryosuke?

193
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,320
Hello,Mr. Zhuang.

194
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm Nakagawa Ryosuke from Nakagawa Corporation.

195
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,840
I met him at the ball yesterday. He's a Japanese businessman.

196
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:46,080
The jade eyes that were damaged in the robbery at the pawn shop...

197
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,210
...was owned by Nakagawa Ryosuke.

198
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,200
What's the reason? Why did he do this?

199
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,000
I don't get it.

200
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,320
That's not right.

201
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,600
Why would the killer leave behind an obvious evidence like this?

202
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,840
Mr. Nakagawa,everything is ready. We have to leave now.

203
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,370
Let's go.

204
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,480
Hello,Feifei, you finally look for me.

205
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,530
Is my grandfather gone?

206
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,340
I see him whenever I close my eyes.

207
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,850
He's always playing games on the sofa.

208
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,560
Whenever he lost,...

209
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,050
...he pinched my ears and convinced me to play again.

210
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,600
Is he really gone?

211
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,680
I just don't get it.

212
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,370
Why did this happen?

213
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,960
Yes,my grandfather was old.

214
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,920
I knew he'd leave me one day.

215
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,240
You know what?

216
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,360
I've thought of different possibilities.

217
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,480
Perhaps he'd meet with an accident or fall sick.

218
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,200
It never once occurred to me...

219
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,240
...that his life would end this way.

220
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,880
Who do you think killed my grandfather?

221
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,880
Xiaoyu,don't worry.

222
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,260
I'll surely bring Grandfather Gu's killer to justice.

223
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,400
I just don't get how it happened.

224
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,680
If I knew this, I'd have joined him.

225
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,500
I'd have gone to the restaurant with him.

226
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:22,960
Xiaoyu.

227
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,490
I'm sorry...

228
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,090
...for not being able to protect Grandfather Gu.

229
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,850
I shouldn't have let him go by himself.

230
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,940
If I sensed it earlier,...

231
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,930
...even if it's just a minute earlier,...

232
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,040
...Grandfather Gu might not have died.

233
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,000
You know what?

234
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,520
I regret it a lot.

235
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,760
I regret not making my grandfather angry more often.

236
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,220
If I did,he would have hit or scolded me more.

237
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,360
Now he's gone.

238
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,210
I won't be able to get that anymore.

239
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:24,160
Xiaoyu,this already happened. You must stay strong.

240
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,900
How did Grandfather Gu teach you?

241
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,480
Gu Dingyu,...

242
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,640
...chin up and be a man.

243
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,120
That's right.

244
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,600
I must man up.

245
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,450
Before we identify the killer,...

246
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,840
...I mustn't give up.

247
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,840
It's the other half of Grandfather Gu's jade pendant.

248
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,040
When I first met Grandfather Gu in Panjiayuan,...

249
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,740
...he helped me and Xiaoyun to seek justice.

250
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,760
That's the first time I saw this jade pendant.

251
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:37,120
That's how we got to know each other better.

252
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,280
Grandfather Gu was my grandfather's best friend.

253
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,720
He's been a loyal friend.

254
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,800
Since the token of their friendship is now with us,...

255
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,690
...starting today,...

256
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,050
...we shall be sworn brothers.

257
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:10,920
Miss.

258
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,160
How is it? Did they find the killer?

259
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,640
No,miss,the police is still investigating it.

260
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,040
There's been no news yet.

261
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:25,000
Why did it happen to Mr. Gu?

262
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,600
He was fine at the ball.

263
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,840
There's something fishy about the incident.

264
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,700
I heard Mr. Gu was with Zhuang Rui at the restaurant.

265
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,080
Zhuang Rui was upstairs when Mr. Gu was killed downstairs.

266
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,840
However,he didn't sense anything.

267
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,440
How's Zhuang Rui now? -Now?

268
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,840
He's fine. He's with the female cop all the time.

269
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,090
He's perfectly fine. Don't worry.

270
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,400
All right.

271
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,920
Continue to investigate it and let me know if you find anything.

272
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,780
Mr. Gu was not his usual self. -That's right.

273
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,920
He remembered certain things about Zhuang Rui's grandfather.

274
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,250
He wanted to speak to him alone.

275
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,100
Did he tell you what was it?

276
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,960
Grandfather said that? -Yes.

277
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:49,400
I was late by 10 minutes. We didn't talk much.

278
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,360
Before we even talked about my grandfather,...

279
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,560
...he received a text message and left.

280
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,960
The police took the text seriously and looked for Nakagawa Ryosuke.

281
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,010
However,it's too late.

282
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,400
The police in Yunnan are still looking for him.

283
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,360
However,...

284
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:17,400
...I don't think Nakagawa Ryosuke is the killer...

285
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,420
...of Grandfather Gu. -What do you mean?

286
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,840
The motive.

287
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,360
What motive did he have...

288
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,890
...to kill Grandfather Gu in such a cruel way?

289
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,480
Had Grandfather Gu ever mentioned this person to you?

290
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,120
No,I met him for the first time at the ball.

291
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,480
Did he act weirdly?

292
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,280
Actually,you and I...

293
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,490
...have a lot to do with each other.

294
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,800
I'm happy to see your achievement today.

295
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,690
I'm not sure about that. However,he said that...

296
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,680
...he's happy about my achievement today.

297
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,040
He owned the jade eyes in the robbery of the pawn shop.

298
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,680
Was he talking about that?

299
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,970
Even if he knew my link to the jade eyes,...

300
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,490
...what did it have to do with Grandfather Gu?

301
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,600
I found this in my grandfather's suitcase.

302
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,960
It's the letter between the archeological team.

303
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,620
My grandfather treasured it.

304
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,850
Since it's written by your grandfather,you should keep it.

305
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,640
"Brother Tianfeng,writing this letter is like meeting you.

306
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,300
All archeological team members arrived at their spots recently.

307
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,610
We started working.

308
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,200
We found a tomb here.

309
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,000
Luckily,it's rather intact.

310
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,610
We dug out many funerary objects of great historical value.

311
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,360
Strangely,...

312
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,240
...most of the items carry the totem of eye pattern.

313
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,440
When we tried to get deeper into the tomb to study it,...

314
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,840
...we met with one after another accident.

315
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,680
Many of our members are affected. It's a critical situation.

316
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,040
After the accidents,...

317
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,360
...our teammate,Nakagawa Yohei's body underwent changes.

318
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,020
The situation became tricky.

319
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,200
He's constantly tortured by continuous headache,tinnitus,...

320
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,130
...dizziness and other symptoms.

321
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,080
Lately,he lost his five senses...

322
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,000
...and lost control.

323
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,560
He keeps having hallucinations...

324
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,410
...and can't tell apart reality and fantasy.

325
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,560
Today,Nakagawa...

326
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,560
...started to attack and hurt others.

327
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,720
He accidentally hurt me multiple times.

328
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,280
I'm Qiming.

329
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,080
Nakagawa!

330
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,160
Nakagawa!

331
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,540
There're a lot of things that are fishy about this tour.

332
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,820
I'll talk to you when I return to Beijing.

333
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,520
Brother Tianfeng,please don't tell this to my family.

334
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,760
I don't want them to be involved in this.

335
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,520
If I don't return on time,...

336
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,320
...I hereby entrust my family to you.

337
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,360
Wish you good luck, Zhuang Qiming."

338
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,540
My grandfather and Nakagawa Yohei were members...

339
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,320
...of the archeological team. -Nakagawa?

340
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,120
Nakagawa Yohei. Nakagawa Ryosuke.

341
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,640
What's their relationship?

342
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,640
When Grandfather Gu received his last text message,...

343
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,300
...I saw the information about the archeological team back then.

344
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,250
So I'm wondering...

345
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,240
...whether the truth of the accident in Gansu...

346
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,760
...had anything to do with my grandfather's disappearance.

347
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,280
Grandfather Gu must have found something. So he's killed.

348
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,240
Hello,Zhao.

349
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,330
Did you get anything on Nakagawa Ryosuke?

350
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,920
Nakagawa Ryosuke is the boss of Nakagawa Corporation in Japan.

351
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,760
His business covers different industries.

352
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,160
However,he doesn't seem to have any collaboration with China.

353
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,480
The number the text was sent from was a temporary number.

354
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,810
We can't find anything.

355
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,720
However,we found that he has a private jet.

356
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,200
We need time to get his flight record.

357
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,680
All right,continue to investigate two things.

358
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:29,080
Firstly,check for Nakagawa Ryohei in Nakagawa Ryosuke's family.

359
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:32,520
Then find out if these two had anything with Grandfather Gu.

360
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,290
Understood.

361
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,370
Zhuang Rui,what's wrong with you?

362
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,540
Zhuang Rui.

363
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,160
I'm not kidding you. Who are you?

364
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,720
Zhuang Rui, can't you see anything?

365
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,260
Zhuang Rui.

366
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,000
Zhuang Rui! -What's wrong?

367
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,600
What's wrong with you? -What's wrong with you?

368
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,320
It's painful. I'm having a nasty headache.

369
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,800
Hold him. -Yes.

370
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,120
Who cooked this? It's salty.

371
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,440
Who else?

372
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,600
That guy said Zhuang Rui is back. We need to welcome him.

373
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:32,360
So he cooked a lot. -Do you have to waste your salt?

374
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:41,570
I accidentally used a little too much salt just now.

375
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,710
A little? It's so salty.

376
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,560
I'm a beginner. Of course I'm not great.

377
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,580
I'll work hard to improve my culinary skills...

378
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,960
...and cook tasty dishes for you. -Forget about that.

379
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,280
Look,Xiaorui likes it,right?

380
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,340
Don't force yourself to eat it. Too much salt is unhealthy.

381
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,680
It's not bad. It's just slightly bland.

382
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,240
Bland?

383
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,720
What's wrong with your taste buds? -Xiaorui.

384
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,880
You're weird today.

385
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,120
Normally you make fun of the dishes I make.

386
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,120
Honestly,even I myself...

387
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,210
...think these dishes are bad.

388
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,520
No,it's as usual. It's quite good.

389
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,680
Xiaorui,stop trying to please him.

390
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,460
I won't be able to take it if his passion in cooking deepens.

391
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,680
I should cherish each meal Xiaoyun cooks for me.

392
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,400
Listen to yourself. I can cook for you everyday.

393
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,280
Xiaojia doesn't like it anyway.

394
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,040
I'll get some wine. -I'll go.

395
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,730
Didn't you say wine is bad? Why do you feel like drinking now?

396
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,180
We're all together today. Let's celebrate.

397
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,440
A lot has happened lately. There's nothing to celebrate.

398
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,520
Xiaorui,we understand how you feel.

399
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,330
However,the deceased is gone.

400
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,680
Feel free to share your sorrow with us.

401
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,520
It'll make you feel better. -That's right.

402
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,040
Don't bottle up your feelings.

403
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,000
That's right.

404
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,540
Grandfather Gu...

405
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,760
...wouldn't want to see you like this either.

406
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,200
Now I understand.

407
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,400
Everyone dies sooner or later.

408
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,780
I'll just leave it to fate.

409
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,720
Don't be pessimistic.

410
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,240
Life is still beautiful. Look,...

411
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,600
...we have family,friends,...

412
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,960
...lovers and most importantly,money.

413
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,520
Consider ourselves blessed. Come on,cheers.

414
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,480
Xiaoyun.

415
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,600
We formed Ruiyunzhai together,...

416
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,060
...yet I never have the time to manage it.

417
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,250
I'm relieved...

418
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,880
...to hand it over to you.

419
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,360
With your reputation,it's hard...

420
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,960
...for a sleeping partner like me...

421
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,800
...to ruin it. -You're kind.

422
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,440
Xiaojia.

423
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,850
Though you can be mean at times,...

424
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,600
...I know you're kind-hearted.

425
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,620
Your bark is worse than your bite.

426
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:20,000
Your true love for Xiaoyun moves me.

427
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:25,280
Thanks for staying by his side. I wish you everlasting happiness.

428
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,600
You're kind.

429
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,080
Who would want to be with him? You're his true partner,...

430
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,500
...am I right,Feifei?

431
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,440
Xiaofei.

432
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,450
We've been through thick and thin.

433
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,370
You've been protecting me.

434
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,560
Thank you.

435
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,640
Just stay here in the future.

436
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,260
If there're excess rooms,...

437
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,930
...be a landlord and rent them out.

438
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,320
You pay me a monthly salary. I don't need a side job.

439
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:16,980
You're so kind.

440
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,120
Feifei.

441
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,140
You're so kind.

442
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,720
Though I make you angry all the time,...

443
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,280
...you step forward whenever I'm in danger.

444
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,160
So,thank you.

445
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,080
Zhuang Rui,you're drunk. Stop drinking.

446
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,880
Stop drinking or you might start talking about your last wishes.

447
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,050
I mean all I've said.

448
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,450
I'll bring you back to rest.

449
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,040
Come on. -Go on.

450
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,330
What did you experience in Yunnan?

451
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,880
Why is he acting this way?

452
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,800
Perhaps he's badly affected by Grandfather Gu's death.

453
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,280
Indeed. Grandfather Gu was kind to Xiaorui.

454
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,810
If I were him,I wouldn't be able to take it either.

455
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,090
Let's take our time to comfort him.

456
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,520
Xiaorui,wake up.

457
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:29,360
What's the deal with this photo?
