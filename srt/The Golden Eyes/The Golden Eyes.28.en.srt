1
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,000
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,500
Episode 28

3
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,720
Xiaoyun,you'll study the routes taken by the guards...

4
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,200
...and sneak into the storage room.

5
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,320
You will cause a distraction to draw them over there.

6
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,520
When your mission is completed, go and save Pengfei.

7
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,440
Zhuang Rui and I will handle Du Wa.

8
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,900
When this is over, we will gather at the base.

9
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,720
They're putting fireworks.

10
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,960
Come out!

11
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,200
Come out!

12
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,530
You're all here.

13
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:01,000
Come on. Join me!

14
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,280
Jiang Ge, why do you only come now?

15
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,440
Xiaofei. -Xiaoyun?

16
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,800
How did you get here? What happened out there?

17
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,860
A conflict broke out with Du Wa's men. The base in chaos.

18
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,610
I'm here to save you.

19
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,159
What do you think? Do I look cool?

20
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,920
Let's go. -You have yet to answer me.

21
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,880
Do I look cool? -You look cool.

22
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,120
Watch out!

23
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,680
Come on,let's dance. Come on!

24
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,360
What are you doing? -What does it look like I'm doing?

25
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,960
How dare you? I made you into who you are today.

26
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,880
Brother, you can't say it like that.

27
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,040
You're right,I wouldn't be here if it weren't for you.

28
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,600
However,if I wasn't here, how will you go to the afterlife?

29
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,600
You wouldn't dare. -No small talk before killing.

30
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,280
Brother, I learned this from you.

31
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,010
You also said...

32
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,080
...that one lives only for today. -Brother!

33
00:05:56,159 --> 00:06:10,400
Come on.

34
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,960
What did you say about our group?

35
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,960
Brother,didn't you say...

36
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,600
...that you'll let us go?

37
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,400
Little girl, I didn't want to say this...

38
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,320
...but women are indeed simple-minded beings.

39
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,690
What do you mean?

40
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,300
I don't have a plan yet.

41
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,000
Don't worry. I will think of something soon.

42
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,159
Before that,...

43
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,920
...I will keep the two of you hostage.

44
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,240
You! -Did I say anything wrong?

45
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,159
I don't even know your true identity.

46
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,920
I deal with A'Kun.

47
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,120
Are you A'Kun?

48
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,440
Move!

49
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,320
Xiaoyun! Xiaofei!

50
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,560
Xiaorui! -Pengfei.

51
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,360
Wang Mazi don't even know who you are.

52
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,360
You did all that trouble...

53
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:34,920
...just for this man?

54
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,840
I don't understand.

55
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,720
My brothers!

56
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,690
These are the people...

57
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,920
...who blew up our storage and killed Big Brother.

58
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,920
I will avenge Big Brother today!

59
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:30,560
Avenge Big Brother! Avenge Big Brother! Avenge Big Brother! Avenge Big Brother!

60
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,210
Leave her alone.

61
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,480
We have a hero here. You first! -Do it!

62
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:42,960
You can't kill him! He is useful to you.

63
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,000
How is Wenwen doing? -You asked me to talk to her.

64
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,940
She's feeling better now.

65
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,480
I want to meet her. Tell her I've changed my mind.

66
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:02,960
Yes,madam.

67
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,280
Mission abort. You have to bring Zhuang Rui back safely.

68
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,130
They've created trouble. Even if it's not us,...

69
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,920
...someone else will kill them. -All right,I understand.

70
00:09:34,920 --> 00:10:00,400
Mother,did anything happen?

71
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,360
They are embroiled in a conflict with drug traffickers.

72
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,660
Drug traffickers?

73
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,640
Mother,you have to save Zhuang Rui.

74
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,600
These drug traffickers are ruthless men.

75
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,520
This is a line that we can't afford to cross.

76
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,500
Mother,do you remember what you told me?

77
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,320
When I was younger,you said that in doing business,...

78
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,840
...loyalty is of utmost importance.

79
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,530
Zhuang Rui went inside Bo Gang's casino to save me...

80
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,290
...and Feifei had gotten injured.

81
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,880
If they can do that for us, why can't we do the same?

82
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,320
Mother!

83
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,600
I will do it on my own.

84
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,280
Don't stop me! -All right.

85
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,140
I'll think of a way.

86
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,840
However,his survival ultimately depends on him.

87
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,920
This is your final chance. Tell me.

88
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,640
I can see what you cannot see.

89
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,620
You won't find the treasures just by looking at the map.

90
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,380
We have heard about the Japanese's treasures for years...

91
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,300
...but no one has ever seen it.

92
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,330
You're telling me that you can see what we cannot see.

93
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,730
That's interesting...

94
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,960
...but how will you prove it?

95
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,240
You used tattoos to conceal your scars.

96
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,480
It must have been scars from when you were young.

97
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,490
Shut your mouth!

98
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,800
Did you become a drug lord because your father abused you?

99
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,000
You shut your mouth!

100
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,760
Watch the other three.

101
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,760
If you lie to me, I will kill them!

102
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,770
Release him. -Okay.

103
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,680
Why are we stopping?

104
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,480
The reason...

105
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,720
...we couldn't find the treasures using the map...

106
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,720
...is because...

107
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,840
...this is an incomplete treasure map.

108
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,240
We have been following all the clues on the treasure map...

109
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,680
...to look for the treasures...

110
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,080
...but the map doesn't go further than this place.

111
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,810
Are you saying that this treasure map is useless?

112
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,920
It may be useless to you but I can certainly find it.

113
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,880
You can? How will you do it?

114
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:03,000
There is a round rock underneath some plants 20 m ahead.

115
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,810
There is a "xi" word written on top.

116
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,620
How can there be a round rock here?

117
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,490
You can't see it now. As a long time has passed,...

118
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,260
...the rock has been covered by vegetation.

119
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,410
Tell your men to cut some branches.

120
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,330
Check it out!

121
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,800
"Xi" in Japanese means river.

122
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,560
From this carved word, it means that...

123
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,200
...our next step is to move along the stream.

124
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,240
I notice that there are pebbles here.

125
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:12,349
Where there are pebbles, there will be a streaming river.

126
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,220
We will find it as long as we look out for pebbles.

127
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,960
Nonsense! I have been here for years...

128
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,760
...and never seen a river. You played me!

129
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:30,720
Brother! We found the stone and there is the carved word.

130
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,400
Why do you think Jiang Ge...

131
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,500
...agreed to work with us all of a sudden?

132
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,560
Besides,he only took Zhuang Rui. Is this a trap?

133
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,280
I'm worried,too.

134
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,600
Is Zhuang Rui taken there to be buried alive?

135
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,520
I have an idea.

136
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,240
Brother!

137
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,690
Behave yourselves!

138
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,730
Brother,...

139
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,200
...I just feel like I need to remind you.

140
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,900
You should be clear of what's in front of you.

141
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,920
What's in front of me?

142
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,760
The saying goes,after the cunning hare is killed,...

143
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,850
...the hound is boiled.

144
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,420
Say something that I understand!

145
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,840
I'll do it. Brother, I'm telling you the truth.

146
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,760
Looking at your capability,...

147
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:26,880
...position or your style, you have it all,don't you?

148
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,420
However,why are they looking for the treasures...

149
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,920
...and you're left here in this old house?

150
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,960
It's because you are Du Wa's man.

151
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,440
Nonsense! Brother Jiang Ge..... -Listen to yourself.

152
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,680
You keep calling him Brother Jiang Ge.

153
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,050
You see him as a brother but what does he see you as?

154
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,440
You're a tool,just like the gun in your hand.

155
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,220
Du Wa has just died so Jiang Ge has yet to do anything.

156
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,600
However,once they have retrieved the treasures,...

157
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,460
...do you really think that he will keep you around?

158
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,680
You really think that he would share the treasures with you?

159
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,040
Exactly! -When he killed Du Wa,...

160
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,450
...where was the brotherhood?

161
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,380
Where money is concerned,...

162
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,100
...no one can be trusted. -No one can be trusted.

163
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,120
Someone!

164
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,200
Jiang Ge may have betrayed Brother Du Wa.

165
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,440
Go check it out. -I will.

166
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,600
Good job.

167
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,000
What is it now?

168
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,200
The entrance is right there.

169
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,040
Where is it? Why don't I see it?

170
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,010
It's hidden behind the vegetation's.

171
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,010
Let's go!

172
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,690
Leader, there is an entrance here!

173
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,720
Check it out. -Okay.

174
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,600
Let's go.

175
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,220
There are treasures,indeed!

176
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,380
Young man,I'm impressed.

177
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:11,920
Go for it!

178
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,400
Look at all these gold.

179
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,840
Brother,Jiang Ge has betrayed Brother Du Wa!

180
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,520
How could I not see this coming?

181
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,120
Brother,this is your chance to make things right!

182
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,320
Let's go!

183
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,760
No! Please untie me first! Brother!

184
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,760
I can't believe this!

185
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,560
I wouldn't have wasted my breath if I had known. Let's go.

186
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,960
Hurry.

187
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,400
Search thoroughly. See if there's anything else.

188
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,120
Give it to me. Now!

189
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,600
Brother!

190
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,920
Brother! There are many people outside!

191
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,250
Who are they? -I don't know.

192
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,000
Brothers,let's go!

193
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,820
Brother,the entrance is there! -Go after them!

194
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:48,960
Open fire!

195
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,400
Zang Bian,you rebel! Keep shooting!

196
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,640
Xiao Rui! Let's go.

197
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,680
Xiao Rui!

198
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,720
How did all of you escape?

199
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,760
Jiang Ge's men knew about the treasure...

200
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,320
...and rebelled. -Xiaorui,are there treasures?

201
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,320
There is gold inside.

202
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,280
Xiaorui! -Feifei!

203
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,280
Zhuang Rui,you could've died! -Xiaorui.

204
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,240
What is it?

205
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,660
Be careful. Hold your breath.

206
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:42,720
Xiaorui.

207
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,840
Up! Left! Go left!

208
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,450
How can my gun be defeated with knives?

209
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,680
What's wrong with this game? Attack him!

210
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,600
Why did you get up?

211
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,920
Did you have a nightmare? Have a seat.

212
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,560
My ears are ringing.

213
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,320
What did the doctor say earlier?

214
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:35,600
The shock to your system and the environment in Myanmar...

215
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,960
...may have given you an infection.

216
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,400
It's nothing serious. You'll be fine after some rest.

217
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,080
Do you need to go to the hospital?

218
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,080
Stop looking around.

219
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,730
What are you looking for? You're always looking for things.

220
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,600
I've looked into your suitcase. There's nothing there.

221
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I've never seen so much gold in my life...

222
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,250
...and yet I brought none back. Forget it.

223
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:41,360
It's a good thing Dama arrived in time to saved us.

224
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,880
Dama saved us? -Yes.

225
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,600
Hu Wen forced her mother to change her plans.

226
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,570
Where are you going?

227
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,440
Where are you going? -I need some fresh air.

228
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,760
Put on your coat. I'll go with you.

229
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,000
No,I want to be alone. -All right.

230
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,800
Looking the current situation,...

231
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,120
...it's getting more questionable but it's also coming together.

232
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:26,600
The next step is to collect evidence.

233
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,320
We can't rush it. These suspects...

234
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,620
..are professionals.

235
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,200
They have never left any traces behind.

236
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,080
No matter what, your hunch was right.

237
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,280
This is a huge case.

238
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,080
However,it will be difficult to take any substantial actions.

239
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,330
Their operations are spread across many countries.

240
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,920
Officer Ting,it is difficult to collect and sort out all evidence.

241
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,640
Would you be interested if it were easy?

242
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,160
Miao Feifei! -Present!

243
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,560
You have accomplished your given task.

244
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,220
I now order you to return to your team.

245
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,860
Start a full investigation and follow-up on this case.

246
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,240
Yes!

247
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,840
How are you feeling?

248
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,520
I have a question for you.

249
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,410
The person you are investigating,...

250
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,460
...is it Qin Xuanbing?

251
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,100
Did you come with me to Myanmar...

252
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,320
...for her?

253
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,560
Did you follow me around just for her?

254
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,050
Is that true?

255
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,360
What if it's true?

256
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,740
I have no evidence anyway so I can't capture her.

257
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,440
Zhuang Rui,when will you see things clearly?

258
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,540
When you were in danger, when is Qin Xuanbing not involved?

259
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,080
For your own sake,...

260
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,940
...think about who she really is.

261
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,640
It's getting late. You're not asleep yet?

262
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,640
Yes,I can't fall asleep.

263
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,880
Why are you going to the Northwest? Where is it?

264
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,020
It's a small place.

265
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:03,040
Hello. -Zhuang Rui! Are you all right?

266
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,480
They want my father to disguise jade stones and antiquities...

267
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,490
...as natural stones and export them for profit.

268
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,200
They are smuggling goods. -Yes.

269
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,680
This is not the first time we're being coerced.
