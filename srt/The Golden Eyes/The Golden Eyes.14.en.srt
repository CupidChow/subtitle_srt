1
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,000
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Episode 14

3
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,930
My goodness!

4
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,800
It's red!

5
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,000
It's all red! He's so lucky!

6
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,280
If it's a bangle,it would cost RMB 1 million!

7
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,320
My goodness!

8
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,200
We've made a fortune. We have the Midas touch.

9
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,480
We've finally become lucky!

10
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,280
Father,Zhuang Rui's stone is a red jade.

11
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,840
If we buy it,we don't have to...

12
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,680
...worry about materials for few years.

13
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,400
Buy it.

14
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,120
What about Jade No. 0?

15
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,400
I trust your judgement. Go ahead.

16
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,079
Alright,I got it.

17
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:54,480
Mr. Xu,it looks great.

18
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,240
Great.

19
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,740
Congratulations!

20
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,120
Brother,sell the stone to me.

21
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,880
I'll give you RMB 30 million.

22
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,880
Wang,your stall is small.

23
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,600
Why don't you give it to me?

24
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,800
I'll give you RMB 35 million.

25
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,720
I'll give you RMB 40 million!

26
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,120
Xu Jewellery will offer you RMB 70 million.

27
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,560
What a great price!

28
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
It's a small case.

29
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,340
We won't sell it to you.

30
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,400
I shall not talk to you. You can't make the decision,too.

31
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,040
Ask Zhuang Rui about it.

32
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,320
He's smart. We're businessmen.

33
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,260
Who doesn't want to earn more?

34
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,440
I'm sorry. The stone has nothing to do with Zhuang Rui.

35
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,440
My brother and I bought it.

36
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,420
Why don't you make a decision?

37
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,200
The jade doesn't suit you.

38
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,240
It's only a red jade.

39
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,640
Keep your money and make the highest bid.

40
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,000
I thought you're smart.

41
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,079
Since when are you same with him?

42
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,320
It's a large piece of jade.

43
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,320
How many people can afford to buy it?

44
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,970
Think before you answer me.

45
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,600
Brother Ma,it's upside down.

46
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,480
Sure.

47
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,920
Sure,alright then.

48
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,240
Stop fighting,everyone.

49
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,040
My friend wants it.

50
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,540
I have to keep it for my friend.

51
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,960
Bingbing. -She's from Xi Huang Jewellery.

52
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,240
Thank you,Mr. Ma.

53
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,760
We're very interested in this jade.

54
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,650
We'll offer you RMB 80 million.

55
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,040
It's indeed Xi Huang Jewellery. They've offered RMB 80 million.

56
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,640
It's a big sum of money.

57
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,680
Okay.

58
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,180
RMB 80 million.

59
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,360
Thank you,Brother Ma. -You don't have to thank me.

60
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,560
You should know who he is.

61
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,960
Uncle,Xi Huang Jewellery bought the jade with RMB 80 million.

62
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,320
It seems that Qin Bingbing is close to Zhuang Rui.

63
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,400
You were too impatient.

64
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,360
The red jade is rare,...

65
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,370
...would there be no buyer? You offered to buy...

66
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,090
...at the wrong timing.

67
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,560
Yes,I just couldn't stand them being proud.

68
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,600
I was too reckless.

69
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,800
Have you confirmed the situation of Jade No. 0?

70
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,880
No worries,it has been confirmed.

71
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,920
Let me announce the price of the last bid.

72
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,720
As we all know,...

73
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,040
...the last bid is always the highest bid.

74
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,360
Jade No. 0 is sold at RMB 92 million and...

75
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,480
...has become the highest bid of today.

76
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,880
Let us congratulate Buyer No. 62.

77
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,160
Thank you for helping us all the while.

78
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,600
I always bear it in mind.

79
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,400
I'll continue abiding the professional ethics...

80
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,520
...to serve my colleagues...

81
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,800
...and the customers better.

82
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,960
We've decided to cut the jade on the spot...

83
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,520
...for everyone to admire its beauty and...

84
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,960
...let the auction end successfully.

85
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,240
Thank you.

86
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,000
Mr. Xu Wei.

87
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,520
I'm Inspector Miao Feifei.

88
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,040
You're suspected to be involved in commercial fraud,...

89
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,240
...malignant completion and bribing.

90
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,970
Please follow me for further investigation.

91
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,000
Hold on.

92
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,440
Officer,it must be a misunderstanding.

93
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,160
May I call my lawyer?

94
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,610
Yes. You may call it on the way back to the police station.

95
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,440
Is it true that he broke the rules? What's going on?

96
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,150
Cheers!

97
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,200
Miss Qin looks pretty today.

98
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,570
Am I right,Xiao Rui?

99
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,900
Yes,she's pretty.

100
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,480
Congratulation on our victory!

101
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,160
This is the cheque that I've brought to Ping Zhou.

102
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,680
However,it's from UBS bank and may be a little troublesome.

103
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,360
I have no idea,too. Why don't you settle it,Xiao Yun?

104
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,400
Take it.

105
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,440
What's wrong? Why are you so quiet?

106
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,280
What can I say?

107
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,200
I'm so blessed.

108
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,800
I've finally become a rich man!

109
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,600
Rich man,...

110
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,360
...please calm down!

111
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,600
Thank you,Zhuang Rui.

112
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,680
Why did you thank me?

113
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,370
Thank you for everything that you've done for us.

114
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,240
Zhuang Rui,I want to thank you,too.

115
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,800
Why?

116
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,520
For the alimony and medical fee of my colleague,...

117
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,400
...I'll pay you back.

118
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,560
Pengfei,I helped you because I respect and admire you.

119
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,520
We're friends and brothers.

120
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,120
Don't mention it again.

121
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,200
Then,...

122
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,620
...I shall be your bodyguard.

123
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,400
I didn't expect to gain any reward from you.

124
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,880
However..... -Stop thinking about it.

125
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,440
Aren't we friends? Aren't we brothers?

126
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,160
Feel free to look for me when you're in Beijing.

127
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,600
That's the way! We shouldn't be courteous to each other.

128
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,000
Let's drink! -Cheers!

129
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,200
Let's drink!

130
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,560
When can it be done?

131
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,160
I've told the officer twice just now.

132
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,560
I told him clearly.

133
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,200
When can I go back?

134
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,280
Why are you so impatient?

135
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,060
For the case of Ping Zhou Auction,...

136
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,000
...I'm done.

137
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,000
You haven't told me about the murder case of Mr Yu.

138
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,560
Who is he? What's wrong with him?

139
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,760
Didn't I tell you before? I don't know him.

140
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,080
Can't you understand my words?

141
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,720
Do you understand Mandarin?

142
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,080
I don't know him and I've never seen him before.

143
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,520
Do you understand?

144
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,680
The car is over there.

145
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,600
Sister Fei. -Zhao.

146
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,170
How's the progress?

147
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,880
We found out that it's hard to find someone who can make...

148
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,840
...the special arrow nowadays.

149
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,600
The scope has been narrowed down. I think we can find him soon.

150
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,200
Xu Wei is released on bail. You have to act fast.

151
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,080
Okay,I got it.

152
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,120
It's almost a day,right?

153
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,760
It's about 20 hours.

154
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,040
His stamina is poor now.

155
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,440
He was the marathon champion when we were in high school.

156
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,560
Why did he end up like this? -Stop talking about the past.

157
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,600
I used to join the triathlon. I've become fat,too.

158
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,970
Shall we wake him up?

159
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,360
Let him sleep.

160
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,280
Time and tide wait for no man.

161
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,480
Time.....

162
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,480
Who were you referring to?

163
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,160
You did a great job in Ping Zhou. Why do you look listless?

164
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,200
It happened too suddenly. It feels like a dream.

165
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,600
Life is like a dream. Only those who have gone through it...

166
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,120
...would know how it feels.

167
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,280
It's just a matter of time.

168
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,240
However,your capability...

169
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,920
...is much better than your peers.

170
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,920
Sometimes,you're too humble...

171
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,480
...which makes you unconfident.

172
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,880
This is very normal.

173
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,610
Becoming rich suddenly...

174
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,720
...is the most unrealistic thing in the world.

175
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,160
Therefore,many people are known as parvenus.

176
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,640
It's probably because...

177
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,920
...they feel unrealistic to become rich suddenly.

178
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,480
However,...

179
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,100
...money wasn't the most important thing that you gained,...

180
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,420
...it was the chance for you to prove yourself that counts.

181
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,680
You mean the chance to prove myself?

182
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,480
You have a good eye and good luck in gambling stone.

183
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,200
It left a deep impression on many people.

184
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,200
Your success rate is high.

185
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,720
Some people even call you as the "King of Jade.

186
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,200
You don't even have to join in the following auctions...

187
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,860
...but your name will definitely be mentioned.

188
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,200
Some people who are superstitious...

189
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,360
...may even pray to you.

190
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,520
You're going to be the god of stone soon.

191
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,920
Please don't make fun of me, Uncle De. It's impossible.

192
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,520
I'm not kidding. It's true.

193
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,890
You should know that...

194
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,680
...you're a better man than you thought.

195
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,840
You're famous now,...

196
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,080
...therefore you must treasure yourself.

197
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:19,829
Okay,I got it.

198
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,160
Uncle De.

199
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:30,080
I have to leave now. -Okay.

200
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,240
No way,my friend.

201
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,240
You have to at least pay me this amount.

202
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,680
Is this okay?

203
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,800
If not,you may choose from other stalls.

204
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,360
Xiao Yun,what's wrong?

205
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,560
What's wrong! -Surprise!

206
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,800
Who is celebrating his birthday today?

207
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,040
No one is celebrating his birthday.

208
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,680
What are you trying to do? -They bought the shop...

209
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,520
...for you.

210
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,600
Brother Ma put all these things...

211
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,000
...for you.

212
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,600
How is it? The decoration is nice,right?

213
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,120
We can't call him as our little brother anymore.

214
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,220
We must call him "Boss.

215
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,520
Boss Zhuang.

216
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,800
Brother Ma,do you think I can be a good boss?

217
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,360
Boss Zhuang.

218
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,200
You have to work from the bottom...

219
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,080
...before you can be a real boss.

220
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,360
Boss Zhuang,this is a grand opening gift.

221
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,800
May your business prosper.

222
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,240
Thank you.

223
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,960
You're all so nice. I'm speechless now.

224
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,330
You may just keep quiet.

225
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,840
Why don't we name the shop?

226
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,800
Yes,it's important. You have to decide it.

227
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,820
Let's start with the name.

228
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,800
Let's call it as "Ma....."

229
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,930
It has nothing to do with me.

230
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,360
Then we call it as "Zhuang....."

231
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,040
Why don't we call it as "Ruiyunzhai"

232
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,800
"Ruiyunzhai"?

233
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,160
It's elegant and nice.

234
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,960
Our names are in it,too.

235
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,040
Ruiyunzhai is good. -Okay,let's call it that.

236
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,240
Let's celebrate it!

237
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,560
Make a fortune!

238
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,600
Mr. Zhuang,I'm the one who sends you the jade.

239
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,080
The traffic police said that our...

240
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,520
...travelling pass to Beijing cannot be used.

241
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,440
Can you send a car to get your jade?

242
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,160
Where are you now?

243
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,440
I'll send you the location.

244
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,800
Sure,I'll send a car now. -Hurry up.

245
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,600
Please wait for me there. -Okay.

246
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,040
Alright,bye! -Bye!

247
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,480
We have to get a car to get the jade.

248
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,480
Okay,I have the contact of a rented car.

249
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,200
Why are you here? -You're well informed.

250
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,530
We've just opened the shop yesterday and you're here today.

251
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,960
I saw Mr. Huangfu's friends' circle.

252
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,760
Do you need a security guard?

253
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,520
I have no talent except for my strength.

254
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,160
I could do the heavy job.

255
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,640
If you don't mind,let's work together in the future.

256
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,780
Thank you,Boss. -Don't call me that.

257
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,860
Call me Zhuang Rui.

258
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,240
Call me Xiao Yun.

259
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,440
Welcome to join Ruiyunzhai.

260
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:03,960
Thank you.

261
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,120
Put your bag down.

262
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,840
Have a look. Make yourself at home.

263
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,170
Okay.

264
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,600
Zhuang Rui,I'm in Beijing.

265
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,060
Are you free? Let's have a meal together.

266
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,280
I have to take the jade now.

267
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,600
It'll take some time.

268
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,680
Let's go together.

269
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,280
Sure,I'll see you later.

270
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,080
Is it Miss Qin again?

271
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,800
I need to take something at the countryside,come with me.

272
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,460
No problem.

273
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,160
What about me?

274
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,810
Stay here and take care of the shop.

275
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,220
Did I get it correctly?

276
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,720
Take care of the shop.

277
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,160
Fine,I'll take care of the shop.

278
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,980
Why do we have to go all the way there to take the jade?

279
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,580
There is something wrong with the travelling pass.

280
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,720
The road is dangerous. Drive slowly.

281
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:58,320
The brake is not working. Watch out!

282
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:58,920
Watch out!

283
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,080
Fei!

284
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,440
Miss Qin!

285
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,160
Fei!

286
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,320
Miss Qin!

287
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,040
Miss Qin! Fei!

288
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,080
Miss Qin!

289
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,360
Pengfei,wake up!

290
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,920
How long have you been in the jewellery field?

291
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,240
You want to own the market now.

292
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,720
Are you dreaming,Qin Haoran?

293
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,600
Mr Lim.

294
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,460
Please don't be agitated. I'm not dreaming.

295
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:15,120
I'm trying to help you. You were evading debt overseas...

296
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,000
...for many years.

297
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,260
It's sad that you can't come back.

298
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,200
You're shedding your crocodile tears.

299
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,400
Who caused this?

300
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,920
Weren't you the one who caused this?

301
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,680
You're tall and strong.

302
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,720
However,what you have done is like this.

303
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,480
You're an evil man.

304
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,720
Mr. Lim,you misunderstood my kindness.

305
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,020
Did you say your kindness?

306
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,200
You only have an evil thought.

307
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,320
You want to defeat all of us.

308
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,800
You're too greedy.

309
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,680
We have our strengths,too.

310
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,500
Are you sure that you can defeat all of us?

311
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,400
Are you up for it?

312
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,400
Of course I'm up for it.

313
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,200
Stop struggling anymore.

314
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,170
Have you read the newspaper today?

315
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,220
You used money to buy the news.

316
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,840
I'm not afraid at all!

317
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,000
Are the news true?

318
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,120
You know it better.

319
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,520
It isn't a smart way for you.

320
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,400
The share that you've mortgaged to the bank...

321
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,400
...can't be taken back anymore.

322
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,600
You'll end up...

323
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,760
...with nothing.

324
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,800
Have a look.

325
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,080
This is the opening quotation...

326
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,280
...and the valuation report of your company.

327
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,920
It dropped 9.5% within a day.

328
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,080
The result is clear.

329
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,660
How long do you think you can survive?

330
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:31,320
Hello. Sir,you have a call.

331
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:31,970
Okay.

332
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,480
Gentlemen.

333
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,900
Please sign the contract.

334
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,000
The pens are right there.

335
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,880
Don't worry. As shareholders of Xi Huang Jewellery,...

336
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,720
...your family will be supported by the bonus every term...

337
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,400
...until you pass away.

338
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,920
If you don't accept our kindness,...

339
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,880
...the bank manager will be waiting for you next door...

340
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,680
...to calculate your assets.

341
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,240
You're not fit to talk with us.

342
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,680
Qin Haoran.

343
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,440
Were you the one who...

344
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,840
...set the trap of the loan?

345
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,960
You're too ruthless.

346
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,520
Okay.

347
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,400
Qin Haoran, I'm asking you a question!

348
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,240
I got it.

349
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,260
Let's go to the airport. -Yes.

350
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,000
Mr. Qin!

351
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:49,760
I sold you the jade during the auction in Italy...

352
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,840
...so that you could have a great performance.

353
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,560
I had expressed my gratitude to you for that...

354
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,760
...and paid you back.

355
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,720
I don't owe you anything.

356
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,000
I can be kind to you...

357
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,400
...but capitalism can't.

358
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,880
You have four minutes.

359
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,160
Your injury isn't serious but you have to take a good rest.

360
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,800
Miss,what about the lady...

361
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,280
..who came with me just now? -She is in the VIP ward.

362
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:10,000
She must be from a rich family.

363
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,890
Was it done by Xu family?

364
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,600
It should be them.

365
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,960
In the auction,...

366
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,020
...they suffered great loss.

367
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,720
Knowing Xu Wei,he's definitely angry with Zhuang Rui.

368
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,360
He didn't expect that you were in the car.

369
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,160
This may not be a piece of bad news for us.

370
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,720
Sir,I'll go out first.

371
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,480
He's right.

372
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,520
If we use the accident as an excuse,...

373
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,490
...in order to apologise to us,...

374
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,440
...Xu family will...

375
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,920
...give us some purchasing and investment rights in the future.

376
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,840
For us to have a stable development in the mainland,...

377
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,080
...that's very important.

378
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,210
You are really my daughter.

379
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,200
However,it is definitely not enough...

380
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,460
...to only gain some interest from them.

381
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,320
You mean.....

382
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,530
We'll do it step by step. Don't worry about it.

383
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,120
I'm worried about you now.

384
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,440
I'm fine.

385
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,320
Didn't the doctor say it?

386
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:57,200
It's good for me to take a break,too.

387
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:03,500
Lumang can't help you anymore since his identity was exposed.

388
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,120
If you don't have a capable assistant,...

389
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,940
...I'll be worried about you.

390
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,920
Let Ah'Gui follow you for now.

391
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,320
It's okay,father.

392
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,800
Be good.

393
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,520
Only then,I can rest my mind.

394
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,000
Okay.

395
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,580
You're Zhuang Rui.

396
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,640
Mr. Qin.

397
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,100
I'm sorry,Mr. Qin.

398
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,320
Xuanbing went to get the jade with me...

399
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,760
...and got injured.

400
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:16,480
It was an accident. Don't blame yourself.

401
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,560
She's fine.

402
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,409
Please go in.

403
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,170
How are you feeling?

404
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,320
I'm fine.

405
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,920
My daughter has been praising you.

406
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,280
She said that you have a good judgement and loyal to friends.

407
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,080
Moreover,...

408
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:04,480
...you helped us

409
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,250
...to buy the red jade with a low price in the auction.

410
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,560
I had been wanting to meet you.

411
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,960
Mr. Qin,I'm flattered.

412
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,680
Don't be so courteous. If you don't mind,...

413
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,840
...you may call me Uncle Qin.

414
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,640
Okay,Uncle Qin.

415
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,410
You're a good child.

416
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,040
Sir,you have a call.

417
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,090
Okay.

418
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:42,040
I have to answer the call. Both of you talk.

419
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,920
Sir,it's Xu Zhendong.

420
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,040
What are you holding?

421
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,880
Is it for me?

422
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,320
Yes,I thought you will taste bitter after the anaesthetics,...

423
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,080
...so I bought some fruit for you.

424
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,040
However,...

425
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,040
...I think it's not worth mentioning.

426
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,760
My father's friends sent those gifts.

427
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,460
They just chose the most expensive ones.

428
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,680
Their gifts can't compare with your mangosteens.

429
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,920
They sent the gifts to meet my father.

430
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,850
It's merely a form of socialising.

431
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,040
Is it?

432
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,480
Then you may eat these. I chose them carefully.

433
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,440
It's all good.

434
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,200
You have a good taste.

435
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,920
Uncle,how is Bingbing?

436
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,660
It's just a minor surgery.

437
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,200
She may be discharged soon. Qin Haoran said that she has...

438
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,680
...recuperate and ask us not to disturb her.

439
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,960
He wants to meet us a few days later.

440
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,960
Didn't he say the reason?

441
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:44,280
We're going to work together, of course we have to discuss it.

442
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,720
Qin Xuanbing got injured...

443
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,920
...and many agents went to visit her in the hospital.

444
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,320
You have to visit her more frequently,too.

445
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,640
I'll definitely visit her.

446
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,440
Do you know that Qin family...

447
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,640
...has just merged with a few jewellery companies?

448
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,880
Xi Huang Jewellery...

449
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,760
...has many good materials...

450
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,880
...and they've just gotten the red jade from Ping Zhou.

451
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,640
Mr. Qin is well-prepared.

452
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,560
Qin Xuanbing is getting closer with Zhuang Rui...

453
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,840
...and you're under investigation now.

454
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,660
When can you make some achievements?

455
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,680
We had the advantage at first...

456
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,480
...but how much you can gain at the end...

457
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,040
...depends on your luck.

458
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:45,160
Uncle,it can't that serious,can it?

459
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,200
You're bad in seeing the situation.

460
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,620
If you are on a par with Zhuang Rui,...

461
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,890
...you wouldn't end up in this plight.

462
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:42,320
Sister,we've found an old smith.

463
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,240
Tell me.

464
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,560
He's the only one who can make this arrow.

465
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,680
He adds arsenic in the metal...

466
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,880
...and it prevents blood clotting.

467
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,200
Sister,do you know how he makes them?

468
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,200
He uses sand-cast...

469
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,000
...and adds.....

470
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,380
Where is he now?

471
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,650
Are you really alright?

472
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,920
I tell you,health is most important for rich people like us.

473
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,280
Just stay a while more in the hospital.

474
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,360
A scar has formed.

475
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,260
Let me hold you.

476
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,720
Where's Peng Fei?

477
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,040
It's weird.

478
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,360
He's not wounded.

479
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,800
He came back with a long face after taking notes.

480
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,040
And,he'd stay at home for 2 days,shortest.

481
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,490
He says that he's waiting for a phone call.

482
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:50,770
Let's go.

483
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,680
I'll hold you. -It's alright. I'm fine.

484
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,840
Alright,thank you. I know.

485
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,980
We'll cooperate our best.

486
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,080
Fei,you're here.

487
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,840
Fei,you've finally gotten the call?

488
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,680
Is it your family members or a girl?

489
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,720
Let me tell you, don't give up just yet.

490
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,000
What a true proverb,"blessings in disguise come as accidents".

491
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,920
There won't be blessings without accidents,right?

492
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,320
Don't let little things get in the way of making money.

493
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,600
This wasn't an accident.
