00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,000
The Golden Eyes

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 38

3
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,080
On the day of our wedding anniversary,...

4
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,479
...I prepared a candlelight dinner.

5
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,520
However,when Victor returned home,...

6
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,720
...he didn't remember what day it was.

7
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,160
He might been too busy and have forgotten.

8
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,680
Yes,you should have reminded him.

9
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,240
I don't think so.

10
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,800
Here's the exciting part. I didn't even get to remind him.

11
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,280
When he got home,he received a call and left the house.

12
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,560
Not only did he forgot our wedding anniversary,...

13
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,200
...he left after a call and wouldn't tell me who it was.

14
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,079
Tell me, should I put up with this?

15
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,240
You should not!

16
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,320
I even waited for him with the candles lit.

17
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,360
In the end,he didn't even return after the candles burned out.

18
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,600
He deserves to die.

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,200
He should be buried in a nameless grave!

20
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,120
Don't create trouble. Just wait for him to return...

21
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,920
...and light the candles again.

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,240
I think Victor is in the wrong...

23
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,420
...and he owes you an apology.

24
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,960
I just want an explanation so I won't be confused.

25
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,160
Is there another woman? -Yes,that must be the case.

26
00:02:57,079 --> 00:03:00,360
However,he wouldn't give in so I divorced him.

27
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,320
I still don't feel settled.

28
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,640
So I sent my bodyguard to steal his red diamond.

29
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,480
I left my favourite tulip...

30
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,440
...and told him that if he wants the red diamond,...

31
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,700
...he has to apologize to me personally.

32
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,400
I sent men to create a scene and planted Xiaokai at the museum.

33
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,560
I want pictures of Victor looking flustered.

34
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,100
I want pictures of him apologizing to me.

35
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,880
Okay,I have a way. Let the 3 of us go.

36
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,160
When you bring the red diamond tomorrow,...

37
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:40,160
...I will make sure Victor has an explanation for you.

38
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,240
Yes,let us speak to Victor.

39
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,600
We promise you an apology, all right?

40
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,480
How do I know you won't play games with me?

41
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,600
No,look at our faces. There's honesty written on it.

42
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,880
We won't play any games. -Don't worry.

43
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,500
I'll interrogate him for you.

44
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,440
What about this? I'll let you two go.

45
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,640
I'll bring the red diamond to the museum tomorrow.

46
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,720
However,she has to stay.

47
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,360
I'll stay,you two can go.

48
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,720
Are you crazy?

49
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,720
No,we'll leave together.

50
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,640
Either she stays or none of you are leaving.

51
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,080
Make your choice.

52
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,020
We need to find Nakagawa Ryosuke.

53
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,480
I'll stay.

54
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,360
You two should go.

55
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,840
Don't worry,I won't harm her.

56
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,159
Unless,the outcome is disappointing.

57
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,500
We'll not disappoint you.

58
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,840
Right? Let's go.

59
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,960
You knew from the beginning...

60
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,360
...who took the red diamond,right?

61
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,770
Also,you didn't say that tulips are your wife's favourite.

62
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,480
There was also a note on the anti-theft glass.

63
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,720
I'm really sorry for that.

64
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:42,240
I didn't want this to happen between me and Yelena.

65
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,720
However,I didn't cheat on her. Why must I give in?

66
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,520
You didn't want to apologize and used us.

67
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,400
Now,my friend is in danger.

68
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,800
Yelena has a bad temper and is rash.

69
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,560
Feifei,you'll die a terrible death!

70
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,520
What is she fed us to the sharks?

71
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,800
Yelena only knows Taekwondo...

72
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,800
...but she has an ultimate move.

73
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,240
She would slam me on the ground when she's mad.

74
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,690
Are we doing it for real?

75
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,360
It was only a warmup earlier.

76
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,280
Tell me,my husband,...

77
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,040
...no,ex-husband,...

78
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,960
...besides work,does he have me in his heart?

79
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,040
Oblivious Zhuang Rui.

80
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,480
Why does he think I only get angry?

81
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,600
Who does he think I'm angry for?

82
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,000
Miss,Nakagawa Ryosuke doesn't have the Tamamoku stone.

83
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,840
He knows he's being followed so he won't have the stone on him.

84
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,040
He will find a safe and insured place.

85
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,920
That would be the vault in Victor's museum.

86
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,960
You'll check it out one of these days.

87
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,920
Yes.

88
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,040
Yelena,I'm sorry...

89
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,520
...for forgetting our wedding anniversary.

90
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,400
May I have your hand?

91
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,200
Yelena,please forgive me.

92
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,320
Forgive me for not remembering our wedding anniversary.

93
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,400
I've neglected our relationship.

94
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,080
I didn't apologize due to pride. It's the stupidest thing...

95
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,440
...that I've done in my life.

96
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,520
After our separation, I thought long and hard.

97
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,820
I realized that I can't live without you.

98
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,200
We couldn't go to South America...

99
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,400
...but I've brought the Iguazu Falls here.

100
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,720
Yelena,...

101
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,200
...would you marry me again?

102
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,080
Yes.

103
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,450
All these while,...

104
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,960
...I thought this place was the most important thing to me.

105
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,940
Now,I realize that...

106
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,400
...the most important thing to me...

107
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,360
...is you.

108
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,440
I didn't expect Victor to be so romantic.

109
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,600
That was Xiaorui's idea.

110
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,810
You're quite the romantic.

111
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,530
Cherish the person in front of you.

112
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,010
Cherish the person behind you.

113
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,040
Don't touch her! -You'll go first,then.

114
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,760
Come on!

115
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,360
Twinkle,twinkle,little star,...

116
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,720
...how I wonder what you are.

117
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,480
Don't go.

118
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,760
Officer Miao, what do you think?

119
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,880
It's quite romantic.

120
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,520
Is it?

121
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:44,120
Honey. -Miss Xiaojia,did you miss me?

122
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,160
I found a very romantic place.

123
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,000
Really?

124
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,760
I don't know if you'd want to go there with me.

125
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,440
Where is it?

126
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,800
It's a secret.

127
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,800
This place...

128
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,440
...is the most important place for me.

129
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,200
So I must bring someone I love the most there.

130
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,240
That person is you.

131
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:12,840
Silly.

132
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,140
Would you go there with me?

133
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,890
Mr. Zhuang,thank you. If weren't for you,...

134
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,400
...I wouldn't know what I'm being stubborn for.

135
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,920
Thank you,Zhuang Rui. You did great.

136
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,280
You knew the red diamond was behind Marc Chagall's painting.

137
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,420
You also knew the password to the safe is his birthdate.

138
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,280
Mr. Victor, do we still have a deal?

139
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,560
Of course.

140
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,400
Unfortunately,I don't know Nakagawa's whereabouts.

141
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,400
However, I can bring you to see...

142
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,960
...the things that he left behind.

143
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,760
The Tamamoku stone's in the safe. Come with me.

144
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,800
What are you thinking about?

145
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,080
All this started with the Tamamoku stone.

146
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,760
Now,...

147
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,340
...I'm finally getting closure.

148
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,080
What's wrong?

149
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,200
It's nothing.

150
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,360
I must have seen wrongly.

151
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,800
Don't worry. We have a tight security.

152
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,130
No one will be able to trespass freely.

153
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,480
Let's go.

154
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,320
This vault was built in 1746.

155
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,800
It used to be a prison for felons.

156
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,760
When the museum was built, the security door was installed.

157
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,400
Trespassers will be trapped once they enter...

158
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,920
...and have no chance of escaping.

159
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,480
I've seen this in movies.

160
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,040
I'm sorry, you can't touch the door.

161
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,840
I can't even touch it?

162
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,700
Is it gold-plated?

163
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,530
Let me tell you,you haven't seen a real criminal.

164
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,360
If I were a robber,I would place an explosive at the door.

165
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,800
That would do it.

166
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,280
Will it still trap me then? Am I right?

167
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,920
Most of the valuable collections are stored here.

168
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,400
They are displayed during certain times.

169
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,200
The Tamamoku stone is in the safe.

170
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,280
This is it.

171
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,320
This is the Tamamoku stone?

172
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,200
It doesn't look special at all.

173
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,250
Zhuang Rui. -What's wrong?

174
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,040
Zhuang Rui. -What's with you?

175
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,440
Are you all right?

176
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,960
I'm sorry,Mr. Zhuang. This is Nakagawa Ryosuke's private asset.

177
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,560
No one is allowed to touch it without his permission.

178
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,380
Mr. Victor,the Tamamoku stone is important to Zhuang Rui.

179
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,090
Could you please make an exception this time?

180
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,240
I'm only doing my duty as told.

181
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,120
The Chinese have a saying, courtesy calls for reciprocity.

182
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,280
It means, when I've helped you out,...

183
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,680
...you should help me in return,right?

184
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,130
We went through a lot to retrieve the red diamond for you.

185
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,160
There's no one around. Let him take a peek.

186
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,120
If it was anything else, I'm happy to obliged.

187
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:00,040
However,I can't let you touch the Tamamoku stone.

188
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,920
Aren't we your friends? -Nakagawa is my friend,too.

189
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,440
What is it?

190
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,840
Wait a minute.

191
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,100
What's that sound?

192
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,820
Have you checked the place? -Doors and windows not broken.

193
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,600
They're still in the museum. Search the place.

194
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,880
Zhuang Rui.

195
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,320
Are you all right?

196
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,680
What happened out there? -You're injured.

197
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,520
Don't worry about this. Leave it to us.

198
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,360
Make a call to Yelena. Ask her to send help.

199
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,000
Let me have a look.

200
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,780
The injury isn't too serious.

201
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,480
So it's you.

202
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,380
Taking advantage of Grandfather Gu's case,...

203
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,680
...you lured me to Kiev.

204
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,720
Did you plan all this?

205
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,360
You approached me...

206
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,640
...to use me...

207
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,580
...to get the Tamamoku stone.

208
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,680
Is it?

209
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,480
What are human lives to you?

210
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,120
Zhuang Rui.

211
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,280
You know very well...

212
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,660
...that's my only hope of surviving.

213
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,800
I'm sorry.

214
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,200
Did you find them?

215
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,440
It's Qin Xuanbing. She took the Tamamoku stone.

216
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,560
I knew she wouldn't help us without a motive.

217
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,320
Don't worry.

218
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,180
We'll definitely find it.

219
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,940
They've escaped through the broken window at the back.

220
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,480
Let's go.

221
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,450
What do we do now?

222
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,300
Do you think she's at her home in Kiev?

223
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,680
I don't think so. -Why?

224
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,840
She knows that we know her home address.

225
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,040
She'll be taking a risk if she returns home with the stone.

226
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,280
Could she have..... -Could she have what?

227
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,490
Could she have return to China? -Return to China?

228
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,900
It's possible.

229
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,800
As they've been exposed,...

230
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,480
...staying here would be to their disadvantage.

231
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,450
So they must find ways to bring the stone to China.

232
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,160
There's 4 to 5 roads leading to the airport.

233
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,770
Which one do we take?

234
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,850
I've totally forgotten about her.

235
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,320
Victor called me.

236
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:13,770
He said Nakagawa Ryosuke's Tamamoku stone was stolen.

237
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,320
You came just in time. They went that way.

238
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,670
It was a black car.

239
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,000
Plate number AA 2828 EK.

240
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,800
Occupational habit. -Do we have a plan now?

241
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,230
Who are they?

242
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,400
Two Chinese nationals. -Chinese? Why would they.....

243
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:35,280
Yelena,we have no time to explain to you.

244
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,760
However,we need your help. Could your men...

245
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,100
...drive along all routes to the airport to catch them?

246
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,600
Andrea,drive along all routes to the airport.

247
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,520
One more thing.

248
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,710
Could you lend us a car? It's easier when we split up.

249
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,670
Sure.

250
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,520
Could we be wrong?

251
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,680
Maybe Qin Xuanbing is not returning to China.

252
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,720
What? I'm sure they've gone back to China.

253
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,040
Nakagawa Ryosuke.

254
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,690
Stop the car!

255
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,850
What are you doing here?

256
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,560
If I'm not mistaken, they've taken my Tamamoku stone.

257
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,920
You're a killer and have the audacity to be in the open.

258
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,480
When I got news of Mr. Gu's death,I knew...

259
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,180
...that you would look for me.

260
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,000
Yes,I've been looking for you.

261
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,060
I will make sure you're captured to avenge Grandfather Gu.

262
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,600
How are you so sure that I killed Mr. Gu?

263
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,800
Evidence. It's because I have hard evidence.

264
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,800
How is your health? Be honest to your grandfather.

265
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:46,480
I'm doing fine. It's nothing,see?

266
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,420
Your eyes.....

267
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,680
Xiaorui,stay put. I'll be back in a while.

268
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,720
Grandfather Gu!

269
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,380
"Tell me about the expedition at Room 102. Nakagawa Ryosuke."

270
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,200
Mr. Zhuang,couldn't the evidence be fabricated?

271
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:29,120
The real killer could've done that on purpose.

272
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,480
What about an explanation? I need an explanation!

273
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,640
Mr. Zhuang, I didn't kill Mr. Gu.

274
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,320
Stop quibbling. Just admit that you did it.

275
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,880
We can talk this out in peace...

276
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,340
...but now's not the time.

277
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,280
Hello,Yelena. -I found them.

278
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,120
Send your location to me. I'll be right there.

279
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,640
All right. -Okay.

280
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,400
They found Qin Xuanbing.

281
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,720
Mr. Zhuang,retrieving the Tamamoku stone is our priority.

282
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:22,160
When this is over,I'll look for you personally. Trust me.

283
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,920
All of you just to catch the two us?

284
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,240
Hand me the item.

285
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,080
Are you crazy?
